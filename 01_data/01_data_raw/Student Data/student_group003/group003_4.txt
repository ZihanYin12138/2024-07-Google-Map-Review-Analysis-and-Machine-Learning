<Text>Most of the time it’s not bad, one day this person help me he made me do all the work and he overcharged me for a simple plastic bag. It almost seems like you they don’t get paid by AMAZON / UPS for helping customers so they don’t like doing it, there’s no courtesy No smiles, very dry and unfriendly atmosphere.In fact thinking about it, I think when they receive UPS packages they actually don’t get paid for that work, that’s why they try to nickel and dime people so it pays for the employees time, they only make money when they’re shipping or providing other services I think that’s the way it is

<Text>I drove all the way to the store to drop a package. I checked their hours of operation beforehand. I arrive with ample time before closing, as an employee was walking out. He saw me go to the store and tells me "its closed, covid hours". I say thats understandable but you guys need to update your store hours online and on google maps because it states that your store is open. The employee then tells me "complain to corporate, that has nothing to do with me". As this exchange happens with the employee happens, I  literally watch 8 different people walk up to the closed store. As I write this review, more people are coming up. Thank you for wasting all our time UPS. Please update your store hours, and also consider employing people with some basic customer service skills.<//Text>< Pics>

Stopped by the DC store for packages I needed to print labels for and send out plus an Amazon return. Overall the process was very easy,  especially the Amazon return! Curtis assisted me that day and was friendly and fast</text>

Don't bother insuring packages here. Package went missing after I sent it in on 3/9 and ups hasn't paid me out as of 5/11. I guess the terms of insurance are more of a suggestion. A police report was even filed!

They also seem to hang up the phone a lot< /text>

The associates here were charged with boxing and shipping my Amazon returns. 2 out of 3 were delivered 2 days after dropping them off. The last shipment has not been updated since the label was created 8 days ago. This has never happened to me ever. Following up, a male associated proceeded to tell me that Amazon was in charge of providing me updates..HAHA what. Mind you, I had a UPS tracking number and a UPS receipt. Returning items to Amazon is as easy a process as any return process can be. Now, I'm dealing with endless customer service calls. Do not entrust the employees here with your goods, especially if you're expecting a refund.<//text>

<rate>4< /rate><text>Preferred location for Amazon Drop-offs and returns.
I use this UPS location for Amazon drop-offs and returns.  The location is convenient with plenty of free parking outside the store.  Service at the store is a bit of mix bag.  Sometimes there can be long line and sometimes it is a breeze, but I get impression that clerks are not very knowledgeable.  The Amazon return process is very easy if you know what you have to do, be ready with your scan code.< /text>< Pics>

< Review>
Beware!! I have always used this store to ship without issue, but the last time I took in a package the attendant charged me for the envelope, didn't put a shipping sticker on it and went into the back room, leaving the package on the package scale.  Something seemed way off so I tried to get her attention to finish my transaction, but another attendant had to come over and help me. She told me that the other attendant had only charged me for the envelope as if nothing strange had happened, finished the transaction and charged me for the shipping, labeled the envelope and put it in the appropriate place.  It seems that the first attendant was planning on stealing my package?!?!?! WT!!!  I felt lucky that my package actually arrived after anxiously waiting to see if it would get there.  Bottom line though, I won't go back to this location until the  bad shady customer service is addressed.< /Review>

Between choosing USPS and UPS, I prefer driving to Westlake to go to UPS for a few reasons. First, parking isn't a hassle, especially when there's an easy exit near Nation's. Second, there usually isn't a line or long wait time. Third, whenever a customer enters UPS, those behind the counter are usually welcoming and eager to help with mailing/fax/copy questions. And lastly, whether it's to drop off or mail a package, it doesn't take longer than five to ten minutes.<//text>

<text>Total scam!  I packaged my old TV in its original manufacturer box along with all the foam, plastic wrap etc.  I dropped the TV at this UPS store in Westlake and they happily accepted the TV for shipping to my brother.  They also happily accepted the extra fees to insure the shipment, all in all it was over $150 to ship with the insurance.

Needless to say, the TV was destroyed.  The glass panel was cracked in multiple places.  After months of trying to sort out the insurance claim, UPS of Westlake told me my claim was rejected BECAUSE I USED A "CUSTOMER-SUPPLIED" BOX.  The store is of no help - they just sell insurance but couldn't care less if UPS ever pays a claim.  If they cared they would have told me that UPS doesn't insure self-wrapped packages. Instead their employee encouraged me to buy it and happily took my money.

Their scam won't pay if they lose more customers than scamming on insurance gains them.  I told them I could never bring my shipping there again, and I fully intend to follow through with that.</text>< resp>

Don’t come to this store! They CHARGE things WITHOUT TELLING YOU and don’t show the items & prices charged on receipt! Also, their prices are always ridiculous based on my experiences and others’ reviews here.
$12 for a medium-sized box?! If you didn’t tape your package, they will charge $4-5 for just taping it. Or you can buy a new tape from them for $8.
For printing, besides charging by number of papers you print, it’s $1/min if you need to use their computer and network to send your docs to their printer.<//Text>

I used ups service and paid $5 two days ago. Today I’ve seen among my credit card transactions from the same merchant $5 charged and $19,95 in pending. What the hell?! I didn’t do anymore. Why I’m in charge?
I called them they say they cannot answer for this.
THANK YOU UPS!
Never come to this store.< /Review>

This is a great place to wash your clothes. It's always clean and the staff is friendly. There are plenty of machines, which makes it super fast, and it's rarely too busy to find a spot to wash. We love going here!</text>

<Review>Excellent drop off service.  We were on vacation, staying near here and needed to clean some laundry.  For $18 (minimum amount) this place washed a full bag of ocean water-soaked clothes and had them cleaned, dried, and folded in two hours.  Who wants to spend 2 hours while on vacation waiting on the machines?  $18 was a great price</Review><gmapID>0x80dc724065792069:0xa08513e951337afe<//gmapID><Rate>5< /Rate>< UserId.>

<text>Great location. Easy to get to.
1 top  loading washer wasn’t working. One had something sitting in it with the tub full of water.

The cost is $2.50 per top load wash and it goes up from there.
Drying is $.25 for 8 minutes. Choose wisely. Some dry faster than others depending on the status of the lint filter being cleaned out.

There is one bench to sit on.... you’ll be standing for the 31 (min minimum) to wash and 8 (min minimum) to dry (if you are lucky).

Staff was busy working and the place was clean.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80dc724065792069:0xa08513e951337afe</gmap_id></record>

Very clean laundromat.  Plenty of machines.  A good assortment of small and large machines to get your clothes done.  Staff was helpful.  Free wifi helps pass the time. I don't use laundromats often, really haven't used one in a couple of decades, but the prices didn't seem unreasonable.< /review>

Is hard to have a place near home these days, but this place is ok, I recommend spray cleaning the inside of a washer before use.< /Review>

After washing clothes, I needed to use the dryer but didn't have any singles. I asked the lady that works here for singles in a exchange for a $5,  so that i wouldnt have to put an entire $5 in the quarter machine.

She rudely said no as if i was trying to rob her or something. Could've politely said we dont give singles or something, but spoke to me as if she had something against, probably a racist. I wont come back.</Text>

<Review>We used the wash and fold service because we were in vacation and didn't wan't to wait around.   Clothes came back promptly (as was promised).  Service personal was nice and the place appeared very clean and well maintained.  Will be using again the next time we are in town.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Although, many of the so called with women are pereanodie with the customers that are here to clean there clothing. A person can certainly see why there single... In fact for I am only Mexican/German mix, I can see why the Hispanic folks are much nicer people.. That's why I had to bring my 5 star rating down 1 because of these White women, who are also very piss-y people... They certainly need to work more on their people manners...< /Review>< pictures>

There are a LOT of washing machines all different sizes.  There are also plenty of very large dryers with a sign that says they fit 2 wash loads per dryer.  Washers are pre-set prices (based on load size) and the dryers are $0.25 for 8 minutes.  There are two change machines ($1,$5,$10) and a detergent vending machine with the following choices: Oxi Clean, Bounce, Tide, Gain, Downy, and Clorox2.  There isn't a ton of seating, but this place is pretty clean and there is plenty of parking.  I haven't used too many laundromats, but this one seems good.</review>

<Time>1549478979710< /Time><text>I have been coming here for the past 7 years. I would normally go during the week in the evening. A couple of times I would forget clothes in the washer or dryer and would come back the next day and would find my stuff. But just recently I left a tote bag with a brand new bottle of Detergent and Softener and my wallet with all my personal items and cash. Went back a couple of hours and no one seen nothing or turn nothing in. So I contacted the Owner and to my luck he was out of town and he advised he is not sure if the cameras are even up and running because he hasn't had to use or check them for quite some time and mention of the 3 day limit of saving the data. Why have cameras if they don't work? Another customer their informed me that she had left a brand new detergent soap on top of the washer and went next door to eat and when she came back it was gone. If you are a loyal customer here PLEASE be careful with your personal belongings!!</text>< name>

<text>I was greeted promptly and in a friendly manner, I was in and out in less than an hour. All staff members that I had contact with were great. One young woman was particularly funny with a wonderful personality, I wish I remembered her name. She is well suited for her job.
I am loving the rainbow masks.< /text></record>

<Text>Empire Eye & Laser Center is a highly professional organization.  The staff are all welcoming, efficient, courteous and well trained.  Everything goes without a hitch.  I have a condition which has required ongoing attention and treatment for the last couple of years.  I cannot praise Dr Bajwa enough.  He is meticulous, attentive, experienced and professional.  I have complete confidence in him.  When you trust your eyes and sight to someone, you want to know that they have the highest standards.  The Empire Eye and Laser Center fit the bill!<//Text>< pics>

<Review>Referred by local optometrist.  Came into an optometrist office which is more like a fast food chain for quickie botox and laser treatments. Very disappointed by this referral. This is not a real optometrist office. This is more like a botox, eye lid lift pop up shop. If you have eye care related issues, not just superficial desires this is not the practice to go see.

Long story shortened. The spealist we saw, simply wrote an additional referral to a different clinic. Staff explained to us that they are an eye clinic but that they do no specilize in eye surgery???? I am very frustrated having spent $175.00 for a consultation with a specialist,  to simply be referred to another specialist. Definitely not the way I wanted to spend my family's money during a surging pandemic.< /Review>< pics>

I have dealt with Empire and Laser Center for multiple types of tests and procedures. I find them to be extremely efficient, professional with a great success record in each of my visits.
They are very well staffed and the employees are friendly and helpful, and seem happy working there.They schedule effectively & efficently so that I haven't had to wait for any of my appointments.
The physician's are top notch in their fields and spend time with their patients (with me) in each visit explaining thoroughly whatever issue, procedure or treatment that is being done.
I've been very impressed.</Review>

< review>
Overall, I had a very good experience with Empire Eye and Laser Center.
I had cataract surgery on both eyes. All facets of my treatment and care were first class. There was lots of testing both before and after surgery.
Dr. Daniel Chang is a skilled I surgeon.
I also saw Dr. Vin Dang for other eye issues (dry eye)and I have an equally high regard for him and his abilities.
I am extremely happy with the results and I think we in Bakersfield are extremely fortunate to have this state of the art eye clinic in our community. They are top notch!<//review>

It was a great experience from start to finish. My 4 year old daughter needed glasses and I couldn’t have asked for more. The front desk was attentive as soon as we walked in. The staff were really understanding of her age and fear of drops in her eyes. Dr. Kao was great at explaining everything to my daughter and was patient with her exam.< /review>

I have been going to ophthalmologists since I was in college.  I am now 69.  I want to personally thank Dr. D. Chang and Dr. Dang.  They both have helped my dry eye conditions utilizing their great expertise and additionally great care and concern.  Thanks to these men my eyes feel better- I haven’t had eye comfort like this for 30 years.   Also the staff has treated  me with care and concern. I highly recommend Empire Eye.   We are lucky to have this level of care in Bakersfield .</text>

I was very impressed with Empire Eye and Laser center! I saw Dr. Dang who was pleasant, extremely knowledgeable, considerate and kind and answered all of my questions. The office itself is very sophisticated and runs like a well oiled machine. A very nice woman took my info, examined my vision and dilated my eyes. Then I moved into the next room where I saw Dr. Dang who thoroughly looked at my eyes. Afterwards I was shown to the last checkout desk where I was able to pay my co payment and was given a detailed printout of everything we talked about and instructions on when to return if my vision became worse etc. It was a smooth visit and would highly recommend this place to anyone. Actually the process should be implemented into all doctors offices. So many times the building itself is a confusing mess. It is evident that the building/process was thought out well. Thank you for a great visit!< /Text>

< Review>
I normally do not take time out to write reviews, but felt it was very appropriate to do so this time. I can honestly say that Empire Eye and Laser Center is top notch when it comes to advanced eye care in our area.
I have been struggling with dry eye for the past 5+ years and it was not until a recent visit to Dr. Dang at Empire Eye and Laser Center that I was finally able to experience some level of relief. From the time I stepped into the lobby, until the time the doctor performed a thorough assessment of my dry eye and performed my initial treatment, I was very impressed with the way the entire staff treated me. Not only is Dr. Dang at the top of his game as a dry eye specialist, but he was able to explain my issue in a way that was easy to comprehend.
I am SO grateful to have come across Dr. Dang, and if anyone finds themselves in a hopeless dry eye situation, I would highly recommend you take the time to visit him as well!</Review>

<review>Five stars is not enough to explain my experience.  What Dr Chang and his staff did for me cannot be paid for with any amount of money.  The especially kind treatment I received from everyone involved with me made me feeling special and cared for.  Especially Dr Chang and Dr Obodu the anesthesiologist.
I have stage 4 liver failure awaiting a transplant and found myself to be totally blind with cataracts.  Severe in both eyes.  I wanted my eyes fixed so bad so I could see while awaiting my transplant if I was to be fortunate enough to get one.  This meant I would have to undergo the surgery without anesthesia because of the damage it would further cause to my liver.  They walked it through with me kindly and tenderly making me feel safe.  When my first surgery was complete and the bright light was pulled away I saw for the first time in over two years.  The first thing I saw being wide awake because of no anesthesia was Dr Obodo’s big smile with his hand on my arm.  My emotions overcame me a little and he grabbed my hand with that big hand and with his big smile and kindness in his eyes and said congratulations.  Dr Chang has the most steady and reassuring way I have ever seen in a doctor, and with my situation I have seen many.  I could go on and on with the details of my pleasant experience but the same treatment and caring way flows throughout the entire office.  It is rare to find people who really care, even the ones in the background like Erin Bliss.  Thank you Erin for all your help as well.
So in conclusion, don’t even look at the price or the waiting period (they have no cancellations understandably).  It is worth much more.  If I receive my transplant and extend my life or don’t, I am happy and satisfied with my symphony lenses and my 20/15 vision.  Thank you Thank you Thank you.  I will refer everyone I know!</review><rating>5</rating><user>113465640789586680100</user>< time>

<Review>Dr Chang is awesome! I almost don’t want to say that because it’s hard enough to get in to see him already. Been getting Botox and filler from him for years! He’s so honest about what you need. I never feel it’s about the money with him. Sometimes he sends me home and does nothing and sometimes he does very little. There are times he says I need more. I totally trust him. He’s always right.  After all these years when I saw him yesterday we decided I should wait a couple more months for my filler. I just got Botox and I questioned that decision when I was leaving. But.... when I woke up this morning and looked in the mirror I realized he was right again. So happy with him😊😊😊 👍</Review>< name>

<review>Sorry to say, but our experience was that the atmosphere is about cramming as many people as possible in.
We were in the waiting area and discovered several people had been waiting 2 to 2 1/2 hours to get seen.
The first time we went, it was a nearly 3 hour ordeal.
Then, they wanted us to go next door to the other department to have my wife’s eye measured for contact to cover her eye.
It seems the dollar overpowers genuine care.
We let our doctor that referred us know, she referred us to Dr. Stainer, which placed the contact without measuring.
Empire wants to perform different procedures for more money, not solutions.
My wife’s eye is almost fully healed, thanks to Dr. Stainer!</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80ea4207fb5e72b9:0x41902274315fe066</gmap_id></record>

Excellent, prompt, professional and very courteous staff. Start to finish, I was in and out of my appointment in 35 minutes. I highly recommend this establishment to anyone looking for eye care.< /Review>

Empire Eye & Laser has a very professional staff and all of the latest technology in eye care. All exam rooms are equipped with iMac monitors for the standard distance eye exam and the rooms are kept in pristine condition. Dr. Chang is always enthusiastic and although seems to be rushed still treats you with genuine concern. Wait times can be a little long during peak hours but if you show up 15 mins early you generally will be in an exam room within 5 mins of your scheduled appointment.</review>

<text>Beware the price they quote you will possibly be much higher two months after your surgery if they don't like how much insurance pays them. The quote they give you is a bad estimate.  Two months later they want $700.00 more.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>
{'time': 1517610667929, 'text': "Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your situation.  Our policy when providing a cost estimate, is to do our best to quote an amount as close to the final out of pocket as possible with the information given by a patient's insurance plan, unfortunately, there are variables with each individuals' insurance plan that we are unable to attribute.

<rating>5< /rating><Review>I have my business executive suite at the Bixby Executive Center in this building. Also, my son's pediatrician, Optum, is in this building too. I always park easily here. The office building is easily accessible and wheelchair accessible.  The building is clean and professional/corporate.  The two elevators always work and are clean and nice. I like going to this building. Access the building parking from the north on Atlantic or you can go around the back off of San Antonio. You cannot make a left coming from the south on Atlantic. Highly recommend.<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<Review>The building is a poorly constructed, minimally maintained dump !

The business I go to in the building is first class, but the building truly scares me.
I have built many buildings, this one is scary cheaply made. Elevators are a joke. Most times one of two are not working.
Clearly, the owners won't pay to have the elevators truly fixed or upgraded. Just bandaid fixes.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Loved it. Despite a scheduling error they worked us in for the day I wanted. Customer service on point. The treatment I got was the signature honey dip. It was delightful. Followed by a pedicure. I WILL be back to try different spa treatments. Thanks for a great experience.< /Text>

OMG is all I can say!  My first facial and it was absolutely amazing!  My esthetician Star gets 100 stars!  Thank you so much!  They also have a lot of organic and plant based products so you’re not putting harsh chemicals on your skin.  I can’t say thank you enough.  Where have you guys been all my life!??!!<//review>

<review>I would visit the spa frequently pre-covid.  They are open now with restrictions.  I had their signature Honey Dip.  Amazing treatment that leaves your skin feeling as smooth as silk.  I miss the sauna and steam room being available, but I understood that in today's world they need to take precautions.<//review></record>

I love my EBJ visits for facials, the Himalayan Salt Glow, the signature Honey Dip, and my newest obsession with the Korean Body Scrub! Each time I visit, I'm greeted warmly, and I feel valued. The service is consistently strong, and the facility is impeccably clean. The retail section always has quality items that grab my eye, too. I'm glad to have made the investment in myself for the monthly membership!</Review>

This establishment is absolutely beautiful from the moment you walk in you're greeted by front desk staff. You receive a nice foot soak before your service if you're getting a massage. The massage therapists are very qualified and in the healing arts of Massage Therapy. I highly recommend this place if you're just looking for some relaxation, to get away with your significant other or day out with the girls.<//review>

<Text>I’ve been going to Vivienne for over a year for a Brazilian Wax and she’s amazing. Always does a great job.  I’ve never left and felt unsatisfied.  She’s friendly and professional too.  It obviously is a painful thing to do, but she is fast enough it seems to go by quickly.  Highly recommend her.< /Text><Time>1577163080069<//Time></record>

Chloe is great.  She does wonders on my face. Only problem I had was other clients. I was waiting in the salon area and a woman across from me,  said "you people can afford services here." I responded, clearly. I come in as close to my appointment as possible, if not a couple minutes late. Unwilling to make myself available for ignorance and stupidity.<//review>

<Text>I love this place. They are straight forward, friendly, and always reliable. I've been getting Brazilians here for years now, and they always honor my discount card. And while I had one esthetician for over a year, I've had two or three new ones since then, and they have all been wonderful and experienced. I will keep coming back here because I can count on the quality of service here.< /Text>< pictures>

Long time customer here.  This place has the good w/the bad.  Bad: turn over in staff more then I would like.  Being that the working being done is a Brazilian not to happy with everybody seeing my GOODS . Another bad thing is that they WILL NOT give long term customer the current/sales price (groupon).  Good thing: rooms are nice and they go all out on the type of wax used LOVE.  But bring that I have gave this company 2 new / now long time customer plus ME you would this taken $7 off my wax job would be easy but NOPE it asked more then once.</Text>

Randomly picked this place while in Chinatown and very glad I did! The Mongolian Beef and Pork Fried Rice were both excellent and very big portions! I definitely had leftovers for a  late night post-bar snack. The owner is nice and made my food very quickly, definitely recommend.< /Text>

<review>It’s really a humble place. I think the owner is the chef and the waiter plus the bus boy and the host.

We ordered frog and ribs and veggie. It was alright. Frog a bit old due to frozen. And rib on clay pot traditional. Veggie soso. What can you say? Dinner during Covid. I just glad he’s open and work on his own! Really! A 80 year old to 90 year old. Stand strong. And his shop is so old.

Make sure you sign on EndCCP.com to stop the communist regime to spread more virus. And practice FalunDafa.org to increase your immune system. A little bit recommendation here.< /review><time>1618637413358<//time></record>

<Review>The food itslef was not so bad, but the customer service was awful. Quick, disordered and chaotic. The final price on the bill changed twice and when I asked about the toilet, the lady walked with me to the door and showed me a public toilet in a park nearby adding "yes, good, thank you, thank you". Bad experience.</Review>< user>

This is one of the hidden gems in SF China Town.  Small and clean with great service. I saw only one person serving but he was quick and nice. Most importantly, the food was great too for the price you paid. Just like many small Chinese restaurants here, this store only accepted cash. Highly recommend.< /Review>

Cash only! So make sure you have cash before coming in. There were 7 of us and it seems as if the guy there is the only person working there so, dang! Food came out surprisingly fast and was tasty.   Just like most places in San Francisco, there is no toilet. The guy was friendly and even though a little hard to understand English we did well enough.< /Review>

<text>This owner is truly a champ. Single guy handles all the front and back business, and maintains it pretty well. Food (clay pot and wonton) came out quickly and was delicious. I did notice another customer was late in getting her change, but outside of that, definitely worth a try.</text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

We found this amazing restaurant, while exploring chinatown this past week. Little did we know that it was truly a great experience eating at this veune. Food was absolutely wonderful and the guy who runs this place does it all by him self, we had great fast service from this place and he's a very kind man. We will definitely come back to his restaurant in the future.< /review>

Can't put my finger on it but I find myself coming back here. I first stumbled upon this place 2 years ago when I decided to order wonton noodle soup to-go. I was expecting much, especially since it was take-out but it was actually pretty good. I have a high standards for wontons and dumplings and must admit it's pretty good. Found myself back here again a few weeks ago. I could have went to Hon's, which is my go-to spot for wontons but I wanted to give this place a shot dining in. Wonton noodle soup was what I ordered. Noodles had a great bite to it, better then most places I've been to. Wontons were on point with strong pork and cabbage flavor. Quite different than Hon's but I can see myself preferring this occasionally. Broth was a bit salty but nothing special.< /review>

Lot of hidden fees. They charge extra $1 for every tiny cup of tea/water even if you have spent $40 on meal. Moreover, they billed us 25% tips without asking us. There is basically no service,  we didn't understand what are the tips for? Horrible place, will never go there again.<//review>

It's pretty hard to make bad Chinese food, but this place manages to pull it off. I rarely post a bad review but the service here was poor to mediocre and the food was overpriced for what is basically the cheapest and lowest quality Chinese. The brocolli beef was ok (just ok), but the chow Mein was terrible. The meat was seriously questionable: chicken was rubbery and the pork was dry and old. We just ate the noodles and avoided the meat entirely. I gave this place two stars because the food was basically edible, but it was still far from enjoyable.<//review>

<text>(Translated by Google) It is surprising that this restaurant is operated by only one man. Although this is not very friendly to say, it does not let you sit in the place you want and brings you the bill without asking (it is running you despite the place is empty). The food is the best there is in the heart of Chinatown, and I don't say it in a good way since the food out there disappoints a bit. It is a bit expensive for what is received but as I say, everything is done by a man, only one.

(Original)
Es sorprendente que este restaurante esté operado por un solo hombre. Aunque este no sea muy amigable que se diga, no te deja sentarte en el lugar que deseas y te trae la cuenta sin que se la pidas (osea que te esta corriendo a pesar de que el local esté vacío). La comida es de lo mejor que hay en el corazón de Chinatown, y no lo digo de buena manera ya que la comida por ahí decepciona un poco. Es un poco cara para lo que se recibe pero como digo, todo lo lleva a cabo un hombre, uno solo.</text>< pictures>

However, there are many parking spots on the road. The trail was pretty crowded. The view was amazing through out the entire walk. There were also many wild flowers.</Review><gmap_id>0x80dbf941ee6d43f1:0x1892974c8944850c< /gmap_id>< Date>

Beautiful place for a walk, a bike ride, picnic and just to relax and admire nature.  Parking hit or miss, it fills up pretty fast.</text>

Great trail for beginners. There are many benches along the way. The total loop is 5 miles. There is a paved walk way the whole way so you can easily ride a bike or roller blade or even drive a car. The view is great and perfect for family even with kids. There are plenty parking spaces or you can just drive along. Highly recommended !!!</Text>

Paved trail throughout. Definitely well-trafficked. I got here at 7:30 am on a Saturday and just about managed to find a spot to park. Recommend going clockwise so you can get the shaded areas later. It does get tiring if you plan to jog the whole way, I probably ended walking 1/3 of the route. Keep to the right, get water and sunscreen. Get here early. Chances are, you won't find parking space after 8 am.
Good place to go kayaking or hop onto small boats and fish.<//text>

Calm and windy place in Mira Mesa with beautiful views of San Diego. There's a five mile asphalt road surrounding the lake which can be traversed by foot, bike or car at 10 mph. There's also a dirt road to hike around if you prefer. Rental bikes are also available.The water is clean blue with flocks of ducks, geese and seagulls everywhere. Overall a great place to come and relax or take a walk.</text>

Very nice and pleasant. Great for running, road biking or walking (5 mile(?) loop). The road around the lake is open to traffic. However, barely anyone drives around it and no one on foot or bike expects traffic. Therefore, not recommended unless disabled (or loves getting to dirty looks). Is is free, too :)</text>

Paved 5 mile round loop around pretty lake. Lots of ducks and other birds. You can rent a Kayak. Fish for Rainbow Trout and Crappie. No waterfowl hunting here, but it's more of a place to hike, ride beach bikes or recreational bikes. Dog friendly, if on leash. Good place for moms to take jogging or average strollers. Lower trails around lake to jog in less crowded setting, but be cautious on weekdays. Not so crowded, and some weird people seen on that lower trail. Usually peaceful on weekdays, but again, bring your dog if you're a female hiking alone, on lower trails.  Avoid weekends if you can't tolerate crowds. And you hate random cars driving on the bike, jogging and walking trail around lake.< /Text>

Pretty views, lots of people out and about exercising, good for walks, bikes and dogs.  Just know that it's busy a lot of the time and there are the occasional cars that drive half way around the lake.<//Text>

<text>This is often called Scripps lake. Though I prefer Miramar. It is a very tranquil place to visit there are paths all around the reservoir however be sure that you check the hours of operation before going. Vehicles can go approximately 3/4 of the way around the reservoir however the road ends at a picnic grounds perfect for family or special occasions. Be careful to watch your speed as there are many pedestrians with children. Also, kids will love to feed the ducks near the ramp just as you approach the lake from the entrance road. So bring your old bread and crackers.</text>< date>

Absolutely gorgeous lake! My wife and I decided to do the famous 5 mile walk/run and you had the option to either do it within the nature trail or the cement road. Both options are great whether you’re a runner or just a nature lover. Highly recommend visiting here and taking your dogs and family.< /review>

Came here for a walk with our dog. Heads up, a trip around the lake turned out to be 5 miles long, twice what it looks like. It's all asphalt all around, pretty good for rollerblading. Good view and overall a great place.</review>

Really lovely place for a walk around the lake, especially for those pushing a baby stroller. Paved path/road or dirt on the low path, two options give a different experience.
(est 2 hours)
Bathrooms & picnic tables on site, not much else.< /review>

It’s open at Sun rise and closed at Sunset.

Tip- There is a natural trail along the lake instead of the paved one; I liked it the most.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dbf941ee6d43f1:0x1892974c8944850c< /Gmap_id></record>

Great place for running or walking. Trail is mainly flat all the way around the lake except for a few slight grades. Be sure to visit Lake View Park at the east end for the views -- you can access that park via some unmarked dirt trails.< /text>

The park ranger is extremely rude. Acted like I was a criminal asked me multiple times if I had a warrant out for my arrest... I work at a bank.  and told me not to speak. Beautiful location but once I find the name of the ranger I will post another review and I’m contacting the people that run the lake to file a complaint</text>

Awesome place for stretching your legs or getting your outdoors time in. Great for wetting a line or cruising around the lake in a boat. Parking lot could be better as far as space goes. Just get here early to score good parking. Highly recommended for children to unwind or burn energy. Lots of birds and ducks to feed< /Text>

This is a wonderful Lake. The walking bike trail all the way around the lakeis very nice and it also has picnic benches halfway through where you can stop and have a picnic dogs can go on a leash bathrooms were clean and you had an abundance of parking I would definitely recommend you can also fish here.</Review>

Fishing wss good around the lake but not for me. Access is good for all, walking around lake. And fishing, four docks to fish from or fish from shore. Boat rental and complete tackle and fresh or frozen bait. Overall great.< /Text>

We live close by. Don't know if management changed but can't take the kids to play because TO MUCH DOG POO!!! it's everywhere. People are not picking them up. I guess there ignorant and park or management isn't either. Would have gave a 5 star if wasn't for the lake so dirty.<//text>

It's a great place to get exercise and chill after work, but ignorant dog owners leave their dog's waste all around the lake.. It's truly disgusting! I mean come on people, there are plastic bags for it right there at the office, how low can you go?< /Text>

Great spot for strollers as we wanted an area to take a leisurely walk and push our daughter around.

Many porta potties that are well maintained around the lake.

There is a snack bar that sells vittles for / after your trip around the lake.

Parking is plentiful. Unless it’s a major holiday, there isn’t an issue.

If you want to have a picnic, plenty of tables available near the parking lot or you can drive around the lake (10MPH speed limit) and use one of their picnic areas. I believe they are designated on the map.

Would recommend comfortable walking shoes. There are quite a few cyclists so make sure to follow the path rules of staying to the right, passing on left!<//text>

Great 5 mile paved path around the lake. Be cautious if riding your bike, there are many inconsiderate large groups of walkers that take up the entire roadway and are clueless to move over< /text>

Want to lose 3 lbs in 1 week?  Then come here at Lake Miramar and walk 5 miles for 5 days.

I don't think I will ever get tired of this place.  Lake Miramar is by far, my all time and number 1 favorite trail.  This is where I think about my whole life, past, present, and future.

First mile = The hardest one.  Why?  Because I still have 4 more miles to go.  It takes me about 1 hour and 45 minutes to walk the whole trail.  Yea, I know....Slow walker.

Second mile = I start to think about going home because I if I turn around now, that would still be 4 miles.  not bad right?

Third mile = Thank goodness, I didn't turn around.  I'm starting to feel motivated and I only have 2 more miles to go.

Fourth mile = I'm starting to feel that I can do this every day.  Maybe I can do sit ups, girly push ups, and knee ups after this.

Fifth mile = Yea...I'm not going to do push up, girly push ups, and knee ups.  I'm just going straight home because my legs are done and I'm starving.

See ya!< /Text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Text>(Translated by Google) Although it is a sewage treatment plant, there are large-mouth bass cultivation sites, and there are celebrities who catch big-mouth bass here. Anglers who love big-mouth bass can also try their skills, but please take care of ecological conservation Rubbish.

雖然是汙水處理廠但是有大嘴鱸魚的養植地，還有世界名人在此釣大嘴鱸魚，喜愛釣大嘴鱸魚的釣友也可以來試試身手，但請愛惜生態保育勿亂丟垃圾。< /Text><resp>None<//resp>< Time>

<text>Lovely owners! Called for a vihuela and they gave me options for the budget I was looking for (very affordable for handmade in Mexico) and shipped it across the country for me promptly! The package was securely wrapped and they even threw in a pack of strings for me. Thank you for the beautiful instrument!</text>< Gmap_id>

The owners are genuinely trying to help their customers on finding the right instrument for them. I've bought multiple instrument's at an outstanding price! Others are often amazed by the sound of my instrument's and ask where I bought them, so refer them back to U.S. Music! The best music store I've been to!!!< /Review>< Time>

<Resp>{'time': 1579291534243, 'text': "We have very economical guitars as well as better quality guitars, but I do not agree that we are over-priced. We sell takamine for example, at the lowest advertised price that we are allowed and we sell other more economical guitars at very low prices. Where else can you get a reliable acoustic electric 12 string guitar, for example, for less than $145 with warranty? we ARE LOW PRICED. :) I would like to know what guitar and why you deemed it over-priced so I could either refute it or get it priced correctly, if that's called for- maybe we had one priced wrong; it can happen."}</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2cdb90221c1a1:0x62c561810b435598</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Updating my review from a few years ago.

I went into this store with my son. He was very curious about the instruments bit didn't touch a single one, I was warned for some reason to not let him touch anything. They didn't want to offer help in me looking for an instrument or anything I needed I went into this store once and a very nice man helped with what I was looking for but this visit was very sour with the couple behind the counter to stuck up to help me</text><Resp>{'time': 1523134026397, 'text': "No idea what this is about. We are the only ones that work here.\nIt is not our intention to EVER offend a customer, or even non-customers, for that matter.\nIf a curious child starts treating guitars roughly, then we are going to intervene. We make our living with the instruments in this store. We can't let people mistreat them because we fear a bad google review. We do not want to offend anyone, but we also don't want our instruments mishandled. If we warned you to not let your son touch anything, then there was a reason for it. Toddlers and music instruments--- not a good combination."}</Resp><userid>112962394230344230412< /userid>< rate>

This place is wonderful. Depending on your situation they charge either $25 or $50 a night, and in super special situations it's free of charge. A shuttle to and from the hospital is provided every 15 minutes 24/7. But you can't just go in and get a room, UC Davis sets up the reservations. There are 4 shared kitchens, each room has its own mini fridge and cabinet in assigned kitchen to store your own food. They have some items in Each kitchen laid out for people to eat if they aren't able to bring/afford there own room. Each room has it own bathroom though, those aren't shared. Laundry facility provided. no smoking on property, must walk off property to have a cigarette. Free parking for guests. This place is a blessing for families in need that have a loved on at uc Davis.< /text>

<review>I'll always and forever be so grateful to ALL of the staff at Kiwanis. Charlie, is and always will be a guardian angel. Having a place to stay while going through challenging medical times and knowing they will not turn ANYONE away as long as rooms are available regardless of ability to pay is Yelly a blessing.

I owe these guys so much! My first stay with them (8/2013) was 36 days while my very high risk daughter had her baby. We had to stay for 1 month ahead of delivery and up to 2 weeks post delivery. At $50 per night it was a challenge but again thanks to Charlie and 2 other resources the way was provided to help us and ease the financial stress of maintaining basically 2 homes.

They came too my aid again several times. Some were just for a night or two. Again this blessed organization and the display of humanity is something I'll forever be grateful for.</review>< pics>

Nice enough place when you need a place to crash when your loved one is in the Hospital.  Staff is really friendly and helpful. Shuttles to and from the hospital so helps with saving money at the parking garage at the hospital. Cheaper than a motel room for sure. Rooms are clean and tidy and you have your own bathroom.<//text>

<text>This is a great place to stay. My wife has surgery last week and we had to stay there after her surgery for a week. The employees were all very nice. The rooms are nice. The beds are the worst thing there. They are very worn out and it was hard to sleep and my wife had a hard time. So if you stay there keep that in mind. The kitchen and dinning area were nice. The court yard was also nice and a good place to get some fresh air and relax. The common area/ living room area was also very nice. The couch was a nice place to relax and read a book. Target and Save Mart are a few stores that are near by. They are not walking distance. If the beds were better I would have given 5 stars.< /text>< rating>

Kiwanis Family House provides a critical service to families from out of town who need to stay close to their loved ones who are receiving care at Shriners Children's Hospital or UC Davis Medical Center. Lovely facility with great staff and volunteers!!</Review>

My dad had cancer surgery at UC Davis and we had exhausted our resources. We were offered to stay at Kiwanis Family House so my brother and I did. The facilities were clean and we were allowed food and refrigerator storage as well as there being community food, coffee ect. It was a godsend.< /text>

<text>This is great place. Staff is friendly.  Everybody staying here has someone in the hospital or there while going to appointments at the hospital. 24/7 transportation to and from the hospital. I could go on and on about this place. It's fabulous.<//text>< pics>

<review>I could not even begin to say enough about this place.. Absolutely,some of the nicest people you will ever meet work here,they treated my wife and I like family..We were about to sleep in our car,I mean it,we were in back of a building at about 5:00am,just about to make a little bed in the back of our little SUV when we got a call saying we could have a room for a few hours to get some sleep.. That turned into a couple of days,free of charge 😁. Now it's not usually like that,so don't expect it. Anyway,we really love this place and the staff!<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This house is amazing. It's $50 a night but you can do payments whenever you can. Bedrooms are clean and usually have DVD player. You get your own fridge and cabinet are in case you wanna buy foods and prepare them there. Also there's food items the Kiwanis provides for everybody at no cost. There's a laundry room for a small fee and they provide the detergent. Overall great place. Very thankful!< /Text>< resp>

I have been attending the hiring process for California sleep solutions who operate out of the Kiwanis Family House. The rooms are comfortable with their own bathrooms. Decent amount of parking but you need a permit or a good reason to be parked in the sleep labs parking. If you think you have any sleep disorders, speak to your physician and he may recommend that you do a overnight sleep test in a place like this.< /Review>

<text>Charlie , Dan and their staff are truly amazing people. I'm blessed to have had such caring people around me. My son was at UC Davis with terminal cancer. They went out of their busy schedule to accommodate me in any way they could. Always asked if there was anything they could do to help. I'm from Indiana not knowing anyone. They made my stay as comforting as possible. Bless them all!</text>< Pics>

<text>Absolutely most amazing people ever run this place. If it weren't for them my husband and oldest son wouldn't have been able to be by my side most of the time I was hospitalized while pregnant. They made sure that even though we didn't have much money at the time to spare that my husband and son still had a place to sleep and food to eat and paid them what we could afford when we could afford it. Then when my son was born 3 months prematurely they gave me a place to rest and refuel while I was in between trying to get an hour of sleep and sitting by his crib side in the UC Davis NICU. Super friendly staff that go out of their way to make sure your ok because they know if your staying there than more than likely your carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders, and there they are trying to take some of the pressure off if and when they can.</text>< Pics>

<Text>This place,I don't even know how to begin,it is unbelievable.The people that work there are soo nice,they really do go out of their way to make sure everything is just right for you ..it's a real nice place to stay,If you happen to stay there remember that without us and donations the place wouldn't be possible. My wife and I didn't get to Sacramento(UC Davis)until about 1:30 am and we stayed with our daughter till around 5:30am , we were actually parked in the back of a building,getting ready to make our little bed in the back of our SUV when a nurse called and told us to get to the Kiwanis house and we could get a few hours to sleep,well they ended up losing us stay for 3-4 days and we were treated like family. Kiwanis house is my first choice now,and we will definitely be returning a few more times before this is over..< /Text>< pictures>

<text>So very thankful for this wonderful home away from home. My husband had surgery closeby and it was a lifesaver for us. It has a kitchen with everything one would need, including some food! The staff was very helpful and kind. They had a shuttle to the hospital and i felt very safe. Lots of others had stayed many days or frequently for monthly chemo. I'm sure it was an even greater relief for them, as the time and cost quickly add up with a lengthy illness.<//text>< name>

<Review>Nice place great staff. I stayed in an R/V space for 3 weeks to recover somewhat from AML till the Dr said I could go home :)
They have a R/V shower that in my opinion needs to be stocked and cleaned twice a day 👁👁 but I guess once is the standard
Great place though ❤️< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x809ad0763e6f1295:0x696fb031d1128a0a<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The sweetest staff. Pretty good set up. Your own room with 2 beds and stand up shower. You'll also get your own small fridge and cabinets in shared kitchen. It is self maintained so be aware everyone's habits aren't the same even tho it's for sick people so you'd expect**people to be clean. This is for sick, under funded people needing services at various hospitals in the area. They work with you. Has a beautiful patio and 2 different tv rooms and a play room for children. Great place with great people. Blessing< /Review>

I have been staying at KFH for the better part of a month now. The people there are so wonderful and helpful. The rooms are super clean and they provide everything you could possibly need. They really have helped me out of binds when needing a place to stay while my daughter has been at UC Davis. Thank you KFH!<//Text>

Good place for people to stay while having procedures done at u.c. Davis. Nice, clean, but I think it's a little expensive. Especially for patients that have the travelling expenses too.</review>

<Review>This is a wonderful place that allows families of a UCDAVIS patient to stay overnight for as long as you need for a small donation. Sliding scale goes by income and what you can afford. Wonderful friendly staff, very clean rooms, entertainment rooms, bathrooms, kitchens. They assign you a refridgerater and you can prepare / cook in the kitchen ( fully stocked). Small tv in each room. A bus shuttle to and from UC DAVIS hospital so you don't have to pay parking each day. Very convient. Approximately 3.  miles to the hospital.< /Review>< user_name>

<Resp>None< /Resp><text>The Kiwanis Family House (KFH) is similar to the more familiar and nearby Ronald McDonald House. The two big differences are: 1) KFH is for the families of UC Davis patients who live more than 35 miles away from the hospital, not just for the families of children--but any aged patient; and 2) the KFH was founded and continues to be supported by the efforts of regional Kiwanis Club members. The Kiwanis Clubs support the site both monetarily and through service projects. As a more grass-roots option, KFH doesn't have all the bells and whistles of McD's, but they do have what stressed-out families need: a safe place to sleep, eat, and park their vehicles.
Before a guest can stay at KFH, they must be referred by the hospital to KFH. Ask the charge nurse of your floor for help with that. Availability is first-come, first-served, and there are no guarantees. When my aunt and uncle visited, they had to stay in a hotel for 2 nights, but KFH was able to provide them a room for the next 3 nights. The rooms are not free, but they are usually less expensive than nearby hotels. Prices may vary, so check with the charge nurse for the current rates.
Check-in was a bit slow, and they ask a lot more questions than a hotel does, and there are more rules you have to agree to. Nothing terrible, but they want you to treat the place well since it's a community-supported special place. They give you a tour of the facility, pointing out the common areas, your personal refrigerator, the common groceries you can share, the lounges and game room, the places to park, the shuttle stop that takes you to the hospital at no charge, and the free-Internet.
I haven't stayed there myself, but I've helped family and friends settle in there on three different occasions. They all felt the place was a nice haven from the stress, and they appreciated being so close to the hospital. Their only complaint (and they all said the same thing) was that the mattresses made it feel like they were sleeping atop a blimp, where it was rubbery, curvy, and like they would roll off if they weren't careful. My 6'+ uncles both said the beds were also too short for their tall frames to stretch out without their feet falling off the end of the bed. The bathrooms were small, but private and adequate.
There also are RV/camping spaces out back, so if you prefer camping, that is an option, too.
I would give this place a 4.5 star rating if I could, but since I can't, I rounded up to 5 stars. The half-star deduction would mainly be for the beds, the difficulty getting reservations (because there is more need than their limited facilities can provide), and the lengthy check-in process. But all the benefits and the caring nature of the staff are why I rounded up instead of down.<//text><user_name>Will Murray (Willscrlt)</user_name>< gmapID>

(Translated by Google) Due to my son's accident, we spent a time in Kiwanis, where we received support and help with a lot of love and love from the staff who work there, we will never be able to thank and return everything we received.
Thank you for the great work you do.

Debido al accidente de mi hijo, pasamos una temporada en Kiwanis, donde recibimos apoyo y ayuda con mucho cariño y amor del personal que trabaja allí, nunca podremos agradecer y devolver todo lo recibido.
Gracias por la gran labor que realizáis.<//text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>Service was terrible. Asked for salmon 4 times before finally being told they were out. I understand if y’all are out of something but like let me know. The waiter rarely came by our table, and there were long periods where we didn’t have meat on our grill and no server around to order more. We were sitting outside. At one point I got up and went to the car to get my water bottle because the server hadn’t been by to refill waters or check in on us. Server saw me coming back from the car with a water bottle and said nothing. Had to quickly call out as they were rushing by to get their attention, then they acted like we were being a bother. If you can’t properly serve the outdoor dining area, don’t have it open. There was a young man with a ponytail that came back and checked on us. He wasn’t our server yet provided better service.</text>< Pictures>

<Review>Everything is good except them seems don’t want to offer vegetables. We ordered many times, they just gave us meats. Is vegetable more expensive? I really don’t understand.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpo4HogbSNS13c2_W9WK32YNrlKnxezfFF8zDB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDRRn28m4q3edOwIRbds1S9TFzPcpgBkbeqULx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< response>

<text>This was my first time here and I enjoyed the selection of meats and seasonings.  The waitress didn't clearly explain fully how things are ordered or what other things were available.  The amount of food for the money was a good value for the amount of food we ate.  Saying that, if you come with a big appetite you will truly enjoy your experience.  I'll be back, but this time I'll plan my course of eating a little more strategically.<//text><GmapID>0x808e32801309e837:0xa4283b7a6d090e5f</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Overall experience was good. Food was great, service was good. The music could be more user friendly (not so explicit) but we’ll be back for sure<//text>

Food was good. The tables for 2 are small and they expect you to fit the grill, bonchon, plate of meats and the hotpot bowl if you added that. Drinks are party cup size and no refills so it's 1.50 each drink. I wouldn't have minded since I'm glad I can even do kbbq but the service was ridiculously slow. Being seated next to the entrance and having servers pass by every couple of minutes you would think they might stop by and ask if you needed anything. Especially if 15 min have passed and you clearly have no meats left to grill or eat. I spent more time drinking my drink than eating it seemed like. The outdoor model doesn't work like it does indoors where the kitchen is near by and service is fast. I will not be returning until indoor service is available again. The spicy pork belly and the galbi short ribs were my favorite. The premium steak looked like dried dog treats. I didn't get to try any seafood since they forgot it on our second round of meats. I left after that.</text>

<resp>None</resp><text>Service is lacking. Had to ask several times for lettuce to wrap. Music is louder than the servers so it’s hard to hear them through the masks. They only let you order 3 or 4 meats at a time. We ordered more then that and they took a few away. When we asked for the stuff they took back, the server asked what was brought out the first time. So we have to go back to the iPad to look up the order. Then he can back with a dish we already ordered. Took forever to pick up my check too.

Not an enjoyable experience. The more I eat out here in SJ.... the more I just want to stay home.< /text>< Gmap_id>

<review>Absolutely worse customer service experience in my last five years. If you want to actually get to eat something without getting pushed out the door before you even sit down I suggest you get here at least four hours before they close. I came at about 8:15 on a Friday night and I was told wait time was about 45 minutes so I decided it would be fine after waiting an hour and fifteen minutes we were told via text that our table was ready. At 9:32 we were told our table was ready. When we arrived at the host stand the hostess told us sorry we do last call at 9:30 then another hostess came and told us we would be able to get a table however and actually get to eat. At this point the whole experience was just distasteful.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x808e32801309e837:0xa4283b7a6d090e5f</gmap_id></record>

Service is trash , came in during lunch wasn't busy at all. Server rarely came by the table and when she did didn't even bother to check in. Waited 30 minutes before getting another refill of water and it was room temperature no ice. Waited about 20 minutes for our bill after requesting it twice. Noticed how our server would check in on her other tables regularly and was friendly to them but not our table , might low key be a race thing considering we weren't asian. Definitely not worth the price don't bother with this place when other bbq places like gen bbq have way better service even during rush hours.<//review>

This is an all you can eat restaurant. It has both bbq and hot pot. You can choose only bbq or both bbq and hot pot. BBQ has chicken, pork, beef, seafood. Hot pot has many vegetable, red, lamp, pork, chicken and seafood. The seafood was fresh which has large oyster, large mussel, fish, clam. The pork belly was nice taste. They have 2 hr eating time restriction. And they use Tablet to order food which is easy and quick. Great place for Korean BBQ.</text>

However plan ahead for dinner times, wait list times can range from 1-2 hours.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x808e32801309e837:0xa4283b7a6d090e5f< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Was not worth the 70$ for two. Service was a 2 star and the meat quality was about a 3.5. We were told the wait was 30-40 minutes instead waited an 1 hour 15 min. After we were seated our meat came out before our grill as we just sat there for another 20 minutes waiting. Over all with about 40 minutes of eating we spent about 2.5 hours just waiting for food, butane, and our grill. Surprisingly the fastest thing we received was our check.<//Text>

Don’t come here during Covid. Originally from LA so I know what good KBBQ is. San Jose’s standard still remains exceptionally low. The meat quality is not that great. They gave us hot pot meat for KBBQ. What the heck? Service is also horrible. Missing items, having to repeatedly ask for food, etc. Seated on a cheap bench with no heater nearby. Only one server for 10 tables. Super long wait times for bad food and service. Avoid!<//Review>

Love Korean BBQ. Went during Covid and they have a bunch of tents set up in the parking lot and sidewalk...plenty of tables. The food is great and keeps on coming until you can't eat anymore. Service is very friendly and quite fast. Food and drinks came quick despite the outdoor setup. Will definitely be back. Be sure to try to spice beef and pork bulgogi!< /Review>

Loved all the sauces and they had cucumber kimchi which is one of my favorite banchan. The brisket, steak, and pork collar were my favorite meats and you can ask for lettuce to wrap it in. Most of meats are thicker cuts. They played EDM (Porter, Illenium, Kaskade, etc) and had a fantastic night ambiance. Our server Jason had an abundance of full tables, but he still gave us quick and friendly service. Our grill did momentarily catch fire in the water trap, but the workers noticed and remedied it with haste. I've eaten at plenty of All You Can Eat Korean places with my boyfriend when we miss having dinner with our family (I'm half and he's full Korean) and this place definitely is one of the better ones we've been to.<//review>

<Text>Tried this place yesterday and loved it. We did the Korean BBQ and Hot Pot Combo at lunch time and it was $19.99. Great price for the variety and the amount of food we ate! Service was wonderful. It’s a touch screen self ordering  system, but the waiter explained it really well to us, checked on us several times, people came to take plates away whenever they saw empty plates, and the food came quickly after we ordered. I loved that I had my own hot pot and my boyfriend had his own. You can also adjust the warmer settings yourself. I definitely recommend this place and wish I discovered it sooner!< /Text><Rating>5<//Rating><Name>Sarah C.<//Name>< gmapID>

The first round was pretty good, even better than expected!
For the second round, I ask for red wine pork belly and spicy octopus.

The anticipation is high, the wind carries the delicious smells of cooked meat. 20 minutes later, the second round hasn't arrived, but I'm patient, the food will be worth it!

After 30 minutes, a different server brings the check, so I guess it's time to go?

After the check was taken away, the first server comes back and I tell him the food never arrived. There was no second round of meat, only a half full stomach and disappointment</Text>

It's an all you can eat Korean bbq restaurant where you cook your own food on a grill on the table. Great variety of meats and vegetables, as well as seafood.  You can also have the several types of broth as add on.
The quality of the meat is good and it's a must if you like meat. We had a variety of different beef and seafood options.
The staff was friendly and helpful and the whole experience was good, I recommend it.< /Text>

This is like a double, we get the Korean BBQ and the hot pot at the same time, ain't that a deal now, service could be a little quicker, but we can give that a pass, it being a busy Sunday, but good fun, good food, all you can eat, what more can I ask for.<//Text>

Who doesn't love all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ. this place also gives you the option to add a soup hot pot for an additional $3. But because of weather was warm we opted just for the regular Korean BBQ. We got here about 6:30 and the place was just having people trickle in. By 7 it was pretty packed in here.

So this place you order your dishes by touch screen. You're allowed to order for dishes at a time. So we ordered for and submitted it and some dishes came. Then we ordered some more if you more dishes came. The kitchen was very slow about getting our food out.  and we kept ordering more more food though it didn't seem like much was coming out of the kitchen. Since it was all-you-can-eat we weren't really worried about starving but I had a feeling that not all our food actually came out to our table.  The things we really liked was the marinated short ribs, the red wine marinated pork belly, and and the any of the thinly sliced beef that we ordered. We sat there and ate for almost two hours. We never felt rush and we didn't over eat either.

we got plenty of attention from the serving staff as they were constantly checking up on us and bringing food. Whenever our grill even gotto the point where anything was slightly sticking they would come and change it.

There is a caution sign about parking in the lot and that people should not leave valuables in the car or insight because there have been numerous break-ins.<//text>

<review>Q Pot I have mix reviews. We tried it because its suppose to be coming to our area. We paid for both Korean Bbq and the Hot Pot. The Hot Pot was really good the broth was great and they had a variety of items. Now the Korean  BBQ they need to work on that. I dont really report anything negative and really  it was not that bad but compared to what we have our Korean BBQ is really good. Would I go back yes for the Hot Pot. Also the server we she was so nice and helpful. 3💜</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOE2LsOJ5Fwe9qVQLqnwVKogVOLJEcN-3ZiyQjj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPq27wEknQbNN9XEXIUvQ6FxSYkLOoVcMUuUP30=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPDga2tP7u8emIBnW1MtPCMicEKbkZ9NPl1tr4r=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvkJS6u_iCbgMQbE8BA8J7zPFHwVv6BZKYvspf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOiRNBOdaTg5Su8CbfjO_cQOm6qzbjEb5bVUWVw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOPZc-xp4nlWReBfdV-FFsbVOXXbAzPgmJPndI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUsluQtQaJz8C1HREB-mqqmuBAAmSNCJSgj9mT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-oZZJs3aXOXvNvdf_B6Rv5fHxt3Gk4gwmJf4K=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMaPcyuPeVgk2-RvZKyLKggmTlZgYaJYXKA0iO-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhN4tRHMRDyfGj_yfmuW4HGXqmPDmZCQBhAllQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPb0L2DukDJS4Ve_mkw8XUsL--n-Xa6T4aDgUQf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqvlFHm9Oyh01OtxJNJcO9evBgSUkKTjdVDduE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Was actually pretty disappointed. Night started off great but just went downhill from there. The Pros: service was good at the get go, they were quick to bring up dishes, they constantly changed our grill in the beginning (maybe even a tad too much). The Bad: Meat quality was not as good as other places (think cartilage, excess fat, or tough cuts), portion sizes were too large (a problem because some of the items just aren't good and you're stuck trying to finish them when all you wanted was to try it), they became completely inattentive after we passed our first hour of eating, their ordering pad was faulty, and they really do stick to their two hour eating limit to a tee and were pretty blunt about it. Most places will use the two hour time limit as a guideline and generally exercise more finesse when it comes time to gently remind you to wrap up. Here they hand you the bill 25 minutes before your time is up and tell you you're almost out of time. No last call for orders, drink refills, or offers to get anything. If two hours sounds adequate, you'll quickly realize it isn't since they seem to count even the time it takes you to sit down, learn how to use their ordering system, and not to mention there's a line for the sauces. We realistically got about 80 minutes of eating time. Add to this the time it takes to grill meats and you'll quickly realize two hours isn't really adequate to actually have a good time. When we got the bill, we were also charged $26.99 for dinner instead of the advertised $25.99 price. +$3 for hot pot person but I thought it was worthwhile since I liked the hot pot more. In terms of selection of meats and veggies, they don't offer as much as other places though we did like that they had oysters which was different and the highlight of our bbq. Recommend coming here for lunch first to see if you like it. Dinner doesn't seem worthwhile to me.<//Text>

<text>Total fan of this hot pot and Korean bbq together in one. It’s $3 more to do both... so do it!! You do the Korean bbq for the meats and flavors and you do the hot pot for the veggies. The hot pot broth- I got the spicy Taiwanese was not spicy nor had good flavors. It was overly sweet. They have a diy suave bar, so luckily you can add spice or more flavorings. The meats were good. The veggies were good. The service was good too!< /text></record></dataset><record>

Outdoor dining review: Expect a wait for everything. The servers are overwhelmed and understaffed. Management should better support their wait staff with trolleys to help with the load of dishes since the walk is anything but short with their new outdoor set up. Or they should've not bought so many tables for seating as their staff cannot handle the amount of customers that their new set up offers - this was obvious as my group arrived to many available tables but it it took 30 minutes to be seated.

Menu is on paper which is discarded after use so there's no reusing of those. Most beef items are raw and grill-able. Other items are cooked in their kitchen and brought out to you ready to eat. You could also put those on the grill to adjust doneness to your liking - like I like pork belly to be on the golden, crispier side.

Not a great ayce kbbq experience as many of my items were never brought out/had to ask several times for the same thing. My group ended up leaving after 2 hours feeling unsatisfied as we kept waiting and not getting any service. However, I sympathize with the servers as they are ill equipped, overwhelmed, understaffed, and don't have the support they need to keep things running smoothly. Hopefully the management will better provide for their staff. I understand they want to keep up with customer demand (for outdoor dining) but I rather they take care of their staff, the essential workers, that are serving us.< /Text>

BUT it was some of the worst service. We didn't get our rice we asked for until we were almost done eating. Refills on water same issue. Most of food came out pre cooked and was overdone. Plus it cost more.

Overall I would say a skip.<//Text>< Pictures>

The service at this restaurant was pretty good, and they do have unlimited rice as well! They were also very accommodating with having the children split the cost between the unlimited rice. It is a great place for groups because they have long tables. You also get to eat on real banana leaves! I strongly recommend this place.< /review>

Had to ask our waiter 4 times to get us our drinks and didn't get them until we were almost ready to leave!  Requested a clean meat cutter and was ignored.  Demanded to see the manager and was passed on to a new waiter.

The fried who recommended this place owes me $120 dollars for pointing me to this dump!</Review>< user_name>

This is the place to go but sign in on yelp before you go and check in when you get there or the wait will be long. No matter how long you wait, it is well worth it. The food is delicious and the variety is very good. The price is amazing. I am here visiting from Florida and was very happy with Q Pot. Be prepared though to wait to be seated and while the servers are very friendly, they are very busy.< /text>

<Text>Terrible past few experiences. Getting seated isn't the issue you have to worry about sitting down with your food in front of you but not utensils to cook or eat, you have to wait 1hr and a half just to get six orders of food in but still pay 66 bucks at the end of the night. I came here 6 times since the opening since the pandemic because I love the food (only reason it's not 1 star) but have got the end of the stick service 5/6 times and my last experience made me quit supporting. I'm understanding of the pandemic and the situation it's caused but when your server prioritizes other tables while you've been waiting to cook the food that's been sitting in front of you for 10 minutes I'm throwing in the flag.</Text>< userid>

<Review>Amazing food! We took the hotpot and I just loved it.
However, there are two tips I can give you: the waiting line is huge (we waited two hours as they were 66 parties in front of us at 5.30pm!!) so try to sign up through help instead.
And second, the hotpot is cheaper at lunchtime (17pp instead of 27 at night) whereas the Korean BBQ is always 27.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Around 6:45 pm though, it starts to get REALLY crowded; plan to arrive a little early if you don't want to line up. Ordering from the touchscreen is a REALLY nice concept; we liked the convenience of ordering at our leisure and seeing what we're buying. Orders were quick to come as well. Unfortunately, I would say that other places have better seasoning for the meats. Whether it was seafood, chicken, beef, or pork, the seasoning that accompanied them was overbearing and a little on the "sweetish" side. This came as a surprise, as other KBBQ restaurants were able to find a balance. I would suggest ordering the dishes without seasoning, but then the food would be too bland in my opinion. Staff were nice and attentive. Service was quick. I would not come here again though.< /text><Rate>2< /Rate>< gmapID>

<text>Was not at all impressed. Very expensive for the amount of food given. Need to cook your own food on a gas hotplate outside and the soup I ordered was a HUGE portion, but the smell of it completely took my appetite far far away. I would only recommend this place if you want to try something new, but not if you are actually hungry.< /text><user>110623263395241796616<//user>< pics>

<review>That is my absolute favourite location for KBBQ and Hot Pot on earth!  You get the best of both worlds and although costs are a high each cent you pay is well worth it.  There's a massive choice of sauces to select from, and of course that the real soup and meats toppings to select from also.  I have been here at least 8-10 days and that I do not think I have gone through the Complete menu nonetheless:'(< /review><Rating>5</Rating></record></dataset><record>
<review>i love MEAT. so this was gr8. i would recommend it if you want to have lots of time with your friends. but sit away from the cooking thing in the middle so that other people cook for you and all you gotta do is eat the food. that’s definitely the best way. also they have touch screen ordering things ?!?!?!! so high tech, so 21st century. wow, a dream.</review>< name>

<Review>Absolutely loved this place. I've been to other Korean bbq places around the area but this one is by far the best. I really enjoyed the taiwanese spicy soup! Our server was great, very attentive even though it was extremely busy (1 hr wait). It was a little bit tight for seating in our table, but as soon as the food came I forgot about it. It's a little bit on the expensive side, but it's all you can eat, definitely worth your money.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFtexkARGs6xqB68y1Dpt-w1Jaw7xXNHucvHwZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x808e32801309e837:0xa4283b7a6d090e5f<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Bad customer service. Manager is extremely rude, the worst part is, he has no

This is one of our usual spots for kbbq and as a bonus, they also serve hotpot too. They have a variety of great soups and broth for hotpot but my personal favorite is the mushroom soup. The lunch menu is much smaller than the dinner menu, but it's still good for the price. Pork cheek and chadol are on the lunch menu and really, that's all I need. But they serve, sea food, Korean starter dishes and bonchon. Complimentary sauce bar and you order through a tablet. The staff is pretty quick to help you however you need it. Overall, great place if you like AYCE kbbq and hotpot.</review>

Good quality food, nice portions, and our orders arrived at our table pretty quickly. There were a couple of hiccups with getting our grills started at first, but that's the first time people in my party had had that issue, and they'd been there several times. I will say that they should ensure that their servers are equipped with longer lighters, and not pocket lighters. I felt really bad for the guys trying to get our grills going, as they kept nearly burning themselves trying to light the flames. Very attentive staff, though. I'd definitely return, if invited to do so.</Review>

<Review>I don't know if I'm the best resource, since I'm somewhat new to hot pot.  That being said, I've been here several times with a woman who has done hot pot on the regular.  So, with that caveat in mind...

Great place I can't recommend enough.  Nice people, quick service, and a good selection.  Best part is you can get in "line" online!

Two thumbs up!</Review>< time>

Excellent cheese corn and spicy chicken. Surprise shellfish in the soft Tofu soup/hotpot base so that wasn't great; wish that had been mentioned in the item description. Watch out for this one if you have a shellfish allergy.< /Text>

<Text>Food is good. It's nothing spectacular, but I enjoyed it.

I really liked being able to order things from a tablet. I didn't find out until the end of my meal that there was able to use a help option on the tablet to call your waiter.

The service was great. I felt bad because I came with a party of 20, so our server was probably overloaded.< /Text></record>

First time here, great for groups. I love all the food. Went for a birthday had fun and got to taste alot. I suggest to go with the broth pot or the regular meal both together is too much. You end up getting full om the soup.</Text>

Always use their online wait list, faster plus it tells you when you should arrive by. Excellent service, always busy. You will be cooking your food so if your not into that then this isn't the place for you. Went to dinner no hot pot with our meal. Cost with tip approximately 80. It all depends on what you order.</Review>

We ordered two different items for lunch for take away. We were given the same thing. And the chicken was cold (not even warm) and did not taste well. 40-50 bucks for two people.< /Review>

This is not a place you should go solo.  It was my first time as Yelp gave it high ratings.  They seated me in a large booth area (no spots for singles) and I am sure that could be troublesome as my potential is lower than what a group can bring.  I let the server know that it was my first time and she seemed preoccupied as I needed help to explain what to expect.  I am not a fan of cooking my own food and paying for it so I missed that one.  I asked another server who was very helpful to explain some basics and give me his favorite spices to use.  I ordered the popcorn chicken and BBQ beef.  Both were below average on quality of meat.

For those that work there, if you have a new customer, explain the process and maybe suggest a signature dish.  Turn up the heat a bit as well.<//review>

We had the seafood soup and also BBQ  (pork belly, bulgogi beef, premium steak, short ribs and don't remember what else).
The wait time  to be seated was around 10 minutes(very good considering the high amount of people waiting to be seated).
I will go back and bring friends.< /Text><Rating>5</Rating>< pics>

Quality and portions are good. The last time I went, their app was down so they had to do the ordering by writing stuff down. Despite this, orders still arrived promptly.< /Text>

Whenever I fly down to San Jose from San diego. Been to so many kbbq spots in SD. This place is legit. Service has always been fast and the fact you can make your own sauce. Some San Diego place needs to do that.<//Review>

This is the one place we also come with friends or family gathering. Wide selection of vegetable and meats cooked on table top by yourself both ways either BBQ or hotpot style. And wide selection on beers is icing in the cake. Highly recommended.<//Text>

I really like Korean BBQ and this place is definitely worth checking out. It's service is what stands out the most for me. The staff is friendly and attentive. They also do a great job of explaining their ordering system. They staff is also very fast! You never wait over an hour for a table, which is pretty common in other Korean BBQ places. The food is good. It's not the best meat I've tried at a Korean BBQ place but for the price it is very much worth it. I definitely recommend this place.</text>

<Review>Usually when I dine at Q Pot, I have a great experience but since the pandemic started, I haven't visited since I live out of town. Just the other day my friends and I came to Q Pot and the experience was terrible. Yes we dined outside and all the dinerware was one time use. Paper plates/bowls, wooden chopsticks, plastic cups, and dipping sauce cups. We came here for the all you can eat KBBQ but I assume one of the servers heard me wrong and thought I said that we were finished after 2 rounds of food. We sat waiting for another server for 30 minutes and when they came, they handed us our bill and left without saying a word. No one asked if we needed anything else or if we were actually finished.The server who gave us the bill didn't even say "thanks" or "have a good night". Usually there's a tablet at the table to order food but we had to wait for the servers to come to us. This was a huge let down. This is the second time we have had a bad experience here. The first time was when the servers purposely gave us a bad stove which could have led to a fire hazard because one side of the burner was not lit but the other side had a huge flame and kept burning our food. Adjusting the knob did nothing to lower the flame.<//Review>< Rate>

My advice would be to skip all meals for no less than 3 days and drink a minimum amount of water. Once you use the wall mounted iPad ordering device to get.your first 33 ages of meat and side dishes you cant pronounce nor honestly care too because your mouth won't be able to naturally close to chew your food...you'll know you're going to get your money's worth each time they come over to switch out the grill cover for a fresh clean one to start your marinate and flavors all over again. The staff here are potential mind readers in my opinion or they play poker and can read your eyes when you think you've had enough and they appear from nowhere with another plate of meat you know you can't eat but sweet Jesus this is America and can't spell KWIT!!!< /review>

<Review>Just had a wonderful evening here with friends and my first time here. The restaurant was very well lit up from the outside and full of people which always looks good. They got us seated and processed our initial food and drinks order lightening fast.
The food was absolutely delicious , ordered a spicy salmon, rib meat , steak and ice tea raspberry. Music playing and loads of food with plenty of drink refills. Really looking forward to my next visit!.< /Review>< Pics>

My only complaint is the wait times, so I highly suggest making sure you have something to do before going here. It can range between 20-60mins of waiting. But other than that, the food selection is top tier. You have your option of hot pot as well. The price is steep, but it's well worth it. Just make sure you have a decent sized group. This place not meant for people to dine alone.</Text>

The two stars are for the food. It's not very helpful when the server tells you "I don't usually work the weekends" and when you ask what's on the milk broth simply responds with "I don't know, milk?" . If you also ask us if we are new, it'd would be great to know you have a full sauce bar before we are more than 75% through the meal as well.< /Text>

This is a place u must go if your a korean bbq lover.  But when its semi busy they might forget to serve u timely.  We waited 25min and watched patiently people who came after us got serve before us.  We finally waive the waiters attention to serve us.  Once they notice they did become more attentive.  But by then we were so hungry we ate and even grilled all our little side dishes they give you as you sit.  I did put down a good 18% tip but hesitated a bit.  I will try agian and see if they have improved.< /review>

<Rate>4< /Rate><text>Classic foods with a highly trained team. iPads for ordering directly from the kitchen at every table was welcome. Be prepared to make your own dipping sauce at a communal salad bar like station. It's a fun way to get you even more involved with the food your grilling yourself. The place had an overall clean feel to it, even though my tables iPad was a little busted up. The tables here are also user-friendly and interactive, you can adjust your own temperatures on the Hot Pot grills. On the main Grill I think the server's all have control over it at the end of your table to regulate temperature. The servers do seem, by necessity, to be a little over present in order to make sure you're using all the (more than likely) unfamiliar equipment correctly. It feels a little baby sitterish at times. I had the dessert ice cream. It's a large macaron ice cream sandwich. The macaron taste seems to get in the way of the flavor of whatever ice cream you were getting a bit. But it's an overall good treat. And it also seemed like the correct choice of dessert after all the foods and flavors that came before it. I ordered the hot pot and the normal meal, and was very satisfied, I enjoyed myself a lot. I will probably be back.<//text>< Pictures>

Restauraunts like this are definitely worth trying.

Depending on when you'd like to go (lunch is obviously cheaper, so before 3pm), it can get pretty pricey.

I absolutely loved my server as he helped me with every damn thing on the menu, helped me with cooking and even made me a dip ! Outstanding service.

BBQ and food was amazing, definitely worth the price, dinner or lunch.

The hot pot, may be a personal preference, but I didn't enjoy the hot pot all that much.

Aside from that, would definitely recommend.

Very Delicious, the hot pot burned my tongue last year and still raw. Cannot eat spicy foods, which I usually love. Didn't look to be boiling, but it was. Be cautious.</Review>

Took my friend here for her birthday we waited for about an hour to get a table, good choices of food but it's a bit expensive and too bad you can't take any of the leftover food you already paid for.< /review>

I came to Q Pot a while back with my brother as we were both craving Korean bbq and too lazy to drive all the way to Gen! I had seen this place pop up a while back and was I told this place was decent. Although I feel that the quality of the meat here is not as high as some other places I have been to, they do provide pretty much all the main meats you would want when eating All you can eat kbbq. When I go for AYCE I usually stick to meats and was able to try the bulgogi, premium chador, pie belly and other meats and seafood. As usual after eating I felt I couldn't move but was happy with what I had eaten.

I would give this place a shot if you were craving Korean bbq and wanted to get some fast and close by (assuming your are in evergreen).<//text>

Many reviews will say, oh the price, oh the portion,  oh but the parking or service, blah. Many of these types of places have waiters who are literally running to be able to help, secondly hey if there is no parking it must be good so be patient and wait. Good food is always worth the wait! I am a fatty though lol< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<review>The atmosphere is very nice. Very opened and well lighted. You can actually see what you're eating. Pretty neat concept of both hot pot and BBQ all you can eat style. The workers are so nice, helpful, and full of energy. Our next girls night out will definitely be at Q Pot.😋😋🍜🍲<//review><Name>Thuy Huynh</Name>< GmapID>

<Response>None</Response><text>My friend was celebrating a belated birthday and we decided to take him out to lunch here. This was a nice little new restaurant that opened up recently and we all wanted to try it out.

We came in right when it opened up for lunch and there was no wait at all. They sat us down promptly and she showed us the ordering process.

She said it was still soft opening so they took care of us on the hot pot.

There were still some glitches in the ordering system through the touch screen at the table, but most of the food came relative fast. Some of the food didn't come at all and we had to call over our waiter so she would check the back.

Overall, we enjoyed the Korean BBQ and hot pot. The meats were tasty and the price was very good for lunch.</text><gmapID>0x808e32801309e837:0xa4283b7a6d090e5f< /gmapID><UserId.>113905663818584450678</UserId.><Date>1468545183077</Date>< Rate>

Ordered five plates for pick up. When I get there I noticed the bill was larger than usual. Turns out they changed their price WITHOUT updating their website to reflect it. Refused to give a discount or refund. Not coming here again.</text>

This place is awesome. I love being able to cook my own food, and I especially love the hot pot. The selection of food stuffs is great and the sauce bar is excellent. The staff is very friendly and attentive with out being over bearing. Although the wait is sometimes a little annoying it is usually well worth it.< /Review>

<text>The wait is a little long.  Even though there are empty tables, we still had to wait over thirty minutes!  I'll update after we get the food.  But so far, the decor is very modern and complimentary.

The tables all have center cooking tops that you cook your food on.  The staff is relatively attentive.  But not extremely coordinated.</text>< Pics>

Had to try this place!  So my friend and I went during lunch time. The wait was a bit but not too bad. The price was well worth it considering the amount of food and the variety! Enjoyed the fact that we could have both Korean BBQ and Hot pot at the same time!  The server was Jerome, nice and friendly, was on top of his game, but the food could have come out faster. Maybe because it was lunch time it takes longer? 2 hours definitely went by fast! Would definitely go back again with an appetite!</Review>

<text>Pretty good place if you're craving hot pot and kbbq.

Similar to same quality of meats but I think you have more variety when it comes to choices like tofu, seafood, mushrooms, and other veggies.

Compared to Gen, this place you can order your own dishes on the pad rather waiting for your waiter.< /text><Gmap_id>0x808e32801309e837:0xa4283b7a6d090e5f<//Gmap_id>< user>

<Review>The ultimate experience of Hot Pot and KBBQ, all in one! On top of that, you don't need to wave at someone to place your order because you order for a touch screen pad at your table, YESSSSS! Did I mention there is a make-your-own-sauce bar??? Amazing! Pro tip: You can wait list your party via Yelp so you don't have to be that "person" waiting at the door to be seated! :)<//Review><username>Annie< /username><response>None<//response>< Rating>

Excellent service and food. Been there many times but this time I have complaint. My hostess was rude and dismissive. I was shocked because most of the time service is excellent. The reason I'm still giving this 5 stars is because when I told the manager about what happened she promptly corrected everything, moved me to another table and gave me a waiter that was EXCELLENT! She took my dissatisfaction seriously which made up for the chupidness of her employee. I can honestly say I will go back for more yummy soup. Highly recommended.<//text>

<Time>1485904490247</Time><Rating>4<//Rating><Text>Great food at a fairly reasonable price. I love both hot pot and Korean BBQ, so to get both for under $20 is amazing. They do have a charge ($5 I believe) for food waste and I'm taking 1 star off for the fact that they charged me ($12.95) for all 3 of my kids, who are 1, 3 and 5 the last time I went. The first time, they only charged me for 1 child. Seriously, how much could my 1 year old have eaten??? Anyway... worth checking out, but leave the little kids at home.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<text>The food was absolutely amazing definitely enjoyed it. A few issues getting our table came a few minutes after the text saying our table was ready and they told us they gave it to another party. A bit frustrating, but it was sorted out eventually at least. It can get really busy, but the staff does a good job of keeping up with the tables to the best of the ability. Highly recommend trying it out!</text>< Pics>

I would have to say Gen is WAY better. This place was more expensive then I thought it was going to be. Went there with my family of 8 (husband and I plus our 6 children) and my MIL and or bill ended up being well over $300. They only had chop sticks or plastic forks to chose from and the food we were ordering didnt come out either correct or at all. At Gen it's half price for kids at a certain age, and here they don't go by age. They go by how big the kids are...wierd. I don't think I'll go here again.< /text>

This restaurant gets 3 stars because the soap dispenser in the female bathroom was out. I gathered soap in my hand from men's batheoom to put it in my female friend hand so could wash her hands.
I would have given an another star but i disagree fundamentally with the hotpot "all or nothing" option. Hint hint. So 4 stars if you were to change said system.

Honestly, it's one of the closest k bbq places in san jose outside of gen Milpitas. Its actually good quality food, decent service and seems to be improving everytime i go.  Would and do recommend.</Text>

Love grilling and hotpot. I prefer grilling here then at Gen despite a smaller selection. 4 star because service is hit or miss and the floor can get really slippery at times due to oil.</Review>

This place is delicious.  Haven't done the hot pot yet but the all you can eat Korean BBQ is awesome.    Spicy Prk belly is amazing and the kimchi here is spot on.  Great group place.  Keep in mind you grill your own food can be dangerous with kids.< /Text>

Great food, the meats are all fresh, texture and sizes of the meat are great, the place is very ambient and welcoming. The only reason I give it a 4 it’s because the customer service was very slow, and I had to wait for about 20+ min to bring me and my friend our rice dish, other than that I recommend this place, only suggestion would be to have more staff on busy days like Friday evenings.</Review>

<Review>The food is delicious as always. They serve Korean BBQ as well as hot pot. There is a selection of alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks.  There's always a huge line, so remember to reserve ahead otherwise you will be waiting 30 mins - 1hr+ to get a table. You can reserve your spot on the waitlist through the Yelp! app and see how many people are in line before you</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x808e32801309e837:0xa4283b7a6d090e5f</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

BBQ is good, hot pot isn't. Order screen is useful but a hassle when items are in Korean without pictures. Also, orders still go to wrong tables despite the order screen supposedly streamlining the process. During one visit, a half hour passed before seeing a single item ordered from first batch of orders. Majority of my visits have gone smoothly though.< /Text>

The wait is completely worth it however with the sheer variety of hot pot selections and korean bbq options. Been there multiple times and I always had a wonderful experience.

<text>This place is good, ventillation is not very good though. With all the bbq going on, it sometimes feels suffocating...beef options are great, chicken marinate was great, however the fish marinate was really off putting and on the sweet side which won't go well with salmon...</text>< pictures>

This experience was a 5 because of our waiter, Francis. Him alone made it a 5. His recommendations were great and so was his interaction and engagement with us.

We will definitely be coming again especially since we just moved here from the Detroit area and it's our first sit down restaurant in San Jose.< /review>

Great service, pleasant and attentive.  Great steak and Kalbi.  Enjoyed it as wrapped in lettuce leaves dipped in ginger and miso paste.  We liked ordering food using the IPad without having to wave down the waiter.  Food came fast and the grill was frequently changed.  Will definitely come back.</Review>

I feel like the second time will be better because I'll be more familiar with the process and foods, but had a fun atmosphere, good selection of items, and very quite and attentable service.<//Review>< date>

Only offer service to groups of two-four people,  at least this is the impression you get when you ask the front. If you just want a pick up of Korean BBQ, look somewhere else. Good luck if you are a single order.< /Review>

<Text>Yummmmy! I am a lover of Korean BBQ ( the stuff you can cook on your own) and hot pot. If you dont know what this is...COME HERE TO TRY. Unlike some BBQ places, this one has sides and sauces to choose feom, AMD, you get to use your own iPad to order your food. No need to wait for the waiter! Love, love, love!!!!< /Text>< gmap_id>

<review>Food is alright. Nothing to jump up and down for.  It's always fun to grill your own meat over a hot grill. My problem is the ridiculous rules they have, like "you must order four items each time", "you will be charged for wasting food" and "you have a limit of two hours." And if you think all their rules sound cold and unwelcoming, you're right! And guess what? Orders are placed through a tablet computer. I guess that saves the owner from having to retrain their wait-staff because all they need do is bring stuff to the tables. But it also hurts them bad because they no longer have the human touch.< /review></record>

The food and ingredients are really really good. But having to cook your own food can get confusing if your not a Korean bbq expert and also adjusting the flame can be a hassle. Some people next to us burned their food because they had the flame up high.< /review>

Q Pot was pretty cool.  The look of the Restaurant, amenities like draft beers and being able to make reservations is very cool.   Our reservation was for 7 PM and we were promptly seated 7ish once everyone in our party arrived.   The beef, pork and oysters were very fresh.  There is a sauce and condiments station that can be a long wait depending how many people is in line.
It's about $30 for all you can eat grill and if you want all you can eat hot pot You have to add $3.
Their rule is, if 1 person orders both all you can eat grill and all you can eat hot pot, everyone at the table have to too.
There were 2 things I definitely did not like.  My daughter is 11 years old and weighs 69 lbs.  They charged her Full Price because they felt she was too tall.  WTF? Not age determined, but by an eye test that she is too tall so they have to charge her adult rate? What if she was shorter but chubby? Will they charge her FULL rate cause she too robust? The 2nd thing is, we had a party of 4 adults and 3 kids.  They charged Tipped us!  I use to be a server at Uno Pizzeria, we would charge tip on parties of 6 or more BUT never counted kids in that count.  My kids are 15, 13, and 11.  I always tip at least 20 percent so they cheated themselves.  Then there was the we have another party waiting when there were clearly other tables available on a Thursday.   Basically telling us to hurry up and leave cause your 2 hours is up.  That's just could be me though.  I felt, a 15 minute heads up would have been nice.  But again. That could just be me.< /text>

This restaurant exemplifies the best qualities of KBBQ: Ease of ordering through a tablet, multiple hot surfaces and partitions make deciding between hot pot and Korean BBQ a non-issue.</text>

Overall pretty good food and great if you want kbbq, hot pot, or both! They did seem a bit understaffed though. The tables were a bit sticky/dirty and it took a while for waters to get filled. There was also a few small issues which they will hopefully fix over time!< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x808e32801309e837:0xa4283b7a6d090e5f< /gmap_id></record>

I am a foodie and this place is a joke. I ate there today with 6 others . Food is crappy service is bad and if you don't pay attention to all the hidden cost you will be screwed. If one person at your table orders Hot pot the entire table is charged for hot pot even though the other folks did not order it. They just wanted BBQ. It was seven of us with a baby, we were charged for seven people but because we had a baby with us we were charged an 18% tip to have a newborn sit there and eat nothing. Close our bill out before we can order dessert and then inform me that they can run my card again. If you like quality food this is not the place food quality is poor price is not worth it.< /text>

All you can eat. Individual pots. Really delicious broths available to pick from, including 3 that are spicy. You control the heat through a remote hooked under the surface of the table. You order your meat/veggies/etc through a screen at the table, and the servers bring it out to you. There is a limit to how much you can order at a time, so you should pace yourselves! Try the Swi fish if you like seafood. Definitely get the fishball w/roe. Meats were fine, but they don't offer a large stack on each plate, so I felt like I ended up ordering a LOT of meat...? Went on a Saturday for dinner, and it got packed quickly...so make sure to arrive early! I got there at 5:30PM Otherwise, you can make a reservation online. The Google Maps page offers a link to reserve a table.<//text>< pictures>

<review>You have to cook all of your food. Only thing you don't have to cook is the rice. If I wanted to cook my own food I would have stayed home.

I was invited here by a friend and did not know the concept. I thought we were going out to eat at a normal restaurant. I like going out and relaxing not stressing about cooking.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Having bad experience from reception to host. I went there for diner on Thursday night. After waitlisted,  they called but since my party was not present. They immediately called other group. When my party is here, i ask if i can get a table. The receptionist gave me no specific answer and told me to wait. Their food selection is ok. Using ipad to order and yet miss one of our order. Their servers is helpful, but their management is bad.</Text>

Great friendly place to eat, lots of people and great customer service. Although I did felt like I was at a club with loud edm music going on but it's not too bad. I enjoyed everything about it. I only wish the other customers had more respect and drive alot more slowly outside of the restaurant. All I heard was car racing to go in and out of the lot.< /review>

Great all you can eat korean BBQ and hot pot.  If you go during lunch you have less meat options (17.99).  I prefer dinner so you can get the Korean short ribs (Galbi) forgot what other meat was missing.  It’s 25.99 for dinner plus an additional 10$ for both all you can eat bbq & hot pot.  They have a huge sauce bar and you cook the meat yourself.  Also make sure to ask them about signing up with the rewards program 😁!<//Text>

<Text>This place was amazing!! So different from the other Korean BBQ restaurants I've visted, the music was modern, good drinks, and fast service. This is the ONLY place I know that serves shrimp with no shell, oysters, and samon in the seafood section. They were very attentive to changing out the grills and the table kiosk was definitely the most convenient way to keep food coming. I do think they should add trays to carru your sauces since they're self serve and maybe some floor mats because it get pretty slippery. The other great thing was the Q pot served with the order, I haven't experienced another who offers both. The soup was great and came with some fresh veggies to add in.

I would definitely recommend friends, family and i will be returning. We were LITERALLY the last customers leaving and NEVER did they rush us and last but certainly not least, THE PRICE!! We paid like less than $100 for endless food, I love Q Pot. You have a new favorite customer.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

TL;DR - Henry M. is a phenomenal server. Beef bulgogi and marinated short ribs are 5/5.

Came in, seated promptly in a nice roomy booth. Was quickly greeted by Henry M. in a cool, collected manner, characteristic of a professional proud of his work. Easily someone who's been doing this for awhile, Henry hit every step of service with precision, sometimes in a manner where he got in and out of the table with our refills and requests  without any of us noticing. He even loaded up the first round on the hot plate for us. Best service I've ever received at this restaurant.

As for the food, it was grade A as usual. We ordered the marinated pork belly, spicy beef bulgogi, beef bulgogi, brisket, and premium steak. Ate these dishes with my own sauce made of 3 parts brisket, 1 part ponzu, 1/2 spicy chili sauce, garlic and green onions.

Marinated pork belly: Maybe a bit overcooked on our part, but wasn't brimming with flavor like other dishes. 3/5

Spicy beef bulgogi: Plenty of flavor and juiciness with this one, but definitely on the spicier side. 4/5

Beef bulgogi: great texture to soak up the personal sauce, marinated very well with tons of flavor. 5/5

Brisket: super thin, cooks in seconds. Got the job done. 3/5

Premium steak: juicy, good level of tenderness. Solid fat/meat ratio for a good amount of flavor without
being too fatty. 4/5<//text>

1 star. I have been here for 3 times. 2 times in 2017, and .1 time in 2018 Oct. Q-pot was good in 2017, the meat was good, the service was good. However, the service and food down grade a LOT in 2018.
I ordered 10 meats, and the waiter only give me 3 with very little meat per plate.
I asked the waiter to change grill because my grill is pretty burnt, the waiter refuse to change it and told me I can still use it for 10 more minute.
I ordered meat for shabushabu, the meat never got served. I had to ask the waiter for the meat, then it got served.
When we check out, we found the waiter put extra "coke" on our bill. I pointed out we never ordered coke. The female waiter said: "Oh, I am pretty sure you ordered". I said you can check the table, there is no coke. Then the female said:" Oh I am still pretty sure you ordered". Excuse me?
At last, 18% service fee was added to the bill. I wish I can give you 1 cent service fee for the very bad service.
I will never go there again. Never.

If you want good service, go to Haidilao in cupertino. Q-pot does not deserve the price.<//text>

<text>Favorite Korean bbq place in the area. I like the selection of meats, sauce/condiment counter, and service -- staff are happy to give recommendations! It costs $25-30pp AYCE depending on whether you order soup or not. Call ahead to see how long the wait is before you arrive.</text>< user>

Great all you can eat Korean BBQ! Hotpot is a little extra $ but worth trying if it's your first time. Make sure you have an appetite!</review>

The food here is really good. I must first star off by recommending that if you decide to come here on any given evening, especially on a weekend, get here early because parking will take a long time to obtain. Also, make reservations for large group as seating is also limited. I definitely like the digital order menu, it streamlines the ordering process. I also like the hot pot thing. Eating hot Korean BBQ and hot soup with shrimp, shrimp balls, tofu, miso, and all the goodies, and drinking the Soju. Even my Mexican friends love this place now! They also have non-spicy meats too. Price is a little upscale, but you get what you paid for here.<//text>

Great food and speedy service. Truthfully, having both hot pot with Korean BBQ and being all you can eat was overwhelming, but if it's your first time 3 dollars isn't much to spare for an experience.< /Review>

< Review>
Poor management.
On a memorial Monday lunch, after sitting down and finished ordering meal. While we were dining, the server came and told us that management had decided to change the price to a Regular FULL price for lunch.
Even the Ordering panel shown the lunch price of $40-, we ended up paying a $99.96 "Dinner Full" price.

I made a complaint to the manager Vince and he declined to correct the poor pricing mistake.

Beware of this establishment.< /Review>

<text>It's cold in there sometimes...so bring a jacket!

Good solid meat and fish options...their "make your own sauce" section is left to be desired for...I would say less sauce options and better quality would be smarter, in my opinion.</text>< Pictures>

A bit pricy, but the food is great. There is a sauce bar where you can get sauces or make combinations to have with your food. There are options for kbbq, hotpot or both. Everyone at the table has to eat the same (or both)  they have a tablet ordering system which makes getting additional food easy.</Text>

<Review>This was not my favorite place. It is extremely noisy inside and the restroom was a mess. The food was okay but not the best place I have been to. I joined my daughter and her boyfriend for dinner. They had the hot pot and I did not. Never did they tell us that they charge a whole table for hot pot if anyone orders it in addition to the Korean barbeque. Simple things like getting water refilled and checking on our table were not followed up on. We did get orders of meat delivered just fine. We left a tip for waitress who helped us. Several of the other waiters were taking shots of alcohol at another table with customers. It seemed really inappropriate to be drinking and serving on the job. We let management know. I will not be going back.</Review>< Name>

<Text>Friendly & fast service. Only order  Bulgogi. They don't have dipping sauces on the side for other types of meat.  Pork belly miso has no flavor & cut too thick.  Tom yum hotpot has good flavor.< /Text>< pictures>

Banchan: super pathetic. Plain, no flavor. They don’t even seem like they’re made in-house but from those tubs from costco =_= we only liked the spicy cucumber one but they were out already! (@5pm on a Sunday) lame
Meats: not high quality. SUPER FATTY. Flavor on the galbi was great but literally half of it was fat (see my pic!)
Teokbokki: omfg.. it must have been stewing in a pot for the whole day cuz the fish cake was mushy af and the sauce was watery which made it lack any flavor. I’ve had teokbokki from the freezer aisle that showed more effort than that.
Service was friendly, food came out quickly, tablet system was easy to use but food sucks.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

First time here with the family: grandparents, grandchildren and us. Enjoyed Hotpot and BBQ Grill all together. Miso and kimchi hot pots great with slices pork, soft tofu, bokchoy, lotus root, daikon and all types of mushrooms. BBQ was good with kalbi, premium steak, octopus, spicy bulgogi, shrimps. A really new experience of eating and ordering through a touch TV located at the table. Service was attentive. I will come again when in town and when extremely hungry.< /text>

<Review>Didn't think i would personally like it. But it has been one of our top go to places. Delicious soup that you customize with unlimited ingridients and add the bbq for even more food.<//Review></record>

I hope that people will not experience what happened to me herea yesterday. I experienced food poison after eating here for dinner.  It was pretty bad.  I had diarrhea and was vomiting at the same time until there's no more to expel.  I got so weak and started shaking and sweating.  I also had an excruciating tummy ache. It was the most 8 hrs traumatic experience entire of my life.< /text>

<text>I love that you can have both KBBQ and hotpot. However I'm more of a side dish eater so it would be great if they had more varieties of side dishes. So here, you put your order in a tablet and they bring it to you. Great if it work, bad if they didn't get the message because you can be sitting there waiting and you forget that you're waiting for a specific dish because there's food in front of you so you just keep on eating and by the time you remember, you're too full.

There's new ways order your foods direct from your table to kitchen,  I like that.  Then if you haven't been touch it is ok let's the manager returned it.
So far the best Korean BBQ in South San Jose.< /text>

<text>Delicious place for AYCE, though I only tried for the KBBQ and not hotpot. Simple intuitive touchscreen allows you to see and order what you would like but I have to admit, it's not a very responsive touch screen and the orders don't allows arrive the way you place them, ie: ordered two orders of galbi and oysters and only one order of each came out. Or even worse, placing an order and it never even showing up. I suppose it's not the biggest deal breaker since you could just ask the server or re-order said item but it's simply annoying. Service was great, fast, and friendly. Restroom was horrible, no soap 😑. Overall, I suppose I would come back if I were in the neighborhood but they would easily get 5 stars if they fixed the above issues!< /text>< user_name>

<text>Pretty neat and new Korean AYCE place. They have both bbq and hot pot so you have more to choose from compared to GEN. Moreover, the wait is much shorter. We were seated in less than 5 mins wait.
They can only seat you when everyone in the party has arrived. There are tables as well as bar seats. High chair is available for kids and you can order through their tablet, which is pretty high tech. The price is fair at $25 per person on weekends. Their seafood is a must order, especially the clams. Those are huge clams. Meat wise quality is lower than GEN but still not bad.
I took one star off because our server doesn't really know what's going on during our visit but our orders did come in a short time. Our orders do come fast enough.<//text>< Pics>

Light atmosphere. Service is fantastic and diligent. The food was delicious. I had the dinner schedule surprised it was all you can eat. Glad we came early too. Around 5pmish huge crowds were conjugating. All I can say is make sure you cook your meals right. Enjoy the fun side of light cooking. Oh the soup was awesome. I had herb cooked in shiitake. Mmmm<//review>

It's a suitable alternative from your usual kbbq experience, adding a slight difference in the addition of the optional hot pot.

The sauce bar and the convenience of ordering right at your table with a touchpad screen (though every so often it gets a little laggy and glitchy) is probably the best points of this place. While service used to be not as quick back then, whatever changes they've made have significantly improved how quickly your order comes out.</review>

< Review>
The hot pot and KBBQ concept seems cool, but doing both at the same time is overwhelming! You get distracted by all the different items that you don't really get the most of either option. While they offer a variety of meats and seafood, but the quality is mediocre to poor. The best item is the beef tongue so I'll give them that. The hot pot items are okay and they offered some unique items like spam, chinese sausage, and meat filled fish balls. The tom yum soup is really tasty and the taiwanese spicy was pretty good.

If you do plan on visiting, I recommend coming with no more than a party of 4. And do not come HANGRY!! All tables have ONE grill - even the tables that seat 8 people. Do you know how long it takes to cook enough meat to feed that many people?? We had a party of 7 and we probably spent more time waiting for the food to cook than eating it. Plus the ordering system is on one end of the table, so those sitting on the opposite end don't get to see the menu at all.  It is pretty to use, but you have wait 3 minutes before submitting a second order if you get premium items. This is fine, since you can't cook all the meat fast enough on one grill anyway.

Overall, this place is worth a try but not a place I'd frequent.< /Review>

< review>
Mixed Feelings about this restaurant.  Lets break it down.  The restaurant I've been told is only in its second month of operation but is STILL working out some kinks in service and its menu.

The concept is to combine a traditional Korean BBQ & Hot-Pot restaurants into one AYCE experience at your table together.  The service is a mix of traditional servers, people who seem to be running food, and self-ordering from a built-in tablet at the table.  The tablet seems to work pretty well, menus easy to navigate, and good visuals built in (part of the HINTS system).  The self-pay system isn't activated yet and they only accept 2 credit cards per table (so get ready to Venmo friends).  The food selection seems to be pretty good in variety for both hot pot & bbq; and some items we found you could use in both styles.  A self-serve dipping sauce bar was pretty awesome.  The restaurant visually was in great condition, sleek, modern, and with plenty of exhaust hoods.  The meats & veggies were pretty good; not the best I've had but not poor quality.

What I didn't enjoy:  No prices listed on website, in the restaurant, but word of mouth told us it was $25 for both AYCE; not until we waited, then sat did the server offer up that the price has now increased $28 (I believe) which isn't horrible but would be nice if you posted this and were transparent. With plenty of exhaust hoods it certainly didn't seem like ours was working at all; steam and smoke was definitely not going up ours but seemed to trail the next tables vent.  I've heard friends say it was too cold from theirs working.  So this doesn't seem consistent yet.  Ventilation in this style restaurant is highly important.    The service; while our server, Huy, was cheerful and happy guy, he didn't seem to be fast with getting items out to us or knowing where we were in terms of getting the items we ordered.  Pressing the 'help' button on the table didn't seem to equate to him coming over, more my eyes tracking him down worked better.  ICE in the summer; I've seen this as an issue on other reviews and we experienced it too; sorry no ice right now... and then none came later either.  If you split a check (which is most customers) be aware that the suggested tipping amount on the bottom of your customized bill is still the amounts for the full bill but not noted.  Adam the manager I spoke to about this acknowledge this after I called in; I don't think that is a wise and transparent practice.   Some items ordered in the system never came, some only came when we placed a second order into the system.  But by far the most frustrating is that it took 18 minutes for us to receive the lukewarm soup base which took 10 minutes to get to a boil; so 28 minutes in we could start eating.

Be aware its new and popular so you should expect a wait; we waited 1hr 10min; they estimated an hour so no points off for this; just helping you know the reality.  Should you wait?  If you want to try it out; hope they've worked through some things by then.  The food was okay, service needs improvement, their process needs a lot of improvement, and my conversation with the manager didn't seem to address much at all.  Good Luck!<//review>

<rate>1< /rate><Name>Samantha Silva<//Name><Review>Service really was a disappointment. When we were more then half way with eating our food, they brought our drinks. It takes a whole hour or more to get seats to sit down, and it wasn't even that busy,  according to them. When we got our meats, our little stove thing wasn't even on, so we waited another 15 minutes until someone came to turn it on for we could cook our food. Once they turn it on and we started to cook our food, it started smoking because they didn't put any water inside the small stove. Our food took forever to cook and the reason why was because the propane gas they gave us had very little gas.  We order rice bowls and extra condiments to go with our food , and took more then 40 mins for them to bring it. When we order more meats it took a very long time for them to bring it as well. There restroom was so dirty, right when I enter, I almost trew up because of how horrible it smelled and it was really dirty. Overall it was horrible service and I won't return there at all.  It might look nice and so cool to go there but I felt I wasted my money and time there.< /Review>< resp>

Food and meat quality is good. Good variety for both the bbq and hot pot.  Service is really nice but kinda slow.  But I feel that might be more that it was really busy and maybe not enough staff working.</Text>

(Translated by Google) This place is the best of Korean food, there is no one to compare it, ask Jason the waiter he will make you laugh and his work is impeccable. Give him a good tip.

<review>(Translated by Google) Very busy, but not delicious. . The meat was cut very thick, and the outside was not cooked. Each sauce is very sweet and the salmon is not fresh. The dish is very slow, and it’s not finished until the order is finished. The waiter is as slow as a waiter serving a whole city, especially bad. There is no price for the self-service order, and you know how much you have ordered. as well as. . Red wine pork tastes like bacon. . Only shrimp can be eaten. . In short. . Not recommended to go

(Original)
很繁忙，然而并不好吃。。肉切的特别厚，外面糊了里面还没熟。每种酱汁都巨甜，三文鱼不新鲜。上菜特别慢，点完单快吃完了还没上全。服务员慢的就好像一个服务生服务一整个城市的人一样，特别差。自助点单没有价格，结账才知道自己点了多少钱。以及。。红酒猪肉吃起来好像腊肉一样。。只有虾还可以吃。。总之。。并不建议去<//review><username>yunlong bei<//username><Rating>1</Rating>< userid>

忙碌！需要耐心等待。口感很不错，特别推荐 火锅和烧烤一起吃，朋友聚会会很有气氛。< /text><Rate>4<//Rate>< name>
