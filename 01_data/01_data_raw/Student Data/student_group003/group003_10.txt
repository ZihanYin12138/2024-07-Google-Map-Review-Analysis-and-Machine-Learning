<review>Don’t use these people, they will lie to you about how long they will take to give you service. No communication when they are late. I’m not sure how one finds a locksmith who doesn’t lie, but this isn’t it. Expensive too, $250 for a lock out< /review>< Pictures>

The locksmith who came to help was named Gal and he was fast and professional. They were here in 25 minutes!  Great service! They are very pricey though - $249 for a bottom lock to be opened for my apartment. A real steep price to pay for forgetting your keys. But what can ya do!</Text>

Called to see about repairing my broken car key. Guy was very short and condescending. He said it wouldn't be possible to fix the remote part of my car key...but would be able to create a new car key without my remote for $275. I thought that was too expensive. Might as well go to my dealership to pay $200 for a new key WITH a new remote.

Called another local locksmith. Very helpful. Sent a picture of my key. After they reviewed the damage...They confirmed they are able to repair BOTH the remote and key for $85.

I wouldn't recommend this place based on the pricing and rudness of the representative I spoke with.<//text>

Michael was thorough, punctual, and totally professional. He made an initial visit to assess the work and determine the needed materials. When he got the parts, he came back to try to to the installation. Everything was went consistent with plan. We highly recommend him work.</Review>

Broken key in lock, removed for $304. The serviceman did his job right, but the bill is way, way too expensive; did the same thing last year with another locksmith for $85. In response to the response below, last year, you fixed the whole mechanism of the lock plus changed the inside, it was totally more elaborate than taking out a key. We used a different locksmith three times with totally different pricing.< /review>

Michael is the beacon of professionalism. He is by far the best locksmith in all of Long Beach. His skill with his tools is only matched by the quickness by which he removes locks. If I have issues in the future and find myself in need, I will definitely contact 24 Hour Locksmith. He is by far the most reliable locksmith in Long Beach.<//Review>

We just bought a new place and I wanted to have the locks changed out for peace of mind. I called Michael and he came over the same day. He looked at the locks and said they just needed to be rekeyed (saving me $$). He took care of my deadbolt and door lock in about 30 minutes - everything is as good as new. Michael’s a professional and I recommend him and HS Locksmiths 100%!</text>

I lost the only key to my car and needed the services of HS Locksmiths to create a new key. Michael arrived just 20 minutes after I told him my problem. Less than 10 minutes later I have a chipped key and back on the road. Michael is very professional and clearly advised me of the process and cost for the job. I will recommend him to all of my friend.</text>

He went way beyond expectations to satisfy me, as the customer.

The property manager walked along the hallway and told him he would have to match our new lock to a master key that the manager had, which meant more work for him. The manager was impatient and asked the locksmith to return the following day, he did and got it all done and fixed for us. He also made extra keys for the new office.

All in all the pricing and service was tremendous.<//text>< pics>

This is the freaking best Locksmith in all long beach, seriously. They didn't try ripping me off or add extra fees, they took swift action and took care of the problem. The price was more than reasonable and the service was the best. There technician Michael, helped me open my car, make a key, and all at night freezing in the pouring rain. I'm most definitely going to continue business with this place.</Review>

The technician was kind and did his job efficiently. When I called for a quote they stated it starts at $65. I explained the type of lock and was still told the starting price. The technician came and opened my lock in less than 30 seconds with a key and wd40. Then charged me $210 and explained to me that it was because of advertising costs a lot lol. If you need it done quick this is a good company, but be prepared to be under quoted and over charged with a poor excuse for justification.</Text>

As good and easy as it gets.After a recent remodel project, I needed the house re-keyed.Michael was great on the phone but better when he arrived. After being told for years that our front door could not have the same key as the rest...he said not true and made it happen.
He also fixed some other lock issues he discovered free of charge.I don't need a locksmith often, but when I do, this is the guy.</text>

<Text>So we called a guy name Eddie over he didn't wanna mention how much it'll cost to get him here on the phone and told us you'll know later, so we trusted him. (He's only down the block 7 mins walk which we walked there according to Google Map and couldn't find his store front that's why we called). He got here and told us we're going to pay $29 for his travel and two twenty six for just the cabinet lock to be replaced. We agreed with that at first unknowingly it's $226 instead of $2.26, who knows this tiny safe lock can cost a whole new safe. Thank god we clarify the price with him again. Then he told us he went to school just for lock for three years and forced us in a way to buy his service since he's already here. I held him back and tell him we may have other option or let's not do it if that's the price cuz we can buy a whole new safe with it. He repeatedly said "it's up to you!" in an unfriendly manner and tone. We did not feel good even letting him into our door for his pushy manner. We're asking for someone who can do the job with a respectful manner and reasonable price. Understand customer's stand point and not force your service, this is not Wild Wild West nor wild China where you force someone must buy your service with an attitude. Completely scam! Now this is a lesson for your business feed, it's not always only about how good you are with your specialty but also how you work with your customers, and not to run your business with only money in mind but to provide a satisfying service so they'll return for your business to run long enough.</Text>< gmapID>

Other locksmiths have charged extra for this and that. Michael came in with one price and even after having to spend a little extra time that would have cost me another hundred from any other company, he kept his word and charged me exactly what he told me from the beginning. In 20 minutes from locking myself out I was inside and home. Thanks again brother!<//Review>< response>

I wish I had just broke the lock myself and purchased a new one for 25 bucks. I feel like I was taken advantage of in a bad situation. I have never heard of a locksmith charging that much for a simple lock out situation. Now I have to scramble to make up that money because who has an extra 600 dollars just lying around!?

Basically, they got the job done. So my criticism of the price is probably unfair. However, I would like to see them sharped up on the communication side of things - I had to tell my entire story to 3 separate people.</text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Source Capital is by far the best non-prime lender around (and I used to be a mortgage broker). Ryan was an absolute pleasure to deal with right from the start. It may have been the smoothest and easiest mortgage transaction I have ever dealt with.

From start to finish it was about 2 weeks from application to close of escrow. No BS, very upfront about the deal and NOTHING changed in the deal. Fees and rate were better than expected and better than similar lenders. Once we were in processing Marie took charge of all the paperwork, very on top of things and also was an absolute pleasure to work with.

If you need a non-prime loan, look no further. I wish I had found them sooner. Its too bad Google doesn't have 6 stars!</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

We picked source capital because of the reviews and we weren’t disappointed. Sasha was very patient and helpful with everything. This was our first time using a hard money loan and Sasha walked us through everything and didn’t hesitate to answer all of our questions. They were very quick to respond and Sasha went above and beyond to help us with everything since we were new to this. We look forward to use source capital in the future!<//Text>

I had plenty of equity in my property but did not have enough liquid cash for necessary improvements.  My partner recommended I try Source Capital. The founder, Sacha Ferrandi, and his excellent staff were most helpful and were always available to explain the process and answer all of my questions.  If you need a quickly approved, short term loan, I  would definitely recommend Source Capital Funding, Inc. for your next source of capital!<//Review>

<text>Dealing with hard money lenders are a major drag.  They lack transparency, communication, and normally keep you guessing.  Sacha and his team are superior in this industry and break the traditional rules.  They communicate, they answer their phone, they make your needs feel important and work over time to make sure your deadlines are kept.  Excellent customer services, customer responsiveness, and overall performance.  Can't wait to close another deal with these guy!</text>< Date>

I highly recommend Source Capital Funding. Sacha was really great: straight  to the point, easy to work with and highly reliable. Source Capital was there to provide both the letter of Intent and actual financing which unabled me to close on my investment property with no hassle. Their process is easy and they offer great flexibility. I will use Source Capital funding again</Review>

Always quick to return calls and respond to emails, Ryan and Marie helped make this loan go through smoothly and efficiently. I would not hesitate to recommend Source Capital for quick Hard Money loans, and I would gladly work with them again. If I ran into any issues along the way, Ryan worked with me to find a solution every time, and he was also open to my suggestions as well. First Class all the way!< /Review>

My first experience with Sacha was in 2011 and we have closed many loans since then.
Sacha, Ryan and Marie are always professional, on time and on the top of it. Excellent and fast and easy communication.
Their process is very convenient, mostly paperless and a lot can be done fast and remotely. If you have equity in your house they will work with you even if you have low credit score.
Recommend them highly.<//Review>

<Review>I was cleary hesitate to contact a hard money loan company through a website, without a face to face meeting or anyone recommendation, how could be possible over million dollar deal went through? But, Ryan Burns made this happen, after the 1st phone consultation, I decided to fill in application, and give out my personal information, we talked almost every two or three days to make sure the deal is there and nothing falling through.
The most amazing feel is Ryan complete the task on time, if he says he will provide the LOI by 5pm, you will get it. I was very pleased to work with Source Capital, there are plenty hard money loan company there, but Ryan will still be my first choice for my next project.< /Review><Response>None<//Response>< name>

<Text>My husband and I are renovating a property with a loan from Source Capital. The rate and fees from Source Capital were considerably lower than other quotes I received. As a first time hard money borrower, I was quite apprehensive with going this route, but Ryan and Marie answered all my many questions and made this process easy!  I highly recommend Source Capital and am sure we will work with them again on future projects.</Text>< Date>

To all who still want to believe that the impossible is possible, you must read my testimony/review!
The moment I began my paper work to the day the funds were placed into my company account, I was overwhelmed with the personal care that Source Capital Funding gave to me. As if I was a personal family member.
Fortunately for me, from the inception of my application, I was hand walked through the process by  Sacha Ferrandi Founder/Principle at Source Capital Funding.  His demeanor and charisma on the phone placed me at such ease and peace, being that I was in a financial checkmate with my company. At least that is what I thought until Mr. Ferrandi began to inform me of what his company could do for me. Not like the other funding companies who stated all the cant’s rather than the cans.
And it was with each team who assisted me through the process who were just as committed and knowledgeable of their product and the process of getting me the funding that I so needed to scale up my company. Truly this company not only trains their staff on processes but schools them on what is be live in the shoes of their clients. Truly elite customer service is agency is.
There are no words to express how appreciative I am of Source Capital Funding. My only way to truly express my appreciation is to land my company on the cover of Fortune 500 where I will state such businesses as Source Capital made the impossible become POSSIBLE.
To Mr. Ferrandi, Rayan Burns and the entire team of Source Capital Funding, because of your I CAN attitude towards me and my company, I am being catapulted to the forefront of the Sports Merchandise world. May my success remind each of you that your company is second to none in the FUNDING WORLD!
Thank you for making my bucket list of dreams become a reality!
With my sincerest gratitude

<Review>In my search for a hard money lender, I reviewed several companies, and after selecting my perceived top four, I then had a conversation with a key person from each company.  In the end, I choose to do business with Source Capital, and my experience confirms that it was the right decision. The company employs a two-step process where in the first stage there is the initial screening and possible offer, and in the second step there is the required documentation. The team was also willing to find solutions to issues that can arise in an application.

I was pleased with the process and can highly recommend Source Capital.< /Review>< time>

<Text>Sacha did an amazing job with my client's needs and the loan parameters and cost were lower than any other "alternative" lender has offered in the wholesale market.

Source Capital Funding proved to me that not all "hard money" lenders are not the same and the experience was analogous to that one would receive in a highly professional retail operation.  The communication was clear and consistent from start to finish and so glad I found this group to fund future loans.

If you are looking for a professional, honest and transparent process... CALL SACHA at Source Capital Funding.<//Text><user_name>KEN MOSS</user_name><rating>5<//rating><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<review>I am grateful to a business associate  who recommended Source Capital to me for my business funding needs. My needs were immediate & I was put in contact with Sacha Ferrandi. After being made aware of my needs, he verbally committed to fulfill them and promptly assisted me in completing the "Portal" required information with "Closing" accomplished quickly.
I was impressed with the professionalism and timeliness and would not hesitate to recommend the Firm to others with funding needs.</review><Response>None</Response>< rate>

Source Capital made the entire process easy and painless. They were upfront with what they needed and provided an offer very fast. I was somewhat surprised by how quick they wrapped it all up. They delivered exactly what they offered and did it very efficiently. I swear I've had car purchases that were more difficult and time consuming! I highly recommend Source Capital to anyone looking for an alternate source of funding when the "Banks" make it difficult.  Sacha and his team were great to deal with and very professional. I would not hesitate to use Source Capital in the future if needed.< /review>

We've invested with Source Capital Funding (SCF) since May 2019 including two individual investments.  In our experience, SCF was easy to work with in locating the best investment choices for us.  Sacha and Ryan are professional and knowledgeable....they respond timely to our inquiries.  We look forward to many years of investing with SCF!</review>

The process was fast, clean and effortless.  Great for those of us who need to use our bank info vs W-2's.  I will use him again in the future and hope to become one of his investors too.

Sacha performed beautifully, and was able to fund in 1 week.  He under-promised and over delivered!!!  This is the way it should be with any lending company.

I have dealt with many lending companies over the past 20 years, large banks, credit unions, and hard money lenders.  Source Capital Funding out did them all.  This is an incredible place if you need funding fast and with very reasonable terms, and you are not going to get any surprises at the end.

They are highly professional and will not give you the run around.  Highly recommended.<//Text>

I have knowledge of the industry since I have been in all facets of the loan business for over 40 years myself. Sacha always responded to my calls and emails - a true testament to professionalism. He's a great guy and a great company. I highly recommend Source Capital.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<review>I was so nervous and scared about doing a hard money loan on my house, I read all these stories and was given advise on this, but no one had anything nice to say. It was always negative,and rough.  I ignored all that and I took the leap myself, and I could not be happier and now a disbeliever in what people have to say about a hard money loan. I am sure there are some pretty shady people in this line of work, but with this company you do not have to worry about anything. The level of service they give you is unbelievable, I mean I have a little old house, and its needs some TLC, but they never once judged on the house or my credit score, they treated me like if I was their VIP client. They answered all my questions, no matter how many times I had to ask to finally understand it, and they don't rush you or give you any feeling to worry. I recommend to come here first.   They really helped me take my business to the next level with the loan I got. Thank you so much!!!!< /review>< Rate>

My experience with Source Capital has been wonderful, everything I had hoped for.  Sacha and the team are 100% professional, honest, and extremely knowledgeable.  The first time I worked with Sacha he took the time to explain the entire process and answered all my questions.  In all my transactions with Source Capital, they have always been transparent with the details and upfront.  The careful due diligence they perform on my transactions gives me great confidence and shows that Sacha is someone who really cares about doing things with integrity.  He truly looks out for us.  I know I’m in good hands and look forward to working with them for years to come.< /Review>

<text>It was a pleasure to work with Source Capital and in specific with Ryan, since the first time I contacted  SC, Ryan was very helpfully with me and during the process and helped me to get all the documents done together with Marie, which was also great.  It was not a simple process but they make it easily for me. They were very serious and professional all the time and made me an honest loan offer. I got the loan and now I am able to resolve some things and move forward with the fund of the loan.

My experience with Source Capital Funding was stress free.  I was kept up to date on all items and requirements in a timely manner, communication was excellent.  I appreciate doing business with Source Capital given that there are so many people to be relied upon in a real estate transaction.  The efficiency was a great relief.<//text>

We were looking to get a substantial loan and because of our situation traditional banks would not even give us the time of day. Although we had good credit we were running out of options. We contacted Ryan Burns at Source Capital who went to the ends of the earth for us. I highly recommend contacting Mr. Burns if you are looking for someone who will do WHATEVER they can to help you achieve your dreams and goals in life. You will not be disappointed. As usual, great customer service equaled great results!</text>

As an investor in real estate my liquid assets I was not able to re-invest as rapidly as I had hoped. With the help of Ryan Burns at Source Capital Funding I was able to quickly re-invest my monies into
properties to free up my dollars.  They were very responsive and able to meet my financial needs quickly and honestly.  Their attention to detail was much appreciated and they kept the paperwork to a minimum.  I will be using their services many times in the future.  I highly recommend them to anyone that is looking for investment capital for residential or commercial properties.  I currently have an associate that is planning to build a commercial property and plans to obtain additional funding from Source Capital.  Thank you Ryan.< /text>

I haven’t had any problems with him or the company. Each time I spoke with Sacha he always came off very professional and to the point. He answered my phone calls and emails usually within the same day which made me comfortable to know that my loan was moving forward towards funding, or if anything else was needed.

On one occasion I called in and was unable to speak with Sacha because he was out of the office. However, I spoke with Pat who was well informed about my loan and he was able to tell me what my loan status was. It’s nice to call a company and talk to people who know about your loan immediately and can give you information--especially when timing is so important. You’re not on hold when you call in and people you talk to know who you are, if you have submitted an application and are moving forward in the process.

On both occasions the funding came in on time and I was able to purchase an additional piece of property which turned out to be a great success. If I need another hard money loan I will be coming back again! Highly recommended!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I am very pleased with the communication and responsiveness of Source Capital Funding. I worked directly with Sacha Ferrandi, who was able to help me pull off an almost impossible financing situation. Sacha even gave me advice on funding another property that Source Capital could not finance. I highly recommend this company.</Review>

I am a mortgage broker. I just had one deal closed with Sacha's funding.  Source Capital funding  has good reasonable rate.  And Sacha means business.  He carried out what he promised. And he would take care the rest if he has too. He respects me and my business to him.  I was happy with the result.    I will contact  Source Capital Funding for my next deal.< /Text>

I can't say enough about The Source Capital Team. Ryan Burns is truly a fantastic person to work with. He is efficient, extremely friendly and responsive. When there are a lot of choices for lenders to use, sometimes it can be challenging knowing who to go with, however Ryan stands out from the crowd. As soon as I met him I could tell his authenticity and how much he genuinely cares about his business and taking care of his clients. 5 Stars all the way! Thanks Ryan and Source Capital Team!<//review>

Wow, where do I begin.  We live in Minnesota.  We had found a home we wanted to purchase to rehab but needed the funding right away to close the deal.  We then started searching for different lending options.  We were very grateful that we found Source Capital Funding, Inc.  Source Capital Funding, was very professional, easy to work with, friendly and they did what they said they would do in our short time frame.  We needed help fast, and they were there every step of the way.  A big Thank-You to Ryan, who stepped up to the plate and helped us make a Grand-Slam, Home Run!  We definitely would recommend them to anyone.< /review>

<Gmap_id>0x80dbf72ba5c0fa41:0x6fd1a9dea83779ea< /Gmap_id><Text>I wanted to do cash out refinance on my home as I was looking to expand my family business. I called Source Capital I talked to Sacha Ferranti and told him what I wanted to do. I told him my credit was not good as it showed a foreclosure a year ago. I asked him if it was possible to get cash out refinance with my credit. Sacha told me he was the lender, he also told me not to worry that he will get me approved within 24 hours. He was amazing; and I had a commitment before the end of the day. I was not aware of any title issues on my property until they pulled a preliminary title.

This was becoming the loan for hell, with all the title problems, the foreclosure, my low credit score and my lack of income. Sacha was a tremendous help me and was very proactive, one by one he cleared all the problems. The loan would have funded in 10 days as he had promised, but because of the title problems we had to wait until title had cleared the issues. Every time a new problem popped Sacha was there letting me know that he would solve it for me. He kept telling me not to worry and that everything would be fine.

I am happy to say, my loan funded on September 5, 2017. I personally was in the mortgage loan origination business for over 35 years. I have seen many difficult loans and have funded many tough loans myself.  Sacha was truly professional, and made a very tough loan run smoothly, I truly believe that this loan would not have funded if not for Sacha and “Source Capital”. Thank you very much Sacha, you were great and I will recommend you to everyone I know.< /Text></record>

It was suggested that I look at the use of hard money lenders to quickly acquire funds needed to financially reposition our company for our next move.  I was fortunate to have contacted Ryan and his company.  They were very understanding, helpful and able to close on the funding quickly.  Any questions I had were answered promptly so that I was better able to understand the process.  They were very easy to work with and I enjoyed a very positive experience with Source Capital.</review>

I lucked out when I found this company.  As a new business owner, I wasn't experienced enough to plan out everything I was going to encounter and when I found myself in need of help, I called Source Capital Funding, Inc.  It turned out to be the best decision because not only did Ryan Burns educate me on how the industry works, but he was warm and empathetic which made the process easy to go through.  I totally expected a cold, business-like process, but his manner and the assistance I received from his assistant, Marie Gleason, put me at ease super quick.  I would totally recommend this company to anyone who finds themselves in a position where they need help with the utmost discretion.  Thanks guys!< /review>

Recently completed another flawless re-fi transaction with Ryan & Sacha.  Why would anyone go to anyone else?  They're the best!

As an experienced real estate broker in the Bay Area, Sacha is my new 'go to' guy for private lending.  After dealing with three different private lenders who failed to perform for my Buyers on their new home purchase, Sacha saved the deal - and delivered exactly what he promised, when promised.  His focus on customer service is a 10+.  He's now on my speed dial.  Don't hesitate to use Source Capital.  They deserve more than 5 stars!</Text>

<review>We have tried various traditional lenders to only end up being told we either needed to be living in the house or have 12 months good mortgage history. Well the house was forced into probate a month after my father's death. It was there for 7 months. In that time it got behind. My mother has an apartment and wanted to fix up the house for my son and I. It would be safer for him having a locked yard to play in being special needs. Yet over and over we were told no.

It came down to the wire where money was running out paying a mortgage and rent. One more month would have been detrimental. Sacha and his staff saved the day and the house dad had fought two wars for.  My son is scheduled to have his first backyard Oct. 1st. Thank you Sacha, Maria and especially Valerie at Fidelity for taking all my calls. Thank YOU Sacha for always replying to my emails and also taking my calls. I am very protective of my mother and you guys understood and respected that. You all are Godsent. Thank you again.<//review>< Response>

As an appraiser who has worked with Sacha and Patrick for the last 3 + years.  I can confidently say they are the most professional, prompt, courteous, and efficient private lender I have ever worked with!!  They spend countless hours working with their client's needs, whom several I have also had the pleasure of working with. They always stay current upon all of the recent changes regarding the lending industry, as well as local rules. It is always a pleasure working with anyone within their company.  Keep up the good work!! Our company values your hard work and dedication and thanks you for the continuing business.</review>

<Review>This was the second time I used the services of Source Capital.  The service exceeded my high expectations based upon my first loan.   I recommend all whom are in need of business purposes loans to consider contacting Source Capital and its founder and principal, Sacha Ferrandi.  You will be pleasantly surprised by the high degree of service and personal attention to detail.  Source Capital also makes loans in Arizona not just California.  Just contact them for details.

<Text>Sacha and everyone at Source Capital were friendly, efficient, professional, and easy to work with. Due to circumstances of my own making, I was forced to use a hard money lender. The loan was explained in detail to me, and I knew exactly what I was getting in to. The only issues I had with the whole process were ones created by my bank and Sacha and Marie were very patient, understanding and helpful. I wish that doing business at my own banks were as easy and pleasant as dealing with Sacha and company. If I am in need of a hard money loan again, I will not hesitate to use Source Capital.<//Text><time>1427327669662<//time><Resp>None<//Resp><Name>Richard Butler<//Name><userid>112257965135740892232< /userid>< GmapID>

<Text>Sacha was very helpful and provided a lot of information while assisting me with getting my loan. Sacha and his team was very professional and courteous while helping me close my loan. Sacha and his team answered all of my emails and phone calls in a timely manner. I will definitely recommend source capital to my friends. I will be using source capital again in the future.

<text>I would have loved the opportunity to write a rave review however, I was discriminated against and not even extended the courtesy to submit an application or go over the available loan programs. I sent in an inquiry after reading the great reviews and received a callback the following day. I was advised the program I sent the inquiry regarding was no longer available and I noted to the rep the program was listed on their website and inquired about the program which is now in place. I was abruptly asked for my address and firmly advised I was not eligible to receive any information regarding loan programs due to inquiry for the program which is no longer available. Being in the real estate industry 20 years I knew this was very strange to refuse or deter a customer from applying or discussing loan programs and again requested information. I was then advised " This would be very expensive capital". I have received training for years on various types of discrimination however, never thought I would experience it first hand. I thanked the rep and ended the call feeling the void of being treated equally as a customer. Very unfortunate.<//text>< Pics>

<Resp>{'time': 1538510470947, 'text': 'As the owner, I am immediately responding to this negative review as I think this individual is being somewhat aggressive with their words- especially as it pertains to being "discriminated against".   This firm, as stated on our website and the form this individual completed, only funds loans secured by real estate for business purposes only.   To say that you were "abruptly asked" about your address is harsh.  As an asset based lender, our focus is solely on the purpose of the loan and the real estate being pledged as collateral for the loan.  This is the main reason we ask for the address to the property.  To say that you were not "eligible to receive information" is completely erroneous and false.   We pride ourselves on educating ALL clients so they are aware of what programs we offer and don\'t offer so they are informed about all aspects of our business.  Because you did not qualify for our loan means nothing more than that.  To make an attempt to cast a negative light on this firm because you did not fit into our lending criteria is in very poor taste.  Our reputation speaks for itself and we will not allow for the general public to not be informed about the facts.  In this case, the facts speak for themselves.'}</Resp><gmap_id>0x80dbf72ba5c0fa41:0x6fd1a9dea83779ea< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Great experience from start to finish.  Top notch team lead by owner Sacha.  This was the most professional experience that I have had with any financial transaction I have been involved with and there were a few tricky things that we had to deal with.

I definitely recommend them to anyone and will use them again myself!

UPDATE - Jhoybell in their office has been very helpful with some admin issues that popped up during the servicing of my loan.  Resolved quickly and in a very professional manner.</Review>

Highly recommend this company if you need money fast and you value efficiency.  I received a commitment to fund within 5 days of my initial contact and received funding within 3 weeks of beginning my search.  Sacha Ferrendi contacted me within 2 days and that was over a holiday weekend.  Staff was efficient and communicated well about all paper work needed.   Everyone worked diligently to tie all loose ends and  finalize the funding.   Will go back to them again if I need funding in the future.< /review>

<Review>A completely professional yet friendly environment. Had never done financial transactions
long distance before but i am quite glad i did. Ryan as a partner in the firm, dealt with me
directly and then turned me over to Marie who was amazingly knowledgeable about actually
getting it done; a real professional. I would and probably will deal with them again and I recommend
them heartily.< /Review><UserId.>107745071220215964673<//UserId.><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

This is my second hard money loan with Source Capital and the service was excellent. What I appreciated was the prompt response to my phone calls, e-mails and working with my escrow company. They funded my loan quickly,on time and made this real estate purchase easier to accomplish. I would strongly recommend using them and I will do so in the future.

As a lender myself, working with someone like him shows that there are still a lot of good people in our industry, and we will definitely be in connection to do future business together. Job well done.</review><date>1426701506668< /date><GmapID>0x80dbf72ba5c0fa41:0x6fd1a9dea83779ea</GmapID>< response>

Ryan, and the rest of staff don't spare any efforts to get our financing done within proposed budget and on time every time. We are so glad to finally find an excellent lender to partner with in our real estate projects.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>We have closed multiple loans with these guys over the past five years and have had mostly good experiences. However, they recently stuck us with an almost $2000 bill over the fine print on a refi transaction that was not required. The loan was never closed and they still got paid. We expected better service from a longtime business partner. A win-win approach to business is not a primary value of this company. Buyer beware.</Review><Resp>{'time': 1501619082413, 'text': 'As the owner of the firm, I am responding to Mr. Willis directly as I personally handled this transaction.  As such, the executed Agreement clearly states what constitutes this firm earning a fee if the borrower does not perform.  In this case, the borrower signed the Agreement which allowed us to engage in the underwriting and funding of the loan.  During the process, the borrower made the decision, not this firm, to not move forward for their own personal reasons.  At that point, per the Agreement and our normal protocol, he was promptly charged the fee, which was paid with no questions or concerns.  I am quoting directly from his email when he states "I understand there are some costs involved from Source Capital. In this case only, would you be willing to lower the doc prep fee."  I even went so far as to offer to reduce the fee the next time we did business over half the amount as a gesture of good will.\n\nTo state that Mr. Willis was "stuck with a bill" over fine print is false.  As Mr. Willis has closed multiple loans with this firm, which we appreciate very much, I would think that one would be familiar with our process and the "fine print" mentioned.  I am sorry the borrower is unhappy and felt the need to leave a negative review but the Agreement signed is fair and was a result of the borrowers failure to perform as agreed.   John, I wish you the best of luck with what you are doing but it is evident we are not a good fit for business.  I take these comments very seriously and it is not fair to shed this firm in a negative light because of your sole decision to not move forward.'}< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>I have invested with Source Capital Funding more than 30 times over the last 3 years and have yielded a consistent 10.44% return! I am so confident in Sacha Ferrandi and his team that I have encouraged family members and friends to invest as well. If you are seeking a low risk, high return investment opportunity with a company that is conservative, up to date on compliance issues and conducts extremely thorough underwriting, Source Capital Funding is an excellent choice. I give them an A+< /text><Gmap_id>0x80dbf72ba5c0fa41:0x6fd1a9dea83779ea</Gmap_id>< Pictures>

<Review>I'd like to sincerely thank Sacha Ferrandi and Marie Gleason for a thorough, quick and simple processing of my recent loan. Like many consumers, I was hesitant to apply for a "hard money" loan due to the fees involved.  However, I found myself mistaken and the costs reasonable and affordable with no need to come up with out of pocket money to close. As a single mom facing financial challenges, family losses and health issues within a short time period, Sasha worked diligently with me to help resolve my immediate funding issues even though my loan was small. I highly recommend Source Capital Funding to any person/business in need of a quick loan, and in my situation having only property equity to secure funds. Thank you for helping me through a very difficult time - greatly appreciated.<//Review><date>1444410717595<//date>< GmapID>

<text>To whom it may Concern:

We recently reached out to Source-Capital to procure financing for a building owned by a client of mine dealing with a messy probate situation.  An 8-year probate nightmare with numerous lawyers and a myriad of unresolved issues.  Little did I know, there were more significant challenges that we would need to overcome along the way.

Sacha was most helpful from the beginning of the process all the way to the end.  It was obvious we were more than just another deal to be closed.  Source Capital really cared about what my client was going through.

Sacha helped my client arrive at a realistic assessment of the value of their property while providing various options fulfilling specialized requests.

Because of his advice and direction, a potentially turbulent file has been delicately maneuvered through the minutiae of requisite Court approvals and various Title issues.

All in all, Sacha and his team have been very knowledgeable about the whole process of obtaining financing and everything was explained in detail, step-by-step.

Sacha always took my phone calls when we had questions or needed clarification. Irregardless of the query, we had an answer which allowed us to move forward.

I would be remiss not to mention Jhoybell, who pleasantly answers the phone giving assistance, direction and encouragement when needed.  Her service was impeccable and her warmth and genuine interest in our file was very much appreciated.

We might have never been able to pull this off without Sacha and the Source Capital team.  They are true professionals.

I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend these guys PERIOD!

THANKS AGAIN!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>Source Capital Funding does what it advertises. They are a time sensible equity based hard money lender that will deliver a decision on a hard money scenario within hours of submission, fund and close within next few days. No games, no lengthy underwriting, no multiple request for additional conditions.
If you need to close fast with no games, I strongly suggest source capital and Sacha Ferrandi.<//Review><Date>1464626719461< /Date>< UserId.>

From my experience, Sacha (owner of source capital) is a very passionate and conscientious person to work with.  His heart is in the right place and he can be trusted when it comes to getting you the money you need, but also in life in general.

It's the "life in general" part that means to most to me.  If you are a good person fundamentally, then your services are likely to be high quality too.<//Review>

Dear Sacha -

It was a pleasure working with you and Source Capital Funding.  I appreciate how efficient and professional it was in obtaining funding for our business, and I especially appreciate your patience and understanding in dealing with delays I experienced due to my husband's health issues.  I will gladly recommend Source Capital Funding to anyone looking for capital for their business. Thank you for your professionalism.

< Review>
After being turned down for a loan twice, me and my husband weren't very optimistic about being able to get one from anybody. However, I googled private lenders and found Source Capital Funding. Not only did we get our money within days of doing the paperwork, the paperwork was brought to my house over the weekend, which was very convenient due to a busy work schedule, and it made the process go quicker. Also, there was never a time when I couldn't get in touch with anybody and they were always eager to help and willing to offer their experience to better our own business! We are VERY happy with their service and I totally recommend them to anybody needing their financial services! I also want to thank Sacha Ferrandi for all his advice and helping me with all the questions I had! Thank you!< /Review>

Source Capital is a great Finance Company to work with. I went through a 8 month process of buying a house that was a Short Sale and they held my hand through the whole process. Sasha Ferrandi is a great guy to work with. I highly recommend them.

Honest and Flexible!  I strongly recommend Sacha in Source Capital Lending with whom I have worked several times. Sacha is very honest -- the fees and interest rate are very reasonable for a HML, and there are no annoying and expensive fees and points beyond what is initially discussed. Further, Sacha is flexible and helped a lot when I needed his help when converting his HML loan to a conventional loan with one of the traditional lenders. He does not charge prepayment penalties and did not give me any hurdles when I refinanced his loan with the other lender. Further, at another occasion when I refinanced his loans in house, his points for the refinance were also very reasonable. Sacha gets the job done quickly, and I know I can always count on him when there is a good investment opportunity and I need the cash quickly.</Review>

This is the first time I decided to use hard money loan and after some research, I decided to try Source Capital.  My experience with them has been terrific, they were very professional, answered and explain all my questions, and I will definitely use them for my future hard money option.  Sacha is the partner that worked with me from day 1 and I highly recommend his company.< /text>

<text>Dear Sacha -

It was a pleasure working with you and Source Capital Funding.  I appreciate how efficient and professional it was in obtaining funding for our business, and I especially appreciate your patience and understanding in dealing with delays I experienced due to my husband's health issues.  I will gladly recommend Source Capital Funding to anyone looking for capital for their business. Thank you for your professionalism.

<Text>This lender is Ahhh-mazing! Highly recommended. I worked in mortgage over a twenty-year period, in everything from loan servicing to underwriting so I understand many aspects of the business. For me, this type of loan was a first and a tough decision but really the only option in my particular circumstance. Ryan, is great, he listens well and is very patient. We had long discussions about all my concerns and never did I feel pressured or get the sense that he was annoyed at having to answer my questions. He's very professional. Marie was my processor. She was very polite and helpful. Overall the entire process was exceptional, quick and very easy. I'll be passing their information along to two of my long time real estate agent partners for referrals and will most definitely consider them as a funding source for future business. Thank you for your great service!</Text><Rate>5< /Rate><username>Pamela Edgar<//username><Pictures>None< /Pictures><UserId.>118015267032155448647</UserId.><resp>None<//resp><date>1444710968649</date>< gmap_id>

I brought a "challenging" file, reverse 1031 exchange,  to Sacha at Source Capital 10 days ago. Sacha and his team were able to get the loan funded thus saving my clients purchase transaction and more importantly saving his tax exemption for the 1031 exchange. I appreciate, as did my client, the swift and professionalism Sacha and his team provided.<//Review>

I have worked with Sacha Ferrandi and Source Capital for over two years.
Their products are services are second to none in the private money realm.
If you are looking for a credible, knowledgeable and honest team then look no further.

I have been a customer of Source Capital Funding since 2011.
To begin, they helped me in an urgent time of need.  They provided me with assistance in obtaining a mortgage when my credit would not allow for any traditional loans.  Not only did they come through with a very fair interest rate, they also helped me close in 2 weeks!
Now, after 3 years of providing me with outstanding service, they have gone the extra mile to renew my loan and take a world of worries off my shoulders.
I would HIGHLY recommend them to anyone looking for assistance.  They have been nothing short of amazing.<//Review>

*** UPDATE ***
Here's a copy of the infamous email:

"
Silvio –

I left you a VM regarding this matter (see attached).  Please call me ASAP to discuss your intentions.   If I do not hear from you, we will commence foreclosure proceedings April 2, 2017.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Ryan
"

NOTE: The VM was left less than 30 minutes before the email arrived in my inbox.

I don't have an issue with being notified that the balloon payment due date is coming soon. My problem was with the language.

I do appreciate Ryan's email on 8/2/2017 admitting the unneeded use of the term "foreclosure" and apologizing for it, but after reading the response below I'm not so sure it was a genuine rectification.

=== ORIGINAL REVIEW ===
At the beginning the process was fast and easy.
No issues throughout the period of the loan until March 8, 2017, 24 days before its maturity, when I get a very distasteful email asking to "discuss my intentions" and that foreclosure proceedings will commence on Sunday, April 2, 2017, the very next day after the balloon payment was due. Well, that is common knowledge. But what is really upsetting is that I  was never, ever late with any monthly payment and had already paid approximately 60% of the principal when that email arrived like a slap in my face.
In my opinion that sort of language was completely unnecessary and the only outcome of it was my change in opinion about this company.
Friendly advice: you shouldn't ever mention foreclosing a property before you can actually do it. Much less mention it to someone with a pristine payment record as mine.< /review>
<response>{'time': 1501618276706, 'text': '*UPDATE* I believe that the entire chain of emails is relevant to what transpired. On March 8, 2017, after you responded, we wrote: "Silvio –You are correct. The loan is not due until April 1st. I just wanted to give you a courtesy call. Good to hear it will be taken care of. Thank you for the quick response. Let me know if you need anything. I am here to help."\nI am not sure how these responses are not "genuine" but I believe it shows we do care and take these matters seriously.  It is unfortunate to receive a negative review but it is your opinion and you have that right.  We are confident that the hundreds of positive reviews we have received and our A+ rating with the BBB truly reflect this company and the services we provide.\n\nAs one of the two principals of the company, I am responding to this from Mr. Belini.  As a licensed lender, we are required to provide a "Balloon Payment Notice" not less than 90 nor more than 150 days before the balloon payment is due, regardless of the borrower\'s payment history.  In this case, we did not hear from the client and went above and beyond the normal scope of what is required and provided another reminder via email.  As we keep all correspondence on file for 5 years, I have a copy of the email and to state that this was "very distasteful" is simply not true..  The fact is that the borrower was notified on more than one occasion that the loan was coming due and we simply needed a response to see if the borrower wanted to extend or what their intentions were.  Mentioning the word "foreclosure" when a balloon payment due is standard legal language that must be utilized per law.  To take offense to such language is an issue that should be taken up with the legislators that govern the laws of lending.  All we did was follow the book on what is required.  To leave a negative review because we went out of our way to notify you of your loan coming due is not fair.'}< /response><date>1508296178596< /date></record>

I had an absolute pleasure working with Sacha Ferrandi at Source Capital Funding.  His professionalism and work ethics set him apart from others.  Sacha was able to fund a complicated multi million dollar transaction in 2 weeks.   GREAT JOB!

I highly recommend and look forward to working with Sacha again.

You were clear with your questions, honest with your dealings, straight forward with your paperwork demands, whatever you promised you delivered, knowledgeable of your profession, always respectful and without hesitation I'll recommend you to friends.< /Text>< pics>

We were in a bind with a home loan that fell through unexpectedly.  We researched various private money lenders, and we came across SCF.  Sasha and his team were fantastic to work with.  We had very little time to work with.  Sasha is a straight shooter and does what he says he going to do.  We had everything riding on his performance and he came through as promised.  Thank you SCF!  We are now loving being in our dream home.< /text>

<Review>I called Sacha Ferrandi on October 2, 2014 to inquire if I could get a loan on a condominium in San Diego, California that I own that had no mortgage.  I advised him that I needed the money to pay the IRS and California Franchise Tax Board 2013 taxes that were due October 15, 2014.  With has expert help and guidance, we were able to complete the process over the internet and very quickly.  I was able to pay my taxes on time.  Thanks, Sacha.  You were a life saver!  Jerel L.

<Review>Source Capital is by far the best non-prime lender around (and I used to be a mortgage broker). Ryan was an absolute pleasure to deal with right from the start. It may have been the smoothest and easiest mortgage transaction I have ever dealt with.

From start to finish it was about 2 weeks from application to close of escrow. No BS, very upfront about the deal and NOTHING changed in the deal. Fees and rate were better than expected and better than similar lenders. Once we were in processing Marie took charge of all the paperwork, very on top of things and also was an absolute pleasure to work with.

If you need a non-prime loan, look no further. I wish I had found them sooner. Its too bad Google doesn't have 6 stars!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Where do I begin? Ryan and the company in it's entirety are unmatched. Not just in the funding industry (residential, or commercial) but just a cream of the crop company all the way through.They lit a fire and gave me a torch. Personally & Professionally, look no further- Source Capital Funding is your go to. There is no second choice or backup! Source  C.F. simply stayed with me and didn't waver or quit, or even made it seem like that was even a remote thought. In these challenging times, especially with the pandemic? I would go again and again, and would refer possible clientele to Source Capital in a heartbeat. Ryan, Marie, Jenna.-You can't find better people or a better team here or anywhere. 100 thumbs up. The best from coast to coast. They understand this era we are in and rise to and above the challenge. Ryan & Source, cannot thank you enough. E.Dunn< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

We picked source capital because of the reviews and we weren’t disappointed. Sasha was very patient and helpful with everything. This was our first time using a hard money loan and Sasha walked us through everything and didn’t hesitate to answer all of our questions. They were very quick to respond and Sasha went above and beyond to help us with everything since we were new to this. We look forward to use source capital in the future!</Review>

<text>I'd worked with Source Capital Funding a few years ago when I needed a short-term loan for my business.  Using my home's equity, founder Sacha Ferrandi guided me through the process and I very quickly had the funds I needed.  I recently referred my partner to Source Capital when she wanted to make some improvements on her property, and I would recommend them highly for anyone in need of a fast, streamlined bridge loan.

i was referred by a trusted business colleague and my particular experience from the outset was extremely fruitful and exceeded my expectations. The application process was very straightforward  but subject to some delays of my own making. Sacha was very patient and ultimately delivered a proposal which perfectly suited my requirements. I would use Source Capital again without hesitation and moreover invest with the company in the future. In summary, my experience with Source Capital easily exceeded the Five Star limit!< /review>

I highly recommend Source Capital Funding. Sacha was really great: straight  to the point, easy to work with and highly reliable. Source Capital was there to provide both the letter of Intent and actual financing which unabled me to close on my investment property with no hassle. Their process is easy and they offer great flexibility. I will use Source Capital funding again< /Review>

Always quick to return calls and respond to emails, Ryan and Marie helped make this loan go through smoothly and efficiently. I would not hesitate to recommend Source Capital for quick Hard Money loans, and I would gladly work with them again. If I ran into any issues along the way, Ryan worked with me to find a solution every time, and he was also open to my suggestions as well. First Class all the way!<//text>

<Text>I have done a few loans with Source One and the experience has always been smooth. Sacha responded fast to emails and call with questions about the terms and process each time and once the commitment was agreed to the process was easy. I would recommend him to others and I will be doing business with him in the future for sure.< /Text>< user>

Sacha, Ryan and Marie are always professional, on time and on the top of it. Excellent and fast and easy communication.
Their process is very convenient, mostly paperless and a lot can be done fast and remotely. If you have equity in your house they will work with you even if you have low credit score.
Recommend them highly.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>Eleven years ago we were fortunate enough to find Source Capital through a friend at our club.  We started out with investing 5 percent of our worth as our initial investment.  We  gradually increased our participation because of continued success with Source Capital and now have entrusted 90 percent of our worth with them.  We are so comfortable and secure with Source Capital, that we have felt at ease introducing many of our friends and family to this wonderful company.  We enthusiastically recommend this highly knowledgeable and professional company.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

<Review>I was cleary hesitate to contact a hard money loan company through a website, without a face to face meeting or anyone recommendation, how could be possible over million dollar deal went through? But, Ryan Burns made this happen, after the 1st phone consultation, I decided to fill in application, and give out my personal information, we talked almost every two or three days to make sure the deal is there and nothing falling through.
The most amazing feel is Ryan complete the task on time, if he says he will provide the LOI by 5pm, you will get it. I was very pleased to work with Source Capital, there are plenty hard money loan company there, but Ryan will still be my first choice for my next project.< /Review>< Pictures>

I call Source Capital Funding and talk to Mr. Ryan Burns. He was so helpful to me on Refinancing my property. And he did very fast! Had no problem he handled everything for me. So if anyone need to refinance please give a call he will get you the loan. Thanks Ryan for everything you did for me.</text>

My husband and I are renovating a property with a loan from Source Capital. The rate and fees from Source Capital were considerably lower than other quotes I received. As a first time hard money borrower, I was quite apprehensive with going this route, but Ryan and Marie answered all my many questions and made this process easy!  I highly recommend Source Capital and am sure we will work with them again on future projects.< /text>

The moment I began my paper work to the day the funds were placed into my company account, I was overwhelmed with the personal care that Source Capital Funding gave to me. As if I was a personal family member.
Fortunately for me, from the inception of my application, I was hand walked through the process by  Sacha Ferrandi Founder/Principle at Source Capital Funding.  His demeanor and charisma on the phone placed me at such ease and peace, being that I was in a financial checkmate with my company. At least that is what I thought until Mr. Ferrandi began to inform me of what his company could do for me. Not like the other funding companies who stated all the cant’s rather than the cans.
And it was with each team who assisted me through the process who were just as committed and knowledgeable of their product and the process of getting me the funding that I so needed to scale up my company. Truly this company not only trains their staff on processes but schools them on what is be live in the shoes of their clients. Truly elite customer service is agency is.
There are no words to express how appreciative I am of Source Capital Funding. My only way to truly express my appreciation is to land my company on the cover of Fortune 500 where I will state such businesses as Source Capital made the impossible become POSSIBLE.
To Mr. Ferrandi, Rayan Burns and the entire team of Source Capital Funding, because of your I CAN attitude towards me and my company, I am being catapulted to the forefront of the Sports Merchandise world. May my success remind each of you that your company is second to none in the FUNDING WORLD!
Thank you for making my bucket list of dreams become a reality!
With my sincerest gratitude

In the end, I choose to do business with Source Capital, and my experience confirms that it was the right decision. The company employs a two-step process where in the first stage there is the initial screening and possible offer, and in the second step there is the required documentation. The team was also willing to find solutions to issues that can arise in an application.

I was pleased with the process and can highly recommend Source Capital.</Review>< UserId.>

Sacha did an amazing job with my client's needs and the loan parameters and cost were lower than any other "alternative" lender has offered in the wholesale market.

Source Capital Funding proved to me that not all "hard money" lenders are not the same and the experience was analogous to that one would receive in a highly professional retail operation.  The communication was clear and consistent from start to finish and so glad I found this group to fund future loans.

If you are looking for a professional, honest and transparent process... CALL SACHA at Source Capital Funding.< /Review>

I am grateful to a business associate  who recommended Source Capital to me for my business funding needs. My needs were immediate & I was put in contact with Sacha Ferrandi. After being made aware of my needs, he verbally committed to fulfill them and promptly assisted me in completing the "Portal" required information with "Closing" accomplished quickly.
I was impressed with the professionalism and timeliness and would not hesitate to recommend the Firm to others with funding needs.<//text>

Source Capital made the entire process easy and painless. They were upfront with what they needed and provided an offer very fast. I was somewhat surprised by how quick they wrapped it all up. They delivered exactly what they offered and did it very efficiently. I swear I've had car purchases that were more difficult and time consuming! I highly recommend Source Capital to anyone looking for an alternate source of funding when the "Banks" make it difficult.  Sacha and his team were great to deal with and very professional. I would not hesitate to use Source Capital in the future if needed.< /Text>

We've invested with Source Capital Funding (SCF) since May 2019 including two individual investments.  In our experience, SCF was easy to work with in locating the best investment choices for us.  Sacha and Ryan are professional and knowledgeable....they respond timely to our inquiries.  We look forward to many years of investing with SCF!< /review>

<Review>Sacha was so wonderful with our loan request.  He understands that as a property developer when you ask for money you need it fast. The process was fast, clean and effortless.  Great for those of us who need to use our bank info vs W-2's.  I will use him again in the future and hope to become one of his investors too.  As somebody who has used hard-money loans in both California and Texas, this company far exceeds the rest.</Review><gmapID>0x80dbf72ba5c0fa41:0x6fd1a9dea83779ea<//gmapID><Response>None<//Response>< Time>

<Review>Sacha performed beautifully, and was able to fund in 1 week.  He under-promised and over delivered!!!  This is the way it should be with any lending company.

I have dealt with many lending companies over the past 20 years, large banks, credit unions, and hard money lenders.  Source Capital Funding out did them all.  This is an incredible place if you need funding fast and with very reasonable terms, and you are not going to get any surprises at the end.

They are highly professional and will not give you the run around.  Highly recommended.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

After working with traditional bankers trying to obtain a loan for a new business venture without any results, I reached out to Source Funding and got in touch with Ryan. He was not only able to make it happen, but was able to do it very quickly. With the help of Maria working with me on the information I needed as far as paperwork, we were all able to make it happen on time. They were both courteous, professional, and came though as promised. I highly recommend them and Source Funding, and will definitely work with them in the future if needed.</Text>

It was always negative,and rough.  I ignored all that and I took the leap myself, and I could not be happier and now a disbeliever in what people have to say about a hard money loan. I am sure there are some pretty shady people in this line of work, but with this company you do not have to worry about anything. The level of service they give you is unbelievable, I mean I have a little old house, and its needs some TLC, but they never once judged on the house or my credit score, they treated me like if I was their VIP client. They answered all my questions, no matter how many times I had to ask to finally understand it, and they don't rush you or give you any feeling to worry. I recommend to come here first.   They really helped me take my business to the next level with the loan I got. Thank you so much!!!!<//Review>< user_name>

This company and staff conducted business in an efficient and professional manner. Every person that I came into contact with was courteous, respectful and very polite. The company was very helpful in every way and most important of all they were true to their word, fulfilled every promise made and helped to guide me step by step through a difficult process. I would recommend Sasha Ferrandi and Source Capital to any friend or business associate in need of funding.

Thank you Sasha and Source Capital for all of your assistance.</Review>

<Review>I had the wonderful privilege to have worked with Ryan Burns at Source Capital Funding. We were in need of some cash to remodel and purchase a second investment property, and Ryan was not too far from perfection in providing the right help and advise to quickly acquire the necessary funds to accomplish our business plans. He was able to approve and fund the loan within matter of days. Today, we are in good shape to get approved on a conventional loan for a second investment property, thanks to Source Capital and its valuable representative, Ryan Burns. If you are in need of quick cash and have dreams to fulfill, you need not look very far.<//Review>< pics>

Great Company! They worked non-stop on our loan and funded quickly. We were always able to get our questions answered right away and Sacha helped walk us through everything. Their rates were very competitive. I recommend highly and will be passing their information on to family and friends.</text>

<review>My experience with Source Capital has been wonderful, everything I had hoped for.  Sacha and the team are 100% professional, honest, and extremely knowledgeable.  The first time I worked with Sacha he took the time to explain the entire process and answered all my questions.  In all my transactions with Source Capital, they have always been transparent with the details and upfront.  The careful due diligence they perform on my transactions gives me great confidence and shows that Sacha is someone who really cares about doing things with integrity.  He truly looks out for us.  I know I’m in good hands and look forward to working with them for years to come.</review>< pics>

Source Capital to the rescue. Working with Sacha Ferrandi at Source Capital was a breeze. I needed immediate funding and Sacha was there. My situation was complex, but that didn’t stop Source Capital.Obviously there are many lenders out there; however, I chose Source Capital because of their reputation, professionalism, and efficiency. I would work with Sacha again and highly recommend this company.<//Text>

<text>As an investor in real estate my liquid assets I was not able to re-invest as rapidly as I had hoped. With the help of Ryan Burns at Source Capital Funding I was able to quickly re-invest my monies into
properties to free up my dollars.  They were very responsive and able to meet my financial needs quickly and honestly.  Their attention to detail was much appreciated and they kept the paperwork to a minimum.  I will be using their services many times in the future.  I highly recommend them to anyone that is looking for investment capital for residential or commercial properties.  I currently have an associate that is planning to build a commercial property and plans to obtain additional funding from Source Capital.  Thank you Ryan.</text>< user_id>

<user_id>111771072607537637312</user_id>< Review>
I got two hard money loans from Sacha at Source Capital. I haven’t had any problems with him or the company. Each time I spoke with Sacha he always came off very professional and to the point. He answered my phone calls and emails usually within the same day which made me comfortable to know that my loan was moving forward towards funding, or if anything else was needed.

On one occasion I called in and was unable to speak with Sacha because he was out of the office. However, I spoke with Pat who was well informed about my loan and he was able to tell me what my loan status was. It’s nice to call a company and talk to people who know about your loan immediately and can give you information--especially when timing is so important. You’re not on hold when you call in and people you talk to know who you are, if you have submitted an application and are moving forward in the process.

On both occasions the funding came in on time and I was able to purchase an additional piece of property which turned out to be a great success. If I need another hard money loan I will be coming back again! Highly recommended!</Review>

I am very pleased with the communication and responsiveness of Source Capital Funding. I worked directly with Sacha Ferrandi, who was able to help me pull off an almost impossible financing situation. Sacha even gave me advice on funding another property that Source Capital could not finance. I highly recommend this company.<//review>

<review>Sacha and his Staff were very professional in all of their dealings with me.  They provided the refinance of my principal residence.  I appreciate the input they allowed me to provide so that we were able to close my loan as they had agreed from our very first conversation.  Sacha took a personal interest in my specific needs and tailored his resources to make my loan happen even increasing the amount of funds needed to fit my changing requirements.  I heartily recommend them to anyone wanting a loan that wants to be treated fairly and professionally.  I will utilize their services again in the future.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

I am a mortgage broker. I just had one deal closed with Sacha's funding.  Source Capital funding  has good reasonable rate.  And Sacha means business.  He carried out what he promised. And he would take care the rest if he has too. He respects me and my business to him.  I was happy with the result.    I will contact  Source Capital Funding for my next deal.<//review>

I can't say enough about The Source Capital Team. Ryan Burns is truly a fantastic person to work with. He is efficient, extremely friendly and responsive. When there are a lot of choices for lenders to use, sometimes it can be challenging knowing who to go with, however Ryan stands out from the crowd. As soon as I met him I could tell his authenticity and how much he genuinely cares about his business and taking care of his clients. 5 Stars all the way! Thanks Ryan and Source Capital Team!< /Review>

I am relatively new to the world of private money lending and approached Source Capital with many questions. Sacha was both patient and thorough, and took as much time as necessary to answer all of my questions. Those initial conversations gave me comfort about the honesty, professionalism, and integrity of Sacha and his team. Since then, Source Capital has successfully closed two investment loans for me. I have found the entire staff at Source Capital, and at Red Leaf Management, to be friendly, honest, professional and efficient. I highly recommend them.< /text>

<Review>I wanted to do cash out refinance on my home as I was looking to expand my family business. I called Source Capital I talked to Sacha Ferranti and told him what I wanted to do. I told him my credit was not good as it showed a foreclosure a year ago. I asked him if it was possible to get cash out refinance with my credit. Sacha told me he was the lender, he also told me not to worry that he will get me approved within 24 hours. He was amazing; and I had a commitment before the end of the day. I was not aware of any title issues on my property until they pulled a preliminary title.

This was becoming the loan for hell, with all the title problems, the foreclosure, my low credit score and my lack of income. Sacha was a tremendous help me and was very proactive, one by one he cleared all the problems. The loan would have funded in 10 days as he had promised, but because of the title problems we had to wait until title had cleared the issues. Every time a new problem popped Sacha was there letting me know that he would solve it for me. He kept telling me not to worry and that everything would be fine.

I am happy to say, my loan funded on September 5, 2017. I personally was in the mortgage loan origination business for over 35 years. I have seen many difficult loans and have funded many tough loans myself.  Sacha was truly professional, and made a very tough loan run smoothly, I truly believe that this loan would not have funded if not for Sacha and “Source Capital”. Thank you very much Sacha, you were great and I will recommend you to everyone I know.<//Review>< Pics>

It was suggested that I look at the use of hard money lenders to quickly acquire funds needed to financially reposition our company for our next move.  I was fortunate to have contacted Ryan and his company.  They were very understanding, helpful and able to close on the funding quickly.  Any questions I had were answered promptly so that I was better able to understand the process.  They were very easy to work with and I enjoyed a very positive experience with Source Capital.</Review>

I lucked out when I found this company.  As a new business owner, I wasn't experienced enough to plan out everything I was going to encounter and when I found myself in need of help, I called Source Capital Funding, Inc.  It turned out to be the best decision because not only did Ryan Burns educate me on how the industry works, but he was warm and empathetic which made the process easy to go through.  I totally expected a cold, business-like process, but his manner and the assistance I received from his assistant, Marie Gleason, put me at ease super quick.  I would totally recommend this company to anyone who finds themselves in a position where they need help with the utmost discretion.  Thanks guys!<//review>

Recently completed another flawless re-fi transaction with Ryan & Sacha.  Why would anyone go to anyone else?  They're the best!

As an experienced real estate broker in the Bay Area, Sacha is my new 'go to' guy for private lending.  After dealing with three different private lenders who failed to perform for my Buyers on their new home purchase, Sacha saved the deal - and delivered exactly what he promised, when promised.  His focus on customer service is a 10+.  He's now on my speed dial.  Don't hesitate to use Source Capital.  They deserve more than 5 stars!< /Text>

Thank you Ryan and Marie. You made the loan process as easy as 123.
I was so pleased with the honest, efficient and professional service. Fastest funding I have ever received. I will highly recommend them for anyone in need of a loan.< /review>

<resp>None</resp><review>We have tried various traditional lenders to only end up being told we either needed to be living in the house or have 12 months good mortgage history. Well the house was forced into probate a month after my father's death. It was there for 7 months. In that time it got behind. My mother has an apartment and wanted to fix up the house for my son and I. It would be safer for him having a locked yard to play in being special needs. Yet over and over we were told no.

It came down to the wire where money was running out paying a mortgage and rent. One more month would have been detrimental. Sacha and his staff saved the day and the house dad had fought two wars for.  My son is scheduled to have his first backyard Oct. 1st. Thank you Sacha, Maria and especially Valerie at Fidelity for taking all my calls. Thank YOU Sacha for always replying to my emails and also taking my calls. I am very protective of my mother and you guys understood and respected that. You all are Godsent. Thank you again.</review>< userid>

As a first time borrower I was not quite sure what to expect. To say the least, I had a lot of questions. I quickly discovered that Source Capital funding had the answers. Honest answers. I was able to work directly with the lender who made it a point to make sure that I received the best loan for my personal project and situation. Source capital funding is made up of a team of people who worked diligently in my behalf. They were always available to answer my questions, emails and phone calls. I would highly recommend Source Capital funding over any other lender. If you are looking for a smooth transaction from a company that you can trust, Source Capital funding is the way to go. Thank You!< /Review>

This was the second time I used the services of Source Capital.  The service exceeded my high expectations based upon my first loan.   I recommend all whom are in need of business purposes loans to consider contacting Source Capital and its founder and principal, Sacha Ferrandi.  You will be pleasantly surprised by the high degree of service and personal attention to detail.  Source Capital also makes loans in Arizona not just California.  Just contact them for details.

<review>Sacha and everyone at Source Capital were friendly, efficient, professional, and easy to work with. Due to circumstances of my own making, I was forced to use a hard money lender. The loan was explained in detail to me, and I knew exactly what I was getting in to. The only issues I had with the whole process were ones created by my bank and Sacha and Marie were very patient, understanding and helpful. I wish that doing business at my own banks were as easy and pleasant as dealing with Sacha and company. If I am in need of a hard money loan again, I will not hesitate to use Source Capital.<//review>< pics>

I would have loved the opportunity to write a rave review however, I was discriminated against and not even extended the courtesy to submit an application or go over the available loan programs. I sent in an inquiry after reading the great reviews and received a callback the following day. I was advised the program I sent the inquiry regarding was no longer available and I noted to the rep the program was listed on their website and inquired about the program which is now in place. I was abruptly asked for my address and firmly advised I was not eligible to receive any information regarding loan programs due to inquiry for the program which is no longer available. Being in the real estate industry 20 years I knew this was very strange to refuse or deter a customer from applying or discussing loan programs and again requested information. I was then advised " This would be very expensive capital". I have received training for years on various types of discrimination however, never thought I would experience it first hand. I thanked the rep and ended the call feeling the void of being treated equally as a customer. Very unfortunate.</text>

{'time': 1538510470947, 'text': 'As the owner, I am immediately responding to this negative review as I think this individual is being somewhat aggressive with their words- especially as it pertains to being "discriminated against".   This firm, as stated on our website and the form this individual completed, only funds loans secured by real estate for business purposes only.   To say that you were "abruptly asked" about your address is harsh.  As an asset based lender, our focus is solely on the purpose of the loan and the real estate being pledged as collateral for the loan.  This is the main reason we ask for the address to the property.  To say that you were not "eligible to receive information" is completely erroneous and false.   We pride ourselves on educating ALL clients so they are aware of what programs we offer and don\'t offer so they are informed about all aspects of our business.  Because you did not qualify for our loan means nothing more than that.  To make an attempt to cast a negative light on this firm because you did not fit into our lending criteria is in very poor taste.  Our reputation speaks for itself and we will not allow for the general public to not be informed about the facts.  In this case, the facts speak for themselves.'}</resp>

<Text>I was in need of pulling some equity out of an investment property. Ryan at Source Capital was very helpful and patient explaining the options for a hard money loan. Once I settled on the loan/terms that best fit my needs, Ryan guided me through the process to closing. The whole thing took less than two weeks start-to finish. Very pleased and I would look to them again as a borrower or an investor.</Text>< pics>

I definitely recommend them to anyone and will use them again myself!

UPDATE - Jhoybell in their office has been very helpful with some admin issues that popped up during the servicing of my loan.  Resolved quickly and in a very professional manner.<//Review>

Highly recommend this company if you need money fast and you value efficiency.  I received a commitment to fund within 5 days of my initial contact and received funding within 3 weeks of beginning my search.  Sacha Ferrendi contacted me within 2 days and that was over a holiday weekend.  Staff was efficient and communicated well about all paper work needed.   Everyone worked diligently to tie all loose ends and  finalize the funding.   Will go back to them again if I need funding in the future.< /text>

A completely professional yet friendly environment. Had never done financial transactions
long distance before but i am quite glad i did. Ryan as a partner in the firm, dealt with me
directly and then turned me over to Marie who was amazingly knowledgeable about actually
getting it done; a real professional. I would and probably will deal with them again and I recommend
them heartily.</Text>

Source Capital is a first rate operation; bought an investment property in Big Bear and needed to close in 30 days. All major lending firms wanted strict FNMA guidelines, 6-8 weeks out of state processing and underwriting. What a mess they have made out of lending, and I have excellent credit. I contacted Sacha at Source Capital and they made the whole process really easy. I was approved and ready to go in about two weeks. This was my first experience using a "hard money" lender, it won't be my last. I highly recommend this company.< /text>

Sacha and Company were as professional and helpful as you could ask. He was always available, knowledgeable, and provided great customer service. As a lender myself, working with someone like him shows that there are still a lot of good people in our industry, and we will definitely be in connection to do future business together. Job well done.< /review>

I have had over a half dozen of transaction with Source Capital Funding, and our company experience keeps getting and smoother in every new transaction. Ryan, and the rest of staff don't spare any efforts to get our financing done within proposed budget and on time every time. We are so glad to finally find an excellent lender to partner with in our real estate projects.<//Review>

We have closed multiple loans with these guys over the past five years and have had mostly good experiences. However, they recently stuck us with an almost $2000 bill over the fine print on a refi transaction that was not required. The loan was never closed and they still got paid. We expected better service from a longtime business partner. A win-win approach to business is not a primary value of this company. Buyer beware.</review>

{'time': 1501619082413, 'text': 'As the owner of the firm, I am responding to Mr. Willis directly as I personally handled this transaction.  As such, the executed Agreement clearly states what constitutes this firm earning a fee if the borrower does not perform.  In this case, the borrower signed the Agreement which allowed us to engage in the underwriting and funding of the loan.  During the process, the borrower made the decision, not this firm, to not move forward for their own personal reasons.  At that point, per the Agreement and our normal protocol, he was promptly charged the fee, which was paid with no questions or concerns.  I am quoting directly from his email when he states "I understand there are some costs involved from Source Capital. In this case only, would you be willing to lower the doc prep fee."  I even went so far as to offer to reduce the fee the next time we did business over half the amount as a gesture of good will.\n\nTo state that Mr. Willis was "stuck with a bill" over fine print is false.  As Mr. Willis has closed multiple loans with this firm, which we appreciate very much, I would think that one would be familiar with our process and the "fine print" mentioned.  I am sorry the borrower is unhappy and felt the need to leave a negative review but the Agreement signed is fair and was a result of the borrowers failure to perform as agreed.   John, I wish you the best of luck with what you are doing but it is evident we are not a good fit for business.  I take these comments very seriously and it is not fair to shed this firm in a negative light because of your sole decision to not move forward.'}</resp>

I am so confident in Sacha Ferrandi and his team that I have encouraged family members and friends to invest as well. If you are seeking a low risk, high return investment opportunity with a company that is conservative, up to date on compliance issues and conducts extremely thorough underwriting, Source Capital Funding is an excellent choice.

I'd like to sincerely thank Sacha Ferrandi and Marie Gleason for a thorough, quick and simple processing of my recent loan. Like many consumers, I was hesitant to apply for a "hard money" loan due to the fees involved.  However, I found myself mistaken and the costs reasonable and affordable with no need to come up with out of pocket money to close. As a single mom facing financial challenges, family losses and health issues within a short time period, Sasha worked diligently with me to help resolve my immediate funding issues even though my loan was small. I highly recommend Source Capital Funding to any person/business in need of a quick loan, and in my situation having only property equity to secure funds. Thank you for helping me through a very difficult time - greatly appreciated.<//text>

Just closed a loan with Source Capital and the process was streamlined, efficient and easy!   Sacha stepped in last minute to help close a deal that didn't work out with a different lender.

<Review>To whom it may Concern:

We recently reached out to Source-Capital to procure financing for a building owned by a client of mine dealing with a messy probate situation.  An 8-year probate nightmare with numerous lawyers and a myriad of unresolved issues.  Little did I know, there were more significant challenges that we would need to overcome along the way.

Sacha was most helpful from the beginning of the process all the way to the end.  It was obvious we were more than just another deal to be closed.  Source Capital really cared about what my client was going through.

Sacha helped my client arrive at a realistic assessment of the value of their property while providing various options fulfilling specialized requests.

Because of his advice and direction, a potentially turbulent file has been delicately maneuvered through the minutiae of requisite Court approvals and various Title issues.

All in all, Sacha and his team have been very knowledgeable about the whole process of obtaining financing and everything was explained in detail, step-by-step.

Sacha always took my phone calls when we had questions or needed clarification. Irregardless of the query, we had an answer which allowed us to move forward.

I would be remiss not to mention Jhoybell, who pleasantly answers the phone giving assistance, direction and encouragement when needed.  Her service was impeccable and her warmth and genuine interest in our file was very much appreciated.

We might have never been able to pull this off without Sacha and the Source Capital team.  They are true professionals.

I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend these guys PERIOD!

THANKS AGAIN!<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>Source Capital Funding does what it advertises. They are a time sensible equity based hard money lender that will deliver a decision on a hard money scenario within hours of submission, fund and close within next few days. No games, no lengthy underwriting, no multiple request for additional conditions.
If you need to close fast with no games, I strongly suggest source capital and Sacha Ferrandi.<//text>< Response>

From my experience, Sacha (owner of source capital) is a very passionate and conscientious person to work with.  His heart is in the right place and he can be trusted when it comes to getting you the money you need, but also in life in general.

It's the "life in general" part that means to most to me.  If you are a good person fundamentally, then your services are likely to be high quality too.< /Text>

I worked with Sacha Ferrandi to help him with two assets.  I worked with him through the pre-foreclosure, then listing the properties for sale, and then two successful closings!  It was a pleasure to work with Sacha and Source Capital Funding!</text>

After being turned down for a loan twice, me and my husband weren't very optimistic about being able to get one from anybody. However, I googled private lenders and found Source Capital Funding. Not only did we get our money within days of doing the paperwork, the paperwork was brought to my house over the weekend, which was very convenient due to a busy work schedule, and it made the process go quicker. Also, there was never a time when I couldn't get in touch with anybody and they were always eager to help and willing to offer their experience to better our own business! We are VERY happy with their service and I totally recommend them to anybody needing their financial services! I also want to thank Sacha Ferrandi for all his advice and helping me with all the questions I had! Thank you!</text>

Honest and Flexible!  I strongly recommend Sacha in Source Capital Lending with whom I have worked several times. Sacha is very honest -- the fees and interest rate are very reasonable for a HML, and there are no annoying and expensive fees and points beyond what is initially discussed. Further, Sacha is flexible and helped a lot when I needed his help when converting his HML loan to a conventional loan with one of the traditional lenders. He does not charge prepayment penalties and did not give me any hurdles when I refinanced his loan with the other lender. Further, at another occasion when I refinanced his loans in house, his points for the refinance were also very reasonable. Sacha gets the job done quickly, and I know I can always count on him when there is a good investment opportunity and I need the cash quickly.<//Review>

This is the first time I decided to use hard money loan and after some research, I decided to try Source Capital.  My experience with them has been terrific, they were very professional, answered and explain all my questions, and I will definitely use them for my future hard money option.  Sacha is the partner that worked with me from day 1 and I highly recommend his company.<//review>

I worked in mortgage over a twenty-year period, in everything from loan servicing to underwriting so I understand many aspects of the business. For me, this type of loan was a first and a tough decision but really the only option in my particular circumstance. Ryan, is great, he listens well and is very patient. We had long discussions about all my concerns and never did I feel pressured or get the sense that he was annoyed at having to answer my questions. He's very professional. Marie was my processor. She was very polite and helpful. Overall the entire process was exceptional, quick and very easy. I'll be passing their information along to two of my long time real estate agent partners for referrals and will most definitely consider them as a funding source for future business.

I brought a "challenging" file, reverse 1031 exchange,  to Sacha at Source Capital 10 days ago. Sacha and his team were able to get the loan funded thus saving my clients purchase transaction and more importantly saving his tax exemption for the 1031 exchange. I appreciate, as did my client, the swift and professionalism Sacha and his team provided.</Review>

I have worked with Sacha Ferrandi and Source Capital for over two years.
Their products are services are second to none in the private money realm.
If you are looking for a credible, knowledgeable and honest team then look no further.
Source Capital is my preferred choice for Private Money loans.< /review>

<Review>I have been a customer of Source Capital Funding since 2011.
To begin, they helped me in an urgent time of need.  They provided me with assistance in obtaining a mortgage when my credit would not allow for any traditional loans.  Not only did they come through with a very fair interest rate, they also helped me close in 2 weeks!
Now, after 3 years of providing me with outstanding service, they have gone the extra mile to renew my loan and take a world of worries off my shoulders.
I would HIGHLY recommend them to anyone looking for assistance.  They have been nothing short of amazing.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>*** UPDATE ***
Here's a copy of the infamous email:

"
Silvio –

I left you a VM regarding this matter (see attached).  Please call me ASAP to discuss your intentions.   If I do not hear from you, we will commence foreclosure proceedings April 2, 2017.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Ryan
"

NOTE: The VM was left less than 30 minutes before the email arrived in my inbox.

I don't have an issue with being notified that the balloon payment due date is coming soon. My problem was with the language.

I do appreciate Ryan's email on 8/2/2017 admitting the unneeded use of the term "foreclosure" and apologizing for it, but after reading the response below I'm not so sure it was a genuine rectification.

=== ORIGINAL REVIEW ===
At the beginning the process was fast and easy.
No issues throughout the period of the loan until March 8, 2017, 24 days before its maturity, when I get a very distasteful email asking to "discuss my intentions" and that foreclosure proceedings will commence on Sunday, April 2, 2017, the very next day after the balloon payment was due. Well, that is common knowledge. But what is really upsetting is that I  was never, ever late with any monthly payment and had already paid approximately 60% of the principal when that email arrived like a slap in my face.
In my opinion that sort of language was completely unnecessary and the only outcome of it was my change in opinion about this company.
Friendly advice: you shouldn't ever mention foreclosing a property before you can actually do it. Much less mention it to someone with a pristine payment record as mine.</Review>< Pictures>

<Resp>{'time': 1501618276706, 'text': '*UPDATE* I believe that the entire chain of emails is relevant to what transpired. On March 8, 2017, after you responded, we wrote: "Silvio –You are correct. The loan is not due until April 1st. I just wanted to give you a courtesy call. Good to hear it will be taken care of. Thank you for the quick response. Let me know if you need anything. I am here to help."\nI am not sure how these responses are not "genuine" but I believe it shows we do care and take these matters seriously.  It is unfortunate to receive a negative review but it is your opinion and you have that right.  We are confident that the hundreds of positive reviews we have received and our A+ rating with the BBB truly reflect this company and the services we provide.\n\nAs one of the two principals of the company, I am responding to this from Mr. Belini.  As a licensed lender, we are required to provide a "Balloon Payment Notice" not less than 90 nor more than 150 days before the balloon payment is due, regardless of the borrower\'s payment history.  In this case, we did not hear from the client and went above and beyond the normal scope of what is required and provided another reminder via email.  As we keep all correspondence on file for 5 years, I have a copy of the email and to state that this was "very distasteful" is simply not true..  The fact is that the borrower was notified on more than one occasion that the loan was coming due and we simply needed a response to see if the borrower wanted to extend or what their intentions were.  Mentioning the word "foreclosure" when a balloon payment due is standard legal language that must be utilized per law.  To take offense to such language is an issue that should be taken up with the legislators that govern the laws of lending.  All we did was follow the book on what is required.  To leave a negative review because we went out of our way to notify you of your loan coming due is not fair.'}</Resp><Rating>1<//Rating><Gmap_id>0x80dbf72ba5c0fa41:0x6fd1a9dea83779ea< /Gmap_id></record>

I did extensive research on a private money lending and after a lot homework chose source capital because of their awesome service ryan was great from start to finish with the loan and best of all he was upfront with fees and had the lowest prices on their loan fees! This is the second time doing business with him. Now I dont need to look any further because I trust source capital now on any loan needs its like a having a trusted partner for life. I highly refer source capital< /Review>

We were in a bind with a home loan that fell through unexpectedly.  We researched various private money lenders, and we came across SCF.  Sasha and his team were fantastic to work with.  We had very little time to work with.  Sasha is a straight shooter and does what he says he going to do.  We had everything riding on his performance and he came through as promised.  Thank you SCF!  We are now loving being in our dream home.</text>

Source Capital helped me quickly, efficiently and with ease & grace through a difficult situation handling my brother's estate.  I appreciate their thoughtfulness & compassion in a market that is prone to be more self-serving.  Thank you, Source Capital!</review>

<Text>I called Sacha Ferrandi on October 2, 2014 to inquire if I could get a loan on a condominium in San Diego, California that I own that had no mortgage.  I advised him that I needed the money to pay the IRS and California Franchise Tax Board 2013 taxes that were due October 15, 2014.  With has expert help and guidance, we were able to complete the process over the internet and very quickly.  I was able to pay my taxes on time.  Thanks, Sacha.  You were a life saver!  Jerel L.

This is a regular spot for me. I get cheese steak & chicken/ cheese with easy onions. Then I go halfsies with my son so we each enjoy a little of both. We love the pickle bar... every bite must have pickles in my book.</review>

< review>
First time eating at this place. The inside was clean, the employees were friendly, but I have two issues with this restaurant in Monrovia, CA.
1. There was a tall man who wears glasses and was a identified to me as one of the "owners", he was handling the bread with his bare hands, then would touch his nose, stuff trash into a trash can and immediately go back to handling the bread and put it on the grill. I brought this to the attention of one of the employees and he went and told him that I said he needs to wear gloves and to stop touching his face and trash. The "owner" went to the back and got more bread...and nothing changed! Still touching food with bare hands! He is a very poor example to his employees!!!
2. When I got my order home, I was missing one of my cheese steak sandwiches. I ordered 4 and only received 3. This might not have been a big deal if I lived only a few blocks away, but I drove over 5 miles, from El Monte.
Very disappointing!
Although, I must admit, the sandwiches and cheese fries were very good and I hope I didn't get one of the sandwich that were handled by the owner!
One other thing, I couldn't find this store's report card from the L.A. County Health Dept. It is supposed to be displayed in plain view!< /review>

I think this place was much better before it was under new ownership. I've been here twice they were bought out, and the quality of food has dropped quite a bit< /review>

This place is the best! Best cheesesteaks this side of Philadelphia. I'm a cheesesteak fanatic and have been all over the world eating cheesesteaks: New York, Chicago, and all over Philly: Pats, Ginos, Jims, you name it. For a Southern California joint, this place gives the real Philadelphia cheesesteak shops a run for their money. But I would stick with the classic: steak, onions, peppers, and American (or cheese wiz if you like it like the original in Philly). Skip the chicken, or other California variants. The rolls are just right: chewy and soft. And of the 5th, 15th, and 25th of each month, they offer all cheesesteak sandwiches for $5, the 5on5 deal. Can't beat that!< /text>

Overpriced for average food. Their condiment bar was messy, pickles dried out and no ketchup for fries. Not coming back.< /Text>

Can be a little pricey at times, but if you come on 5 15 or 25 of every month the sandwiches are cheaper and are just as good!<//text>

I've used Quality Windows numerous of times for screen repairs on my properties.  They really did a solid job for me, getting my window "inspection ready," when I originally hired an outside contractor who was doing everything incorrectly. Their office staff is very friendly and extremely helpful. Anthony, at the front desk always acknowledges me by name every time I walk in, which is very nice. I highly suggesting going to Quality Windows for any of your windows or glass needs.< /Text>

<rate>1<//rate><review>We used this place to install glass inserts to newly painted cabinet doors for our custom kitchen remodel. They treated our cabinet doors carelessly, not taking the normal care you would expect and they were returned with scratches, dirt, dings, gouges and wood damage, all which have to be repaired. When I spoke to the manager Joey about my dissatisfaction and a way to rectify the issue , he referred to their blanket policy that they are not responsible for damage incurred when the products are in their possession. I told him I understand if a little dirt or light scuffing happens but the damage is much more than expected with normal careful handling. Boo. I do not recommend this place. I would never use them again and I hope no one else has an issue like this. Go elsewhere.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

These guys were amazing! Anthony hooked us up immediately with a boardup and slider installation after a break-in. Very reliable and very quick. No need to search further. Will definitely come back for more! Thanks Anthony!<//Review>

They are very friendly and do good work for reasonable prices. Their systems are a little a slow, so I recommend you take that into account when planning a trip there. This is my second experience with them and I will continue to use them.</text>

<review>Larry Salinas, from Quality Windows and Doors came out today and installed 4 By-Pass Sliding doors in our bedrooms and halls.
I have been in the construction and repair business for 30 years and I can say without a doubt, that Mr. Salinas was extremely professional, dedicated, reliable, trustworthy and very attentive to all my wife’s questions. He did an outstanding job. He had to do some extra work to retrofit the doors and did so without hesitation.  All around he did an excellent job. He cleaned up and vacuumed the work area before he left. We are 100% satisfied with his superb work. We highly recommend Larry Salinas and his company Quality Windows and Doors. Thanks again Mr. Salinas for your outstanding work ethics.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

I had my windows installed end of may and was very impressed with the company and employees. Installers did a great clean job. I used to do construction work and was impressed with quality and how clean the job was. I had new construction windows installed meaning they had to cut stucco back and the cut drywall and my wooden  ledge inside. They made clean cuts that all it took was some caulking. I didn't have to fix anything as i was preparing myself to do. It took them little longer then they expected but they accommodate to make sure everything was done before my stucco guy came to fix around windows. They were recommended to me by a good friend and i would highly recommend them to anybody else. I had a great experience.<//text>

<Text>Windows came out great! Very clean. Installers were professional. Office personnel need better training in organizational skills, communication, and following up on orders so they are installed as scheduled. No one called us one time that are order was back ordered. The installer dropped bomb on us they day before scheduled install. No one still to this day has ever called us to reschedule or give any updates on delivery of door. Been over a month now & no door. We tried to cancel but all the sudden this missing door has arrived and we cant cancel. We had a scheduled install date. Who wants a door after a month went by?? Poor customer service.< /Text>< time>

Quality Windows Oxnard did a marvelous job installing windows for my mother.  They explained the process, measured well, installed superbly and offered excellent financing options.  Staff couldn't have been more professional or nicer. The windows make a huge difference in the appearance of the home. My favorite thing is the new sliding door. It rolls so smoothly along its tracks that I don't need to strain my back opening it. So happy! Thanks very much!< /text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>I purchased Tuscany windows from Quality Windows & Door and had them installed by their in-house crew.  They offered me the best price compare to the other vendors in my area.  The installation crew were able to finish 8 Windows and 2 Slider doors in one day complete with the trimming and framing for the slider doors.   Thank you Oscar and crew for doing a great job on the installation.   I should also thank Mark, Mike and Berenice for their help and professionalism in getting my order in.   I still have an Ultra door that is on order which will be installed in couple of weeks.   I am ordering shower doors from them and I have all the confidence that I will be happy with that as well.   I will update my review after the shower doors are installed to keep you updated. I am looking forward for another good experience this vendor.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

They came and showed us the windows (no hard sell ...a shout out to Mark)
They gave us a price that was reasonable, then had the windows and sliders built in the exact amount of time they told us it would take (5 weeks)...then installed in 2 days which i thought was great. They were clean and professional. An all around terrific job.!< /Text>

<text>They came out to fix the ribbon on 2 Marvin windows. Said they would order the parts and would send an email quote that day and also for installing replacement double hung Fleetwood windows. Never heard a word! After 10 days I called back and the woman answering the phone said she would email me the quote immediately ... nothing. Not sure if they were giving me the bums rush or it really fell in a hole? Office staff needs some help? I am (was) a repeat customer. After I added this review Daisy (inside sales) called and asked what they could do to resolve the situation. They sent two guys to look over the Marvin windows sash problem again. They were quite courteous and ordered the sash parts. Unfortunately when a hard working Ernesto came back Marvin had revised their design and it didn't quite fit so he took one of my old sash parts to make sure that they got the right Marvin parts in, he returned and presto both of my double hung front windows work great! Thanks to the responders for getting the problem solved.  If you have trouble with the person who answers the phone ask for an inside sales representative!< /text><rating>4</rating><gmap_id>0x80e84e91b9921c67:0xa3c9c6335e57dd61</gmap_id><date>1487731989960< /date><response>None< /response>< Pics>

Awesome experience from start to finish!  From the first phone call to Erick, until the final touch on the installation by Alex, it was a pleasure to work with such a friendly, knowledgeable team.  I purchased a fixer-upper and knew absolutely nothing about windows.  I did a lot of research, and chose Quality Windows because of their great product, very reasonable prices and the incredible customer service I received.   Three stars is not enough!  Closet doors are the next project and I guarantee I will be using Erick and his team!<//Text>

Quality Windows made it easy and affordable for me to replace some of the windows in my home!  Erick and his staff are professional and efficient, which I appreciate, and easy to work with. Plus they were worked around my busy schedule!

I also appreciate the contemporary styles they offe, making it easy to compliment the architecture of my home and the various ideas they were able to offer.

Thanks Quality Windows!  You definitely have the right name!<//Review>

I purchased a shower door bottom sweep for 1/2" thick glass.  When I went home and tried to slide it on it wouldn't fit.  I measured the width of the inside of the sweep and it was not 1/2".  The outside measurement was 1/2".  I took the sweep back to Quality Windows and after seeing the receipt saying the sweep was for 1/2" thick glass, they cut a new sweep.  I was able to put on shower door in 1 minute.<//Review>

<text>Very unprofessional.  I had this company replace a window and 2 screens. While they were out, I had them look at another problems with the windows dropping their balance bars. I was told the fix was to installed spacer blocks. So I had them order them and had the tech come back to install them. After 2 months 2 windows were doing the same thing. It took 3 weeks of back and forth calls to have them send a tech out. This was a five minute job and they charged me another $75.00 to have him go out and fix the problem. What a waste of  3 weeks of my time.  Back and forth phone calls. Put on hold, checking with manager, someone will call you back, ETC. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY FOR PIECE OF MIND! There are other window and door companies in this area, I wish I had not used this company as they are a ripped off, but I will never use them again.<//text>< pics>

I recently got new bypass/sliding shower doors from Quality Windows. The installers did a great job at removing my old shower and the new shower really made my bathroom look fresh and new. After showering, I simply use a small squeegee to maintain the glass and it still looks new. I would recommend Quality Windows to any one who wants fast installation and friendly service!!!!!!</review>

<Review>I live in Hueneme Bay and had new Milgard windows and patio door installed by Quality Windows 7 years ago. They all still work like a charm and look as nice as the day they were installed. All my neighbors always comment about how nice they look, so I am happy to refer them to Quality Windows at any time. I remember the installers were all so friendly and cleaned up after themselves. I am very satisfied with the Windows and the service they provided.</Review>< username>

I am a "do-it-yourself 'er" and did product and price comparisons with other local window/glass & door shops as well as the big box stores and I found the staff here at Quality Windows to be very knowledgeable, helpful and friendly even when I called them constantly for advice in the do-it-yourself installation of my purchase.
My second experience with Quality Windows was for a custom entry door and hardware that I had them install because of the beauty of the door, I did not want to ruin it.
And finally, my third experience was for a 84 inch full enclosure glass shower which they installed. I get lot's of compliments on the products I've purchased from Quality Glass and everyone wants to know where I got them and who installed them, and I have no problem telling them; Quality Glass in Oxnard is where I found the best prices, products and service.   I AM VERY HAPPY!< /Review>< pics>

< review>
The last Spudnuts donut I had was over 20 years ago, and I had forgotten how good they are. We had a cake donut with chocolate frosting, and one raised with cinnamon crumb coating. The were both soo good. Fluffy, but not heavy and not greasy in any way. The cashier was friendly, and I highly recommend Spudnuts!<//review>

I tried the coffee, chocolate with peanuts, and their white glazed with sprinkles. Everything was good, and tasted fresh and crispy. This place is also great if you are on a budget; you can grab a quick dessert or something to have with your coffee in the morning.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPk8VFBA3Os36Q4JeIidfeNhy1I7yBmRDFpAmpf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPI7w9nfwdO62ZlaO3LPYd23VbLplh-SNZuSD7v=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOkuMJRb-PoP8MCKw5gKOdl30MqAD2rzC9JcFWC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< gmap_id>

Spudnuts Donuts is one of my favorite places, is very cozy to me, I can spend some time drinking a cup of coffee with my favorite donuts, the place is very nice and clean, prices are excellent and the menu have a nice variety of options and costumer service is exceptional, they're always happy and polite and no matter what time of the day I visit them, there's always a big smile and wonderful greeting besides that I love Donuts 🍩☕🍪🍶</text>

Omg. That was so worth waiting 25 years for! I hadn't had a spudnut since I lived in Ventura many moons ago. That crumb was so delicious! Nice guy behind the counter. Thank you!<//review>

The best donuts I've ever had in my life! Not even Voodoo donuts in Portland compares, seriously. Always fresh, delicious and the perfect texture. Also, the people who run this shop (I'm pretty sure it's family owned) are so incredibly nice, they make me feel so welcome and happy to be there. Give these people your money, they deserve it and you definitely won't regret it!!!< /Text>

He followed up on me to make sure everything was fine. I highly recommend getting your tire services done with Cubano tires Mobile shop.

Great service! I have used Cubano tires in the past when I needed all 4 tires replaced. They came to my location and did the work while my car was at home. Yesterday my daughter got stuck with a flat tire and I couldn't get out to her location to help her. Cubano tires responded within an hour. Joel found a bubble on another tire and said her tires were in bad shape. He was able to replace all 4 tires for a great price and got her back on the road in under an hour! I made sure all my family has Cubano tires phone number, especially those with teenage drivers.<//review>

< Review>
I was recommended to Cubano Tires Mobile Shop by my coworker Mike. Said nothing but good things about how he has been using them for years. He said one time that he was stuck on the rode and Joel came out to fix it right away. I have been looking to get tires for my wife’s and my car for some time now and wanted to give them a shot. Joel has super competitive pricing and a wide variety of tires to choose from. Whatever your budget, he has them. The best part is that he comes to you and there is no need to wait hours upon hours at a shop. When I set up an appointment for 03/26/21 10AM, Joel and his assistant Armando was there right on the dot. He told me to go inside the house and wait while he got everything done. I later came outside around 1045 and both my vehicles were already done. Two cars with all four tires replaced and balanced in less then 45 min. I am amazed at the promptness, professionalism, courtesy, competitive pricing and hard honest work of Joel and Armando. They did such an amazing job that I will use them forever and definitely recommend to family and friends. Please, if you need tires give them a shot, you will not regret it.</Review>

<review>Wow! Incredible service! I was 20 miles from home, my tire hit something on the road a blew immediately, all tire shops were closed or about to close at around 8PM. My car has no spare so I did a quick google search for late night tire shop and Cubano Tires came up. I was expecting to pay an arm and a leg for the service and the tire itself, but not at all. Very reasonable price! The owner, Joel, got to me in under 45 minutes, and replaced my tire within 15 minutes. This company saved me a huge headache from having it towed, leaving it overnight somewhere, having to find a ride home, then finding a ride back to wherever it was towed too! Highly recommend! Thank you Joel!<//review>< Time>

They're a mobile shop and are flexible in where and when they can meet you. I was able to get my wheels and tires replaced at work. Service is professional, friendly, and quick. I highly recommend taking advantage of this convenient service.<//review>< pics>

Highly Recomended!!! I searched around for good tires and obviously looking for a good price. I then contacted Cubanos and immediately got a response. Not only did he beat pricing to alot of my local shops but he is also mobile so it was super easy! He answered all my questions and was on time wich is a big deal for me. I had brand new HRE wheels and was really worried abt any damage being done to the curb of the wheels during installation but Cubano did a amazing job the wheel was perfect! Very humble and great guy i highly recomend his work !!</Text>

I called late last night and was able to set up an appointment with Joel for the next day.  He was prompt and very friendly.  He even waited around until I came home from work as I ran a bit late.  He was able to swap out 4 tires on my wife’s car in no time.  The convenience of not having to call a tow truck and wait around at a shop after a longs days work was a blessing.  Thank you Joel for such a great experience and for making my day less stressful.<//review>

Wow,

That was amazing. Here and gone in 15 minutes........What was my alternative ?  Call AAA, have car towed to tire shop. Be told tire can't be fixed, buy new tire, well you really need two tires to be safe. Front end alignment, well you really should.............bottom line?  Your going to spend a lot more not calling Joel at Cubano Tires.....My new best friend!!!!!!!
Awesome person and even more awesome business ...

Last Saturday night my girlfriend had a blow out on her way to work. I took her to work and then dealt with the tire issue and this guy came in clutch.
I use to work as a tire tech and believe me when I say this guy knows what's he doing  for needing a tire at 8pm on a Saturday night. This guy is the best and he comes to you!!  Love this East Coast concept.
Very much Recommend him.< /Review>

<Review>Cubano Tires was a lifesaver!! I’m from the Bay Area, but drove down to southern Cali to visit my boyfriend when the worst happened while I was in town. One of my tires went completely flat! I was panicking because I obviously could not drive back home on a spare!! So in my search for a shop I found Cubano Tires. I was so surprised to find out it was a mobile shop. I didn’t even know that existed!! Gave them a call and Joel was amazing! His service was top notch and the price was more then reasonable. Trust me, coming from the Bay Area where they charge an arm a leg, how I wish this mobile shop could be in my area. I definitely recommend this mobile shop to anyone. Plus, this all got better as Joel agreed to meet me at a mall to work on my car while I shopped!!<//Review>< pictures>

Joel is a pro! Called looking for a quote on tires after my front driver side tire have out. Joel made figuring out what I needed simple and managed to get me a quote well below what I was expecting. Was even more blown away to find out that I didn't need to find a way to get my immobile car to a shop for a repair, Cubano came right to me. Thanks for getting me back on the road.<//review>

Best tire mobile service in Orange County. I had a freak accident happen at 11 at night on the 605. Cars nowadays don’t come with spare tires which is stupid but apparently “reduces weight and saves fuel efficiency” so I had to do some searching online on the side of the freeway because my roadside assistance w/ my insurance doesn’t replace tires on the spot with brand new tires. I called this place up 30 mins before they closed at 12 AM and they sent a guy out to me under less than an hour and half. This was so convenient for me because I didn’t have to get towed to a shop and wait till the morning. If you ever need help immediately call this place up. They saved me from a headache.</text>

I was going to Glamis and I needed a tire for my toyhauler. Cubano came through!  Trailer tires are 10 ply range E and are not easily located especially with mobile shops.  The process was fast!  Definitely recommend!< /text>

I called cubano tires and the worker's name was Joel. He was very professional. He came to my house and it was awesome that I didnt have to leave the comfort of my own home.  The cubano work truck is equipped very professional! All his equipment was professional looking! I was iffy about it since it is a mobile van! But I'm soo glad I called him up! I will definitely call back to service my car again!</text>

< Review>
I walked into your shoe palace location today in Claremont CA. The Service I got was Amazing! I really would like to give credit where credit is due! MGR On Duty Jennifer, & Associate Dajanae, went out of their way to help assist me. They showed me a few different new styles, & offered some shoe care products as well. But their Customer Service was A 10+! Just wanted to take the time to say Thank You to them & I will definitely be back, & refer my friends and family as well. Thanks Again Girls! 😬🙏🏻

<review>Smallish location compared to others, with a lot of equipment neatly packed in. What stood out was the service, which was friendly and not too intimidating. It’s been a while since I’ve been in a gym for a formal workout and expected some meathead to look down on my lack of physicality :). A steady, the people up front looked “normal” enough and didn’t have that gym rat mentality. They definitely tried to up sell services, but were not pushy. Funniest thing was it took some time to figure out the Bike and weight machines. Pedal power for the bike to start the time (who knew) and different settings along with traditional pins for the weight machines. Oh how things have changed.

Anyway off for my first workout in a gym in 20 years and left after about an hour and a half. Leg and arms are a bit sore today but looking forward to a few more sessions. I definitely prefer being outdoors, biking, golfing or swimming but this is a good alternative for the winter months. Pretty good deal for two years at Costco too.<//review>< Date>

Super friendly employees and the gym is mad clean. Might be the best active location I've ever been to... but a 24 hour fitness that closes, whaaaa???< /review>

rating is based on weekend times between: 1-4 pm and weekdays between 5-6 am

variety of weight training equipment: B
number of treadmills: A+
number of stairclimbers: A+
age of machines: C
gym hygiene: A 3-4 cleaning stations
Parking: A+
Locker Room (men): B
the showers are single stalled but open, so dont expect too much privacy. otherwise its clean.
staff: a little less social than other 24 hr fitnesses
number of water fountains: 3 good water pressure

bottom line: highly recommend this gym if u dont wanna stress about parking, and access to a threadmill.</review>

I only go here since its close to my home.  Given how high dues are, management should prioritize fixing equipment.  Its kind of sad.<//review>

The front desks are usually nice and friendly... Until my gym membership from Costco expired. I brought in my new Costco membership, I was turned away by the girl saying that I can no longer use that promotion and it's for new members only. Thank goodness I have a friend who's a club manager at 24 which I was informed that's NOT TRUE so yes, you can renew your Costco membership, don't allow them to turn you away like they did to me. I'm just gona activate mine online. I get that it's probably part of their jobs but this just leaves a bad customer experience in my book. Hopefully this doesn't happen to anyone else.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Your treadmills are dangerous, they tend to abruptly stop. If it wasn't for that I would give this gym 5 stars and it closes 🤔< /text>

It's ok, most of the machines are outdated and it closes at 11:59 which sucks for me because my work schedule is hectic and it's right next to my house so I have to drive 15-20 mins to the next one.<//text>

<review>Came to this location in the past and I was seriously bothered by the lighting at this place.   It was a weird color like too much orange or yellow.  Yea call me weird or whatever but that makes a difference for me.  I haven't been back since but who knows maybe they changed out the lights by now.< /review><gmapID>0x80c329eff6bae3c1:0xa467a4b20eb772e2<//gmapID>< Pics>

<Text>Had a confirmation number for a insurance vehicle to be picked up and the rep from the Salinas office had no vehicles to give me. They told me they wouldn't have anything today but can give me a spot tomorrow. She looked for a spot in their Monterey office and booked one today after 4 pm. Now this is where the bad rating coming into play... I called Monterey to see if I could get an upgrade on the insurance claim. They acted like they were in too much of a rush to help me. Then I just said I will call Salinas after being put on hold for a couple of times for a long period of time. When calling the rep (I think her name was Jay) she said somethings that I didn't like about them not having an upgrade and that they wouldn't have an upgrade but what I was disappointed in was the lack of care, she has for the situation and the lack of wanting to go over and beyond for the customer. You just don't see that anymore... I will see how things go today with picking up the vehicle... To be concluded...</Text>< Pictures>

<review>Do not rent in this place. This office has a terrible  comunication. The information  provided in this  offices contradicts  the 0800 customer support. In adition I feel that  having this car made me be untrusted.  They made present  the car in order to have an extention that finally they rejected.  If you want to have nasty surprises  this is your place.<//review>< Pics>

< Review>
Frustrating and very disappointing experience renting a car for my 22 year old granddaughter at this location in Monterey, CA. Plane was delayed and rental office was closed at 6pm so she was told to return the next morning, only to find out they would not release the car to her even though it had been paid in full, and she presented a debit card with enough funds to cover the required hold. I had spoken with a Hertz agent when the reservation was made to make sure her debit card would qualify and was told yes it would. The agent in Monterey was rude to her and not at all helpful, extremely poor customer service! Hertz refused to refund the charge for the car. I will NEVER, ever use Hertz again and I would not recommend this location for anyone else!< /Review>

Not happy at all, there machine wouldn't take my card due to issues on there end so we're asked to come back later when the manager is there to come back and him be very rude and not even try to help us! I would suggest trying one of the other rental spots and hopefully you will get better customer service.< /Text>

Complete scam. Brought vehicle back with a full tank of gas and they sneakily charged me $46 in refueling charges. Oh, and the vehicle had 40,000 miles on it and had multiple maintenance alerts constantly going off. This place is a joke.</review>

The manager Cecilia here is terrible. She interrupted me every other word and was refusing to let me explain what my situation was before blaming me for it. I had called six times to verify after hours pickup info. Once before making the reservation which is why I made the reservation in the first place. The other six times they confirmed my info and the fact that they have after hours pickup. Long story short I called before my connecting flight and the lady said she was leaving at closing and had no record of my reservation or info. I was left stranded even after having called six times prior to my actual travel date. Cecilia ended up hanging up on me because I politely asked her to stop interrupting me because it was unprofessional. I called the 800 number and got someone amazing who listened and tried for me. That’s all I was asking for. The other two times I’ve dealt with hertz they didn’t have cars available when I came to pick up my reservation. Let’s just say this solidified that I will only ever be using Enterprise no matter what! I’d rather adjust my flights than deal with them ever again. But shout out to Cheryl at the 800 line! She listened and didn’t interrupt and responded respectfully!!!<//Review>

<Review>I was mostly disappointed in the fact my husband got a rental car with expired tags on it. We're lucky no ticket was issued but all that was said was "oh really" sorry about that with out really caring. It's not that hard to fake good customer service and be more compassionate toward your customers< /Review>< pics>

We wanted to change our car because of a technical problem (electrical charge failure). We had paid a full size car AND ALL THEY OFFERED US WAS A TOYOTA YARIS - for an upcoming trip of 2.500 miles and room for barely ONE suitcase!

All full size cars (the lot was flooded) were said to be “reserved” - an upgrade like an Impala or Buick La Crosse was “not available”. A customer who came after us ‘cause he had a flat tire was asked if he wanted the La Crosse - makes you feel REALLY cheated...

The next day we tried it again: This time another lady at the counter was real nice (the day before the two other clerks didn’t care...) and gave us a full size Chevy Malibu - one of the “reserved” cars from the day before!

Well, the guys working at the Hertz parking lot were very nice, especially Billy, who made us feel really welcome!

After just 200 miles the Malibu showed an oil change message - oil life capacity was 1%. To find it out, you have to push ONE knob at the steering wheel three times. Too much work for the mechanics who let that car go to a customer?!

At Hertz at Las Vegas airport we finally got the treatment we expected: ALL were VERY friendly and helpful and we got another car as fast as possible - even fulfilling our model wish (Ford Fusion Hybrid). Thanks a LOT to those guys!<//Text>

Over three weeks after our car was returned, our credit card was charged $75. Hertz claimed it was a cleaning fee due to "cigarette smoke and ashes all over the car"... except that we DON'T smoke EVER and were on a family trip with our young children.  The corporate office contacted the manager, who refused to reverse the charge.

Our bank representative said they have seen this before with them, which leads us to believe they are scamming people left and right just to make some extra money. We are now having to dispute through our credit card company (which according to the manager is the only way we might get our money back).

Unbelievable! We are Hertz Gold members and will NEVER rent from them again.<//Review>< pics>

< Review>
every location is different and the service really depends on the manager & staff.  I can't generalize the whole company off of one location, but I felt very taken care of by this location when I came in unexpectedly a short time before closing.  The manager was on his way out, stopped, and personally helped me.  As long as this is the culture being set at the location, it is a good name for the company as a while.<//Review>

Would never rent from this place again (or return here). The office is not open the same hours as the airport and they are less than helpful.  After calling Hertz to complain they informed me it was privately owned so they were not able to help me and sent me back to the local office.< /review>

I got my car in Palo Alto and I am driving down to Los Angeles. I noticed the tire is loosing air, I stoped at this Herzt office and they couldn't help me. No cars to exchange, nobody can fix it, the advise was go back to Palo Alto (2 hours away north, a 4 hour delay on my trip) or fix the car myself! I am renting this car and I need to fix it?
I had the worse experience renting a car, never again with this company!</text>

< review>
Unfortunately the rate was much higher than expected due to all of the add- ons.  This was a government rental so I doubt if they will endorse my renting from Hertz in Monterrey again even though the service was great
Great service at a high cost does not fly with the DOD<//review>

I agree, I got stuck with a 150 drop off charge by the manager at Hertz Monterey. I am a frequent customer and Gold member and I was outraged. It too me a bunch of calls to Hertz to get that charge reversed.<//review>

<username>Max E< /username><text>(Translated by Google) AVOID!
it was not easy to get a basic because they did not know which one was availlable (Yet I had a reservation!).
2 days later, I'll be back in the morning, clean and no damage, but one hour late. They make me one full day more.

---------------------------------
TO AVOID
They do not seem to know their car park available as it took 1 / 2h to book a car (and I had a reservation!).
2 days later, I return the car with the tank full, clean and without any damage, but one hour late. They paid me a full rental day and more.

(Original)
AVOID!
it took half an hour to rent a basic car because they didn't know which one was availlable (Yet I had a reseervation!).
2 days later, I gave back the car with full gas, clean and no damage, but one hour late. They charged me one full day more.

---------------------------------
À ÉVITER
Ils ne semblent pas connaître leur parc de voiture disponible car il a fallu 1/2h pour réserver une voiture (et j'avais une réservation !).
2 jours plus tard, je leur rend la voiture avec le réservoir plein, propre et sans aucun dommage, mais une heure en retard. Ils m'ont fait payé un jour de location entier en plus.</text><gmap_id>0x808de50f126c1bdd:0x648301e5df063f7b<//gmap_id>< Rate>

<Text>Lakita and Alexis (hope I spelt both names right 😞) were very helpful to my mother and I.

It started the day before when Lakita was very patient with me to find a bed in store for my mother. She is recovering from passed health issues and is going through physical therapy. Lakita was gracious enough to even measure how high the bed was from the ground for me.

I’m bringing my mother of a nursing home today and they were so kind as to take our unique circumstance and allow us to sign documents at home (their idea, not mine). 🥰 Alexis even mentioned that they were taking into consideration the safety of my elderly mother’s health regarding the covid outbreak.

I thanked her and asked her to pass on my gratitude to Lakita as well.

It’s so rare to find people in customer service that actually care!

Thank you Aaron’s for your outstanding customer service and especially thank you to Lakita and Alexis who went above and beyond expectations!!!

Ps. Sorry if I spelt your beautiful names wrong.<//Text>< Name>

< Review>
I've been a customer since 2014 and I have paid off every item that I've leased with them! I originally was leasing via the Manteca store until they closed down and moved my account to the March Lane Store in Stockton! Since the March Lane Store took over my account it has been hell. They have constantly harassed me over the phone. Called all of my references even told two of my references that my account is past due when it never has been. I've always paid online not in store. So every time they have called telling me my account is past due it was bs because I always pay early. Then the store Manager Chris tried discouraging me from paying my account online, and to come in and directly pay in store and with cash only. These people are frauds at the Match lane store. They tried getting me to pay extra when my account was NEVER past due. The last phone call of them telling me my account was past due was fals because I paid off my lease recently and Chris lied saying that it's still late. The next time they call I'm showing up with the police.<//Review>

About 4 years ago I was truly under financial pressure and needed a laptop computer replaced in one day. The Stockton, Ca store worked quickly and diligently to get the laptop to me including delivering it to me at my seasonal place of employment. The staff is friendly and very kind. They have become friends. I have has several contracts of purchase with them and am in the process of completely furnishing my home. I have purchased the laptop, washer dryer, refrigerator and bedroom set so far. I always look to them for my home needs. They worked with me during a time of real need and saved my home based business and I am committed to them forever because of it. I cannot say enough wonderful things about my experiences there. I can say that not all individuals are as nice and informed but with anywhere there is always one!! 99% of the times I have had to talk to anyone it has been fantastic. My next purchase will be a TV or Bedroom set or both!!! LOL< /Text>

I'm having trouble with a mattress I purchased 3 years ago. They don't seem to know the warranty carrier. Left messages with no call back. So update..over 2 months of waiting. Can't email "Phil" back so everything goes through store manager. They're going to replace mattress in couple of weeks. Mmm...probably gonna be the same issue in another few years. Will not do business with them in future.**another update so another month of waiting for my mattress. Called again today on 4/5/2019. Wow!!< /review>

You never know if they are open. Whenever I go there the lights are off and no one seems to be there. The one time I was able to go inside, we were not greeted and employees were nowhere to be found.< /Text>

Please please PLEASE ! Do not I repeat do not rent to own or purchase anything at all EVER from Aaron's. My recent experience was a horrendous one. I purchased 2 paired couches that I can no longer pay for monthly but they will not take them back because it's be used and isn't sellable ????? Basically they don't clean used furniture if it's returned it's immediately put back on the floor makes me wonder if my couches were even new to begin with disgusting and the guys who came to pick it up were extremely rude<//Text>

Absolutely HORRIBLE customer service! They find ways to over charge and make unauthorized charges on your account and they will find an excuse for EVERYTHING. They also become rude when you call them out on it. NEVER EVER do business with them. Lesson learned<//text>

I know that this company wants their property back quite evidently for non payment because they keep coming to my door once a week every week looking for the people who used to live at this apartment. I am not who you are looking for ! I just moved in here May 27th ! You have been at my door 3 different times ! I even showed you my lease agreement ! Stop disturbing me ! I do not know the person you are looking for ! I even called the store and the girl said we don't have an account with someone at that address ! REALLY then why do you send people to my door every week looking for the same person ????  STOP...one more time and it's called harassment ...I have proven 3 different times I am not who you are looking for ...stop disturbing me !!!!<//text>

I bought my car here I absolutely love my A6 quattro 3.0....  Service department is very fair and always on time with repairs or oil changes. They really make you feel valued here and not just somebody's buying a car. To seal staff is knowledgeable and they're not overly pushy. I would not go anywhere else to buy an Audi. The prices are very competitive and I can't say enough good things about the service department<//text>

<Text>Alex was the Service Advisor that helped me out and he not only provided excellent customer service, but answered all of my questions and went above and beyond to make sure I had a good experience. I came in thinking I needed work done, and they could have easily agreed with me, but instead, shared knowledge with me that saved me thousands. This professionalism has built trust with me and will definitely keep me coming back to get my service work done at Audi Newport Beach.</Text>< rate>

Highly recommend Audi Newport Beach and specifically Audi representative Christopher Scales.  He definitely worked his magic and exuded knowledge, professionalism and patience at all times. I was working on a tight timeline to purchase a car and appreciated the great customer care and flexibility.  I communicated with multiple car dealerships including other local Audi dealers and Newport Audi rose above the rest.  I was happy and most comfortable to purchase through Newport.  The experience from intro/sales to signing on the dotted line was straightforward, quick and easy. Best car buying experience!< /Text>

<review>No stars is not an option so I had to give them at least one star. I first want to say that the salesman we dealt with initially was outstanding in every way. We went through the TrueCar auto buyer service offered by Schools First. We called the dealership in advance and made an appointment. We also intended to trade in two vehicles so my husband and I drove in separately. While we were about to leave for our test drive another buyer came in. While we were on our test drive the Sales Manager, Scott Conner sold the vehicle. He was fully aware that we were there to make a purchase and that we had an appointment (otherwise we would not have driven our trade-ins all the way to Newport). If this is standard practice in the industry so be it, but I think buyers should be well aware that this how how Audi Newport Beach operates. You have so many options when you purchase a car these days, I can't for the life of me understand why you would go to a dealership with this low level of integrity and poor standards of customer service. Ultimately we are glad we did not make a purchase through a dealership that operates this way, but my heart goes out to the salesman that was in the process of completing our transaction. It should have been his sale. I will of course be contacting Schools First to let them know how we were treated as they pride themselves on providing excellent customer service to their members. I will also post about our experience on all available social media outlets.</review><rating>1< /rating>< GmapID>

<review>I was due for my 25,000 mile service and brought it in to the Audi Newport Beach location. Everything was easy and painless. I was able to make an appointment right away and was even given a loaner vehicle to use while my car was being serviced. Alexander was the team member that took care of my service and did a great job! He walked me through the service and gave me a call as soon as it was finished. I am happy with the service that was provided and my car feels great!<//review>< Pics>

I took my 5 month old Audi to the Newport location and it was seamless process. Alexander assisted me from start to finish, taking care of all the logistics - while keeping me informed of every step of the way. I was set up with a loaner car and called when my car was ready for pickup. Extremely fast process.  Once my car was ready for pickup, Alexander greeted me outside and escorted over to my fixed and cleaned car.  He assisted me in transferring personal belongings from the loaner car to my mine, a cold water bottle waiting for me and a pretty rad Audi cup for my enjoyment - very nice touch. 5 Stars ALL the way!</text>

Chris and Mike were terrific.  They made the buying experience very quick and easy.  They are both extremely helpful and personable guys.  This is the second Q7 we've had and it is a fantastic car.

Every personal interaction at the dealership was pleasant, courteous and professional.  I definitely recommend getting your next car from Audi of Newport Beach!<//Review>

Cedric E. was a great salesman.  He understood what I wanted and did not badger me until he had just the right car. He was never pushy.  His sales manager, Alex, was also fair and efficient. However, make sure you get anything they promise you in writing...<//Review>

I have always loved Audi but have never loved the process of shopping for a car.  I was pleasantly surprised with the amazing customer service and detailed attention I received from my sales guy and his general sales manager. They were honest with me and upfront through the whole process and gave me complete confidence I was in good hands. I had a great experience and would recommend anyone to Audi of Newport. A special thanks to Scott and Alex for really going the extra mile and making sure I purchased the perfect car for my needs and wants! #Ateam< /review>

This was my first time getting service done and had a positive experience. I needed a tire replaced and was in and out within a couple hours. Genesis was my service advisor, and was very friendly and professional. I also love how all Audi dealers have complimentary snacks, water, and an assorted coffee machine available for their customers. I now live in Costa Mesa, so this location is closest to me and am happy to return for future maintenance and repairs.</review>

Had a great experience with Sasha.  Really took care of us and followed up with us even after selling us the car.  Highly recommend this dealer.  Also liked that he kept his word and gave us the deal we had agreed upon on the phone.  Didn't have the bait and switch like other dealers that just try to get you in the door and then tell you that they can't honor the deal for this reason or that.<//Text>

<Review>My experience at Newport Beach Audi was amazing I originally started out at San Diego Audi they were not working on the price of the vehicle or the down payment. They just wanted me to hurry and sign the paperwork. I left and contacted Newport Audi spoke to Alex he assured me they could do better I went up there and he did what he said he was gonna do he got me a car with all the options for a way better price a fraction of the down and my payment is actually less. I bought a 2016 A7 and I'm extremely happy he went above and beyond what he needed to do to earn my business. I would recommend him to anyone looking for a Audi. You won't be dissatisfied.</Review></record>

This was the best Audi Service experience I've ever had. Miguel was my service advisor, he's exceptionally well mannered and communicative. I knew everything that was being done with my car every step of the way. Working with Miguel I knew that there would not be any unnecessary work done on my car. I look forward to working with the service department in the future. If the service department is an exemplar of all the departments at this Audi location, I will eventually come back to buy from here.</Review>

Went in got the car for my nephew, with the help from Chris Hung. All I can honestly say,  this was the best stress free buying a car. Not only Chris but Alex the Manager and Ms Kim in finance also. I love simple straight and fair deals and not much time wasted. Awesome guys!</review>

I enjoy taking my car into Audi Newport. I deal with Devin Rhodes and he always informs me in details everything related to my car and asks me if I need any assistance with a loaner or a ride somewhere. I know that is his job, but he just has a great way of dealing with people naturally and it's refreshing as most dealerships are not that attentive. Audi Newport you are lucky to have Devin!< /text>

<text>Best car buying experience ever, Travis made everything effortless, no haggling.  Alex was also great, provided us with our first ever Wedge burger and went over all the car amenities in detail. This was my second time leasing from Newport Audi and will definitely be back again

Thank you,

Alexander Hamlin is the go to guy for exceptional and professional customer service.  The man knows his stuff, as soon as he sat in my car and turned it on, he diagnosed it himself and sure enough that's what it was.  When I ran into the issues I had with my vehicle, he helped me the entire way through and made the entire process was as painless as possible.  From helping with getting my vehicle to the dealership, and handing over my key back to me at the end, Alexander was patient and extremely determined that my vehicle was given back to me better than when i dropped it off.  Overall, I have nothing but positive things to say about my experience with the service I received from Alexander and the Newport Audi staff.  It makes me feel better knowing that I have them to go to for help.< /review>

<Review>Cedric Evans, the car salesman that helped me get into my new 2011 Audi A5, was very helpful and friendly during the whole car buying process. What I liked most was how he did not try to force the sale instead he heard what I had to say and helped me finalize my decision on the car.</Review>< resp>

The review is not for Alex Hamlin the service representative but Audi quality of technicians and overal service quality.
1) Took 1 week for 125 car service . At the end had my audio system not working and shows device fault.
2) For the cost and quality would not recommend this place.

Alex was great.</Review>

<review>I brought my car here with the best intentions - to have a strange noise investigated. Upon arrival, and despite four employees listening to it and agreeing that something didn't sound right, they were unable to replicate it the next day. When I picked the car up, it was shoehorned so tightly among the other cars, it took 20 minutes to retrieve it. After ten minutes in traffic the noise returned, which tells me the dealership didn't even look for the problem. I won't be back, and I recommend anyone who drives an RS car to look elsewhere for service.<//review><Response>None< /Response>< time>

I would recommend Audi of Newport Beach to anyone looking to buy an Audi. I communicated with Alex through E-Mail about an Audi A3 they had in stock. After a few days of E-Mailing back and fourth, I decided to go by the dealership to check it out. On my way to the dealership, Alex E-Mailed me to let me know that particular car was sold, but since I was so close to the store I decided to just go in. We went over all the options, and I was so impressed with his professionalism that I decided to change the package I wanted and buy that day. This place you will not have to deal with the typical car buying experience. Ask for Alex. You will be impressed.< /text>

Went go Audi Newport last week to look around for a car..had no intentions of getting anything. After a few hours I walked out with a new A4 happy as a clam. Worked with several sales members there and some other staff as well, they were all polite and straight forward. They ended up getting me a pretty awesome deal and would highly recommend this dealer!</Text>

<text>I was due for my 35k mile check up and I wanted to find an Audi Dealership that would assist me, I did not purchase my car at a Audi (which will never be the case again after my great experience). Anyways, Alexander was my direct contact and walked me through the whole process. I was a little nervous going without my husband but Alex put me at ease and was very polite. He even offered a courtesy car and a carwash. They have a bundle offer where they do both 35k & 45k check up, I called 3 separate Audi's and NP was the most reasonably priced. I will most definitely be back for any future maintenance.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I drove up from San Diego to buy a used Audi from this dealership, and I had a great experience. Jalal was a very friendly salesman, a real car enthusiast, and very knowledgeable about the car I was buying. The purchase was about as painless as one could expect a car purchase to be; they took care of all the paperwork in maybe a little over an hour or so while they detailed my car, had me sign on some dotted lines, and I took my car (an immaculately clean S5 that I *love*) home immediately.< /Text>

I had a great experience at Newport Beach Audi.  Jose took great care of me & made sure I understood the service I was receiving.  It was a quick trip and I left with a cold bottle of complimentary water & sparkling clean car.  Will definitely be coming back for any future service needs.< /Text>

Chris, Scott and the entire sales team went above and beyond to create a very positive buying experience.  We purchased a pre-owned vehicle that was priced very competitively and the purchase process was easy and quick.   We had a couple of minor cosmetic issues with the vehicle and the sales / services team quickly addressed them.  This is the first time I've dealt with Audi Newport and am very impressed.</Review>

So much better than when I first test drove Audi's in Santa Monica.  It is worth the drive to buy from Newport.  Robert Breisch was so helpful in finding me the model and color I wanted.  He delivered it the same day!  Their whole team from Sales to Finance know their stuff and walked me through all of the details.    I would buy from them again, and am happy they are there for whatever I need while owning my Audi.   P.S-  It's a dream.  Test drive one!<//Review></record>

Newport Audi continues to make my experience owning an Audi an easy and enjoyable one.  Took my new S5 in for the first 5K service and the process was quick and easy.  I was even provided with a pretty cool Audi Sport coffee mug as a token of their appreciation for my business.  This is my 2nd Audi and I can honestly say that working with their service rep Devin has been a pleasure.  Thanks Newport Audi!</review>

Thank you Ryan in the Audi service department.  Everything was professional and done in a respectfully timely manner.  Answered every question I had.  Once I arrived I was greeted with a "Good Morning" brought in to the service office.  Ryan had my car loaner ready and I was out within 10mins tops.  My car was finished that day but I was unable to get my car because of work.  I had asked Ryan if it would be an issue to keep the loaner car until the next morning, he said, "No problem, see you in the morning."  Once I arrived the next morning, everything was ready to go once again, I was in and out.  Thank you Ryan for the Great service!  Best regards, Audi owner, Michell Bell</text>

<review>I will say they have a great location and good inventory, but our experience with the sales person was an absolute waste of time.  We specifically asked for quotes over the phone before driving to their dealership but the sales person refused.  We made an appointment and when we arrive they told us they could not meet our payment request.  This was after waiting in the lobby for 30 minutes from the time of our appointment.  This was completely unprofessional so we left.  The sales person did nothing to keep our business which included the purchase of a 2015 Q7 and A7!  You would think they would have done something to save the business...

We ended up going to Commonwealth Audi.  We requested the same cars and monthly payment which was $200 per month less than Audi Newport Beach.  We are now proud owners of a 2015 Q7 and 2015 A7.  These are the 2nd and 3rd Audi purchases.  We are fans of Audi, but disappointed in the Newport Beach dealership.  With that, you bet I'm posting a positive review for Commonwealth Audi!  If Newport Beach refuses to provide quotes then don't waste your time visiting the dealership.</review>< rate>

My experience working with Josh Sweeney was seamless. I already knew that I wanted to purchase my car at lease end and he me Glenn in Finance worked great together.  I was able to go through my credit union for the financing but sign all the paperwork in that same visit without a separate trip to the credit union. Very easy.< /review>

<Text>I had a great experience at Newport Audi.  They were helpful and professional every step of the way. They painstakingly answered all of my questions and concerns. They were mindful of my time and tried to expedite wherever possible. Mike Quesada treated me as if I were the only customer in the store and continues to make himself available moving forward. Most of all I love my new car!</Text><GmapID>0x80dce0751c4abbf3:0x4bea372744a05e5a</GmapID></record></dataset><record>
<review>We were just looking at Q3 sedans. Our customer service representative "Michael Quezada, without pressure and being very knowledgeable helped us make a decision to purchase an Q3 sedan. He is a local guy whose very down to earth, and genuinely interested in us as people not just potential buyers. I would recommend that if you in the market for a new or used Audi stop by an see our friend. You won't regret it and you'll have a nice sales experience as well.<//review>< Name>

Pleasant from the beginning through the end.  The sales person, Mike, was very accommodating, was patient, and made my wife & I feel comfortable.  After the final paperwork was signed and completed, he swung back around and took the time to assist with configuring some of the settings.</text>

<text>This is my first Audi - but the second in our family. I drove another luxury brand for 14 years and was amazed to experience all that I have been missing. My SQ5 is not only beautiful but it was a pleasant process to purchase. I am a very happy Audi owner and will always recommend Audi Newport Beach.<//text>< GmapID>

Just leased an A7 from Chris Scales at the Newport Beach Audi. My experience was fast, easy, and they were willing to negotiate within my price range. Even the financial department was comprehensive, yet to the point.The dealership is well maintained, and the staff is all very kind and friendly. Love the car and looking forward to going back and purchasing another once the lease is up. Highly recommend this dealership.< /Text>

In all likelihood have leased my last car from them.  A simple issue of leasing a car in July and them not installing the roof rack.  Turns out they did not include the key, and about four weeks of phone tag with the leasing company and Audi Corporate, no one can resolve this.  They can send someone over for a loyal customer, but they do not seem to care.< /Review>< pics>

If anyone in the process of buying a car, I highly recommended Audi Newport Beach. I also recommended asking for Joshua and GM Alex. They are very very very professional. This is the best buying experience we ever had especially we had purchased Range Rovers, BMW, Mercedes Benz before. By the way we love our new Q7. Thank you< /review>

<text>Jose is unprofessional and said "omg" on the phone? A Audi rep with a fake attitude. Great. He doesn't try to find a solution. And refuses to help my car and admits it's a defective car. Everyone knows that Audi is responsible and has to take ownership. They have a real big budget on things like this every month and still refuse to help even when i would be happy to pay some. Everyone here at Newport Audi, knows that Audi 09-11 B8 has a bad oil consumption problem. I am within the warranty 80,000 zone and I know there is a way to help me through that I have a case. Jose had no nerve to step up and admitted how Audi was defective. I hope to speak with high management to find a way to make this right and fix this defective Audi I have already put $3,500 into , In the last year.<//text>< Pics>

<user_name>Bill Hardesty<//user_name><date>1521829017915</date><rate>1< /rate><Review>We purchased an Audi A5 from Audi Newport Beach on 4/1/15.  The sales person sold us on prepaying for our first brake job, a new battery, windshield wipers, front end alignment, and new key batteries which cost us about $650.  The sales person told us that we needed to make sure that we had those items replaced prior to 4/1/18.  The sales person told us that even if the items do not need replacement at that time we need to insist and they will replace them.  We took our car into the shop this week to have these items replaced along with two recalls.  The service department refused to replace the brakes and the battery.  I spoke to a lady who was in charge of the service department and she was down right rude and verbally attacked me for simply asking for what we were promised.  She had the general manager, Gordon, call me.  Gordon was even more rude.  He basically told me that this is the stupidest thing he has heard in the 34 years he has been in the business.  Again, they are attacking me for simply asking for what they promised to me at the time of the sale.  I understand that my brakes are not used up and my battery is not dead yet, but this does not relieve them of providing what was promised to us.  I believe I am still waiting for a call back from Gordon to see what they will do.  In any case I will avoid this dealership at all cost and any other Autonation dealership.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

My husband and I just purchased a pre-owned Audi S5 Cabriolet from Audi Newport Beach.

Have to say that our salesperson really added to the positive experience.  Thank you Drew Clinton for being so friendly and attentive and for laughing at my husband's bad jokes.

Erik and I were commenting that we had never had such an enjoyable car buying experience.

The dealership's interior facilities are nicely appointed with a coffee station and relaxing waiting area with TV.  All of the staff there at the dealership where a delight to work with (our Finance Manager was especially fun too).

Well done to the folks at Audi Newport Beach (such a great camaraderie there with all the staff).</Review>

This was my first service at Audi Newport since I purchased my car 6 months prior. To say I was given extraordinary service is an understatement.  My tech, Miguel, greeted me immediately.  I had asked for a shuttle ride to work but when Miguel called for it I overheard it wasn't available.  However he made another quick phone call and another staff member, Susanna arrived with a smile on her face to and a loaner car within a minute.  It was a very pleasant surprise as I expected I'd have to wait and possibly be late for work.  When I went to pick up the car (ready ahead of promised time) I honestly was shocked that it was sitting by the door ready for me to get in and go.  I'd previously owned a Mercedes, and always dreaded taking it for service to Fletcher Jones because even if I arrived an hour after the car was allegedly ready, I ALWAYS sat and waited for someone to bring it up for 45 minutes.
So I am smitten with Audi Newport, my entire experience so far from purchase your service has been above and beyond excellent.  Bravo.< /text>

Alex was very accommodating with my 25,000 mile service!!

1.  Offered me shuttle service back to my home
2.  Got authorization to get the tires rotated
3.  Gave me additional information on other Audi vehicles I was looking to purchase
4.  Kept me informed of the progress of the service and pick up shuttle service

Thanks again Alex for the exceptional service!!<//Text>

Had some issues with my audi a4. Brought In for repairs and Devin with the service department was able to assist me. I was provided another vehicle while my mine was under repair. I kept getting updates from Devin on the vehicle almost daily and within a week my car was ready to go. Thanks for the help and great service.< /Text>

What has also been truly exceptional is the personal treatment i have received from Newport Audi- from Roman- sales agent to the entire staff i came in contact with during the  transaction. All helpful, all professional and willing to answer my long winded questions and spend the time with me to understand all of the features-and how to use the tech. package to its fullest- the issue is the car is smarter than me, but that is another story.
Since I live part time in Pasadena, and part time in Corona del Mar there were several options of where to purchase my new car. The car sells itself. However Roman was so fantastic in his helpfulness and humor.  He never was pushy, but made sure I purchased what I wanted and was happy with the car. I have already gone to Newport Audi for my first of many of complimentary hand car washes.  what a treat.< /review>< Pics>

I used to go to this Audi Auto Nation location for my Q5's service.  I had mostly good experience.  However, yesterday (10/24/17) when I stopped by to get more information on leasing a new Q5 after my existing lease is over, I was treated rudely by Diego.  He was disrespectful.

I asked about current lease specials and was told there is but was shown none.  When I asked to test drive the new Q5 since it had been re-designed recently.  He didn't event wait for me to gather my stuff to go outside, I had to look for him.  When I finally found him, who was standing by a Q5 with all the doors open, he said "Look the monthly lease payment is going to be over $600. If this is something over your budget, let's not waste each other's time."  I was speechless.  How rude!

My experience was put right by the sales manager Alex.  I hope he also took note on training their sales associates.

There are a number of Audi dealers in the OC.  I took my business elsewhere.< /Text>

Audi Newport Beach's management & sales staff are EXCEPTIONAL & very professional! I had always purchased a BMW for over 20yrs so this is my first Audi but I can tell you it won't be my last! Gordon Glacomazzi the General Manager was very helpful, courteous & honest, not your usual car dealer treatment! My salesman, Sasha was equally as profecient & took the time to explain this marvelous vehicle & spent time with me test driving three cars so there would be no unanswered questions! I am so enthused with this vehicle & all of its many features & benefits! KUDOS to Gordon, Sasha, Kim & Audi for the best auto buying I have ever experienced!<//Text>

<review>This is by the far the best car buying experience I've ever had. I've been shopping around for almost a month and had been to many dealerships. None of them were able to make me feel 100% comfortable until I walked into Audi Newport Beach. Earl assisted me the entire time and gave me great options. I walked into this dealership planning to purchase a CPO but walked out buying a new A4 with a better deal. Earl was very friendly and causal unlike your typical pushy car salesmen. He personally delivered my new car to my house the next day! I would highly recommend this place to anyone!!!<//review><name>Doris Mitsuya< /name>< Pictures>

I had to pay my registration fee again this year and learned that I'd had four recalls on my Q5 that I wasn't aware of.  I couldn't pay my registration until they were fixed so I called Audi and they rushed me in and took care of all the recalls on my car and my husbands Audi .  They were very nice and efficient.  Thank you Audi.< /review>

Great car buying experience.   Low pressure - high service - market pricing (even in a high rent district like Newport Beach).   I'll be back!

Diesel A6 is an incredible machine - beast like performance and miser gas mileage

(38 MPG highway and 5.6 0- 60.... What??? leave it to the Germans...)

We bought a car for our daughters 16th birthday! Buying from Audi Newport Beach was one of the best and easiest experiences we have ever had buying a car! Their customer service is outstanding! Would definitely recommend this location!< /Review>

Alex and Sasha from Audi Newport Beach exceeded my expectations when I started shopping for a new car to lease. One of my conditions was that I wanted to finalize a deal via email and Alex was more than willing to do that for me. He was easy to work with and we came to an agreed price within 2 days. Never once did I feel pressured, disrespected which is really important to me considering the number of arrogant dealers I've had to deal with in the last few months. Both Alex and Sasha were both professional from start to finish. 5 stars for sure!</review>

After horrible experiences trying to get in contact with the service department at Audi Mission Viejo, I just switched my service to Audi Newport Beach. While the dealership itself has a smaller footprint making maneuverability outside a little more difficult, there are people there to direct you with minimal inconvenience, if any. Every member that I dealt with in the service department was courteous and promptly responsive to my emails, calls and dealings within the dealership itself. I expect a certain level of customer service from a luxury auto dealership and Audi Newport Beach more than met my expectations.</review>

My experience in negotiating a mutually agreed upon price was fair, direct, and exhibit complete trust.  The car was ready the next day and some minor post sale items were addressed in a professional and expedient manner.

This is my first Audi purchase and my experience will most likely lead to future transactions with Mike and the Newport Beach team.<//Review>< Pics>

Our service manager, Jose, is, and always has been excellent.  He makes sure that we get prompt, courteous & efficient service.  While the Audi facility itself is somewhat difficult to get in and out of, and the parking is cramped, it is definitely worth it to go there, and I would highly recommend it.</review>

<text>Let me start from what I’ve leased many cars for the past 6 years and deal with a lots of different dealerships and sales people. I can tell Audi of Newport Beach was by far one of the most pleasant places to lease the car. I leased 2015 A4 from them and my Audi Representative was Alex Beitz. He provided unforgettable buying experience from start to finish, best price, no "dealer games", honesty, great communication, not mentioned he picked me up from the airport and brought me to the dealership to complete paperwork and pick up the car. The whole process took me about an hour, Fast and Easy in professional manner and not pushy at all, I think that's we all expect from the dealers. Definitely will work with Audi of Newport Beach again for my next Audi. And yes, I recommend them and Alex! Thank you Alex for my A4 and great deal.</text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80dce0751c4abbf3:0x4bea372744a05e5a<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Poor customer service, or should I️ say no customer service. Went in to this dealership to have someone help me pair a phone to my New Q7.  Nice looking dealership with 10 employees with no customers.  Alex informed me that we would have to make an appointment Monday thru Friday to get such help.  Your sending a message to your customer Alex.  Not a very good one.</text>

We arrived there on a Wednesday rainy night because that was the only time we were  able to drive up there.  We finalized all our paperwork by 10:00 and they close at 9:00 but the people we dealt did not rush us to complete the paperwork and took their time with us to help answer any questions we had with regard to the paperwork or car itself.  They were all very friendly, would highly recommend them.  The only reaason I gave 4 stars is that one of the keys did not work so we have to bring it to an Audi dealer to figure out what is wrong with it.  I would have gave 4.5stars but don't know how to do that.  Facility is nice and well kept.< /Review>

Audi Newport Beach

Best Audi dealership in Southern California. Best overall luxury car dealer in my opinion.
This was our first time shopping for a luxury car, and we went to South Coast Audi, Westminster Lexus, Crevier BMW, Fletcher Jones Motorcars, none treated us better than Audi Newport Beach.
Which was surprising because it's right next to Porsche and Bently you would think they would be elitist, but it was the opposite. Especially compared to South Coast Audi where they thought our budget limit was laughable and were not helpful at all in making a deal happen. The sales person literally questioned me where i got my price number, "this is a $40k car where did you get such a low number" he asked. First of all I don't have to answer to him, and secondly that was around where our budget left us. Needless to say we didn't go back there.
The experience at Audi Newport Beach was great and Sasha especially was kind, caring, understanding, helpful, and took the time to show us the A4 we were interested in and listen to our needs even though they were super busy on New Years Monday. No pressure was put on us what-so-ever. This was a whole new experience for us.
We told him our budget limit which we thought the dealer wouldn't be able to get close too because of how the other dealerships had treated us, but they really worked with us, surprisingly. We are grateful, otherwise we could not make this happen. A few hours later we drove home in our new Audi A4 extremely happy.<//Review>

<text>Great, knowledgeable and friendly staff at Audi Newport Beach made buying a new car quite a wonderful experience. I love my new A3! Sasha was my salesman and he made the whole process from start to finish very smooth and surprisingly relaxing. He wasn't pushy or rude as a lot of sales folks can be as you peruse the car lot and think over your options from what vehicle you want to the financing to the final sale. I was very pleased with the interest rate to finance through Audi, it was actually better than the rate USAA was able to offer me. The price of the car was exactly what I was wanting and it was nice to not have to haggle with them. They clearly know they want to do business and made the price right without making the customer feel like they're on Price is Right. Transaction was quick and seamless.< /text><Name>Amanda Feld</Name><GmapID>0x80dce0751c4abbf3:0x4bea372744a05e5a< /GmapID><resp>None<//resp>< Pics>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>I cannot say enough about Audi Newport Beach. This dealership is what every business should strive to be.  Everyone there is top notch.  We were in the market for a CPO 2015 A4 with a specific color.  Found one at another Audi dealership in the SF Bay Area since we live in Nor Cal.  Had an appointment and while we were driving the hour to the delearship they sold the car.  Salesman did not even stick around to tell us the car was sold (we were told he had other things to do and left). Wife was crushed and near tears when we got there and someone else driving away in "her car."  Fast forward two days.  Google search directed us to Newport Beach who had just received a lease return. Same year, model and color we wanted.  Contacted Jalal who made the process so easy that he worked with us to mark the car as "sold" on Tuesday even though we were not able to get down until Sunday.  Booked our flight and got my wife "her car" from Audi Newport Beach.  We had a great experience here. This is our first Audi and we will never drive anything else. We will spend the extra $$ for a plane ticket or gas to buy our next Audi from Newport Beach.  If you are in the market, check this place out. My money would be on you buying from them!!!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80dce0751c4abbf3:0x4bea372744a05e5a< /gmapID></record>

Went to look at an audi A3 and A4. In had an appointment with a salesman and he was busy when we got there so the had someone else wait in us. They did not have the cars ready for us to look at and when they did bring them to us (20 minutes later) to look at they were not even washed or cleaned. I thought spending 40 to 50k on a car would be a better experience.

Try going to a different Audi dealer in my opinion.<//Text>

Just leased the new A3 e-tron from Audi Newport Beach.  Great car, but the service was even better!  Many thanks to Evan and Sasha, who took great care of us and insured that we received the best deal in the marketplace!</review>

The best car buying experience I've ever had. Mike and Alex were exceptional and made us feel comfortable during the entire process.   There was not a lot of going back and forth, I offered my price and Alex agreed.  After checking with other dealerships I am confident that we received the best price from Auto Nation and Audi of Newport Beach.  I highly recommend this dealership and especially Mike Quezada and Alex Beitz.</text>

Best experience I've had going to a dealership shopping for my first car on my own. With the help of Chris, Alex, their manager Gordon, I was able to purchase my Acura TLX and trade in my Fiat 500L. They are welcoming and work hard to earn your business and are always available for any questions you may have and I look forward to coming back here in the future as a returning customer.<//Review>

Great deal, no BS. No games with financing or no slick salesmanship, just professional help and a speedy sales process.  They got us a deal with Audi financing that no other dealership said was available, so we were super happy.< /Review>

This was one of the best experiences anyone could have. At no point  did the team make me feel like I was being sold to or having to deal with the stereotypical car sales process!
Sales staff - Sasha, Patrick, Alex and even to the top ranks of leadership the GM Gordon make you feel like your life long friends just talking cars and other fun stuff.  This is what it takes to win a customer for life.
You guys should be proud of how your changing the way cars are being purchased! Hats off the the sales team a Audi Newport Beach. Anyone else out the looking to purchase a car see guys are well worth the drive and time spent. It's rare in to find guys who keep in touch during the entire process, under promise and over deliver !!

Thanks

I knew what I wanted to buy so just walked in and met Jalal, he was really helpful and explained everything very well. Had to wait for quite some time for the finance since the guy was working with someone else. Overall great experience. Negotiations worked well and I took the car home same day - that too the last one they had; the display model.

Jalal worked with us until the end; Explained all features during test drive and even while taking the car home. Overall good buying experience.<//Review>

Great service and friendly people. Made it very easy to take my car in for service and when it was going to be a long wait offered me a loaner car to get around until my car was done.</text>

< review>
The worst car buying experience I have ever had. I travelled from Canada to pick up a car I thought looked great online- after months of searching i found one at Audi Newport Beach, I talked to Shea who said the car was immaculate, and that it was ready to go as soon as I arrived. I purchase a plane ticket fly down and make the 2 hr drive to pick it up. When I get there the vehicle is not even washed, the detail is awful, cigarette holes and burns, stinks, stains on the interior and rips throughout the leather. I ask them to fix it and after they had me rush down to purchase it now cannot have it ready for me for another week. I wait the time go back to pick the car up and it's still filthy, the steering wheel so sticky it stretches the skin on my hand when I pull away. The general manager, Gordon was just as unhelpful, to the point of being rude. Beyond this, 2 months after purchasing the vehicle I am still unable to register it because the dealership mistakenly sent my title and paperwork to a DMV in the wrong state. Furthermore, I had 10 hard pulls of my credit before they found financing that was halfway adequate. I could see 3-5 but 10 is absurd. Beyond this, they have lied to me on multiple occasions, misrepresented the vehicle they advertised online, and downright lied about its condition and quality. They told me there was a spare key in this box right before I signed the papers for the car and when I looked in the box after there was no key. They removed the cargo cover from the car after I purchased it and have been constantly unhelpful. At this point they are screening my phone calls, Audi care USA has had to step in and still Audi Newport will not give their customers the mere respect of a phone call back, an email, or anything for that matter. This is not the dealership one should purchase a car from if they want to be treated with any sort of dignity. They are morons- all of them, not only will they lie to you about the quality of vehicle they sell to you they will ruin your credit and life outside of the car buying as well. Avoid this place at all costs, I know I will.< /review>

It was simple to make an appointment to see the car I found on the Internet.  The test drive was leisurely and thorough.  Negotiating the price was not stressful.  During the finance session, we were not pressured to purchase extended warranties or other add-ons.  Questions regarding my new car have been promptly answered on the phone.  All the staff we encountered at the dealership were friendly and helpful.

I recently worked with Miguel in Service to resolve an issue with my satellite radio.  The problem was disagnosed and fixed, and I am enjoying satellite radio again.</review>

I called Audi Newport Beach to discuss purchasing a pre-owned A8.  To my surprise they were able to get me into a brand new A8 in my budget range. They were efficient and really great to deal with.  I really enjoyed working with Brad Cormier and his colleagues at the dealership.  5 star experience.  Very pleased.< /Text>

Thank you Ruschka and Newport Audi for making the new car process very easy! Ruschka was kind enough to come in on her day off to accommodate my schedule and get me into a new A4. The process was seamless, as I was in and out in about 20 minutes. I would highly recommend Newport Audi to friends and family. I have leased my last two Audi's from them, and will certainly be back for my next one!<//Text>

<text>I was originally going to make this a one star because of the poor service and communication from the service dept. I've made calls and requests and have been told I'd receive return calls that never happened. Seemed to be an epidemic. Loaner program??? Perhaps or perhaps I wasn't important because I leased my vehicle out of state before moving to the area.

My last service experience I was dreading but my advisor got me in and out on time and was friendly so I upped my rating.

Highly unlikely I will use them again. Not due to price but customer service.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><rate>3<//rate><Name>Landon Brewer< /Name><gmap_id>0x80dce0751c4abbf3:0x4bea372744a05e5a<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We have owned 5 Audi's in the past 10 years.   We have tried all of the dealerships in the Orange County area for service and have found Audi of Newport Beach to be by far the best.  We drive from Yorba Linda just to make sure our cars are serviced well, and we don't have to bring them back for minor, annoying issues.

I highly recommend Newport Audi and, specifically, Devon Rhoades who has provided superior service at each visit!!

Thank you Newport Audi and Devon!</review>

<response>None< /response><Review>The dealership looks prestine.  Upon arrival there were plenty of parking.  I was immediately greeted by Josh then Alex.  Then I met Mike Quezada.  Mike was genuine and sincere from the start.  I was interested in a SQ5.  I looked online prior to my arrival and Newport Beach Audi had a better selection.  The process from selecting a car, test drive, paperwork, and financing were seamless.  They made an offer I couldn't refuse.  I felt no pressure whatsoever.  There was no back and forth between the customer and the sales manager.  Financing was a breeze.  They valued my time and business.  I love my new car.  I can't thank enough the team involved with the transaction.  From Josh, Alex, Mike, Jackson and the porters who stayed late to clean and put gas in my new car.  You guys rock!  Thanks for welcoming me to the Audi family.  You have a customer for life!</Review><gmap_id>0x80dce0751c4abbf3:0x4bea372744a05e5a<//gmap_id>< username>

Really happy with my purchase through Audi of Newport. I purchased a pre-owned 2015 A3 and I'm loving my car. Sasha Poleshuk was my sales representative and he is a straight shooter. Doesn't try to put you into something that you're not looking for. I would recommend friends and family to this dealership.</review>

Worst follow up and customer service I've ever experienced.   Even after purchasing the car they did not follow up with us to let us know when the car was ready for pick up.  We had to call them 3 times in one day to check up on when the car was available.</review>

Great experience with this dealership. Had an engine issue and called Devin. He got my car in immediately, got me a loaner despite the fact that my arrival wasnt scheduled or forecasted ... absolutely great service mindedness. Very communicative.<//Review>

<Resp>None</Resp><Review>we would have given them a 5 star except on the day of our appointment, they did not have a loaner car for us.our appointment was made more than a week ahead of time and a loaner car was requested. since we have to have a loaner, our appointment was pushed back to the next day. we have never in decades where this is a problem at any other dealers.  with that being said, our service advisor did the best he could to get us taken care of.  he was professional and we dont fault him for this. some one in management needs to figure out how best to avoid this in the future. at the end of the day, our car got serviced. we were inconvenienced and we can live with that.</Review><rating>4</rating>< UserId.>

I was hesitant to switch car dealers because i was so attached to the customer service I was getting from my other car, but Sasha proved that wrong! He is great. Nice, smart, polite, so easy to work with. He understood my pain points straight away (which were very particular) and sorted through the info to find me the perfect car! And he did. I LOVE my Q5. Best car i have ever had! Apple play is amazing! I spend alot of time in the car and i can still work and drively safely, never touching my phone! No tickets for me!
Sasha, thank you! See you soon to visit!</Text>< Pictures>

Did not think in the least that I was going to leave an Audi owner, but Ruschka Sanguinetti helped my fiance and I find the perfect Q5 to fit my budget.

<Text>I was originally going to make this a one star because of the poor service and communication from the service dept. I've made calls and requests and have been told I'd receive return calls that never happened. Seemed to be an epidemic. Loaner program??? Perhaps or perhaps I wasn't important because I leased my vehicle out of state before moving to the area.

My last service experience I was dreading but my advisor got me in and out on time and was friendly so I upped my rating.

Highly unlikely I will use them again. Not due to price but customer service.<//Text>< date>

< review>
The dealership looks prestine.  Upon arrival there were plenty of parking.  I was immediately greeted by Josh then Alex.  Then I met Mike Quezada.  Mike was genuine and sincere from the start.  I was interested in a SQ5.  I looked online prior to my arrival and Newport Beach Audi had a better selection.  The process from selecting a car, test drive, paperwork, and financing were seamless.  They made an offer I couldn't refuse.  I felt no pressure whatsoever.  There was no back and forth between the customer and the sales manager.  Financing was a breeze.  They valued my time and business.  I love my new car.  I can't thank enough the team involved with the transaction.  From Josh, Alex, Mike, Jackson and the porters who stayed late to clean and put gas in my new car.  You guys rock!  Thanks for welcoming me to the Audi family.  You have a customer for life!<//review>

<Text>Extremely professional, knowledgeable, insuring that my experience at Newport Audi in purchasing my Q7 Prestige was the right one. Gordon the General Manager, Jalal Kawa my sales manager, to Glenn Handzlik our finance manager made us feel that purchasing our Audi was comfortable, friendly, with not one once of pressure. I researched  and drove several other manufactures vehicles before making my decision and now know made the right choice.  The features, ride and quality of my Audi exceed my expectations. Hats off to the Newport Audi team.

<review>I abruptly was presented a situation for needing to purchase a car sooner than I expected. I've had my eyes set on Audi and visited two locations in Orange County. I recommend visiting Audi Newport Beach for several reasons, but most importantly the willingness to accommodate the customer. By far, Myles Ong, my rep took care of me. I love my new car and I could not be happier. I will certainly recommend to friends, family and coworkers this location, Myles specifically. Furthermore, I understand this location to be one of the largest Audi Dealerships in the nation, so from an inventory perspective I recommend looking at this Audi Dealership. Lastly, not only did I get the car I imagined, it included more "bells and whistles" than I expected.

<text>When I was growing up there was a super hero cartoon called Wonder Dog and he always showed up "To Save the Day"; well that's literally what happened with Patrick with Auto Nation/Newport Beach!  I had been working with two other dealers much closer to my home than Newport Beach to find the specific color and add ons for the right price for the Audi 5 Sportback that I was looking to buy.

The color was difficult to find with specific items that I wanted but I was working with two prior  salespersons that were pretty good but I guess at the end of the day, they weren't who I was intended to purchase my beautiful new vehicle from.  Patrick made this such a seamless process for me and within approximately two hours Patrick informed me that he had about three car options for me to pick from.  I spoke with Patrick around 11 a.m. and he waited for me to come to the dealership at little after 8 p.m. the same day.  I took one look at the first choice and knew that it was the one.  The car had all the bells and whistles that I wanted, Patrick's General Manager ensured that the price was something I couldn't walk away from and Kim Costello in financing made sure I understood and got everything that I needed for the longevity of my car.  Patrick and the entire Audi Newport Dealership were so supportive and empathetic to the frustration of car buying which made our purchase result in one of the best experiences I've ever experienced.

Since my purchase they haven't forgotten about me and have assured me that I can call them if I ever needed anything; which I have done so.  I'm so thankful that I was led to join the Newport Audi Family and look forward to doing business with them for many years to come.  Exceptional Customer Service is worth the Drive!< /text><user_name>Diamond Bell< /user_name><pictures>None<//pictures>< Gmap_id>

I've been in the market for a new Audi SUV for a couple weeks. After searching around for a bit, and even stopping by a couple other Audi dealerships... So glad I found Audi Newport Beach! Nothing compares to the experience, everything went extremely smooth. Ruschka was extremely intelligent, knowledgeable and efficient at working out the deal. Can't recommend her highly enough. She even drove to mission viejo herself to dealer swap my car because they had it in white. Great experience!

***Update 1 year later
Jose in the service department is amazing. I had a couple small issues in the car (rattling seatbelt internals while on the fwy). He found the problem when other people could not, fixed it, and had my car back to me in one day!

<review>Just moved to Orange County. Called Audi for service and fortunately ended up at Audi Newport Beach. My third Audi and never had better service or treated more respectfully and efficiently as I was by Corbin, Teri and the team at Newport Audi.

Being a retired Audi Service Advisor myself and a life long fan of Audi cars I consider myself a pretty tough critic of the dealership experience.

Audi Newport Beach is without a doubt one of the best. I initially was in contact by phone with Ruschka Sanguinetti who was extremely helpful, but since I dropped in without any notice on a very busy Saturday she introduced me to Chris Scales who was also fantastic. No pressure and very knowledgeable of the product. Considering I didn't have an appointment I was still able to leave the dealership in a reasonable amount of time with a brand new 2017 A4 that I absolutely love.

I would highly recommend Audi Newport Beach, Chris and Ruschka to anyone interested in an Audi. They're top notch!< /Text>

Audi Newport Beach is my favor  Audi dealer , even after  I moved to West Los Angeles, I still came back here for my Audi Q 7 services . One of the reason is Ryan , my service manager, he is the best .
I would recommend Ryan and Audi Newport Beach to anyone who looking to buy or services of their Audi.< /text>

I would give 0 stars but not an option...
Very slow communication response time. I called 3-4 times in 2 days before I could  get a return call to tell me what was happening with my vehicle. Even when another service person told me they put a note on R.R desk to call me back. Then once I received a call with the issues it took another 2 days to receive details. I had to ask for this to be emailed to me, which was but not in a detailed statement line itemed out (he was quoting me $6700 in repairs-I want to know specifics!) The detailed estimate took another 2 days to receive (I have heard this is illegal if not provided- why did I have to ask for it?) The pricing and labor charged by this Audi location is ridiculous. 3x higher on certain parts and labor...

Finally after I called to confirm the 85k service was performed (11 days of being at Audi), I clearly spoke to the service person RR on speaker phone so my husband could clearly hear it was apprx 7:45/8am.
R.R said yes the car was done with the 85k service update and nothing else was done he thought. Well obviously because we didn't authorize the over-priced work. I confirmed with RR ill pick it up around noon on at lunchtime. At 12:15/12:30 I arrived, a different service person was helping me and did his best but they couldn't find my car and it wasn't washed which is something I asked when I dropped it off, if they specifically did and was told yes by RR.

By this time the woman in charge came to meet me. She tried to smooth over the situation but my patience, trust and customer experience was completely ruined. Sadly this not knowing where the car is at, not being ready or washed no one having clear communication is the 2nd experience in a row with RR and with Audi Newport Beach. We will not be back, I DO NOT recommend this place for your Audi repairs.  They have ruined it for both myself and my husband (both long time Audi owners). We will not be back.</Text>

Great experience as always - Myles Ong had me out of my old A4 and into a new S5 in less than a week (I was the one who slowed it down due to travels!). Despite living much closer to Hoehn Audi in Carlsbad - I've always gone to Audi Newport for my past 3 Audis thanks to their great deals, amazing service and the great attention they give to customers. Myles was very communicative throughout, listened to what I wanted and got me the exact spec !! No haggling and no hard sell. Big banks to Myles, Jackson and the team.< /text>

<user>110304665962828669920</user><Review>Brad Cormier was a pleasure to work with. He is a true professional who made sure that we were well informed about the car and happy with every detail before and after we purchased the car. We bought a 2 year old Audi A4 Quattro. After shopping at other dealerships we felt that we received a very good deal for a beautifully maintained automobile. We were in and out of the dealership in less than two hours, which is very quick relative to the standard auto purchase.  Alex in the credit department was well organized and very quick with the entire process.  We were offered different options but there was never any high pressure selling by anyone at the dealership. If I purchase another Audi, it will be from this dealership.< /Review>< user_name>

<Rating>3<//Rating><review>Like any places you go to, it all depends on whom take care of you. Make sure you work with Genessis who is a super friendly and professional service advisor there. Ruschka was the one to help me on that day and was not having a good one as I didn't feel and get a good Audi-level experience.

I serviced my Q3 this weekend. Ruschka seemed very busy and frazzled and was worried about other customers than the one in front of her (me). I had questions she half answered because she was worried about other clients and she didn't inspire trust when providing half of her explanation. She was also very open at showing the disfunction in the shop in between parts and service advisors. I found that very unprofessional in front of customers who simply want to have a good experience.

When you go to Audi you expect top notch customer service and the little interaction I was lucky to have with Genessis was 100 times better than what I got with Ruschka.< /review>< Pics>

Before I tell my story, I want to tell you (reader) to look no further than Alex Beitz for your Audi purchasing experience.

I found the car I wanted at Audi NB, but I live in San Diego.  I looked up Yelp reviews, like you're doing right now, and counted which salesperson had the most positive stories from customers.  Alex had a ton.  I called the dealership and asked for Alex.  Alex and I talked about the car, the car buying process, and we worked together to get everything done over the phone/ internet so all I had to do was drive to NB, drive the car, and sign the final papers. The whole buying process was simple and efficient and I left the dealership a very happy Audi owner.  Usually the story stops there, not with Alex.  Alex reached out to me a few times during the first month of ownership and wanted to make sure I was enjoying my car and that everything was going well.  He even said "my job doesn't stop once you leave the dealership", and he has certainly been a man of his word and has gone above and beyond any car purchasing experience I've had.  Thank you Alex, and Audi Newport Beach, I'll certainly be back.<//Review>

I was very pleased and happy with sales and service department. Service dept. was busy, even though they adjust my service schedule timely manner so I don't have to make another  trip. They did detail inspection for my new car and service what is needs, as car was not use for longer period.
Mr. Alex Hamlin in service dept. is very great person and very helpful, whatever I said is too sort for him, really good person work with him. Also on sale side Mr. Mike and Mr. Jalal kawa also very good person, helps very good  for your needs and never force to sale any. They try to help as much as possible to fulfill our requirement on timely manner. I don't have more STAR than 5, other wise I can gave 10 Start to all triple group service and sales. Suggest to go(visit) this dealer  to all , all will be treated as family, friends. You will fill  happy visit. weather you buy car or not.       ---

<Review>Scott Conner and Jalal Kawa made my shopping experience for a new car smooth and painless. Jalal was very helpful explaining each model of the A3 snd A4 and made sure I test drove each model. I don't particularly like going through the whole process of getting a new car and they both helped make it a great experience. This is my first Audi and my husband's second.  I love my new 2017 A4. Thank you to the team for all the help.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Review>I just leased a 2015 Lava Gray SQ5. I have been shopping around for almost a month, and all it took is one quick call this morning where I was given exactly what I asked for and more. They helped me get out of my existing lease with Audi, which was a 2013 S5, and took $5000 off the MSRP which put the new car at just below invoice. 60k for 55k. Best part was I arrived there at 1pm and was driving home in my new SQ5 in less than an hour. That is unheard of, usually I would spend 3 hours minimum going back and forth, and go home with a headache from all the negotiations. Not here!! I left with a big smile, energized and felt like I hit the jackpot.  Special appreciation to one or their top sales guys Bob, their courteous and efficient finance manager Alexzander, and especially their general manager Evan. If you are looking for an Audi, know what you want and expect, and want an in and out experience without car sales pressure and politics, this is the classiest dealership you will ever visit. It felt similar to visiting a 5 star hotel or restaurant and being given Michelin star service ( French rating system for restaurants). I am already excited to go back and get a 2nd Audi. Great job to those guys and thank you for not making me feel like you are just another car dealership and I am just another customer.<//Review><Resp>None</Resp><UserId.>106190618862810974939<//UserId.><rate>5<//rate><time>1420843949960</time></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I was happy with my experience of getting new car at Audi Newport Beach.  Jalal Kawa was very helpful and knowledgeable.  Jalal and Alex Beitz, manager, were very accommodating and gave me a good deal.  Thanks.
UPDATED - I was promised that any balance from my previous lease with audi financial would be "taken care off".  However, it's now 6 months later after many calls and emails to the deal, the balance was not completely "taken care off" and the remaining balance was sent to collection.< /Text><user_id>109888263930932937711< /user_id>< Rate>

Terrible! Our family had walked in, claimed an Audi, and then somebody walks in and takes the car!
We went with the sale agent to a different location to see the car and drove it back to the dealership, we were never told that we need to hold the car.
While we were checking the car, they have another customer test drive the car and ended up closing the deal with the other customer without even asking us if we want to buy the car.
It was very bad experience.
I would not recommend this dealership.</Text>

Ruschka Sanguinetti was great!  I ended up at this dealership after leaving a few others because I wasn't pleased with the service and clarity of information I was being given.  But I got more info from Ruschka after speaking to her for 3 minutes than I did after an hour at the other places.  She was so straightforward and down to earth, even negotiating over the price was painfree.  I definitely recommend her for anyone who dreads the idea of a sleazy salesman- she was the farthest from it you could ever find.</text>

<userid>103681253782103773150<//userid><Review>I dont think the Audi dealer could have messed up more for me.

They sold me the wrong car
The right car had a rat living under it that ate all the electrical wires
After the wires were fixed, an engine part that was on recall wasnt fixed before they sold the car and the engine was shaking a lot.
Then I found out they gave me the wrong license plate.

For the selling the wrong car, I said I wanted the 4wd drive used white A6 with 4,793 miles with sports package, etc. They only had 3 A6 used vehicles on the lot and 2 were white with same exterior and interior, but the one they sold me was only 2wd, didnt have the back up camera, navigation, keyless entry and had 8,000 miles. Luckily I noticed within 2 hours and got it swapped out.

For the license plate issue, I contacted them by phone, email, and in person. I talked to the sales manager personally and told him I was being ignored and no one was helping me fix the issue. He said he would get back to me and let me know. He was given my email and phone. No follow up! I was told by the DMV that they had a legal responsibility to guide me through what to do and to help me under some law. What crappy customer service!</Review>< GmapID>

Prior to visiting the Audi Newport Beach Dealership, i went online and checked out their inventory. So, when i visited the dealership, i had an idead what i was looking for. Upon arriving, Steve Hansler approached my dad and i to see if he could be of any assistance. I told him that there where a couple of cars i saw online that i wanted to see and he gladly took us to their 2nd lot. Even though i did some research Steve told me exactly what each car was equipped with, with their different packages and all. After a test drive, we went back to talk numbers. And that's exactly what we did, we talked. He gave us a price and we obviously gave him our price. What i liked about Steve and his GM, was that, even though we both haggled, he never made us feel like "this isnt the car for us". Another dealership actually told us that maybe this car wasn't the car we where looking for (we gladly walked away from that dealership). Even with my trade-in, Steve gave us the best price. Long story short, Steve and the Audi Newport Dealership treated us like real people and we never felt like they looked at us as price tag. I truly would recommend this Dealership to anyone looking for a car. Thanks Steve and to the rest of the Staff of making my first Audi purchase pleasant and memorable. i'll see you guys when i'm ready to upgrade, in a few years of course! :)< /text>

I worked with Sasha Poleshuck for about 3 weeks solely through email because I was gone on deployment and was not able to talk through phone. He consistantly kept in touch and was sending me offers on a NEW 2015 Audi A3 2.0T Quattro to accommodate my budget. He was able to beat all competitors within a 100 mile radius of Irvine. The day after I pulled in from deployment he had an offer for a car that was not even at the Newport dealership he went to go pick it up and met me in Newport to show it to me. It was everything I wanted in the car plus more, he was able to find the car with a Bang & Olufsen sounds system that didn't jack up the price. I was able to walk in there and not get haggled and see the car, test drive it, and sign all the paperwork within 2 hours. I would recommend Sasha Poleshuck in the future due to his excellent customer service and interpersonal skills. I hated car buying but after this experience there is hope. Financing was also easy.</Review>

I've bought two Audi's from Tyson Toeller in the last year and each experience has been bliss. (We've owned 6 Audi's before and each purchasing experience with a different dealership wasn't the best.) I bought an S4 (dream car) and a Q5 Tdi (Second dream car). Tyson is knowledgeable (he knows the in's and out's of EVERY SINGLE AUDI), he's tidy, punctual, listens to what you want and above all get's you the car of your dreams for a great price! Tyson came into work on his day off just to make sure my car arrived in pristine condition (brand new, shipped on a boat) and got it ready for me to pick up the next day. I've recommended Tyson to my parents as well as friends and he has made each experience unique and wonderful. My entire family drives Audi's because Tyson makes the experience of purchasing an Audi down right amazing. He's my go to guy and should be yours too!<//review>

<text>Disappointed that when I picked up my car that is was not washed nor detailed. My service required that I leave the car overnight for two nights.  The car was parked outside where tree debris made my car very dirty. The car was clean when it was brought in and to have it returned to me in a worse condition than when I dropped it off is very disappointing, especially after spending so much money in service.<//text></record>
