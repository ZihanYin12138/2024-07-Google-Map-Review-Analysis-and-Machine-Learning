< Review>
Love this gym! Been taking my daughter here for a couple weeks now and couldn’t ask for a better place to bring her to let her energy out, learn some skills, and socialize with kids around her age. The staff is amazing. Mr. Ray really goes above and beyond expectations of an instructor, and makes sure my daughter feels comfortable the whole time. I love how clean and well kept the gym is, and they have plenty for the kids to do/play with or on. So glad I found this gym!</Review>

<review>So thankful we found MyGym! We have a drive (nothing for kids in our area) but it’s worth it! They have so much for my daughter to do, then add in the structure of the classes and it’s such a fun experience for my daughter. We love our classes with Mr. Ray, Mr. Josh and Mr. Roberto. They always help my daughter and make sure she’s included as I carry my other little one. You can tell they love what they do. They make it such an exciting, special experience for the kids, and parents too! Highly recommend!!</review>< Time>

< Review>
Our little girl has been going to My Gym for a couple of months now and she is almost 2 1/2. She and we absolutely LOVE IT!!!! The My Gym staff members are so professional, fun, clean, and you can really tell the love helping children grow. It’s a wonderful place and has really helped keep our little one busy and nap times after her class are longer and she feels better.< /Review>

We’ve been loyal members of My Gym in Elk Grove for five fun years. Both of my kids love the activities and I’ve seen them gain confidence in their physical and social skills.  The instructors are fun, encouraging and really get to know your children. They clearly enjoy their job.  My kids and I adore Mr. Doug, Miss Bria and Mr. Ray.  I work full time Monday thru Friday and appreciate that there are many classes that work with my schedule.< /review>

<Review>Love this place.  My daughter,  who is usually surrounded by adults, was very shy with other children to start with.  Within a month,  i could see lots of progress.  She is sharing,  playing with children,  and being more adventurous.  The staff genuinely cares.  Lots of one on one time with the children in class and open gym.  I highly recommend a place like this for young children.  Good cooperation, sharing,  self motivation, interpersonal,  and developmental skills taught here.<//Review>< pics>

<review>My daughter has been going here for two years. It's a nice gym and you get to meet some awesome parents and kids. I really love it. But I wish the instructors were more interacting.

My daughter has a great time when she goes! She even sometimes cry when it is time to leave. I put her into this summer program for her to learn social skills being that she is an only child and so far she is doing okay. With the help of the staff i'm sure she will continue to not only learn structure but interact with the other children really well.  A huge plus is that the staff actually cares! My daughter really loves coming here!</Text>

<Text>I love this business and all of the employees.  Being a special needs parent I would like to praise the Elk Grove team for their support and genuine love for the kids.  Prior to joining My Gym my son was in a different gymnastics studio.  The teacher my son was assigned to was unhappy with her job and it was very obvious.  She attempted to play it off but unfortunately many of the parents could obviously see it.  Personally, there's nothing worse than feeling like someone doesn't want to be around your child. I will be recommending My Gym for sure!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Love this place.  My daughter,  who is usually surrounded by adults, was very shy with other children to start with.  Within a month,  i could see lots of progress.  She is sharing,  playing with children,  and being more adventurous.  The staff genuinely cares.  Lots of one on one time with the children in class and open gym.  I highly recommend a place like this for young children.  Good cooperation, sharing,  self motivation, interpersonal,  and developmental skills taught here.< /Review>

My daughter has been going here for two years. It's a nice gym and you get to meet some awesome parents and kids. I really love it. But I wish the instructors were more interacting. I love Miss tenley. She's the best.<//Review>

<Review>My daughter has a great time when she goes! She even sometimes cry when it is time to leave. I put her into this summer program for her to learn social skills being that she is an only child and so far she is doing okay. With the help of the staff i'm sure she will continue to not only learn structure but interact with the other children really well.  A huge plus is that the staff actually cares! My daughter really loves coming here!< /Review><user_name>Nini Griffin< /user_name><Rating>5<//Rating><Response>None</Response><Date>1437252682941< /Date></record>

<Response>None< /Response><Name>Diana Patterson<//Name><Review>I love this business and all of the employees.  Being a special needs parent I would like to praise the Elk Grove team for their support and genuine love for the kids.  Prior to joining My Gym my son was in a different gymnastics studio.  The teacher my son was assigned to was unhappy with her job and it was very obvious.  She attempted to play it off but unfortunately many of the parents could obviously see it.  Personally, there's nothing worse than feeling like someone doesn't want to be around your child. I will be recommending My Gym for sure!< /Review>< rate>

Amazing customer service. Used them as a middle man for an FFL transaction and ended up buying several parts for my build as well. The worker threw in an extra part free of charge and gave some advice for the build. Would recommend for anyone local needing a firearm or purchasing one needing transfer services.<//Text>

There was a strong vibration when driving my 4Runner at speeds over 40mph. Dustin replaced the U-Joints which solved the issue, and also replaced the car battery which was dead, all at a very fair price. A+ Service! I highly recommend this shop< /review>

< Review>
I recently ran over a nail in almost brand new large truck tires, luckily it was not through the sidewall. I decided to call Valley Tire & Tackle in Fort Jones to see if they had time and the ability to repair my tire. They said it would be super quick and that yes they could fix it for around $10+ dollars.

So I went in around 45 minutes later. They quickly took the truck back into the shop and went about removing the tire and getting to work. After about 15 minutes they were done. They brought my truck back out front and told me no charge - on the house this time. So I gave the worker who helped a few dollars as a tip.

Overall, my first experience with them was fantastic. Customer service was outstanding, price (if I paid) was more than reasonable, and its local which I love to support where possible. I recommend giving these guys a call first before heading up to Medford or Yreka - give them a chance to earn your business. I will be returning.</Review>

I was refused dervice to balance tires because the tires were purchased online. I was told "we lose business if you don't buy the tires here". Well, he lost business anyway.

I am very disaappointed to be treated by a business this way in this very small community.</Review>

<text>My husband and I have been going to Dr. Andrea Joy Smith for over 20 years. Not only is she a great dentist, but she's a wonderful, kind person. She went out of her way to help our elderly parents feel comfortable in her office. We would highly recommend Dr. Smith and her staff!</text>< pictures>

Dr. Smith is an excellent dentist who puts you at ease and makes sure you understand everything. Her staff is friendly and professional, and take the time to explain each procedure. I highly recommend her! They are providing quality service at reasonable prices.<//Review>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>I feel the dentist is extremely busy.  She needs to bring on other dentist,  or take less patients so we can have more time to be consulted.  This is a major life changing procedure,  and to walk in check my teeth, and walk out and have someone else bring the estimate for the procedure did not make me feel comfortable.  I don't think she will allocate the right amount of time for the procedure.   She will probably rush it, and I'm not comfortable with that. Some of the equipment was a bit dusty, and dirty, and  the cost was a bit more expensive than what I was anticipating.   I found a dentist that will do implants for $3000.00. I was being estimated $2600.
Not impressed,  but more importantly,  I just didn't feel comfortable.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

Very professional service, I highly recommend this place. Everyone who works there are very friendly. My experience was very pleasant. I did not had to hassle.

I have been going to Dr Andrea Joy Smith for several years now and I’ve never had a better experience from the moment I walk through the door. Everyone is friendly. I’ve never experienced such a caring Dr. she explains everything in detail and ensures that I understand. She definitely has the compassion and kindness that anyone who’s uneasy about the process. I don’t live in the area but I drive without hesitation. I highly recommend. My smile has never been so beautiful 😃< /Text>

I felt quite comfortable with the staff and Dr Smith's capabilities to completely follow me through any procedure of tooth removable which gladly I had a tooth implant to still help my chewing issues.
Dr Andrea Joy Smith is really professional to your experience to be sure you will return for the complete process.</review>

<Text>Coming to Sacramento from Reno wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be.   Moving up the road from Dr. Smith's was meant to be,  I only had to drive down pass her office.      After a couple of visits,  I wasn't sure until Dr. Smith stepped in and put her experience, compassion, knowledge, and most of all understanding of ones reluctance to Dentist making me feel comfortable.     In my seasoned 64 years I'll have to say Dr. Smith is without doubt #1 in my orbit.          Thank you.   Robb (Stormyy) Cummings.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

<Review>I had my first visit with Dr. Andrea Joy Smith. I have had a missing tooth for about 5 years. I had a partial retainer & it was thrown away by mistake. I watched a YouTube video that Dr. Andrea had posted on her website. I felt at ease after listening to her explain mini implants. I was able to get a visit within a week. The staff is great! When I finally met Dr. Andrea, she was the sweetest dentist EVER! She put me at ease right away & told me that she could do an implant. I was so happy. So glad I made an appointment & I can’t wait to get my implant.</Review><GmapID>0x809adbf5a1c5bf65:0xe219f586f2bb4a66</GmapID><rating>5</rating>< name>

I would recommend this office because of how hard they work to make sure their patients are happy.  The Dr. Smith goes beyond to the call to make sure of this.  I am always impress of how long her staff has worked for her, that really says a lot about the Doctor.  When you get to know the staff, they are all very kind and professional.  Can only give a five star and nothing less.</Text>

Dr. Andrea Smith is truly the best that there is! I had been in desperate need of implants for over 10 years and simply dreaded it. But immediately upon meeting Dr. Smith who has the most endearing and warm spirit, I felt relieved and unafraid. Needless to say, I received my implants and the procedure was seamless. Felt 100% the very next day with no swelling or pain and, of course, a beautiful smile. It was truly a miracle! Highly recommended to anyone worried about dental surgery. I promise you won't be disappointed!<//review>

I have received great care here. I have had short wait times to get appointments and into see doctor quickly. Even though my initial implants were not provided here Dr Smith has given me great follow up care and improved on some of the initial treatment. I would strongly recommend her to anyone looking to improve their quality of life with implants.<//review>

I went to see Dr. Andrea Smith for an estimate/consultation on getting some partial implants. Her office is very professional and dr Smith was very kind and knowledgeable about the process I was interested in. Cost seems better than others I have gotten. Looking forward to getting started.

The office staff was very professional and warm. They actually cared about my needs. Very communicative office and responsive. Dr. Smith is just a person who makes you feel at home and one of the family. She radiates trust, honesty and integrity. I feel safe in her care. I have found a new home for my dental care.< /Text>

I had my first appointment yesterday. The staff was great so nice and friendly.  Then meeting the dentist Andrea Joy Smith was wonderful she answered all my questions and made me feel at ease. Best dental experience I have had in a long time. I am so glad I found her.<//text>

The staff was warm, welcoming and my entire visit was pleasant. I have suffered from dental anxiety since childhood due to traumatic experiences from dentists. Dr. Smith has a caring spirit and explained the process thoroughly. She is curing my dental anxiety, while restoring my smile!<//Review>

<Review>My girlfriend recommended Dr Smith to me.  At the time my mouth was a mess. I never really smiled much. Through time and numerous visits I can say I do smile now thanks to the professional work of Dr. Smith and her staff.  And speaking of the staff they are the most helpful group of people who do a service for others that I have come in contact with besides my regular MD. I highly recommend Dr. Smith to anyone needing dental services<//Review>< time>

<text>I discovered Dr. Andrea Joy Smith one morning  watching TV. After watching her explain about the implants I was so excited to go in for a consultation! I didn't wait long before being called back which is always nice. Everything was clean and accessible for patient care and I was treated like a VIP the whole time. Dr. Andrea is very knowledgeable and therefore explained everything very clearly. Once I had the procedure done, staff checked in with me several times after going home. I really appreciated staff being so attentive to my recovery! I followed the aftercare instructions closely and recovered just fine. I really appreciate the excellent treatment and great experience with Dr. Andrea and her staff. I've never been so happy to go to a dentist appointment! If you're considering dental implants or any other procedures the office offers, I highly recommend seeing Dr. Andrea Joy Smith. Thank you Dr. Andrea!<//text><gmap_id>0x809adbf5a1c5bf65:0xe219f586f2bb4a66< /gmap_id><Rating>5<//Rating><response>None</response><user>115772373332865891916</user>< time>

Fearing going to the Dentist?  This was me until I came here ,  this is a pain free Dental office .  They take the time to explain the procedures and make sure you’re comfortable,  and with my fear of the drill and needles.....  especially for a major procedure that makes being sedated the only way to go !  Thanks Dr. Smith and staff for a job well done 👍🏽< /Review>

<Review>As ever Dr Smith was amazing. After my husband suffered through a botched surgery at a different dental practice this morning, Dr Smith was kind enough to fit him into her schedule and accomplish what should have been done during the first dentist visit. Dr Smith was gentle, efficient, professional, and she’ll be the only dentist he goes to from now on. Thanks to her wonderful staff and her brilliant and kind practice it’s the only dentist I would ever visit either. And I suffer from a serious dentist phobia. Dr. Smith and her staff are the only ones who alleviate my fears. Hands down this is the best dental practice in Sacramento.

Follow up for 2/12/2020
Since Dr Smith is concentrating on her implant patients she has now hired a new dentist. Her name is Dr Basrai and she is very knowledgeable and gentle. I’m extremely phobic when it comes to dentists but she put me at ease. She is very thorough and I highly recommend this dentistry!

Dr. Smith and Annette  are a dynamic dou! Let’s start with Annette as she is vey kind, knowledgeable, and has good energy! But more than that, she is amazing at her job! My teeth still feel good. I’ve never had my teeth polished using her technique but it was very effective and there was no pain involved! As for Dr. Smith, she is a very pleasant and skilled dentist with a gentle touch. Also, I appreciate her explaining what’s going on with my teeth and acknowledging my efforts to keep my teeth and mouth healthy! More importantly, I never feel judged and she does not try and up-sale her patients!  Lastly, Dr. Smith utilizes the latest dental technology, the wait time is minimal, and the office is very calm and inviting! I can’t wait for my next scheduled cleaning! 😊</Text>

I believe that there are a lot of people being processed through for services, and  more than a few times it seems things are not completely given clarity such as what next steps will be, is my dental care in final stage or are there more steps to complete, just this week one person said one thing was to be checked, and in came another person  and said okay..you can leave now. Additionally, why is it I paid for services completed, and my insurance paid for same services in proportion.  I'd like more clarity in process... that's just me...so I can realize what I'm doing and what they are doing as well.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Review>This appointment was a special experience to the continued professional quality I have grown use to from Doctor Smith's office.

The payments and payment schedule were manageable.

The pre-procedure orientation was explained and understood.

Sedation was introduced and applied.

The procedure was completed and explained with clinical care.<//Review>< pics>

Dr. Smith is without a doubt the best Dentist l have ever had. She is knowledgeable, gentle and just a great person to be around. Didn't know that going to the Dentist could be this pleasant! The entire staff is so helpful and cheerful. My Keyhole surgery was a great success. Highly recommend it!</review>

<rating>1< /rating><review>Having waited 1 he 25 minutes I was finally seen. After a 20 minute assessment was told that I would be a great candidate for the pinpoint him procedure. That I could expect to see results. A financial statement would be calculated. The cost to my 2 insurance policies would be$4000.00 which would leave me $4000.00 out of pocket or more if I went with Botox injections. I called the office to see if they could just do the upper quadrants for the $4000.00 of insurance
Or would I still be obligated to half. I never received a call back. I really don't feel comfortable with the disorganized quality of this office. Not what I am looking for in a professional organization.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<review>It had been YEARS since I’ve been to a dentist!  My Mom recommended Dr Smith and her staff, and she was AMAZING!!  I had to have some extractions done and was extremely nervous. Dr Smith and her staff made sure that I was relaxed, comfortable, and felt no pain.  I still have a lot of work ahead to get a healthy mouth and teeth, but I know I am in good hands with Dr Andrea Joy Smith and her amazing staff!   Thank You!!!< /review>< Pictures>

<text>I lost my upper teeth in an accident in my 30’s and it was truly one of the worst things I’ve been through. I had a bad experience a few years back and I was worried that implants were just not going to be an option for me. I was convinced that I would just wear a denture for the rest of my life. I met Dr. Smith after seeing an ad on TV. She took care to ensure that I was a good candidate then explained the process to me thoroughly before I made my decision. The staff helped me figure out the best treatment plan for me based on my needs and my wallet.

A full replacement of my upper teeth was more expensive than I really wanted to pay but once I compared the cost of mini implants to regular implants, I was convinced it was worth it. I decided on the nicest material because I really wanted them to look natural and stay with me for a long time.

The process wasn’t perfectly easy, there was some problems with my temporary bite and it caused some extra visits. My temporary broke on Christmas Eve and I called the answering service. Someone met me at the office within 30 minutes and spent hours fixing my temporary and ensuring that I could eat Christmas dinner with my family. It was a huge deal to me. I chose sedation for the initial procedure and it was way easier than I thought it would be. Pain was minimal after the procedure was done on Saturday I was back at work on Monday.

After about 6 weeks from the start I have the kind of teeth that people notice and make comments about. Teeth that I can actually eat with. I am so proud of my new smile and I actually open my mouth to talk.

Anyone can write a review about their dentist but Its impossible for me to express exactly what this process has done for me and how well I have been treated by everyone at Dr.  Smith’s office. I still get emotional just thinking about where I started and where I am now after just a couple of months.

I know this is your business but my wife and I will never forget what you have done for us.

< Review>
While it’s way to early to tell if the PST will deliver the desired results, I couldn’t be more pleased with Dr. Smith and her staff. Dr. Smith goes the extra mile. She helped with reducing some cost when she didn’t have to. Something my personal dentist of 35 years or so has never done, that I can recall.
I felt that not only was I going to a very good dentist, I met a new friend. Her staff was great and helped make me feel at ease. I only wish her practice was closer to home.
My wife who went with me and is in need of an implant was given consideration in the form of X-rays and evaluation at no expense to us.
I would highly recommend Dr. Smith to anyone in need of the many procedures she can provide.
We also met her husband who drove us back to the motel of which I remember little if anything. Being from the same state, he took the time to introduce  himself prior to my PST and implant which was done during the same time frame. I had very little pain and really think I didn’t need the three Advil I took afterwards.
You can’t go wrong if your in need of dental services.< /Review>

<Text>This is probably one of the most pleasant and professional office I have experienced and that saying a lot since I worked in the dental field years ago.

Dr Smith goes beyond the call to make sure her patients are happy.  The fact that her staff has been with her for years says a lot about the kind of person she is even as an employer.
My experience is always good when I come in.<//Text><resp>None< /resp><Name>Yolanda Florez<//Name><Gmap_id>0x809adbf5a1c5bf65:0xe219f586f2bb4a66</Gmap_id><Rating>5</Rating>< UserId.>

Dr Smith and her team are the best! We are never waiting more than 3 mins to be called in. My 11 year old doesn't love having her teeth cleaned but she is not afraid of the dentist like many adults I know. This is because of Dr. Smith's warm demeanor and gentle touch.<//review>

<text>Dr. Joy Smith is an a amazing dentist.  She was able to place an implant with success in an area of my mouth that a previous implant from another dental practice had failed.  She really cares a great deal about her clients.  They are a very busy office but I never feel like I do not know what is going on.  There can be a wait at times but because of the deep knowledge, years of experience and great care Dr. Joy Smith has taken with me I would highly recommend her services.  Hope you find her to be as great a dentist as I have.<//text>< Pictures>

Dr. Smith saved me from undergoing unnecessary dental procedures and also saved me a great deal of money.  She is very knowledgeable, loves what she does, and I feel blessed to have her as my dentist.  Also, her staff is very professional and kind.<//Text>

5 Star Rating!! One of the best dentist you’ll ever find. You can trust her. The  staff is very friendly.  I highly recommend Dr. Andrea Joy Smith for your dental work. On 8/28/2020 I went in had  some work done. People she is the BEST in Sacramento , CA.  She’s well worth it! She put a smile back on my face. I need a lot of work done and I keep on coming back.  My most recent  visit to Dr. Andrea Joy Smith on 10/1/2020. She is so good at what she does. I will continue to use her service in the future.</Text>

That was my first visit to Dr. Andrea Smith. I need a hygiene appointment and a general consultation since a need some teeth work to be done in the near future. Sandy from the front office was welcoming and friendly and Jacky, the hygienist was competent, gentle and concerned if I was having  any pain throughout the cleaning process. Dr. Andrea is a very nice person, friendly,  knowledgeable in her field and very easy to talk with. She answered all my questions in a easy way to understand (showing some pictures and explaining some brochures) about futures treatments options that I want to have done in my mouth.Overall I was very happy with my visit.< /text>

< Review>
I was seen very quickly ! I love the atmosphere and the people were very friendly!    Prices are just right and financing is available 😊  My whole life was changed!!!   Nothing is more important then a first  impression!   I was so worried about what people thought of me because of my missing teeth.  Now I don't have those worries anymore.   Thanks Dr Joy Smith !!!    I don't even have the words to express how grateful and extremely happy I am.   It's amazing to be able to face people with confidence.   Especially the line of work I am in.  I will always appreciate the work you have done for me.     Thank you for my second chance!!!!!   I will take great care of my implants.    I can't stop looking st them !   They look great !!< /Review>

From the time my husband and I entered the door, we were greeted with kindness, professionalism. Because I am such a coward when it comes to dentistal work which I truly need, from the dental assistant to my first exam with Dr. Brasai, I was catered to and reasured that I would receive the best of care and it truly eased my nervousness. Currently I am waiting to start a treatment plan which I am excited about and looking forward to starting and completing all my dental needs. I truly encouraged others who are having dental issues,  please consider coming to Dr Andrea Joy Smith dental office. A church member referred me and I'm so thankful she did!</Review>

Wonderful, as always - Dr Smith and Staff as good as they get! Great Dentist and a better human being.  She has worked with me to get a great smile after a  lifetime of not having one...she worked with me in every way, she listened to my hopes and my budget and created a plan that worked beautifully.  Thank you Dr. Smith - that is why I drive 4 hours just to keep her as my dentist.  The best!< /review>

Getting the implants was a pain free process the whole time. I really appreciate Dr Smith and all the staff for a no judgement environment. I would recommend them to anyone that is avoiding the dentist or looking for a friendly place to go. It’s worth it and very happy with the results. Thank you for all the help.<//review>< user>

Dr. Joy is hands down the best dentist in all of Sacramento. If you were like me and are afraid of the numbing needle, trust me when I say you have nothing to worry about!</Text>

Dr. Smith has been my dentist for over 18 years. She is honest, caring, and always upbeat and positive. Finding a dentist who is honest and doesn't overcharge is invaluable. We are blessed to have found this in Dr. Smith.<//text>

I live in the Bay Area and I travel to Sacramento to see Dr. Smith. I have been her patient for over 11 years and no matter where I live in California, I make the trip to see Dr. Smith. Family n friends all think I'm crazy and try to recommend other dentists but none of them live up to Dr. Smith.

I have a severe phobia of dentists, struggle with anxiety and have a panic attack disorder. Dr. Smith's sedation services make dentistry possible for me despite my limitations. Other sedation dentists want to use IV sedation but Dr. Smith only uses the most minimally evasive options in all her work, including sedation. I know I'm a difficult patient but Dr. Smith makes me feel like her favorite patient and I am so grateful to have a dentist like her.

I tell her all the time, "If it wasn't for you, I would have no teeth." She smiles n laughs but it's true! No matter what it is that's keeping you from the dentist...fear, embarrassment, anxiety, or any other medical condition...you don't need to live in pain. Dr. Smith can and will fix it because everyone deserves to smile<//review>

<Review>I had my first visit with Dr. Smith today.  Dr. Smith is very knowledgeable about treatment options that I didn't know about before.  She began a treatment with me right away to help  with my chronic pain.  I was there for a consultation and she went above and beyond anything I have experienced before at other dentists.  I am so grateful.   She is very focused on what my individual needs are.  Her staff are also very professional and kind.</Review>< Rating>

I've had a very troubled tooth, receeding gum and had worried a root canal may be in order. Dr. Smith and her team have worked diligently to help me save my tooth and it worked. I recommend Pinhole Surgery by her, great rate and excellent support and service!</Text>

<text>This has been a great dental experience I really feel spoiled regardless of my insurance.  Dr. Smith and her staff really takes care of you.  I want to move but her dental care has become a reason not to...  How will I find another dentist who truly cares about your teeth and your smile.</text>< name>

<Text>I've had a rough time with my teeth, no insurance,years of pain med prescriptions (which are horrible for teeth) and not a lot of money. I've seen many dentists but none like Dr Smith. The first time she saw me was for a dental emergency..I was so worried about missing a tooth when I smile and she made sure that did NOT happen. So now I'm a patient here. I do not worry, despite paying because the staff is so friendly, the dentists so thorough, and the pressure non existent. They even referred me to an insurance carrier that's helping with the costs as I need a LOT of work. I needed a good dentist, who was going to listen and help. I found that here.</Text>< user_name>

<review>Dr. Smith is by far the best denist I have ever had. I have recommended many of my family and friends to her and all of them have are very satisfied with her work as we all know it takes more than good work to be a denist it also helps if you are a good person and she certainly is that and her staff are great too. Keep up the good work....Gary and Sunita Penny</review><userid>109613387149976250636< /userid><time>1494352979082<//time><Resp>None<//Resp>< Rating>

<rating>5</rating><text>smooth as boston cream pie the staff is so kind  so professional and so efficient as for andrea such a lovely person  so refined so experienced she makes her job look easy. she made me feel so at ease through a very scary procedure. the passion and dedication she displays in the work she does  is second only to honesty and integrity she displays as a person. when i am sitting there in the dentists chair along with andrea and her staff it gives me that down home feeling , you know the kind you get when  youre coming home for the holidays and sitting down for some good home cooking with family and friends.if it sounds like i cant say enough great things about these people ...youre right  i cant!!!   tell your family tell your friends TELL THE WORLD all about this wonderful place ! i know i am.I'M TELLING YOU NOW!!!!<//text>< Pics>

They were fast to get u a spot even though when first walking they were full of people. Don't talk much but nothing wrong with it. Except a lady customer in the corner with no mask sneezing they didn't tell her to leave.<//text>

Worst nail salon experience ever! This photo is the end result of a $44 #2 spa pedicure! I'm a returning costumer to both salons #1 & #2 until today! The woman who gave the manicure obviously did not want to be there....She was very rough, rude, and cut me 3x....IDK if she was having difficulty seeing or staying awake (both) she clipped my big toe nail half off by accident. Ran over and grabbed the acrylic and tried covering it! No apology was given by her or staff in charge. Still in disbelief! VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!<//Text>

< Review>
First and last time at this salon. They're not friendly at all. Not one nail was the same size as the rest. My index finger was crooked.. there was a bunch acrylic power underneath another nail. He never had me wash my hand so dust was trapped under the gel polish and I told him but he didn't listen and put my hand under the light anyway. I showed him the shape I wanted on their chart and he just went ahead and did square. When I asked him if he was going to do the shape I asked for, he raised his voice and said yeah but still didn't do it. I ended up just paying for horrible service and nails and had to pay to get them redone somewhere else.
Also paid for my daughter to get her nails painted with gel so it would last a little longer.. but the other guy didn't paint them completely and you could still see her nail through the polish on a few fingers.< /Review>

<Text>Worst place to get your nails or wax done. This place is full of rude people and unskilled workers, most of them either don’t speak English or they just don’t care about what you ask them to do. They have bad attitudes, laugh at you amongst and because it’s all in their language, you don’t know what’s going on. Service is bad, overpriced. Lumpy nails. I can go on all day. Stay away from here and save your money.</Text><Rating>1</Rating>< Name>

Their manicures and pedicures are great! The people that work there are some of the nicest people I know. Someone always greets you as you walk in. They are kind and very respectful.<//Review>

<Text>My friend and I went to JK Nails & Spa to get ourselves gel manicures and I was very satisfied with the end result. The service was friendly, they did a great job on the manicures and nothing was rushed. It was a very pleasant and professional experience and I intend to go there again.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80daf7ee9f6514db:0xf603ab16c6f926f4</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I had called in asking for a wait time, they mentioned to come in with no wait time. Once I arrived, two people came in after me and were called first than I. Not a good first impression.</Review>

Worst place ever, DO NOT come to get your nails done. The lady who did my nails filed my nails too much and cut three of my fingers, she left my nails all crooked and thick, plus she was filing my nails too rough, she also did a poor job painting my nails.<//review>

We are working With Mariah, our leasing agent.She is helping us to do a smooth transition from one apartment to another. We were nervous about the whole move,  but she has been extremely patient and understanding of our family. We appreciate her help and are happy to still be tenants here for going on 2 years. We love the outdoor area, we love that it's dog friendly,  we love that maintenence comes day of request within hours, we love that we have a clean pool. Thank you Mariah for everything.  You are appreciated by our family.

<username>Noah</username>< review>
I am active duty military and my wife and I have been with these apartments for about 3 years and the experience none the less was disappointing and frustrating . I HIGHLY do not recommend military families that are on a waiting list for military housing to live here because they will not work with you . I recently got accepted to move into military housing within a two week notice , me and my wife have been waiting for months and we got accepted way earlier than expected. These apartments have a minimum of a 60 day notice before you can leave (which is ridiculous and unheard of) and instead of helping long standing loyal residents and understanding our situation we will have to pay 2 whole months of rent while already living in our new home . On top of that , these apartments are asking way too much for rent for not even covering utilities, your best bet is just turning your head from this place and looking somewhere else . Especially MILITARY FAMILIES , they do not care about you, just your money and won’t help you unless you have legal documents to back you up .<//review>

I live in this community for the past 1 year, this place is a good place to live, in comparison to the other apartments complex in this area.
Doyin is the most professional person I can remember had interacted with. The other people in the office are nice but I prefer to talk to Doyin, she complements this place!<//Review>

The current manager Christy is one of the worts persona I have ever worked with in my personal and professional life, and that’s saying a lot being a service advisor. This person does not know anything about customer service and is more of a tyrant. Good luck with anyone with any type of complaints in this complex. She will smile at you while she throws lies and excuses. I would recommend speaking with an attorney before submitting anything to management<//text>

<Text>Upkeep is terrible.
1-Laundry mat near building 70 is always filthy. I have see dirty socks on the floor for weeks. It is obviously not the laundry you show to potential tenants. Lock on door has not worked for several years! On two occasions have had to kick out homeless in the mornings. Also occasionally scrape the sidewalk near entry where the tree drops all it's seeds. It looks filthy.
2-Street light (on property) next to building 78, turns off at night when you walk by it. It gets very dark when walking to cars or mailboxes. This has been in this condition since 2014. Maintenance says it belongs to city, and don't follow through/up.
3-Dog feces everywhere. Need I say more.
4-Trash receptacle area maintenance-terrible, trash always on floor, overfilled.
5-Office staff- In my time here and the four iterations of manager and staff, the only consistency has been the poor service. The only way to get your attention is by going in there and demanding service when all else has failed.
6-Tree fell on iron fence years ago, still has not been repaired.
7-Clearly maintenance is understaffed. It took you over a year to fix those broken lights on walkway to laundry.

General feedback: If you put as much attention on the property as you do remodeling your office space every year (or manager), this whole place would be a lot better. The maintenance staff is as helpful as possible (considering their limitations), and always will to help if you stop and ask them.

Office staff usually condescending, sales people, more interested in filling units then servicing existing tenants. The location here works perfect for me, that is why I stay. Tenants are friendly and respectful.
Questions? I would gladly discuss any item with you or walk the property and show you areas that have been neglected or require attention.<//Text>< Date>

I’ve been a single female living in this community over the last 14 years the first thing I worried about was me living by myself and feeling safe I have always felt safe living here I have always felt if something needed to be fixed I can call into the office and they will come and fix it I don’t have to worry about coming outside and people are hanging outside and I’m scared to walk past them the place is neat and always clean and even though it’s a little bit expensive sometimes you have to work more than one job to make sure that you’re safe</Text>

I have lived here for 3 months now... I want to start back from the process of applying to rent here. I worked with the manager Christy. She was very patient with me and helpful. I was going through a lot and needed to find a nice place for me and my family. She worked with me all the way through and after I was approved, locked in my place.

Later, I worked with the two assistants, one was named Alejandra. Both were very nice and helpful as well. So far I have enjoyed my stay. It is peaceful and quiet. Very family and dog-friendly.

The kids are able to swim and play outside. I love the forest look.

You must like dogs if you live here. Almost everyone has one. I love my apartment and the fact that they have several options.

I recommend this place.< /Review>

MILITARY DO NOT RENT!!! I provided my separation orders with 2 a month notice. Separation under honorable conditions falls under PCS and therefore under the Servicemember Relief Act lease termination would cost nothing for early termination. They have been sending debt collectors after me for unpaid rent since I didn't give them a 3 month notice for over a year now!<//text>

Roaches, spiders, termites, upstairs neighbor with 2 full size huskys that are constantly running all day and night...  My fridge died and was replaced by one that freezes everything.  I refuse to deal with the office staff ~ they are rude and condescending.  I was told that they are not allowed to do anything about the roaches because of city ordinance, as far as the noise, they said that that is normal because "people have to walk" and perhaps I should have picked an upstairs unit.  So, I guess it was my fault!!  I can't wait until I get out of these old, un-kept apartments.  Our most recent issue are fleas from the upstairs unit.  I am counting the days to get out of these apartments.</text>

<review>We have only been here a month but so far I can tell you this place is great. It's safe and quiet and for the price you get in comparison around here is awesome. It was important for us to have a balcony and a washer and dryer and most places you will have to pay 1600+ for a one bedroom with that description and be of decent size plus be pet friendly. Location is ideal for military as it is close to base and there are plenty of places to shop nearby. I hardly ever hear my neighbors through the walls and have had no problems at all with bugs, mold or birds as I have read in other comments. Parking can be a little tricky sometimes but we have always found a parking spot, however you can lease a garage if it's important to you. Amenities are great, the gym is kinda small but has all the basics you need. Lastly, the management and staff are super nice and very helpful.< /review>< Pics>

My husband and I have been here for 2 1/2 months and we are extremely dissatisfied. Anytime you have to call the front desk they are not helpful or welcoming at all. Louis at the front building is rude and zero help what so ever. We pay 95$ for carport and a storage... people constantly park in the spot and the front does nothing about it (no matter how many times you call). Our storage was broken into when the door was locked so high concerns about maintenance. Maintenance is also extremely rude as hell. Our window looks like people have tried to break in and they still haven’t fixed that... I could go on but just wanted to give a preview of the hell you will experience by living here. Yes we have called to complain and fix the pressing issues and nothing has been done.<//review>

<Text>I love the friendly staff, they are always willing to help you with whatever your concerns are and they always great you with a smile....

I like the cleanliness of the pools in and around the relaxation area. But i mostly I really enjoy the Gym its always nice quite and clean. I love the park like setting they've got so many paths to chose from when it cones to your morning walks or short jogs...Great for your pets too!!!

Also i love the fact that you can take shots walks to the store or restaurant and its perfectly located near the freeways and best of all the shopping mall...Also within walking distant should you choose to walk. As i have in the past...And of course there is the school also within walking distance.  Its quite and a great place to raise your kids.

Last but not least, when you have an issue with your in-house appliances or whatever the issue at hand maybe the staff is on it. Within
sometimes less the 24 hours in most cases after submitted your slip request. :)

I had no problems with the office staff when we lived here but there were huge spiders everywhere in our apartment. When I told them about it, the staff scheduled us for maintenance to come in and spray and they did come but the problem didn’t go away. If you don’t like spiders this definitely isn’t the place for you.</Text>

This is my third year living here and I couldn't be happier. The apartment is beautiful, the place is lovely and the staff is wonderful. I read many reviews and many people complaint about this place. For the experience that I have living here for three years, I can tell you that if somebody does not take care of the place, is not the Management, sometimes are the  tenants themselves. If something need to be fixed, the Maintenance team is wonderful and respond very quickly to fix the problem. If I have any questions, the Management responds in the same way, always with courtesy  and in a friendly manner. I'm very proud to said that my apartment looks beautiful inside and out because I care. I keep it in  perfect condition and also care about the surroundings. When I read other people complaints it make me thing that we do not live in the same complex. I Love living here!.< /Text>

< review>
This is the worst place I've ever lived. The maintenance men are amazing and get things fixed right away. However, the management isn't the greatest. They shut off our water to work on boilers without notice. This has happened three times. They towed my husbands jeep while he was underway (out to sea) without notice because they claimed it was "stored"... However, I was issued the ticket 15 minutes after I parked it. After getting military legal involved we were returned our money. There isn't installed air conditioning and you're not allowed window units so you have to get an indoor air conditioning unit and you'll expect you electricity bill to be over $300. The only bargain is the location.< /review>

< Review>
Parking is garbage, that free spot doesn't do much when there's only maybe 50 spots for over 100 residents. If I don't get home before 8pm I have to park a half mile away from my home. My neighbor has been targeting me and blowing cigarette and marijuana smoke into our apartment and we have a baby. We've made multiple complaints to the main office but they've done nothing and it's getting worse now. We pay roughly $1700 for a run down 655sq/ft apartment and that's too much for what we get. Don't move here because I'm counting down the days till we're gone.<//Review>

I have lived here a little over a year.
This is the 3ed place live at since I’ve moved to California and so far its the best.
I have a 1 bed/ 1 bath, for the the price I pay for the studio I lived at when I first got here.
The maintenance men get right on things when you need them.
The only thing they need to work on is there office workers; they are not of much help.
The manager on the other hand though, that lady knows what she’s doing.< /Text>

The maintenance staff is punctual and more than open to explaining any details about any inquiries. The neighbor hood seems pretty well kept. It's location is pretty convenient, and safety has never been a concern.

Short of a five star were the larger of two pools, which never seems like it has enough chlorine in it; the stoves are outdated (at least mine [ it works, but it's outdated-  doesn't really compare to the near-brand-new, if not brand-new dishwasher and microwave]); the porch has only minimal rain coverage (anything beyond 3 feet of the back door is liable to get soaked, depending on the rain/wind during), and some parts of the lawns just haven't seen a good landscaping in a while (areas with very little vegetation/grass coverage are watered excessively). Not HUGE issues to me, but still worth omitting that last star, and worth some attention.</text>< Pics>

They realuze choosing a place to reside is an important decision and they make the entire process as seamless as possible.

< Review>
The office crew is Fantastic and Amen to the New Manager.
Now if you would please bring the green grass back up front of the property.
The front of the complex looks so boring and is for sure not inviting for people to come and rent and be part of the family.
When I first rented at EGA, the green grass is what got my attention. All the weeds that I see when i am coming home - just is disappointing. I'm sorry - but it looks very un-inviting.  Its all about appearance -This is California - not Arizona... Hello....
Green Grass, Blue Ocean and Palm Trees is what It's about.
Just my thoughts -so please don't take it the wrong way.  This was done by the last management. New Management and crew ... pat yourself on the back..... the property looks beautiful... except for the entrance of the property.  I'm just saying..
Bring the Green Grass back...</Review>

<text>WOW! Liz, why did you remove my Review of Eucalyptus Groves, was it something I wrote in my Review or you just did not like reading the truth of why Eucalyptus Grove does not even rate 1 star?  Was it because of the Bacteria & Mold, Mildew that cause my Neighbor & son to end up in the E.R. because of their Bacteria & Mildew in that building & maybe all the other buildings there.  Or because you kept 1/2 of my Deposit & charged be approximately $350.00 for a rug shampooing & 4 drip pans.  That should not have been no more $85.00, yet the carpets were never shampooed & you moved some folks in, the same week I moved out?  Don't forget why I could not sleep in my bedroom for the first 9 months due to the Bird infestation's above my bedroom ceiling!<//text><Time>1446415293901< /Time></record></dataset><record>

<text>Renters beware, this Company will take advantage of you if given the opportunity.  My wife placed a deposit on a place at this location on a Thursday with 72 hours to cancel.  Before 72 hours was up she called on a Sunday with no answer, thinking it would be wise to talk to someone she waited till normal business hours on Monday at which point they said it was past 72 hours and they were going to charge her the full deposit.  There's a lot more story to tell but I'll save it for court.< /text>< Resp>

<Review>Looking forward to move OUT of this apartment complex, apartment is not worth what you pay everything is old, definitely will not recommend. When you tell them about it all they could do is trabsfer you to another “upgraded” apartment yet you have to pay more when you are already paying more than what the apartment is worth.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1532103430124, 'text': 'We’re sorry to hear of your recent disappointments.

<text>My wife and I rented an apartment here. Do not recommend we had multiple attempts at break.in one while we were asleep two homeless ppl broke in and robbed us. Another time they tried coming in thru the bedroom window and it took maintenance 3 weeks to come fix. I turned in a written notice we were vacating due to my going on deployment in 2 months turned in our keys and was told everything was ok.... lo and behold two months into my deployment they tried charging me 2 months rent after we had already turned in the keys and then served us an eviction? Would not recommend this property at all.. because of that I am having to take to court and having a hard time finding another place to rent from.</text><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1518810323718, 'text': 'We want to start out by apologizing for your experience at Eucalyptus Grove Apartments.

<Text>my worst renting experience, there's dog poop & pee all over the grass and walking paths, and in the dark you need a flash light otherwise you will step on any poop.
Everytime when rains the soil gets full of worms, maybe because excessive dog population in a very high density living area, those worms are human contagious too.
And in the middle of contract period they restrict parking polices, so they find ways to charge you more and force you to rent additional parking spaces.
In the pool they allow the dogs to play around, I complained but nobody did anything
When you end the contract, they will charge you remodelation cost too of the unit you are leaving so they want to rip u as much as possible.
The gym everything is broke
You can hear everything that happens in every unit apartment of your building (each building has 8 units), those are very very old obsolete design buildings, but they just want to keep milking them.
Rent some where else, or better buy your own place, there a lot of blood sucking people
I would sue them but I have no time</Text></record></dataset><record>

Poor experience! Was told the apartment was cleaned before move in date but it most definetley was not it was actually very gross to the point where I had to go out and RENT my own cleaning tools so whoever they hire to clean does a very poor job and they don't seem to check. The parking is terrible almost through out the whole day where you pretty much have no other option other than to buy a carport or garage so you don't have to park in a completely different parking lot than where you live. Things in the apartment seem to constantly have problems and it seems like maintence tries to avoid doing anything until they have to.. my washer had problems twice and the third time I had to call the guy showed up already knowing what parts were broke and exactly what he needed to do like he couldn't have done it before... Not to mention the cost of the apartment itself is pretty overpriced for what you get. Overall it has been less than enjoyable. Edit* With the summer heat hitting there is also no AC for some reason (especially in CA) so it gets very hot in the apartment. Along with the fact that we just recently discovered a termedous amount of ants flooding through our apartment.< /text>

<rate>1< /rate><review>Mosquitoes everywhere! When I report it, I was told to leave containers with sugar and water or wine to solve the problem. Had to cut my lease short. Parking is always an issue if you leave your apartment after 8pm.
My move out date was on a Sunday, which was scheduled by the staff in the office. On move out day I drove 1hr to drop off my keys and no staff was present. Then they tried to charge me 2 extra days worth of rent because they failed to show up on my move out day. As usual they act clueless to the situation. Manager was no help.< /review></record>

Nothing but a bunch of cheap thieves. My mom resided in these apartments for a year. They gave her an apartment with a broken microwave, a dirty shower, carpets stained from cigarette burns. I scrubbed the shower myself, the dirt was there for so long there's not enough bleach in the world that can clean it. The plumbing had never been upgraded like all of the others... All of this was noted before my mom moved in. Chula Vista gets pretty hot during the summer so it only makes sense that these apartments have NO AIR CONDITIONING! For 9 months my mom was forced to sleep on the couch in the family room because there were birds living in the roof of the apartment above her bedroom. They didn't want to fix the problem because they didn't have the correct truck. One of the neighbors had to loan the workers a truck so the problem could be resolved. One of the workers nailed the cutting board to the kitchen counter. After all of this they still want to keep 1/2 of mom's deposit. They say my mom left a clean apartment (And she must have because new tenants moved in as soon as she moved out) BUT they're charging her to clean the rugs and for 4 drip pans because they wanted to touch up the paint...For that they're keeping 1/2 of her deposit. That makes no sense. And now the new tenants are stuck with the same broken microwave and the same dirty carpets and the same disgusting shower.</text>

At the moment  you arrive in that place  the waiters give you an enjoyable feeling. Very courteous team, it is a happy place to hang out with friends and colleagues or with your date. Excellent  cooking, professional  chief cook and stuff, honest  price and excellent  service. Highly recommended.</text>

<text>Ordered a turkey and ham with no onion or wax peppers,  I received a turkey with no ham and wilted lettuce. Extremely disappointed. I also felt like she was rushing me to order and no one was in the store.< /text>< Gmap_id>

<review>Great food, great prices, amazing staff.  The girl at the register was helpful with the menu (my mom is on dialysis and can't eat certain things) and worked with me on substitutions.  The visibility if the business is not the best. The large tree in front of the building shields it from the street.  I didn't see it until I had passed it, then had to make a U-turn, but it was worth it bcz of the friendly staff.  I'd definitely go there again.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Came here on my lunch hour because it was the closest Deli D to me. The service was great and speedy. My order was correct but looking at the cheese and meat ratio was totally off. For all the meat and lettuce, I only had one paper thin scrap of cheese. I'll stick to the Manchester Mall location or remember to ask for extra cheese next time.<//text>

<Date>1559937309398< /Date><Text>SLOW...SLOW....SLOW
All hospital and downtown employees only have so much time for lunch. When you wait for a sandwich to go for almost 20 minutes and you still have to send it back because it was not made incorrectly.....it's very frustrating. Many of us stopped going because of the poor quality and speed about a year ago..... I should of stuck to my decision.</Text>< pics>

OK, I have only written a few reviews in my life... but this one should be written!  My wife and I lived in San Fran years ago, so we know the area pretty well.  We went up for the weekend and decided it would be "fun" to rent a scooter for at least a few hours.  We TRIED to sign up for the "Scoot" application and found out AFTER signing up, that you can't put two people on oen scooter!  So, we walked over to Mr. Scooter!

WHAT A GREAT GUY!  We talked with the owner about how we wanted to put TWO people on a scooter and we wanted to be able to drive over the Golden Gate bridge. He helped us pick a GREAT scooter (I personally didn't think it would be big enough for me and my wife... but HE WAS RIGHT / I WAS WRONG) and gave us a GREAT price (he gave us a discount for multiple days).

In short, we got a GREAT scooter, NICE HELMETS and a lock to safely lock it up at night.  The owner (I think his name is Pedro, but I like calling him "Mr. Scooter") was amazing.  Such great recommendations on where to go, what to see, etc.

We went EVERYWHERE.  Literally, we covered the ENTIRE CITY in two days.  We went to breakfast, lunch and dinner... we drove over the Golden Gate Bridge... met friends, took great photos, you name it.  The scooter preformed PERFECTLY.

When we returned it on Monday, I asked "Mr. Scooter" where to go for lunch and he recommended a place that was AMAZING as well.

Its great to rent from someone who knows their product, knows their customers and even knows a great place to eat!!!

Again, I don't write many reviews... but this scooter rental MADE OUR WEEKEND GREAT!< /text>

Friendly service, very accommodating.  We met the owner, a great hands-on guy who took pride in his business.

We rented a scooter for 10 days to ride around San Francisco and Sausilito.  We even took it to city hall for our marriage ceremony!

There is are many distinct neighborhoods in San Fran, and the scooter was the best way to explore.  The 150cc got us up plenty of hills with no problems.  We rode to the Cliff House, Along the Embarcadero, through Presidio, Little Italy, Chinatown, Haight Street, Golden Gate Park, crossed the Golden Gate Bridge, up to Muir Woods, the Headlands... everywhere.

Parking was easy and traffic was a breeze to get through too. We had a problem with a side mirror after a few days, we brought it in and he fixed it in 15 minutes.  If you want to see San Francisco, rent a scooter from Mr. Scooter.

(I was not given a discount for this review.)< /Text>

Had a 3 day reservation for a scooter . Had e-mail confirmation . The day of the pick up they said they had no scooters available . I said i had a reservation they were too bad no scooters are left . Very unprofessional , no customer service . Be careful if you are relying on this company  for a scooter . Your better off renting an electric scooter like LIME or BIRD much cheaper and more reliable</Text>

Smooth and easy scooter rental. For a day adventure adventure around the city, a gas scooter like one from Mr Scooter makes way more sense than renting an electric scooter from Scoot.  Drop off and pick up were a breeze. I will be renting from them again the next time I have a free day in the city!< /Text>

Was in San Francisco for 4 days and wanted to see it from the perspective of a scooter. Found Mr. Scooter on line and they set me up with a 200cc Vespa. Chris took care of the arrangements from before I landed until after I left. Pedro oriented me and gave me directions. The operation was well-run and the equipment worked flawlessly. Will definitely be a return customer. Recommend it highly.<//text>

<review>We did Mr Scooter and had a fantastic experience. The employees were amazing to work with and got us on a moped for a great price. Renting a moped and riding around SF was certainly a great way to see the city. Especially compared to bicycling, which takes much more time and much more energy. Definitely recommend Mr Scooter!<//review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Renting a scooter was one of the best ways to see the city...even Sausalito and Muir Woods. The guys at Mr. Scooter were great - made the process very easy and they have great quality scooters for rent. Great prices too. We got a Vespa for the day and loved every minute of it. I highly recommend you check them out!</text>

This is the best way to go site seeing in San Fransico. The whole staff was great. Even the owner took time out of his day to point out tourist spots. Pricing was great too! Only $149 for 24 hours. Highly recommend!!!<//review>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>My Honda 250 motorscooter was smashed by a driver that ran a stop sign, and I needed an insurance estimate.  For $100, Chris had the estimate completed within the week and sent it off to the Insurance co.  He also managed to find a mirror that fit my 30 yr old scooter — which was really awesome (he understands how attached I am to that scooter and he actually is helping to keep it working) Plus, when the scooter had a noise in it after Mr Scooter serviced it, Chris took the scooter back and solved the noise problem no charge — which means they stand by their work product.  And when I told Chris that I wouldn’t drive my new Vespa because it sat too high for me, he creatively offered to cut out the seat to allow my feet to touch the ground (stay tuned for how that works out....).  All in all, their prices are fair, and most of all — they have integrity for their work product.< /Text>< pictures>

They won’t waste your time with appointments and all the unnecessary paperwork. Bring your scooter, tell your problem and they’ll fix it as soon as it’s possible. Better prices compared to other places in SF.< /text>

<Text>The best. Pedro and his peeps jumped on my scooter as soon as I arrived to make sure I could get back over the GGB without hitting traffic. The fixed the back blinker, the seat cable (to pop open storage compartment, and even modified a brake pull they had in stock to replace my out-of-existence part. All this in under two hours and for a reasonable price.

By the way, I wonder if some of these reviews are for a different shop in S.F. that I also called. Unhelpful, rude and don't work on "those Chinese scooters."</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Gmap_id>0x808f7e21111c0001:0xa204b72e7712796f< /Gmap_id>< response>

< review>
I brought my scooter in for an annual checkup. They told me they needed to replace the starter. The next time I tried to turn my scooter on, it failed. I called and told them about it and they said they would take a look but it would cost $90 an hour of labor. I had no issues before taking my bike there and they wouldn't take responsibility and wanted to charge me more money. Absolutely not. I would not go there again.<//review>

After biking the city, we rented a 150cc scooter at Mr Scooter : really good place, very friendly, good service and scooter in perfect shape and powerful enough for two. Best way to discover San Francisco, Golden Gate Bridge and the bay area, fast and you actually enjoy climbing the hills!< /Review>

I've been using Mr. Scooter for over 10 years.  I've bought 2 scooters from him (one new, one used), and 2 mopeds.  There aren't many scooter repair shops in the city, so i'm glad he's nearby.  His prices are decent and he stands by his service, at least in my experience.

He's worked on my motorcycle too, but keep in mind that his expertise is scooters, so if your motorcycle has an unusal problem, or needs a specialized part, you might want to take it to a motorcycle shop.< /Text>

I brought in my scooter because the carb had failed.  They told me they could fix the carb, *or* they could put on a performance carb for an extra $60 and it would give my scooter an extra 10mph of top speed.  I was skeptical, but they pointed out that my scooter had been heavily modded (by the prev owner) in every way except the carb.

So I tried it out, and sure enough, the top speed hadn't changed *at all*, and on top of it the scooter idle was now unstable.

Three weeks later the new carb stopped working.  I brought it back and they refused to do anything about it.

I'll be reporting them to the BBB, as well as considering going to small claims.  These guys are scum.</review>

<Text>We up graded our panel, installed EV chargers and installed a dedicated generator, including permits and inspection; it was a big job.  Everyday, Joaquin, Chris, and the rest of the Divine staff showed up on time, ready to go. They were polite, professional, and very thorough. Not only did they do the physical install, they helped us maneuver through the technical parts, the apps and online connecting, which through no fault of their own, was tricky. Finally, they the cleaned up every day before they left, checked in with us to be sure we had no issues or questions, and finished the entire job in record time. We appreciate their dedication and hard work, and 100% recommend Divine Electric.<//Text><user>103272420414247791316< /user><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Nathan showed up on time, did a great job with Covid safety and provided a clear overview of the project before beginning. The quality of the finished work was excellent and he provided a lot of education on options and safety. My overall experience with Divine Electric was excellent from scheduling to completed work. My only constructive feedback was that the cost was more than expected, but I guess you get what you pay for. Thanks for a job well done!< /Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>We had Nathan from Divine Electric out to look at an outlet that we thought might be on the fritz and he was amazing! He was on time, super friendly and professional, and got right to work. It turned out that nothing was in fact wrong with the outlet, but he was so diligent in making sure that everything was okay--looking in the outlet and in the fuse box, and checking where the power comes in from the street... really looking super thoroughly to make sure we knew we were good to go. While he was here, he was able to check a few other idiosyncratic things about our home AND make recommendations on backup power supply options for PSPS season.
Nathan was an overall great guy and we were happy with the professionalism of Divine Electric in general--great office staff, COVID protocols, etc. Definitely recommend!</text>< Pics>

Great experience working with these guys. We’ve had several visits from them, both for assessing and for installation and each time we have been happy with their work. They are professional, considerate, and their work has always turned out great. Most recently we had a new electrical box put in and they were respectful of our property. We have more electrical work to be done and we’ll continue to use Divine.<//review>

Great communication - updates with when electrician would arrive.  Electrician was prompt - courteous and included me in how he was approaching the issue.
Was clear - concise and assured me that he would do everything to resolve the issue !  I found Jae to be honest in his offers of remedy - did not feel unsold .
I will call Devine again and will definitely request Jae return !< /text>

We are currently using Divine Electric for both electrical and plumbing jobs. This review is specifically for Nathan, our electrician extraordinaire. Nathan was on time and INCREDIBLY thoughtful & thorough, truly going above and beyond. We are first time homebuyers, and to have someone explain things and go through the steps with you is so appreciated and, quite frankly refreshing.

<text>We had Jai from Divine Electric out to look at our electrical system and to give us an estimate for upgrades and a Tesla charger. He was very friendly and explained everything in detail.
We decided to go ahead with installation of a wall charger. It was scheduled quickly and installed as planned. The technician was very patient and kind with all my questions.
I would highly recommend Divine for electrical needs!<//text>< pics>

<Text>Divine electric is always prompt to answer calls, they schedule for assessment and scope of work, they explain clearly what needs to be done and budget needed, then they schedule for the installation.
The whole team is very professional, kind and with great attitude towards service. It's a pleasure to have them over and repair or install electrical stuff. Thank you</Text>< Pics>

<Review>Nathan was fantastic to work with today! He was very professional, knowledgeable and thorough. Unfortunately, during his initial inspection Nathan identified several potentially dangerous issues with our new electrical panel and sub-panel (both were permitted and passed final inspections!) I very much appreciated him taking the time to explain the issues to me in language I could understand, enabling me to follow up with the company that did the initial installation to get these issues rectified.

Nathan was very careful and clean when working in our house - installing our new Ring doorbell required cutting into the drywall, he did a great job patching that up which will make the final spackle/prime/paint job much easier and quicker for my handyman next week.

I highly recommend Divine Electric!</Review>< Rating>

<Text>Jae from Divine Electric was great. Courteous, professional, and informative. Talked me through everything he was doing, what he was looking for, and what he was able to observe. The main issue ended up being something that PG&E needed to fix and that's what I really liked: he made it clear what he could offer in terms of improvements and upgrades and what each would resolve, but that the main fix was FG&E. That type of transparency is what will keep me coming back.<//Text>< pictures>

Sami was fantastic. We recently bought our house and he was wonderful talking us through some of the challenges we were facing as first time home owners. He walked through the house with us talking about the various fixes that needed to be done, the urgency associated with the fixes, and what we could handle ourselves. He got us a detailed quote within 30 minutes that outlined everything we talked about. Will definitely be calling them again for Electrical and Plumbing needs!<//Review>

Byran & Luis were respectful, thoughtful, thorough and on time! True professionals in terms of everyone I worked with at Divine. Rob came in and did an exhaustive analysis of what was mission critical vs. nice to have in regards to deferred work left over from the previous owner on our new home. They replaced an old high risk subpanel, replaced some ungrounded outlets, updated our main panel, put in a new grounding rod and surge protection and even gave our pup some pets along the way. Awesome work across the board and transparent/easy on price. Would definitely hire again!< /text>

Divine was all about customer service from my initial contact with Matt to schedule, who followed up when an earlier appointment became available. The service technician (Jay) who performed the diagnostic and same visit repair was exceptional. Very respectful of any social distancing concerns, arrived wearing a mask, etc. He was knowledgeable and very thorough, explaining everything related to all the estimates provided. It was a truly great experience, and he made some solid recommendations for future items to be addressed as well.

UPDATE: Once again Divine's customer service was exceptional. I needed a follow up visit quickly, and between Matt in scheduling and Jay who came to my house, my very inconvenient problem was resolved within a couple of hours of my call. Matt was able to get Jay to my house quickly, and Jay put in the diagnostic effort to identify the root cause, go out for the necessary part to repair, make the repair, and then explain everything in detail for me. All of this while being focused on overall safety, including Covid precautions.

My sincere recommendation.<//Review>

Divine Electric has the best customer service of any electrician we've used.  We recently had our service panel upgraded and then had them replace all the knob and tube in our house.  It was extensive electrical work and they were very thorough, courteous, and professional.  I highly recommend them.<//Review>

Devine electric helped us choose and install a generator- they were great! They showed up on time, did impeccable work, treated our house with care, cleaned up after they were finished- the lead electrician Paul was fantastic, as was everyone from Devine- Mikey the man that hooked up the natural gas went out of his way to make sure everything went smoothly and got us hooked up as quickly as possible. I can’t say enough good things about them, and Devine in general. I have used Devine for another project and received the same excellent service-I would recommend them for any electrical and plumbing work!< /review>

Divine Electric is my go to Marin electric company. Nathan has done multiple jobs at my house and is outstanding. Incredibly knowledgeable, personable, prompt, and great at explaining the ins and outs of what he’s doing, which I personally appreciate.< /review>

Bryan was prompt, very clear about what work was required, and went the extra mile as have all of the Divine Electric folks I've worked with. Big thanks Bryan for the great work today!

< review>
Divine is an outstanding electric company.  Their technicians are the best in the business.  I had a highly complex Tesla Charger Installation due to the charger needing to be installed in a shared garage about 100 feet from my unit.  Since this is a small and complex condo development with a private home it was hard to sort out the wiring. They did a fantastic job.   Rob engineered the project ahead of time and Jae led the install.  I found Divine on the Tesla website as a highly recommended electrician.  Their reviews are very high and very well deserved.

Jae also did a couple of smaller projects on the fly and quickly handled those with ease.  The projects included changing wall switch locations and figuring how to wire a fan in our upstairs bathroom.  Even the fan was complex and Jae was able to sort it out.

Very  professional folks who provide excellent service.  Highly recommended for all of your electrical needs.  Five Stars all the way!<//review>

<Name>Stephen Root<//Name><user_id>103808451598798915938<//user_id><text>Power went out at two outlets and to our refrigerator and stove around 9am.  We called Divine and Brian, the electrician, happened to be in the neighborhood and came by within 30 min.  He could not figure out the source problem so in addition to pulling the fridge and stove from the wall, he went into the crawl space in our ceiling. VERY determined.  Ultimately he found it was a wiring issue behind the stove and fixed it quickly.  He could not have been more friendly, he was incredibly professional and after using Divine for some BIG work last December and now for this one more minor issue, we will for sure use Divine again.< /text>< Pics>

Had a great experience with Divine Electric from the first call to schedule my appointment to the service my electrician provided on site. Total pros all around. Couldn’t be happier with their work, attention to detail with social distancing and protective gear, and straightforward pricing. I felt in the know and in control the entire time.</Review>

<Review>I was really impressed with Divine Electric. The lighting in our living room was very poor so I called Divine Electric. They found a reasonably priced, simple and attractive solution that did not require the amount of work I thought it would take. In addition, they were extremely prompt, professional, and courteous. They cleaned up after they left so my house was cleaner than when they began.

I will definitely call them again if we need any more electrical work done, and if we decide to get an alternative source of energy if future power shutoffs are more common.< /Review>< Name>

Too successful for their own good. Fancy iPad quote generation that isn't a great user experience because they rarely have the exact part in their inventory. More worrisome, technology ads cost to their operation and that comes back as higher than average bids.  Also, due to their success they can do things like charge $89 quote fee (refundable with work) and it's frequently weeks before they have an opening. Prefer the smaller guy if you have a choice.</text>

We could not have had a better experience. We called Divine for several electrical anomalies in our home. Nathan was great, as soon as he introduced himself we were happy to have him in our home. Nathan let us know what he was doing every step of the way, and brought a real positivity and humor to our whole situation. He was able to fix the immediate problem as well as craweled in our attic, garage and under the house to track down our mysterious subpanal. As he inspected all the old wiring he noticed that our breaker panal was completely mislabled from the previous owners and took the time to accurately label them. We felt completely at ease with the work he reccomended and scheduled him to come back the following week. Our house is electrically sound, and we look forward to future projects with Nathan.<//review>

<Review>We had such a positive experience with Divine. It started with Sam helping us figure out exactly what we needed and getting us a quote immediately. They were able to start work three weeks later and finished the job in the exact amount of time they estimated it would take. Brian, Isaac, Matthew and Luis did an amazing job.

<text>I have no hesitation in recommending Divine Electrical. Our team of Joaquin, Luis and Nathan were the best electricians we have ever worked with. Our experience with them from start to finish was 110% professional, courteous and knowledgable. Nathan met with us initially to review all our project requirements, provide a company overview and a proposal based upon our requirements. He was thorough in his inspection and very informative in his presentation. His follow up to all of our questions was prompt and hugely helpful. Joaquin and Luis completed all of the work in our house over two days. They are true experts in their profession. They were extremely polite, complete self starters who explained everything they were doing and go to it! They cleaned up as they went and left our home as they entered it - except with amazing new lighting! We changed the scope of our project 3 times on Divine and this was never an issue. Even when I added on one more project after they had begun! Thank you so much for your expertise and I look forward to using your services again.</text>< pics>

Divine Electric recently helped my mother with several issues from phone lines to electrical wiring. With all these various jobs, each one was taken care of with true professionalism. Brian, the lead electrician, was exceptional. His expertise towards what needed to be done was most impressive. Luis, the other electrician on the job, was punctual, knowledgeable and responsive. He knew exactly how to address each issue at hand with genuine care and consideration. And last but not least, Paul: phone genius extraordinaire. His attentiveness to detail, and all around understanding of the problem, was truly impressive. Divine Electric helped my mother when no other company could. If you need an electrical company, look no further than Divine Electric.< /review>

Divine Electric continues to be one of those few companies that provides impeccable service, and Matthew and Luis recently continued that tradition.  First, they do what they say they're going to do and when they say they're going to do it.  Each day they were here, I got a call telling me when to expect them, and they always showed when they stated.  They also gave us continual status updates and what to expect, as well as thoroughly reviewing the work they did.  Kudos to Matthew, Luis and Divine Electric for another job well done; we've utilized their services three times now and can't recommend them enough.</review>

Matthew and Issac came out this afternoon and were fantastic. I had 2 50 lb fixtures that needed to be hung but arrived without the correct fasteners. They figured out how to improvise the installation and quickly completed the job. They were both incredibly kind to my kids and were fun to have around.

Nathan smartly assessed my home's wiring issue and my options for remedying it. Bryan and a couple associates followed up to implement the work. They did great work, were more than kind, and cleaned up well enough after themselves. I appreciated how well and naturally they lived up to my high expectations. Thanks!</Review>

<Text>I had a great experience with Divine electric. Nathan did a thorough job of checking out the job site and providing alternative estimates depending on the amount of work we wanted to have done--from the minimum work we initially requested to complete right away--to the work we might want to have done in the near future. Our installers, Bryan, Felix and Bobby did a great job and completed the work efficiently and on schedule.< /Text>< Time>

Bryan did an excellent job today!  He was very professional, knowledgeable, competent  and had a great positive attitude. I would recommend Divine Electric and Bryan’ to anybody who is looking for any job that has to do with electricians! I gave him five stars, but he deserves six stars instead. Thank you, Divine Electric for your great job. I’m very happy!< /review>

Nathan Dupre did an outstanding job installing my Nest doorbell. The old wiring was 60 years old, so he had to do some upgrading. He was quick to figure it out, expert and skillful, getting it up and running in no time. He admitted he has a passion for electrical gadgets; I could hear him singing as he worked. Great job. Divine Electric is my choice for any future work.< /Review>

<text>A power surge 10 days ago fried a ceiling fan and lights circuit. Nathan from Devine arrived on time and did a thorough inspection of the home circuitry which was 50 years old. He made some recommendations to upgrade the panel box to make the home safer and gave us 8-10 options including replacing the ceiling fan. He was courteous, professional, efficient and even alerted us to a plumbing problem in our crawl space we were unaware of while he was investigating our electrical problem. Would definitely recommend Devine Electric to anyone.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

We hired Divine Electric to problem solve lights that weren't working. We previously had another company out that told us that we would have to open a wall to get the lights working--we didn't want to do that.  Nathan Dupre from Divine Electric came and delightfully he problem solved the issue and got the lights working without opening a wall.  We are so happy with Nathan and Divine Electric that we are going to have them do some more work for us. Thank you Nathan and thank you Divine Electric.<//review>

<Text>Exceptional team of dedicated professionals who clearly enjoy working for their company and have high respect for their owner and CEO.  They exceeded my expectations and did a great job with the installation of a new generator and with the changes in our electrical panels.  They were friendly and highly competent.  I truly have not trusted service providers as much as I have trusted Divine Electric and their team.  Other companies could learn a great lesson from this outstanding company.<//Text>< Name>

Nathan and Felix did a great job installing out Tesla EV charger today. They were on time, very respectable and extremely knowledgeable about everything they were doing. They even were able to answer a bunch of other general electrical questions that I had. The price was great and the quality of work was top notch. I cant recommend these guys enough.

< review>
Divine Electric impressed me from the start.  I'd seen their smart vans around town and needed an electrician to re-fit my smoke detectors, so I gave them a call.  Andrew and Josie were extremely helpful and friendly in fixing me up with a next-day appointment (I had expected to wait days or weeks).  Their technician, Paul, arrived on time and took great care to explain and cost the project (installation of 6 high-spec hard-wired smoke alarms plus a light fixture installation) and was able to complete the job on that visit.  The work was conducted with great care and efficiency and I'm delighted with the result.  This is a premium-quality company - very highly recommended and I will use them again as my 'go to' electrician.<//review>

<text>Divine was absolutely "divine". I called mid-day on a Thur and they tried to get a technician out that afternoon. Although they weren't able to, they sent some the very next morning and Paul was right on time. He even gave a courtesy call 15 min before arrival so we could prepare. When Paul was here, he was an absolute joy to work with. He was courteous, professional, thoughtful and thorough. He presented three options for us after a thorough diagnostic and didn't pressure me to go with any particular option. Talked through each so I could make the right choice for me. Thanks Paul and thanks Divine for a great experience.<//text><time>1558715893492< /time><user_id>112559952543173765903<//user_id><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Very impressed with our technician.  Nathan was on time and called prior to arrival.  He did a complete check on our electrical system and provided an estimate for the work I had requested service for along with other issues that he noticed in his inspection.  He also did a nice job explaining all the proposed work and why it would eventually need to be done.  My wife and I immediately felt we could trust him and even left the house to go run some errands.  His work was clean, he was tidy, and we are very satisfied with his excellent customer service.

The only cons I can mention are that of the person whom 1st answers the phone.  I'm not sure what he does there other than charge $89 to your credit card prior to someone else calling to make an appointment.  He was also not able to tell me any prices or details about services offered.</text>

Nathan from Devine Electric was pleasant,  competent and industrious. We expected him to simply evaluate our problems and give us an estimate.  He stayed and did all of the necessary work, plus making some improvements that made our home a bit safer.< /Text>

<Review>Appointment made a week in advance.  Service rep Nathan D was available and arrived early after they checked to see if it was alright.  He was really nice, smart, easy going and found out what I needed super fast and was on top of it. Fixed everything in record time and without hassle or mess.  Even looked at a couple of other things that I wanted mohave him check on.  All terrific, professional and competent.  Will absolutely consider Divine Electric for any of my electric issues going forward!<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

From the initial walk through with Sam to the installation with Brian, I couldn't have been happier with the service provided.

As far as the specific scope, I had two Nest outdoor cameras installed. The installation was seamless, no visible wires (this was tough considering the tight and congested attic space) and an overall incredibly clean look. Brian is a magician and somehow managed to make the impossible possible.

A+.< /Text></record>

Divine electric helped us navigate the process of increasing our electrical service to our home. Everyone was terrific throughout several month project, from Josie, Darin, and Sammy on the planning side, to Jason, Bobby, and Isaac on the execution side. We couldn’t be happier with the results. Thanks Divine, you’re our go-to for electrical needs.<//Review>

I recently bought a house that hasn’t been updated since the 70’s... Divine Electric came and did a wonderful job updating some much needed electrical issues that we had.

Bryan, Matthew, Jae and Darrin came in with a professional appearance and and incredibly capable skill set.

What once appeared to be a simple job spiraled out of control into a labor intensive expedition into my attic, crawl space, back yard and just about every closet in the house.  The team worked seamlessly together to address every issue in a timely manner.

I would recommend this company or any member of the crew that worked on my house to anyone.  Thanks guys.</Text>

Divine Electric is the best electric company in Marin. They do amazing things like totally wipe EVERYTHING down against COVID-19 (yes, they went around with a spray bottle and rags), including wearing shoe coverings, fresh gloves throughout the process and masks - that level of detail also speaks to the electric work they do. Everything I needed from outdoor lights, a circuit board surge protector, new recessed lights and more — my technician went through all the pros and cons, he problem solved and was able to run estimates however many ways I wanted. They have an extensive Ipad system where they can show you products(lights etc) ahead of time and tell you about the features and have already thought of contactless signatures for COVID-19 after you decided on the estimate. It was very fast and I felt very informed on what I was buying. Usually technicians want to get in and get out - these guys actually listen and assess what you are doing and what problem you are solving for. Clean, neat and creative. They left the house better than they found it. A few weeks later and I'm thankful for all the ideas they provided and the craftsmanship they put into the house. They figured out every aspect of customer service from the lady who runs the office to the polite and smart electricians they employ.< /Text>

Divine Electric by far has the best customer service we have yet to see from any company. Our first impression of excellence was with Linda over the phone, but later interactions with Josie and Andrew were the picture of phone etiquette and hospitality. Chris (the manager) and the entire crew which included Jae, Igor, Bobby and Brian were the picture of professionalism. Chris took the time to personally walk his crew through our projects and Jae (the site manager) was nothing short of amazing! He answered every question we had and made sure we knew how everything worked. They were punctual, respectful of our home, furnishings and animals. They didn't take personal phone calls, and their communication between the office, dispatch, crew, and management is nothing short of incredible. They are the cream of the crop and I highly recommend them for any electrical services that you need.< /review>

<text>Embarrassingly,  I called Divine Electric because I had never called an electrician before but I see their cycling jerseys everywhere. However, despite that less than professional selection process, I am so glad I called them! They sent me a great guy named Nathan who is an amazing human being in addition to being a great electrician.  He went above and beyond to help my family out and was always careful to explain everything he was doing or recommending.  He was also very patient with our questions.  I will gladly call them again when I have electrical needs!</text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<text>Nathan just left our house and did an absolutely fantastic job. Ended up being a bigger undertaking than I expected but he explained why, gave me several options (with detailed pricing) to accomplish the job and laid out what each option entailed. And when he needed a bit of help at the end of the work, his colleague Jae showed up in short order to help him out.

They didn’t leave until we were comfortable with the work that was done and felt good about everything...Divine came recommended to my wife and I and we would highly recommend them to others after our experience.< /text><rate>5<//rate>< Response>

<time>1566436776825</time><rating>5< /rating><review>Five stars is for perfection. This is what I received from Divine Electric. Customer service, politeness, professionalism, common sense, and respect. Starting with the communication at the office to Sam out for a quote. Sam walked me through the process and what I should expect to be done. I asked if I could assist in saving myself some money and Sam was very helpful. No hidden surprises or expenses. During our conversation he said, "I think we can do this today." I was a little surprised and pleased. Jae showed up and it was on, he assessed the situation and simply made it work. "simply," is a complete down play. Electricians are a breed apart. It is a tough and difficult job. The way they made me feel at ease and complete a very difficult task was impressive. I know this because I spent a few years working as an electrician apprentice back in the late eighties. Jae knew exactly what he was dealing with and made it look as easy as walking down the street. Bryan showed up to assist and worked on the other end. By the way, both respectful and polite, and made the entire job happen. I can't thank Devine Electric enough. It is refreshing to meet real people not looking to take advantage of us. As a side note... please request Jae for any of your electrical needs. I can't stress how impressed I was with him.<//review>< Pics>

I highly recommend this firm.  They do excellent work, and are very professional and courteous.  I was really pleased with the attention to detail they brought to my job.  I had a more complicated project in my home, and I was very happy that Jon who came over to scope and provide a quote was also the foreman for the entire job.  I got exactly what I wanted, and they made sure I was happy.  The rest of the crew of Ivan, Brian, and Jason who helped with the job were all great as well.  I could tell that these guys take pride in the work that they do, and the final results reflected that.  I would highly recommend them for any electrical work, big or small.</Review>

We’ve done a lot of work on our house with Divine Electric and have been very pleased. They have rewired outlets, switches and lights throughout our house. Wired and installed ceiling fans with great attention to detail. Replaced outdated lights to more efficient ones and corrected dangerous work done by lesser qualified electricians. They are responsive and set clear up front expectations. There are no surprises in the cost and we receive what we pay for. They are cost competitive and offer a high quality job. We will continue to use and recommend them going forward. We have had the pleasure of working with Nathan, Paul and Ivan regularly and other members of their team. Darin, the owner is also easily accessible. All have been great.</text>

This was my third time having Nathan to my home for various electric repairs and upgrades and each visit has been a pleasure! Not only is this technician super personable, but Nathan is incredibly knowledgeable in his career and then some! He happened upon a point of entry our (not so) friendly neighborhood rats made just their size for easy coming and going. Nathan goes above and beyond to leave his workspaces and surrounding areas cleaner than he found them. He even did a repair that would have generally required me to hire a handyperson. If I could give more than five stars, I most definitely would and though Divine has sent out other technicians for past jobs/properties, I must confess I have a favorite in Nathan! (Shhh... Don’t tell Paul. He’s also fantastic!)<//review>

Divine Electric made our day. Our electrical issue at home was quickly and accurately diagnosed, and immediate repairs made things right again. Nathan was on time, friendly, and knowledgeable. He made everything easy to understand, and followed up to be sure all was well at the end of the day! We couldn’t be happier.< /Text>

Divine Electric was awesome. Same day service. Very Knowledgeable. I got six quotes on how to tackle my project. its just like calling different companies to get different ideas on bids. Just the most professional company in the trade business that I know of and I'm in my 60s. if you don't know who to call and need an electrician just ask for Sam (One of the Managers) at divine electric. looking forward to have them work at my house.  can you say the same about your electrician?< /Review>

<Review>So far so good, they take their time, check-in, double check things.  I don’t mind leaving the house open to them as I’m in and out all day with school drop offs, pick-ups, and errands, I don’t feel like they are casing my house.  They want to just get in, do a good job, and get out... they’re almost done with my first list, my highest priorities that had to be done before Christmas, and I’m already working on my next list of work for after the holidays! I have never felt good about an electrician before because all prior tries ended with unfinished jobs and flakiness... not these guys! They make a list that you agree to, they  price you up front and can’t charge more if the job gets more complicated... so at first you are a little in sticker shock, and then after, you realize that at least 1 out of every 4 things turned out to be complicated, and took them more time and materials than they expected it be from first look. So all in all you are probably getting the same deal as elsewhere as far as price... the ride is just way different! Different good! Previously, I would find a place that gave me a great low quote and as they went it would get more and more expensive... and they would make a mess, fill, my waste bins with boxes and old parts and sometimes not finish the job all the way... Divine guys use those little footies EVERY time they step in my house... no matter how many times they went in and out the door! Bless their hearts! They knuckled down and got to work minutes after I signed my quote, they were nice with my dog and kids even though they got in the way sometimes... they took all the garbage that they created with light installations and old parts WITH THEM! I’m pleased... so far... straight PLEASED, and nearly impressed! Keep it up guys!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Nathan and Divine Electric came to the rescue after last week’s deluge. They went the extra mile and helped us out of a really bad situation. Very professional and extremely good at what they do. Just hired them for a big project because they developed trust and integrity!!</Review>

<text>Had a problem where the circuit breaker tripped and half the house's power was out. Call these guys and within the hour, I had someone out taking care of the problem. Everything, from the first phone call, to the follow up and the experience in the house with Nathan, was fantastic! He was extremely professional, friendly, and made the process seamless. I would definitely recommend Nathan, and Divine Electric for any electrical needs.</text>< gmapID>

<Review>Don't let the silly pictures fool you. Darin Divine is unethical, unorganized, and his work is sloppy. He has one good electrician working under him, and even that guy is pretty fresh by any standard. But at least he was sharp and had good work ethic. Anyway, Darin Divine constantly sent new electricians to my job (to pad their hours) until I told him to cut that out instead of keeping only a few there, and his electricians caused other damages. They also took way too long. His rates were insane, too – the highest in the county, and not for any good reason.</Review>< pics>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>10/3/18:  After having an EV charger installed by Divine, I recalled them for installation of a transfer switch. The live scheduler was courteous and efficient. Nathan Dupre arrived on time to evaluate the job. I could immediately tell that he knows his profession. He spent the time to explain what was needed and required. Unlike other jobs where I understand they present various options and bids, the only options for this job involved the length of an extended warranty. From other reviews I suspect Divine is not the cheapest, but I have learned the hard way that you get what you pay for. Nathan & Bob arrived on time and spent the entire day installing the transfer switch. Both kept the job moving forward and were extremely considerate and polite. The YouTube videos I had seen about installing such a switch did not come close to depicting the actual work involved. In fact Nathan stayed into the early evening to verify the circuits were correct and he will return when the generator can be tested. I never had the sense of any shortcuts. The equipment and the installation will probably outlast me! I rarely write reviews as most services are simply acceptable. Divine stands out and deserves 5 stars.
2/25/19: Most reviews are written soon after one's experience. Perhaps just as important is what happens down the line, i.e., backing up one's work, supporting one's products and consistency of personnel. Today I had a followup visit for the transfer switch which Divine Electric (Nathan) installed last October. I was remiss in not testing it immediately after installation, but a recent 30 hour power outage forced the opportunity to test the generator and transfer switch. All worked well, but I had some operational questions and some thoughts about fine tuning the system. Nathan came out today as planned and spent an hour answering questions and making a few modifications to improve the utility of the set-up. He knew the system because he installed it. "No charge. Consider it a follow-up visit!" That's divine!< /review>< Pictures>

Great service from Paul and his team.  We had a seemingly endless list of big and little projects which were all handled in two days.  Our 1950 house has entered the 21st century!  We especially appreciated Paul being able to give us a work description/invoice on his first visit, suggesting options we didn't know existed such as Pico wireless controls and the whole home surge protector, and working with us to find solutions we wanted. Paul braved a low roofed, grody attic to find a place to put the bath fan exhaust and explained how all the fixtures worked. Everything was left clean and ready for spackling/repainting.  We are very satisfied and would recommend Divine Electric to anyone.</Text>

I just had my first experience with Divine Electric Norcal and I could not be more impressed or satisfied with the outcome.

First off, I received a text from the dispatcher, informing me on my technicians timeline and ETA. This made it extremely easy for me to be able to plan when to leave work.

Nathan, my technician, arrived, introduced himself, gave me his card, and put on protective freeze over his work boots before entering (which I really appreciated because it’s raining and muddy). He came in, went down Divine to work plan, told meWhat to expect, and quickly got to assessing the situation. He immediately identified the issue, fixed it on – site, and put everything back together.

Not only do I have power back to both of my bathrooms but I have cable again and will be able to watch the Super Bowl this Sunday.

Thank you, Nathan, and Divine electric, for a job well Dash done and excellent customer service.

I highly recommend Divine Electric Norcal.<//Text>

<Text>So this review is going to be highly, highly biased because Lily is a family friend of ours but you cannot ever go wrong with her food, ever. We've been eating her cuisine for over 20 years and she never disappoints. In fact, my family has spent several Christmas eves being fed by Lily and her crew. And her crew are the sweetest and kindest folks ever! Very attentive and good spirited, they always make us laugh. Living in Nashville, I've been hard pressed to find anything remotely similar to Lily's where the food doesn't feel like a grease ball on the way down. Her food is of the highest quality and freshest ingredients. I wish I could name my favorite go to dish..it could be the Honey Walnut Prawns but literally everything is on point. Please, please see Lily for all of your Chinese food needs!!🥡🥡🥡</Text><Response>None< /Response>< Rate>

The worst Chinese food I’ve ever had. The walnut prawns were not breaded, deep fried, and crispy like they are at every other restaurant I’ve had them, and the dish was absolutely swimming in pineapple chunks - it was nauseatingly sweet - as if someone tossed shrimp into your fruit salad as a prank.The hot & sour soup was the color and consistency of chocolate pudding - like soy sauce pudding! That’s where I gave up.  It was Inedible!</text>

The staff is very sweet and everyone’s very nice at this restaurant, we’ve eaten here twice in the past two months and both times we’ve been either with an upset stomach all the next day with you don’t want to know what coming out and she puked three times the next morning the last time we ate there so we will not be ordering from here again.  The orange peel chicken looked and tasted like something that wasn’t orange peel chicken, I could keep going on but I’ll stop.  Like I say nice and extremely sweet people but food needs work guys.  Sorry for the bad report but hey the good side is you can always do better.  Hopefully this is taken as constructive criticism thanks 🍗< /Text>

Had the lunch special, which included the main entree plus soup, rice and egg roll. Generous portions. Efficient service and clean. Location is right off a busy street but the vegetation outside the windows hides the street and makes it seem much more cozy.<//Review>

<Review>Really don't understand the positive reviews. I got the "Seafood Combination" soup ($11.55) and the pork slices appetizer ($11.85).

The soup was basically a large portion of cornstarch and water, a bit of egg white, a couple of shrimp and what'l was possibly an octopus tentacle (or maybe a rubber band, I'm not sure!) It was completely bland, with the most flavor coming from a couple of asparagus stems that tasted fairly fresh. The description said it was supposed to have noodles but there were none in mine.

The pork slices were practically pork jerky, so dry they were hard and felt like bits of plastic. I bought them to feed a dog. He was hungry, so he ate a few but was not interested later, nor was I.< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>Had a decent lunch of chicken and vegetables with good taste.  What is served as fried rice had little flavor.
Also was served a cup of hot and sour soup that needed more pizzazz as it was lacking.  Service was just slow as others received their meals before me even when they came in 10 minutes after. This place I used to give 5 stars. Hmmm<//review>< rating>

We weren't planning on going here, but when someone suggested it, we got lucky. It was a pleasant surprise to find a fresh and delious chinese in an unassuming setting. I really like all the fresh vegetables on the menu, they were cooked to perfection for me. This is good food and the price was very reasonable, especially for the large portions that were served. We really liked: mu shu pork, sizzling rice soup was one of the best I have had, and the basil lamb were our highlights. Service was okay, no problems. Overall, we we're very happy with the food quailty and technique. We will return.</text>

Not only is it the freshest food around, but the wait staff is exceptional too! The best war wonton soup I’ve ever had! They don’t kill the veggies. The jasmine tea is complimentary and really nice. Huge prawns in our “prawns with lobster sauce“.< /Text>

We just moved here from Indiana and have never had REAL Chinese food before. We went crazy and ordered a bunch of stuff and it was all so good. And we got so much rice! Sweet and sour chicken was the best I've ever had. Ever. Free house soup during lunch and it was amazing. Boyfriend got orange chicken and it was so fresh and delicious. We tried spring rolls and you can just tell they're cooked fresh. I would highly recommend this place. And we got all of that and both of our orders of rice and the veggies that came with our meats for only $36! Including the free soups and spring rolls.</Review><UserId.>107058195296742466274< /UserId.>< Rating>

<Review>When lily kai opened it was by far the best Chinese food that petaluma had ever seen.
Since winning many awards the quality has fallen off dramatically. The sweet and sour pork used to be an amazing dish but now is inedible, nothing but fat and grizzle, over overly sweetened. The quality of all the meats have suffered. Portion size has also gotten much smaller that when they opened years ago. Take out boxes are 1/2 the size of the nice opening they used in the beginning.
I'm sure this is just to combat rising food costs and rent in this city but panda express has better food now. City chopsticks is always on point...</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<text>Best Chinese in town!  Especially if you're looking for a solid lunch deal.  The lunch special includes entree, rice/chow mein, and some soup and salad.  A personal fav is the General Tso's chicken.< /text>< Response>

My family and I’s favorite Chinese restaurant! This place is the best Chinese food in the area. The wonton soup is amazing and the princess prawns are delectable. The vegetables are extremely fresh and the workers have been very friendly every time I have gone. I would definitely recommend Lily Kai to anyone who wants some fragrant and flavorful Chinese food.</text>

This should be everyone's go-to Chinese... Best Chinese around with reasonable pricing, large portions and no wait time... Food quality is consistent and always delicious... Fried dishes are very crispy with a perfect ratio of meat and breading... Stir-fry is always flavorful with 50/50 meat to veggies... Fried rice is never dry with the addition of juicy meats... Only complaint would be that sometimes there isn't enough sauce with certain dishes</review>

a little surprise to us on the road: we wanted a dim-sum basket but not all the items inside.  they were flexible enough to replace the undesirable items with more yummy ones.  Unlike many Chinese restaurants, this one has excellent service, very friendly and careful in serving.  A small but descent place. Recommended.</review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><text>An amazing gem of a restaurant offering inside or outside seating (weather permitting) in a casual yet typical Chinese setting. With daily specials and standard fare as well as house specialties, I have come to expect an excellent meal here and I am never disappointed. The service is better than adequate even during their busiest times. The inside is updated, clean and the people are friendly. Parking can be an issue at peak meal times as it is located in a very small, busy shopping center. Don't let that stop you though, it's worth it!< /text></record></dataset><record>

Lily Kai's food is great.  They have a wide variety and generous portions. The service is prompt and in my experience always has been accurate. The atmosphere is spacious and is definitely a sit down restaurant.  The prices are a little but on the expensive side but definitely worth it.<//text>

Staff was friendly, a little overly friendly. The food was decent tho a bit pricey. My 2 year old was freaked out by the waiter, he kept touching her and insisting she needed a high chair, she doesn't. then he kept serving her directly hot items and I had to watch that she didn't get burned. three stars tho for the effort and the food quality. but I probably won't choose to go back.< /text>

this is the best Chinese restaurant in the Petaluma/Sonoma area.The prices are very reasonable and portions nice. The only thing holding this back from 5 is some of the dishes were a bit over salted and tasted similar.  We loved the salt and pepper shrimp</review>

I make trips to Petaluma just so I can eat there.  Everything on the menu is awesome.  The staff here is super nice and kind.  There is one lady on their staff who is very awkward.

<Time>1554720151217< /Time><rate>4< /rate><review>This is a go to that I keep coming back to, restaurant, delivery, both are awesome.  In fact, when my mom comes to visit, this is the one place she must eat before leaving! This place can get busy, so be sure to make a reservation thru google. My rotation always consists of the scallion pancake, the wonton in chili oil, dan dan noodles, dry pepper chicken (entree or the wings are both good) salt and pepper shrimp and the beef scallion style.  The menu is really plentiful because you can pick any of the entrees with whichever protein//tofu you prefer. The food definitely has a kick to it, but the menu is pretty clear on the level of spice. I've always had great service here.  It's bring it out as it's ready, so you can pace yourself.  It's definitely ideal to come with a small group so you can sample lots of options!<//review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<text>Lily Kai has the best Wonton Soup and Honey Walnut Prawns anywhere! The shrimp, chicken and barbecued price in the soup are tender and generously sized. The Prawns have the addition of pineapple and are sprinkled with sesame seed.< /text>< user_name>

Was in town for business and not feeling well.  The Sizzling Rice Soup was amazingly flavored and unique!  Added touch, Jasmine and Ginger tea instead of the standard tea serviced in most Chinese restaurants.  Great service too!< /text>

Great food.  Would of given it 5 stars but the atmosphere is not that great when it is busy.  If it's nice out, sit on the outside patio if it's busy inside, just a thought.</review>

Gave Lily Kai another chance, and for awhile it was working out. Had a good rapport with the owner, Lily, and everything was good. That was until last night. Called in my order for delivery, spoke to Lily, explained exactly what I wanted and when I got my food, Princess Prawns, the shrimp were like mini rocks. Ever taste food that was over cooked in microwave? Well that's what these shrimp taste like. I called up and complained and of course Lily wasn't there, so the person on the phone had to call her and find out exactly what it was that I wanted. He called me back and asked me if I could pick it up myself. Told him no, I couldn't. Asked him to send me another side dish since mine is now ice cold. He said he was going to charge me for that. After going back and forth, he said my side side dish would be free. 1 hr later I get my Princess Prawns and now they are soggy!
Bottom line........I paid $48 for the meal (this includes another dish for my grandson) and a $20 tip for the guy because I felt bad he had to deliver twice. So $68 for nothing but aggravation, and a bunch of terrible food. I would like my & money back, but I doubt that will happen. I get the "the third time is a charm"), but not this time. I've had enough of Lily Kai! My advice to Lily is........eat the Prawn shrimp and see for yourself how terrible this dish is before you charge the public good $ for that terrible food.< /Text>

<text>This place has decent food, but they treat the customer like dirt. We waited well over an hour and ahalf for food that we were told to pick up in a half hour. they couldn't give us any answer except "soon" when we asked when our food would be ready. They offered no coupons or free sides as compensation and they were still telling callers thirty minutes as a wait time, when we were surrounded by people who had been waiting over two hours and had been told their food would be ready in fifteen minutes. They need to lose me and some more customers so they get the point that the customers time is as important to the customer as the night s receipts are to the restaurant. I will not go back or recommend them until they start treating customers with a certain minimum courtesy. This is Petaluma, not Manhattan. I could have run errands or gone back home if I had had any idea how long it would take. I can only agree with the reviewer who said they do not do busy well. If they had bothered to tell us they were really busy and it could be a long wait, I wouldn't be half as upset. They asked us to pay the moment we got there to pick up the food. Do not do this. if the wait gets long, walk out. They need to learn that their popularity is dependent on the good will of the customer< /text>< pictures>

<Text>Lily Kai in Petaluma is one of those very unique experiences in life that is extremely difficult to over-hype or not enthuse effusively about... It's simple a great marriage of exquisite excellent culinary delights (and what an array to choose from?) and a warm and welcoming ambiance!
It's no wonder they've won best Chinese restaurant in Petaluma for 4 years running.. Give yourself a well deserved treat, GO THERE! But please go hungry, their portions are legendary and you will need a doggy bag. :D< /Text>< gmap_id>

Amazing, Amazing food.. i have been coming here for 7 years now and it never gets old. Everyone I introduce lily kai to falls in love. They have great fast customer service, always attentive with water refills, they box your plates for you. You have to try the pork pot stickers, the sea food combination soup, schezun chicken, if i spelled that correctly. The honey walnut prawns. Beef and broccoli. Chow mein..... and it goes on and on.

I love this place. No other Chinese  restaurant  like it!!< /Review>

<Review>A place for cheap average food devoid of flavor, with below average service in a hurried atmosphere. In other word, go there when you are too tired or lazy to cook, and with only one goal in mind-- to fill your tummy and get by for the day. As for me, my search for decent Chinese restaurants in Sonoma county will continue.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<review>(Translated by Google) If you go to this place, they make you wait, but if another group of their race arrives, prepare to keep waiting, the other group will pass first.
I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT!!!

A hidden gem. The food is so satisfyingly healthy feeling and the flavors and quality are beyond anything out there. Worth going out of your way for! The French dip is to die for.< /text>

<Review>This place here easily on my top deli ever list. I just cant say enough.
But what i will say is, thank you for doing what you guy's do.
The pastrami sandwich with the steak fries was probably the best lunch i have had in quite a while.
The picture with the sausage was made by me. That was the dark ale i believe. Just amazing.< /Review>< date>

The hot links are the best I have ever had! Picked up a pack on our way home from visiting the poppies earlier this year. Stopped back this week, after picking cherries and bought two packs! We also bought a pack of German wieners that were excellent. The pizza smelled really good, must try that next time. They also have a good selection of European dry goods. Staff are extremely nice, I highly recommend!<//Text>

Fun little locally owned place with great food and great prices! All the hot sandwiches are fantastic, the Hungarian fried bread is phenomenal, and the owner is a swell guy who knows his meats. I cannot recommend this place highly enough. He also is selling bulk goods like eggs and whatnot in this time of resource scarcity, so +1 for that as well!<//Review>

<Text>I often try French Dip sandwiches wherever I travel, and I’m not exaggerating when I say the one I ate here today is my favorite of all time! The other orders in our group were also excellent. Very friendly service. I recommend getting a little soup first (which can be served immediately) while you wait for the sandwiches to be made. That worked great for us. I’m looking forward to eating here again the next time I’m in the area!</Text>< Pics>

The quintessential LA park.  We go here every day since we live a few blocks away and have dogs.  The weather is usually great even when the rest of the city is getting fog and there's a lot of space for dogs to run around.  We've started to also jog around the park and notice the awesome skyline views of the city and just about every group of stereotypes the city has to offer.  On a warm weekend day it does get a little crowded, but that just adds to the energy you get from coming here.  We also see a lot of picnics, birthday parties, and group gatherings here too.< /text>

<review>Took my daughter for her 6th birthday and she had so much fun! Definitely a place to try out with your kids! I love the bracelet and having everything charged to my room so I won't have to carry wallet around. They had a birthday banner on the door for my daughter along with balloons. The water park was great, it has different options from the tiniest kiddos to the adults. Restaurants have great food, arcade games were fun my daughter got 600 tickets on her first try lol check out was at 11am but I got the late check out for 2pm I was too tired to pack that early lol.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

We were very excited to come down a see Lola, but unfortunately we didn't know Lola does private showing so we miss her.  On a good note we did get to see Sid and got a great picture of him!  We also say a baby porcupine being bottle feed (so cute) overall a short and fun experience, staff was very friendly and informative!</review>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>Incredible Park that has seen dramatic improvements over the past few years. To name a few: brand new Olympic sized swimming pool that is kept in excellent condition, 2 brand new full sized basketball courts with smooth paving, updated playground for children.

Other amenities include 2 full tennis courts, soccer fields, baseball diamonds, and a skate park. In my opinion no other neighborhood park in LA County comes close.  There is plenty of room for everyone and the grounds are kept up.

My only recommendation would be to install some water fountains that also include a dog fountain at the bottom since so many people walk their dogs there.

There is also the South side of the park that is below the 60 freeway that can be accessed via foot bridge. It includes a large pond that is stocked with fish to enjoy fishing and a small ampitheatre.

To the gentleman who posted a review regarding no shade on the playground, I disagree, the playground and park itself is surrounded with plenty of trees.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMMm6pysLwFkqa8ug0aNzJDLdym8jfL8o0d8qZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPDzVG2rpc9ELTwYvEaGLW6PZhosn09hvngGeK9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNSA-rDlYa5jtvRKZl6Z5NbFA-hucAc0-oq_Xlx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Response>

Historic Belvedere Park has been the meeting place for events,  parties,  sports,  leisure and so much more.
It's been amazing to be a part of this park's history and witness the changes it's gone through.</Review>

I went there about a year ago. Looks like I was on the set of "American Me". Did their Parks and Rec run out of paint? C'mon clean up the bathroom! Worse than Venice Beach. Very intimidating, I had a very hard time releasing my "little friends" into the designated pool area.</Text>

They pretend they're considerate and want the kids to have fun but with ale turn a six-year-old down because the adult supposedly doesn't have correct swimming attire when I purchase the outfit it said swimwear! Young and ignorant workers who only care about their ego and take pleasure in turning people away and upsetting children!</text>

Nice clean family friendly park. Next to the school. Grass is nice and clean well cut. The restroom are nasty dirty. That took my rating from 4 star to 3 start. Over all its a good park next to the freeway. East LA park.<//text>

Free Swimming! Lifeguards are strict but that means they are doing their job properly. Swimming in the deep requires a swimming test. Going from one end to the other and back, earning you an access wrist band.</review>

<text>The place is managed by an "idiocracy", which is of course, idiots running a bureaucracy. If you go there in the middle of the day to swim, it's free, but you cannot go in the deep end unless you take a swim test every single time. And you CANNOT wear flip flops walking out to the pool. BUT, if you wait a few hours and pay them $2 to swim in the evening, you MUST wear flip-flops and you can ONLY swim in the deep end, but no swim test required. The pool is really nice, but I won't be back. Their rules are just too idiotic and confusing.< /text>< Resp>

<text>The best free swim for public around the area. Clean water, lots of lifeguards (making sure unruly kids fallowing rules 👍), lap swim and kiddy pools, check-in bags, and clean shower area with soap dispensers. Did I mention it is free?

Not a bad park, aside from the fact that I was not looking at the ground and stepped on some dog poop on the floor. This was ON the sidewalk too, not on the grass. Other than that, there's a baseball diamond where there happened to be a game going on, tennis courts and a skate park (didn't go to that side). Ok place to pass some time on a nice day.<//review>

This review is only for the life guards that work at the Belvedere pool. This is my second year coming to enjoy the pool(s) during summer, and almost every time they are seen screaming at children with absent parents. Children that are old enough to go alone, and if they break minor rules they get kicked out of the pool and have to stand on the hot sun for 15 minutes. They are rude and dont have proper training to dicipline children that come to the pool. They should clearly state the rules to everyone before stepping in so they won't end up screaming at everyone because they are breaking rules that are unknown. Just because they are children, does not mean they are not entitled to be respected. They should have the level of professionalism at all times to everyone at the pool.</review>

This park is good has a pool has a playground for kids but if you want to go inside the pool you have to wait cuz they have a limit for people to go in and also they don't let your kids use safety arm wear. You can have picnics. There's people there that sells snacks and drinks and there's plenty of shades<//Review>

This is rating is just for the kids playground:  there's no shade for the kids playground meaning most of the surfaces absorb all the sunlight and are way too hot for young children to climb and slide down.  Then the steps to climb onto the structure are much too high off the ground for young children as well meaning they must use their bare hands and arms to get up onto the burning structures.

This is southern California which is summer sun for the majority of the year so this playground structure was not well thought through. :(< /Review>

<text>The young people at the front desk are kind of rude and not very experience with any kind of customer service or people training.
When you walk in to the building and the front window a girl ask me to lift my shirt so she can see if I was wearing a bathing suit I told her yes I do and she insisted and told me that she need it to see it, I was anoyed and so I show her a little piece of my bathing suit itbwas s one piece and then she insisted that I remove my top, I had to raise my voice 3 times so she could understand that this was a one piece bathing suit and I couldn't remove nothing.
then she ask my son to come closer so she can touch the fabric of his shorts when you can clearly see that it was swimming shorts then she ask us to hold so she can ask someone else if those shorts were okay.
Then we head to the restrooms to wash up and they were disgusting with toilet paper all over the floor so we didn't remove our sandals, then the same girl told us that we have to leave our sandals before entering, if they spect us to walk on that nasty floor they should at least clean it more often, outside the floor was really hot, we were all barefoot and I had to carry my daughter because she couldn't walk on the hot floor my sons had no choice than to run to the pool so they didn't burn their feet and one of the life guards told them not to run of course since they were wearing sandals they don't care about the children burning their feet.
But at least the pool was clean since they don't even alloy you to bring your own towel or even your purse, you have to leave it at the front desk then go and ask for it when you are ready to leave, and they are so lazy than if you left it on the right side window the person at the left would not get it for you you have to go around and ask for it on the right side because apparently a few steps extra for them is complicated.<//text><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

If you're bringing your kids to the playground, then get lots of sun screen as 99.9% of the playground is drench in UV light.The pool is clean but the life guards are yelling at kids for not following rules that they dont even mention at frist.The parking lot is so small that crashing is possible.< /review>

(Translated by Google) Hi / Hello, I'll give it five (5) stars because it's a nice park to hang out, bbq, chill, or relax. However, at night there's not enough lighting for the kids! Zero (0) stars for that issue, and also no restrooms in the late evening. Taco bell on Brooklyn & Atlantic are the closest restrooms. If ya'll got a case of the bubblies, your in danger 🤣 They have free swimming.
Five stars because the park is beautiful to spend the day and have fun. Roast a carnita or a little lady and the pool is free. But zero stars because at night there is not enough light for the hills and the baths will be sawn in the afternoon. Imagine. Well it ca. .

Cinco estrellas por que el parque esta bonito para pasar el dia y divertirse. Asar una carnita o una damita y la alberca es gratis. Pero cero estrellas por que en la noche no hay sufisiente luz para los morros y los baños lo sierran en la tarde. Imaginensen. Pues se ca. .<//Review>
