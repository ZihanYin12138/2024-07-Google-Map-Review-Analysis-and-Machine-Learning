Rip off, Total bait and switch. The online menu on Google maps is a huge lie.
Order it on Postmates because the same order was $10 cheaper on Postmates and they deliver it.
If you really want to make yourself happy you might as well just go somewhere else because this place is a rip off!
How is the bento box on Postmates only $10.25 but if you go to the restaurant it's $14.50? Rip off.
Soft shell crab roll on postmates is $6.25, but walk into the store and it's $8.95
The same occurred on EVERY item in my order.
(See both pics for confirmation)
Ichiban PB is the Worst sushi restaurant in San Diego.

<response>None<//response><Text>Food had extremely poor quality. Teriyaki chicken was boiled, cartilage and bone in meat. Crunch roll was advertised to have shrimp tempura inside but instead had fish of some sort. Called to inform the restaurant of the situation and manager stated he would call back. No return call from anyone!

I would steer clear of this restaurant. Horrible food and poor customer service. You will be disappointed!<//Text></record>

I Strickly come for the bargain priced(daily
Specials)Combination plates not the Sushi Rolls. Their Daily Specials are offered for both Lunch and Dinner which is rare because most Japanese places only offer Specials for Lunch. I usually get the #1 Special which is usually Teriyaki, Ginger, or Garlic Chicken and is served with Fried Gyoza(4 pcs.) White Rice, and Miso Soup along with Salad.>> and then add 2 egg rolls. It's very reasonably priced compared to most other Japanese places and the quality is good. If you want Nobu this isn't the place but if you want a tasty, casual, quick, inexpensive decent quality place Ichiban in PB is a great option.<//review>

The best low key hand roll place ever! The wait was about 20-30 minutes on Saturday afternoon but it is so worth it.  Staff is very welcoming and helpful. We got a 6-piece order each. Fish was fresh and delicious. Would definitely visit again!< /text>

<Text>I have been coming to Ichiban for at least 15 years, probably longer. I should have written this review a long time ago.

Basically, this place serves affordable, decent sushi. They have an affordable happy hour as well. You order first, and sometimes it can take a while to order when it is busy. But this means there is almost always seating once the order is done. You can also call in your order for takeout. The important thing, is you can get a sushi roll (look at the special menu) for the price of a good burrito. For their other hot food, eat it before it gets cold.
My personal favorite rolls are the Orange Blossom roll, and their Caterpillar roll.
The staff are also very friendly and helpful.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc01c01b003867:0x89d3af061f3f2bea< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>It is always very hard to judge Sushi because everybody's experience is a little bit different. This is little more than a upscale cafeteria where you order and then sit down. Decent food but I wouldn't say it's the best.  Very very nice staff and great prices. My three star rating is based on my preference for very high end sushi.<//review></record>

One of my favorite sushi places in San Diego. It is sometimes hard to find parking, as the location is a very popular spot in Pacific Beach, but it is definitely worth the extra few minutes of driving around to eat here. The staff is very nice. I would recommend the dragon roll and a miso soup.< /Text>

This is a real find if you love sushi and also sushi at a great price.  Special rolls are 10 pieces rather than the 6 or 8 typically found at sushi bars. And the pricing is well below what I generally pay at competitors- actually about half.  The staff is attentive and the sushi very tasty.  There is also another location in Claremont at the 805 and Claremont Mesa Blvd which I've eaten at as well.  Not fancy but you can get a great deal at either location.</text>

Lol this is the only place I've ever gotten a fish bone in my sushi. Today I asked them to make a custom roll for me over the phone and I asked them specifically what the price would be beforehand. They told me it was going to be $4.50 but when I got there, the bill reflected a much higher price than $4 and they didn't even tell me. They just assumed that I would not look at the bill and pay for it like an idiot. I asked them what the price was and they said it was $6.50. I asked them why they didn't tell me this before I paid for it and they gave me the run-around. If they had told me before I paid for it that it will be more money that would have been acceptable. Instead they chose to be deceptive and hope that I would fall for it. Terrible experience.<//Review>

Great little sushi spot in the heart of Garnet Ave. They have happy hours daily with cheap rolls and discounted booze. You pay before you eat and grab your own table. The food is delicious and well priced, staff is friendly and it's a comfy atmosphere.< /review>

Ichiban has been in Pacific Beach as long as I can remember. Always good service, fun relaxed atmosphere and good food. They have Bento Boxes, Sushi, noodle soup and Yakisoba. Food is moderately priced and a local Pacific Beach Favorite.<//review>

However, i recently ate there with a friend and it was hot inside with no AC, there were also flies flying everywhere in the whole restaurant. They were landing on our food, flying in the kitchen around all the tables. This made me question the sanitation in this sushi restaurant. I dont think ill be going back unfortunately.< /review></record>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Ichiban is our favorite spot for sushi in PB when we don't feel like breaking the bank.

With every roll being under $10, and nightly happy hour until 7 bringing even more discounts, you'll leave Ichiban with a full belly and a fuller wallet than most spots.

Our usual order is a caterpillar roll, a lion king roll, and a sunshine roll - offering a good mix of different fishes and flavors - always fresh and delicious.< /Review>< GmapID>

Ichiban is good, but it's not the best quality. They have awesome Happy Hour specials, and sake and beer are always cheap. They run good daily specials, too, with different rolls every week or so. The edamame is always delish and perfectly cooked. My friend Kim and I come here at least once a month and our bill is like $12--I love it! It's a fun place to go if you want cheap, quick sushi, but don't bring a first date here…ladies like quality!< /Text>

Great place to go during happy hour to get a lot of sushi for a good price. The fried calamari roll is my all time favorite.< /Review>

I see that a lot of people like this place. To each their own, I suppose.

The ordering system is not efficient and very inconvenient. They expect you to look at a posted menu and remember what you want when you get to the counter. For a guy like me, it's difficult to remember the 5 rolls I want. Especially when there's a line out the door behind you. Which leads me to the next issue, in that there are no descriptions of the rolls anywhere. So what's in a chefs roll? Or the Baja roll? So they told me to take a sushi check list to the table with me and my server would come get it. They never picked it up so  we took it up front ourselves. Well as I'm still making my selections, my girlfriend's chicken teriyaki arrived at the table. Needless to say that my girlfriend had to sit there and wait for me to finish eating. One of the worst things a restaurant can do is not time their food correctly (I'm a chef, I know). I eat a lot of sushi and as much as I hate to say it, it will not be here.

The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the cooks did good work. But they can't carry the restaurant with a terrible FOH operation.</text>

Been going there for many years. Hasn't killed me yet. Here's the thing about Ichiban PB: the food will never delight you, but never disappoint you. Sometimes the service is very good and personal, sometimes ambivalent at best. The food quality NEVER varies; it's like it's popped out of the sushi machine. The bronze-standard for San Diego sushi. (Can I get some extra wasabi, please?) Be sure to check the glass display case up front for the discounted specials. And if you're a newby: Order FIRST, then sit. Snagging a table before you order is a serious プロトコルのエラー! · Update Feb. '14: Nothing's changed, prices up slightly. • June '17: Prices up again...<//review>

<review>So, I said I'd give Ichiban one more chance and they failed me again.  Stay away from take out. I think the food they provide for take out customers is made a few hours prior. They also are very stingy with the portions and colorize the mushrooms and zuchini to make it look like you get more chicken.  When you order take out, they don't call u when its ready, so you have to guess and keep asking.  You get twice as much at Natural Chicken. Ill go there from now on.< /review></record>

Very helpful. Comparable prices to other quotes I received. I had a cracked phone screen and they quoted me, gave me the estimated time of 2 hrs, and it came with a 3 month warranty. I would suggest this place for phone repairs.</Review>

<Review>DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE. THEY SCAM YOU. They said they could replace my screen in 20-30 minutes. They come back 40 minutes later and say they broke my home button. They offered no compensation or help whatsoever. Now I have to come out of pocket at Apple more money to fix something that wasn’t broken!!! This is highway robbery and no one should EVER take their phone here. This management is greedy, unscrupulous and shady. Terrible.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>I walked in and was helped immediately, the whole process took about 10 minutes and is by far the most affordable option for an iPhone repair in the Bay Area! Amazing customer service and extremely quick and efficient. My phone is working perfectly and looks like I never shattered the screen. I'll be recommending this place to everyone.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Broke my screen a 2nd time. So I came back here. Amazing service again!
They gave me a FREE good quality phone case for being a return customer! So keep your receipts ;)
Totally would recommend!!! (And they have an adorable doggy as welcoming assistant!)<//Text>

These guys are super helpful and honest. They will try their best to fix your broken device and let you know if they can't fix it (so you won't waste your time and money). They want to make sure you are happy with their service. You can wait for the repair. It usually takes about 30 minutes. The price is reasonable. Parking is easy.< /review>

<Text>You can keep shopping around for deals or reviews but this man has perfect ratings (****) and it's for a reason. Don't look for shady fixers that'll only save you some money. The phone works perfect and the screen is like new. He even cleans the camera dust and other dirt it may have.

Free screen protector too! Would come again for cracked screen fixing  (but hopefully we won't need to)

Happy with the service. Thumps up!< /Text><pics>None</pics>< user_name>

This is definitely the best place to get your phone fixed. They are very knowledgeable and honest with fair prices. I needed to replace a battery on an old i-Phone 5 and they did it in 30 minutes. I will never go anywhere else...<//text>

In December, I went to Wireless2Wireless iPhone Screen Repair a 1/2 hour before they were closing.

Instead of them telling they were closing in 30 minutes.  They took the time and fixed my battery port even though it went passed their closing time.

The employees were very helpful and should be commended on truly caring about their customers....

Sam has done it again.  In less than 45 minutes, my daughter's iPhone 6 has a new Apple OEM screen.  Yes, a second time and hopefully this will be the last time she drops it onto an edge till her next iPhone.  THANKS Sam!< /text>

I came to this store to repair my cracked screen for my iPhone 7 Plus. The repair took an hour and cost $85. It was the cheapest price in the area and they were speedy and pleasant to deal with. Definitely recommend it.</review>

<review>Do not be sketched out by the location/front appearance! I called ahead about replacing my iPhone 7 phone screen and was told no need to make an app’t just stop by. The staff was very nice, explained everything, and gave me a wait time of only 20 mins! If you don’t want to wait inside, there is a coffee shop right across the street and a decent sushi place on the corner of Santa Monica and Brockton. Free 2 hr parking on the side streets. Highly recommend!</review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Had my iPhone 6s screen repaired at another place and to my disappointment, found that the screen they used was either cheap/defective. Came back to that same place to report issues I was having and I was lead to believe that a different part from my phone had to get repaired. Thankfully I held off on paying to get said part repaired. I stumbled on Wireless2Wireless Mobile Repair and met Mike who was super helpful and informative. Got my phone fixed in no time and I couldn't be happier to have a fully functioning phone again! Thanks Mike!</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<username>Ashanti< /username><review>Was super excited to buy an unlocked 8+ only to get SCAMMED!!! the phone doesn't video call, doesn't have 4Glte compacity, and when i switch the phone to 3G I CAN'T even send a text message!!!  Was driving downtown and all my calls kept dropping. Smh. I reached out to them and they said it had something to do with my carrier. But I've been with metro for years and even t mobile couldn't help. when I reached out to wireless to wireless on offer up, which is where I seen the phone for sell,  the person had an attitude.

<text>I live in Santa Monica in the West Los Angeles area and I am so glad I found this gem of a place. I broke my iPhone 6s including the glass and LCD, and RJ not only fixed my phone in about 20 minutes, but he was super friendly, patient, and answered all my questions. Definitely one of the best experiences I've had, and great customer service. Fast and cheap! I highly recommend them.< /text><user>105796696175224332735</user><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

The guys I spoke to wouldn't give me the price of the membership over the phone, kept going around the question saying that I have to try to class and come to the location. I said I have a budget and need to know the price before committing my time. He said he can't help me with that, which is a shame. I think transparency is  important.< /Text>

There needs to be a locker, sauna and more showers. A cold bath would be a good addition, free gear once in a while and buddy system programs. The heart monitor per visit is $10 and to purchase one is $100. Monthly programs range from $100-160 usually.< /text>

Absolutely the BEST workout for my wife and I.  I have never had a one hour workout that has motivated us more and the kicked our butts like this!  The Staff and the Coaches are awesome and right there if you have any questions.  Customer Service is over the TOP!!  The vibe is better than any club you will have tired.  Give them a chance to prove it...you be happy you did.<//Text>

<Review>What a great team! OT HB is wonderful! I have been to other locations and they are great but no other OT compares to OT Huntington Beach! I have been going ever since it opened last spring, and it has been one of the best decisions  I have made towards meeting my fitness goals! Greeted with a smile with the beautiful ladies in the front to the trainers who truly care and know everyone individually is awesome! Corey Jasmine and Amanda are just so awesome! I usually attend their classes and all of them have an awesome and unique energy they bring to their class!<//Review><response>None<//response>< Rating>

I travel to Orange County every few months and frequently take class at OrangeTheory Fitness-Huntington Beach. It’s my home OTF away from home! Megan and all the other front desk staff are always so welcoming. The coaches are great, especially Jasmine. She is the best, always upbeat and energetic, and motivates you to go that extra mile.< /text>

Orangetheory is the best workout option for anyone! Every day is a challenge, but the instructors are kind and helpful creating a comfortable workout experience. The monthly unlimited membership is a pricier option than a regular gym which tends to scare some people away. However, in the grand scheme of things, you truly get a bang for your buck. The price it would cost to have unlimited workouts with a personal trainer would cost a great deal more and you are getting the same style workout with your orangetheory membership. If you want a gym with classes that challenge you, go by quickly (fastest hour ever), and provide you with fast results, this is your gym!!</Text>

Action packed, challenging workouts that change every day - and always goes by quickly with all the intervals and rotating blocks. Love the style of workout and forces you to push yourself and strive to beat personal bests/goals. I love how heart rate is a big part of the workout too and I can easily monitor my HR goals with the colored zones and splat points — really easy way to break it down and look at it! Love orange theory classes and definitely addicted!<//Review>

The workouts are timed (60 min) so you're not wasting time and you can easily incorporate into your day. Highly recommend Coach Cory, he motivates like a BOSS!...and plays the best music.< /Text></record>

I love the comradery, and team atmosphere. Also, the 3 different sections of the class make it go by so fast. I have done sports my entire life, and Orangetheory is the best full body workout I have ever done.< /review>

Everything! I like the split between cardio and lifting. I love all the coaches and even though there are about 20-30 people in the class they are able to walk around and make sure that we're doing the workouts correctly and adjust form as needed. Also everyone at the front desk is amazing and helpful!<//Review>

<Review>I love that it's always different, and even though I've been a member for over a year it's still challenging every time. I also love that even though the workout is done in a group setting, it's designed so that anyone can do it at their own level and not feel left out or intimidated<//Review>< Pics>

Coaches Cory, Romeo, Jasmine, & Chris rock it. The staff is great. The workouts are challenging (more like ass-kicking most of the time). Each coach challenges the class as a team but also learns your fitness levels and challenges you personally... you can't hide... if you show up, you better be ready to work!!! I travel quite a bit and have visited several OTF studios. I love our HB studio as it is newer and larger than most I have been too. The concept is great also because you don't have to think about your workout, similar to showing up for practice and simply doing what coach tells you to do. I'm into my membership about 11mo now, and, combined with nutrition, it has been life changing. I'm back to my old self again!< /Review>

Zara was very nice, but I’m out $424.72.

I bought a refurbished iPhone that wasn’t working properly. They said Apple would repair it for free. Apple said it was refurbished with aftermarket parts and they won’t cover it. Boost won’t take the phone back. I was a Boost customer for seven years because it saved me money. Now it’s costing me and I have to choose a new carrier.< /Text>

The manager is really nice and welcoming and so is the cool cashier. He gave me good advice and has excellent communication skills that attract the average apathetic customer. I'm definitely going to keep my phone service with them.<//Review>

Zara was very helpful in helping me choose the right phone for my 17 year old daughter. She is knowledgeable  about her phones. She gave great customer service. I would recommend seeing her when u want a phone.< /Review>

Zara is very patient and really helped me. I was on a old 35$ plan and only getting 1 GB data and no other store told me to change my plan and she actually changed my plan for me and now I get more data for the same price! She also helped me upgrade my phone and gave me a discount on the phone case! Very good customer service. Definitely recommend this store.<//Review>

<text>Staff was very nice. Did not get the sales associate name.

However I just received an e-mail confirmation of a review I did not write praising this location that was published on the date I went in.

Sooo there's is also a good chance when the sales associate was transferring all my data on to my new phone they also went and left a positive review for themselves...

So you know :/ breach of security and all< /text>< pictures>

<Review>When I went into Boost Mobile,My family and I were greeted very nicely by a women named Zara. She was very helpful, polite and kind to us. She made sure we left with no questions. This was a very wonderful experience at a phone store unlike others that were very rude. Thank you so much Zara for everything you did for my family and I!!💖💖</Review>< Pics>

My daughter and I got excellent service at the boost mobile store at 5309 Elkhorn Blvd from Zara. She has very good customer service skills and was more helpful than anyone else was at any other boost mobile stores that I have been to in the time I have had service with them.</review>

As far as stars and the LG tribute are concerned we are in the negatives..
However, Aliza was able to turn my frown upside down with her flawless customer service and cheery disposition. She is a keeper and I am now happy with boost again.. The end<//Text>

< Review>
The female employee refused to sell me a sim card, told me to go to the apple store theyll give me one...i have a note 8. They said they dk why she would say that. Soo I had to order one online and by time I got it the deal I was wanting was already over. She also lied about the deals they had and when I showed her them on the website and that that location was one of the participating ones (after she said her location doesnt have that deal),then was when she said she couldn't sell me a sim card. It was ridiculous .< /Review>

I got FOUR NEW TIRES 225/60/17 for $400 TOTAL out the door. Plus they have A HUGE supply of second hand tires which is what I normally buy from. I go exclusively to Ramos Tires. Gonzalo and his team are very quick and professional and polite.<//Review>

Second time coming here for tire patching. Both times, the job was done fast and professionally. They offered either patching from outside or inside. From inside is much safer and recommended, but costs more ($20). They just need to be a little friendlier (1 star deducted).</review>

The guy who does the alignment is great.

He does a fantastic job! $60 for cars and $70 for SUVs.

You can get an alignment for $55 somewhere else but I've always had a good experience here</text>

Ramos A&G Tire and Alignment in Garden Grove, CA. It was a really pleasant and accommodating experience. These gentlemen are kind, efficient and organized. I couldn't believe how quickly they finished all four tires with balancing. (Maybe 10 mins).
Thank you so much. Kimberly<//Text>

I have a nice set of aftermarket wheels, and after telling them to be careful with mounting the tires, they scratched all four wheels they happen to have scratched them all including the center caps when removing them to balance. They are supposed to have plastic or rubber covers for there pry bar and machines so that they don't scrach the wheels but they didn't so all of my new wheels are damaged and they refused to take the blame.  Forgot to mention that they also dropped one of my wheels which caused some damage to that rim. Don't go here to change your tires if you care about your wheels!< /review>

Always straight to the point, and always fair with their prices. Anytime I need a tire patched or get a used or new tire it's the first place I would go.< /text>

(Translated by Google) Excellent service and good price, I recommend them, I went to the Toyota agency and they gave me a budget and they recommended me with Ramos tires and I got half the price of what they told me at the agency, that's why I recommend them, and they are professionals.

Well if you're looking for a fine dining experience, if you're looking for any dining experience, you might want to look somewhere else, but if you're looking for the absolute BEST all around simple takeout sandwich, Lanza Brothers is it! I like to call it my all time favorite Number 1, because that's all you need to know, just say that you want the number 1 and your set. Not that all the other sandwiches aren't delicious, because they're all amazing, it's just that the number 1 is Italian sub simple perfection and with almost 100 years of sandwich experience Lanza Brothers will have you driving all the way across LA just for a take out sandwich!<//Text>

The best sandwiches period.  I love their bread and the seasoning.  The people at the counter are also very friendly.  I love to go there for lunch.  I highly recommend this place.  Try any sandwiches from there and you will love it.< /text>

What makes a great sandwich? excellent bread. The rolls Lanza Bros use are one of the best. Call your order in and it will be ready in 20 minutes, beats the lunch rush.< /Review>

<Name>A Binder<//Name><Text>Nice local Deli in Lincoln heights area. Friendly staff, and you can tell they've been serving the community for some time now.

I tried the PMT sandwich with everything and for the price I was quite satisfied. Meat and cheese was good with fresh tomato and  lettuce. Bread could be better imo.

Overall 5/5 great lunch spot if you're looking for a quick meal<//Text><gmap_id>0x80c2c6645cab9f07:0xcdacd9ecc6aec888<//gmap_id>< UserId.>

Very good sandwich. Ordered take out. Got a roast beef, and a turkey sandwich.  Turkey (pictured) is cut a little thicker than the roast beef, which was deli thin and absolutely delicious. The roll is firm, soft, and has good flavor.  It does not turn into mush even an hour later.  Their lettuce is shredded, has mayo, onion, tomato, and I felt it was a very solid sandwich.</text>

CHICKEN SALAD WITH BALSAMIC!!! Best in LA. Get it as a sandwich or as a salad. Make sure you ask for balsamic. This is one of those local gems that you won't know about unless you live or work in the area. Feels a little sketchy the first time (inside a convenience store) but definitely top quality ingredients and quality. You will not be disappointed.< /review>

< review>
Very good sandwich. Ordered take out. Got a roast beef, and a turkey sandwich.  Turkey (pictured) is cut a little thicker than the roast beef, which was deli thin and absolutely delicious. The roll is firm, soft, and has good flavor.  It does not turn into mush even an hour later.  Their lettuce is shredded, has mayo, onion, tomato, and I felt it was a very solid sandwich.<//review>

Was in the area and looking for something really quick to grab before heading back on the freeway. Grabbed an Italian sandwich and a beverage which was tasty! Super friendly staff too!<//review>

The various government services are well-represented here with two sheriff's deputies picking up a box of two dozen sandwiches, an LAFD ladder crew, and many other government workers. The line is much more reasonable than at Eastside market, but then again the food isn't quite as good either. In trying to figure out what was missing given that the meat was so good, it appears that the bread is just okay. But the sandwiches are really well priced and I enjoyed it.< /review><userid>115662050985113785786</userid><Time>1581577287975< /Time>< name>

<text>Went here a few years ago, when I had some business at the "San Antonio Winery".... "Lanza Bros. Market  & Delicatessen" is the real article,serving a large variety of great sandwiches,wines, cold beer  and deli specialties...They have chairs and tables out front, so you  can watch the cars go by,while eating your sandwich.... or take your order to go....This place has an urban "old school" L.A./NY vibe to the place...with the deli case and all...it seems like it's been there for years,and it has... Est.1927....not just your run -of- the- mill variety store,even though they carry everything your typical variety store would carry...not fancy,but down to earth...This is where the locals "do lunch"....I had the chicken salad, the tuna salad, or the roast beef,I can't  remember which...All I remember is, it was delicious...When visiting Downtown L.A., stop by Lanza Bros.Market & Deli...Enjoy!
FYI:
☆They don't accept credit cards,but F.Y.C., they do have an ATM in the store...

☆They don't sell fresh bulk produce,accept the veggies served  in the salads and sandwiches....They serve hot soups, featuring homemade Minestrone soup...They serve a Green Salad, with your choice of meats served on it, or topped with chicken salad or tuna salad.... "cold cuts"(deli meats) and cheeses sold and cut to order, priced by the pound~<//text><date>1483893049041<//date><pics>None<//pics><UserId.>105285796148081525717< /UserId.><Rate>4</Rate></record>

Tasty sandwiches at an affordable price. Sitting next to Main Street is kinda loud, but if you are into big trucks, you will enjoy the show.</Review>

<userid>110268127139555780924<//userid><Text>Great company! Got me a very aggressive deal on my Auto Insurance. As a young driver Auto Insurance is very expensive and with Monge Insurance I saved a lot of money couldn’t have been more happy. The agent made it extremely easy on me and I did not have to go into the office. It was as easy as one phone call. I would highly recommend this place to others, very fast and affordable prices.<//Text>< pics>

Extremely professional!
Family friendly and easy going, was in and out of there with the best possible deal within minuets with no hassle. Didn't feel taken advantage of. The manager Marlene was super nice and understanding, she took very good care of me. Highly recommend Monge insurance to everyone!<//Text>

Monge insurance is honestly the best. The three ladies (Genesis, Lic and Marlin) are really friendly. They understood my situation and gave me a good price on my insurance. I highly suggest getting insurance here ! :D< /Text>

Absolutely love this place. After shopping around for what seemed like forever, Marlin not only gave me the best price but also was not hesitant about showing me what her competition could offer. That was about 3 years ago and now she couldn't get rid of me if she wanted to.</Text>

I've been going to monge insurance for years.  I have nothing but good things to say about this business.  They go out of their way to make sure your happy and everything is done right.  I love the staff they are very pleasant and helpful and this is one of the few businesses left that the owner makes herself so available to her clients.  Overall this is a great place and I have no problem intrusting my buisness with them.</Text>

I will be coming to this office forever. The girls here are so sweet and Marlin went out of her way to assist me in understanding the process and never charged me the other fees the other places charged me previously.< /review>

<review>Pepe provided us top notch service and answered every one of our questions happily and without hesitation. We were headed to Tempe AZ and got a flat. Our roadside assistance person suggested this place and lead us here. Pepe helped us on many replacement choices and of course all the questions I had that followed. We were 3rd in line with no appointment, naturally, and the whole ordeal probably took around an hour.  This Discount Tire was very professional and you can tell they take great pride in their work! We hope never to be back given the circumstances, but rest assured that we're covered at any Discount Tire for the life of the tires. Not bad considering they were used tires.</review>< Resp>

I went in today 2-15-21  and spend $2,500+ on new wheels and tires I ordered last week. I was happy with my new purchase and left very upset after I seen they damaged my wheels and pointed it out to the workers and then manager came and all he said was "the center caps will cover it". I'm a regular customer and spend lots of money at these stores and you would think they would make it right BUT NO!! They knew I left upset and unhappy. How I wish I would of taken my business else where.< /Text>

Pepe was amazing today! I came in with a nail in tire that couldn't be repaired and he was really great. Very friendly and upbeat. He didn't think they had my tire but he found a solution. Thanks Pepe- Nicole from Salton City/Thermal</Text>

This particular location of discount tire by the IV Mall is our favorite.  Everyone we've dealt with there have been extremely pleasant and helpful. Tires available for all budgets and the seating for waiting is comfortable. The bathrooms are clean and and the establishment is well maintained.  All the employees at THIS location are nice, helpful and very eager to answer any questions.<//Review>

If you can visit the store in front of Costco than your better off doing that because their service here is not very good. 3/5 because they try find a way to do right by their mistakes but I don't understand how it happens so often* missing appointments and claiming they can't fix my tire while the other location in el centro fixed it within an hour.

Update: Things have changed and now this is the go to spot and the one in front of Costco needs help!<//Review>

I've been getting tires here for years. This location is great. The staff is very friendly. The place is clean. They are very helpful, but not pushy. Free water bottles is nice, especially in the summer. There can be a wait at times, so make an appointment. But give them the time they need, remember, they are changing your tires not making you fast food.< /text>

<review>Been getting tires with the company at this location since they opened. Jose (Pepe) and the Team are always professional and always get me what I need in a timely manner. I’ve seen people come unglued at the prices and come back while I’m still there and apologise and purchase their tire here cause Discount Tires prices were still lower then Costco and Wal-Mart, with warranty. Kudos to you guys keep up the good work.< /review><username>Joshua Hawk<//username>< GmapID>

I had a 20 minute wait to pick up a
MOUNTED Tire. I had earlier paid and had paperwork finished on. Just a pick up.
The tire prices are good/ fair, this was a warranty job, but Waiting this long for an associate to roll the tire to edge of shop? A bit excessive<//text>

Place was a little busy but they were nice, attentive and very professional. The shop was clean inside and out  plenty of comfy seats in waiting area. Went to get a new tire and rim , they checked my tires really honest and said I didn't need to purchase if I didn't have to, but one time I was stranded in the middle of desert on freeway with a shredded tire and no help for hours so I didn't want to take a chance. The price for a tire and rim for my vehicle was less than 140. Great prices alot of people in az and cali said thay was good deal. Now when I visit this is where I'm coming to buy tires for me and my family.</review>

Jimmy at the El Centro location was amazing. We were already on a spare on the back right tire, and the front right tire was on its way out as well. We prayed all the way to the store as we googled the closest tire shop on our way back from a family vacation. A car of 6, four of us being kids ages ranging from 6-13. We all looked homeless as we had been at the beach all day, and as you can imagine this was the last thing my husband and I needed. Jimmy was quick & offient. We were lucky that we even made it as far as we did, as the spare popped as he pulled our SUV in to be repaired my husband and him heard a huge pop. The spare exploded.  Jimmy had us  quickly taken care of and  on the road again, on our way back home to good old Tucson. Thanks Jimmy, thanks AMERICAS TIRES!!!!</Review>

This store has always been attentive and have always listened carefully to my issues. Above all they solved the problems in a timely manner and gave me their opinions just in case I wanted to take another route. They even price-matched my dad's tires for 1000 that were originally 1700.</text>

Service was slow, I had to leave the cars for two hours each for tires mounting. However the cars were ready at the time they said. They matched the price from other stores which is good since they provide tire rotation spinning and balance for life, but BECAREFUL, VERY CAREFUL!!!  They tend to misread your car's odometer and since your tires warranties are base on your car mileage, it is to your advantage to make sure the odometer reading is correct. They did it to my two vehicles.</Text>

<review>Was sold 4 new tires, installed on 4 useless rims. Manager did not bother to inform me of useless corroded rims until after purchase and when i returned the next day with 3 flat tires with the 4th slowly losing air. I had to use brother-in-laws vehicle to take rims and tires back to this shop and no refund, no apology,  nor an offer to help repair rims slightly was given. Will not be returning here and i would look out. This place showed me that they care more about sales than the safety and satisfaction of the customer.< /review>< Pictures>

I love Dr. Agrawal! Her passion for dentistry lights up the whole room. She is compassionate and caring, remembers absolutely everything about my dental history.
She has a great sense of humor and she is fun to joke around with. Getting my checkup often feels like catching up, which we never have much time for.
She is professional and gives great advice, improving my own dental habits over several conversations. I can imagine that side is great with kids and even has a little corkboard of "zero cavities club."
I recommend Dr. Agrawal to everyone I know!<//review>

< Review>
My family has been coming to Future Dental Care for over 12 years, and they have always been fantastic.
Now I have brought my husband over in the past year and we have loved  getting to know Dr. Agrawal and Laura.
They had great communication around their closure and reopening plan around COVID-19 regulations. Luckily we didn't need them, but they were open for emergencies during the shelter in place. Once they were cleared to open for routine care, we came in for some cleanings.

They are so quick, and we got our cleanings done and out the door. They checked our temperature, required masks upon arrival, they were wearing masks the entire time,  had a hand washing station ready, and friendly sign to welcome us in!

I had an old mouth guard that was overdue to be replaced, and my husband needed to come back in to get his wisdom teeth removed, and Dr. Agrawal got my mouth guard ordered and shipped in time for me to pick up by my husband's appointment the next week to save us a need to come back another time. Also, from the moment we stepped in to when we left for my husband's wisdom tooth extraction was less than 45 minutes - wow. And then Dr. Agrawal checked in on him around 8pm that night to make sure everything was okay and offered tips.

Thank you so much Dr. Agrawal and Laura for keeping us safe and taking care of our teeth!

Hi, I am a 34 and this has been the best Dentist I have been to in my life!!
I go regularly thank you very much. =)

THEY HAVE NETFLIX FOR YOU while you are getting worked on WHAT!!! This alone is 5-star worthy.

Dr. Mudita Agrawal was nothing short of amazing - she was extremely gentle/careful, had great table(chair?) side manner, and was very directive - as in if i needed to open wider, bite, move my tongue etc.

She let me know what was going on with my teeth, what options I had when she found cavities, and how to proceed with the work/repair. She worked with my Insurance and billed me appropriately for what was done, and had several follow up with me to make sure my teeth and I were feeling great.

The Facilities were very nice - it was very clean and looked brand new. Dr Agrawal also worked with my busy work schedule, often having appointments with me going past her regular office hours - which I appreciate greatly.

I would definitely recommend her to any and all who need dental work done! 10/10

Best,
Gene</text>

<Text>I was not really looking for a new dentist because I’ve been going to mine for quite some time however this pandemic has rendered me a bit less flush with cash than I normally was due to my business closing so when I received a flyer in the mail offering a full exam, x-rays, and teeth cleaning I decided to try it.
I must say I am over the moon thrilled with this wonderful dentist and her practice. The name is Future ..... and now I know why. Her equipment is almost futuristic. I’ve never seen Equipment of this caliber including an MRI machine which is state of the art. I am overwhelmed with happiness that I have now booked my night bite guard Appliance with her plus my next cleaning four months later. Personally I prefer to have my teeth cleaned every four months due to a buildup of calculus.  My other dentist has a hygienist to clean teeth and this Dennis charges me $125 just for the teeth cleaning. I was amazed at how this dentist cleaned my teeth herself. No hygienist and no extra charges. She also took actual camera photos of my teeth with a small electronic pen as well as the usual x-rays. She took the time to go over each tooth. Some show hairline fractures which could not be seen with an x-ray but the photos  are most impressive. When I walked in the front door there was a small sign that said Welcome Tricia. A very nice touch.
Another wonderful feature is that she has Saturday appointments and evening appointments. Plus she is available 24 hours a day seven days a week for emergencies. Who does that anymore? This dentist is amazing. My teeth were sparkling clean after a thorough “scrubbing”. 😀 Too bad I couldn’t post photos!</Text>< Pics>

This was the most pleasant dentist experience I have ever had. Both Dr. Mudita Agrawal and Laura Alvarez (the patient coordinator) are kind and friendly people. Laura worked hard to fit me in on short notice before I left on a trip. Dr. Agrawal was great about showing me around and explaining every step of the process, even walking me through the x-rays and photos she took of my teeth. She took care of a cavity in what have must have been just five or ten minutes. The pricing was also very reasonable, which is important to me since I don't have dental insurance. I couldn't recommend them more!< /Review>

<GmapID>0x808fa347c2266ccd:0xb19fd4cafc5e1f54</GmapID><Text>Visiting dr. Agarwal was a wonderful experience. She was punctual, very friendly, and was charming person to talk to. She is very knowledgeable about her field and gave me good tips on how to improve my brushing and flossing techniques. Aside from her dental expertise, she is a very kind and energetic person who wears her heart on her sleeve and is willing to get to know you as a person as well. We could talk about our lives freely from anything to our interests to what is going on in our personal lives. And she lets you watch tv during the dental cleaning if you want to. Anyways, I look forward to seeing her shin for my next cleaning and I recommend her if you are looking for a new dentist.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Dr. Agrawal and Ms. Alvarez run a wonderful dentistry! From the start, Ms. Alvarez personalized a welcome sign for me and my husband on the start of our appointments. The facilities are clean and welcoming. You could tell that they spent time making sure that the office was COVID-safe. During my routine cleaning, Dr. Agrawal was quick and efficient. She took pictures of my teeth so that I could be better educated on my dental care. Overall, it was the most pleasant dental experience I've ever had.<//Review>

This was the best dental experience in my life. The dentist is very positive, caring, pays attention to detail, and easy to communicate with. She explained to me what procedures my insurance covers and what procedures it doesn't, which is very helpful information to know. Another nice nuiance about this clinic is that at the front, there was a little sign with my name on it when I came in.</Text>

I’ve been to many dentist offices, non of them have been as welcoming, friendly and professional as future dental office, Dr mudita, is a great dentist, she listens and makes sure her patients are fully taken care of.
Overall, after a couple of visits, I could have not been happier with choosing future dental office.</review>

I rarely leave reviews for places but I definitely had to for Future Dental Care. This was one of the best experiences I've had at a dentist. Dr. Agrawal is so warm and kind, and she made me feel very relaxed during my routine cleaning appointment. She was great at communicating what needed to be done and was extremely transparent about my options and pricing for future services. I found the pricing to also be very affordable and made me realize that I was being significantly overcharged by my previous dentist. I would highly recommend Future Dental Care to anyone in the area!<//Text>

I had a great experience at Future Dental Care. Dr. Agrawal was very patient and explained everything that's happening with my teeth and gums and also educated me on the future steps. She's very accommodating with her time and I am very thankful to her for seeing me last minute. Highly recommend !< /Text>

Dr. Agrawal is nice and professional! She removed calculus between my teeth that was not properly cleaned by my previous dentist. She also fixed two cavities on my teeth. She explains what she will be doing and takes pictures of the tooth so I can see clearly how my tooth is fixed. She always makes sure I'm comfortable. I can choose to watch TV or listen to music.
For COVID restrictions, I got my temperature tested upon visit, and was asked to wash my hands right after. This place makes me feel safe and comfortable. I definitely recommend!<//review>

My experience at Future Dental was fantastic! The facility itself is very nice with ample parking. Dr. Agrawal was excellent. She walked through the x-rays and images she took of my teeth, provided useful dental hygiene tips, and made the entire experience smooth and efficient. I will definitely be recommending Future Dental to my friends and colleagues.</Text>

<Text>Dr. Agrawal is the best! I have severe anxiety around going to the dentist and she has been so patient and kind. I moved to the area last year and had a dental emergency. She got me in right away and helped me to resolve the issue. When the oral surgeon that she referred me to had a long wait, she called around and found another who could see me quickly. (Dr. Howard Low = fantastic).  I've since been back for cleanings and have taken my kids in for cleanings as well. Can't recommend her enough!<//Text>< name>

Both my husband and I needed our teeth cleaning and we had great first visit experience with Dr. Agrawal. She was professional, communicative, and nice. All the processes since booking our appointments went smoothly. I liked how Dr. Agrawal took the time to explain about my teeth conditions and each step she was performing. Location is great too, with easy parking. Already got my next appointment booked. Highly recommend!</review>

It was an awesome experience. Dr. Agrawal and I had a lot of conversation about my teeth, and she used images to explain the state of my teeth. I left feeling well informed. The cleaning experience was also good. Highly recommended.< /Text>

I had my first visit with Dr. Agarwal this week, and it was great! I have been seeking for a dentist who could inform me about my dental needs with transparency and honesty and Dr. Agarwal gave me just that. She is gentle and gets the job done. I really appreciate her patience, vibrant personality, and making me feel SO comfortable and taken care of. I feel that I can really trust her and her office! I'm looking foward for my next appointment next week :).

!!!! Update: 02/25/21 !!!!

Dr. Agarwal never seems to disappoint me. I had a great time as usual. I am always feeling welcomed, comfortable, & safe with Dr. Agarwal and her staff. Today was my third appointment, booked for my last session for deep cleaning. It was smooth and painless, as usual! I encourage you to come to Dr. Agarwal's office. You'll be in good hands. 🙂 She is genuinely caring for her clients and wants the best for them!<//review>

My husband and I had our first appointment at Future Dental Care yesterday. If you are looking for a new dentist, I highly recommend coming here. We were greeted warmly by the front desk person, DJ, when we came in. They had safety precautions put in place for COVID, and we both felt safe and at ease. Dr. Agrawal is kind and caring. She made the effort to make sure we were comfortable during our visit, and she took some time to get to know each of us and our dental history. Prior to coming in, making our appointment was easy. I called on the phone, and Dr. Agrawal helped to set up appointments for each of us. She worked with our schedules and even called us to set up earlier appointment times when there was a cancellation. Customer service is excellent! We are so happy to have found a new dentist!<//review>

Excellent care, conversation, and comfortable accommodations.

They go above and beyond to make you feel welcomed and comfortable, and, as an added perk, you get your choice of music or netflix entertainment!<//Review>

<Text>Dr. Agrawal and her team provided the best dental experience I have ever had. From the moment you step in, everything feels welcoming, down to the little details like a sign with your name on it!

Dr. Agrawal takes the time to explain and answer any questions you may have throughout the appointment, and honestly the time flies by given the TVs in each room playing your choice of Spotify or Netflix.

Highly recommend!<//Text>< Pics>

This was the best cleaning I've ever had! It was completely painless - which is a first for me because I have high sensitivity. I highly recommend Dr. Mudita Agrawal, she was very professional, knowledgeable, and offered helpful tips for teeth and gums care.< /review>

It is rare to find a medical professional who takes the time to establish a real relationship with each of her patients and connect with them beyond the exceptional care she takes with her dentistry.

She and the Future Dental care team did an excellent job of ensuring proper COVID-19 safety protocols were in place and made me feel incredibly comfortable during my visit.

I will be going back for all future dental care needs, and would highly encourage anyone looking for a new dentist to reach out!<//Text>< Pictures>

I don’t like going to the dentist so I’ll start there. Dr. Agrawal is really great though. From the questions on her new patient forms asking about previous dentist experiences to her safety COVID measures. I appreciate also that Dr. Agrawal is very transparent about cost and walks you through all your options and talks you through your xrays and images. I really appreciated that. As long as my insurance covers my trips to Dr. Agrawal, I will be coming back.</review>

Dr. Agarwal is awesome! I've had a lot of work done with her -- multiple crowns, fillings, and deep cleanings, and Dr. Agarwal handled them all smoothly, while being extremely flexible scheduling. She's very careful to make sure you feel no pain, and doesn't do anything that's unnecessary -- she's referred me to specialists when it was the better option even at her own loss. There are large TV screens with Netflix to pass the time during the work. I've had many dentists in my life and I wouldn't trade Dr. Agarwal for any of them. Highly recommended!<//Text>

I’ve been a client/customer/patient here for 7 years, ever since I moved to Ca. Like most people I hated the dentist, but they’ve changed my mind. A combination of friendly people, great service, paired with educating me on the process and choices available to me, have empowered me to feel in control. I now look forward to my appointments, especially when it’s just a cleaning. Just had one today!< /review>

<text>Mudita is excellent at her job. She is patient and calm and addresses all of your questions. Her clinic is more customer focused than few of other places I have been. For advanced prodcedures also Mudita lays out all options with transparency so that you can make informed decision. I would definitely recommend her to any of your family needs. Her facility is very clean and she has entertainment options for you while you get your teeth done like inbuilt music and tv. This can come in handy if you have to get long procedures done.< /text>< Pics>

I’ve been going here for years and I recently switched my kids (4 & 6 years old) over as well. Both Dr. Shariati and Dr. Agrawal are fantastic - and this is coming from someone who has had a lot of dental work and generally doesn’t like dentists. It’s rare to find a dentist that does everything themselves from the exam and cleaning to complicated work, but both these docs do. They will always spend as much time as needed to answer questions too.  I would highly recommend Future Dental Care!</Review>

Dr. Agrawal responded swiftly to my email when I contacted her about a problem I was having, and I could tell by her writing alone that she was a kind person. I had a great experience with her. Future Dental Care’s facilities were clean and very high tech, and Dr. Agrawal was casually conversational yet professional while she worked. There was a TV screen overhead that she had connected to Netflix, and we watched The Great British Baking show throughout the process. I’d love to go there again for regular check-ups. Future Dental accepts PPO insurance, but she saw me uninsured. It cost some money, but such a good experience after years of dental anxiety made the cost feel worth it (I paid about $400 total for a check-up, cleaning, and cavity filling). Additionally, she was conscious of the risks posed by COVID-19, so the check-in and out procedure felt appropriately distanced (and I was the only other person there when I went on a Friday evening). I definitely recommend Dr. Agrawal!</Review>

<Text>My dentist experience was great with  Ms Agrawal.  She efficiently did my xrays and cleaning.  She also made fine suggestions on further procedures to better protect my teeth and I really liked that she was not pushy just concerned. I would Absolutely recommend her.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I was very happy with my experience at Future Dental Care. I got my teeth and gums cleaned along with a couple of fillings. Dr. Mudita Agrawal did a fantastic job. All the staff at the clinic were very friendly. I would highly recommend this place.</Text>

<Review>There were tears, plenty of tears! Yes that is correct, tears from laughter and fun! Now you wonder if I am leaving feedback at the right page, yes I do! Dr. Agrawal is such a wonderful lady and be assured, she is a well of knowledge and skill! You'll learn that she is not after your $$ but caring about you and your family!
I am so grateful that my search lead me to her and that she had her doors open during covid-19.
Everything was well prepared for my visit, including an adorable little welcome sign on the counter with my name on it!< /Review><pics>None</pics>< GmapID>

Have been going here for over a year and really appreciate the team. I prefer early appointments so I can go before work and they are always accommodating of my schedule. The team is always incredibly friendly and they actually care about me and my life. I love how they play music of your choice and make an extra effort to make you comfortable.<//Review>

<text>I highly recommend Future Dental Care for your next appointment. I have been a patient of Dr. Shariati for years. His patience, kindness and attention to detail is unsurpassed. I recently had an appointment with Dr. Agrawal and I couldn’t be happier with the results. Their facility is spotless, their equipment is state of the art, and their work is superb. I’d give them a sixth star if I could.< /text>< Pictures>

< review>
They were extremely thorough. They took quick digital x-rays and pictures of each tooth. Then went over them one-by-one. Everything inside seemed clean and tidy (very important to me with a dentist). They let you pick whatever music you'd like to listen to while they work, which is a nice touch. Dr. Agrawal gave me a very thorough cleaning and I'm completely satisfied. I will definitely be returning.<//review>

Had my first visit here today. The office was super tidy and all the staff was knowledgeable and professional. I was nervous as I had not been able to go to the dentist for a couple of years, as soon as I got in the chair I felt comfortable as I knew I would be in a good hands. My doctor took the time to explain to me my current dental issue and had a clear treatment plan set up for me. I’m so thankful to have found this office and will recommend to my friends.</Text>

Dr. Agrawal is an amazing and hardworking dentist. She's not only highly skilled at what she does but she will go out of her way to make sure you are cared for. I have challenging teeth and gums and she was able to give me a lot of preventative care options, that have saved me a lot of $$. She's one of those dentist you can trust and who is truly passionate about her work.<//text>

I've been going here for at least 8 years and love Shervin and Mudita. The recent visit was during COVID-19 pandemic and all precautions were taken. I also love that Shervin does Saturday appointments which is great for working people, especially since I am coming from ~45 min drive away. The tech is very recent, the office is spacious, and they are super responsive to email. Recommend!< /Review>

< Review>
Very attentive and courteous. I went in for a routine cleanup earlier this year (before covid) and she checked my mouth, gums teeth etc for any abnormalities and all was good. She did notice that I had some similarities to those that suffer from sleep apnea. So I followed up with my primary care doctor and she requested a sleep study and sure enough, I had sleep apnea. So in a way Dr. Agrawal saved my life! And I went back in today for my second cleaning and I thanked her immensely for giving me a heads up about improving my health.< /Review>

Dr. Mudita has a refreshingly positive attitude as soon as you walk in. She’s very good about acknowledging customers, making sure they know what’s going to happen next, and making sure you are comfortable with everything. She even put less numbing agent because I told her I had a call within a couple hours but it wasn’t too little that it didn’t do the job. I have been impressed with the two fillings I’ve gotten from her. I would certainly trust her with more work in the future...lol<//review>

The moment Dr. Mudita sees you, you will find that she genuinely takes care of her patient. She is knowledgeable and explains the dental procedure before starting. The front desk staff are warm and friendly. I would definitely recommend friends to come for dental needs at this facility.<//review>

Dr. Mudita Agrawal was the best dentist I have ever had. I can’t believe I was laughing during the whole appointment. Price is very fair. She literally has the best bedside manner out of any medical/ dental professional I have met. I can’t believe I left smiling after an extraction!! Painless and patient.< /Text>

I’m very satisfied with the work that Dr. Mudita Agrawal has provided.  It was pain free and she makes you feel at ease.

Front receptionist Laura is great too.  She has great customer service and is Spanish speaking.</review>

<Text>Having to find someone who cares about my teeth and smile as if it was their own, just feels amazing. The attention I receive, the welcoming greetings and the warm goodbyes are simply the best way to end your day. I have been through many Dental Doctors and many oral procedures, but I had never encounter one like Dr. Agrawal Mudita. She listens to me, she pays attention to every detail, and provides me with advise on how, and what is next to do.
I strongly recommend you come and visit Future Dental in redwood city.
It is close to Stanford, Mountain view, Palo Alto, Sunnyvale, Daily City but it is worth the drive!
. Wonderful staff and Dental providers.
. The inside environment is clean, and well organized.
. Easy to book an appointment.
. You will leave this place with the Best Dental experience of your life.

Both Shervin and Mudita have been very professional, knowledgeable and personable. They explain what is going on in X-rays instead of just telling you you need to get this or that done without deep explanations.</Review>

< review>
Dr. Mudita Agrawal is the BEST. I moved to the area and was looking for a good dentist. I started having a little tooth pain. Much to my chagrin, I couldn't find a dentist to squeeze me in until March of 2020 (it is currently December of 2019!). Somehow I found Dr. Agrawal. Around 4pm on December 24th, I filled out an appointment request. Within seconds, Dr. Agrawal responded. She followed up with a call and offered to STAY LATE TO SEE ME ON CHRISTMAS EVE so that we could take care of my pain right away. Not only did she do a great job, top-notch cleaning and equipment (she's gentle and has these cool cameras that do a close-up of every tooth!), but she's also incredibly fun, upbeat, and easy to talk to. Unlike most dentists, she takes breaks between looking into your mouth to get to know you. She ended up fixing my pain for a fraction of what I expected to pay. Can't recommend enough!</review>

The appointment with Dr. Mudita Agrawal was better than what I have ever experienced with my previous dentists. Dr. Agrawal was very attentive to my medical records, made sure I was listened to and explained the procedures I was going to undergo.

My experience was great from the beginning, with staff being very responsive and making themselves available to address all my questions.

For that I've referred my family and friends to FDC.</Text>

Shervin is excellent. A gentleman and a great dentist. Fast, efficient, deft, highly skilled. I was comfortable the entire time, no pain during or after and he did a great job. Probably one of the best, if not the best, dental experiences I've ever had (and I've had many!) Couldn't be happier. Highly recommended.<//Review>

This visit was quick and efficient. The manager explained my options and charges before hand to avoid misunderstandings later on. Only drawback the tech couldn't figure out the settings in my vehicle so the oil warning light is still on.</review>

Only 3 stars because:
-employee began apologizing to me for a potential long wait because they were “under staffed” (the two cars ahead of me actually left before service so I didn’t wait long at all)
- they were out of the oil I typically use so I was forced to buy a more expensive oil or leave and waste the time I already spent waiting
- the employee leaned on his desk and the desk on the shop floor collapsed. He gave a sigh that told me he “had it” for the day. Maintenance needs to happen for the employees to be happier.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1621579975362, 'text': 'Hi Justin,\n\nI know how important your time is, and I am so sorry that we missed the mark on this one!

Do Not use Jiffy Lube. I brought my car here to have a simple oil change. After listening to the tech bang on the undercarriage of my car for an hour and a half they came to me and told me that the cars oil plug had been stripped by the previous place who changed the oil. I informed them that I had brought it to another Jiffy Lube location located in Henderson NV which showed up in their computer system. Not taking any ownership of the problem they told me that they couldn't do anything and sent me on my way. After leaving I noticed that my oil pan was now dripping a large amount of oil onto the cement. I returned to the location where I reported to them that the car was now losing oil because they had tried to force the plug out with a screw driver and hammer. I was not told at the time but later found out from a call from the manager that the plug was sealed with silicone to temporarily seal the leak and send me on my way.

My car now needs a new oil pan and is leaking large amounts of oil until I can have it done. A simple oil change has now turned into a $500 ordeal because inexperienced techs improperly put the plug back in and then more inexperienced techs tried to use brute force to removed the plug.

If you think you are saving yourself money or time by stopping by this Jiffy Lube or any Jiffy Lube for that matter know that you are only going to have a harder time down the road because of the type of work that is done at this national chain.<//Review>< pics>

<username>BIKS<//username><Date>1621719682057</Date><rate>1<//rate><Text>We just had my daughter's car (Subaru Forester) in for an oil change. The fellow told her that the coolant was low and it would cost $450/ to fill it up. subsequently, my daughter got curious to ask to be shown the coolant levels. It turned out the coolant level was all right, and Jiffy Lube backed off their claim about low coolant levels.
I consider this cheating and un-professional of staff trying to take advantage of a young woman. Wonder how many people have been excessively charged by Jiffy Lube, trust and hope that this was a random event.< /Text>< pics>

Super professional people. Fast and quality work. The place is very clean, they operate the same meticulous way every time and offers  free fill up between scheduled oil change dates.

Also, completely safe and touchless during the pandemic. We basically stay in the car while they work.

Thank you so much Hezir and Iana!<//text>

In short the people who worked in this Jiffy Lube tried with good success in performing a needed service on my vehicle while trying to comply with the guidelines set down by the people who are dictating the requirements for the agenda they are pushing! Yeh this is a political statement but the hierarchy of Jiffy lube are doing the best that they can and I admire them for their courage!!!!!  They are doing a fine Job!!!< /text>

<rate>1<//rate><text>I have been a customer of the Glendale Avenue Jiffy Lube location for years. On October 17, 2020, I received terrible service during my oil change service.

During my visit, I was required to stay inside my car and roll down my driver's side window. Luis and Hezir did not keep the required six feet distance from me as required by the Los Angeles County Health Department due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

I asked Luis to clean my windows. He cleaned the front window and stopped. I had to ask him again to clean the back window which he did.

After the oil change was done, the change oil light on my dashboard did not go away. I asked Luis to reset the light as they have done in the past.

Luis proceeded to try to reset the change oil light. He was not wearing gloves as he touched my car's steering wheel and the inside of the driver's side door. He was unsuccessful in resetting the change oil light on my dashboard.

I asked Luis to give me a disinfectant wipe to clean where he had touched and he told me they had none.

I asked to speak to a manager to tell the person what had happened and to offer my constructive feedback. Hezir came to speak to me and told me that I had assumed the risk of visiting the store and that if I wanted better treatment I should go to the dealership.

I asked Hezir if he could repeat what he had said to me and allow me to record a video so that I can show it to his manager. He refused to do so.

I am extremely disappointed by the treatment I received during my last visit to the Glendale Avenue Jiffy Lube location. Luis and Hezir should receive further training, treat all customers better, and always deliver service that meets or exceeds the Jiffy Lube Pledge of Satisfaction.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

This is a great place for oil change . They not only change oil but there check your tires clean your windows and check all other fluids in your car .  If they noticed that some thing is wrongs they let you know like I had a valve cover gasget leaking Z they even have top off service  . Where you can go by  and they will check all fluids and tire pressure and fill oil if needed . Service is fast , very polite most of all patient ,  they took the time to explain every thing .<//review>

I went for a vehicle inspection. I called in first to inquire about the service and to make sure they are available on the weekends. Armando answered the phone and he was very helpful with great customer service. Next morning I took my car and it was a very good experience. I met Armando in person and he has a very good customer service in person as well. He told me it will be quick and sure enough it was a fast service. I definitely recommend this place.

Yeah after reading some reviews. I simply went to get my oil change today. The mechanic was nice however they're bit pricey for an oil change. I just hope it's been changed and nothing else will come up with my car. I will take my car to some where else and better price and effort going into it.<//Review>

<review>Absolutely the worse, I went at 5:30 PM to get my a/c recharge. The tech told me it wouldn't recharge and it could be my compressor. I took it to a mechanic in North Hollywood and they put freon in my vehicle and recharged my A/C. And now I have A/C. I don't know if they were inexperienced or ready to go. I am very disappointed.

They got oil all over the interior of my car and didn't know what oil to put in my 92 honda Civic. He literally had to ask me which oil my car took to put in. Sloppy service over all getting oil all over my engine and my door handles, shifter and steering wheel. I'd ask for a refund if I could.<//review>

<review>Update: i sent my information to be reached about this experience over a month ago before even writing this review and nobody attempted to reach out to me. But the moment i put this review, then i get a response asking for my contact info so someone can contact me.  It's frustrating to see that they're more concerned about these damn stars then actual customer service. You have my info jiffy lube, find it if you really want to provide me excellent customer service.

Over priced and they don't even fill up the fluids like they say they do. More concerned about up selling.<//review><user>114061295257508551671<//user><time>1534206213896</time>< gmapID>

Horrible experience!!! Unbelievable ,these guys are doing Fraud !!! They don’t changed the Oil and charge you for nothing !! My friend is an Mechanic hopefully he was with me ,when they told us that the car is ready ! He asked me to let him check the oil gauge , after he checked that out he told me the oil is like burned oil and is black ,and the sound of the engine is the same as before ! To make a long story short they don’t accepted and they charged me twice” so don’t take that risk it could be a severe damage on your car with this kind of services.<//review>

Don't go here!!!  It is the worst place to get an oil change and any other service!! They have messed up my car!!!  They are incompetent and rude. I call to speak with the manager and he's so unprofessional!!  Please don't come here!  I'm telling you because I've been trying to get them to fix the issue and they never do!

Update: I contacted them and no one ever got back to me. When they offer help is just to make them look like they want to help but they don't.</review>

Came in on 3/6/17 for an oil change... Today I got gas and had him check the oil, just because of a bad review I read. He said the oil needed changing. I was so heated I came back here. Felix is the one who took care of me then and when I explained the situation, he pulled me in, redid my oil change in front of me. Now that's customer service and I'll definitely be back. Way to go Felix,  high five!!!</review>

And they spilled oil in the engine compartment. So for three days it smelled like burning oil. All of the spilled oil was out of reach to try and clean up.

Wow. The Ritto burrido with brisket is beyond amazing. I got it with the ranchero sauce inside of it. I've worked at a smokehouse before and the meat here was intense. Thank you.</review>

Use to love Mill Creek, but since they have changed to Hickory Jacks I was open to trying them. Unfortunately it seems like there hours have changed because everytime I attempt to go they are closed. I have tried to come here 3 times and for some reason they are either closed early or for the day. I grow tired of continually wasting my time to attempt to eat here. I definitely won’t ever be coming here again. When they lost there name as Mill Creek they also lost a customer that recommended them to others.<//text>

{'time': 1617713150169, 'text': "Hi Gabriel. It sounds like you came by yesterday, April 5 and we were in fact closed to take care of some maintenance items that just cannot be done during business hours and needed to be addressed before covid restrictions are eased altogether. We chose this day because it was the day after a major holiday (Easter) and we expected to be slow. It was also the day that we knew our drive thru would be closed for an unknown length of time our new signs were installed. I posted closure information on our website and on Facebook and on our Google business page.\n\nAlthough there are a few holidays (New Year's Day, Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas) that we do close and other times (New Years Eve, 4th of July, Super Bowl Sunday) that we close early, we do adhere to our posted operating hours.\n\nMonday - Thursday: 11am to 7pm\nFriday: 11am to 8pm\nSunday: 11am to 6pm\n\nI'm sorry for the missed connection. Our goal is to be the best barbecue in the Inland Empire. I've operated for 3 years under the other brand. Hickory Jack's Barbecue is a change to the name only. Our ownership, service team, cook staff and core recipes remain unchanged. I hope we get a chance to see you again."}<//response>

Great food. The Brisket burger was amazing! The best part is that it doesn't use patty need, but rather real cuts of beef. The fries are well done, not beyond crispy but not soggy either. The cheesy broccoli tasted amazing, but it was hot! Hot as on temperature, not taste, lol.

The potato salad is a bit tarty though, so be warned about that. Definitely wasn't the favored side dish.< /Review>

I got a 3 meat plate with 2 sides. The brisket, spare rib, and sausage link were too salty and flavorless. The side of BBQ sauce was thin but didn't taste bad. The mac and cheese was bland. The three cheese potatoes looked disgusting but tasted ok.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

We ordered a 3-4 person family meal for two adults and a toddler, and it will definitely be enough for dinner for tomorrow, too!  The BBQ chicken, pulled pork, sweet potato fries (sweet honey sort of flavor), and cornbread (with delicious honey butter) were all really good. However, I wasn't a big fan of the onion rings or mac n cheese. We used a restaurant.com $10 off $20 voucher, so it was all a GREAT value for money, basically getting dinner for two adults, two nights in a row, for a total of about $20 ($5 per serving).

We had called ahead to order, and they were ready with our food to-go when we got there. :)< /review>

<text>This place has improved since the last time I came here. They have condensed the menu and the burgers are really good for their price point. I would come here again to try their BBQ. The burger was juicy and the brisket was tender. Also, their BBQ sauce are amazing and they have it spicy but not to spicy. All in all a great place.</text>< date>

<rating>4<//rating><text>Looking for a spot to grab lunch in Redlands, to yelp I go... Mill Creek Bar-B-Q was a pleasant surprise.  My husband and I split a pull pork and fries.  I love the fact that they have different Bar-B-Q sauces that you can apply yourself.  My hubby had to try them all...
The restaurant was clean and the staff friendly.  We got our food in a timely manner.  They also have a drive thru which I thought was interesting.  In all of my years of eating Q I've never seen a restaurant with a drive thru.  Nice touch.
This is someplace that I would revisit, next time trying the ribs or even a burger.
For you drinkers they do offer alcoholic beverages which can only be consumed inside of the the establishment.</text>< Pics>

My sister came home and shared one smoke Chicken  wing with me I called, ran down from Beaumont to pick up dinner for the entire family. I wanted everyone to taste this deliciousness. I ordered their smoked chicken wings, tri tip nachos, and macaroni and cheese yesterday. It was amazing, today my sister returned home with their wings  for dinner along with their smoke turkey breasts, it was outstanding this place is great I will return and I recommend if you love smoked meat this is the place.</Review>

Been here a few times for lunch. Their bbq is pretty good, albeit not fresh off the grill so it can dry out. The flavor is great, selection is massive, sandwiches are really tasty, meats are all really tasty, a good selection of sauces, and a small victory for me...Diet Mountain dew and Sobe lifewater on tap! Loved the chili and coleslaw, and the biscuit too!<//review>

We had lunch there today for the first time.  One of us had been there before and raved about Breakfast.  Unfortunately, we were late for breakfast.  I ordered a Cali burger.  It was larger than a regular burger!  Fries were good and so was the macaroni and cheese.  My friend had a tri tip sandwich and my other friend had the large cheeseburger, which he loved!
We all enjoyed lunch and left full!  We will return!< /Review>

Food is good. The meat I got on my salad was chewy so I suspect it wasn't cut properly against the grain. Fried pickles were amazing! But only there for a limited time. Prices are fair. Service is great.</Text>

Food was delicious. One of the best Turkey burgers I've ever had. Fries were crispy with a great flavor. Ribs were big and delicious, chicken flavorful and the side just right. Great prices. Brisket sandwich was perfect.<//Review>

Very good food. The menu has been shortened by new owners but food is still just as good. Enjoy the vibe, staff is friendly. They have a drive through and offer family meals. Have yet to tried the family meal but now I know they have it I will be ordering it. Also let me add the salads are amazing.< /Text>

We have obviously just changed the brand however the ownership and primary cooking staff are the same people so there really should not be any change to our food. It would be helpful to know what you thought was different so we can look into those items specifically.\n\nI’m sorry for the long wait time. We have brought on some new staff as it appears San Bernardino is moving to a less restrictive covid tier. I’m sure the wait time was mostly due to their inexperience but I promise we are working to move through that as quickly as we can.'}< /response>

<Text>Great kids meals, great price. Granddaughter enjoyed her rib and salad.
I had the pulled pork sandwich and potato salad. A little skimpy with the potato salad because it was very tasteful.😊 Pulled pork was very good. They were out of the Turkey so had to order the chicken sandwich which was actually very good.
Although, they clear their tables off in a timely manner, they need to wipe them off with a wet cloth. Our table was a little sticky.
I will return and order a family meal next time.< /Text><Date>1565655686914</Date>< UserId.>

Best barbecue ever,1. super fresh pork ribs that dont have even a hint of  that terrible porky aftertaste..2.the ribs have perfect ratio of rib meat to fat content and are super tender and moist 3. Their variety of sauces have a  fresh herb and spices profile that dont taste like processed super market brands 4. their buns are light,airy and delicate that allow all the smoke flavor of the meats to shine5. Their chicken is melt in your mouth delicate and free from any hint of gameiness<//text>

Amazing barbeque! I had the California Tri-Tip and it was so good! Atmosphere is nice and clean. Fun to experiment with their different barbeque sauces. Also the butter that you put on their cornbread is to die for.<//text>

This is a good one fashioned BBQ place that serves home style pulled pork and slice meat BBQ plates and sandwiches.  The meat is delicious, the price is fair, and the portions are nicely sized.  The dining room is clean with a feel of a Texas Roadhouse.  They also have family meals to go for a great price.<//text>

<text>Looking for a spot to grab lunch in Redlands, to yelp I go... Mill Creek Bar-B-Q was a pleasant surprise.  My husband and I split a pull pork and fries.  I love the fact that they have different Bar-B-Q sauces that you can apply yourself.  My hubby had to try them all...
The restaurant was clean and the staff friendly.  We got our food in a timely manner.  They also have a drive thru which I thought was interesting.  In all of my years of eating Q I've never seen a restaurant with a drive thru.  Nice touch.
This is someplace that I would revisit, next time trying the ribs or even a burger.
For you drinkers they do offer alcoholic beverages which can only be consumed inside of the the establishment.<//text>< GmapID>

<review>Mill Creek was very good to eat... If you have not been there yet, I would recommend the "Tour". The Tour consists of 3 sliders that are built on very buttery pieces of bread and the meats you get are one Tri Tip, one Brisket and one Pulled Pork. Then you get a choice of a side... I got the Sweet Potato Fries and they were very good if you are into that. The BBQ sauce was really good and not too sweet. The staff is very friendly when you walk in, during your stay and even when you leave. I would recommend the place to everyone.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Date>

Pretty good BBQ...didn't really like the cornbread too much...but I didn't go for that...their meats are always tender and I haven't had any complaints so far.. I'm a return customer...also if you like their page on Facebook they send you great coupons to use...can't beat that! Great value on the coupons to not cheesy offers< /Review>

<review>Prices were good for the amount of food!
However the Mac & cheese was terrible, even my 3 and 7 year old refused to eat it.
Everything else was Perfect!!

Good food however, portions are generous  so either be very hungry when you come in or bring a friend to share it. The dining room was clean an orderly. There is outside seating . The wait staff was efficient and courteous. The parking outside is on the smaller side. I would return when I'm in the area.< /Text>

<Review>I do enjoy this place quite a bit. It's really good BBQ and I know good Texas BBQ. for So Cal this is one of the best BBQ places around and most of the meals are a pretty good value. The sandwiches are large and the sauces are delicious. Pulled pork is fantastic.

It had been remodeled within the year and looks great. If you haven't checked it out you definitely need to add it to your any list and get over there!

John is also great. Keep up the good work.<//Review>< Pics>

It reminds me of when my dad used to grill on the barbecue, perfect moist chicken and sauce that is not too spicy for me. For $10 I can get a quarter chicken, two sides, a corn bread and a drink. That is a good deal in my book. The staff has always been really cool to me.<//Review>< userid>

Very good BBQ place. We were in the mood for bbq, we saw a sign, decided to try it out, and loved it. We got the family meal of rins and pulled pork and it was delicious. Their service was excellent. U could ask their opinion and they give u good answers not just something to get u to order. Going back for sure.<//Text>

My favorite thing about Mill Creek are the sweet staff, they are full of charisma and smiles, my waitress Hannah even held the door open for my family as we left. My son loves their chicken strips and fries, my Grandma enjoys the chili bowl. Even when they closed they dont make you feel rushed to finish eating so they can go home. The most genuine hospitality I've had in a long time!<//Text>

Saw this restaurant on Restaurant Impossible with Robert Irvine today and I live in Michigan.
Would love to go there if I ever get back to California.</Text>

Ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich. The meat was good and the top bun was good but the bottom bun was saturated... I mean SATURATED in grease! I ate everything but the bottom bun. When the lady from the front counter came to take our plates, she asked how everything was. I told her nicely and grabbed the bun and was able to squeeze 1/3 cup of grease from the bun... she told me it was the juice. I know the difference between juice from a roast and grease. It was pure grease. My hand was shiny! She told me to order the brisket next time. Not sure if it's worth going back for a greasy bun. It was never like that before.<//review>

The brisket was a little dry. However, the three cheese potato was an excellent side. While the food wasn't bad overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to come back.<//review>

We love this place when driving between palm springs and Los angeles.  Fantastic food, great and friendly service. It is very accessible and right off the freeway.  We have had many items here and all are fantastic but the fried pickels are unique and extraordinary.< /Text>

<Review>My 1st experience did not go too well. I ordered the sloppy pig sandwich (after reading the rave reviews) and a side of mac n cheese. My husband ordered a rib plate with sweet potato frys and onion rings. I requested extra bbq on the side. Our mouths watered all the way home to Moreno Valley. Got home and found no bbq sauce but instead ranch dressing. My husband's ribs were very dry. I ordered regular slaw on my sandwich and got spicy which was VERY spicy. I couldnt find any other toppings on my sandwich (bacon crumbles...etc) maybe they were there but I just couldnt taste them through the spicy slaw. The mac n cheese was very dry and all I could taste was pepper. Needless to say we were very disappointed especially after all the rave reviews we had read.</Review>< pics>

This place is a hidden gem! We stumbled across it on the way to the mountains and were seriously impressed. The staff is nearly as exceptional as the food. 20 years of searching for BBQ in SoCal and this is the hands down winner.< /review>

<review>Dropped by late one afternoon for the first time.  So happy I did!  Love, love, love the food.  Awesome ppl working there, very enthusiastic about what they're serving up there.  And rightly so.  I had the 5 pc beef rib, they were huge, tons of, fall off the bone,  meat.  Huge portions on the sides too.  I chose sweet potato fries and onions rings, both were great.  The ambulance is casual, low key country music pipped in, not too loud, just enough.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Food is BOMB!!! But please cut the tri tip thin, last few times I went it was too thick , and just recently it was thin again. I love it when its cut thinly. Other than that, this place is always a must go to when I'm in the area. Not to mention, it's very cute and country from the inside. I really enjoying having a meal Inside.<//review>

<rating>1<//rating><text>Owner was a complete dueschbag. Went in with my daughter and my friend and his daughter. Waiter didn't bring my complete food order. Then I was told I didn't order the food I thought I did. I was fine not eating this fake bbq and let It go. My friend on the other hand went to complain and was greated with a piss poor response from the owner. If this is how they treat retired military I am ashamed for them. Highly recommend investing in better security cameras as the next people you treat this way may not take it so lightly after all your restaurant is in a dump of a neighborhood. Would give it zero stars if it was an option. Most likely family owned as his giant ego suggests. Good luck selling your swill you call BBQ to the unknowing public. Will make sure to let all active and retired military friends know to black list this joint.<//text>< Resp>
{'time': 1565095945024, 'text': "I'm sorry you feel the way that you do Scott and regret that you have resorted to name calling and badmouthing.\n\nThere is no doubt that the young man who took the order made a mistake and a plate was not added but you were also not charged for it. Your friend made it clear that the only solution that would be entertained was for us to provide the missing plate at no charge. While I did think that a discount was in order, and I told him I'd give him a good deal, I did not agree that the mistake was egregious enough to warrant a $15 meal for free. However, your friend left no room for discussion and the conversation deteriorated as he tried to back me into a corner.\n\nAs for military, I have two sons serving - one in Afghanistan and one just finishing his AIT. We also employee veterans. I'm afraid you've missed the mark on our support for active duty soldiers and veterans.\n\nI know your day started off with a disappointing visit to the waterpark across the street and I sincerely wish that we had not made a mistake that only added an exclamation point to your day's frustration."}</Resp>

Went there today for the first time and the staff was super nice and their food is so good. I got the BBQ brisket, coleslaw and cheese fries and they're tasty. They had a big selection of other things I'd like to go back and try.<//Text>

This is the worst place I have ever had the misfortune of eating at. Staff is rude and incompetent. Food was awful, over cooked and favorless. Never going back, absolutely do not recommend.</Review>

Good bar be que definitely was pleasantly surprised. The tri-tip and brisket is tender, smoky and well seasoned.  The drive thru can take awhile  but considering its bbq, the wait was tolerable. Overall no complaints a must try if you want some good bbq in the area. Prices are a little high but definitely worth it.</review>

<Review>This reviews for The Mill Creek restaurant off of California Street in Redlands. Not the larger facility in Mentone. Mill Creek is a great little restaurant they have plenty of space to sit down and enjoy the meal there. Food is made to order, it is not a fast food restaurant. It therefore will take a little while longer to get your food, which you should be aware of if you want to go through their drive-thru. But it is worth it! it. The burgers are delicious and brisket is to die for. French fries are Perfection, some of the best I've ever had.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1554986454710, 'text': "I can't express how much I appreciate your review, David. You said exactly what I'd like to get across to every who comes in, especially regarding our drive thru. We always try to be quick but it takes a few minutes to cook a fresh 1/3 pound burger. Without a doubt, you hit everything and I'm grateful that you took the time to share your thoughts."}<//response>< GmapID>

The salad has lots of vinegar on the marinated cabbage and over powers the salad but the brisket is delicious and so is the pulled pork.< /review>

Counter person talked so fast had to ask about the order twice. Told her twice I'm allergic to onions, order still came with onions. Looked at the order and she did not write down "no onions". Sent order back. Hamburger had very little flavor. My husband rated his ribs as "ok". Not someplace we would return</text>

<Text>I've been searching for a place that rivals in my opinion the trip tip sandwich from Lucille's and man was I not disappointed with Mill Creek! The sandwich on its own with no sauce was great, the smokey flavor came through and the meet was very tasty no need for sauce here but I did any way and it just got better with sweet sauce.<//Text>< user>

The kid behind the counter was very very good at what he did, he was enjoyable to deal with and helpful.  He kept the place clean too.  The food however had a bad taste from the beef to the beans nothing was good.  Maybe get the kid to make the food too since he did a great job at everything else.  Get him some decent help in there, you guys werent busy so why was he doing everything, will get his name if we go in again.</Review>

The sliders were all warm and full of tender meat; ready for their bbq sauce which was on the side.  These are a great value and hit the spot.  They have really tasty bbq sauce.  The potato salad wasn't special.  It tasted like store bought.  Had peach cobbler.  We got take out so the ice cream it was served warm with melted by the time we ate it.  It had nice flavor and the crust was tender.  Recommend. Service was friendly.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<text>I got there two minutes before closing because I was stuck in traffic driving back from Los Angeles, and the lady was very kind and didn't make me feel like a jerk. So now, not only do I love there food, but I respect their service and quality in staff even more.<//text>< gmapID>

Everything about this place is horrible.  Horrible food and horrible service.  Even the presentation of the food when you get it looks bad.  The food is ALWAYS cold by the time you get it.  I've given this place about 3 tries and everytime is worst than the last.  I've only kept going because it's close to my work but I'll never make the mistake of going there again.  I told my coworkers about it and they all knew already because they hate that place too.  They agreed with me and said they also always screwed up their orders. Also the place seems to be run by a bunch of young kids that obviously have horrible work ethics because their customer services is ridiculous.  Never ever again.<//Review>

This place is a hidden gem. Big BBQ dishes at good prices.Their rewards program is bomb. Their house salad is my favorite. Their meats are incredible.< /text>

In addition to the delicious brisket and small town experience, the customer service is excellent. I believe the mature aged man taking drive-thru orders is the owner. He is super awesome, friendly, efficient, welcoming, and genuine. He's the reason I am a frequent customer.< /text>

Two of three pork ribs were cold and they all were dry! Meat also tasted old. The prices are too high for it not being fresh.< /Review>

Friendly, playful, knowledgeable staff, and fantastic food! Not the cheapest place around, but the food is easily worth the price! Do yourself a favor and try this place if you haven't already.< /Review>

<Text>Great potential!  Great set up and menu. I give 3 stars because cook is using way too much salt. Even onion rings were salty. Got the piggy sandwich and was needing more juice. FLAVOR IS ON POINT. I've been to BBQ's all over the south and mid west. Just need a little "BAM". Only reason I'm commenting is because your flavor is great, and am tired of driving long distances for good BBQ.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Horrible food! Daughters chic fingers where snappy like chewing a  rubber band. The chic on the salad was the same,  cucumbers were soggy and old. The apples tasted like dirt! Will never go there again!!< /Review>

I have gone in there and from the very first time, the help is horrible.  The help I'm talking about is an older woman, who works weekdays... Obviously shot out from work and must be looking for another career.  Even looks like it is painful to pick up a plate, or take a plate to a table.  She eventually came over to serve me and then splashed my beer all over my hand, and the counter.  The next time in there, the same woman wouldn't even bother to walk over.  Yelled from the other end of the room, what I wanted.  She still didn't get my order, and Albert, the bartender finally got it.  I would love to speak to the manager about her behavior and lazy attitude about things.  I did say something to Albert, who everyone seems to know and constantly butters up to.  He said that it's not her fault that it get's really busy.  Doesn't matter... It wasn't busy at the time I was there.</review>

Had the Chicka Chicka Bone or whatever, two pieces of chicken and 3 big pork spare ribs. Deelicious! If you like your sauce thick and sweet. Had cole slaw and Mac&Cheese. Cole slaw was good. Mac and cheese could have been a little cheesier. Great atmosphere, great service.</Text>

<Text>Two times I've come to the mentone one.  Both times we were ready to walk out ...terrible wait for menus, drinks, orders, and grub.  BUT the food is good, not great.  Won't come here anymore.  But the Redlands one is spot on service.!!!</Text></record></dataset><record>

The food was awesome and was very happy with the quality for price especially the onion rings . Bomb! How ever during my visit i used the restroom ...... And this was kinda creepy to me . they have a mirror that is about 12x12 at the hieghth of the top of the sink facin the toliet and unless your height is 2foot8inches tall you will have to bend over to you knees to get a glimpse of yourself. Very very strange. Needless to say. I will eat there again and definitely use the restroom elsewhere. Hope this was helpful</text>

<Rate>4< /Rate><review>How is this the best pico I've ever had in my life? They also gave me straight up half an avacado for an omelet. Tater tots are deep fried, bbq sauce is good, spicy slaw is good. The edges of the place are a little worn. Holes in the furniture, rips in signs, etc, etc. If that matters to you, you may not be happy. But the food is good for a price that is appropriate.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Amazing place to get a bite to eat. There bbq taste amazing. My favorite thing to get is the  chile cheese fries with Tri tip on top with extra bbq sauce I know it sounds weird but it's amazing. There bbq plates are really good to. The staff here is always helpful and the place is super clean.</review>

I love this restaurant & want it to stay open. I'm offering what I deem helpful suggestions.
Because your burger buns are homemade & so delicious you might (at the very least on to go & drive up orders not add the BBQ sauce on the burger). Reason being the is sauces thinkness has changed & it soaks thru the bun & literally falls apart as you eat it. Having it on the side one can add it when tbey start eating.+ please don't pawn cold fries off on the drive thru people.
2ndly I just go a drive thru order about 2 hours ago. I ordered the sliders. They did grill the buns but they were cooled when I got home & they were dry & you could tell not fresh. This is not the 1st time this has happened on a drive thru order at least for me. + the small amount even used for a pork slider, the pork was dry around the edges & just not good. This only happens (again at least for me) on drive thru orders.
I want to say again these are suggestions. The staff is great, friendly. I've eaten here since the opening, volunteered when Robert Irvine came & went & really applaud your success.</Text>

<text>This used to be one of my favorite places. Since original owner left, this place change a lot. Quality is not the same. Burger used to be thick and juicy,  more like home made. Now it looks like a Walmart paty.  I was really disappointed.  Fries are not the same. Chilli cheese fries were soggy.  This place used to be so delicious 5 plus stars, now i prefer Carl's jr😕👎👎👎👎
Update, All the improvement had made on the tech side and those are ok. Trust me, i loved this place, I was to in love with the burgers and briskets meals. But its sad to say, food its not the same as used to be when mom and pop where there. I had been a customer for many years. I wouldn't criticize a place that i love the food. Sometimes all the advertising that you need is quality. I see the difference, not the same. Sorry, but honestly.<//text>< Pictures>

{'time': 1554134363148, 'text': "I'm disappointed to read that you thing our quality has gone downhill. I've worked hard to increase the freshness of all our bar-b-q, especially our spare ribs, tri-tip and brisket. We still continue to press our fresh hamburgers by hand each day and they're served on the same house-made buns. We did make a change to the fries about a year ago, but that was after testing the current style with customers who overwhelmingly thought they were better so again, a move for improved quality. Thanks for sharing. It's clear that we still have work to do."}<//resp>

<review>OMG, I had a mean craving for  BBQ Tri Tip. I looked up BBQ near me and Voila!  I am sooo glad I picked Mill Creek Cattle Co. in Redlands. They even have a drive thru! Judy and Jim were just the most pleasant and friendly people. Jim was so cute and just full of personality. I am in heaven eating this meal. Best choice and best restaurant BBQ I have EVER  had! Their sides are amazing too.  I got the 3 cheese potatoes and cheesy brocoli. Oh and the corn bread muffin is excellent too!  Please give them a try. You won't regret it. I have found my BBQ Heaven! Thanks Judy & Jim!< /review>< username>

<review>We decided to get breakfast there because we saw some reviews online and we also read some that stated that they just got remodeled on restaurants impossible. We like that show so we were pretty excited to go there and check it out. Things started out pretty well it was obvious that it was professionally remodeled, and it looked great. When we ordered things started to go downhill. We both ordered breakfast and we are told that they're out of hashbrowns so we had a get tater tots instead. They want to breakfast team one of them actually had hashbrowns and we got them to get us more hashbrowns for the other plate. One dish we ordered was the veggie omelette which was actually pretty good, however the hashbrowns were pretty bland. The other dish we ordered was a breakfast with potatoes eggs and biscuits and gravy, which we're told there out of biscuits then the guy tried to get us to get toast with gravy. Are you serious toast with gravy come on? I ended up getting French toast instead which was pretty bland my eggs were supposed to be over easy they came out more like over medium. While we sat and ate our breakfast we could tell that there were other tables I had issues with their food. Overall we are not really that impressed and don't think will be back for a long time. Chef Robert Irvine along with restaurants impossible was only there two weeks ago and I think someone needs to let him know that he needs to go back and fix this place. The episode is going to air in March 2014, and I hope they get their act together by then or else they're not gonna be able to watch their own show.< /review>< Rating>
