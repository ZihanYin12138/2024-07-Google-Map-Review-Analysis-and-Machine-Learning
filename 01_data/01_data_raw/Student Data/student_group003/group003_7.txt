I was looking forward to checking this place out and finally got a chance to stop by here for lunch.
Very nicely designed interior with a bar and outside seating as well. Good choice of beers on tap and a full kitchen.
I ordered what came recommended, which was a sandwich with both turkey and pulled pork as well as a small soup on the side.
Sandwich was quite boring and had more mustard that it needed which, when combined with the pickles resulted in it being too salty and sour with no other taste despite the pulled pork, which according to the staff is cooked in-house. In addition the bread roll was a bit big for the content of the sandwich so I had to remove half of it, which luckily removed some of the mustard as well.
The soup (chicken and rice) was just as dull with no flavor aside from its acidity. The one good thing in it was the red quinoa, which was cooked perfectly and gave it a pleasant, grainy crunch. The white rice was just a cheap filler and did nothing to improve it. I think that a much better soup can be made from grains and veggies with chicken for about the same cost.
I must add that the gentlemen who was serving me was exceptionally polite and helpful and even ran after me to give me the baseball cap I had forgotten.
So maybe this restaurant has better items that I didn't get to try, but in my opinion, if you put something on the menu, you should make it worth tasting. Anyway, I wish them luck.<//text>

<Review>Great spot for lunch. We showed up during happy hour so got a deal on drinks and food. I had the chicken club which was really good. Buddy had the sliders. He got three of them off the happy hour menu. They don’t have hard liquor but they do have a great selection of beer and wine. I will be back.</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWYOUtmKsJJTyoazi5_8mp7uzB2ww9Oq1Xbbnl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Resp>

Talk about hospitality. I brought my son here for his 14th birthday. Just the two of us and the chef came out asking us for a personal order. The food was exceptionally artistic yet homey. Set right with the stomach....and if you are looking for a good bloody Mary...here we are.
Thanks spice and soul...for making it great! Thanks jayce...< /review>

Very cool vibe here. They have a bar, several indoor tables, and an outdoor area as well.

They have a great selection of beers, as well as the basic variety of wines. They appear to specialize in pulled pork and brisket. They also have some chicken and turkey sandwiches, several salads, and a bunch of appetizers.

Most of what we had was pretty good. Prices are fair, and during happy hour there are some real values. Service was good.</review>

I was in the area and stopped by for a quick lunch with a pint. There is a cute outdoor patio area and the interior is welcoming and well lit.

I had the BBQ sandwich with pulled pork and a blood orange IPA. The pickled onions were a great touch! (Seeing Alpine Duet on the beer menu is also a bonus.) Staff is very friendly and I didn't wait very long for my food to arrive. Seems like a great place for solo diners, couples, or small groups.< /Text>

Awesome place for local beers. They also have an extensive menu of dishes made by the owners and employees collectively. The hummus trio is quite delightful.  I wasn't hungry enough for them but was informed by our server they are going to start doing mac n cheese balls. I will be back to try more of their delicious menu and have no doubt in time this will be another great local hotspot.<//Review>

<review>Amazing Tacos - definitely go there on a Tuesday!  Super tasty and especially loved the carnitas (wish they served it every day). Oksana the waitress is a delight and worked hard to make everything perfect.  Husband had chicken and Mac n cheese, said it was a solid 4.5 but could have had more spice to it.  On our second visit I had the shrimp tacos that were great as well (I'd ask for more sauce on the side next time tho). Husband raved about the burger, said it was delicious and juicy.  We shared the fries that were hot and fresh.  Overall, 2 excellent visits.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

The blackened salmon and rib-eye (separate dishes) are spicy but perfectly done. The real gem is the Mac-N-Cheese though! This isn't Kraft instant mix... it's real adult food! I had it with the brisket and it was awesome.

If you like appetizers I recommend the salt n pepper wings or the brussel sprouts.<//Review>< pictures>

Not a great first impression. We were a party of 8 + a baby. We arrived and it took a while before someone came over and ordered our drinks. I had ordered a coffee and was warned that they would need to brew it so it would be a little wait which was fine. But I had to ask for it 2 more times and finally got it after about 20 minutes. This wasn't too big of a deal and they kindly offered to comp it which was nice. I had the BBQ chicken flatbread which was very good. Honestly the food was all good and we really enjoyed the sauces for the wings. But the service was so slow. We had to wait a while to order drinks, we had to wait a while to order appetizers, we had to wait a while to order entrees, we had to wait a while to order dessert and then had to wait a while to get the check and for them to take the payment. And they weren't very busy at all, so we weren't sure what was going on. Luckily we didn't have a real time crunch, but if you're on a bit of a schedule and have places to go, be prepared to have to keep on the servers to make sure you can get out in a timely manner. We were there for almost 2 and a half hours overall. Again, it wasn't too terrible, but be prepared for bad service.<//Text>

Much like their music playlist, this place is having an identity crisis and isn't quite sure what to be. Weird decor trying to be hipster but stuck off Moreno by the Costco.
Food wasn't very good, meat was dry. Good beer options.
Trivia nights on Wednesdays at 7!are loud, don't show if you want a semi quiet dinner.
They're definitely trying. Maybe a little too hard. Figure out who you are "spice and soul."<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

< Review>
Spice & Soul is a neat little restaurant that's off the uber-crowded beaten paths. We found ourselves there after being unable to find parking in Little Italy.

We had wanted pizza, but the pizza place across the street was closed, so Spice & Soul would have to do. We ordered a trio of appetizers: the tri-tip flat bread, the clucks and fries, and the hot mess fries.

The flat bread was fresh and light with a pesto aioli alongside mozzarella serving to cut the heaviness of the tri-tip. The clucks and fries were... Well, they were definitely chicken fingers and fries. Nothing much exciting there, though they were tasty.

The plate that stole the show for me was the hot mess fries. I had wanted it with brisket, but they were out, so I got pork instead. The fries came topped with mountains of meat and cheese. The pork was tender and smoked to perfection. Fantastic!

Spice & Soul gets a 4/5 with me. There was nothing objectionable about their food, but I found it all to lack dimension. I loved the hot mess fries, but it was still missing a little bit of zing or pizzazz to me, and the rest of the food was fine, but not great.

Absolutely check this place out if you're into craft beers, of which there are many, or if you're looking for some great smoked pork. Enjoy!</Review>

This really is an old fashioned Italian deli & pizzeria. From the hanging sausages in front of the menu, to the home baked bread for the sandwiches everything is the same as it would have been 70 - 80 years ago. I had the Beef tongue sandwich, it was awesome. I also love the fact that they put a tall bottle of water on your table so that you don't have to ask for refills.</Text>

<review>During a visit to Sausalito, we stopped here because of reviews on Find Me Gluten Free.  I had a great salami sandwich on toasted gluten free bread.  Wonderful.... but I really envied my wife for her Insalata Italiana which was superb,<//review>< username>

<Text>Stopped off here as an outdoor seat had just become available....but later they brought tables out from the restaurant for folk who wanted to be outside. V accommodating!
Salads were great and the pizza was nice and light. We also had a few bottles of pretty strong Rosè wine which was very reasonably priced.
Deserts weren't amazing - looked like they were mass produced/bought in. Tasty none the less.
Staff nice too.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>Simple and unfussy,  Venice Deli maintains an overwhelming conglomeration of all products Italian while also appearing quaint and orderly. Unlike its neighboring eateries, you don't have to dip into your child's college savings for a meal (unless you are one of those Chegg yuppies then you can use this saved money to pay off student loans), and can still walk away with a completely satisfying meal. Take your food across the street and eat by the water. This was also the day I lost Deshaun Watson to an ACL tear :(< /review>< pictures>

Well if u were around in SF and u wanted to pass by the lovely town called Sausalito which I definitely recommend! Make sure to drop by this lovely diner and make sure to get the chowder! The place is super simple but great and generous food...<//text>

The food is nice and tasty, with a great outdoor area to sit and enjoy the view.  It's small and always busy during lunch time so you'll have people lining up waiting for your seats.</review>

Great place! Had a wonderful time at an affordable price, owner was very polite and food was good, we were a group of 12 and order different appetizers to the center. DIY Mimosas were the perfect touch! Recommend it!< /text>

<Review>This place is highly overrated. The kinda attention it's getting because it is located at the downtown. The food I ordered was less than average. So people place your bet wisely, find a better place.< /Review>< Pictures>

< review>
from Tennessee...found this deli on internet, sounded authentic. when we got to sausalito, ordered one of the delicious sandwiches, wanted to sit outside to eat and look at the Bay but no tables were vacant. the owner went and got a table and 2 chairs so we could sit outside. he even brought us a candy for dessert. he was Wonderful and so were the sandwiches. we bought an extra to eat out on the Golden Gate Bridge! we got a towel souvenier with the Venice Gourmet logo on it! and a pic with the owner!!! he was great...i wish i remembered his name! i'm sending friends from TN & Germany who are coming out to visit SF area! wish i could come out with them! Find the owner, he's interesting...been there 40+ yrs...and you'll love the food/items at Venice!</review>

(Translated by Google) Good and delicious food, but the portions are not that big. We could easily eat great dessert on top. Drinking water tasted of chlorine.

< review>
(Translated by Google) Finally after 15 days of junk food we were finally able to eat a great sandwich with authentic flavors and not necessarily modified by spices and sauces, with a wonderful view of the San Francisco skyline.
A must try if you are in the Sausalito area.

Finalmente dopo 15 giorni di cibo spazzatura siamo finalmente riusciti a mangiare un ottimo panino dai sapori autentici e non necessariamente modificati da spezie e salse,con una vista dello skyline di San Francisco meravigliosa.
Assolutamente da provare se siete in zona Sausalito.< /review>

<Review>i will say subs are ok nothing to write home about. the only reason im giving this place a one star is because of all the teenagers  they have working there have no clue on how to take orders. I went there because of my daughter she said they were they greatest thing since sliced bread.(i have a different opinion.)

Anyway so we ordered 2 number 13s and a Chipotle sub we paid we looked at our receipt only to find out the girl taking our order only charged us for 1 number 13 and a chipotle sub. so we told her about our order she charged for the other number 13  sub by this time the place was full we had to wait and extra 10 minutes for our order to be filled.

i mean it is crazy how these kids don't pay attention when people place their orders. I will nor recommend this place to anyone nor will i visit this place ever again.

please train your employees better and don't put the radio too loud so your employees can take orders properly .<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6vovJpK2EAgHfdBulQHLrYeE9RxXaspOhcEJu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOkZ_2AxctSIZz7nm87mBzgC4Q4AhYXkngIb9uD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Resp>

<Review>When i went to this place I ordered 3 sandwiches. Nobody said one word to me. So I walked over to the cash register.....they told me how much i owed ..I paid and left. When i got home and noticed i only had 2 sandwiches. So i called and basicly they tried to blame it on me. Now i dont know their rules and they never told me. I certainly would not pay them....then leave without my stuff!! They are unprofessional and just rude to customers. I would not recommend this place.< /Review></record>

Just dont send your kids to order for u. Apparently they will automatically skimp on the bacon and mayo if u dont specify wanting it. Even though it clearly is listed as an ingredient on the menu. I asked for a giant 8 and 9. And neither came witb bacon or mayo. And she said Mike's way no onion.< /text>

<Review>Love Jersey Mikes Sub's. Ever since childhood in North Carolina. Sadly, they have raised the prices of their sandwiches at this location so much that I have stopped going. Raise the price but I don't get more food!? Nope! That's a fail. Don't get greedy. You'll lose a paying consumer. Cudos to great sandwiches always.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>Over priced for my taste. Menus says "Any combination welcome" but when I asked to substitute capacolla for bacon they said they couldn't because it was "a different price point" which I could accept if there were not sandwiches in the same section, for the same price with those meats on them. I'll try anything twice, and after 2 trys here, I won't go back<//Review><username>Andrew Villalobos Jr<//username>< pics>

Great subs no matter what but staff seems to be lost. They need to find their grove. Really slow but expected for a new store. Month or two and they’ll be on par with timing with other stores.</Text>

<text>Subs are delicious as always but they need to work on priority when it comes to online/phone order pickups. Stood at the register for close to 10 minutes without anyone acknowledging us when I could clearly see that the order was finished. Had to bother an employee for our order pickup. Otherwise, the order was corect and the sandwiches were spot on. Will come here again soon.</text><UserId.>113203477035098831364<//UserId.>< time>

Wanted to check out what the hype was all about, not so great after all.. super salty with soggy bread 😖 overloaded on the shredded lettuce. And not too many options on toppings..turkey bacon would be nice. Not my cup of tea. Subway it is!</Text>

They shouldn't of opened yet and trained more. Really slow, don't bag your sandwiches when they are done just handle them to you, yawning at the cashier stand, claiming & frustrated when it's packed. Won't go there right now.< /Review>

<text>As soon as I walked through the doors I was told they were closed. Looked at my phone, it was 6:01 and I looked at the sign, said they closed at 6. Still customers being served inside, doors open. Employee was rude as hell. Yeah, it's New Years Eve but seriously, 1 minute. My first time there, only open a week, and I won't be going back. Guess you dont want my money. Went next door to Chipotle instead. Happy New Year!</text>< Pictures>

The customer service was absolutely terrible they're not patient at all with you feels like your being rushed and answer every single one of your questions with attitude honestly I've liked going to every other jersey Mike's subs I've been too but this is by far the worst I'm glad they brought it to the valley so I dont have to go to santa Clarita or Valencia or topanga but they really need to clean house get rid of all these lazy attitude filled employees and management and get some real people who wanna work not want everything handed to them and expect to go in to get a paycheck and not get annoyed everytime they see a customer walk in.< /Review>< GmapID>

It's the 2nd time, 2nd location I've been to and it was good. Came here with family I have in the area, it is fresh  but I still think its pricey for sandwiches.  Not a quick lunch spot for me. The sandwiches are giant  so I always share, only eat about a  third myself.< /text>

YB is the only store in Downtown Grass Valley where you can find quality clothes for men and women, a very cute pair of shoes, pickles for cocktails, up to the minute home goods , a stylish handbag and many more must have items and have everything you purchase gift wrapped!

I was visiting from the east coast for a wedding and spending some time window shopping in Grass Valley when I stumbled upon this store. The employees were so kind and incredibly helpful. Their selection of items was so diverse from clothing to shoes to jewelry, bath items and beyond. I found the cutest, most unique shoes here! All the ladies at the store are so friendly. You can tell that they love their job, and that makes the experience so much more enjoyable for the customer. I just wish they had a way to purchase their merchandise online! Please check out this store. It is so cool and fun!</Text>

There’s housewares, clothing and beauty. There’s so much to see and all of it unique that you could spend hours discovering new and cool stuff. The clothing side is really expensive ($140 for a skirt) and the sizes run very small!! The staff is always very nice and helpful, but the girls in the clothing section tend to hover like you’re about to shop thrift everything, makes for a very nerve racking and uncomfortable shopping experience.  Overall it’s a great store to mill around and you’re guaranteed to find something cool to buy.</Review><pics>None</pics><user_name>Isla Rose Fitzgerald</user_name>< user>

Was there at 445, picked out a few things to try on . I asked to try on shoes and was told they had to close register. It was 502. I could come back tomorrow. At 505 went into LaTeDa and purchased 3 pairs of shoes $435 and was done at 517.</text>

<text>During the week of May 13, 2014 for my 80th birthday we visited Grass Valley for the first time. What made it so special was stopping in at Yuba Blue. It was the most enjoyable shop for two reasons:
(1) One could not ask for a most friendly helpful group of sales ladies..
(2) The selection of items was outstanding.
My wife purchased a most beautiful plate that made our visit to the store the high lite of our trip to the area.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<review>Owner is VERY RUDE! I've been coming here since they opened. She yells at her employees. Accent is difficult to understand.  Its advertised ALL YOU CAN eat as of yesterday you can no longer do that. THEN WHY IS IT ADVERTISED that way? She said "can get 2 bowls ONLY" but will be 18.25 not 8.99....THATS IT...thats NOT all you can eat. Looks I won't be returning for a long time!<//review></record></dataset><record>

My family and I stop by for Mongolian BBQ everytime we are in Moreno Valley.  I have always had a great experience.  Last week, I was really disappointed.  The fried food tasted like it was cooked in old grease.  The shrimp fried rice was dry and the shrimp didn't taste good.  The soup had a strong seafood taste.  I had to throw most of the food away.  My family would not eat it.< /Review>

We love eating here.. the lady who runs it can be a little straight forward but she deals with alot of BS. 😂 From the neighborhood. She's actually the sweetest person once she knows your not going to act shady. Food is always bomb. Service is great.<//Review>

<text>I went with my wife to eat yesterday for the 5th time and we got our food and took it to the chef to cook, everytime we had went it was an all you can eat buffet as it is advertised on the restaurants window, but this time the lady wanted to charge us for every plate we would get saying that though its a buffet we could only get food one time and that we would be charged for every plate we got after the first time, she also didnt know how to explain why she was trying to charge us for every plate we got so we ended up leaving, we had been coming here for years and they have lost a customer due to their false advertisement, this is no longer an all you can eat buffet<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< name>

They provide generous portions and for inexpensive rates. We enjoyed the food very much and the staff members were very amiable and chatty. Will definitely recommend this spot.Tables were clean and in good shape. No offensive smells. Food was prepared and cooked in quick and efficient manner. Everything I had ordered was very delicious and hot when it was served to me.</review>

I admire this spot! They offer tasty dishes, they have a nice menu, The cook in that place is an expert, I love very much trying all their food. The dishes are consistently tasty, the service towards the guests  is efficient. I  go often to this place and I not even once was unsatisfied. Highly recommended.<//Review>

I've been here a number of times (lunch and dinner, over the past 3 years or so) and have always had a great experience. The decor isn't much to look at, but all of the food I've had has been extremely fresh and well-prepared. The buffet has a good variety, and all of the fresh veggies are beautiful. And you can't beat the price! Added bonus - I've got fairly serious food allergies, and the way they heat the food, it keeps your stuff on a single space on the griddle. I've been to other Mongolian places where they move the food across the whole griddle, so your stuff gets a lot of contamination from other peoples' plates, but here, your food stays on one section of the griddle until it is done.</Text>

Love eating at this place all the time.  They have Mongolian BBQ and Chinese food.  Both are super delicious and have never disappointed.  When we don't feel like eating Mongolian BBQ we opt for their Chinese food which is made fresh to order. Mongolian Beef is so nice and tender, love all the green onions they add to it.< /review>

<review>Although the food is tasty. The signs are very misleading!! They tell you one bowl for $7.99 then they charge you for an extra bowl for the noodles. My husband and I ate here & we each got one bowl but we were charged an all-you-can-eat price! I thought the noodles and the vegetables & meat and sauces were all included in that price but apparently not. Just be aware that you will be charged extra for the noodles!!
We got two bowls and Ice Tea & it  was $30!!
Unfortunately We won't be back!!< /review>< Time>

I really like this place because I sometimes come here but with this experience I will be rethinking on coming again, it took a while for them to fix me order after I told them they did something wrong and the cashier lady looked angry at me like if messed it up.

Clean, readonly priced and plenty of fresh toppings. What's really nice is that they don't have a few meats to add, they have several! Lamb, Turkey, Chicken, Pork, Crab, and Beef! That's a solid offering not to mention tons of veggies and sauces for toppings. The staff has been very friendly each time I've visited and the food is always good. Sure smokes the Mongolian BBQ places in the malls, that's for sure!<//Review>

Come here for lunch all the time. Staff is friendly and attentive, but hard to understand. The Mongolian BBQ is great. Lunch special price is great. When it's busy, you can go on both sides of the food area. They have menu items too but it's basic Chinese food and pretty low quality.<//review>

Mongolian BBQ Moreno valley is a good place to enjoy the Mongol bbq when you have that taste desire.  Good selection and they do a nice job cooking.  Just a nice place to eat.</review>

<Review>WARNING!!!!!!! This place is terrible! I paid $30 dollars for rock hard, flavorless food! I will never eat here again. The food was by no means worth $30 dollars. The idiots combined my plate with another, which really screwed up my mix. DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY!!!! The employees hardly speak english, which only made the communication that much more difficult, after I did my best to be kind regarding the terrible, rock hard food and poor service!!!!!!!!! DO NOT DINE HERE!!!!!!!< /Review>< Date>

<Text>The worst customer service.  This place would be great if the "manager" learned how to provide proper customer service. This woman who claims to be the manager was extremely rude . She brought the wrong order out and when we asked for utencils and napkins she proceeded to point to where the napkins and utencils were. She never brought them I had to get up and get them myself. Mind you there were no other people there. When it came time to pay i  asked for a box she compleately ignored me.  I had to ask another man if he could get me a box. Then when I asked how much she pointed to the register. Idk what her issue was but if she hates attending to customers she is in the wrong business.< /Text>< user_name>

<Review>Mass array of vegetables, proteins, and sauces. If you are not wanting the bbq, they have many other options such as soup, chicken, etc. End it with an assortment of desserts there is jello, cream puffs, etc. A very welcoming presence that invites you in.< /Review>< UserId.>

I was there today for the 1st time.
For those that haven't had Mongolian BBQ yet It's just like Hitachi you choose your type of meat your veggies,spices add ons(onions,pepers,cilantro,scallions,jalapenos etc....)And than your sauces of preference. It can be hot or not+noddles.They have egg holls or dumplings as appetizers if you prefer you can choose (all ypu can eat or a box.(mixed up all ingredients u choose in one box.
Its Absolutely delicious.
They have Fountain drinks and a fe variety of ice tea and supposedly Peak ice tea.That is the only reason why they will Not get 5 stars from me bcz there was np other flavor of peak ice tea avalaible then raspberry ,sweet tea and unsweetened was all water.
Butthe place was clean prices wete reasonable .Good customer service.
I recomend.</review>

This restaurant is surprisingly healthy and tasty!  The way it works is that you get a bowl or two and fill it with veggies, frozen strips of meat and you get a bowl of egg drop soup, rice and bread.  Of course you can go low carb and ditch the rice, bread and noodles and getting only veggies and meat which makes it pretty tasty.  You can buy the all you can eat deal and go back for as many helpings as you'd like.  Part of me is kinda put off because the veggies seem to be canned and the meat is obviously frozen so there's no way to really know the quality of the food you're eating.</Text>

<pictures>None</pictures><text>The food is great, the place is clean, and the workers are nice. However recently their was a very nice man who worked their who did a spectacular job waiting me and my family, we gave him a $5 dollar tip and he looked at us with fear in his eyes and said "is she looking". An Asian woman, the manager perhaps, was observing the man cruely. When we went outside we noticed the woman yelling at him as he cleaned where we ate and where others ate as well. Eventually we watched the woman snatch the tip we gave out of his pocket (she put his hands on him obviously). I've never seen such a cruel person in the work place, and the act of placing her hands on him is illegal I'm pretty sure. My mom and dad ran in to confront her with no luck of changing her perspective, something must be done about this woman. Other the place is nice.<//text></record>

horrible horrible service. Food is great and all, but when we asked for an interview for my class project they were so rude about it, I understand it’s their right to say no, but they were very rude about it. They also were giving my friends and I cruel stares and looks when we tried to talk to their cooks to get their perspective on the restaurant, something must be done the women and man are very rude.< /review>

Though the $10.95 special does come out to around $12.00 after taxes are put on this is still a fiarly good deal. Make sure you grab more than one bowl to split up your ingrediants as there is not a maximum bowl amount that the staff will mix. Make sure to put plenty of sauces in it to give the BBQ some extra taste. The hot sauce will definitely kick it up a  notch.

The desert table leaves a bit to be desired but the cake was surprisingly good.</review>

Bad customer service !
Lady does not understand English and served us eggrolls to substitute egg soup but never said she was going to charge us. She did not want to take it off bill.  Bad experience.<//text>

Very bad service I asked the server a questions about the pricing because it is very misleading and she basically handed me the paper menu and told me to figure it out then I asked her again to explain a and she pointed to the paper and said look. Very rude not how people should be treated when eating at THEIR restaurant.< /review>

<text>Great price for what you get for. Starts getting busy around 6:30 for dinner. You got alot of choices in meats (chicken, beef, turkey, lamb, imitation crab, and pork). Not the prettiest place but the food speaks for itself for $8.99 not including tax and tip.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

I went there for the first time today because I was curious about trying Mongolian beef and I'm glad this was the place I went to. You get to fill up a bowl with whatever you want and as much as u want. I had trouble with mine as I didn't know you could seriously put a bunch of food in it and the man there helped me...he added more chowmein and filled it with sauces.....it was very delicious....very friendly staff too.....go to this place, like SERIOUSLY!!<//review>

It's a great price, but the food itself is ok, not great.  I prefer the Mongolian BBQ place near UCR off university street.  It's a little bit more expensive but definitely worth the price because the quality and taste is exceptional.</text>

<text>(Translated by Google) The food is good, the bad thing is the Chinese lady who charges is looking at what you do and it seems that she is always angry she does not have good customer service I do not know how to speak English my Spanish I think I am afraid to go to school to learn the Chinese language ... .

(Original)

<Rating>4<//Rating><Review>(Translated by Google) Mongolian rotisserie with great weight for Taiwanese
Also a bit of a table meal
The taste is very salty and oily
Occasionally gathering with friends is suitable for 啰
a little bit accustomed to people 🙋

(Original)
對台灣人來說份量極大的蒙古烤肉店
也有點餐方式的桌菜
口味很鹹很油
偶爾跟朋友聚聚適合囉
稍微有點吃不慣的人🙋<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>Told me I need a new tire, that my tire could NOT be fixed, got a second opinion... totally could be fixed... "Big O Tire" is fixing it for $29.99 verses $222 for a new one.

Below quote is up in thier office:

"I believe fundamental honesty is the keystone of business." -Harvey S. Firestone

So much for that with this location.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGrtH1nlji7rwb9JuS4ijTQRs-c7abRgxCsYdl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgkwAi0kpXQo3oost8qMAE_pqq2uSZUQ4f_Yju=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>{'time': 1619652967166, 'text': "Mihaela, thank you for sharing this feedback with us.

< review>
I recently had problem with my car. So i took it to the dealer and they gave me a estimation of $700 something. So I went to Firestone to get a second opinion to compare the pricing on my repairs.  Frank at Firestone was honest and only charged me to fix the things I needed. And the price of repair was much better than what dealer estimated for.
Thank you Frank you are the best. I saved almost $500. And didn't have to fix the things that wasn't necessary.</review>

On 11/3/20, I came to this shop when my Chevy sensor alerted to low air in my front left tire. Felix checked all my air pressure and realized it was actually my left rear tire due to a nail. He was very professional and filled all my tires with air for free. I appreciated his help and professionalism.</review>

Set an appointment for 1:30 today. I arrived on time and was told I would have a2 hour wait. I had asked for a 3:30 appointment and was told the only appointment they had available was 1:30. Two hours from 1:30 is 3:30! The time I requested.
I was asked make, model and year of my car and was quoted a price for service. When I arrived the price was $50. more than the quote. These guys have no idea what they are doing.
Needless to say I’m taking my car to someone competent</Text>

This used to be such a wonderful place to bring your car when Greg was the store manager!!!! I have recommended many friends to bring their cars here.  I have been coming here for almost 10 years. Unfortunately, that is not true anymore. During my last oil service, I was told that I may need to have my brake pads/rotors changed. I was hesitant, I wanted the dealer to do it. I did not want to get cheap and low-quality brakes that squeak. However, they pushed on with what a great deal I can get for $300. So I got the new brakes and they got my money. Now, the new brakes squeak every time I brake. I brought the car back but they could not find/fix the problem. The management is completely new; the store and service managers do not care. I wish I did not listen to their promises and sales pitch. I will be looking for another place to service my cars.< /Text>

One thing I like about this place e is honesty and service. I made an appointment to change my two tires at front and to check the breaks. After installing tires n checking breaks, they told me I didn't need new breaks yet but other few things. Manager Janet was nice and only thing is the new tires were not rotated.</review>

I’ve made appointment at 3:00 for changing oil, they told requirements time 1 hour for changing oil, but when I’ve came they told that waiting time 2 hours, because technical is busy right now. So I’ve left and changed oil in valvonline in 35 min without appointment. I just don’t understand why to schedule a appoint if your specialists could be busy at the appointed time. what is the reason in appointment ?<//review>

<review>I just love this place. Above I really like Greg, he helped me many times in the past several years. He is the most important reason I keep coming back. I have been taking here all of my cars over the last 5+ years. I am a loyal and very satisfied customer. If you have any problems with your car, this is the place to take it....ask for Greg. He is an honest guy.<//review>< Date>

<review>I've been coming here for around 6 or 7 years. I live closer to a different Firestone but choose to go out of my way because of how honest they are. I never get the sense that I'm being pressured into getting unnecessary work done, and their prices are very reasonable. I recently took my car to the dealership for an airbag recall, and in the process they inspected my car. They quoted me at $1k for some minor work, and when I went to Firestone my bill came to $280. As long as I live here, and as long as the service remains excellent, I will always continue to come here.<//review><time>1530297390993</time><gmap_id>0x80dcd50f2ccb65ab:0x3214ce691d4e88</gmap_id><Rate>5< /Rate>< pictures>

Sorry no 0 STARS to choose..

i stopped by Firestone Brea today to check my brakes as they were making noise when i brake..
Got a call few hours later that they had to fix lot of stuff and it costs $900+..
OK i said i don't want to spend too much money on that car  and i will pick up my car because its an old car and not worth more than 2k ..
VERY SURPRISED TO HEAR WHAT THEY SAID - They said they had to do something as part of brake inspection and had to break something and the car is not drivable anymore and i have to tow my car if i don't want to fix the car.. As a customer i expected to hear an estimate for the repair and then decide whether to fix or not

I DON'T WANT TO WRITE ANYMORE ABOUT THESE GUYS..
ALL I CAN SAY IS I HAD RESPECT FOR FIRESTONE AND WAS A CUSTOMER FOR MANY YEARS AND THEY LOST IT...........<//review>

<review>My family has been bringing their cars here for over 20 years and NEVER had a negative experience. However when management changed over recently the quality of customer service went down the tubes with it. I regretfully brought my car in for a simple service and when it was returned to me my brake lights weren’t working. I called to let them know and instead of being receptive and wanting to help and fix the problem I was spoken to in a condescending tone and treated like a four-year-old who knows nothing.  I will never trust this particular shop or the firestone franchise ever again.  And what a shame to  because not only will myself and the other six members of my family not be returning to get our service done at firestone Brea, but I’ll also make sure to spread the word throughout North Orange county where I teach 12 fitness classes a week and come into contact with hundreds of people. I’ll be recommending other places where I’ve had better service and customer care.<//review><time>1565805567023<//time>< Pics>

Top notch information about the required service which includes showing you what you need on the vehicle. On-time service and repair and service with your vehicle returned clean. All auto service is pricey but at least here it is in the neighborhood and you can call for assistance anytime and your vehicle is finished in the time estimate given. My phone messages are always returned in a timely manner also. A very good shop.<//Review>

<Time>1448320021816< /Time><text>The place is a little hard to get into simply because of its awkward location. Went here for an alignment. Took longer than stated. When they were done with the alignment, turns out they did almost nothing because my rear wheels were not adjustable (did not know), and front two were mostly balanced in the first place. I understand this is the policy but I personally think it's unfair I had to pay full price for a complete alignment when they only serviced two wheels. Otherwise, staff was helpful.</text>< rating>

<name>PC SERVICES< /name><Date>1472618159677</Date><Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Thee BEST deal on tires in Brea !

I've worked in the tire sales industry for many years, retired now.

If you have shopped for tires then you are familiar with the generic phone-service attitude talking as they have been trained off the new employee manual in how-to-handle phone sales, kinda makes me laugh.

It was nice to speak with the guys at Firestone who really communicated like real persons off the cuff.

Back to the tire deal, I shopped 8 area automotive centers that sold tires, FIRESTONE had them all beat by $7.00 on the phone. When I showed up to actually purchase they gave me a better deal which ended up beating out other quotes by $12.00 !

So this is my experience check them out hopefully they will be able to provide you with a great deal and excellent service when your vehicle needs it.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

I went there for my 2012 Toyota Camry break and they give me an estimate of $900 for both front and rear break pads, rear rotter and front two tires. I put new tires 7000 miles ago in Sam's club. I got my car back without fixing any of their suggestions. Next day went to Sam's club and they told me tires are good only need rotation. This is my first time changing breaks. Only rear pads need to be replaced. Front were 25% left but Firestone wants to change everything. Watch out for these guys. Always take second opinion if estimate is more than $100 unless you have extra money to pay to crooks.</text>

I'm not going to spend a lot of time writing a "review" because I am writing their  corporate office as well but, I can say that I felt extremely  discriminated against. I was a loyal customer and to be treated with such disrespect is disgusting. I will leave the details for the letter that I am sending to their corporate office. My main point is to avoid going to this location! Ryan is a top notch jerk, who definitely needs to be retrained. He is under qualified and has a bad attitude for the comany. It definitely looks bad on the management as well.</Review>

I went to the place a couple months ago. I spent over 1500 to get my car fixed to be able to pass a smog test, fix my squeaking wheels and get tires and to also fix a problem with my key sticking in the ignition.
I left with some leaks and rattling, and still have a check engine light on. I talked to customer support and they said I would be in contact with a regional manager, someone who can help me get my money back since I'm extremely disappointed but I have only been contacted by a store manager who said they don't do refunds after a month.

The report they gave me was bare bones and the explanation of care sections were completely empty.  They also new that 2 of my tires were new but decided to replace all 4 tires regardless. This is not right, a customer who is spending a lot of money and trust should leave with the utmost confidence in a mechanics ability to do their jobs and now I'm here 3 months later with a huge bill and a car that is still not able to be registered.
You should take your business elsewhere to people who you can trust< /text>

Don't bother making a reservation. After bringing it in for a 9am reservation, it wasn't looked at until close to 4. All they did was look up the Check Engine light codes...which I had already done beforehand...and basically told me they couldn't fix it after waiting the whole day. Why couldn't have said that at 9am when I told them the codes myself. A day wasted and now the repair has to wait another week.</text>

< Review>
I took my Honda Accord for a simple rear break change on a Friday because I was taking the my kids and my wife on a trip to Vegas for some Hiking fun. It took them the whole day to perform the repairs. Finally around 4pm they called me to let me know my car was ready. I picked up my car and returned back to work witch is about 1mile away from Firestone Auto Care. As soon as I parked I engaged my emergency break and noticed that it was not working, I immediately took the car back to the shop and in about 30min they had the issue fixed witch was fine but I left to Vegas with a doubt that the breaks would work. On my way back from Vegas I stopped at a gas station to check on my tires air pressure and noticed that one of my back tires did required some air. when I went to try and put air on it the tire valve had been pinched with the tires wheel cover and there was no way to get it out but to take all the nuts out pop the tire wheel cover and fixed the pinched valve. What should have been a simple regular break maintenance turned into a stress worried that my breaks would fail.</Review>

<username>Jason Bartosh</username><Date>1379027759181<//Date><review>I have 4 cars with lifetime alignment, and have spent over $8-9k there in the last 2 years for shocks, tires, tune ups, and all maintenance of my cars and my kids cars. Recently I brought my truck in right before a trip to Vegas because it was shaking. It wasn't alignment, so they checked the brakes, wasn't it either. They noticed a nail in my tire. Called me and told me it'd be $20 to pull out...my son mentioned that America's tire will do it for free. I asked him if he could pull it out complimentary because of my service history with them.
His reply "we already did a complimentary brake inspection to look deeper into the shaking, if I do the nail for free, where does it end?"
It ends with me recommending people there and spending thousands to have them service my vehicles. It ends with them being petty after I've trusted them to recommend work being done to my vehicles.< /review></record>

Every time I stop by, seem like they're always in a bad mood. No customer service at all.  Last time I was there, the guy told me, maybe I should stop smoking! I'm thinking to myself, if you say that to everyone, you won't be in business for long.</Text>

Good parking with wheelchair accessibility to The Shop. They carry all of the newest toys and accessories for today's adults enjoyments and experimenting. Helpfull, friendly and very in the know about today's adult toys, games and personal enjoyment paraphernalia. Prices a little higher than elsewhere but worth paying for the knowledgeable employees and the higher quality merchandise. Stop and check it out, You'll be glad You did. Take your spouse, friends or just go by yourself. You'll be glad you did. Sodas, juices and chips, chocolate and other candys to help with the munchies while you browse and buy. 🎶😎🎶<//Text>

So over priced it's insane people who shop here regularly must be mentally challenged to give away there money like that. Will never spend a single cent at this place.</Review>

Ridiculously over priced, the guy was so rude, he was taking the price tags off as we were asking about prices and telling us way higher prices, I usually go to the smoke shop on First and Gettysburg, the guy at this place charges literally twice as much for the same vape juice, don't shop here unless you like getting ripped off.< /Text>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>Called in orders for sandwiches multiple times and they are never ready for pickup.

The second time we waited until 10 minutes after they were supposed to be ready to pick them up and they started making them after we arrived at the counter.

The third time we gave them an extra 20 minutes,still they werent ready when we arrived.

The service is terrible and slow. They are always out of a good portion of the menu.

Do yourself a favor and skip this location.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Easily the worst subway I've ever been to. Slow service, argumentative employees (shift lead is the epitome of someone who hates his job). I was stoked when they put in a Subway near Wildwood but this one is trash. Doesn't even deserve one star.<//text>

Went to try PV subway for the first time last night at 6:56pm. The young girl said I can't make you food. I have bread to put away and stuff. Hours posted  are open until 8pm. She said she won't get paid after 8pm and had to finish closing routine. If you don't serve food before 7pm your sign should not say open until 8pm. Won't be back.<//review>

Always out of half of their meat and bread no matter if you come first thing or in the afternoon have been twice and they had no pepperoni or turkey or white bread.... for a place not frequently trafficked it’s pretty bad for them to always be out of stuff.< /text>

So I continue driving there and when I get there they hand me a bag of cold bacon and a tub of sauce. Thats it, no new sandwich no sorry for the inconvenience just cold bacon. Honestly I laughed for a couple minutes in the parking lot because I thought it was a joke and a camera crew would run out laughing but nope just let down by subway once again, but its the last time since I'm never returning.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x809b662445b155d7:0xe03f41ed62ec6777<//Gmap_id></record>

Terrible service, extremely unprofessional. The 3 girls that were working were talking bad on there coworkers the whole time and one had her shirt tied above her belly button so her whole stomach and back was showing, she removed and put her ask back on multiple times while making the sandwiches, also very rude and disrespectful to the customer's. Not to mention, waited 20 minutes for 3 sandwiches because they were to busy talking to eachother about the other workers that were supposed to come in.</text>

It's a normal subway, however they are often understaffed and the staff that is there is fairly slow, which leads to a bit of a wait. Do yourself a favor and order online.<//review>

<Review>Arnold was amazing!!!  Totally satisfied!  My car battery died, he was here in 15 minutes and took the time to explain to me what happened and why!  Then he gave me a new battery on the spot for almost $50 less than the Honda dealership!!  Amazing service.   Highly recommended!!!<//Review>< Pictures>

It was about midnight around Jan 14, 2021 when I called AAA because my alternator went out on the 5 fwy Joe from California coach towing, came to the rescue and towed my vehicle 15 miles to my destination. Joe was very professional and overall an amazing person! Thank you very much Joe for your help.<//Text>

The driver of a tow truck with this business name and address just cut me off on the road, he was driving recklessly and endangering people around him. If this is how they drive their tow truck imagine how they’ll treat your car, use ANY OTHER place. Trust me this shows just how little they care about others and the service they provide, you would think that a tow truck driver would know how to drive safely but they don’t.  If this is your business you should retrain your drivers to learn to drive on the road and to take care of your trucks when they’re on the road and also to not drag your business’s name trough the mud because this puts your name in a bad light.<//review>

I just had a really wonderful experience with California Coach towing with Santino (hope I didn’t misspell that bc he’s one fine human being. The way men should be. Honest , reliable , and you can tell he takes pride in himself and his job. It was almost midnight when AAA roadside assistance called him up to give me a tow after my car had problems and had to pull off the freeway. I thought I would have to wait for hours but he was faster than the representative at AAA said he’d be. Cars safe and at home as am I. Very grateful for him. Hope he gets a raise lol. Wishing you guys the best and a safe journey back to LA.< /Review>

<Text>I just got my vehicle back from Coach Collision and they did an excellent job with the repairs and service. They even fixed an issue from a previous repair ( not done by Collision Coach) that was not part of the original repair order just because it was something they could fix easily and found that it had not been done fully correct. They did not charge for the extra repair and they returned my vehicle fully cleaned and detailed. I could not be happier with the customer service and attention to details. I would highly recommend them for any collision repairs to your vehicle.</Text></record></dataset><record>

This towing service was through AAA.  Luis Martin is very courteous and efficient.  He arrived on time and handled the car fast & professionally on pick-up and drop off manifesting their experience in towing. The tow truck used is powerful, well equipped and handled with ease the loading and unloading.<//review>

These guys are fantastic! They are very professional, polite, and took the time to inspect my car before repairs and explain everything that they were looking for, as far as damage to my rear bumper and any possible damage to the undercarriage. They communicate very well and worked flawlessly with my insurance. When I picked up my car they had cleaned and polished not only the repaired bumper, but the entire car and the inside as well. My car looks absolutely perfect! I will definitely be returning here for any future body work, and will be referring my friends and family as well.</text>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>FIVE STARS!

After my car stalled in the middle of a freeway exit on 9/14, Alex B. quickly and safely got my car off the road. He made sure my sisters and I were okay and talked me through the towing process from beginning to end. He was very kind, funny, and helpful. I've never had a more positive experience with a tow company.

Thank you!!!

<date>1572502746591< /date><Text>what I thought was a simple trip to Frank & sons on San Jose road turned out to be a fiasco but thanks to  Adoney and all the people at California coach the night wasn't a total loss. I locked my keys in the trunk of my BMW because I was in a hurry so I called AAA and they sent out California Coach the gentleman Adoney was dispatched to my location when he  got there he was in my car within minutes but the problem was getting into the trunk. All I can say is that it's a pain in the @#$ to get into the trunk of a BMW. But thanks to him and his coworker Ivan and their patience and perseverance we were in. I just want to personally thank them for their help and I will always highly recommend you guys while I'm in that area if I ever need a tow truck so I give him five stars across the. the</Text></record></dataset><record>

2Hrs waiting for the tow truck on the side of 60FWY. No calls or messages that the guy will be late. From 8pm to 10pm. I called AAA they said another 20min. This California Coach is in Walnut 15 min away the traffic is running at 80mi/hr. I called California Coach the girl that answered said there is too much traffic. I am laughing how idiotic. AAA is not doing its job by checking the complaints from other members.</Text>

<text>The people are rude and have no sense of hospitality at their office. Their tow truck drove through my mobile home park at 25 mph when there's kids playing and the park clearly states 10 mph.

<Review>Their driver Alex is extremely rude. I have AAA which is an amazing company and he got the call to come out to tow my vehicle. I got in a car accident this morning in which the other vehicle hit my bumper. The brackets are broken and I don’t want to drive my car home because I don’t want to take the chance of my bumper falling off on the freeway. This tow truck driver Alex is just standing there looking at my car up and down and says there’s no damage and that he’s not towing my car. What is that all about? and the whole time he was with a bad attitude and speaking rudely to me. What did I do to him? .. It’s not my fault that he can’t see the damage which by the way is none of his business. He was called to tow my car and thats that. Ask me for my membership card and my DL and that’s it. The only good comments I’ll leave is that the manager of this place was kind to take down my complaint and my call. The dispatcher was nice too. But Alex, worst tow truck driver bad attitude ever. Epic fail.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>My car broke down today in Walnut at the shopping center with my little niece in the car. I called Auto Club and they sent Antonio from California Coach Towing to get the car and take it to my mechanic.  It was so hot (90) and Antonio got me and my niece safely home and took my car to the mechanic.  I have to say he was so wonderful, fast service, so polite, what a great person and employee!

Thanks for the great service!</text><Time>1368581025694< /Time><name>Stephanie Hart<//name>< gmap_id>

And with all the delays in packaging lately, I was pleasantly surprised that my skincare products arrived on time, as promised. Highly recommend this company for online purchases.</review>< Pics>

I ordered my favorite ZO product, Exfoliating Polish from Skincare Market. This product is the best at keeping skin smooth and radiant. After my online order was placed I received the product very quickly. I am impressed with the quick service and will use Skincare Market again in the future.<//review>

<text>I was turned on to Skin Ceuticals products over 10 years ago by a professional and it has made a huge difference in my skin. The product I love the most is the C E Ferulic. I buy the professional size and save in the long run. I am 73 and I don't look it. FABULOUS! Start as young as you can. I till make a huge difference.< /text>< pictures>

<user_name>Beverly L Trujillo< /user_name><text>I am 69 years old and have been using Dermal Repair Cream for several years.  Everyone thinks I'm in my late 40's or early 50's.  I use it every night and every morning without fail.  It keeps wrinkles at bay and my skin is dewy so that my makeup goes on beautifully.  It's better than any other cream I've tried and I'm so glad to find it on Skincare Market at this great price with free shipping.</text><Rating>5< /Rating>< date>

<review>I have been buying products from Skincare Market for quite a while and have come to know them as an extremely reputable company selling brand new products and not counterfeit products, which is something that is very important to me. Each product arrives in a brand new box/totally sealed, and this way I know I’m getting the manufacturers product from Skincare Market.

Good user friendly website.  Best prices on SPF especially compared to a dermatology office.  Very securely packaged.  Arrived on time.  I like the fact that they have a phone number posted so it is easy to get in touch, if necessary.  All in all well managed business!<//text>

My dermatologist gave me a sample of the EltaMD UV Elements Broad Spectrum SPF 44 and I really liked it. It is lightly tinted which is awesome! It's light and easy to apply. It works well under foundation too.  My order came quickly and I was impressed with Skincare Market.</Text>

<Text>Fast shipping and items were always well packed. Hydrating B5 gel is very good for my dry skin. I could feel it absorbed right into my skin as soon as I applied it.

<Text>I placed my first order from Skincare Market, Inc on Dec.20, and received it today, Dec. 24!! I was very surprised and happy to receive this so quickly! The prices on this quality product were better than any other source, so  I placed this order. I am in NY state and expected to see it perhaps later in December, since its a busy month for mail and packages. I even received samples of high quality products to try! I will be using Skincare Market again for future orders!!<//Text>< Pics>

Review of Skincare Market Inc.: I purchased a bottle of SkinCeuticals Serum 10 AOX  in November and didn't get around to using it until January or February.  It was in original packaging and when I opened it the color was a very pale yellow.  I mention the color because the longer you use it the color deepens due to oxidation which tells me it was an authentic product.  Skincare Market provided a quality product at one of the best price points I've seen for this particular item.< /Text>

This was my first time ordering from Skincare Market.  Everything went pretty smoothly.  When I ordered the product, it was noted that the product would be shipped for a 4 or 5 day delivery.  It took 6 days, but that was not a problem, as I still had product remaining.  The pricing was very competitive and it arrived in new, unopened packaging.  Next time I am in need of this product, I will check with Skincare Market, before purchasing.</Text>

What an excellent discount high-end skincare store.  Skincare Market offers samples for purchase - which allows me to use expensive lines in an affordable way.  All of their products are high end.  They have great customer service and I usually get my orders in 1-2 days.  Also, they allow discount codes for an extra little percentage off of the total.  I am a continuing customer with no intention of changing vendors.  Skincare Market is great!<//review>

E-shopping definitely has it advantages.  Certainly not like going to four supermarkets to find a food product that you need to complete a meal.  I decided to do a web search for my favorite Dermalogica Active Moist product and found it on Skincare Market.  The 3.4 ounce was offered for a great price - - less than I would have paid in any mall store.  I have found my new 'go-to' for my face products.<//text>

I’ve been ordering Skinmedica products through Skincare Market for well over 3 years. The convenience and ease are great but the best is their discounted pricing. I am so tired of playing games with the local businesses that run sales for very limited time or at events you have to attend. I would always discover I needed to replenish a week before or a week after their sales. My time is valuable so I would rather do business with a company who respects that.
The extra 5%, rewards, product samples or gifts, and free shipping, are nice perks that make you feel appreciated.</Text>

I LOVE Skin Medica TNS Serum.  I can not find it at a better price than Skincare Market.  And all their products are 100% authentic.  I have been burned before by ordering expensive skincare and finding out it is counterfeit.  Not here!  Great customer service, quick free shipping and they often include free samples!

<Review>E-shopping definitely has it advantages.  Certainly not like going to four supermarkets to find a food product that you need to complete a meal.  I decided to do a web search for my favorite Dermalogica Active Moist product and found it on Skincare Market.  The 3.4 ounce was offered for a great price - - less than I would have paid in any mall store.  I have found my new 'go-to' for my face products.< /Review>< date>

I purchased IMAGE Skincare Prevention+ Daily Ultimate Protection Moisturizer SPF 50 and I love it. I have purchased this product for years and will continue to do so. My skin is very well protected with SPF 50+ so when I am out in the elements I do not have any concerns of damage and it has a very mild scent to it that smells pretty good. I highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for excellent skin protection.</Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Skincare Market Inc. Is the place to go for all your skincare needs. Not sure what you need? Their customers service team is an excellent place to start. The delivery was fast and secure! Most of all, is getting your skincare to start using so you can get back to self care! You can't go wrong with this company! You often get special discounts and free samples!! I love this place!!</Review>< UserId.>

I am an African American who suffers from acne and blemishes and hyperpigmentation. I came across these products by an African American Dermatologist and said well since she suffered from the same thing and these products helped in doing wonders for her, let me try it out. I have only been using these products for a short while, however, I must say that I am thoroughly enjoying them so far. So I am giving these products a month to see what results I get and so far I'm pleased with my purchase! Looking forward to better skin journey with them!!< /text>

<Text>I have been buying products from Skincare Market for many years. In particular, I buy an EltaMD face lotion, which was recommended by my dermatologist.  What I appreciate about Skincare Market is that the lotion is better priced than other places I have looked, especially when I wait until they offer a special discount. Those discounts appear frequently. Finally, the product typically arrives within five days of my order.  I don't recall ever wondering when it will arrive.</Text>< pictures>

<review>Ordering from Skincare Market proved to be a very pleasant and easy first experience. I have always gotten my Dermalogica products from the salon that I have my facials at, however since the pandemic there has been no facial activity to be enjoyed.I will order again. Great communication and delivery.<//review>< Pics>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>I absolutely LOVE Skincare Market! They are my #1 go to for all my skincare products. (I use Image and can not find them in stores and their website prices a MUCH higher) Not only do they have fantastic prices on all of the products and fast shipping, the customer service is one of the best I’ve ever experienced for an online shopping company. While I order on a regular basis, one time the specific cleanser was sold out after I put it in my cart and purchased. A customer service rep (I *think* his name was Jason) personally called me to inform me of the delay on the product, refunded me shipping and sent item right when they got it back in stock. Again, I HIGHLY recommend ordering from Skincare Market!</Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

I purchased the EltaMD UV Clear Tinted SPF 46 because of how TikTok dermatologists praised it. I absolutely love it! Firstly, the product was shipped almost immediately, and it came on time. I am a black woman, about Beyonce's complexion, and this product works perfectly for me. I had no ABSOLUTELY no grey casts. My skin was not oily ANY at all. It rubbed in my skin very quickly and easily. I live in Jamaica, where its very humid, and I wear heavy makeup - this sunscreen has not affected the look of my makeup in any way. This has become a staple in my everyday life. Will purchase again.</Text>

I use image skin care. I order from this company because they are responsive, reliable, and my products are always fresh and well packaged. Their customer service reps are friendly and helpful. Their pricing is also amazing! If I were to buy the same products in Canada from a distributor, I would pay double. Shipping wait time is worth it! Usually takes around 5 days to arrive at my door :)< /text>

< Review>
I have been using Skincare Market for several years now.  I have never been disappointed. The main reason was I could get my very expensive products for a reduced price.  The products are the same quality and quantity you would by at a retail store or doctor’s office.  The prices are sometimes greatly reduced.  And the samples received have sometimes impressed me enough to add to my routine.  Very satisfied.</Review>

I am always unsure about ordering from sites I haven’t heard of, even if their reviews are good.  So glad I found Skincare Market!  They had a better price than other sites which is why I chose them.  And my items shipped within a couple of hours of being ordered.  Who could ask for more!  Good prices AND good customer service!  Glad I took a chance on them.  I will be a repeat customer for sure.<//Text>

<review>Skincare Market has the best prices for all of your skincare needs!  I've been searching for a more cost-effective way to continue using my favorite products, and I happened across Skincare Market on a google search, and I am a new convert. Fast Shipping, and I feel better than I'm supporting a small business. I'm looking forward to all of my future purchases.
And I'm referring skincaremarket.net  to all of my friends.<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>I love Skincare Market! I always research when I need to purchase my expensive skin care products and Skincare Market by far has the best prices of any other company. I know I can trust Skincare Market not to sell me a counterfeit product like I think Amazon does. I ordered my favorite SkinMedica HA5 product and couldn’t believe how fast it arrived. The customer service is fantastic so be sure and give Skincare Market a try, you definitely won’t be sorry!

Reliability, price, and top product choices keep me shopping at Skincare Market. Living at high altitude in sunny Colorado, Elta MD has been our “Go To” facial sunscreen line for years. The order process makes it so easy to keep stocked up.<//text>

Skincare Market has been the online resource for my beauty needs for years.   They have very competitive prices off of retail cost,  offer sales,  as well discounts.  Most recently my purchases have been IS Clinical & SkinMedica products.  Customer service from the owner was excellent.   Products were delivered within a few days of ordering & the items (glass) were carefully packaged.   A few free samples were also included with my order.<//Text>

Genuine product, used skin medica Ha5 2oz.
Fully packaged and matches product from Md office. Had an experience with a “fake” look alike from another website in the past, but skincare market was original. Very fast service. Love the occasional extra coupons, makes product use more reasonable.<//Review>

My skin has never looked better! I was a few days of being out of Revision Skincare Brightening Facial Wash. I ordered on a Friday and and my order was shipped very quickly, I received it by Tuesday. The product cost less from here than anywhere else I had looked to buy. I will be ordering from here again!< /text>

I purchased the eltaMD UV Shield SPF and totally love it! This mineral SPF is non-greasy and absorbs quickly, which is great for my oily skin. The package arrived quickly. I'll definitely order from Skincare Market again!</text>

Excellent product for continued healthy skin. The product needs only a small amount for each wash and the bottle lasts a long time. Never ever dries out my skin. Have been a faithful user of the Cleansing Complex for many years. Gotta go order more since I am almost out!</Review>

I was looking for a product from Avene and stumbled across Skincare Market Inc. and wow! Their prices are just about unbeatable! Website is super easy to manage and they not only have a ton of products to choose from but some tools to use as well. This is my new go-to skincare place! You simply must try<//review>

I have found the best prices for guaranteed products on this site and have been ordering from them for more than 5 years. Products arrive on time and as advertised. One time I received an Image The Max product that had an expired date. I contacted them and once verified, they replaced it immediately. I prefer to pay a little more for guaranteed products than order online from somewhere such as Walmart where I'm not sure if the products are authentic.< /Review>

Ordered 2 items from this company. They only sent one of them and said they will issue a credit. They never did and I called 3-4 time and left a message but never received a response. When I disputed the item with the credit card company they showed that they sent the one item but did not show that it was not complete.  Order from this company to get ripped off<//Text>

They seem to always have a discount available, which is nice.  They have good prices, but product availability is hit or miss.  I was pretty disappointed when I realized they charged me the Los Angeles County sales tax rate when I live in Orange County where it is lower.  I wonder what they're doing with the extra tax they are collecting?</Text>

I placed my first order with Skincare Market and I am very pleased. The items were 25% less than retail, my order was delivered within four days, and the website was very easy to use. The items were packed well and there is no question that I will purchase from them again in the future. Very pleased, thanks for excellent service!</text>

I buy my products in one place, Skincare Market! I always get the best price on the market and the customer service/shipping experience has been great. I highly recommend purchasing all your skincare needs via Skincare Market. I wish they would widen their brand scope, but the options are solid.<//text>

I highly recommend Skincare Market!!  I purchased their Dermalogica Multi-Active Toner and received exceptional service.  First, I have separate physical and billing addresses and for security purposes, a Skincare Market representative called me within just a few hours of placing the order to confirm which address I wanted my product mailed to.  Second, I received my product in the mail within 72 hours, very neatly and securely wrapped with no damage to the bottle.  Finally, I had checked everywhere, both in-store and online, and found SkinCare Market had the lowest price for this Dermalogica product.  With Skincare Market providing both the lowest price as well as exceptional service, I will definitely be purchasing from this company again!<//Text>

I have ordered from Skincare Market several times, and it is actually a hidden GEM! I have received every order, items were authentic, and shipping did NOT take long. Prices are great and they typically have 5% off discounts on top of item! I am very satisfied and WILL order from again!</Review>

<Text>I've ordered twice now from Skin Market. I get name brand products at a great discounted price and free delivery with only a $30 purchase. Delivery tracking was updated and products arrived in previously stated time frame.
Love that I can afford products I love. They also offer promo codes which further lowers the price of an order.</Text><UserId.>102596281278724813145<//UserId.><username>Genevieve OBrien<//username><Date>1596498414523< /Date><rating>5< /rating>< pictures>

I’ve been buying from Skincare Market for several years. Last product that I’ve got was PCA skin sunscreen and it came in time, perfectly packed and wrapped. Love to work with them and surly will recommend to my friends.
Oh, and off course their prices and promotions won’t leave you disappointed.<//text>

I have been using PCA Skin Intensive Brightening Treatment 0.5% Pure Retinol Night for about 3 months now! I liked how my skin did look brighter after a couple of weeks of use, and now I can see how it is starting to work with making my wrinkles less noticeable and my skin looks even brighter and better after a couple months of use! Will most definitely be buying a refill!! It also last a long time, which is another great thing about it!< /text>

<Text>For me, there's a skincare product that worked from day one to improve the health of my face.

The use of SkinCeuticals Triple Lipid Restore 2:4:2, began to take away the   thinning, the dryness and the dullness of my skin within a day.  When using this product, I no longer struggle with the peeling of the skin on my forehead and nose.  My skin was bad enough that I actually had to quit wearing makeup.  And since my makeup had UV protection included in the formula, I not only lost the protection I needed, but the flaws women work to hide were more visible than ever.  For me as a woman, who was fortunate to have pretty skin for most of my life, that was devastating.

After surgery for basal cell carcinoma on my eyelid,  I was ready to try anything to protect my skin from UV rays, and not to go through the torture of cancer again.  And today, I believe with help from this product, I'm still cancer free!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80c2dbdd85a4b385:0x414317a2f252ebb4< /GmapID></record>

I have been using Skincare Market, Inc for years.  They have the best prices I have seen online for Skinceutical products.  Their customer services are excellent and the shipping time is very good.  I usually receive my order in 2-4 days after order.  They also occasionally have 5% off coupons, which is a great help, because Skinceutical products are quite pricey (but excellent).</review>

A terrific place to buy your skin products.   I use Dermalogica products and Skincare Market is the only place I get at discount. The products arrive in a day or two....probably faster than I can get out to pick them up at spa. Recommend.< /text>

I have purchased Skin Medica products previously through my aesthetician, but at a much steeper price. I was pleased, yet skeptical, to discover Skincare Market was offering the same wonderful products at such a reduced rate. I thought perhaps they would not be authentic. Happily, my doubts were resolved after receiving my first order. The website is easy to navigate and my order arrived promptly.  I will be using them from now on!<//text>

I have been using Skin Ceutical Serum 15 AOX for many years, and at 64 years old, it has kept my skin amazingly youthful, so I was upset when the 15 got discontinued, but found it had been replaced by Skin Ceutical 20, but the price went up significantly. I was pleasantly surprised that this company, SkinCare Market, offered this product at a more reasonable price. Delivery was prompt and free shipping so I am one very happy customer!< /review>

I purchased Obagi sunscreen 16.9 oz and had it delivered within 3 days. Not many places offer this size and I wanted to make sure it was 100% guaranteed so I chose this company for the first time. The price was very reasonable, and the ordering and delivery were easy and timely. I will most certainly order my products thru them in the future.< /Text>

Skincare Market, Inc. (SMI) is not only a outstanding company, it is an ethical one as well. I placed an order for- 4 KN95 Face Mask 5 Packs on May 21, 2020. The Grand Total for that order was $75.96. On July 29, 2020, another order for KN95 Face Mask 20 Pack was placed. The Grand Total for this order was $36.94. When I asked what was the reason for the price decrease, I was told that SMI found a more competitive supplier for the KN95 Masks and decided to pass any savings to their customers. A practice like I just described is almost unheard of in today's business climate...let alone a business climate challenged by Covid-19! THANK YOU Skincare Market, Inc for always doing a great job but also
DOING THE RIGHT THING!!!!< /Review>

<text>I have been buying CE Ferulic from Skincare Market for years after my dermatologist recommended the product.  I have been very happy with the effectiveness of the product.  I am in my early 60s and completely abused my skin for the first 40+ years of my life, obsessively seeking a tan and playing sports outside 12 months out of the year.  After using CE Ferulic (and getting laser treatments and using powerful prescriptions), my skin looks pretty similar to the way it did 20 years ago.

I have been very happy with Skincare Market and its customer service.  It is very reliable and I never have any concern that I am getting a counterfeit product when I order from the company.  The product is very expensive so I appreciate the 5 percent discount and free shipping that they offer on my orders.  I looked online to try to find a substantially cheaper way of getting the product, but never found one, at least from a company that did not appear to be a fly-by-night, sketchy outfit.

I highly recommend CE Ferulic and Skincare Market.< /text>< Pictures>

Excellent website, I found what I needed and the products they offer are awesome!
I spent hours in other websites trying to find the products I wanted, and have them shipped to Chile, however, at Skincare Market, it didn't take me more than 10 minutes to do it. Thank you!< /text>

<review>I have been ordering from Skincare Market for several years now. I order Skinceutical and Dermalogica brands mainly. I probably would not be able to afford to use these great brands if not for the great discounted prices that Skincare Market provides. They are able to deliver within just a few days for the most part. If there has ever been a problem, it was taken care of quickly. I have been very satisfied and would recommend this site highly.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

I have been ordering from Skincare Market for several years now. I order Skinceutical and Dermalogica brands mainly. I probably would not be able to afford to use these great brands if not for the great discounted prices that Skincare Market provides. They are able to deliver within just a few days for the most part. If there has ever been a problem, it was taken care of quickly. I have been very satisfied and would recommend this site highly.<//Text>

I purchased skin medica tinted skin repair with sunscreen  and I love it. I use it everyday, alone or underneath my foundation.  I previously used a different brand, but after trying skin medica and seeing the results, I am hooked!<//review>

Just like most, if the customer service is lousy or the product is not up to par I would shop elsewhere.  For several years I've shopped here and at Blue Mercury for Dermalogica products.  The only difference is I don't deal with the snark factor when shopping at Skincare Market.  The products have always been as advertised and if I have a question customer service has always been very helpful.< /Text>

I have been shopping Skincare Market Inc for several years &
find excellent prices compared to other sites that sell skin care
products.
I just purchased  SkinMedica HA5 Rejuvenating Hydrator
(2 oz) size. I use it AM & PM for lines around my mouth & find that
that it has helped plump the skin around my mouth compared
to when I don't use it. I have been using this product for years
since my esthetician recommended it for my skin. I highly
recommend this product!< /Text>

SkinCareMarket has good discounted prices on high end skincare products.
I mostly buy SkinCeuticals products that you never find at a discount price.
I also love the fast/free shipping and no sale taxes...
I've always been happy with my purchases and highly recommend the site.< /Text>

<Name>B Tur< /Name><Text>I purchased two products which I've used before....PCA hydrating broad spectrum 30spf daily facial cream. I use it every day. It's light...not heavy or visible like a lot of facial creams.
The second produce was a Image Vital C hydrating water burst. I use it every night especially when I use Strivectin. It's also very light, but very hydrating ....you don't have to use much at all so it lasts forever!</Text><Date>1597843817384< /Date><Gmap_id>0x80c2dbdd85a4b385:0x414317a2f252ebb4< /Gmap_id>< userid>

<Text>Purchasing from Skincare Market is as easy as can be! Orders are filled quickly with tracking info emailed to you.  I've been using Obagi products for 15 years now and love them all. My favorite is the Elastiderm Eye Cream.  It's not oily and stays on my skin till I wash it off in the morning.  The Nu-derm cleanser and toner are fabulous too leaving my skin clean and soft, not tight and dry.  I highly recommend this product line if you like to hear compliments such as "You're how old? You don't look it!"< /Text>< time>

Okay, first off, I love this Store because they list ingredients so CLEARLY and EASY for me to find. I have a ton of allergic reactions that I need to steer clear and Faaarr-F-A-R away from certain ingredients, so the fact that this website lists all in plain sight is a major thumbs up. 2nd, they have better prices than the Mall!! I got it delivered to my door cheaper than going to my local Mall!! 3rd: Free shipping too!! 4th: They have other favorite high end products: Clarins, SkinCeuticals, Obaji, etc., and 5th they also have the best tools, Kabuki brushes, Bamboo brushes. I cannot tell you how Happy I am to find ONE store that lists all the ingredients CLEARLY in plain sight so I don’t have to keep searching the internet for package ingredients!! This is really important to me, since I already know what my skin is allergic too, so to find a website that can be honest about all their ingredients so I can find gentle products in one place, is AWESOME to me. Thank you Skincare Market! I’m VERY pleased to find an online store that I can see all the ingredients and buy high end products for less money than Mall stores in one easy place. Kind regards, Jessica</Text>

I have used Skincare Market for years & will continue to order my products from them. Their products are never expired & the prices are great. I always receive my orders within a few days & if I receive the wrong product (which rarely happens) the exchange process is very easy.</review>

Their every day prices are always lower than retail, and their service has been flawless.</review>< pictures>

< Review>
They sell FAKE N95 Masks. They never refunded me despite contacting them and opening a case with the better business bureau. The owner Jason lied to me over the phone about him giving me a refund (he never did). Do not trust these Google reviews, instead look at the businesses F score on the BBB website ( Better Business Bureau)< /Review>

When my esthetician had to stop doing facials because of COVID I didn't have a source for my skincare products.  I found Skincare Market and have been very happy with their service--easy to use website and fast delivery.</review>

This is my go-to store for skincare products. I always get a great price on the products I use (mostly SkinCeuticals Vitamin C serum) and it ships fast.<//review>

<Text>Been buying for them still last year and love the produces and the prices.  I was originally buying for my doctor's office and paying full paid but now at Skincare Market I have about 30% less plus I get free shipping and additional discount with their specials.  I love that I can get my skincare produces at a great price and all for the comfort of my home.  No sleep on Skincare Market Inc.< /Text><Rate>5<//Rate><name>lisa colepough< /name></record>

I just placed an order a few days ago, for the same skin product (Revision Vitamin C Lotion 30%) that my dermatologist recommended but Skincare Market has a much better price than my dermatologist's office.

<review>The PCA creamy cleanser has been my daily face wash for several years because my skin is left feeling clean, without feeling dried out.  I also use Avene hydrant rehydrating serum before using my daily moisturizer.  It helps my face feel hydrated throughout the day, without feeling thick and heavy. I decided to purchase Avene hydrant rehydrating serum from the Staff Favorites list.  Thanks to their recommendation, I have found something that I love to use.  Thank you :)</review>< response>

I am a 71 year old male who get sun blotches on my arms if I am out in the Florida sun for more than 15 minutes. After using Elta MD Skincare "UV Sport Broad-Spectrum SPF 50 Lotion I can be out in the Florida sun for hours without getting any sun blotches. Great product and I will continue to use it.<//review>
