It’s a good place to shop because they always put in new stuff and not always have it. But try to keep it In store for more time because people are out here trying to buy an item and once they come back it’s gone and something new is up, just try to keep it longer. Everyone is nice in there and it’s well organized<//text>

Get the app or become a rewards member or both to each up points to get towards small coupons. If you open the app every day, you'll have a $5 off coupon in no time. I really like this location because it's an outdoor mall and this store is right next ot Ulta (its between H&M and Ulta),  another favorite store of mine. urban sells a style of clothes that you cannot really find at too many other stores sp I really like this store.

<Text>I just got back from a trip to this store at 3pm this Saturday. While the clothing selection at this Urban outfitters is by far one of the best in so cal, the customer service is beyond poor.

I asked my husband to get me another size (something the attendant should have been helping me with) and he asked the attendant for a large and a medium in the pants I tried on.

Not only was her attitude not helpful, she was rude and told us they didn't have a medium or a large. Interesting because I saw a large myself when I picked up the original pants!

I headed back and got myself both a medium and small and the attendant said nothing about the fact that she said they didn't exist.

Fast forward to check out, and after a person left the register I proceeded to wait for the girl at the checkout counter to call me up. She didn't. She just stood there and stared at me. I asked if she was going to help me and she said nothing, I wasn't sure if she was even helping people at the counter. When I get to the counter I asked if she was going to help me and she said yes with an eye roll. Excuse me for bothering you on what must've been your day off!

Don't go there expecting good service or any type of help from the employees here. It left such a bad taste in my mouth I don't think I'll return.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I walked in to exchange something out. As I was waking around I noticed there were three employees just following me around. First of all what I make in a day these employees make every two weeks as one paycheck. Hence I can afford these items and I don’t have the need to steal. Never in my life have I felt so uncomfortable in a store. Secondly a guy with overalls demanded to take my returned order to the front and have it on hold (?)... not to mention he was really rude and just grabbed it from my hands before I could even answer him. My brother was also there with me and he wasn’t buying anything, he was just accompanying me. Three other employees were following him around too and harassing him. If your employees continue to harass your customers and make them extremely uncomfortable, there goes your clientele and business.</review>

I just love the store in general. I know that every once in awhile, there will be a snooty salesperson. But not as often as you'd think. Probably about less than every other month. The clothes are somewhat overpriced, but they have awesome sales!!</text>

Its UO so theres a bunch of teens who wear trendy clothing, everything in there is whats in style, so expect for it to change every 2 months.

Im a male so i checked out the male section, and there honestly isnt much compared to the huge selection for females.
I say check out the website instead.< /review>< Pictures>

Awesome service! Thank you Joseph and your team for everything! My refinance wasn’t an easy one but you and your team work hard and endlessly to get it done for me. I work 2 jobs and have to handle a newborn baby and you made my refinance painless and less stressful. Thank you again for all your help.

Patrick is hands down the most honest and transparent salesperson we have ever dealt with. He gave us all the information we needed to make a decision and was not at all pushy. We got a great rate for our refinance and the whole process was seamless. As well as being a great loan officer, Patrick also supports the veteran community and donates a portion of his commission to veteran housing organizations, which is awesome. Thanks, Patrick!< /Review>

<review>With mortgage rates dropping so low in the past couple of years, I have used SELFi twice now to refinance.  Both experiences were painless, transparent, and surprisingly quick.  Joseph and Kevin are passionate and will go to bat for you in the process.  They also provide really impressive rates, and when comparing with others, i found SELFi often had better lender credits at no additional cost compared to the same interest rates at other companies.  Of course, these other companies will tell you that they'll match better offers, but I'd prefer to skip that nonsense and work with someone who gives me a great price without making me negotiate.</review>< time>

<Review>Joseph responds very quickly even I never talked to him over the phone or met him personally. He was very professional. He helps me to finished the refinance mortgage loans at the best rate. (3.5% to 2.5% 30-year fixed). It takes only one month from start to finish. he was one step ahead in the process and answers all my questions. I really recommend him and working with him again. Thank you, Joseph, I appreciated your help.</Review></record>

Joseph was a pleasure to work with on my refinance and got me the best rate after I checked several other lenders such as better.com.  He made the process clear and straightforward and was always quick to respond to a couple of questions I had by email.  Almost entire process was done remotely except for 10 minutes to sign required documents with notary safely with masks on my front porch.  Almost all documents were able to be e-signed.  Joseph also covered the cost of extending the rate lock for an additional week after there were some unavoidable delays due to my work HR department and homeowners association being out over the holidays.  Joseph helped save me a lot of money and I highly recommend!</review>

<Review>I worked with Stacy Mitchel for my home loan refinance. She was very professional and did her best to answer your questions ASAP help you to communicate with loan underwriting.  I would like to work with her if I have any loan applications in the future, it will save a lot of headache to deal with loan underwriting.

PS I like SELFI website for documents viewing and down/uploading.< /Review>< pics>

The wife and I were dealing with another refinance officer when we noticed several red flags of issues concerning her integrity. We decided to contact a good friend who turned us over to Pat and let me tell you, that was the smartest decision we ever made! Pat Dolan is honest and holds his clients best interests as his number 1 priority!  We saved over 3k with Pat and our percentage was lower then what we had been offered! Pat is personable yet always professional and I can’t tell you how fricken lucky we were to have him secure our refinance! If you want honesty, integrity, trust and relentless dedication then Pat Dolan is where your gonna find it!! —Your amazing Pat! Thankyou for rescuing us!<//text>

I was a little skeptical of the concept of Selfi. Refinancing can be a consuming task, and I was concerned about not meeting a broker in person; however, based on the reviews and my perception that my refi situation was pretty straightforward, I decided to give Selfi a chance. Now that the process is complete, I'm thrilled. The result was an embarrassingly low-interest rate, very reasonable closing fees, and a new lender that looks to be easy to work with. It took a little longer than I'd expected, but I assume that has to do with how many folks are refinancing now. I worked with Erica, and despite the longer than anticipated runway, she kept me informed and maintained my rate lock weeks past the expected closing date. Again, my loan situation was pretty straightforward. I don't know what this process would be like for a more complicated loan, but I would 100% recommend this service to anyone who thinks they have an uncomplicated loan and good financial documentation. The entire process was very manageable, and for me, the result is an outstanding loan with a great rate and savings that will make a huge difference every month for years to come! Thank you, Erica and Selfi!</review>

<Text>I just closed on a cash-out refinance with SELFi and Mortgage Coach Zach Gilbert. Zach was incredibly helpful, professional and kind. I was able to lock on a rate that was unimaginably low and the process was astonishingly fast.

I was so happy to find SELFi after spending several weeks researching rates and comparing quotes from multiple lenders and brokers. From the very first interaction I felt confident that SELFi was the right choice. The online application was completely transparent and super simple, Joseph promptly followed up to discuss my refi needs and provided expert guidance on loan options, and the rate and fees easily beat all of the other quotes I received from competitors. We closed quickly despite a delay on my end, and the entire experience was incredibly convenient! Highly recommend SELFi!<//review>

I can't say enough good things about Joseph. I just finished my first refi and Joseph was extremely helpful to and patient with me. Also, the rate and fees he gave me were incredible. I highly recommend him to anyone considering a home purchase or a refi.<//review>

<review>I refinanced twice with Joseph Flannery, SELFI, in the past year and it was by far one of the simplest ways to take advantage of the low interest rates that have been available.  All a borrower needs to do, is search the current rates available, complete an application, upload the require documentation and allow Joseph and SELFI to do the rest.   All this done on your computer and the only in person contact, is when a notary comes to your house, or any location you choose, to sign the documents.  I would highly recommend Joseph and SELFI if you are thinking about refinancing your home.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>We came across SELFi while researching rates and lenders after having already started the re-fi process with another lender, which we were having a horrible experience with.  Can't say enough how glad we were to find Joseph and give SELFi and chance and ultimately choose them as our lender.

Joseph was so responsive to all of our questions and correspondence.  He always replied quickly to us and we never felt like he was rushing us or pressuring us to make any decisions.  We appreciated that so much of the process could be handled online, digitally - no faxing or in-person steps, and no one in our house until closing.  The entire process was very easy and we closed quicker than we thought we would.  SELFi also offered us the best rate and a loan option that we felt worked best for us.

We will definitely be referring Joseph and SELFi to everyone we know that might be in the market for their services, and look forward to working with Joseph in the future.  Thank you, Joseph!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

I was currently doing a refi via a bank which had started in July, hadn’t closed by November and was now an uncompetitive rate. Within a week with SELFi I was closing on a better rate. These guys are so proactive, better than any of the other mortgage brokers I’ve used by far and you’d think going direct to a lender would get you a better rate. Not true. SELFi got the best rates for me by far, a huge difference. I don’t normally write up reviews but I think this is worth it given just how good their service is. Simply awesome, if you can, it’s definitely worth you checking them out. SELFi are now clearly my first choice.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Selfi is a great company. I shopped around for my refinance (including Better.com) and Selfi had the best rates at the lowest cost. If you're on the fence trying to decide which company to go with, just go with Selfi. Joseph won't pressure you and he will find you a great deal + provides excellent customer service. Highly recommend!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I am an avid shopper. Selfi offer the best rates , lowest costs. What you see is what you get, rather refreshing in the loan business. The process could not have been any easier. I have now done 2 refi's with Selfi if rates keep going down, I would not hesitate at doing a third !</Text>

Selfi offers a winning combination of low rates and easy execution. Joseph, our mortgage broker, was super responsive and communicated clearly. In addition, Selfi's application portal was easy to use and allowed for our documentation to be uploaded securely - no emailing sensitive information back and forth. Selfi paired us with Quicken Loans, and the lender - as well as the lender's settlement service Amrock - were also easy to work with: many of the loan docs were signed electronically!

If you're looking to refi at a great rate, I'd highly recommend Selfi.< /Text>

<user_name>Amit Das<//user_name><Date>1593398865860<//Date><Rating>5<//Rating><review>Just close my refinance few days back. Was looking to refinance my home loan. I was shopping around. Got estimate from other companies and initially went with better.com as they were giving me better rate and credit. I gave deposit to better.com; but even after 2 weeks they did not do appraisal. In the mean time, Joseph contacted me and offered me lower rate and higher credit. I accepted that offer and moved to Selfi. The offer was compensating my deposit with better.com and giving me lower rate. The very next day, appraisal for my property was done. It took 3 weeks to close, after I accepted the offer (better.com did not do my appraisal even after 2 weeks). Throughout the process, Joseph was so responsive and made it smooth. He is honest and will not hide anything from you.
The best part during this refinance process was, everything was done right from our house. The closing agent came to our house and took our signatures :). I would highly recommend Selfi to anyone looking to refinance their loan. For those, who are thinking twice about online refinancing, I would suggest them to do refinance online. It will not only save your time, but also you will get better rate.</review>< pics>

<review>Overall a really easy and quick experience.  It was difficult getting quick responses from Dalton or Joseph so you will need to be patient when trying to get immediate answers to questions.  There were also a few hiccups with the rate lock but Joseph and Dalton made it right by ensuring I received the credit and rate I requested to lock.  I especially appreciated the hybrid closing which allowed for as little wet signatures with the Notary as possible.</review>< Pics>

Joseph made this refi a breeze-- less than 4 weeks from first phone call to close. the process was not only fast, but highly efficient-- e-tools user friendly and much less paperwork required than other mortgages we have closed in the past 10 years. Lastly, Joseph was highly knowledgeable, super responsive and helped whenever i had questions-- 5 stars!<//Text>

One of the best refinancing places I happened to deal with. Happened to get my refinance via SELFi and Joseph was very responsive for the questions I had. Finally he got locked at a much lower rate and ZERO closing costs. All went very smoothly until we had to sign in front of notary. Unfortunately the same day California placed a Shelter at home and despite notary had the appointment scheduled it was cancelled. But Joseph worked his magic and the same week notary came home and got papers signed and the loan was closed.
Mind you despite the Fed lowering interest rate, mortgage rates were climbing. Thanks Joseph.</text>

<user>107073644224575278965< /user><Review>I had all ready contacted other loan sites for refinancing quotes, when I came across the Selfi site. This site clearly explains the the ins and outs of obtain a loan and refinancing, especially what all those add-on loan fees mean.  I really dislike those low loan rate advertisement which have greedy absorbent fees tacked on.  This is not the case with Selfi and Joseph and his team.  To keep this short, read the other reviews.  What is being said is true.  Everyone has different requirements and Joseph can find the loan that is best for your requirements.  My requirement was to refinance my current principle and 4% 30-year loan rate to to the lowest rate and keep the closing cost as little as possible.  I was hoping for a loan rate in the low 3's.  Guess what?  I got a loan rate at 2.77% 29-year (a monthly special by Quicken) and my closing cost were $803 after a $707 credit.  The savings in my monthly payment will cover my loan cost in less than 3 months.  Am I happy?  You bet!  Joseph and his team made this possible.
Check out Selfi and I hope you end up as happy as I am.<//Review>< Name>

I was a little bit hesitant at first to do my refinance through an online company, but after talking with a couple of the Selfi associates on the phone, I felt confident that this was a good option for me. Selfi got me an amazing rate, the process was very simple, and Joseph and his associates are extremely responsive and helpful. Overall a great experience!< /review>

Lending standards for self-employed persons changed in the middle of the review of my application, due to COVID-19. Additional documentation was requested, and review was much longer... the refinance took about two months to complete. During this time I was kept apprised of the situation by Dalton and Joseph every week. They advised me to wait for a 15 day lock on my interest rate and that worked out great for me, as interest rates went down 1/4 percent while we waited. Closing costs were a lot less than my last refinance, and I am a happy camper. I would definitely recommend SELFi to others.<//Text>

SELFi's approach to refinancing is no-nonsense, provides immense added value in its simplicity, and achieves the best result possible with minimal effort.

SELFi doesn't hide current rates behind lengthy information gathering forms or force you to pick up the phone (which is already ringing constantly with tons of unwanted spam calls from other lenders) to get a quote. The rate I was initially quoted was the same rate at closing. Oh and did I mention? That rate was a full twenty basis points lower (!) than the next best rate I could find out there after an extensive search. We are tremendously grateful for the smooth experience, and so happy that we discovered SELFi before locking in with another lender. Highly recommended and will definitely be sending friends to you.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<userid>111334072332251696955< /userid><Review>If you are trying to find the lowest rate and fees for a mortgage refinance, you must use SELFi.com! I had the most amazing lending experience with them. My loan closed in less than 8 working days from when I submitted my online application. I got the lowest rate I could find. It was probably 0.5% to 1.0% less than other companies, which makes a huge difference in interest paid over the loan. Both Dalton and Joseph were extremely responsive, I got replies within an hour or two each time. Very low closing costs. The best thing about this experience is how transparent the rate/fees/etc are before you even apply, which is super important so you're not getting lots of hard credit pulls from multiple lenders. Also, other companies I've worked with in the past have not been very transparent, then you get to the end, and discover higher fees/rates/etc. I cannot recommend these guys enough. I'm hard to impress and cynical, so I wouldn't be writing this review if I didn't fully endorse their product and service. I rely on reviews! The refi DIY information on their website was great also. Thanks guys! I'm now saving $1k per month and have the lowest rate of anyone I know!<//Review>< response>

The whole process of refinancing can be intimidating and overwhelming for most people but our experience with SELFi, and Joseph went smooth.    Joseph was very patient with our questions and made the whole process easier than we thought possible.   We will gladly recommend SELFi to anybody who wants to refinance their mortgages.

I don't typically do reviews, but felt compelled here. Wow! Joseph is amazing. I spent weeks searching for rates and had a friend "in the business" help me get a rate. Not only did Selfi blow them out of the water with its rates, but Joseph was an absolute pleasure to work with. Very responsive, extremely helpful advice throughout the process, and, for those who prefer to work by email instead of phone, he did all the work without a single phone call! I wish I could give 10 stars! I've already referred him to some friends and family. Thanks again for all your help!<//Text>

<text>Two weeks ago I closed escrow and it was Joseph’s hard work that made it possible. Got me good rates give me credit on closing cost so I only had to come up with a 5% down payment. I do regret one thing, not working with him on my purchase my other properties. Highly recommended he knows his stuff and he’s very organized. Definitely will be working together soon.<//text>< Pics>

<Review>While shopping for rates for a refinance, I came across SELFi. In addition to a great rate and pricing, Joseph was available throughout the process to answer any questions we had and guide us from filing our application through closing.

Due to COVID-19, we were able to get our appraisal waived, and the closing was completed in a way that made us feel safe.

His commitment to service was a big part of why I chose SELFi for our refi, and I wholeheartedly recommend this service to others.

Thanks, Joseph!<//Review>< GmapID>

<review>I spent months searching for a company that could offer refinancing with zero or little upfront costs. I considered going with companies like lending tree, better.com and of course the usual big banks and credit unions but quickly realized that I'd be in a world of a mess with spam and credit inquiries after reading through hundreds of reviews. I finally stumbled upon Selfi and loved how transparent the website was. There wasn't much reviews so of course I was a little hesitant but it didn't take long for me to have some faith. I decided to plug the trigger and just inquire through the website to see what it was all about (no credit pull, or application submission yet). I immediately received a response from Joseph in less than 15 minutes. Aside from the response time, I was more intrigued with the fact that Joseph wasn't your typical online sales rep with a noisy background and script-like responses. I loved the fact that Joseph never pushed me to pull my credit or submit any details during our initial conversations, he actually took the time to understand my situation - what I think my credit score is, what I want or plan to do and of course what I'm more comfortable doing. After a few conversations with Joseph I decided to pull an official quote to get a better idea of the numbers. Joseph got back to me in less than 2 hours after I submitted my information and gave me his recommendations. I informed him that I'd need to shop around for due diligence and he of course was more than okay with that. It took me about 4 days to finally come back to Joseph and proceed after comparing with over 8 FIs, CUs and other refi companies. Fast forward and in a nutshell, I got GREAT rates and terms, primarily dealth with Joseph through email (which I love), was given clear and concise details on all the steps involved, enjoyed the fully digital experience of this refinance, never had to leave my house and best of all - I WAS PAID to refinance! I'd highly recommend Selfi to anyone that wants to refinance their mortgage without all the BS. Joseph, thank you so much for your patience and understanding with my refinance. I appreciate all the knowledge and effort you shared, especially since this all happened right when COVID started.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Selfi gave me the best total package, hands down.  Joseph was responsive, easy to work with, and transparent throughout the process.  I would recommend Selfi to anyone interested in refinancing.< /Review><username>Greg Fleck</username></record>

<Review>This Google listing enabled me to buy an investment property in a CRAZY market, at under market rate--Joseph is a miracle worker!

I work for myself so don't have W-2's to *legitimize* my finances. I looked around for almost 3 years before I was able to find someone who was NOT a hard money or *portfolio* lender wiling to give me a loan.
I was used to being quoted 5.8-7% interest, so when Joseph came in with a rate in the 4's, I frankly didn't believe it.
Though he was VERY responsive and patient, my realtor and I still couldn't believe that he could get rates FROM Quicken, UNDER what Quicken quoted me directly, so we were wary of the whole process until it came through.

Seriously. I don't know if anyone knows what it's like to HAVE money, but to not be able to SUBSTANTIATE the money, and though doing so required a lot of paperwork, it all went as smoothly as anyone could've hoped.

Because my house purchase was *unique*, the close had to happen quickly, and we contacted him FIFTEEN business days before we needed to close, AND over the holidays (Nov19-Dec-12) and he made it happen with a day to spare and we closed EARLIER than our agreed upon date.

Now I wouldn't recommend going to him last minute like I did, because I'm sure I was a NIGHTMARE client (SO much paperwork, SO MUCH back and forth to legitimize my finances), so if you're just a *regular* person in search of a loan, you've found your Unicorn in SELFi!

Thanks Joseph!!< /Review>< gmap_id>

I am so fortunate to have done business with Joseph at SELFi.  He is very knowledgeable and genuinely eager to make sure that I understood each and every step of the refinancing process.  Refinancing has always been a "chore" for me, so I was dreading the process, but with SELFi, it was almost effortless.  Seriously, the online application process and interface for communication and document uploading was a breeze.  Joseph called me several times to ensure we were "on the same page" and to give me updates on the progress.  I highly recommend doing business with SELFi.<//Text>

<user_name>Nuno Andrade</user_name><Review>It was a pleasure working with Joseph and SELFi. I had started the refinance process with Better.com a few weeks prior to finding SELFi. Right off the bet, SELFi’s rates were lower. My plan was to go to the finish line with both vendors (Better.com and SELFi) to see which would have the best offer. At the end of the day, I was able to use the SELFi offer to negotiate down the rates on Better.com. Even though there was already sunk cost with Better.com for an inspection, I decided to go with SELFi. The reason was that the experience with Joseph was a lot more personal. There was no waiting around wondering when the next step in the process would happen as Joseph kept me informed every step of the way.  I have already recommended SELFi to a few friends looking to refinance. Great experience!</Review>< resp>

He was very responsive to all my emailed questions and explained everything with a satisfying amount of detail.

I just finished my refinance with SELFi and was very, very happy with the experience. As a point of reference, this refinance was my 5th full, new or refinanced mortgage experience in the last 20 years.

Joseph and Dalton of SELFi were very responsive and available via email, text, and phone as needed. Their site has a lot of great information and something I wish I had available with my previous four mortgage experiences.

Most importantly to myself and probably anyone else trying to figure out who to work with on a new or refinance mortgage, SELFi clearly has the best possible rate/pricing on rates. In fact, I started my refinance process this time around with Better Mortgage, but then a couple of weeks into the process, I discovered SELFi through a Google search.

SELFi's pricing on rates were significantly lower/better than Better Mortgage and any other site I looked at like Amerisave which I had used in the past. It was clear to me that SELFi, as a smaller organization, has a lot more flexibility and ability to be responsive to individual needs and goals than a large organization like Better Mortgage which has standard rules they are required to follow regardless of one's specific situation and refinancing goals. On top of all that, SELFi's application and approval process was much more streamlined, simpler, and faster than Better Mortgage and Amerisave.  As a specific example, although I'm sure it is dependent on property address, credit score, and assets, SELFi didn't require an appraisal for our refinance, saving us over $500 on fees.

Thanks Joseph and Dalton! I highly recommend SELFi for anyone interested in a new or refinance mortgage. They are clearly, by far, the best option out there!</text>

Just finalized my refinance with Joseph at SELFi. He helped me determine the best scenario for me with what I wanted to accomplish. I had tried to Refi directly with Quicken and they denied me. When Joseph contacted me he was confident he could help me. At first I was doubtful, but Joseph was very committed to delivering what he promised and even exceeded expectations. The process was all done online and via email and was so seamless I still can’t believe it’s completed. I will definitely use Joseph and SELFi again and would highly recommend him and SELFi to anyone.</Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>I came across Joseph and SELFi while researching another discount mortgage broker.
I have always gone the traditional route when buying or refinancing and was a little exhausted by the process. I was intrigued by SELFi's  claim that they could beat most any rate as I thought the company I was looking at was making a really good offer and had great reviews themselves. Not only did Joseph beat the rate, but he did it with negative points, giving me a free refi and getting a little cash back.
The process was quick and painless. I had many questions, this being my first internet mortgage experience. Joseph answered them quickly and professionally. In just a few short weeks I was sitting with a closing agent in the comfort of my own home. I lowered my rate by .5125 points on a loan I had just closed on a few months prior.
I would have no problem referring Jonathan and SELFi  to my closest friends and family!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<text>I learned of Joseph because of my son-in-law, who had recently refinanced their home through Selfi. Both my son-in-law and I are in the mortgage industry, and  Joe’s rates beat even our own ‘Employee Loans’ rates. But the rate is only a part of the transaction. The communication, follow through, ease of the process, and on-time closing all made working with Joe enjoyable and stress free. I would definitely endorse him and Selfi.

<Review>Just closed on a refinance with SELFi. Great experience, super easy, and saved a bunch of money.

I had open applications with 4 lenders just because that's what you're "supposed to do" and what we had done last time. I found selfi last, and completed everything first thanks to Joseph. Of the other applications, 2 were (far) more expensive in both rate + closing costs, and 1 just moved so slowly it was like pulling teeth (they ended up wanting 60 days to close after all that so I'm glad).

It's too bad we only have one condo because I'm very much looking forward to working with selfi again in the future.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>This is my second refinance with SELFi and Joseph. The service and the rate is the best. I was offered a great rate without any negotiations or discussions. I did shop around for better rates/deals, but no one can match what SELFi offered. Joseph provided a list of required documents at the beginning, which was very reasonable and no additional documents was required. Lender paid almost all the loan costs, which was great! Initial rates and costs were not changed at closing. From application to closing only took just over 2 weeks. The total experience was very satisfying and I would recommend SELFi for anyone looking for mortgage/refinance.< /Review><Response>{'time': 1571087717013, 'text': 'Thank you and congrats on your SELFi refi!

<user>111485630437581051222<//user><Text>If you are ready to refinance,  stop looking and go with SELFI, you will not find a lower rate or better service anywhere else. Believe me, I shopped around with well over 10 lenders that swore that they would get me the best rates and JG Wentworth even guarantees it, but they couldn't even come close. The best advantage of using SELFI, is that you can search the rates your self and see what they look like daily, and when you're ready all you have to do is tell Joseph you want to lock in that rate. No other lender publishes their rates daily and I just closed a loan at 3.5% and only had to pay $100 to close. No other lender could come close to that! Thanks SELFI!< /Text>< Pics>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>As others have attested to, working with SELFi was awesome! I was looking to refinance, and SELFi provided me with many options. The broker I worked with directly, Joseph Flannery, explained all of the factors to consider when choosing to either 1) pay points for lower interest rates, or 2) cover closing costs, with a lender credit, for higher interest rates. We played scenarios to the end many times, and Joseph was very patient when I had many questions, including some I asked two, three, or four times to make sure I understood his response and the different financial implications of potential decisions. Most importantly, working with SELFi resulted in getting the best interest rate for the best price -- by far! I ended up closing with Quicken. While working with SELFi, Quicken reached out offering to refinance directly (without SELFi serving as a broker). Here's the kicker - the rate I was offered through SELFi was much lower than that the rate Quicken offered directly (I believe it was .5% lower). And I payed less up front! In other words, I was able to receive a lender credit to cover some of my closing costs, and still received a lower interest rate that Quicken was offering me directly, and their direct offer did not include a lender credit. Working with SELFi was truly the best home buying/refi experience I have had, and I highly recommend working with SELFi if you are looking to purchase or refinance!<//review>< Pictures>

< review>
I always say that buying a house is one of the most stressful things you can do in your life, not only because it is a huge life choice and change, but also because nobody in the process cares about the deal as much as you do. For the agents, brokers, banks, and title companies, they do this every single day and it's easy for a buyer to feel like another sheet of paper in the stack.

I had this exact experience with SoFI and Better Mortgage who both “pre-approved” me, assured me I should go and place offers on properties, and then when my offer was accepted were both completely unreachable. After days of phone calls, I was later assured separately and by both lenders that I would never qualify for a mortgage due to my self-employment.

After almost giving up on the whole process, I found SELFi on Yelp and reached out to Joseph. He had an underwritten pre-approval for me within a couple days and got the deal done when nobody else could. In addition, he was super responsive, easy to get in touch with, and easy to work with. I cannot more clearly state my confidence in SELFi and enthusiasm to recommend them to anyone.<//review>

We’ve worked with a few different mortgage companies and brokers over the years, and Joe at SELFi was hands down the best. Not only was he thoughtful, kind, responsive in keeping our refi process on track and answering our many questions, but he delivered on SELFi’s stated promise of saving us money with lower rates … saving $4,000 at closing and in the range of $50,000 over the life of our loan with our reduced monthly mortgage bill. He’s a breath of fresh air – a financial professional with his heart (not greed) in the right place to help the average person pay less. I’ve already started recommending SELFi and Joe to friends, family, and co-workers looking to refi or buy a home.</review>

<Review>SELFi helped my clients with a really difficult REO. They had to go through three lenders before finding someone who would help their unique situation, but SELFi was with them every step of the way, and made it happen. My clients are so happy with their new home!

<review>They carry quality kitchen utensils that are hard to find or aren't commonly found (Pineapple slicer/corer) in your local super store.  Prices are a bit higher than ordering off line but worth the drive if needed now not waiting for shipment & shipping cost. Great prices on Corningware-Corell, luv the colors and designs on the dinnerware & that you can purchase pieces separately. Very helpful clerks as busy as they were, Sarah located everything we were looking for, for us.</review><rate>5< /rate><pictures>None</pictures><userid>109685552538721865630</userid><gmap_id>0x80dc99d016c6d31b:0x17f79f3cad71639a</gmap_id>< resp>

<text>Such a great location! Play dungeons and dragons? They have all your needs covered. Magic the gathering or other TCGs? Covered. They have a healthy selection of board games, minis, dice, mats, sleeves, boxes, unique or hard to find items. Extremely helpful and engaging staff. My go to spot. They hold events as well.</text></record></dataset><record>

Well it was my first time in this store and as interesting and intriguing i found it to be i wish that the gentleman that was working had more time to explain all the different card sets they have available but i didnt even bother to ask because he was constantly busy at the register.</review>

Despite the amount of foot traffic and people coming in and out, I entered in and conducted my business in a timely manner. The workers were patient and more than willing to help out. I have been heading to this establishment ever since they started their business, and there are few places I would visit to obtain trading card items.< /review>

<text>I just started getting into D&D and decided I make this store my first stop for supplies and a choice well made. They have so much D&D merch it was awesome! Most other places I've been to have a wider selection of Warhammer than they do D&D. Definitely recommend!<//text>< pics>

<username>Vannak Phann<//username><review>Definitely a shop that I would love to shop at more but not as friendly as I thought they would be. Walked around the whole store once and zero acknowledgement. Like 4 people standing around aruging about Pokemon packs. I'm not sure if the guy was an employee of close friend, he seemed pretty greedy talking about buying up all the stocks when product is already limited. Pretty sure it was the new champions path. Nice to know customers get the leftovers after they're done. I give props to the girl there trying to say no and save them for other customers.< /review><Date>1601330930514<//Date>< Gmap_id>

When Tier 1 is firing on all cylinders, it's the epitome of a "friendly local game store." Taylor, Victoria and Chip are the beating heart of the biz, they will make sure you find what you're looking for every time :)</review>

I messaged the store through Facebook and was able to receive closeup pictures of the card that I was interested in. The person who helped me was patient with my request and was very responsive. I would definitely shop here again. Thank you!< /text>< gmap_id>

As a fan of board games I love supporting my local gaming shop, and these guys are worth it. I walked in to a friendly atmosphere with people laughing and playing collectible card games together, the manager and other employees chatting companionably with the customers. I called in to order some games and they held them aside for me no problem, and are working to get me the things they couldn't find. Counter service was fast and helpful and prices are standard. There are lots of tables for playing games, and they seemingly hold regular gaming sessions. I will be back!<//text>

My friends, Family and myself have been going here for a few years now for all of our board game and magic the gathering needs. Not only is the staff incredible and knowledgeable but the shop is very clean and has alot of older Magic products for sell. For someone who likes to take a gamble I find myself leaning towards Tier 1 Games for all my magic pack opening needs.<//Text>

Awesome spot to come and hang with like minded individuals. Daily events ranging from card games, board games, and Dungeons & Dragons style games. Staff is extremely helpful and polite, always there if anyone needs help. Would highly recommend anyone to looking to make new friends and have fun in a safe environment.<//review>

I started coming to the board game days on Sunday and they've quickly become the highlight of my week. Cary is a great teacher so I never feel like I lose to him unfairly! (Though, let's face it, the man IS board games) New games are taught and played every week and if you like the game, you can always get a copy for yourself off their shelves. They also take requests on what to stock so if you're looking for something, chances are that if they don't have it yet, they will.
If you're a hobbyist or looking to dip your toe into this golden age of board games we're in, definitely stop by Tier 1. (Game days are Sunday at 5pm!)< /review>

<Text>Absolutely wonderful local business.  They stock board games,  Magic the Gathering, Pokemon TCG, Final Fantasy TCG, Dragon Ball TCG, Dungeons&Dragons and other role playing books, minis, dice... you name it,  they probably have it.  And if you're not sure,  they have an easy to use website that has TCG singles and product listings! Staff is great and so nice! They're always willing and able to help out. There's a spacious area of tables for playing and hanging out.  They hold tons of events weekly.</Text><Response>{'time': 1595778128542, 'text': 'Thank you for your wonderful words.

The staff here is great and we have had many discussions about gaming.  They have a good amount of room and gaming tables.  The owner was an arrogant, rude, douche bag.  He had a pompous attitude when I talked to him about stocking a product that I use.  It seemed like he didn't have the time to help customers because he was too important.<//Text>

Great selection of cards and good prices. Website works great, so if you order online and pick up in-store you can be in and out with what you need in minutes.</review>

Positive is they have a great selection of cards

The negatives is , if you feel like being talked down upon this is your store they will act like you have no idea about anything

Very overpriced on card. They match online prices and charge you extra for the extra shipping it would cost to order online .... If you pick up in store

Example

Card is on tcg that they price Match they will add additional money to the price of the card even if you are in store because they say it would be extra anyways because if you'd order it online there are shipping costs ..... That's utterly ubsurd

Just get your order on Amazon for free shipping and wait a couple days ... Why support a store that is shady

Also that skinny kid that works there needs to get his attitude in check .... Probably the rudest out of them all... Would fire him instantly if he was my employee .... So many people talk about how much of a d bag he is

------------------------------------------------------////////

Update January 2017

This place continuous to overprice even with negative reviews from player base and people not attending the store anymore

I was getting ready to buy a set of tarmogoyfs which they had in stock and even was getting ready to drop money yet they continue to charge 10$ above tcg equal card condition value.
That's 40$ in value which is a playset of thougtseize or something else.

They say they won't match value on tcg due to people will buy them eventually.

So they get money from cheap trade in ontop of an additional value selling to the player base for more money.  I don't see why people still continue the events hosted here.
The place already is dead throughout the week and continues to die.
I wish I could add pictures that I have of the prices and include them I might drop a link later on< /text>

The tour was very well organized. The tour guide was exceptionally knowledgeable and made the tour interesting and fun.
The wolves are amazing. I would highly recommend taking the trip to Julian to visit the center.</Text>

<Text>As a Naturalist, I was super impressed with our tour and Ciera's ability to captivate an audience! All of the staff and volunteers are passionate about the work that they are doing and are true superheroes! Definitely book a tour if you're in Julian and be sure to stop at their gift shop in town since all proceeds go back to support the wolves.

<Date>1604870012737<//Date><rating>5< /rating><text>A relaxing experience, in a small group, with a knowledgeable guide. You'll only see a few wolves since most are intended to remain wild and free of human contact before returning to their natural habitat. The entry fee may seem high but not so if you view it as a contribution to the center's amazing work & mission. A nice way to spend a Sunday near Julian.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVV05UsQdcJyk8XsvVz10Ztbs7ucwXLiHJdEwv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< resp>

<Text>My friend had a camp here for 2 weeks so is very beautiful driving up there absolutely loved it I wouldn't recommend driving in the rain or when it's dark because I stayed at the KD campground right next to the wolf reserve and I didn't see any wolves while I was up there but it's a beautiful trip all together<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<review>This is a must see if you have the opportunity to come here, the information shared and the passion from the volunteers contagious. The wolfs if you are lucky do see them are worth every dollar spent, the gift shop is humble but the fact that every donation helps the wolves you just want to give all the money there. Small presentation is full and packed with information. Overall this is a wonderful place for all, and it's very easy to digest the information. Kids will be super into it, there was so much joy on a little girl that was so into it, she didn't move our spoke because she was so into it.< /review><user>116816050489619557833</user></record>

I enjoyed seeing Wolves and hearing howling. Tour guides were well informed.
Covid precautions need to be strengthened. One adult and one child in my group had obvious respiratory illnesses - coughing sneezing etc. and should have been screened out to protect the group staff and animals.< /review>

I love what they do and the spirit of the admission is towards their efforts. However, the experience you have there is not worth the cost alone. Hopefully your love of animals can carry you through.< /Review>

<Review>Able to see wolves up close, people here were very knowledgeable about the wolves that were on site. Able to answer any and all questions that people asked. Reservations are needed as you are guided to the center by one of the people who work there. Every one is friendly too and the wolves are amazing to see.<//Review><Response>None< /Response>< Rate>

Great small Rehabilitation Center. They have some Ambassador wolves so at least you get to see them and you do learn quite a bit. Full drive up to the area and make sure you Drop in at Julian after your visit to buy a pie and try one of the local beers< /review>

< Review>
This is probably one of the worst experiences I had in my life related to seeing wild animals. I would select 0 starts if it was possible. They charge $30 per person for showing two mid-sized wolves from about a mile away and another three Mexican wolves, which looked more like small dogs rather than wolves :). The tour is supposed to be an hour long, but it'll take you appoximately 20 minutes to drive through the super messed up road to get there. So, I kept asking myself the question of how the $30 fee is spent given the road conditions. Long story short, I would describe the tour as a boring 40 minute poop-show which is not worth a penny. I'd recommend visiting the California Wolf Center if it was free and you had couple of hours to waste for no reason. To be fair, the staff were friendly and nice.< /Review>

<Review>Great experience. Beautiful drive coming from SD. It happened to be pouring rain when we visited and we got absolutely soaked, but it ended up being a good thing, as the wolves love the cool rainy weather and were way more active than usual. The guides were very friendly and informed. Learned a lot and got to see about six different wolves, some of which came very close to the fence.
Great for kids and adults alike. The area around the CWC is beautiful as well.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLAIV2iUwtiBrtMuWGlIa7wg8GdqUpWwDvu4GR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPrcsZmESp6JEitmuTCyQwwrWNwI-8xr2AQbnvz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwu28ZgBdPsY03UyYSmmyo2cb9qyAd_bdLxpb_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dbd130f908b31f:0x910aac346fcb0d41< /Gmap_id></record>

<text>It's educational, enjoyable for all ages, and if you're as lucky as we were, you'll get quite the up-close view of these beautiful animals. Beyond the personal experience, visitor fees contribute to a noble conservation effort. Be sure to read The visitor information on where to meet and wait for entry, and be prepared for a bumpy dirt road for a stretch.</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIRTzkSJJppWVYPQ8O80ndWnVZNJ92eJuQ_wfB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

Very informative.  Guides provide an educational program prior to touring the wolves outside of their enclosure.  They also give more info on the wolves in the enclosure while viewing them. Wish we could have seen more of the wolves but the weather was a bit warm when we were there and they were keeping cool in the shade. We will definitely go back in the cooler months.< /Text>

A wonderful place to take a tour when you are up in Julian! (Be sure to schedule yours ahead they fill up quick.) The staff and guides lead a nice tour and explanation of what they do there to help rehabilitate and introduce wolves back into their natural habitats. Don't expect wolves to be like dogs or to pet them, they aren't interested in humans but it's still a fun learning experience!</Text>

So excited to visit this Wolf Center, a surprise from my brother-in-law and sister. I definately am a wildlife advocate and defender. The staff was so knowledgeable and courteous. The wolves are well cared for and their passions matched mine perfectly. I applaud what they do everyday for our wolves, Mexican and Gray! I was so excited to be so close to the wolves, a dream come true 😗</Review>

<text>Unique and educational. The first part of the tour is inside learning about the wolf. On the second part of the tour they take you to 2 separate enclosures to hopefully observe them in a natural setting. Well worth the money to know you are helping the wolves.< /text>< pics>

<Text>So educational and great to see how knowledgeable and  passionate the workers are here .  No frills experience , but quite unforgettable.  Just when you thought you knew all you needed to know from school, animal planet , or viral videos,  the info shared with you here about wolves takes it several levels up.  If you're looking for lots of interaction and to have your socks knocked off from this experience, you'll probably be disappointed.  But if you're an animal lover and have a genuine interest in seeing these animals au natural , it'll be worth your while.  It's non-profit so you can expect to have to compromise on some comforts.  Really wish the road were more comfortable to drive on and bathroom was better , seating area wasn't so cramped, but we all made it in one piece , were decently comfortable , and got a great deal on Groupon.  We left loving and appreciating these animals so much more and that's what matters.  It isn't too far from Julian main Street too so definitely allot a couple hours to tack this onto your itinerary if you happen to be in the area :)< /Text></record>

This place is amazing and the work they do is so important. The wolves are behind a fence but i was three feet from those wolves. The staff are awesome and knowledgeable. There's no rushing around and you can stay and ask questions. No need to worry about not having a good view, just wait a minute and space to see opens up.  And the wolves were very curious.< /text>

I had a great time here learning about the wolves and also what I was wrong about. I came in with KQ ranch group on a Sunday morning. Bring something warm for cold time of year and something cool for the hot time of year, and if you got a camera with a good zoom, definitely worth bringing it along.< /text>

I recommend  CWC to everyone. Their mission to reintroduce the Mexican Grey Wolf back into the wild by bringing 2 opposing sides to the table (Ranchers and Wolf Advocates) is both refreshing and hopeful. Please visit to learn more.<//review>

Absolutely LOVE the CA Wolf Center. The road is definitely bumpy on the way up, but just adds to the experience. The presentation is very informative, they have a cute gift shop... and the wolves! So gorgeous. The Mexican grey wolves were very active. The North American grey wolves weren't as active, but it was still amazing to see. You should definitely check it out! Then finish the drive to Julian for some apple pie!</Review>

<Review>I guess I expected to see more wolves.  The driver from Oceanside takes 1.5hrs. You get there and first listen to an introduction about the wolves which is great but my 3 year old daughter was already bored after such a long drive.  They only show you two kinds of wolves: Mexican Grey Wolf and American Grey Wolf.  That's it. Good place to visit but maybe not with toddlers.<//Review>< pictures>

Wonderful educational experience. Lots of babies and kids, supports a great cause. See wolves feet from you, very short walk 100ft 3 times but very dustly and hot bring water. Must make a reservation, will be escorted in 30 minutes before tour (not earlier, we were too early). Dirt road so don't wash your car first. A/C and giftshop with $1 water bottles inside during 30 min presentation prior to seeing wolves for another hour or so.< /text>

<review>Amazing conservation efforts happening here and to see wolves up close that still maintain their primal wildness with no human contact... it's a beautiful thing to look into the eye of a wolf. But the looooong intro speech inside the building beforehand (although informative) could have been cut in half.</review><Date>1501309648135< /Date>< pictures>

Knowledgeable staff  teach you a lot about wolves for anout an hour. Then for 20 minutes you get to see wolves in an enclosure. We saw 2 wolves walk by. It was not what I was expecting, but everyone else seemed to enjoy it.< /text>

Fun area with beautiful wolves! There is a half mile of off highway trail before you get to the wolf center so bring your vehicle with the most clearance available.</Text>

<GmapID>0x80dbd130f908b31f:0x910aac346fcb0d41< /GmapID><review>These folks devote their lives to preserving wild wolf populations.  It's NOT an entertainment business (MegLou C), it's tucked away in the mountains for the sake of the safety of the wolves.  You WILL get to see the animals and NOT just hear the keepers discuss wolf facts. The animals will determine how much they will allow themselves to be visible to the visitors...remember they are NOT on display for US.  We are there to learn about them and hopefully help protect their species.  Also, while the center is open to the public, reservations are required and that information is clearly stated on their website.  The dirt road leading to the center is very bumpy but you do NOT need an off-road vehicle...just a moderate level of driving competence. I made the trip twice myself in my 2010 Honda Fit without incident.</review><user>105982085467149017027< /user><Name>Dagmar Midcap< /Name></record>

Ms. Midcap is SO CORRECT and said it so well!!  This place is NOT DISNEYWORLD, NOR A ZOO!!   It is so much more!  The humans here are dedicated, and not getting rich, to helping preserve one of the most important predators on the planet.  They are working hard to continue this important species from "human" predators who would eradicate all wolves, out of stupidity and greed.  We have been there several times, and are always happy to [carefully] observe these incredible animals.  We only wish them [humans and wolves] continued success, in spite of many obstacles!!<//Text>

<Review>A perfect plan if you want to learn a little more about wolves. They will give you a presentation of the project and if you are lucky (90%)you will see the wolves(remember that they are wild animals, this is not a petting zoo) they have a nice little gift shop that have some great things to keep or to give as a present(take a look at the three little pigs story from a wolve point of view) enjoy it.
Be carefulf cause you will drive on a dirt road, you don't need a truck or a 4x4 but avoid low cars or motorcycles (weird rule that they have with bikes, wich i am against)< /Review></record>

< Review>
The location itself is found in the pits of the mountains. The driveway to the place is not paved, so I advice you to take an SUV/truck of some sort with GOOD tires [because you'll need the traction going in and out of that place! When we visited, a sports car (FRS Toyota) was stuck in the bumpy, unpaved "roads"]!!! 😣😐
It's a non-profit and the place is not big at all. You'll go into a house, hear an educational presentation... then you'll walk into the "backyard" to see the wolves in their gated sections.
Overall, it's a good, educational experience. Not a great one! 😞
FYI- the drive to get there is ridiculously long & tedious, didn't feel like it was worth the drive from LA. So for me, it's a 3 star location.</Review>

< Review>
This is the suckiest business ever. Not only are they extremely hard to find, but they only take people in by reservation. Their cause is helped even less by the fact that it costs 20 bucks just to hear someone list off facts about wolves you could find on wikipedia. If these guys want to help wolves they need to set up a visitor center for people who come out to see this place unknowing it takes a reservation and a minimum of 20 bucks a body. Total waste.< /Review>

Been looking for a true butcher in Colorado for many years.  Have found nothing in the Springs that even came close to what I was looking for.  This was was a recommendation and boy were they spot on.  It’s 50 miles from Colorado Springs but worth absolutely every mile of the short trip.  Fantastic meat and I will return OFTEN!< /text>

Love this market!  Since I found it, it has become my first stop for quick groceries in town.  The prices are super great, and the staff is very nice.  Good selection of low-priced pork cuts and chicken, and they also offer a bunch of marinated meats ready to go on the grill.

Also, they serve lunch, the portions are very large.  They make great burritos and tacos, and also specialize in pupusas (a traditional Salvadorian dish made with masa corn).<//text>

< Review>
Most gorgeous ballpark in America! Aside from the amazing baseball that is played here, the views of the Santa Monica, CA Bay are spectacular! The food, device and family friendly atmosphere make this an incredible destination for locals and tourists alike. The wide array of food and drinks is beyond extraordinary! There is arguably 'something for everyone'!!< /Review>

< review>
When I was checking out out around closing time on Saturday 5/22/21, I had several items of all types in my cart, and the cashier girl took a pair of black prada sport loafers that I found, and said, I CAN’T SELL THESE TO YOU. And with like 12 people in line waiting to check out, she walked to the back of the store with them and was gone for a few minutes. Then came back saying, sorry, we have a new lady working back there and she was not supposed to put those out?!?!! She mentioned “how some resellers come there and get lucky” and how she finds good stuff on her day off. So I feel like she just took them for herself to sell or something. Thanks a lot 🙄 I’ll look at my receipt and find her name...< /review>

<rating>2< /rating><Text>As far as Goodwill's are concerned, the prices here are terribly high. Some items I picked out are within 60-90% of Amazon prices for damaged or incomplete items. Definitely not worth it until they lower prices, at least to the same level as every other goodwill I have been to from San Fran to Sacramento. Staff seems unwilling to help, unfortunately.<//Text>< Pics>

<name>rachid rennou<//name><review>Before it was a good,but since they closed some of them in the area the prices was higher, higher,higher
Is supposed to be cheaper because most of those items was used,and the reason why we shopped there was to help the community, I was a regular costumer there ,but now I will never go there again,besides this some of the employees they liked to charge more, it happened to me before there , but there is a good employee I will say just one it is a blonde girl super nice whit all the costumer.
I know they will read this feedback because they don’t care at all they want just money, so I will ask all the responsible to review the prices for god seek a jacket NORTH FACE. For 29$   Come on a suitcase very old we can say it was since WW2 for 30$
my way they must reduce the prices it is not worthy at all to shopper there again<//review><user>107841741160989959571</user>< Rating>

They take almost everything but you have to sort it into bins for them.  Might not be best for your delicate housewares. I have bought some cute things inside tho, including an adorable bird lamp and my favorite leather jacket ($10).<//text>

< Review>
My biggest complaint here is about donating.
Nothing major, just find it annoying when I go to donate things and I'm stopped and said "we don't accept this this and this."
"Ok" so I go back take the things out and come back "we also don't accept this and this".
"Ok, can you give me a comprehensive list or is there one posted so I can only bring you the approved things?"
"No."
...."ok" so I go back take other things out and come back.
"We don't accept this."
Jfc.

Otherwise, store was great, people were friendly and following safety precautions.<//Review>

<Text>Donators- don’t waste your time with this place. After reading the many terrible reviews, I called ahead to ask if they’d accept some clothes and dishes I wanted to donate- they said they would. But when I got there, I was turned away by rude staff (I tried to explain I’d called and it was frustrating to waste 40 min driving there only to have to go somewhere else). Unfortunately the other poor reviews are very accurate< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Name>

I always love shopping at this Goodwill location. The staff is super friendly and helpful and the store is organized.

I spend about an hour but I always find a great deal.< /Review>

Handicap accessible. Parking lot.
The service was nice. The high prices were pretty much brand new retail prices. Sure, belts, books, and scarves are under $3 - but I'm not shopping for that 🤷‍♂️</text>

<review>I had plenty of great stuff to donate . Started with Christmas stuff & first thing they said No Christmas stuff after I loaded it all .So I said that's fine , so I took out the other 5 boxes I had and everything and anything they could see I had they said were not taking this , this , this or this right now . Which was just Ridiculous . I told them I will find somewhere that will be thankful for me donating . Good will use to be good until they want everything brand new so they can sell it for triple . That will be my LAST time ever trying to donate or even shop at goodwill !!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><gmap_id>0x80857e6051440f09:0x4a01530cb4ff291b<//gmap_id><user_name>kara lewis</user_name>< rating>

If you want to donate stuff you're better off trying somewhere else. Many of the times I've come here I've been told to they're not accepting donations because they're full, or it's too late, or whatever else. I've stopped taking stuff here.<//text>

I love digging here. Everyone once in a while, I find something I can't live without. Lots of Target stuff but they should figure out a better way to display it -- furniture packed away in anonymous boxes does not sell itself!</Text>

This is the third time I’ve stopped by and as I’m unloading they close donations. The fact that I’ve been getting my donations out of the trunk means nothing. They treat their donors as a hassle.<//review>

<Rate>3</Rate><Text>Mostly an above-average Goodwill with good selection of real clothes (not a costume store so don't bother with that) and friendly staff. The problem with this location is all too frequently the donation staff out back gets overwhelmed and unilaterally declares that they're not taking any more donations for the day. I've had to call corporate office so many times, now I just tell them let's skip my call to the corporate office and please just take my small donation. Then it's usually over with and we have a laugh. But it's annoying to have to go through that.<//Text>< user_id>

This place totally sucks. Everything is overpriced. It has all been priced with a dry erase marker which I guess comes off – still you got a wonder why they can’t just avoid writing directly on their items.<//Review>

WoW Shopping on a budget cant get better than Goodwill and a dollar Store.. This Goodwill has cleanliness, organized, friendly, and they got alot of nice summer clothes right now decent prices some things someone gave to them brand new. I love it because you can walk in and never know what you will find or come home with. Somebody else trash is someone else treasure now</Text>

it is a neighborhood store in Emeryville but it has dramatically changed the customer friendly store in price to customer unfriendly store since a lady who marks the price brigade (asst. Manager) has come. most of the items are used items but she overprice  and favors only few she would consider "Good customer". store is full because ignorance runs galore. e.g. ikea items are sold here more than ikea original.<//review>

Equinox made the refinance experience easy. Although it was a lengthy process (approximately 4 months) and there were some delays, it was to be expected. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The only minor issue we had was, a few days before closing we were told we'd be contacted to schedule the closing. The day they called to schedule, we were told the closing had to be done the same day or it'd have to be scheduled the following month. We were not home and afraid we'd miss the cutoff. However, they were able to manage getting the notary to our location and the closing went smoothly. I would recommend using Equinox Home Financing!< /text>

I choose Equinox for refinancing because they already have my prior loan file.  All the personnel that I came in contact were highly efficient and professional.  They answered all my questions and followed up quickly.  It took exactly 30 days from the time I made first contact till the loan funded/closing.< /Review>

I just closed on a refinance with Equinox and had a very positive experience.   I was able to refinance with a lower interest rate and reduce my monthly payments.  It was honestly the shortest loan processing time I have ever experienced with no hidden costs, no gotchas, or any other surprises.  The team I worked with was highly professional, courteous and responsive.  I would highly recommend this company for any of your mortgage needs!</Text>

Thank you Equinox team for helping my family and I make the most important decision of our life. Special thank you to our Mortgage Loan officer Cathy Bui for the above and beyond assistance she provided to us. She was professional, informative and transparent. She earned our trust immediately and we couldn’t have closed without her support.< /Text>

Michael, Nancy and Annabelle made our experience with Equinox unbelievable simple and timely. Not only did each of them treat my wife and me with respect, they were always willing to answer any question we had, with very little delay. I highly recommend their services.</review>

<user>116598961140717604667</user><review>For the most part everything was great. They got me a really low interest rate for my refinance and made everything super easy.  They took care of everything after I sent my documents in, and they even arranged for the notary to come to my house to sign the papers. My only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was that toward the end of the process the communication wasn’t as good as at the beginning.  I was not well informed of the cash that would still be needed to close. So when the notary came for the signing, he was the one that told me I needed to write a check for a large sum (over a thousand dollars) it was quite the unpleasant surprise.  Other than that, the experience was very good and I would go with them again if I wanted to refinance.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Equinox was the easiest ReFi I have ever done.  From the first contract, Anthony, that got the loan started and the easy processing through Katie and Judy, it has been a very smooth transaction and fast!
I went from a 4.5% to a 2.875% and saved tons of money for choosing Equinox.
I can't say enough about their professionalism and impeccable follow through!  I'm so pleased!

I was able to save $197 a month with my refinance, and I had to put down a very small amount for a down payment since Equinox was able to arrange to have the seller pay a large portion. We had some communication issues which led to some frustration for me. However, they gifted me some cash at the end to make up for the frustration.  The refinance took about 2 months, but it was worth the wait! Thanks, Equinox, and I wish you all the best!<//Review>

This was my 3rd refinance in the last 3 years, my first 2 were absolute nightmares so I was expecting the same.  They proved me wrong!  The people at Equinox, especially Tony & Cathy went above and beyond to give me the best experience I've ever had.  They returned all my calls, promises made, promises kept.  This refi was quick, easy, efficient and I enjoyed working with all of them.  I would highly recommend you contact them if your in need for any kind of refinancing.  They are the best, if I could give them 10 stars I would...keep up the great work Equinox!!!<//Review>

I was shopping online and came across Equinox. I gave them a call and spoke with Archie. He was very kind and knowledgeable. He sent me an email with all the required documents needed. The process had been smooth and communication has been very responsive. The best part of it all is the low rate I received. I must say I've spoken to a few people and Archie was by far the most professional person the way everything was handled and communicated! Would recommend to anyone.< /review>

The whole experience with Equinox, start to finish, was superb. The team was very patient, attentive, thorough, reliable and responsible.  I can't say enough good things about my interactions with Katie and Briana, and Christina. Every question I had was answered promptly, every step in the process explained thoroughly, my wishes and needs were their top priority. I am so happy I found Equinox, and will use them again if I refinance again or purchase another home in the future.  Thanks, Equinox, for adhering to the highest standards of integrity in business practices and in customer service.<//text>

I would like to take a moment and thank Equinox Home Financing and especially Nancy Hoang, for being supportive and helpful throughout the whole process! Any time of the day Nancy was there to answer our questions and provide advice. Thank you to Equionx Home Financing for helping us drop our interest rate in half when no other lender would! Keep up the great work! Will definitely recommend to all of our family and friends.< /review>

Equinox financing was very helpful in the loan refinance process. Cathy Bui and Randy Cho made the process very easy as they guided me through the process. I looked at several similar companies and after carefully examining   their responses to my application , concluded that Equinox was the best company to use.< /Review>

<review>Was in the market for home refinancing and came across equinox. I had talked to a couple other companies prior to this and I felt like I could get a better offer. Originally I talked with Kevin Fabian, he was prompt and professional in getting the process started. The rest of the process was handled by Thanya Mercado, who was able to keep the lines of communication open throughout the process. Overall I had a positive experience. My critiques would include improvement to the document uploading system and more realistic outcomes as far as closing dates. I had uploaded the same documents several times and even signed some and the company never received them or could not see them in their own system. I was also promised to close in the next couple weeks at least three times. I would definitely recommend this company at this time.< /review>< Pics>

John and Thanya were very responsive, helpful and kind. The application process was quick, and they provided updates throughout the process. John was even able to lower my rate after the rate lock! I also received a follow up call from Christine to make sure I was satisfied. I highly recommend the Equinox Home Financing team!<//text>

Let me start by saying that I'm a Branch Manager at a COMPETING mortgage company, so it's probably in my interest to not leave this review.  But, I was so moved by John Doan's professionalism that I decided to break the norm and share my experience.  I had a very tough loan for a client of mine that we couldn't complete at my company.  I was introduced to John by a colleague to help solve the problem.  Not only did John introduce me to the investor to solve the issue, but he took himself out of the transaction in an attempt to save the buyer valuable time and create a new relationship for his investor.  Translation= decided to not make any money to better serve the interest of the client.  This is incredibly rare for the industry and a clear indication of where John's priorities are...serving the best interest of the client.  Lastly, John is the president of the company and this sort of leadership flows through an organization, so please consider John, Equinox, and his team of professionals for your home loan.  THANK YOU JOHN!</Review>

We currently did our home refinance with Equinox. I worked with John and his team. They were very professional, prompt, and responsive. The loan process was very easy. He was able to get me a super low rate and cash out on our home. I highly recommend them.<//Text>

<review>I must say I was hesitant in trusting Equinox as I had not heard of the company.  I relied on reviews to determine if I wanted to proceed and I'm so glad I did. The process was seemless and effortless.

Christina...I would like to thank you and your team for working with us on this re-finance. It was nice working with you and your team. I know you weren't working alone and sometimes a group effort doesn't work smooth. It was a little confusing when different members of your group were asking the same questions over and over again. But all in all the results came out fine. I really appreciate Nancy Hoang for keeping everything moving. Lucille Tyson<//Review>

Rates are great however communication was horrendous.  I was quoted one cash to close amount and ended up paying 3x that.  Closing was not well communicated at all.  Attempted twice "last minute"- and never happened.
I would wait up for correspondence after being told one thing, and would not hear from anyone. Very nice people, don't get me wrong. Just a horribly, confusing, experience.<//Review>

Cheers to Archie and Katie for getting the process started and seeing it through to closing. In an increasingly virtual world, the Equinox team made it easy with their software programs and even arranged for a notary to travel to our home when it was time to pen to paper. Very good experience and I have already started to tell me friends and family about Equinox. Thank you!</review></record>

< Review>
I started this refi process in June of 2020. It finally closed in October of 2020. I will give some grace with that as I know everyone and their brother is refinancing right now. The area I was completely frustrated with is the communication from this company. Again, everyone is busy, however, I feel they should be communicating with me about the status of the loan. I found I was mostly the one initiating communication . That isn't acceptable to me. Numbers on the "LOAN ESTIMATE" seemed way off multiple times and I was told "it's an estimate, trust me, go ahead and sign it". It was causing me a lot of anxiety over the whole transaction. I ended up paying 3 months in late fees to my current lender because the process was taking so long. Again, I gave some grace on the time it was taking. The mortgage loan originator offered to reimburse me for those fees which I thought was a very nice gesture. I emailed him the numbers as requested so I could be reimbursed after closing. He did reach out after closing, which I appreciate, asking for the total dollar amount of late fees and my Venmo account information. I emailed the total amount on a Thursday even though I had sent that previously. I was told his boss would send it but to let him if I didn't received it by the end of the day Friday. I did not. I was told to let him know again if I didn't receive it by the end of day Monday and if I didn't he would send it to me out of his account. Nothing on Monday. I was told if I didn't receive anything by end of day Tuesday he would send it to me out of his account. Nothing on Tuesday. I send another email Wednesday. I finally received payment on Wednesday but it was short $7.10. Mind you, I had sent emails twice with the total amount. I will say he got my percent down .25 from what was originally quoted, so I'm grateful for that. The loan is closed and I'm hoping everything is on the up and up and squared away. I'm not 100% confident at this point, time will tell. The person that was sent with the closing documents was just a notary and wasn't able to answer any questions about the document. This was not a good experience. I was left feeling in limbo throughout most of the process.<//Review>

I was looking for a loan on a house I wanted to buy. I looked high and low and everyone seemed to have about the same rate. What made me choose Equinox was the care and consideration they took with my needs. The agents name was Archie and he was really professional. I would definitely recommend Equinox Home Financing.<//Review>

Equinox Home Financing was absolutely phenomenal for my re-financing needs. Katie, who I worked with was so knowledgeable, efficient, always there for me. Extremely polite, and always on the ball. I would highly reccomend this company and Katie for all your home financing needs.< /review>

I originally inquired about a streamline refinance with Anthony Longo. He was easy to talk to, knowledgeable, and attentive. He jumped right on our loan app. He was available for questions thru text and email and responded quickly. After everything started to process we got to speak with Nancy Hoang as our primary loan officer. She kept everything moving to the schedule. We always felt important and at the top of her list.

My credit wasn’t the best when I applied but they were able to find us a Bank that would work with our situation and bring our rate down by almost 2%. We were able to close in a timely manner.

Me and my fiancé are happy we found Equinox to help us with our refinancing needs and will recommend them to anyone in the future!</text>

<review>Just got back from a 10 moth deployment and found a letter from Equinox about refinancing my house. I went from 4.25% to 2.75% and closed in 14 days from the date the application was submitted. I cannot tell you that Kevin Fabian is the most professional employee out there, but far the most I have ever dealt with. The Equinox team is a great team to work with. They call you right back when they miss your call and always provided me with the answers to my questions. I will definitely recommend Equinox to any friend or family seeking the services provided by the company. I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THEM 10 STARS IF I HAD THE OPTION. Thank you Kevin.</review>< Pictures>

Kevin was great from start to finish! He was able to close on a purchase in 30 days with a bank statement loan no other lenders were able to do. His availability, open and honest communication, as well as his industry expertise showed from the start of the application. Thank you for helping make our home dreams a reality! We highly recommend Kevin and his team at Equinox!< /review>

I want to  give a huge shoot out to the Equinox team! They definitely go above and beyond. I have purchased many homes in the past and I have never had the professionalism, fast response, one on one service, and most of all the lowest rate from other lenders. I was able to close in under 20 days ( during the Covid market boom ). Tony, Jessica, Randy, and the owner John definitely won me over. Thank you All. Equinox will always be my lender for purchases and refi.<//review>

John and his team made the process painless! Very easy to talk to. Went above and beyond to make sure I was aware of everything and taken care of. John was always quick to answer any questions I may of had. (I had a lot!)  Because of this we were able to close early! Highly Recommend!!!< /review>

<userid>112269679400265879833< /userid><Review>I reached out a few weeks ago to start refinancing my house. I had spoken with John Doan who sounded very positive about helping my husband and I.  I was sent an electronic portal to sign paperwork and then about a week later, I get an email from Briana saying that our refinance was approved and that I just needed to upload our last two bank statements to the portal previous sent. I have tried calling and emailing Briana multiple times in the last week to make sure everything was received with no response. I copied John on one of the emails to which he replied they would check ASAP - that was 4 days ago!  I have no idea where things stand and there has been ZERO communication. Extremely frustrated at this point. Hoping things look up as it seems many people have had great experiences with John and his team<//Review>< GmapID>

<text>Equinox finance  is great and they closed my second home purchase a week before the deadline. Kevin keeps you up to date and is a true professional. Tells you up front if you qualify and what you need  to get it done. Briana the loan processor really made the final process go smooth and pushed to get the loan processed so we were able to get the keys before thanksgiving.  Thank you Kevin and Briana ! We are going to spend thanksgiving at our second home.<//text><gmapID>0x80dcdbd7fc9c4723:0x3952e385cfcc546c<//gmapID>< Name>

<text>I actually got a lower quote from Flat Branch Mortgage but I chose this company because the agent I was working with was friendly and responsive. That was a bad decision - I almost lost my house. John Doan and his team let me know that they could meet a 30-day closing and due mostly to preventable delays in-house, they were not able to meet the closing and I had to request an extension. Luckily, the seller agreed to an extension of the date that Equinox suggested. That date came around and I was still not able to close on my property and had to request a second extension. Again, it was a good thing that the seller was so understanding because at that point they could have walked away with my earnest money. I spoke to John Doan directly about the issues that I was facing and how I was unsatisfied about the service of his team and he told me he would look into it and get back to me. That was three weeks ago, so I am going to assume that he never looked into it and leave my review now. I have a friend who asked me about my recent purchase and was looking for recommendations to obtain financing on two properties, I will be telling him to go elsewhere than I did.< /text><user_id>107476893955414133927<//user_id><rating>1</rating>< response>

My wife and I contacted Equinox Home Financing and worked primarily with John Doan and his associates. John was very considerate of our mortgage needs and worked very hard with us to obtain our loan in a timely manner. This required a lot of back and forth transfer of information since our home was literally in the process of being constructed from the ground up.
Thanks to John, we were able to get everything accomplished efficiently and the end result is we are now comfortably living in our new home! We have already recommended John to several friends and would not hesitate to work with John Doan and Equinox Home Financing in the future. Thank you very much John for helping us make our dream a reality!<//text>

I have worked with John and his team on several occasions.  They have assisted me with the purchase of two homes and the sale of one.  I have no complaints and was impressed by their knowledge and professionalism.  One thing I would like to mention was how available John was to answer all my questions and concerns.  I remembered calling him as early as 6 am and as late as 9 pm.  If John didn’t pick up right away, he would always return my call within the hour.  I would definitely use the Equinox team again for any future real estate transactions.<//review>

This review is specifically for John Doan. Although I did not end buying a home I am still happy with the way I was treated. John really tried hard to get me approved for a loan and his knowledge was outstanding. I would definitely refer John family and friends or anybody else that would need to get a home loan.<//Text>

Incredible team. Goes above and beyond to make sure that you're taken care of for your home loan needs. They don't present just one option, but look for every other possible avenue as well. I have nothing but great things to say about John and the Equinox team.</review>

As first time buyers we had 101 questions and Thanya Mercado was awesome and always available to answer our questions. We had so many obstacles that got in our way and Mrs. Mercado was always there to calm us down and work with us. She went above and beyond to get us our loan. We would highly recommend Thanya Mercado and Equinox they’re a great team to work with a real blessing. Thanks again for everything!< /text>

<review>They pulled a bate and switch on me. Promised loan with short term funding. It’s been over three months and still no funds and promised 2 week close. I need some of the funds to move to move company and personal things to Chicago for my business. Now I’ve been sitting on edge of my seat to leave to Chicago. This whole time made no personal income and could have been working and moved. They kept promising next week and never has happened up until this point. Do to short of cash and moving out of my home 3 weeks early due to loan docs funding date. “Run for your life from this company.” I’m now sleeping in my car do to their lying and scamming me. They have admitted in writing they had no loan for me.

There are to many details to list.

RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</review>< pictures>

I would just like to start off by saying that my experience with  Exquinox & Mrs. Mercado was amazing. She helped me by educating me about the loan process & what my best options are! I was able to communicate with my loan officer Thanya about all my financial needs & she kept my worries at bay through the process. I definitely recommend working with Thanya, she is so sweet & her customer service is bar none ! Her positivity made this loan come to fruition! Beyond grateful !<//text>

In the beginning of 2016 my daughter became very ill. Mortgage was getting harder to make because of hospital bills. Luckily John Doan who was my loan officer got me approved and went above and beyond to refinance my house! They got m refinance done without having to run credit.  The team always kept me updated and funded within same month of first approving me. Would recommend everyone to Equinox !! not only because of how quickly they finished the loan but just how heart warming they were and truly wanted to help me.<//text>

Agent Kevin Fabian was upset we were having issues gather statements from a closed account. Was sent an email from him saying it looks like too much of pain and not worth his time. Flat out disrespectful and unprofessional on every level.<//Text>

< Review>
Helpful staff and a large selection of many items. I go here for Pokémon. Therefore, the selection can be limited at times due to the recent demand. However, the prices are reasonable and in line with market value. This is definitely my go to when I'm itching for some fresh packs and don't want to wait to get my packs shipped from other sources. Also, they have card savers for grading submissions available by the case of 200 for a very reasonable price. Definitely check this place out if you haven't!</Review>

Great atmosphere for discussing cards. Very trustworthy and reliable guys behind the counter. Come quick because it seems like everytime I go there, their Pokémon ™ boxes and boosters are always flying off the shelves! Beautiful display of cards in the front.

I definitely recommend this place 10/10.<//Review>< pictures>

I went in with my wife and two kids today and this one guy kept following us around and asking if we need help every five to ten minutes literally. We have gone all over the place looking for a new store to shop at. As of recently we had just stopped by five other stores and even my wife said this one was the ONLY one that made her feel completely uncomfortable shopping. I still spent $200 at my visit today however if they had better customer service I would’ve spent more. My wife and I both agree this is the one shop we will not be returning to ever again.<//Text>

POKÉMON FANS BEWARE! They sold me a resealed Alakazam Vbox with resealed vivid voltage packs smh. The box had 2 different types of glue to seal it which is first thing. Next thing is the boosters were extra loose like it was missing a card. Opened gently and saw glue residue, then they had no Holographic. Don’t buy here.</Review>

Large selection of multiple game types. One of a few stores I visit when buying all things D&D and selling MtG cards. Gaming area nice and big but not available cuz Covid. Their sister store is just as good.<//Review>

<Text>Fishy business.
I came in on Saturday and bought 3 packs of Double Masters MTG. Upon opening, the pack broke open. I thought it was weird. Second pack broke open again and in the same spot (right side 1/2” from seam) as the first. I have never had any sealed packs ever break open like this.
I contacted my brother (who had the third pack) and he told me his broke open in the same spot.

All three packs had nothing worth over $1.50 each in cards. Maybe we got unlucky. But either way, I’ve never had packs break open in all the years I’ve collected.</Text><date>1597079260432<//date><name>Spyder One</name><response>None< /response></record>

<Text>Went to the 8:00 P.M. prerelease event for the next Magic the Gathering set. Was glad that they had plenty of time that I was able to make it when I had a busy weekend. Had a great turn out. I really enjoyed my time there. This is the place where I normally buy my singles also.<//Text>< Pics>

<review>I went today to purchase a few board games for my friends and I for game night. I just underwent surgery, so I showed up with crutches. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, definitely went the extra mile. They recommended me some great board games, helped me with getting all the games to my Lyft, and gave me a wonderful first impression of Shuffle & Cut.
Inside, they have an amazing collection of everything from board games to cards. Everything was neatly organized and easy to find. I believe I saw an area in the back where people could play games. I wasn’t in a condition to explore but I’ll definitely be coming back!</review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>This is a hidden gem of a board game and adventure gaming store! It's super-stocked with all types of games - you like Settlers of Catan? Do you have the Game of Thrones version? The Start Trek? Like Escape Room games? They've got all the expansion packs. Ticket to Ride? Europe, France/Wild West, Germany, India/Suiss, and add on expansion packs. Seriously, the staff is super helpful and knowledgeable, and they have board-game tournaments!< /Review>< pics>

<text>This is a good store. If you're into hobby and tabletop gaming, this is a really good local spot.

Parking is a little tight in this shopping center, so keep that in mind if going during prime business ours.

The space has some moderately private gaming rooms.  The selection of board games is VERY good.  The staff is super friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful.  Very clean and well lit spot.

Management is really involved and working to make their store even better.</text>< Pictures>

The staff seemed pretty annoyed to answer my questions or make recommendations. Each visit to shops, we normally drop about $100 to $300 in cards for the fun of doing pack wars at home. I'm not really inclined to drop the money for a sitter for FNM when they can't even answer some basic questions. Sucks, because we live nearby. Guess we'll just go somewhere else.</Text>

<review>I came in a beginner mtg player and the staff was super helpful with helping me build a deck to use in standard play and also helped me find useful cards to add to the commander deck that I am building. I highly recommend this place. The selection is huge the staff is very knowledgable and they provide excellent customer service. I can't wait to try out my new deck! I will definitely going here for my mtg deck building needs. Thank you for a great experience!! :)</review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Shuffle and Cut staff are great. I spotted some out of date stuff and they hooked it up, knowing everywhere else marks it up. They were friendly to me and my wife, as well as willing to share preferences in regards to board games. The environment is cozy, but there was a room in the back where they hosted games. Looking for something board game related, they probably have it.</text>

Had a wonderful experience! We were looking for a particular game at a sister store (with comics) which directed us here, calling ahead and setting aside the game we wanted. Awesome place and incredible staff. Accidently left my card on the counter and the clerk ran out to us to make sure we got it back. So nice.< /text>

This place has an amazing selection of board top games and allows you to bring outside board top games here. And the real kicker to this place is that you can bring your own food here, of course don't get crazy with it<//text>

< Review>
This is a great little game shop. They have the deepest selection of games of any shop I've been to in Orange county. It's a bit hard to find as it's tucked into the back of a business plaza of Lambert in Brea and there are no major cross streets. Just keep in a eye out for the blue sign with white letters. The prices are fair and as I mentioned the selection is second to none. The service is here good. Maybe too good. I once was asked if I was "finding everything ok" 3 times in the span of fifteen minutes, albeit by 3 different people. All in all. Great store!< /Review>

it's a great place to come with some buddies and play yugioh. They have a really nice place where you can chill and enjoy the environment. The people who go their are friendly and would help you out if you need it with your deck. The only draw back i have with this place is the fact that it's pretty far distant where i live. other than that great place.<//Text>

<Text>I called in earlier about a certain card. They had it in stock for 50 dollars in store. Was quoted this price over the phone by employee named Ian. I get the store, and some short chubby rude dude who completely ignored me as I walked in boosted the price up. After I told him I was told another price he didn't care and said price was whatever is on tcgplayer. Then continued to be on his phone and ignored me. This place is joke haha. Never again I was there to spend money as I mentioned to Ian about the cards, deck boxes, and a case of sleeves. Missed out on a nice sale. Some other store will gladly take my money. Not good enough for this cool dude on his phone.< /Text><Name>Eduardo< /Name><pics>None<//pics><Gmap_id>0x80dcd55f17847127:0x201a2a696352eae8< /Gmap_id>< Resp>

I have been to gaming stores up and down the coast of California from Sacramento all the way to San Diego and I can say that this is by far the best store in Cali, restrooms are clean the entire store is organized, the people at the store are the most welcoming community, if you’re looking for a Game store this is definitely the one, it’s pretty much a one stop shop for Yugioh, Pokémon and MTG, they even sell DBSTCG final fantasy and Star Wars, I’ve been going here for years and can definitely vouch for them.<//text>< Pictures>

Shady TCGPlayer seller.  Blocks you for not making large enough transactions to improve their overhead costs of doing business.  Wouldn't be surprised if this sort of attitude likely bleeds into their other business practices.<//Review>

What a great place for boardgames! They not only have a great selection(in alphabetical order, I might add), but this is the cheapest retail game store I've been to. They also have a large game library, where you can try the games before you buy, and they have boardgame night every Wednesday.</Text>

<review>Great game store.  Very clean.  Lots of product, big game room, and huge library of games to play for free.

<response>None<//response><review>Shuffle and Cut is an excellent store for finding new game, and expansions for the most popular games. Because of their size (and prevalence of internet sales), they can't keep a huge backlog of more obscure titles, but they do a good job of rotating in fresh choices and offering solid discounts on products that are being phased out of inventory. They host regular games in the back are of the shop, and the staff is generally friendly.
I wouldn't recommend asking questions about the TCG's on offer, though. They can come across as pretty elitist if you're not up-to-date with the current sets, and seem very dismissive when you ask for info on upcoming league events. I had been considering coming in for some Sealed MtG play, but changed my mind when I couldn't get a straight answer from the employee on-hand about when I'd be able to jump in for a game or two, instead I was given a short "check the website", which in fact didn't help me figure out when or if I'd be able to participate in Sealed play.
All in all, pretty decent shop, I'll probably keep coming back for board games and their expansions, but as far as their TCG game nights are concerned, they don't seem all that interested in bringing in fresh faces, so I'll leave them to it.<//review>< rate>

<text>Their stock of Magic is always pretty good where some niche Yugioh stuff may be harder to find. The staff is friendly and always helpful. They host tournaments for Yugioh Thursday and Saturday, and Magic on Wednesday and Friday. They also have tons of games to try out before you buy.<//text>< user_id>

<Review>Overall the experience was a good one, I should have accepted the staff's help. Still was an experience, and all interactions felt respectful.

Walk in, explore a bit, take a box off the shelf, read the back, put back up, take a book off the shelf read the first three paragraphs of the introduction to the DnD adventure, replace. Explore again, get asked if I want some help (not sure, no thanks). Find Munchkin a good intro to Dnd for unwashed. (IfIRememberCorrectly). First find only muchkin pathfinder, one shelf up are deluxe, and regular. (Should have asked 'bout difference. Didnt; owner/cashier seemed busy)
Okay if friends like munchkin, I should have an extra Dnd Player's Handbook on hand as a loaner. Go back to books pick out my favorite edition PHB, approach the cashier's desk.
Both cashiers are busy, seem to be counting trade in value for a collectable card game. Wait a bit, no one else in store, I'll explore some more. Find calendar on wall, Tuesday Dnd, oh they have a backroom for playing, Thursday M the gathering.
Okay how long are they going to take counting value? Walk up, queue like an American: off to the side so you can learn how trade is done, but at a respectful quiet distance. Cashier says, oh are you going to buy? I can take you over on this side. (Respectful) Cash transaction is fast and painless. Cashier says he likes the choices, "two favorite games" (Good I might want to come back to play in the backroom den)
Ask about a product they don't have in stock, galeforce9 spellcards, (knew gf9 were selling off old stock cleaning market before releasing new decks) told they don't have an ETA on them; were supposed to be released last month (I thought they were holding off release for big dnd stream of annihilation last weekend. Gf9 talk to your stores better)

Overall the experience was a good one, I should have accepted the staff's help. Still was an experience, and all interactions felt respectful.</Review>< pics>

Bel is very rude worst customer experience in my life! I couldn’t hear them because  the landscaper and so I pulled up to the window, they informed me that next time I needed to order at the menu, which I normally do. It just went south from there. I told them to take the coffee I don’t want it and give me a refund. She continued to argue calling me names, shut the window on  Me and even the threatened to call the police! This is the worst experience ever from a Starbucks! Skip this one and go the one inside of Albertsons. Even better skip Starbucks and got to a local store!</review>

<text>Drive thru order taker was friendly and nice. Lots of cars and 1 car order was unusually long, but after that person everything went smoothly. Used coffee mugs as a no contact drink hand off, interesting. Overall from order to hand off quick drive thru.< /text>< resp>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Truly the best Starbucks I’ve ever stepped foot into! This place was the best part about my short stay in Palm Springs. Stacies and Charmaine’s customer service is unmatched, plus the team works fast. I’ve never had to wait anything over 3 minutes max for my orders - which were usually 2 or 3 drinks at a time. They’re always super nice to my dog too and offer her pupaccinos and hugs everyday ( HUGE BONUS FOR ME or any pet owner).
We love you guys! Thank you for everything and please don’t ever change.💕🌵< /Text><user_name>Rochelle Shvam<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

Update I tried at 430 am lol they said they sold out of all sandwiches except one in the thirty seconds they were open. Oh and if I want the one they only accepting starbucks gift cards or cash rite now lol... If it wasn't for the great friendly staff I would never be back I wonder how much revenue is lost at this location due to insufficient  inventory and systems malfunction etc...

I'll keep trying and give up update on when I finally get my sandwich.... ⏳< /review>< Pictures>

It was a little busy just because I was 5 cars behind.

Don’t bother trying to purchase merchandise on release day. Managers have fist pick then employees, then Drive-Thru then they open the doors. I have video I’m sending to corporate. Employees here used to care about the customer or the customer experience but ever since COVID the employees only care about the employees.< /Review>

<review>The night crew decided that they "were getting too many orders" and locked the doors at least 15 minutes early. So we tried to go through the drive through instead.. Got to the speaker just in time for them to say, sorry, we are closed.

This is the second time, second location, we have run into a Starbucks crew closing early with rude customer service!! This one takes the Cake though.. the first time, employees just pretended they didn't see anyone. This time, the employee was flat out rude.< /review>< Rating>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Great place to go gave some excellent coffee. I go there sometimes when I need to get some caffeine and a charge for my phones. I am always treated well, and I've never had a bad experience there. One thing that was different about my last visit is that they had a little coffee tasting event. There weren't many people in the restaurant at the time, so it was convenient to to move around the table that was prepared for this interesting little event. I wish I could remember the name of the employee that put on the presentation. He was very informative and thorough in his description of the way this specific type of coffee was produced and prepared. Although all of that information is lost on me. (I just want strong coffee). He was very enthusiastic and energetic the whole way through. I don't think I had been in a Starbucks more than a handful of times before I came back to town a few months ago, but I really enjoy my visits to this one in particular. Great job Starbucks!< /review><date>1561418465152<//date><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

They are tasty, made to perfection.

Cleanliness; 4-5 stars
It’s hard to keep it clean with some many homeless coming in and out. So I understand.

Customer service; 2 stars
Customers are waiting in line and no employees say “well help you in a minute “, acknowledge customers, after all if no customers there’s no paychecks, no jobs, customers are the reason this place stays open for business. It’s not hard for staff members to simply say “well be there in a minute”., I have my Starbucks App but I prefer human interaction but when I see this neglected line  OR see this staff member on register “Gas attendant” personality I prefer to order online.

Time waiting; 0-1 star
It’s been more than few times I have waited up to 13 minutes (almost 15 min) for a drink., wether I order it upfront or online.

I would totally suggest to put their Aces in their places..
To fully stock and have extra backup for each shift.... elevate yourself and the team.

Just my suggestion.<//text></record></dataset><record>
<Rate>5</Rate><text>Busy place! Looks small from the outside but it's roomy on the inside. I like the outdoor side patio a lot; it's generally quieter there. The service is friendly and they work as quickly as they can! Been there a few times now, and my order is always done right.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Time>

Starbucks is Starbucks and this one was typical. Their service was sort of slow even though the order was made and paid online. Also, since I was picking up for someone in the nearby rehab center, the drink was on one end of the counter and the other stuff, which I had to ask for, was on the other side. How they can keep up with things, I don't know but I suspect a lot of "leakage"...
However if you have to satisfy your Starbucks fix, this place is as good as any as long as you're not in a hurry.< /text>

Great place, but I never get the reward points for purchase... the cashier (older gentleman) thinks hes slick lol no big deal. I'll reload before going in because other than that issue everything is amazing here. Everyone ELSE..
Is always on point.< /Review>

Very busy Sbux - lots of seniors + younger folks, too. Staff is friendly. Usual selection of Sbux food items & merchandise. At the busy intersection of S Sunrise & E Ramon. Near Mizell Senior Center & PS Public Library. At stop for #30 bus; walkable to stop for #s 14 + 24 (by Library). Small patio w/ nice view of mountains to the W. Many bakeries & restaurants right here, incl. SW corner of Ramon.< /Text>

Gary, my barista
(from now on),
not only welcomed me as a new customer he also demonstrated his unique qualities as he prepared my wife's libation, you see he is my wife's Barrister also.
Not really a surprise as my wife is extremely 'interested' in the creation of her drink.
If you get my drift.
Thanks Gary.
We'll see you in the morning.
Dennis and Denise Bennett
and kitty too.</review>

The 50 Cent refill a regular coffee is the deal of the day everyday FYI! The staff are super friendly and the place is neat and clean it's the best spot in DHS for a quick coffee or snack. Food is excellent.<//Review>

Long lines short of help no eye contact and no greeting from cashier. Drinks are always good. Parking is very difficult as parking lanes are only one way no drive-thru. If you're in a hurry trying another Starbucks. If you're not in a hurry this one's good for you.< /Review>

Typical Starbucks with a drive-thru. Excellent staff though and a decent amount of seating/tables inside with a small patio outside. Parking in this shopping center (Sunrise Plaza) is hard to find and with only two entrances/exits for the entire shopping center there is a lot of traffic. Drive-Thu if you can but be prepared for long lines of cars.< /text>

<text>I went in to get coffee pods, I went to the cashier and asked for help since I didn't see them. She said she would gladly get someone to help me and rushed me out of the way before I had a chance to finish my order. I was happy to wait and did for 5 minutes. I saw the lady that was supposed to help me but she was too busy to help me so I left.</text><GmapID>0x80db1b765bc2b119:0x44d90f40dfd596b3< /GmapID>< username>

I had to reorder and pay twice for my drink because the Barista (Gary) placed my order incorrectly after I had corrected him. He seemed angry and was very rude. We all have bad days, but come on Starbucks! You guys can do better.</Text>

Excellent location near Sunrise park and Ralph's  cross street barista near  Ramon password required for bathroom usage I have a strong recommendation that bike racks be installed and more battery charging apparatus be added.  Great coffee affordable .<//text>

Very busy Sbux - lots of seniors + younger folks, too. Staff is friendly. Usual selection of Sbux food items & merchandise. At the busy intersection of S Sunrise & E Ramon. Near Mizell Senior Center & PS Public Library. At stop for #30 bus; walkable to stop for #s 14 + 24 (by Library). Small patio w/ nice view of mountains to the W. Many bakeries & restaurants right here, incl. SW corner of Ramon.< /Text>

Was in drive thru at 5:20 a.m. and a tall curly haired woman barista decided it was good customer service to get mad at me bc I asked for a  vente water after ordering a vente coffee and banana bread. I am an Uber driver, I frequent SB regularly and I have never been treated like I was being rude for requesting a cup of h2o. I will not come to this SB again.<//review>

Not only can you not get the full amount of a drink you paid for but you can’t even get a functioning cup. Twice.

<Review>This well managed Starbucks is a beehive of activity...morning noon and night. The employees are friendly and well-trained, knowledgeable, and hard-working. The shop is clean, the food and coffee top-notch, and the people watching is exemplary. The drive-thru is fast, the outdoor patio is serene, and the general manager of this location works her tail off. This location is worth a visit any day of the week. You can order with your mobile app, or the drive-thru, or in-person at the store. It’s one of the best!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

< Review>
This is the worst Starbucks! Every time we come here my drink(s) somehow come out wrong. I went in today and I asked for a grande skinny iced  cinnamon dolce latte with almond milk and my boyfriend orders a iced vanilla latte. He gets his in under 10 minutes. I go up to check on mine 5 minutes later and I don’t see it so I go and sit back down. 5 minutes later I go back up to wait for my drink and I watch the barista scrape off the whipped cream to one of the drinks (that I noticed was sitting there before) and put it back on the counter. Guess who’s name he called out! You got it! The lactose free person. I normally wouldn’t make it such a big deal but we came here last week and our drinks were watered down and the iced vanilla latte tasted like the just colored some milk and put it in a cup. We’re done with this Starbucks.< /Review>

Remodeled in the last two years, this Starbucks has an incredibly large café with ample seating. As with any Starbucks, the am rush can be a tad overwhelming. The staff is always friendly!< /review>

This Starbucks customer service is generally good,  people are very friendly but they are soooooo slow! You can tell they focus on getting drinks through the drive through faster as there are always 4 to 5 people on drive through  and 1 maybe 2 for the inside which is ALWAYS packed... Seriously,  takes at least 10 minutes to get 1 drink, it's bad...< /review>

<Text>I will never return to this particular Starbucks. In the drive thru I  ordered a venti frappaccino with an extra shot of espresso. I asked if they could put it in a larger cup since there would be more beverage due to the extra shot. When I got to the window the employee rudely made it clear they would never do that again. I asked what they do with the overflow. He said they discard it.
They would rather throw out perfectly good beverage than give me a larger cup. Rude people. I will drive 1 mile south to the Starbucks in Ralph's on Palm Canyon before I ever return to this store. I also will never recommend the store to anyone. Not the first time they've been rude. The baristas at Ralph's (Palm Canyon) are the best. Always friendly. Always consistent.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80db1b765bc2b119:0x44d90f40dfd596b3<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This is a very popular very beautiful modern redone Starbucks. It's occupied  by the Clones who dwell in Palm Springs with their feelings of intitlement and their attutudes, very stuck up phony people. The staff who work there are fantastic they work very hard for a very difficult crowd of customers. It's a good place to stop have a drink and leave.Not a family place for sure. I don't like to mingle in that particular Starbucks.< /review>

Edit: LOBBY OPENS AT 5am, NOT 4:30!!! Drive thru only!!!< /text>< Pictures>

I'm honestly one to never complain but I'm so tired of always getting my frappes so watery. Today I finally asked my barista to kindly add more ice to mine because I ordered a frappe not an iced drink she did but I got it back the same even more watered down. If I were to ask for extra ice my drinks always have no type of flavor even after I order with extra peppermint. I don't know why but it's always at this time I go my drinks are not good. There's this one barista that makes the best drinks but I don't know her name. Once I find out I'll definitely write a review on her. She's the best!< /text>

<date>1523103912397</date><Rating>2< /Rating><text>As Starbucks goes, this is one of my least favorite - after Bermuda Dunes. The A Team staff works mornings, come in after 4 or 5 and good luck. I wanted a bag of decaf beans, there's none in outer display. I ask for help, a young guy, who admits he doesn't drink or know coffee, tries to help but can't find it. Says sorry, and just walks away. There's no one in the lobby and no other staff around. He actively has to ignore me. Usually (in other stores), a barista will weigh out beans from what they're serving finished coffee pouring. You know, like how Starbucks originated, selling coffee beans and the occasional cup? Not this place. I quit asking to get my regular beans weighed out from their stock - it's fresher than what's prebagged. It causes way too much stress on the staff, operating a scale while pouring a silver bag of beans into a bowl. And I can only take so many eye rolls from a 30 year old in pigtails and multiple piercings. Starbucks....you've forgotten what your base followers loved about you.... Damn good coffee beans. Why would you make it so difficult for me to give you money for something you make? Go to this place mornings only for your half soy, double whip, 12 pumps sugar free vanilla, 3 pumps classic, no foam Grande in a Venti cup. Pretty cups of overpriced nonsense, that  they can do, measure a bean? The struggle is real.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80db1b765bc2b119:0x44d90f40dfd596b3<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I like this place because it's close to my appartment.  I usually go early to avoid the homeless.   Service is ok.  Severe homeless problem and drug addicts hang around for free waters and panhandling.  None of them buy anything and take up all the lounge seating.   If you complain the textbook answer is " they don't pay me enough to deal with it".    Once they leave the place is a mess.  At times I don't feel safe there.<//Text>

t's been about the 3rd time my mobile has been taken. The last time I waited over 10min asked the barista and showed him my mobile receipt and said he didn't have it. I asked him if i could just refund it back since I was in my lunch. He told me to wait, he remade the drink... it was awful, I ended up throwing it away</Text>

Very rude staff. Long wait because the baristas are to slow.
I made a line on the drive thru walk in to use restroom and the front desk person wanted me to get on the line of 10 people for a.code,
I  walked to the grocery store. Regret stopping here<//text>

Friendly service!  The Baristas are  always friendly, smile & willingness to help and make suggestions and service is great. Unfortunately due to some of the past individuals frequenting the coffee house, Starbucks was forced to do away with most of the comfortable cushoned chairs, due to these induviduals "campung out" all day and taking up seating that should have been used by paying customers.
The coffee house is always spotless and comfortable.
The only thing that disturbs me is the number of people who seem to come in the morning and stay all day . . and don't order . . just take up the comfy chairs that paying customers would like to enjoy while they sip there coffee and enjoy a fresh role or bagel.< /review>

Same reason as below. They took out most of their outlets.... bad starbucks.   Seems to be a trend in Palm Springs though.  Koffi downtown did the same thing.  But staff seems to be ok.  Come in if you only want coffee.<//text>
