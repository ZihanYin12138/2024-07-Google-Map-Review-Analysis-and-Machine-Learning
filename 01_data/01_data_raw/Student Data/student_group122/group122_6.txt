<rate>1</rate><text>My neighbor and I went to the food bank as we have done several times prior to this. Usually the person on duty likes to have a chat with us before we get to the food. This is usually a calm and respectful representation of our beliefs, my friend is a Christian, I'm not. This has never been a problem before today. Today a person named "Kevin" (He refused to provide his full name.) walked outside with us asked if we attended services there, and when he was informed we don't, he accused us of being "enemies" and refused to even mention the reason we came. After informing him I was not pleased with being characterized as being an "enemy," he hightailed it back into the office. I followed, and a gentleman whom we've dealt with before came out and more or less apologized for his co-worker's lack of tact. Having a person like "Kevin" working with the public reflects very poorly on your organization. I would like to receive a written apology for the way this person treated us simply because my beliefs do not correspond with his own. If receiving food from the food bank is conditional, that should be clearly stated to all of the organizations you are affiliated with who supply your food bank.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Anyone and everyone is welcome pastor Jeff Jonson is a great person. The service is gods word and you can feel his presence. The live band really helps you to praise the lord. They have children's class so you can focus on the word of God. And they have an over flow room with privacy glass and sound if you have little ones you just can't leave you're side. Like I said everyone is welcome. I have been attending Calvery downy for 3 years. With my wife and our 5 kids. - God bless< /text>

Love the staff, except for a young lady named Monica at the cafe. Y'all need to reassess her, because she's the only one there that consistently gives bad service. However the staff, teachers, volunteers, and pastors are nice.< /review>

When we moved to the area we searched for a Good Christain church and 1st tried Calvary Chapel Downey. We were impressed with Pastor Jeff Johnson so much that we decided to stay and we've been there almost 2 years now. He's a Good Man of God and he tells us as Christains how we should be living our lives for the Lord. He's not afraid to tell us like it is and he ALWAYS teaches from the Bible and ALWAYS teaches how to be Saved so that if you aren't Saved, he will tell you how You can be with God some day. We couldn't ask for a better church. We are Very Happy we went to Calvary first. We found a home in Calvary Chapel of Downey. If you haven't been here then PLEASE just try it once. You just might walk away with Many, Many Blesssings! God Bless!<//text>

i love the church but went to the cafe and the girl there monica was very rude to me and i wondered if i was at the anarchy library down the street,lol...no they are much more polite there !! i was driving by gotham bar and grill back in the 90"s and i had a wonderful compliment from people there but these are pagan hang outs....while at the cafe after being insulted by monica,no i wasn't offended by the man seated across from me who's buttocks were showing while i was trying to eat so i struck up a conversation with him,he claimed to be a member of the church,so i stated to him brother "ur butt checks are exposed and there are people here around us trying to ignore it...i can't ignore it, i apologize..pull up your shorts,please....between the cashier monica and the butt checks guy who is a member"i think i need to tell some body or i need to go to a new church....i can only say that this has been building up for some time now ....i can remember when i was a young teen 13 years old, a guy came to our house he was interested in my sister starr,and he said star lets go to calvary chapel downey its the best church I've ever gone to,and lets take your brother and sisters...he continued "pastor jeff is the most awesome guy you've ever seen preach you'll be agreeing with me after we come back...so we pulled up in the dirted drive way and i saw my first christian rock band and a younger pastor jeff celebrating the christian rock new era..i was taken by total surprise as most people were,I'm ashamed to say that appearance is losing its vitality...i was in mens prayer and brother jeremiah at table 9 told me i was offensive in my celebrating the lord with a shout of jesus,i read some where that it is not out of the ordinary to be so happy that many are joined in jesus the son of god,while i sat there the same brother"that caused me this dismay also was selling necklaces in the church temple for 10 dollars....hmmm it goes on the list of condemners yet condemnation is the lords...i asked brother ricky if he could help me assist some people from victory outreach west lake trying to get victory outreach in dove tail food pantries and he was angered by by persistence,we are told at the dove tail food pantry that they welcome church's like victory outreach to attend the stock crews from many other church's at dove tail such as praise chapel,sunshine church and many different type of rehabilitation institutes and or organizations..i found a new church in another county i again am ashamed of calvary chapel downey....im 50 yrs old this month...i was 13 when i first walked on this darted road in the 70's...good bye calvary chapel downey...i love u pastor jeff< /review>

< Review>
Started Calvary Chapel Downey in 1979. Spoke with Pastor Jeff Johnson, told him I was new, loved the depth of his messages, needed class for my developmentally challenged daughter, sadly there was none. So we prayed, 3 mos later I started  "Special Kids Sunday School". I've taught special children & adults for 35yrs!
I highly recommend Calvary Chapel Downey, you LEARN God's word expositionally (verse by verse), they provide CHILDREN's MINISTRIES from infant care, toddlers, pre-school thru high school. Teachers are dedicated, teaching the WORD to children!!
If you're looking for a church that provides any/all these ministries come on OVER!!<//Review>

<review>Was shocked to see employee outside, leaning against the wall, coughing and spitting.  My son went inside to order.  I waited in the car and saw this employee hacking, coughing non stop.  He was spitting.  Watched this for about 5 minutes.  He then went back inside to work.  I got out of my car to tell Manager that this employee should be sent home.  I witnessed how sick he was.  No Manager came to talk to me, and the employee continued working, coughing the same. I told my son to leave his order and we left.  Disgusting that they would allow an employee to work that sick.<//review>< Resp>

<review>This burger king is a joke. Average time to get your food 10-15 minutes. While I’m waiting they leave the food out. By the time it’s given to me it’s cold. The people here never ever get an order right not only do they have me waiting they also didn’t get my order right. This establishment is ran by people who don’t care about the customer experience.< /review>< Pictures>

Not an awful Burger King. Service and speed are usually very good here. At times it can get slow though, so be aware of that when you arrive. Orders tend to be accurate most of the time as well, so this is a good place to stop without too much concern over getting the wrong order.</text>

I work with door dash and the order was placed online so it should have been ready by time I got there but no I've been waiting for 30 min and counting! The person taking the orders is so slow and the staff making the food are arguing back and fourth with each other this is just unacceptable!<//text>< pics>

The King has done it again!!  Best tasting Mocha Frappé I've purchased in a long time-- ( Starbucks watch out!). Rich deep roast coffee flavor without overpowering sweetness. Iced Mocha but with a smoothness that keeps you craving for another.  Expecting to cool down this Summer with this delicious tasting Frappé.  Ohhh,  Tourists will remember this one long after they're back home.</text>

<Name>Ben Ramirez<//Name><Text>Awful service. Went through the drive through, was told to park in front and they will take me my order. It happens so ok, but 15 minutes passes by. So I go inside and they haven't even started my food! I was going to run late for work so I told him to give me a refund. He refused and told the girl to make my order. He tried offering me a cup for a free drink. Then my sandwich came out missing bacon, then he almost forgot my hash browns. That was ridiculous.</Text>< Gmap_id>

Most times they get your order right but when they get it wrong they really get it wrong. All the way up to burned patties. The good news is that they make it right when you say something about it.</review>

The person took an order, took payment and filled that order at the window, before taking another order. There were five cars lined up at a time.<//Text>

On Nov. 11th 8:10 pm I ordered from the drive through. I didn't get what I ordered so I took the food inside. The Manager walked outside with me to see the sign of what I ordered. Plane as day two for $6 mix and match, with a big picture of the food. She tells me that what I ordered was not a two for six item, when it shows it on the BIG picture. I got my money back, but should have gotten what the sign shows.
I wish I could ould give less the one star rating. POOR management.
Won't go back.</text>

I would like to challenge all of the negative reviews in here.. The employees are welcoming and friendly, the food and service here is great and the managers aspire to motivate their employees on a daily basis.< /text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The hamburgers and the potatoes were very cold, they did not give me the order, because I asked for some onion rings, they did not have them and they went to bring them from another store, the place was disgusting, there were no napkins, I finally asked them to return my Money because they didn't give me the full order, I don't know I recommend them, I don't go back to this place.

Las hamburguesas y las papas bien frías, no me entregaban la orden,  porque pedí unos aros de cebolla, no tenían y los fueron a traer de otra tienda, el lugar estaba hecho un asco, no había servilletas, finalmente les pedí la devolución de mi dinero porque no me dieron la orden completa, no sé los recomiendo, no vuelvo a este lugar.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Officer Maxwell responded to a call for which I was involved in. Let me tell you guys, he’s the most humble officer I’ve came across. If it wasn’t for last nights encounter I would of given this post 1 star. There was also another officer that responded but I didn’t catch his name. He was nice too.
No disrespect to any officers but most of them are very cold and rude.<//review>

When someone dies in Escondido and police are called, the police do not even bother informing the next of kin, even when that information is known to them. Completely incompetent and unprofessional. Immoral, actually.<//text>

Officer from escondido police department was unprofessional. 911 dispatcher was unprofessional. The responding officer's supervisor was unprofessional when we called to complain about his officer not doing his job correctly. He was defending his mistakes. I personally do not feel like we are protected by these people wearing badges. The only professional people were the fireman that responded to the accident. They new exactly what was going on with the situation. The driver that hit the car was under the influence and the officers did not catch it. But he left his drugs on the side of the road for the escondido police department to have to come back to pick up! Truly Disappointing!
NO SOBRIETY TEST was COMPLETED he got away driving under the influence!< /text>

Very polite and professional! Their phone system could have been designed a bit better, but other than that, I had an excellent experience. Never had anything but generally good experiences with EPD;</review>

<review>This review does not reflect the officers. It reflects the Hiring process. The hiring process is very vague in emails. If you are in the military do NOT APPLY. They won't even accept you for the written test unless you are a civilian. They do Not tell you before hand, they do Not tell you in the emails, they tell you AFTER you WASTE your time getting there and SIT down to TAKE the test. They said you're Instantly Disqualified.
Dear Escondido fix your system so you don't Waste someone's time especially the Military  Members who have to fight to get time off and who want to continue serving other after they're contract is up. If you only want people who only have time for waiting around be more specific in your job description.
Also, I DO NOT want a reply from you regarding this matter. Thanks ✌️<//review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80dbf33da7c597ed:0x25205604028e4c77< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<user_name>Matuts Bansil</user_name><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Review>I have lived in different countries and different states when my husband was an active military. Most of the officers in those countries and states are very approachable, humble and concerned. I live in Escondido for 9 years now and times that I have seen and encountered police officers here. I’ve seen how rude and disrespectful they are. They feel entitled and feel that they have more of an advantage with everything because they think they have power. If not for my kids school, We would have moved for a long time now. EPD are the most racist based on what I’ve seen and experience. They do generalize people by race, very prejudice as well. I guess you gotta be white for them to respect you. Such a sad city to live in. When the people you think will protect you and respect are the ones who makes you feel not protected.<//Review><rate>1< /rate><time>1557284626310<//time><Response>None< /Response></record></dataset><record>

<Text>THERE IS ONE OFFICER AT ESCONDIDO POLICE DEPT THAT IS A CONSUMMATE PROFFESSIONAL. He brings honor back to the badge. He is officer Fidel. He is polite, kind, respectful, non judgemental, helpful, expresses genuine human reguard for people (no matter what monetary class theyre from)  In my opinion he should be teaching at the academy.<//Text>< Pics>

<text>Officers and Admin personnel take things personal. You can't serve a community when you let your own issues get in the way. It's unhealthy for the community.

Called to ask for guidance and Admin person was rude and had an attitude. She was bothered that I called and probably interrupted her nap.</text>< pics>

There were not very nice to me.  A few month ago I went to McDonald in Escondido and I was wear short shorts and I am a guy and they told me to put pants on.  First of all girls where short shorts so guy should be able to do the same.  Also I wore the same short Shorts at the San Marcos Library and they did not care.<//Review>

<rating>5<//rating><text>I have to give thanks to the man who answered my recent call to the non emergency # regarding my issue with no one at Rincon Water replying to my pleas for help to get my water main turned off to repair a leak.

Unfortunately.... they sent out a water dept employee to help me and he was very nice & did his best to get my water main turned off but,  was unable to do so.  I am a Rincon water customer - Daniel is an employee for Escondido Water Dept :(  I really do appreciate what you tried to do Daniel.

My water main is located in my neighbors front yard buried in the ground and bolted shut by Rincon water. I am a single woman with medical issues and  limited resources, exactly how am I going to get my water main turned off ?
36+ hours later and I finally get a real person from Rincon on the phone who then states for him to come turn my water off - He will charge me $100 to start with.
Such a Shame that Rincon Water chooses to allow water to continue to run uncontrolled instead of doing the right thing and help save our natural resources

How can I change water departments from Rincon to Escondido ?< /text>< Pictures>

I just watched the Michael Crowe story and I was shocked to see how the police tortured that dear little boy. Unfortunately any man or men that act like that surely feel no remorse for their actions. I know one thing that I will never set foot in Escondido California for fear of becoming a scapegoat for what ever crime happened that day. I will remember the names of those officers to protect myself from them. Such evil in a department that is supposed to protect its citizens.</text>

I understand it is their job to assist us, but when a person is so cordial, knowledgeable and helpful I feel I need to point that out.

Rest In Peace Stephanie Carroll, Escondido Police failed you miserably and broke the law to force a confession  from your brother, a child. The gross incompetence of the da and the pd let your real killer, who was covered in your dna and reported to be lurking outside your house by neighbors, go free. Shame on this disgusting office, that would  allow an obvious murderer to go free Bc they would rather torture obviously innocent children until they confess. Everyone needs to study the case of Stephanie Carrol- to keep themselves safe from corrupt and negligent police and D.As. They could try to frame your child next.<//Review>

<review>I am generally not a fan of the EPD for reasons I am not going to list here. Suffice it to say that police work isn't what it was when my grandfathers were police officers. Back then, innocent people were the good guys and crooks were the bad guys. Now there seems to be no difference. Anyway, on June 8, 2014, I called the police because a girl who had been staying with me had stolen about $1,000 worth of my stuff. Officer C. Moore responded and he was very kind and empathetic. He helped me as best he could and even drove around to find her car because she was stalking me and members of my family. My opinion of the EPD was raised significantly and now I have hope for the world.<//review>< pics>

It's a good place especially if you are looking for Mexican products. But some of the butchers are very rude. They always want to give you whatever they want. I like to tell them how a want it (For example: If I want to buy pork chops, they give you boneless and I like it to have bone) And when I ask them they get annoy. They tell me to take it that way. They aren't giving me anything for free. They don't have to have a bad attitude toward the customers. Isn't the customer always supposed to be right?< /review>

Very cramped inside. Went to buy some produce and also bought an ice cream. Ice cream counter workers were very slow and uninterested in what they were doing.</Review>

I visited Mercado El Rey yesterday to buy pork feet for pozole. The butcher was super friendly and answered all my amateur cook questions about meat cuts and what else they offer (goat, offal, tendon, etc.) and gave me a delicious sample of some spicy and delicious ceviche from the deli. Meat prices were good, lots of spices, veggies/fruits, and Mexican/Central American snacks.< /text>

As they have better food, I'd rather support them instead. Fruits and vegetables are nearly unbeatable. There is Mexican ice cream here that seems popular and the prepared foods counter is also delicious. Support them and you won't regret it.</text>< name>

Good produce, meat, groceries.. but they also have ready made food! Don't love SOME of the check out girls though.. if I didn't get attitude and ignored while she spoke to another worker there (BTW.. I speak Spanish! Never assume!) & pretty much threw my change in my hand... I may have given it 5 stars!
UPDATE: Went back and a new (I believe) check out girl was as nice as can be AND the already marinated meat for tacos Al Pastor was BOMB!! I'm going back! 😁<//Text>

I grew up in the ghetto and this place is the closest thing to the mexican market that I grew up with. This place is clean, friendly and the deals on al pastor and chicken are un beatable. The pollo loco and the al pastor are so tasty and flavorful. This is my go to!</Text>

Great produce and meat market. It's a perfect mercado with produce at a price you won't believe. This is where I go when I want to make salsa or chile verde.</review>

I just moved to Lake Forest from LA where I am spoiled with amazing mexican marts like El Super, El Superior & North Gate. I found this place on Yelp/Google and the reviews were good. But my experience was horrible. The service was pretty horrible, and the guy are the carnicera purposely ignored me  (although I was thier first with no one else around) as soon as a hispanic gentleman walked up. It was unfortunate. The workers even talked trash about me in spanish and I am 85% fluent in spanish. It was almost like a caucasian female never stepped foot in that market before. The prices were okay, nothing comparable to the markets I am used too. I wouldnt go again, their service was unlike anything I have ever experience in a Mexican Mart before. Truly sad.</review>

(Translated by Google) Very bad experience they have gone several times since we bought Hawaiian and they barely put honey on it almost nothing I decided to ask for extra inside and outside no matter the price I just want it as I like it and the last 2 times they gave me honey outside but the third time I asked them the same inside and one side outside they charged me for .95 cents which is fine I did not mind paying but when I got home the honey did not come in the bag that disappointed I was ... when I opened my fruit and they had not put honey inside it was dry some strawberries in bad condition :( what a bad service that disappointment I will return to the champion one star because there is no less :(

(Original)
Muy mala experiencia ya van varias veces que compramos hawaiana y apenas le ponen miel casi nada decidi pedir extra adentro y afuera no importa el precio solo la quiero como me gusta y las 2 últimas veces me dieron afuera la miel pero la tercera les pedí igual adentro y un side afuera me lo cobraron por .95 centavos lo cual esta bien no me importó pagar pero llegando a mi casa no venia la miel en la bolsa que decepcionada quedé...cuando  abri mi fruta y tampoco le habían puesto Miel  adentro estaba seca algunas fresas en mal estado:( que mal servicio que decepción me regresare al campeón una estrella por que no hay menos :(< /Text>

<rating>2< /rating><review>(Translated by Google) The good news is the following: You find products from Latin America, variety and assortment.
The bad: products more expensive than elsewhere, about 15% or 20% higher in price.
In conclusion: You can buy one or another product that we really want to get, but I do not recommend it to buy the basic basket at home.

(Original)
Los bueno es lo siguiente: Encuentras productos de latino América, variedad y surtido.
Lo malo : productos más caros que en otros lados, aproximadamente 15% o 20% más elevado el precio..
En conclusión:  Se puede comprar uno que otro producto que realmente queramos conseguir,pero no lo recomiendo como para comprar la canasta básica de casa.< /review>< pics>

<review>We take both of our vehicles to Ripon Auto for oil changes and for car repairs.  They are professional and honest.   They always communicate what is wrong and an estimate on repairs before starting a job.  They have also gotten repairs done quickly and in a timely manner.  I highly recommend their services.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Review>Honest and professional.  Prices are very fair.  Performed scheduled maintenance on my Subaru.  Also installed a new battery in my Chevy 2500HD.  Only charged for the battery. No labor.  Then on a separate visit, they checked out the cooling system on my Subaru. No charge again.  Good folks.< /Review>< Pics>

Took my 2010 Charger to them as it was idling really rough and the check engine light came on/off a few times. Adam there let me know they did the same thing I did and checked for codes and nothing came up. Asked them to then go ahead and change the oil and give it a once over. When it was ready to go pick up was expecting a much larger bill than I got. They are fantastic! Will definitely be taking my car and my husband's truck there from now on.< /review>

Took in my 06 Duramax for repairs.  These guys did a great job. The final cost was a bit less than what they quoted. How often does this happen. Honesty in a repair shop goes a long way. Truck was done and ready when they said it would be. Good to know there is still an auto repair shop that you can trust to be honest and complete the repairs on time. Thank you Ryan for taking care of the AC issue when I picked up my truck and Adam for explaining the details and process of the repairs completed.<//review>

I only had a transmission flush and a first look at a traction control issue that came up, but I always have my repairs done here.  Adam is always helpful and won't oversell anything.</text>

Dependable. Trustworthy. Reputable. Efficient. Thorough. I hope I never need to take my cars elsewhere. We moved an hour away and still this is the only shop we use for our vehicles. Ralph did good.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

I have serious trust issues after years of auto places trying to scam me. Ripon auto has been honest, very reasonable and does excellent service . I have had my car serviced 3 or 4 times now. I won't be going anywhere else!< /review>

I've always had great service from Ripon Auto. They listen to me when I tell them what is wrong with my cars. I use an OBD11 monitor to get the codes I need to diagnose my car problems. They even take my new parts that I've bought and put them into my car. Not all service department will do this.  There's guys are very good at what they do. I highly recommend Ripon Auto for servicing and getting your car back on the road again! 😊</Review>

<text>Very honest and resonable. My truck was shutting off randomly. Had my truck towed to the shop. They found the ecm module was defective and replaced my ecm. I have not had any issues since.
Thank you Adam and your team.<//text>< Pics>

Dead battery and this battery is not where it’s supposed to be!! Chrysler 300m 😳
I go to get my car and ask about the charges
“No charge”
“What?”
“You replaced your battery last year so we are not charging you”.
Not for installing either!!
Great team there, great service Too!</review><gmap_id>0x80904500327fb8d1:0x53361da86076842e</gmap_id><Pics>None<//Pics></record></dataset><record>

I'm in my vehicle on the go everyday, with all of my kids and their activities. Having a safe dependable vehicle is so very important. Mechanics is something I'm not familiar with, so it's always nice to not feel taken advantage of. When I walk in there I know I can trust whatever work they do will not be subpar. I feel trust is very important when it comes to your mechanic. We've always taken our vehicles to Ripon Auto, and we ALWAYS will. I recommend them to everyone!!<//Review>

Adam was great to work with.   Maintenance done on our car was done competently and for a very fair price.  what I really appreciate is the temporary fix they made on our heater while we contemplate a longer-term solution. Great job!<//Review>

<date>1561342411180<//date><review>I went in last week that my aging 10 yr old SUV was going to need some pretty significant repair including a rear engine seal.  The car started acting up right after the last oil change including a leaking rear engine seal.  The oil change was done at a quick lube place.  Come to find out the quick lube place added double the oil that my car is supposed to have.  It was leaking out just to get rid of the pressure.  Ripon Auto Repair could have charged me for a rear seal and all sorts of other things but they didn’t. They diagnosed the problem changed the oil and checked the rear seal and did not have to fix anything.   Excellent work< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Name>Robert Orantes<//Name><date>1547236046871<//date><Rate>5<//Rate><text>First time at Ripon Auto, very happy with the results. I expressed my concerns with my corvette and they looked into it as well.
They called back shortly there after to inform me of issues, which I expressed with them earlier. Which involved moving parts around in order to repair. The front crank cover gasket and seal it was leaking oil and getting all over the exhaust. While they were in that segment of the engine they also replaced the water pump and the original harmonic balancer and belts.
So far no leaks, however I can still smell a bit of hot oil when stopped at a red light. That may be some old oil not burned off yet..Not really sure, apperantly you can’t steam the under carriage of any vehicle in the San Joaquin valley. Some environmental water protection.
I don’t like oil leaks. Yet you need to steam to check for them.
Over all I was made to feel good about leaving vette there. It went in around 8am and out that afternoon...
So far so good, I will bring my other cars there and will always recommend to others. In closing let me say that I took it to another auto shop in stockton they said that most of the leak was coming from the upper and lower oil pan which would of had a lot more involment. When I got under the car later, the leak was not at all cocnsistant with upper and lower oil pan leaking. So I passed on Stockton shop.
My wife and were in Ripon having a coffee on main and say the shop. So I went in, Ryan was there right away to listen to my problem. We set up the appointment and it got done.
Thanks Ripon Auto.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<rating>5< /rating><review>You have to arrive very early. We arrived an hour early, lucky we did as the queue grew very quickly. You have a 2 hour window to shoot, there is a target change every 20 or 30 mins. Staff was professional and efficient. T was our range master at the time, very friendly and knowledgeable person. Mask and social distancing rules are in effect and upheld. I had a fun and safe time with my wife.</review>< Pictures>

Very nice people! Tee, and the gentleman in the office, Thank you very much! You made my day. It's very busy, and hot, especially with the mask and headset. But your kindness and humorous made my first range practice a perfect experience. Really appreciate!<//text>

<Review>Staff are friendly,  and sarcastic so you'd better be ready to give and take some good natured ribbing.  ^_^ the range officer was kind. She also took time help me with pistol basics, and let me fire her side arm. This will become my regular home.</Review>< userid>

Brian and T are awesome staff! Ths range is very safe and the range masters are excellent. Fairly clean. No rifle FMJ is the only downside. The range furniture could be updated but its still solid and functional.< /review>

<text>Well run and remarkably few marginal people.  It has 3 ranges: a 50 foot indoor range, a 50 yard outdoor range and a 100 yard outdoor range.   Unfortunately,  the 100 yard range is sitdown at the bench only but that's a small disadvantage.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Our staff will provide signage and verbal updates if this situation with our point-of-sale system continues.\n\nThank you.\n\nUpdate: we are adding those flashing pucks to let people know when they're ready to go."}</Response><Text>Extremely upset by how they wasted people's time. I understand there is rules and what not. Though when you make someone wait in line OUTSIDE for 40 minutes just to tell them CASH ONLY once they are allowed inside... that becomes a huge problem because some of us actually live in the present times and only use cards.  At the very least be customer friendly and put the dang sign outside. Where we can see it or remind your range master to tell us when hes checking us in for the line outside.  This was first and last experience here.  Much rather driver 35 miles to another outdoor range that uses common sense.<//Text><Date>1590008056559<//Date><rate>1</rate><Pics>None</Pics>< GmapID>

The guy named Jeff there is very rude and he’s always yelling at people. We went today and he kicked us out for hitting the wood wall in front of you. And he didn’t even give us a refund back. And that place is very dirty and they are over priced. There was mosquitoes all over the place and spiders hanging down from the ceiling so don’t go there it’s a bad place with bad customer service< /Review>

Great place to exercise the 2A and Friendly people working there. The current issue is the answering machine leaving the caller confused. During the Pandemic, I check their websit . Google's info and it claims they are open until you actually visit to find out its closed<//text>

<text>It's one thing to be incompetent, but it's another to be rude. Why does the older man in the front feel the need to act condescending? There are people who are new to firearms, so try being a little patient with them. This isn't how you get more people to be interested in guns and sympathetic to the cause. And as for the younger guy, seriously, drop the attitude. Just because you work at a gunrange doesn't make you some badass. It's people like you that make me wonder why some people should even own firearms. I'll be taking my business elsewhere in the future.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

< review>
I visited this range a week ago and I brought a friend with zero shooting experience and his brand new rifle. We'll get back to that.

The facilities are certainly sufficient. You won't encounter any specific shine or a feeling of "deluxe" here, but it is after all a shooting range that is also quite busy. They have an indoor range for handgun shooting (no Magnum ammo can be used there with the only exception being .22 caliber) that has automated target retrieval systems in place. They also have an outdoor pistol & rifle range. The pistol area outdoors has 12, 25 and 50 yard target distances while the rifle range has benches and the distance is set at 100 yards. The outdoor area operates on 15 minute shooting intervals followed by brief cease fire periods so the shooters can go inspect and replace targets as needed.

In my experience the staff was great! They were respectful but strict about safety rules (thanks for that, I wouldn't really feel safe otherwise) and they were also very helpful and cooperative. As I mentioned in the beginning my friend was a new shooter and had a brand new rifle that needed to be broken in properly, but neither him nor I knew much about how exactly to perform the process. One of the range officers took the time to guide us through it and help us where needed. I honestly did not expect such great service!

One thing worth mentioning is that if you get scolded by a range officer it isn't because they get off on that. During our visit there were a couple of patrons who heard the "safety speech" but that was only after they acted in an unsafe manner that was specifically listed as unacceptable in the rules of the facility. If you heard the speech don't be sore about it - you probably did something to deserve it.

A couple of recommendations:

1. Wear your ear protection as soon as your leave your car. It is quite loud, even in the parking lot.

2. Take their safety test if you want to get a 40% discount off your lane fee.

UPDATE: As of 2017 you CAN'T shoot .223 or 5.56 FMJ ammo at this range. Soft Point or Lead ammo are okay. I believe it has something to do with causing excessive damage to their back wall. Best call in advance if you have high powered, high velocity FMJ ammo.

Shotguns okay with slugs only.

Bottom line - I'll definitely be back there. It is conveniently placed close to where I live and I get to shoot outdoors, which is a definitely plus in my book.</review>

The worst range I have ever been staff is rude place is over priced. Save your money use it for gas to drive to a better range. It's sad in the days of are 2nd amendment being in trouble it would be great if this range would higher better staff. I live in Hayward but will be driving to reeds or Metcalf.<//Text>

Great Shooting Range!
I've been going now for three months and its now my go to location. I've taken 5 people with me in the last two months and they've all enjoyed it. The staff is knowledgeable, friendly and professional. My favorite is Al. My 12yr old son, nephew and I have all received our Range Safety Cards. This makes sure we are in compliance with the Range Rules and also saves us money. While having fun, we all are enhancing our shooting skills, exercising our 2nd amendment rights and developing great memories! As a Veteran, on the 11th of each month, its FREE for me! I highly recommend joining.</Text>

Nice and friendly staff.Only $15 dollars if come with range safety card, and it good for all day. One thing people should care about is that, the range don't allow FMJ rounds. Only sp and hp under .50 caliber in rifle rounds can be shoot at that range.<//text>

Staff was very friendly, although the range master on the mic did have a sense of getting your attention over the loud speaker.

The basic layout is simple - indoor and outdoor range, the range master's office, a bathroom, and a parking lot. I have not been to the indoor range, but the outdoor range consists of handgun stalls and rifle stalls. You'll have to manually change your targets for the outdoor handgun stalls. The rifle stalls are set fairly far out (100 yards?).

It's fairly loud even in the parking lot, but you'll need ear protection at all times as you enter the property. Don't want tinnitus do ya?

There is a simple and free course safety test that'll get you discounted lane fees. Despite what other reviews have said, because of how pricing works, even without the test, the range fees are reasonably priced. Basically, you can shoot until you run out of ammo for a one-time fee. Coincidentally, you can buy more ammo at the range master's station.

Oh yeah, watch out for the spiders.<//review></record></dataset><record>

I made two errors on the test but Michael still allowed me to pass. He just pointed out the correct answers and explain efficiently. If you made a mistake regarding safety issue, they will approach you and correct you politely. I never felt uneasiness at all. I'm sure they can be mean if they felt that you have not been paying attention especially during ceasefires. Read the rules and guidelines before you come here. Be attentive and humble, I'm sure you'll have a good time just like I experienced here today. Michael is the man!</review>< Resp>

<Date>1525037786264<//Date><Rate>1<//Rate><Review>I would give zero stars if it was an option. Doesn't even deserve a 1 star. Worst range ever. Worst service ever. Called before hand just to make sure I could shoot my 5.56 AR pistol at this range and the range master on the phone said yes. I specifically stated "AR PISTOL chambered in 5.56", and he said "yes it was allowed" however, no steel core/casing/FMJ ammo allowed, so I asked if they had approved 5.56 ammo on site for sale. They said yes again. So after a 1hr drive down to the range, they tell me I apparently can't shoot my AR pistol even at the outdoor range because apparently "a pistol is inherently not as accurate as a rifle" and can't shoot it in the pistol range either because 5.56 is apparently too high of a caliber...are you serious? Get a grip. The 2 workers at the front desk were also borderline incompetent. One of them told me it's listed in the rules on their website that AR pistols aren't allowed at the range, but I specifically made sure to review the rules on their site very carefully and as mentioned above, even called in to ask and make sure before hand. Nothing on their site makes any mention at all about AR Pistols not being allowed. In fact, don't see a single mention of AR pistols at all. Purely incompetent staff and very rude and condescending when we were nothing but polite and courteous. One of the employees seemed slow and extremely confused as to what an AR Pistol was, and was perplexed at a pistol shooting 5.56. He had to ask the older employee who was the one who lied to our faces and told us we couldn't shoot there after we got there when he initially said we could when. I called in! Epic waste of our time. People like this should not be working at a range.< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>Staff is friendly and answers your questions. Available parking is light. I used the outdoor range, both short and long. They serve their purpose and that's about, it which is fine. They aren't clean or high end, it's just plywood marking you off from the shooter next to you. Because of their basic setup, the top of the wall doesn't close off with the ceiling/roof and lets things fall into your lane from above.

Here's the main problem; a hot casing from the lane next to me had fallen into my shirt and forced me to stop what I was doing to remove it and keep it from burning me. I was holding a loaded firearm which I had to knowingly keep pointed down range with my finger off the trigger all while scrambling to get this hot casing off of me. Luckily I was calm and aware of this, but this could have been easily someone else who could have caused a mishap and inured themselves or someone else. I hope that gets addressed.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>Very unhappy with the visit to this range. They're not too friendly to unfamiliar faces and new shooters. The big problem was how unfriendly and mean the range masters were. The range master that was watching over us was named Don D. and he was condescending and mean from the second after we paid. The cashiers that inspect our ammo were also very unfriendly and treated us like we didn't belong.

I went with two of my other friends that also wanted to shoot their rifles. As we stepped out on to the 100 yard mark Don instantly started judging us and treating us like we were idiots. I understand we're around firearms but you don't have to treat us like children and also like we're worthless and don't belong here. Over the short amount of time we spent at this range we were belittled and Don mocked our skill. I've been shooting for a very long time, almost my whole life and I have NEVER had such a terrible time at a range before. I refuse to come back to this range and have been telling everyone I know that shoots to stay away because of the terrible service of all the employees here. I suggest you do the same and go elsewhere.< /Text>< Date>

<text>This range has a small amount of shooting benches on the 100 yard line, so on busy days you can expect to be added to the wait list. The range looks slightly run down, but steady improvements are being made. This is a good place to shoot, but improvements can be made.<//text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x808f856c4e13579d:0x9de485dab01d6eab< /gmapID></record>

<text>Wonderful first experience at this range.  I was welcomed as soon as I got there and treated well, and didn't see any hint of the attitude/sarcasm reported in other reviews.

The indoor range is well ventilated and doesn't have the constant linger of cordite that other nearby ranges have.  Maybe I just caught it on a good day, but the odor of the nearby waste treatment plant was hardly there.  It wasn't until I got outside afterwards and really tried that I could detect it.

I was given the discounted fee after taking the test on-the-spot, despite my physical safety card taking another week to process.  Anyone scoffing at the $25 lane fee: just take the test.  I don't think the point is to charge anyone $25, but rather give everyone incentive to sit down and think about safety for a bit.

No time limits on the line, plenty of stations, and best of all for me: they are open late enough most days that I can get in range time after work.  Lane fees are reasonably priced for the area.  Add in being a cool 15 minute drive away and having indoor and outdoor (rare in the area), and this became my go-to range from the first visit.</text><Resp>None<//Resp><user_id>108880945341691069152</user_id>< pics>

Great range. Take the test and get the card and you will get 10 bucks off.

The range is well run, but still a public range so don't expect anything except a clean and function place to practice.</Text>

Good local range. Take the safety test. Been here 2x. Just follow range rules and you're good to enjoy your plinking. Will try the outdoor range next time.< /review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Clean, well lighted, well run, helpful staff.  Great place to shoot.  Some of the negative reviews seem unfair.  The range is next to a trash transfer station but unless the wind is out of whack there is no problem with the smell.  This place is much better than many of the terrible ranges I have been to over the years.< /Text>< pictures>

Clean and well supervised.  My only complaint is that they make you take a silly written safety test to get a "range safety card." If you don't take thier silly test, they you extra money to shoot!  Otherwise it is a good place to shoot.<//Review>

<Text>Wanted to rate 0 if I could! Front desk staff was very unfriendly. Very frustrated, drove 2 hrs there but was denied to enter just because I was not too sure what caliber my gun is? I actually answered correctly it’s 0.38 but she misled me into thinking that’s not correct answer and then I wasn’t sure the answer and she denied me enter. This is the second time (and the last time)I went there. The first time experience was totally differently, I didn’t encountered any issue.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Review>Okay, I'll skip the part where I tell you how qualified I am to shoot guns.
I'm a hard working American. And making me "learn" gun safety to shoot at your range for regular prices is honestly pretty shady business hiding behind the excuse of safety. If you could earn the card on the spot and not just on the weekends. I could understand it. But I work a lot and I don't always the time to "prove" I know how shoot on the weekend. Cmon guys, making me jump through hoops? My business will remain at other ranges.<//Review></record>

I've been going here for years. Since Chabot closed the range has gotten a bit more crowded. The hours of operation are generous and the range masters do a good job encouraging people to exercise the range safety rules.< /Review>

I have been shooting at the San Leandro Rifle & Pistol Range for more than four years. Not only is the range location close to where I live, their staff is well trained helpful professionals, has a safe shooting environment and is well managed.

Having used other shooting ranges in and around the Bay Area and in other states the San Leandro Rifle & Pistol Range has met all of my shooting needs and will more than meet the needs of other shooters.<//text>

2nd time i had to leave this place. First time was becuase, i was given the wrong info over the phone. Today was because no one checked my ammo and i didn't know that fmj was not allowed on this range, but thats not what upset me. What upset me was the way i was told to get off the range property becuase of it. This young kid (keanu reeve doppelganger) said " im kicking you off the range". Im like why? Becuase of your fmj, i didn't fuss or complain. So when i went back into the office to return the scope i rented, i asked this older gentleman who wore a army hat. Sir can i still shoot my handguns, which he replied yes, after you secure your ammo and rifle back in your vehicle. I was like great fine thats ok. But then that doppelganger said no i kicked him off the range for fmj. I said wait a second i just paid $45 for my son and i to shoot the handguns at least, hes like no. I said then i should be entitled a refund at least, since you guys wobt even let me shoot my handguns right? At that moment another rude older man glasses and white hair said the rules have been outside posted, using his finger to point. Both these two guys were rude and had no savy or tack, just stern and plane rude, if i didnt have my son with me and we were somewhere else only!!!!. To the manager of this place, this use to be a nice place to come to with family, now it just sucks becuse of these two guys. What comes around goes around as far as treating customers. God hates ugly and your two guys were rude and unsensitve.  Not to mention a couple of thieves for not refunding my $45 at least.<//text>

Pretty friendly people here, and feels safer and less beat up than Target Masters West in Milpitas. Definitely recommend getting a range safety card to get the $15 all-day entrance fee. They also have an active FB page where they do announcements + a Wednesday Ladies night where women shoot for free which is an amazing deal, shooting is such an expensive hobby to begin with.< /text>

Great range but they have horrible/rude staff (most of them). I feel sorry for the few good ones. NOT even worth-it to call them range masters. I come here atleast once a week. I see to it that i follow each rules and regulation when i go and shoot  at different ranges to alway be on the safe side and stay away from trouble. I get worried when a staff yell and humiliate new shooters that might end up in a bad situation (outdoor range).  Range masters should always be keeping their eye on the range to prevent accidents and not using the computer/internet to look for gun parts. Yelling, unnecessary cursing, racist, bad mouthing comment will not help at all new shooters to follow and remember instructions. Instead,  your staff are driving away shooters new and old. I will try to stay away from this range until i see some changes.<//review>

<review>1. Need to be specific on their hours, specifically on what lanes are open. went there this morning to try and shoot at their rifle lanes. Unfortunately, they say it was close and will not open at 12pm but they say they are open at 9am...
2. If you have taken their safety test (beats me why) and haven't pick up your card for a period of time. Be prepared to pay and take it again...< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Family-oriented handgun & rifle range, founded by the Optimists Club. Has a marksmanship program for kids that follows NRA guidelines. Several members of the marksmanship program have gone on to national prominence.<//Review>

Local and not hard to get to, its a 5 minute drive from the 880 nestled at the west end of Davis St and if youre looking to get a few hours in after work, take a date, and/or just want to let off a few rounds its an ideal spot.Ill admit, there's some things that that inhibit me from giving it a 5 star but let me start out with the positive. They offer a indoor area, its well ventilated, well lit, and targets are a attached to motor operated draw string for easy adjustment of feet/yardage without interruption. The outside range however and understandably has 20 minute interruptions with a 10-15 minute (check, change, or remove target) period. The outside range offers up to 100 yard target practice with bench like seating. They also offer carpeted rest blocks for easy resting of your firearm (cleaning and target practice). The staff is friendly, always smiling, mainly older gents, and never had an issue but I cant see how you can have an issue if youre not familiar with firearm and/or range safety. Make no mistake, they will call you out, they got a PA system so everyone will hear it, and make it known if youre being unsafe in anyway. Most are knowledgeable in whatever your questions may be although most will leave you be if you know what youre doing.

Id like to add theres a nice little picnic area as well as a smoking area just a few feet from the firing line. Kind of a bonus if youre a smoker (i quit a few back) and I always bring a snack so its a plus for me in that regards.

They also have clean restrooms in case you need to take a break.

Now for the negative...First and foremost, you have to realize its location and location is the positive and negative in both situations, its a double edged sword.Its wedged right between the water treatment plant and the Davis street dumps so if youre sensitive to smell you'll notice it even before you pull into the parkinglot. Theres a minor pest problem (nats, flys, etc...)  and Im not gonna lie, its awful on a hot day, mix that with the smell of low tide from the bay and its almost unbearable, almost...

And lastly, my last gripe about the place is on the long range side (all the way over to the right) they only have (1) 50 yard target that pops down and if youre lucky enough to snag that seat your golden.

I recommend it to folks who live in the eastbay especially after chabots unfortunate announcement of their closure.

I want to clear the prices up and no I dont work and/or own the place. Its a 15 dollar flat fee with membership card with is free and all you have to do is take a firearm safety test which is also free and give you the basics on how they and most ranges operate. I read through the comments and most are incorrect not to mention you can tell a little butthurt about paying the 25 dollar no-membership fee so just do yourself a favor and get the membership if you plan on visiting more than once, you'll save money just on your second visit.

Needless to say, I wrote a lot here but its a honest review. I scrolled through most the reviews and its either bad or good but Ill be the first to tell you  Im quite thankful these guise (and girls) are still open to the public as most ranges are closed and/or closing due to environment issues with lead and what not. Just be humble we still have a place to go thats no more than 20 minutes in every direction to the locals here in the eastbay and again, thank you for providing a place we can all enjoy.

On a side note, Drakes brewery is located 5 minutes away, get place to grab a decent beer and a bite to eat after a good target practice!

Cheers,

~ Chris<//text>

This place sucks! There seems to be no good shooting ranges in the bay area for us shotgun users. They wont allow birdshot at all even though it is the most affordable shotgun ammo.</Review>

Great place for kids. There's a small bridge that is great for pictures. Trees offer a lot of shade. Be weary of random people who like to smoke weed. Hopefully the city eventually gets some security to patrol.<//Text>

<text>Park is great. Lots of stuff for kids of all ages. Lots of play structures, a tall slide and swings. Its behind the pool. Only downfall is the homeless hanging around,  but they kept to themselves. There is a restroom but I didn't check it out because the homeless seem to use it.p<//text>< Pictures>

My daughter loves this place. Although lately there hasnt been much as far as maintenence. Most likely due to covid. Spiderwebs on the play structures mostly not in walking/playing areas but under and around poles<//text>

<Review>Watched the Fireworks. Great band and good turn out.  Was disappointed by lack of benches and tables. Also restrooms by play structure were filthy with no soap or paper towels. Anticipation of a crowd should also require preparedness. Overall we had a great time and enjoyed the fireworks and watching kids play.</Review><user_id>113962210679069963520< /user_id></record>

<Review>Awesome park to take kids of all ages to. Wonderful, only draw back is the playground equipment isn't covered, but it is shaded by lots of trees. Beautiful place to take family pictures, or to meet up for a day of fun.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

This is a nice park has a field that the kids used to practice ball on and there's the library public library right down there there's a public pool connected to this so it's a great place for bringing the kiddos like always just watch the people and surroundings there you never know what's truly in the park so always best to keep an eye on on your little one but it's a good place</text>

Very nice public park. It's small; but has picnic tables and BBQ grills; and plenty of shade trees.
There are Restrooms, and a playground for the children.< /Text>

Lots of picnic tables and play structures. Birds flitting through the trees. Small bridge crossing a small creek. Compact but charming.< /review>
</record></dataset><record>
< Review>
Not really what I expected.  Little cliffs for kids to fall off on the walking paths. Not crazy steep but someone could easily get hurt if they stepped wrong and tumbled down.  Super cool creaky old bridge that leads to a path, that leads right up to a road.  Play ground equipment says it's for smaller kids but all the slides are crazy high off the ground at the end. My kids were flying off right on to their bottoms pretty hard.  The ground is uneven,  the bathrooms were pretty bad,  cigarettes on the ground in the bathroom. No soap but they did have toilet paper. There were at least 6 homeless people hanging out but they didn't bother us and seemed friendly enough.  My kids had fun but I don't think we will be returning.< /Review>

Regarding ad/article, "Potential Signs of Human Trafficking" (posted on SF Weekly and on Dolan Law Firm website), Dolan Law Firm is not the place to go for these cases.     Dolan Law Firm response: "we will not be able to represent you in this matter as the issue you are inquiring about falls outside of our practice area." but their ads clearly imply they're knowledgeable about cases of trafficking in "escort services, truck stops, and hotels".      Please don't post misleading ads as you don't handle these cases.<//text>

<Text>I had the pleasure of working with Dolan Law Firm (Mari was so great to work with --I would recommend her to friends in a heartbeat). They responded to our inquiry right away and were incredibly helpful in guiding us through the process. Not only did their legal advice help us get the outcome we wanted, but their dedication to their clients is the best I've seen across any firm.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<review>My entire experience with the Dolan Law Firm was great. Recommended to me by a friend, I contacted them after I suffered a dog bite to my face. I initially spoke to Chris to give him my story and since I live in Los Angeles, he thought it would be best to have one of his team members work on my case. Aimee Kirby and her team are the lawyers that were assigned to help me.

I met with Aimee soon after for my consultation. She was very personable and professional - answering any and all questions I had while explaining to me what to expect over the next few months. Going forward, she and her team kept me updated and quickly got back to me with answers to anything else that would come up along the way.

They were able to negotiate a much better settlement than I could have thought of. I am grateful for their time and persistence on my case. I felt that they were representing me as if I was someone they knew and cared about for a long time.

I hope that I will not need their services again in the future, but if something should happen to me, they would be the first firm that I would go to.

Thank you again!</review>< pics>

The legal professionals practicing here are the best in the business! As the victim, it was a difficult process to go through, however, with the support of my team - Vanessa and Emile - it was well worth it. My case was resolved effectively and efficiently. I HIGHLY recommend this firm.< /review>

Upon arriving at Dolan Law Firm I was greeted with a smile from the woman at the reception desk. Everyone I met was warm and approachable. After a couple of minutes I was greeted by Isabelle Tan, the attorney handling my consultation. She took her time to clearly explain how the whole process will work and I never felt rushed. She made certain that I understood each step before she moved on. After an informative and relaxed consultation I decided to pursue my case with Dolan. All communications were answered in a very timely manner. Most emails were even answered within minutes. Aimee Kirby, the managing attorney, and Isabelle were great and kept me up to date on the progress of the case from start to finish.

I've had a case handled by a different law firm in the past and I felt rushed and even irritation at times from the attorney when I didn't understand something and needed to ask for clarification. That was not a pleasant experience. I wish I knew of Dolan then. Dolan made dealing with legal matters a very comfortable experience for me.  I highly recommend them and will definitely seek their experience again if the need arises.</Text>

<username>Allan Nguyen</username><date>1510704768689</date><Rate>5</Rate><Review>Emile and the Oakland team at Dolan Law Firm were exactly the lawyers we needed when I was in my biking accident a little over a year ago.

We had interviewed multiple lawyers prior to assigning one to the case and what stood out the most to my wife and I were these three main qualities.

1. Thorough and Responsive - Set correct expectations
2. Experience matters - They’re very familiar with the process
3. Set us at ease - Friendly and easy to speak to

Being our first time having lawyers, we weren’t too sure how the process would look like and what would go on during the whole process. We asked lots of questions and Emile and his team we’re very patient and walked us through the entire process from beginning to end and even went through some scenarios that weren’t on our minds. Another reason we chose Dolan and their team was how well they set expectations for us. At the end of our first real meeting with the team at Dolan, I knew we could rest easy and they delivered.

I’m really happy with our experience with Dolan Law Firm and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a lawyer!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x8085809c1fd9fe9f:0x20c287ead7dbf05b< /gmapID></record>

< Review>
The greatest misconception and one I take offense to is hearing a personal injury attorney being called an "ambulance chaser". I suffered a horrible, life changing accident due to the negligence of another and if it weren't for Chris Dolan and the Dolan Law Firm, I'm not certain where I might be now. Chris treated me and my case, from the onset, like something that had happened to him personally and like a matter of life or death. He walked, talked, lived and breathed my case for nearly 4 years. His brilliance and extensive knowledge in both law as well as the medical field was a gross advantage to him winning a nearly 3 month jury trial against the City of San Francisco for me. Through it all, his focus remained clear and obvious. It was all me and what what would deliver the greatest outcome  for my situation. I've often heard others complain that lawyers get such a large % of an award but as far as I'm concerned, every penny & more is earned. Prior to this experience, I had no idea how much it takes to win a case or the tremendous expense and time which goes into it. All of which is absorbed on the front end by the attorney, with no guarantee of a positive outcome. Chris believes in justice and righting the wrongs. He was my voice when no one seemed to hear my words. He fearlessly and furiously stood up to an entity that could have easily mowed me over with trickery and outright lies. Chris had enough patience for the both of us when I would loose mine to keep going. I have never met another human being better at what he does than Chris Dolan is at protecting and fighting for his clients. He is one of the most brilliant attorneys of his time with a proven track record of his successful outcomes. He pours 100% into every case and selectively takes on many others shy away from. Never afraid of a challenge and always ready to take on even the largest corporate "bully", Chris Dolan and the Dolan Law Firm is better than the best! I would want nobody else in my corner if I ever find myself in a situation again needing a personal injury attorney.  Thank you Chris from the bottom of my heart!!! You helped me to get back so much of what that accident took from me. Now, 18 years later, my gratitude and appreciation is as strong as it was the very lucky day I walked through the doors of the Dolan Law Firm for the very first time!! If you're looking for the best, go no further. You've found the firm around!!<//Review>

<Text>My experience with the Dolan Law Firm was smooth and painless from start to finish. I was treated with courtesy, honesty and professionalism throughout the entire process. My team fought for a settlement that was fair, equitable and the best part timely! My team consisted of Chris Dolan and Guillermo Bustillo -- all of whom were professional and knowledgeable and wonderful to deal with. I know I could not have made it without them. I would recommend the Dolan Law Firm to anyone requiring professional legal advice or assistance. Thank You!< /Text><Name>Kate Harrison<//Name>< resp>

My review is solely on the event space. As a non-profit board member, it's tough to find available space and for a budget to meet on a monthly basis. Luckily, Dolan Law Firm offers event spaces for free for non-profits. It's walking distance from Bart, impeccably decorated and the conference room on the second floor is spacious, seating a range from 8-10 people. They also had a space in the middle of the room with a very long conference table that looked like it could seat up to 20-30 people with ample standing room and a full kitchen. I would definitely use this space to hold future events, whether it's for professional development or a social mixer.</text>

I run a nonprofit organization in the Bay Area, and we were looking for a place where our board of directors could meet.  The Dolan Law Firm was extremely gracious and allowed us to hold a meeting in one of their stylish conference rooms.  The entire floor has been dedicated to social justice, which is apparent by the decorative memorabilia from public interest causes.  All of our directors were very impressed by the decor and awards lining the brick walls.</text><resp>None<//resp></record>

<date>1450154825618< /date><text>The Dolan Law Firm was extremely generous to donate their space to the San Francisco Bay Area Women's Environmental Network for a panel we hosted on the California drought. As a volunteer-based nonprofit, we have a limited budget and no office space of our own, so we were extremely grateful for this opportunity. The event was one of the best we have ever hosted - we filled the room and received rave reviews from event attendees. Their friendly, coordinated staff, beautiful space, and professional atmosphere made this event especially enjoyable for everyone.

It's great to see a local business giving back like this - it makes it so much easier for us to carry out our mission of enhancing stewardship of the environment and fostering a strong community of women in the environmental sector. We'd host another event here in a heartbeat.<//text><Gmap_id>0x8085809c1fd9fe9f:0x20c287ead7dbf05b<//Gmap_id>< Pics>

<gmapID>0x8085809c1fd9fe9f:0x20c287ead7dbf05b</gmapID><text>Last year, I got attacked by a dog. The dog bit off the top of my ear and chunk out the top of my arm. I was referred to Dolan Law Firm and worked with Megan Irish and Quentin Cutlip. My experience with Dolan Law was excellent. Not only were they sympathetic to what happened to me, I knew they really cared about making sure that I was going to be compensated correctly. Megan was really exceptional with communicating and making sure that I understood everything that was going on during my year long case. They were able to negotiate a settlement that was more than I could have imagined. I am truly grateful and can not express enough gratitude for their hard work. I hope that I don't have any more situations where I need a lawyer.. but if I did, I would call Dolan Law first.< /text>< Rating>

You'll perhaps remember Dolan Law from the reflective leg bands they generously provide on bike to work day. I was here a for a Sunday Streets meeting, with ample bike parking upstairs. The offices are attractively decorated with exposed brick and hardwood. These folks are very knowledgeable about bike accidents and law of tort. If I ever suffer from a close encounter of the beer truck kind, I'll seek help here.<//review>

<text>If you're reading this, you're probably looking for a lawyer. I'm writing this review to tell you to look no further. The Dolan Law Firm lawyers and staff will fight for you. They are honest from the beginning and actually care about justice and holding responsible parties accountable. Finding lawyers is easy. Finding lawyers who have experience, a relentless drive to succeed, a proven track record, and listen to you is not as easy, but you've found them at the Dolan Law Firm.<//text><Rate>5< /Rate><date>1491365910621</date>< pics>

Dolan Law Firm has generously offered space in their office for Sunday Streets to host meetings and volunteer trainings. Sunday Streets is a program that promotes healthy activity and sustainability by opening miles of city streets for people to get out and get active in San Francisco Neighborhoods. We are run by the small non-profit Livable City.  We have a small office space and limited budget to spend on space rentals. Dolan Law has generously hosted us on several occasions when we needed space larger than we have available.

The staff has always been friendly, professional, and as accommodating as possible. It's great to see a law firm supporting local community organizations and investing in the neighborhood. Thanks for all you do!<//Text>

<Review>DON'T GO ANYWHERE ELSE! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ATTORNEY AND HIS FIRM
5.0 stars

Chris Dolan of the Dolan Law Firm is the most competent and successful attorney, bar none, that has ever represented me, and the best attorney to whom I have ever referred business. I was in an automobile accident and I can't say enough as to how I was treated by Chris and his team, and the ultimate results they provided to me for my case far exceeded my expectations. I have since referred many, many people to Mr. Dolan & his law firm and continue to be impressed with their results, their demeanor, and their desire to represent their clients in the best possible manner. I highly recommend Chris Dolan and the Dolan Law Firm for representation in your legal matters, and their is no other lawyer with Mr. Dolan's drive , compassion, intellect, humility and work ethic.< /Review>< pictures>

I was involved in car vs. bicycle accident and badly injured. Friend of mine recommended Marjorie Heinrich from Dolan Law Firm for representation.  Marjorie handled all the aspects regarding my accident including hospitals/doctors/insurance companies/experts. I was well informed about the process and issues that were involved in the case. Marjorie provided very strong representation with her extensive experience. At the end of the day case was resolved to my satisfaction. I could have not asked for better attorney that cared and worked very hard on the case.
I highly recommend Marjorie for representation of personal injury cases.<//Text>

<Review>I inquired about some employment issues my friend was having at her workplace and spoke with Mari Bandoma.

<Text>Numerous people referred me to Chris Dolan when I needed to speak to an attorney regarding a potential wrongful death action. During my initial meeting, Chris explained the law and my options clearly. After the meeting, I felt that Chris and his associates were going to competently handle my case. The Dolan Law Firm conducted research about my potential case quickly and informed me of my options. In the end, we decided not to file a law suit but the Dolan Law Firm still helped me deal with the insurance companies.
I would highly recommend this office to others. Chris, Guillermo, and Jeremy were easy to deal with and answered my questions promptly. Even though, I did not become a client, the office still helped me deal with all the paperwork which I was in no condition to deal with after having suffered a tragic loss. I would not hesitate to use this firm in the future.</Text>< user_name>

As is in the court room, judge every character based upon the evidence presented. Listen to the verbal testimony and analyze the actions that transpire.

Well, thankfully, I didn't have to go as far as the courtroom. Vanessa Deniston with her expertise and sound input helped reinforce tactics for me to conclude my workplace dilemma without needing to proceed with a lawsuit. During all that, she was prompt to accept my followup calls in my time of need and displayed genuine, verbal sympathy to my unfortunate, now fortunate, situation.

What is truly admirable is Vanessa's candor. Not in the form of being dry and blunt, but being concerned and realistic for your well-being.

If you have become the unlucky candidate of a legitimate workplace issue worthy of the law and are uninformed how to proceed, I wholeheartedly recommend Vanessa to any employee in distress.

Vanessa, if you're reading this, THANK YOU for the help!< /text>

We sought legal advice from Chris Dolan at the Dolan Law Firm when my family and I were in a motor vehicle accident. The team provided exceptional service. They were prompt with their responses and provided detailed guidance as to what the process would be for our situation. I would highly recommend anyone to contact Chris Dolan at the Dolan Law Firm if you've ever been in a motor vehicle accident and require representation.

The Dolan Firm handled a wrongful death lawsuit for my family last year, and I cannot begin to tell you how well my case was handled.  Whenever I called there was never a problem getting in touch with my attorney Quinton Cutlip.  If he wasn't in the office I left a message, and he contacted me right away; that means a lot at a troubling time.  Also, his assistant Daniela Martinez was always available for questions in Quinton's absence. I strongly recommend this firm.</Review>

After Dolan accepted my case, working with Dolan Law Firm was a pleasure and I sat back while Ethan and Jeremy went to work on my case and consistently provided updates when needed.

I agree w/drphldds and the others that gave a one (1) start!  My case was solid and they blew my case and I see a lot of 5 star ratings from folks who never had a case, just talk to people!  What a joke to make themselves look better when they really do not care about anything but $$$.  They will rotated your case w/"temp's" and leave you dry!  Chris Dolan only cares about himself!!!</Review>

I highly recommend the Dolan Law Firm and I am extremely thankful to Vanessa Deniston.
Working with Vanessa individually proved her to be strong-willed, confident, and fought passionately while representing me. I had a great rapport with her immediately and knew she was secure, capable, and committed to my case as well as myself.
Vanessa was very good about her direct communication and keeping me informed about what to expect in the next steps of my case.
Chris Dolan, Vanessa Deniston, Emil Davis and Vanessa's assistant Evette Padilla work extremely well together and made me feel very confident that they were going to accomplish what needed to be done. As a team, they aggressively represented me and fought to protect my interests. We had a very positive outcome and I am truly thankful.< /review>

<Text>The worst law firm out there! Avoid at all costs! They never replied to my emails or calls and never got back to me. They left me hanging for an entire month with no communication and decided to just bail on my case and then when I called today asking what in the world is going on they tried to lie their way to innocence and then finally admitted to bailing on me.

What a bunch of crooks! 0/5 stars.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I came to the Dolan Law Firm multiple times seeking advice, once for an injury with my daughter and another for my employment and leave of absence issues. I was assisted by Attorney Mari Bandoma Callado, she was very quick in responding back to me and you can tell that she was very knowledgeable and passionate about what she does.  Both times Mari was helpful and took the time to make sure that I fully understood the regulations and my rights under FMLA.  I am extremely happy with the service and advice that I received and would highly recommend this firm to anyone.<//review>

If your group is a non-profit/local organization, consider hosting your organization's next event at no charge at Dolan Law Firm.  A special thank you to Dolan Law Firm for generously opening its San Francisco office to host a recent event for the Filipino Bar Association of Northern California (FBANC).  The size of the conference room and interior décor with community themed artwork was the ideal space to feature a panel of distinguished attorneys who spoke about topics of importance to the Filipino-American legal community.  The team at Dolan, through the leadership of Dolan attorney and FBANC Executive Board Member Mari Bandoma Callado, was very professional and accommodating.  They went the extra mile to help us set up the check-in station, speaker podium, food/refreshments, tables, and chairs for the panel and attendees.  We appreciate Dolan’s continued support of FBANC and its never-ending commitment to our community.</Text>

<Review>I went to seek advice regarding my (previous) contract position and possible breach of contract by my employer.  I was assisted by Atty. Mari Bandoma Callado, she discussed my rights thoroughly and I felt very confident after our meeting and was able to set things straight with my employer/agency. I again had to contact her a year later regarding other issues I had with my current job on my upcoming Maternity Leave.  I was stressed out because I was getting misleading info from my HR and after meeting with Mari and she helped me understand the current state law/ FMLA policy and I had a better and much clearer understanding that I was given the wrong information from work and I was able to use that to make sure I was able to take the correct amount of leave that I am entitled of.  There is nothing worse than a stressed out pregnant lady, and Mari definitely put me at ease and made sure that I should and will get the proper time off I needed to spend time and take care of my children. She is very knowledgable and passionate about her work and I can see that her passion to help people is genuine.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x8085809c1fd9fe9f:0x20c287ead7dbf05b<//Gmap_id><UserId.>108616882349166060417< /UserId.><rating>5< /rating><name>Maya Bueno</name><Date>1501135104731< /Date><response>None< /response>< Pics>

<Review>Chris Dolan and his team took on a very big case on my behalf against CalTrans. They believed passionately in the rightness of the case and did everything humanly possible to win. It was a staggering amount of work. We lost on a technicality due to the jurors not being allowed to ask a particular question based on motions made by CalTrans that the entire success of our case came down to. After the trial,  several jurors told us that had they been able to ask that question and learned the truth they would have filed in our favor. Chris argued the case passionately and convincingly and his staff and colleagues were indefatigable in their support. I have nothing but praise for the Dolan firm.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x8085809c1fd9fe9f:0x20c287ead7dbf05b<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Mr. Dolan drove all the way from SF to fresno Cal. to handle this case. He was so professional, helpful and kind to my step daughter. Mr. Dolan's office handled the case and produced for us a great outcome where everyone involved came out a winner.  I can never thank Chris Dolan enough for the help and comfort that he gave to my family at a time when we really needed it. Great man with a great business.

I highly recommend the Dolan Law firm. Hands down, there is not a better personal injury attorney around. Chris Dolan is an expert in his field. He was truly amazing, honest, compassionate, professional, down to earth and very responsive. My accident involved being hit by a Yellow Cab while walking in a cross walk in San Francisco. Soon after my accident Chris and his assistant, Guillermo Bustillo came to our home to make sure I was doing ok. They spent more than 2 hours at my home taking down all necessary information and quickly agreed to represent me. Chris Dolan was extremely courteous, sympathetic and empathetic, and he was truly concerned for my well-being. The Dolan Law firm was professional and knowledgeable during the entire case process. He made sure all of my physical therapy costs and medical bills were covered, and I was never once harassed by the Defendants. The process was smooth and seamless. They took care of everything. The legal process was performed with perfection, care and expertise.  Deadlines were always met and I never worried how my case was being handled. My case took nearly two years, and as we were approaching the end and close to a settlement, a curve ball was thrown by Yellow Cab – they filed for bankruptcy. Chris immediately called to reassure me that all of my out-of-pocket expenses would be handled and I did not need to worry. This would not be the end of my case. Given the drastic change of course in the settlement proceedings, he quickly developed a new plan of action which resulted in a fair compensation for me. The insurance company wanted to recoup all of their expenses. But, Chris Dolan and Guillermo Bustillo negotiated with the insurance company. They were able to successfully reduce the amount sought down to almost nothing! He further went above and beyond and personally called me to inform me he was reducing his firm fees.  Since no one could have expected Yellow Cab to file bankruptcy, Chris said he wanted to make sure I received as much compensation as possible. This case was not about “making money” but instead about helping me. I highly recommend Chris Dolan to represent your legal matters. Chris Dolan’s drive, intellect and compassion set him apart from any other attorney I know. He truly cares about his clients and their best interests.</Text>

<Text>The intake case manager kept making incorrect references to the info I had provided. I had to repeat several times that I was hit by a car and that I was riding a 250cc scooter - unpleasant phone etiquette, felt as if he's falling asleep on there other end.< /Text>< user>

Everything is simply delicious. we tried the malai kofta and mutton rogan josh and mango lassi. malai kofta was exquisite, they took the pain of frying the kofta properly. Rogan josh was great as well, mutton was tender and gravy was spicy.
We washed it all down with a mango lassi.
We'll definitely visit again.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPteQHOcwx_j-De3uiGn2nKyoLv9dAPeatmuB4f=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Resp>

Very Nice ambience, haven't seen many Indian spots look this nice. We were greeted by owner Darshan Singh, he is very nice host. The place was not very busy around 9:30pm maybe because it was near closing time. The food is is outstanding. everything we ordered was spot on. Really good mango Lassi ( kids Loved it). Saag paneer tasted like homemade, plain parathas were good also. : ) I would recommend this restaurant to all my friends and family.< /text>

Very rude host. We were a party of 4+1 toddler. She wouldn't give us a table inside even if we offered to wait. There was a table almost done, and we even asked if we could just wait for that table. She wanted us to sit right by the door and put our toddler's high chair in the way. She wouldn't be flexible in any way, and gave us a rude and unfriendly attitude. Basically told us to take a hike if we didn't want the table she wanted to give us. This host ruined it enough for us that we refuse to eat here. Absolutely horrendous service.

We walked across the street to Gourmet India and are having a much better experience so far.< /Review>

<response>None< /response><review>Was received pretty warmly and seating provided pretty quickly. However,

1. Had to wait for 15 mins before someone came and took our order.
2. Food was delayed by 40 mins.
3. Food was provided without any cutlery. When asked was rudely put into my plate.

4. Food was pretty average considering the ambience and similar ratings I had seen for other Indian restaurants.</review>< Date>

Fine ambience - In-efficient/super-novice hosts - awful Cocktails - OK-ish appetizers - Not at all impressive food (goat meat raw inside) - not going to recommend anyone to have your dinner here.
On a trip to San Diego from the bay area, me and my friends thought of hitting an Indian restaurant in the evening. We found that this restaurant had relatively higher rating the other ones in the area. So we decided to try Phulkari. The setup inside the restaurant looks nice. The host seemed novice from the beginning. Once my friends joined us after 15 minutes, we started ordering our food.
It is a busy weekend and we completely understand that it could be late to serve food and drinks. We started with cocktails. Each of them tasted pretty bad. Almost tasted like someone is trying out their hands for the first time. Even after getting one of the drinks fixed it tasted the same.
Later came the appetizers. It wasn't so great but tasted OK.
In the mean time the we are still waiting for the host to bring plates and silverware for one of our friends. Even after letting them know multiple times the food comes before and we had to keep on waiting for the plates.
The main food arrives in sometime. The food isn't served to appropriate person. It's just kept randomly on the table. We had to fix them on our own. Food Portions are less to be honest. We had ordered for a chicken, goat and a vegetable item. The rogan josh (goat) tasted like a regular goat curry with very strong taste of raw masala which is unusual in Indian food. Felt like not cooked properly. The meat was hard and the bigger chunks was raw/not-cooked inside. The chicken item tasted OK. The veg item was not impressive as well.

Over all with this disappointing experience here, I am never going to come back here any more neither will I recommend any body to try this one out.<//Text>

<Text>Till date this is the best restaurant which I have visited in the states. The food was mind blowing, we asked them to make it spicy and it was actual Indian spicy and not indo-american. I ordered Allo Parantha for my 16 months order and our server was kind enough to ask specifically about stuffing and spices to add. Must go restaurant. If ever get a chance, i will revisit it.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

Good food but extremely small portions, very slow service when pretty much the entire restaurant was empty and to compensate for all this pretty pricey.</review>

Not enough servers went 30 min with no one taking an appetIzer order, heard others complaining about slow service or unable to pay their bill and leave. After half an hour we left rather than waste an evening - downtown there are many many alternatives.< /Text>

<Text>Highly rated and for good reason. Super fresh ingredients (mozzarella made in house) and the dough/crust is superb (good crumb, right amount of chewy). They have a simple menu + suggestions for tasty combinations. Ambiance of the spot is chill and it’s clean!

Only complaint is slightly burnt crust on one of our pizzas. Prices are a bit high - my large two topping (lamb + mushrooms) was ~$35 - but I’d give them a shot. Service is friendly.</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-IyK7hWRm2d_AXbsBGBm0XGlWNAdHQirGWBVe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8AhaBSJ1k4g8AUR9TnDHBiAA_v-kk-LUejLrc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnAq9DIsSwXNx-ajqfPhqzPcQ7L-Dq3Czsfz6G=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeA1P6e_y9put-P8Y18In39RSAZgL9KScd97Wz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Response>

Great pizza. Maybe one of the best in the area. This guys makes his own cheese and it shows. Always reliable and always delicious.

Plus, in these times they've implemented exemplary distancing and safeguarding protocols as seen posed here. Please do support them.

<Review>This casual family-owned place serves exquisite wood-fired thin-crust pizzas. They fire-roast their own sauce which makes for a distinctive color and sweet taste. They also make their own mozzarella in-house.  The toppings and combinations are all incredible.  The kids will love the selection of unique frozen sorbet treats. And cyclists (like me) will love the collection of vintage bicycling decor.</Review>< name>

<review>Zero stars if possible!!!!!! This is by far one of the worst pizzas I have had in my life. How does this get 4.5 stars?? The sauce is just dribbled on top of the cheese and is some kind of strange watery brown stuff. We threw out almost the entire thing!!!!

Oh and if was burnt on the bottom and the entire crust as well< /review>< pics>

Six stars! Some of the best thin crust pizza on the peninsula! The menu is short and focused on their excellent thin crust pizza with an extensive array of high quality toppings / combos. They also make calzones but, honestly, you'd be missing out if you haven't had their pizza several times already. They have a few beers on tap and a selection of good drinks in the cooler, too. The owner Phil is there every day, working hard to make sure the quality is consistently high and the customers are happy.<//text>

< Review>
I liked the vibe when I walked in... The dough is fresh and they make their own cheese.
The sauce is completely different... definitely not traditional. My kids hated it and I asked for a pizza for 2 people (1 medium pizza) with 2 toppings and 1 salad and got charges $45. My daughter and I had 1 slice and threw the rest away.</Review>

<Text>best pizza in Belmont. sometimes has really long wait, but it's definitely worth the wait and the price.

They don't use thick crusts/bread, so you can actually taste the ingredients. The cheese they use is "homemade" and it does taste better than other places.</Text><name>Gunwoo Kim</name><Response>None</Response></record></dataset><record>

My 5 y/o expressed it as "not too good, not too bad". For an average tasting pizza, I'd also settle on 3/5 starts. But for a pizza that also costs $30, the expectation is higher.<//review>

<Review>Velo uses all fresh and home-made ingredients and it definitely shows - love this pizza! And the owner seems like a really nice guy... I ordered online and when I came in to pick up my pizza he asked if it was my first time and when I said yes he gave a quick rundown of how he makes the pizza and the ingredients he uses. Seems like he really cares about making a quality product that satisfies customers<//Review>< pics>

Economical for solo meals. But what I really loved is their mozzarella is fresh!! You can just know when it is fresh. Even the sauces they make are pretty amazing
Tried a couple of pizzas, even though I loved them, they weren't packed with flavour. Would be back here soon nevertheless<//review>< Pictures>

Was warmly invited in by the owner. My son and I were on our bike and was allowed to park it inside. Ordered a specialty pizza with roasted lamb made in house. I am typically more a fan of hand tossed crust, but this New York style thin crust was excellent along with the soft crumbled cheese put on top after it was baked.

One round of Do De Rubber Duck and a couple Twinkle Twinkle Little Star along with a juice box, and pie was ready. My son and I devoured it.

Never been before, but I look forward to going again!< /text>

Nice people, good service. I didn't like the pizza, but maybe it's just not my jam. Really thick cheese, and had sweetish sauce dribbled on top (just plain cheese) crust was a little floppy. It wasn't terrible pizza, but it just wasn't anything I'd go back for.</Text>

<text>Everything about this place is excellent. The pizza sauce doesn’t give my husband heartburn, fresh mozzarella and a variety of tasty toppings. We’re slowly working our way through the pizza flavors; if you customize your pizza order- you can always work with the gentleman who’s actually cooking the pizza to your preference. And if there’s anything you don’t care for- speak to the person working the counter; they’re very receptive. If you’re a fan of thick, squishy crust that’s found in most pizza places here- you won’t enjoy this pizza. It’s thin and slightly crunchy. Also, the ice cream at the front counter is a little pricey, but a great after pizza treat.</text><response>None<//response><Name>Alice Larios</Name><pictures>None</pictures>< userid>

<Date>1472732744036</Date><rate>5<//rate><review>I had this pizza for the first time last night and I must say I'm impressed. The pizza has a great original taste with New York style inspiration. The crust is light and crispy, the sauce is tangy, and the cheese is mozzarella. Cooked in a brick oven for perfect consistency.

The restaraunt is family run with kind courteous people and speedy service.  The restaurant itself is slick and clean with upstairs and downstairs seating. The only criticism I have is the sign out front is a little plain and a product this memorable needs a more memorable logo.

I'm a pizza fanatic and I try every pizzeria I can find. This place is in my top 10 for the SF Bay Area. Give this place a shot, the pizza is excellent.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I thought while pricey you're getting a real artisan experience. Everything feels really fresh and focused on being great. For cheap late night pizzas I wouldn't recommend but if you like Naples style pizza with really fresh sauce and clean tasting mozzarella this is an amazing experience.< /text>

4 stars because it's fine for California pizza.  But I must say...if you're familiar with real NY-style pizza, and expecting anything close to that based on the other reviews...you're gonna have a bad time.

1)  They don't sell slices, they only sell personal pizzas.  You can't even find personal pizzas in New York...wanna know why?   A personal pizza is about 40% crust.  It just ruins the ratio.  Personal pizzas are for children who don't know any better.
2)  The crust is way too thin and crunchy.  New York style pizza crust is thin, but has some substance, and is soft enough to bend!  It's not supposed to be like eating a pizza-flavored cracker.
3)  The sauce is sweet and bland.  It lacks any hint of basil or herbs that good NY pizza has.  Also...they put the sauce on top of the cheese.  I don't even know what to say about that.

On the flip side, the cheese is very good though.  They make it fresh, and it shows.  They just need to fix everything else, and maybe it will be good "NY style" pizza.  Until then, for east-coasters at least, it's just another gimmicky and ultimately disappointing California pizza place.< /text>

<Text>These guys went all out learning their craft by bringing in an expert from New York. They have a thin, super crispy crust, fresh mozzarella (made daily), a tasty sauce and lots of toppings. They even have Daiya cheese. It would be nice if they had a non-meat protein option (apparently I was the first person to ask) and a whole wheat crust (I forgot to ask about that one).< /Text><response>None< /response><time>1489635936915</time><name>Ed Miller< /name>< Gmap_id>

Have had most of their pizzas. Thin, crispy, light crust is just right. Toppings well matched. Owner is friendly. Three beers on tap but good ones. No doubt better than North Beach, which itself is very good.< /Text>

Flavors and ingredients aren't really inspiring. Dough was cooked well if you like think crust. Sauce was overpowering and very sweet. The quantity of cheese to pizza surface area was lacking.

Ordered the 7" provolone mozzarella Asiago and ricotta cheese pizza for 10.50 Way over priced for the food despite the area.

Probably would never come back.

I will say the mozzarella was quite good and you can purchase it alone.< /text>

I'm a Pizza nut and Chicago and New York have nothing on San Mateo when it comes to pizza as long as Velo City Pizza is around! Do yourself a favor and give FLAVORLAND a try, you won't regret. Sorry I just couldn't wait for the pic ;-)<//review>

<Review>Far from the familiar and commonplace pizza establishments, Velo City, incorporates its own low acid tomato topping, sauteed veggies, a delectable think crust, selection, customization if so desired.
Support your local businesses. Velo City will soon become your fave place to obtain your pie.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

<review>As someone with a lot of food sensitivities, it's fantastic to be able to talk to the owners, who great you very warmly, about the ingredients of thier mostly home made ingredients.
The buckwheat gluten free crust was delicious...Perfectly crunchy, something hard to accomplish with GF crusts.
Loved how the sauce was put on top, after the pizza was cooked.  The kids also loved thier pizzas, and easily ate them up.
Prices are standard SF pricey, but I don't see that as a problem when your able to actually enjoy the quality and understand what your eating.
We'll be back for sure, we love supporting local joints...<//review>< pictures>

Working our way through the gelato pops right now - definitely will have more than one favorite here!

Staff is always friendly & smiling - makes you want to come back.

Decor is cool & we always notice something different as we're sitting and enjoying our gelato popsicles...<//Review>

<date>1494122111025< /date><Text>Don't see this place lasting long. Decided to order pickup after a long day of landscaping. Said my pizza would be ready at 5:58p. I arrived at 5:58p and was greeted by nice Asian guy. Place was absolutely empty and apparently my order was still not ready. I took a seat and at 6:05p was told that it was ready but on the chicken pesto pizza they put red sauce which I did not want. Prolly would have been ok except I'm pregnant and was having a strong aversion to tomatoes. Guy offered it and I politely declined, he said ok we'll have to remake. I said ok and sat back down. He comes out with the wrong pizza and offers it again, showing me pizza. I say no thank you, AGAIN and say I will take it for my husband. He says oh no, I'm going to eat it! Ummkkk
Finally got food at 6:09. Ate 2 pieces on way to car. Pizza tastes good but not filling with thin crust. Definitely not a place to go when hungry/pregnant!
One star for price of food, slow service, and no compensation for mistake on their part.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This place is definitely somewhere you need to try if you’re looking for something different but still pizza. Me and my Boyfriend always try new pizza places looking for something different every time we travel up north and this is definitely different!

First and foremost the owners are AMAZING and so SWEET! If I went back it would be first and foremost because of how wonderful and kind they were.

Now for the taste, I’ll be honest the flavor gives me a middle eastern vibe and it’s not my favorite but that doesn’t make it bad pizza. The ingredients were fresh and even for a flavor I’m not big on it tasted amazing, you really HAVE to try this pizza once in your life because even if you don’t love it you can tell how much love is put into this place and the standard of quality they maintain!

You’ll never have a pizza like it!<//Text><date>1622336324617< /date><gmap_id>0x808f9ef8d25a50b5:0x295185c64650655<//gmap_id><user_id>114960271354685558546< /user_id></record>

<Text>Scott was helpful in assessing my needs since this was my first time getting a storage. Scott had me in and out faster than fast food while sharing with me my options in comparison. Definitely would recommend over the others; especially the cleanliness!< /Text>< Pics>

I can't say enough how terrific Scott and Richard is! I needed to get a small 5x5 storage unit that day. They are very understanding and listened to my situation.
We all know how google maps work when searching for a place. Though, don't let high reviews fool you, always visit them to see the location and talk with the staff in person.  Be kind and personable and you'll find out how they care about their work. Happy employees make for a happier business.  Anyhow.....

Upon researching online and visiting different Self Storage websites.... I've noticed there is a lot of online deals to be had right on their websites.  I narrowed it down to 4 different Self Storages. They all have very competitive prices online.  Though, one is way cheaper but does not compare to how well the other 3 maintain their properties.

Of the 4, I was able to narrow it down to just 2 Self Storages.  They both had great customer service, clean facilities, excellent security features and knew their business well.  Very close in rental prices online too.

Richard was helping me. Scott the manager, was helping another customer and I couldn't help but listen on the side. Great and awesome people!

Richard was able to answer all my questions and then some.  Security is top notch here.
- Gated with keypad
- Individually alarmed units
- Vented outside air into their facility. I couldn't find a climate controlled Self Storage around due to my time constraint and wanted to stay in carlsbad by Palomar Airport.
- They do use a special kind of lock that is set inside of the roll up doors with star keys. No hinges on their doors for padlocks. Another added security feature.  I don't mind.... I'll use StorQuest again in a heartbeat.
- Customer restroom. Well taken care of
- Surveillance system
- Free carts to use to move your goods
- Large Elevators
- Main building has a covered loading dock
- Well maintained
- Clean. Inside and out. Just a beautiful location
- Boxes and accessories if you need to buy.
- Go ask them about different leasing times.
- They do have different tiers on access times.  No 24 hour access.

- Though you have to buy storage rental insurance from them or provide your own.  An added cost, but I didn't mind for the price I was given.

Do check them out if you are looking! Check out their website first for availability and call if you have any questions about StorQuest. I feel very safe here and for my stuff.

I've added photos and a few videos of this place

P.S. All their doors are in the process of a color change.  Don't be alarmed if their outside doors are red and inside is blue. They are in the process changing it all to red.< /text>

< Review>
My experience with StorQuest Carlsbad was exactly what I had hoped for. I had no problem accessing my unit as much as I needed, and the managers at this facility were always extremely professional and helpful. Scott worked with me to identify a good location for my storage container for both moving in and moving out. There were no hidden fees, as Scott was very transparent about the costs upfront. I would absolutely store here again in the future.<//Review>

His expertise, professionalalism, knowledge and friendly manner really makes a difference and is the deciding factor for our decision to use this StorQuest location. He is also the 'why' behind our 5 star rating.
This is now our 3rd year with StorQuest and we can honestly say it is because of Scott that we remain loyal.
With regards to the facility, it is modern, clean, bright, safe and convenient.<//review><resp>{'time': 1518446623081, 'text': 'Evelyn – we’re so happy to hear that our facility and staff played a key role in making your storage experience a positive one.

<Review>I honestly have nothing bad to say. Your team was very helpful and polite and the extended hours worked great for me! I really needed that. The walk through was beneficial and the manager made things easy to understand-  glad we did that! Staff was always available too to answer my questions on site. Even on the phone- your staff was very respectful and knowledgeable about your place. Also, as a female, I felt safe staying there late, so thank you for that!  I would highly reccomend you guys! Many thanks!< /Review><name>Kat Kretch<//name>< userid>

<Review>StorQuest Carlsbad was perfect for what we needed. The place is clean, safe, and well-lit and easily accessible off El Camino Real and Palomar Airport Road. Scott was helpful and very informative. I wish we would have made the decision to use StorQuest earlier.</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>This storage facility and location is excellent. The manager, Scott Jedlick, is very personable and responsive, made our whole expericence renting two storage spaces easy. He really took care of us, and a nice guy! Had the lockers for over two years. The facility is clean, accessible, plenty of carts to move items from your car to your space. The storage facility is in a very nice business park in Carlsbad, very close to where I use to work.  Never had a bad experience with either the facility, management or other clients. Very reasonably priced as well given the location and shortage of spaces in the market.

When we did not need the lockers anymore due to a work relocation, Scott was excellent and took care of us. Five stars to the facility and the management, highly recommend StorQuest of Carlsbad!< /Review>< pics>

We’ve had a storage unit for about a year and never had any issues! The facility is clean and well lite, super secure and well maintained. We upgraded out unite to a 10x15 and their price is competitive with the neighboring businesses.
Scott the manager is amazing and helpful whenever we needed something!
Highly recommend this place</text>

<Text>Scott was professional, pleasant and incredibly helpful.  Very easy process.  Very clean location.  Competitive, if not the, best prices in the area.  I was at another storage company's location, which was filled with dust, debris and bugs. This place is CLEAN.

I was looking for an easy and affordable storage facility near my home. Not only was this the closest, but lowest cost. Scott the manager was helpful and efficient at getting me a unit and explaining how everything is managed. The facility is clean, safe, secure. Now I can get both my cars in the garage!</Review>

This review is for the Carlsbad location.
Scott and Richard have been excellent.
Very friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating. The facility is very clean and organized. After 11 years of using your facility we will be happy to recommend you.

I was in a hurry, so I told  Richard that I did t have time to look at the storage unit. He informed me that by law, he had to show me the storage unit before I sign on the dotted line. I was a little irritated, but due to the fact I needed a storage unit that day, I of course agreed. He told me that he would be quick and get me out of there as fast as he could, which I appreciated. Thank goodness Richard insisted on showing me the unit because I was shocked by how small it was. I appreciate the fact that  Richard didn’t cut corners, and actually did his job. And I also appreciate his promptness, because he did what he promised me; he got me out of there super fast. Richard ended up showing me a bigger unit and even though it cost my first born (aka super expensive) I decided to take it. The unit was more expensive than a number of other units I found. However, I felt a little better about paying more because for starters, all the security measure in place ensure that all the things I am storing in storage unit will be safe (knock on wood). Secondly, even though my storage unit was inside, on the second floor, I don’t mind paying more for accessibility. I was able to back my U-Hail a few feet away from the elevators and there are large  dollies/carts available if you need it. And I definitely needed to use them and it made things so much easier and allowed me to get everything stored and put away so much faster!! And lastly, I don’t mind paying more for great  service. Richard was so helpful and I appreciate him dotting every I and crossing every T to ensure that I was completely taken care of. Oh and by the way, Richard deserves a raise and a promotion.

Thank you!!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I just got a storage unit here today! Big thank you to Scott Jedlick, the manager at the Carlsbad location, who made the whole process of getting a storage unit super quick and easy. He had an answer for every question I had and was such a nice guy. As for the storage facility itself, the place is conveniently located in Bressi Ranch, right off of Palomar Airport Road. Everything is nice and new and the place is kept really tidy. The loading bay is covered and hand carts are available for easy loading and unloading. Super happy I picked this place to store all my extra stuff!< /review>

Scott Jedlick and Jessica, forgot her last name,  were very experienced in helping me decide which size storage to reserve for my house move out for our remodel.  Scott explained everything to me in an easy to understand manner, showed me the space and pointed out the features of the facility.  Jessica was also very knowledgeable about the facility and help me access my space the first time.  The security features of the facility were also explained and really sealed the deal.  I feel very confident our possessions will be safe and secure while we remodel our home.  I look forward to storing our things at StorQuest over the next year.< /Text>

Hands down the best customer experience I think I’ve ever had... for real, no hyperbole. Super efficient, respectful of people’s time, and staff that listens and responds with actual solutions.

Scott (seriously the nicest dude ever) saw that I was on a time crunch. He and his co-worker went above and beyond to get me exactly what I needed and set everything up within minutes. True professionals< /Review>

Scott Jedlick, the store manager, was super helpful. Even though we didn't have a reservation and there was limited space, Scott hooked it up and really helped us out. The place is super chill and I would recommend this to anyone who needs to store anything!</Review>

<pics>None</pics><text>I called more than 10 storage unit businesses to get pricing and unit information for a medium-sized unit.  With long-term or military discounts, StorQuest was by far the cheapest, saving me more than $300 in a year.  And so far from what I have experienced, the quality of service and professionalism is not diminished by the cheaper price.  Scott, the manager, and his associate Richard were amazing in helping us get settled into out unit.  Absolutely recommend.</text>< date>

I recently decided to close out my unit as I moved to a new place with lots of space. I hadn't realized that a 7 day notice to vacate was required and I was on the hook for the next month.

The StorQuest at Bressi Ranch has the most convenient location, close to both residential and commercial areas of Carlsbad. It is somewhat tucked away and has the feel of a secured place. It is clean and has plenty of loading carts available. I have been using it for a few years now and have always received great service. The store manager, Scott and his staff are friendly, communicative and helpful. Thank you!< /Text>

I don't usually like 5 stars reviews because they seem like they're from fake or insider or paid accounts to gush about a service.. but in this case it's warranted.

Scott is one of the most chill and professional people I've had the pleasure of doing business with. He was efficient in every way -- fast, thorough, and made the experience easy and enjoyable. Without a doubt a breath of fresh air. The facility is clean, safe, and well-kept, and the prices are amazing. I cannot commend Scott enough for his work and I would highly recommend this place to anyone.</review>

< Review>
Storquest has been a great company to store with. The site is always spotless, well maintained and safe. The best thing about the Carlsbad location is the staff.  Scott is an amazingly kind and thoughtful leader, and his customer service and expectations for the team he leads ensures that customers have a positive experience. I have been a customer for years and could have moved somewhere cheaper, but the people there make it worth the extra money.</Review>

<text>Scott and Richard are friendly, helpful and customer-service oriented.  I wasn't expecting such great service from a self-storage company, but I got it.  And it matters.  Their district manager, Edwin Murga was also a great help.  A very well managed facility with great staff.</text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Text>As someone looking to quickly source a space I was very much at the will of all the storage businesses in the Oceanside/Carlsbad area. And if you're currently doing research you know that the quality of storage businesses in the area aren't the best, both in management and pricing. I went to 4 different places between Oceanside and Carlsbad where I came across either rude/unhelpful management of exorbitant prices. Truly it felt I was going from one dirty used car salesman to another.

However, when I got to StorQuest in Carlsbad I was blown away by the employees and prices. I was helped in a way that made me feel as if it didn't matter if I was going to buy a storage unit or not, they were just trying to help solve one of my problems. Not only did they help source me a storage unit that was $30-$70 cheaper then any of the neighboring storage businesses but they also accommodated me closer to closing hours.

I would highly recommend this business and this specific location.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Review>I am a return customer, due to Scott's excellent,, professional service..
I just closed on my home and needed storage.  I remembered my past
experience at Storquest as very good.   Came in and signed up with Scott and it was like seeing and old friend.  He recommended  the perfect unit, I wasn't sure what I needed this time.  I am very thankful that Scott was at Storquest.  Best Company for storage,, clean spacious and easy access.</Review>< pics>

< review>
My schedule is very busy. I showed up at the StorQuest in the middle of the Manager's lunch. The closed sign was up but I didn't see it, and went in with the  UPS man.
The Manager put his lunch to the side, and went through the whole process  of helping me rent a storage unit.
I am very impressed with their level of security.
I have rented many storage units, this was by far the easiest process.
As I was leaving, two more people came in to rent a unit.
Even with being a very busy center, they gave great customer service.</review>

Scott, the store manager was very helpful.  I just moved to the area and he assisted in making sure I got the right size unit and walked me through the property, which is very clean as well as the office.  I would highly recommend this place.

The facility has been so convenient and easy that I came back for another unit.  Office personnel very friendly and helpful.<//Review>

I am doing some research on storage units in a couple of areas and Scott delightfully answers the phone and was very helpful, reassuring and spoke to many needs that I didn’t even realize I had. He spoke to many concerns that I had not considered and I really got that he knows people, our needs and what’s important to us as customers. Thank you for the time you spent explaining everything so thoroughly.</review>

Scott and Richard have both been a tremendous help when it came to renting a storage unit, and then needing to move to a new unit. They both are polite and very knowledgeable when it comes to the best unit for your budget. Thank you again for all your help.</Review>

Great experience in every aspect.  Scott and Richard are both amazing and really made a difference in the company.  As packages were delivered they both knew me by name, called if there were any problems, and were very helpful in management of my storage unit.  StorQuest itself was a great facility, but I can honestly say that the way it's managed is the biggest difference.< /Text>

<Text>Easily the best storage facility in North County. Premises is always clean and accessible. There are always plenty of carts for moving my items to and from storage. The staff member, Scott, is incredibly friendly and personable. He takes time to get to know me. That personal touch adds just that extra level of pleasant experience.

Facility is extremely secure, with several layers of access code. It’s the safest storage unit I’ve ever had. This is my second time at StorQuest Storage and I will never use another. I’d recommend anyone who needs short or long term storage to go with StorQuest here in Carlsbad.<//Text>< resp>

<review>I signed an online lease with StorQuest which made the process quite simple, however they left lots of questions and didn’t have me fully prepared to start using the unit. Upon arriving to StorQuest I was greeted by the manager Scott and his assistant Robbie. Scott informed me he was on break but Robbie could assist me. However, Scott ended up taking the entire time to answer any questions and make sure I was comfortable with all of storequest policies. This type of customer service is not found in the storage industry, and I am very thankful for Scott and Robbie’s assistance.</review>< pics>

This place is always so clean and the inside is temperature controlled. Plus the staff is always so pleasant, the manager Scott Jedlick, and Richard, are always so nice and helpful with everything, and if you ever see the District Manager Edwin Murga, he's really helpful, too! Can't say enough about this place, good security, cameras everywhere, this is the best place for the price!</text>

<review>I got a reasonable deal on line and expected a haste on location. Richard was professional and helpful and supported everything we were told online.  So far all is great.  Only surprise is our lock from extra space does not work at storquest.  Expect to pay an added $21 for their lock.
When vacating unit i was told over phone cost would be prorated and I would be rebated for unused time i already paid for. They did not do that in reality.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Hello,

I really didn't expect to receive the customer service I did. Scott Jedlick was amazing. He was so knowledgeable and took such good care of me. Its very rare to meet someone that you feel like your friends when the transaction is over. He is such a asset to your company and he made it easy.</Text>

We rented a unit for over 7 years and found the facilities to be consistently clean, easily accessible, very secure and a good value.

Scott was great explaining the rules and property layout. He also helped me lock in the best price for my storage needs. The prepay option is great for those of us that plan on storing items for a set period of time. They also had the best advertised price of any storage company in Carlsbad! The facility is clean, quiet, and easily accessible. Very happy I chose StorQuest.< /Review>

<text>I looked at several several self storage facilities before I found Storquest.  This is a great location and is very easy to access.  But......  what really sets you apart from the competition is Scott.  You are very fortunate to have him as the manager.  He is absolutely amazing.   Richard is excellent, as well.  Always very friendly and helpful. As a former business owner, I understand how difficult it can be to find good people who care about the business as much as you do.  Scott has that true sense of ownership and pride in what he does , and that is such a rare quality in this day and age.  Make sure you take good care of him!!  :)</text><name>Joyce Novak</name><Time>1558035900037</Time><Rating>5< /Rating></record></dataset><record>

Scott and Richard were both incredibly helpful. Richard made sure that I got the right size unit for me, walked me through the various procedures for security and understanding my locking mechanism, and was all around a pleasant guy to talk with.

The storage itself is kept incredibly clean and always has carts and other necessities for moving things to and from my unit. This is the only place I feel secure in storing my personal belongings.

10/10, would store again.< /Review>

<Review>I have to start by saying that the last thing I ever want to do is move again… However in the last few years I’ve moved several times.   Scott has been amazing and put up with me the last few years! He has gone above and beyond and making sure that my storage experience was effortless and hassle free!  Scotts ability to genuinely care and accommodate my needs made everything so much easier! Even this last week when I had to cancel my storage unit because I ended up having a change of plans,  Scott went above and beyond once again and making sure that everything I needed was taken care of… Not to mention even offering to take my lock off my storage unit so I wouldn’t have to walk!!!!! I will definitely be coming back if I ever need storage unit again! Thank you again Scott for everything!<//Review><response>{'time': 1558924942402, 'text': "Hi Kelly, we're very happy to have provided you with such a positive experience!

My husband and I stopped by after work on Mon 1/28 for a rental storage. We had already booked a space online. It was near closing time an the young gentleman helped us through a quick and easy process. He was very kind, informative and showed us every step needed to get to our unit. Would recommend! Thank you!<//Review>

Clean, super nice management, high tech, but what really put it over the edge was the security. I am super pleased with their cylinder lock system. None of the others had this & it’s one of the most secure. So happy with this company. Scott, the manager, was so fantastic and helpful! He sat down and talked us through everything and answered all of our questions.</text>< pictures>

Would give 10 stars if I could! You can tell when someone is perfect for their job, and manager Scott's professionalism and conscientious communication moved me to write this review. He and Caesar were so friendly and helpful from the beginning, and have continued to impress. The facility is state of the art and impeccably clean and so well maintained. But the way Scott goes above and beyond in making sure you understand everything clearly and making sure your individual needs are perfectly met takes the cake!<//text>

We've used this facility for six years and have much appreciated the friendly and efficient service provided by Scott. We changed our unit size a couple of times as our needs changed and he always went out of his way to make the process as smooth as possible. The facility is clean and well-maintained and we would recommend it to anyone needing storage.</Review>

My husband comes to visit our stuff and add more weekly. It’s extremely convenient and clean. We’re now moving out into our own place again but Richard and Scott are wonderful.

Scott, Richard, and the rest of the StorQuest Carlsbad staff provided excellent service throughout my 6-month lease with them.  They were engaging and always helpful, which gave me great peace of mind that my unit was safe and secure.  The facility itself was always clean and tidy.  I’ve used three different storage facilities in the Oceanside/Carlsbad area and this one has been the best.</text>

The facility is clean, well-maintained, safe and in a great location.  Scott (manager) was very helpful.

The entire staff was always friendly, and helpful. The facility is always clean, secure, and worth every dollar spent.  I have used other nationwide storage facilities before, and StorQuest has been the overall best that I've used over the years! Highly recommended since 2016!

I need a storage unit unexpectedly at the minute and I went back to Storquest to see if they could accommodate me.  Thankfully they did, and was glad to see that Scott was still there and continued to provide 5 star customer service with a smile. I must also to give Kudos to Sam who helped me in every way possible in getting my account set up, as I had forgotten my reading glasses and was in a rush against the clock. Thanks again to Scott and Sam, you guys rock!<//text>

Scott the manager is very nice and has addressed several concerns of mine very professionally and gone out of his way to make sure I am a satisfied customer. Facility is great, very clean and up to date. Probably the nicest I’ve used, and I’ve used quite a few. Very reasonable price and great location also. Highly recommend.<//review>

Rented here for 5 years. I tell everyone how clean it is and the Manager Scott is great!

I am adding that it’s been six years now with StorQuest and, as in the above comment, I would not move from there if I lived in Los Angeles!  Scott is meticulous in keeping the place clean and he is positive and thorough in the business end.  Both Scott and Richard are terrific.  If Scott moved to another store I would go with him. I have brought in a few customers since I have been at StorQuest and they feel the same.  Thank you.</Review>

I have been using the Carlsbad StorQuest location for a couple years. It has served my needs wonderfully as a temporary location for some belongings while I relocated. When I visited my storage unit, I was often greeted by the friendly staff. Scott stood out as an incredibly hard worker and was always able to help when I needed questions answered. He is truly an asset and one reason I didn't move out sooner. Thank you StorQuest and mostly thank you Scott.< /text>

<Text>This is the second time we have rented a storage unit at this facility. We were happy 10 years ago and happy again this year. It still is as clean and "new" as it was a decade ago. It still looks like it just opened!
Even more importantly is the outstanding treatment we received from the building manager, Scott. He was warm, friendly and engaging. He gave us his full attention to our storage needs. It is such a rarity to receive such great customer service in this industry. We were pleased to find the ideal space for our needs and also so pleased to work with this great professional.

Super helpful and professional. The facilities are the best you’ll find anywhere. Not sure how cost compares to a lot of other places but absolutely worth it. Convenient entry and elevator in the back gets us really close to where we need to get to for the unit.</Text>

This facility is the best storage place I have ever used. It is very clean and very secure. The staff is courteous and very professional. We have dealt with Scott Jedlick (manager) several times (first time was totally remote from NorCal) and he always goes the extra distance to make you feel comfortable and remove any worries.

< Review>
Richard at StorQuest Storage/ Bressi Ranch was great today! He went over our lease option in detail, took us to see our storage unit and was very professional, patient, and detailed in explaining the process of entering the facility and utilizing the elevator and exiting. Our customer experience with Richard was excellent! His Manager Scott evening took time to say hi to us while we were in the office area. I would definitely recommend anyone and everyone to bring your business here. The facility is clean and well maintained and secure. Thank you Richard for all your help today and welcome to Carlsbad !<//Review>

If the days ahead are anything like this initial experience, I am confident this review will never need amending.
The manager Scott was very thorough and patient. He explained everything completely and clearly. That is surprisingly unusual in this business. He gave us good advice and made no attempt to upsell or parade me through an endless array of packing and moving supplies. He also explained the contract and potential ways we might save money.  All that and he is a great guy.
This has already been the best storage experience I've ever had.

Ok, we had our precious belongings here for a couple months and my original review in the paragraph above this stands. Everytime I have visited my stuff the entire place is spotless and secure. Scott and Richard provided excellent customer service on our exit, and frankly, they are also nice guys.

I'm too old to put up with BS. This storage facility is top-notch and gives you a "no muss no fuss"
experience.</Text></record>

they are great!  they have specials of paying in advance or auto pays and they work with you on your move in and move out.  the  unit itself was clean.  the gate access is helpful and security is top.  the customer service agent is always around the grounds and helpful.  we would definitely recommend to others and go back if we moved back to the area.</Review>

<text>Easy online booking service.  The manager, Scott Jedlick, was very helpful and informative - he took the time to show us several storage options and explained several pricing options for longer term storage.  The units are clean, neat, well lit.

This is an update to a review a year ago - I just emptied out our unit after about a year's use.  Once again, Scott took the time to explain all my options on timing for clearing out the unit and made the process simple.  He then called to follow up to see if I needed anything else and has gone to bat for me to get a refund for the extra month plus I had prepaid.  I cannot thank Scott enough for all his help and professionalism.  He is always a joy to speak with and most helpful.  StorQuest is very lucky to have him on staff.  Thanks Scott!<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<review>I was greeted very nicely today by a gentleman by the name of Ron. I immediately asked for Scott as he has been my go to person for years. Ron totally understood and just so happened Scott was returning from lunch and was able to help me. I have had units at this facility for years in Carlsbad and have always totally loved this facility. It is perhaps the cleanest facility I have used. I currently have one in Oceanside and that is why I'm here today. There is not anyone  available to help me in Oceanside with my concers and it definitely is not kept as well as this facility so I'm here for another unit!!

<Text>I have rented a storage unit at StorQuest for the last 5 years. Scott, the manager, as well as the staff are friendly, courteous, and always ready to help. StorQuest is extremely clean, well-maintained, and safe, as well as security-minded. I have been very happy with StorQuest and would not hesitate to recommend it to my friends. Definitely earns 5 stars!< /Text><response>{'time': 1521466879164, 'text': 'Carolyn, thank you for this wonderful feedback about Scott, our team, and our facility.

< Review>
So, we finally caved and got a storage unit after YEARS of debating and procrastinating.  We looked at the various options around the area, and StorQuest was by far the best.  The cleanest, most accessible, safest, and best customer service.  Scott was our rep and he was fantastic.  He showed us our options and helped us decide which of the available units were the best for our particular needs.   We feel really good about our decision!< /Review>

Exceptional Security!  Excellent Customer Service!  I had a good experience with them.  Also, the manager stayed late to help me when they closed at 7pm.

Scott gives beyond amazing service!!  He really takes care of you!  This place is a gem!< /review>

<Text>Easy online booking service.  The manager, Scott Jedlick, was very helpful and informative - he took the time to show us several storage options and explained several pricing options for longer term storage.  The units are clean, neat, well lit.

This is an update to a review a year ago - I just emptied out our unit after about a year's use.  Once again, Scott took the time to explain all my options on timing for clearing out the unit and made the process simple.  He then called to follow up to see if I needed anything else and has gone to bat for me to get a refund for the extra month plus I had prepaid.  I cannot thank Scott enough for all his help and professionalism.  He is always a joy to speak with and most helpful.  StorQuest is very lucky to have him on staff.  Thanks Scott!</Text>< Name>

< review>
I highly recommend this storage facility! Scott and Vince provide excellent customer service & communication. The facility is impeccably clean, the location is great and the hours work really well for my lifestyle. Pricing is competitive for other storage places in the area,  but I do feel I was given a good promo when I moved in. It's great to feel safe & secure while most of my belongings are being stored away from me. I love that they have motion activated lights in the building so that energy is conserved when not in use. I also prefer to frequent businesses who support our local troops and veterans and these guys really do what they can. (I'm from a military family but not in the service myself). Although I definitely don't want to store "my life" forever, I'm really happy with this place and will stay there as long as need be and recommend them to anyone who needs storage in North County.< /review>

This is one of the cleanest, well kept storage facilities I have ever seen. The manager Scott keeps everything organized and runs this place very well. Dana was also there today and showed me around the property. She is very friend and extremely helpful too. Great customer service from everyone.</Text>

<Text>I am a retired Cop who was looking for a safe place to store my stuff. I want security, security  and morr security! When I arrived at StorQuest Carlsbad Scott and his coworker went out of their way to help me and address my questions about security. As it turns out this facility is built like Ft. Knox with many levels of security in place. A couple  of examples....the units are alarmed individually and only people renting on a floor can access that floor. I rented a unit. The application process was easy. I would highly recommend this place to keep your possessions safe.<//Text>< Resp>

Over the years (and in various locales), I’ve had a number of storage units, and I can say without a doubt that my experience at StorQuest - Carlsbad / Campbell has been one of the best, if not the best, storage-unit experience I’ve had.

First off, this place is CLEAN! Other places just don’t come close to the attractiveness and cleanliness of this place. And second, and high up on the list: both the manager, Scott Jedlick and his assistant, Richard offer great customer service. Prior to getting this storage unit, I checked out several places (over the phone and in person). During this period (person and phone), I talked to both Scott and Richard and they explained things well and came across as very professional, plus the rate I was quoted was extremely competitive. I got a 10’ X 15’ unit with StorQuest that was less expensive that some other places’ 10’ X 10’ units.

I was a little hesitant about a second story unit, but Richard pointed out the dollies around the facility and with being able to park right next to the elevator (and with my unit being close to the elevator), I found that my initial fears were unwarranted. It was easy to access my unit, and to move things in and out of it.

At this place, they have you purchase a cylinder lock (~ $20.00 plus tax) to lock your unit. This is a very secure type of lock! In the past, at another storage facility, I had my lock cut open and my unit broken into. When I told this to StorQuest manager, Scott, he explained how secure and virtually-tamper proof these cylinder locks are.

There was one more thing that I really liked about this place: after punching in your code at the entrance, the buildings are arranged so that you drive (in one direction) in a big square and exit at the other side (where you again punch in your code for the exit gate to open). This seemed safer to me than cars and trucks coming and going in different directions, and like I said before, I was able to park right next to the elevator in my building. The driving space/path between the buildings was quite adequate so that cars and trucks could easily pass around cars parked to the side.

I had my unit at StorQuest for about 6 months until I could arrange to move my items out, and Scott was extremely helpful on my last day there (extending my gate access hours by two hours to accommodate my needs). If I ever need a storage unit again, and am in this North County area, I’d definitely use StorQuest - Carlsbad / Campbell again!</text>

Scott the manager helped me get the information I needed to rent the unit in the facility in Carlsbad. Then Paula finished the paperwork, showed the unit and put the lock on and answered my questions. Both made it easy to rent and move in.</Text>

Great experience and very clean storage facility.  One of the best I have been into over my years.  Ron was very helpful and showed us several units until we found the one that was perfect of us.  I highly recommend!</text>

I highly recommend this storage facility! Scott and Vince provide excellent customer service & communication. The facility is impeccably clean, the location is great and the hours work really well for my lifestyle. Pricing is competitive for other storage places in the area,  but I do feel I was given a good promo when I moved in. It's great to feel safe & secure while most of my belongings are being stored away from me. I love that they have motion activated lights in the building so that energy is conserved when not in use. I also prefer to frequent businesses who support our local troops and veterans and these guys really do what they can. (I'm from a military family but not in the service myself). Although I definitely don't want to store "my life" forever, I'm really happy with this place and will stay there as long as need be and recommend them to anyone who needs storage in North County.<//Text>

I have rented 2 units at the Carlsbad/Bressi Ranch location.  Both Scott and Richard have been friendly and efficient, and have gone out of their way to be accommodating.  In the service world their professionalism and willingness to help are seldom encountered any longer, but certainly most welcomed.  If a trip to DMV is at one end of the service scale, Scott and Richard are at the opposite end!</review>

Storage facility is nice and clean and very secure.  Scott Jedlick the property manager was extremely helpful.  He would always come out to greet me when I drove up and when I was moving my things into storage he made sure there was a cart available.

Five or more years ago I had a great experience with StoreQuest Storage and Scott Jedlick was also in charge then.  Recently, I had the need for a storage unit and was thrilled to see that Scott was still there.  The facility is sparkling clean, has great customer service and the best deal around to boot.<//Text>

I recently was looking for a storage unit in the area. After reading some bad reviews of other places I stumbled across StorQuest. The reviews seemed legit so I decided to give it a look.

This was the first time I have ever rented a storage unit and most people don't get excited about storage units so I was skeptical.

I walked in and was greeted by Scott. First impression was fantastic. He was friendly and helpful. He walked me to through the whole process. Then he walked me to the unit I was about to rent. The hallways were clean, storage unit was in great shape, the indoor units are air conditioned, and they have security codes to protect your unit.

The following day I moved my stuff in. I pulled up to the gate and he came outside and greeted me with a smile. The move in went seem less (even though I was on the second floor). Moved right in and left without any issues.

VERY happy with StorQuest. If you are looking for a storage unit in the area I would highly recommend giving them a look. Chances are you will also be impressed.

Thanks Scott!</Text>

The facilities are spic n span. One of the best maintained and looking storage places I’ve ever used. Once I lost my keys during one of my visits and Scott Jedkick, the Manager, stayed well after regular office hours to help me find it.  So thankful. Above and beyond call of duty! I recommend StorQuest and Scott Jedlick 100%.<//text>

I recently signed a year long lease on a storage unit with StorQuest.  Ron was the manager I worked with and he was fantastic.  He was knowledgeable, kind and professional.  I had several concerns about storage facilities in general, as I had surveyed many of them in the area.  Most facilities allow transients to make storage units their residence.  When touring such facilities, I personally witnessed transients smoking crack and letting their pit bulls run loose on the premises.  But, Ron made clear that they didn't allow such conduct on their premises.  He explained the top notch security of this facility and that they don't allow riff raff to inhabit the premises, which was of particular importance to me since I'm storing highly confidential documents.  No joke, I surveyed probably 20 facilities in the Carlsbad/Oceanside area and this is by far and away the best one.  Thanks, Ron!< /review>

<review>When it comes to storage, there aren't a lot of requirements (for me at least):
- accessible for long hours (early or late)
- clean
- secure
- not shady

StorQuest exceeded my expectations in all these areas. I was making runs late in the evening, which was helpful for my situation. Reasonably priced, close to home, very secure. They even have flatbed carts for use - which was super helpful. If I need storage in Carlsbad again, I'll go back here no question.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1436200948814, 'text': 'We appreciate your positive feedback, John!

StorQuest Bressi Ranch staff and facility are leaps and bounds above other local storage facilities.  Ron was very helpful explaining options and procedures on how the facility operates. The facility is clean, safe, well lit and ventilated. The access hours also make it very convenient for early or late access.</review>

<text>They are the best.

Temperature control very good (best I've seen); very clean; very well lighted; good fire protection system and policies, a modern, multi-level security system, close access to all units; and the friendly staff is helpful and efficient with whatever you need (specialty boxes, bigger unit(s), etc.).  I looked at half a dozen local places -- they all looked fairly good -- before choosing StorQuest -- it looked better -- and will definitely use them again if the need arises.  And best of all: You can look up (if you're outside) and maybe see a P-51 Mustang or a B-17, (but usually a corporate jet) less than 500 feet above you (it's just south of the normal Palomar Airport landing path, kitty-corner to the end of the runway)!  (Admittedly, if your boxes of old books and grandma's heirloom furniture is truly priceless to you, then for perfect security I suppose being nearly right under the approach to the busiest single-runway airport in the country is not a feature.  But if it means that much to you, you really need a different level of security/storage anyway! :-))<//text>< date>

<review>Storquest in Carlsbad is newer and very clean, which are a couple of the reasons I like it.  The staff, Scott and Vince are super friendly and helpful.  The hours are convenient and there are plenty of carts available to use.  It's very organized and getting in and out is a breeze.

<Date>1383504855127</Date><Rating>5< /Rating><Review>We rented 3 units from them recently and opened them with 3 different employees there, and found them all to be extremely helpful, knowledgeable, personable, friendly and professional. Scott, Isaiah and Vince are great!

We had never rented a storage unit before, so wasn't sure what to expect, but this place exceeded all of our expectations. Even with 3 units, we never had a single issue arise where we couldn't get in, find a cart, or feel insecure.

Safety and security were a prime concern of ours, and though no place can be 100% secure, we found this StorQuest to be in a good, safe area. The units are accessible only to patrons.

Cost-wise, it's very reasonable, and the guys will work with you to give you the best rate they can.

We highly recommend this facility.< /Review>< pics>

Scott J was very helpful and very professional.  We liked that the entire location was clean.  Scott provided us with a lot of details and information of what StorQuest provides.  We like that there are hand carts available on-site and the ease of finding the individual units -- clearly-marked signs to guide you in the long hallways.  We were especially impressed with the security of every storage unit and the overall location.  Scott was very friendly and informative (answered all our questions) in rental contractual requirements, payment methods, access times, fire protection, and Storquest's elaborate security system.  He listened to our needs and what we were looking for, storage-wise.  Thank you to Scott, for the wonderful tour!  We were so impressed with everything that we signed up almost immediately.  The promo is nice, of course!   Thank you, Storquest!< /Text>

Scott, Vince and Ron have customer service down!  I have been renting from the Carlsbad location for almost 5 years now.  I am also a lifetime storage renter!  This weekend I needed another unit for my elderly mother who is leaving her home after 50+ years!   It is a moving nightmare!  I rented one size then needed a larger size the day of the move.  Both Scott and Ron took over made the change as seamless as possible, and were happy to do it!  Wish everything was this easy!  Thank you all!<//Review>

I know I am a stranger on the internet but if you are reading this and need a storage unit, stop and rent here. The facility is impeccably maintained, the security of the facility is top notch, and the staff is amazing. Scott is amazing, he personally saw to my needs and requests to ensure I was happy with my storage needs. I will tell you that I would not store my stuff anywhere but here. I am moving 40 miles away and if I ever needed a storage unit again I would make the drive, it’s THAT good. Honestly look at other storage places in the area and then look here, you will end up renting at Storquest it’s not even close.< /Review>

I just finished up my second experience with this storage facility and will plan to use them again.  They are always very helpful at the front desk and the property manager Scott takes the time to get the right unit and unit location for you.  This is a very clean facility and clean units that never have that musty storage facility odor.  Overall, I would recommend them to anyone wanting to have a professional property storage experience!</Text>

This place is clean and well kept and it was unfair of me to give Scott a mediocre rating.  He does a good job and will go out on a limb for his tenants.  What I didn't know about StorQuest is they do automatic rate increases, like everybody else, in certain months of the year.  To avoid this rate increase, the tenant can opt to pay upfront for a long term lease (6 mos.) to lock in their rate.  I don't believe other storage facilities offer this.  Based upon this new information, I have revised my rating to a Five Star.  This is a nice facility where you're stuff is safe and protected.
It's too bad there aren't more storage facilities to provide competition hereby keeping the rates low. Us Baby Boomers like to hold onto our old stuff in case we need to sell it to make ends meet.<//Review>

From time to time we must adjust rental rates to keep pace with the costs of maintaining a topnotch facility. We notify customers 30 days in advance to ensure they are aware of any changes taking place. However, we do offer long term discounts for customers who prepay six months to a year in advance, which locks in their rate for that period of time. We’d appreciate the opportunity to speak with you to gain a better understanding of your situation and encourage you to give us a call at your convenience 800-784-9176.'}<//resp>< Gmap_id>

I watched this facility get built from my nearby office in Carlsbad and soon became one of their first customers. I have always been impressed with their professional appearance, clean, pest free environment, well organized, brightly lit, very secure facility and ease of monthly payment. Scott Jedlick has always been there to help me with great customer service whenever I have needed assistance. There are other storage facilities closer to my home in Oceanside, but I am willing to make the drive to Carlsbad because Bressi Ranch Storquest is just THAT good.</text>

<review>I'm a longtime renter at Carlsbad Stor Quest (2009-2013) and am currently, almost 2 years.  Scott Jedlick has been genuinely supportive and gracious throughout this time, all the while maintaining a professional, effective office and making sure the premises are clean and functional.  Compared to other storage facilities I have experienced, Carlsbad Stor Quest is by far the best in every aspect....I attribute this to Scott's professionalism and work ethic.  Thank you Scott!</review><Date>1519713262972</Date>< pictures>

The facility is secure, clean, well-organized and easy to access, Scott is very attentive to customer requests, is highly professional and personable and it is obvious that the place is well managed. The pricing is competitive for the area and we would definitely recommend the facility to friends,</review>

<Text>At the end of a 9+ hour day of packing, lifting, and driving, it is dark outside and all you want to do is be over with moving; you meet Scott Jedlick. What a refreshing surprise. I even called him prior to arriving to say we were going to be later than anticipated and he was so nice about everything. First off when you walk into the office, it is spotless, the bathroom is clean, holiday decor is up and Scott stands up and greets you, talk about amazing customer service. The storage unit we had was a little to small so he showed us another option and it was perfect. Being it was just after 5:30pm and he was about to leave around 6pm he advised that if we had any issues to call the emergency number. It was new place, first time seeing the premises and already I felt like he was a close friend. Though we may not be visiting our storage unit too much, I am so thankful to have met Scott and he just lightens anyones day, great customer service and goes above and beyond.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I can't say enough about StorQuest Self Storage in Carlsbad / Bressi Ranch.  What a first class operation!   When I visited, I was greeted warmly and professionally by Property Manager Scott Jedlick.   He made my decision to rent here so easy!  He couldn't do more to ensure all my questions were answered and that I had all the information I needed to make an informed decision.  The property is beautiful and I couldn't be more confident that my belongings are safe and secure.  In all my subsequent dealings with Scott and his staff, I always receive first class service.  Every interaction is a personal experience.  They care.  I can't say enough good things about his facility and how well it is run.  Anyone looking for a place to store their belongings should most definitely go to StorQuest - particularly Bressi Ranch.  There are many storage options but StorQuest is by far the best value I have seen for such a high quality, top of the line facility and operation.  Many thanks to Scott and his team for taking such good care of us!  These folks are clearly #1!  Exceptional!<//review>

Absolutely the best in North County and anywhere elses I've been for that matter... moving, storing, heck let's face it "life" is FULL of OMG this SUCKS moments... and in the middle of absolute frustration the staff at this place has been stellar. Vince and Scott have now on multiple occasions gone out of there way to make my life easier. The units are super clean...zero odor. All the access points including the large elevators are secured with a keypad which takes some getting used to, but the locks are super easy once you get the hang of it and you always leave the place with just no worries that your stuff will be well kept. You can't go wrong here... true problem solvers.<//text>

This is my third time I have rented from StorQuest. Once in Temecula with a 10 x 25 and more recently upsizing from a 10 x 13 to a 10 x 25 in Carlsbad.
The staff at both locations was very helpful and friendly at all times!
There are two things that would have made my experience with using them a lot more remarkable:
1) a trash dumpster. Bite the bullet you guys! People will take advantage of this and it will cost you some, but the amount of $ your company makes monthly, every month for very little work to keep customers coming back?
2) the monthly rent on the 10 x 25 in Temecula $241 and the same size in Carlsbad $370??? WHY and no returning customer break?
I will endeavor to get rid of all my storage possessions soon as I cannot justify this expense at 66 years old!

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>StorQuest Self Storange, is without a doubt, one of thee most professionally/friendly run businesses that I've had the pleasure in patronizing.

Believe it or not, I had attempted to rent a storage unit, at the U-Haul facility right down the road. They didn't have any units available in the size that I was seeking, so their manager referred me to, StorQuest. IMO, this speaks volumes; the fact that the competition would recommend a competitior.

Reason's why I highly recommend, StorQuest:

1, Their staff. Both Scott, & Vince are extremely professional, & were ALWAYS a pleasure interacting with. The front office is immaculate, efficient, & highly organized.

2. Best bang for the buck! This is a 5 Star facility. My storage unit, was actually cheaper than U-Haul, & much nicer!

3. Meticulously clean (even their bathrooms;).

4. Awesome location.

5. Safe!

FWIW: I can only assume, that the CEO of this business enterprise, must have a degree in, Business Management. With that said, it's the intangibles (things you can't teach), that make a business outshine it's competition. SQ, is in a class of their own!

The highest recommendation: 5 STARS!!!!!

Thank you!

They need more than 1 employee working at a time. You may end up waiting for 20 or more minutes in front of the office if they are out on an errand, showing a customer a unit, etc.<//text>

Driving up to it I thought " this is going to be pricey". I was pleasantly surprised after inquiring within that they are not only competitive with other major brand storage locations in the Carlsbad area but even cheaper when you compare apples to apples- oranges to oranges. The location is perfect for the tri-city area (central Carlsbad) next to two major thorough fares ( Palomar Airport Rd. and El Camino Real ). The facility itself is state of the art as far as storage facility technology (climate controlled, entry gate and unit access security ect...). Most important for me is that it is fully fire sprinklered for fire protection. In the past I suffered a major loss of heirloom items in a storage unit fire in Henderson, NV involving about ten units which did not have any fire protection systems. Insurance covered the loss but most items were not replaceable. Lastly, a big thanks to Scott Jedlick and his staff for outstanding customer service and running a tight ship!</text><rate>5<//rate>< user>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Review>I've had a lot of experience moving around throughout my career, and as a result, to rent storage units a number of times in the last 25 years. This is by far the best. I have been so impressed with StorQuest at Bressi Ranch Self Storage, and the manner in which they conduct themselves, their business and treat their customers. I have been a StorQuest Bressi Ranch customer/tenant now for about 5 years, and I must say, it's been the best experience that I've ever had with any self-storage organization, anywhere!  The facility is always clean, well maintained and looks great. Scott Jedlick and Vince are just top notch; always helpful, friendly and efficient. They go out of their way to make you feel at home, comfortable, and work through whatever issues you might have, to make your experience absolutely the best. Their customer service is nothing short of exceptional.

In particular, Scott Jedlick, the property manager, has been amazingly helpful.  He has helped me identify my storage needs and he always takes the time to explain my options. His terrific customer service is always above and beyond, and exceeds my expectations ... I don't know that I have ever had such impressive customer service with any company. I am blessed to have found this facility, and feel so grateful and thankful to have Scott looking out for my best interests.  I highly recommend this facility to EVERYONE who has storage needs.

We will continue to use Bressi Ranch/StorQuest Self Storage for all of our storage needs.
