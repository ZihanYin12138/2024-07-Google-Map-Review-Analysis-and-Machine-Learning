<Review>Petco has an veterinarian clinic called Thrive which is reasonably priced and they sent me this picture of my pup, Martini after his appointment.  Highly recommend to pet owners.< /Review><user>106193294459456444523< /user><response>None<//response></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Went to purchase a standard set up for a beta fish, had a decent amount of choices to choose from and had a list of each beta fish for what they were each worth. Got a ordinary bowl, pebbles, a decoration, food and some drops. Didn't know much about these fish, so the cashier was nice enough to tell me I had the correct things and gave me a paper that had everything about the fish and its habitat. Overall super satisfied, and still happy.<//Review>

<resp>None</resp><Text>This place is no good and much worse than any other Petco I have been to. There was a coupon today for 15% when you spend $50+ in store and it ended up being a big scam. I was going to bulk buy litter with it. I had previously spoken to a petco.com representative today and asked her if I can use that coupon and have the store price match what's on Petco.com. The Petco.com representative said yes. I called the store in advanced and told the manager I'd like to use the coupon on 3 boxes of litter and use the 15% off coupon and to place the items on hold. After driving an hour, I get there and the guy at the cashier can't find the boxes of litter. I waited 5 minutes for him to locate it. Then I was told I can't use the 15% off coupon and price match with Petco online. The online prices were cheaper than 15% off store full price so I could have stayed home! To make matters worse, they told me this after making me wait 20 minutes standing in the store during COVID while the manager was socializing on the phone and they couldn't get a hold of her. The part that really got me was they took $20 of my petco pals rewards before I even bought the litter and was unable to put it back on my account when I said to cancel it and I'll buy the litter later. I was put in a situation where I had to buy the item to get my $20 back and help the store manager out for poor service which wasn't cool. The manager also told me that in store coupon is just to drive people into the store in person and not for online pricing. Who tries to drive people into stores during a massive world wide pandemic where state officials are saying it's mandatory to stay at home unless it's essential? Los Angeles has over half a million COVID cases right now and nearly 9K deaths and it is constantly growing. Sounds like they are trying to kill pet parents to top it off...<//Text>< GmapID>

The staff was so helpful with absolutely everything. My expectations for customer service has been so low with every place that I go and both Sara and Sarah were amazing. They were very personable, knowledgeable and felt like they were looking out for me. They were also sensitive to the passing of one of my cats. I will now only go to this Petco for this very reason.< /text>

This Petco store always have a great selection of pet products, and their associates are all very friendly and helpful. The grooming station does a great job and everyone there is always very nice to me and great to my dog.

Recently, during these extremely trying times, I went in and the store was fully stocked and the associate at the register was cheery, friendly and very helpful. A smiling face goes a long long way these days. Highly recommended.< /review>

My kids wanted a hamster for the longest time. I never had one and was bit worried about taking care of hamster.. Dan answered all our questions even the most basic ones with a smile and patience.. he was really awesome with my kids excitement.. and helpful with all our choices for hamster’s new home, food, toy etc.  other staff passing by us, and at the cashier’s counter all helped this event even more happier one for my kids. They talked to them like young adults with courtesy and lots of patience. As a parent.. this was a bonus.  This place is by far the best petco location I have been to. It is about 20 minutes from my house but I would choose to return to this location even though there are other petco and petsmart closer<//text>

We love this Petco! All of the staff is super friendly and helpful. We’ve gone to puppy playtime (weekends 1-1:30p and it’s free!) pretty much every week since we got our pup and it’s been great for her! The trainers are amazing and clearly love what they do. We’ve also taken her for grooming a couple of times and not only did we love the results but they’re so great with her that she’s never scared to go back!<//review>

Rudely stopped and  questioned by one of the workers. I was waiting in line and everyone else in front of me she didnt bother to stop and ask this " does your dog have all his shots ?" And she also commented " I'm making sure the dog is fine." I felt discriminated and will be reaching out to corporate wondering if this is the kind of people they hire. This is disappointing and not customer service.</text>

They've got the best prices.  Always check the online price before going into the store.  That way, the sales people can match it.</text>

<date>1595099797484</date><review>Review of pet grooming.  Petco has curbside drop off your dog for pet grooming. The groomer, Jamie, is awesome with our dog Kona. Kona goes along with Jamie, tail wagging, with not even a look back at me. She accepts the medicated shampoo that we purchased from the vet. When we receive him back he's happy and smelling wonderful. He had some skin problems due to allergies so Jamie gave him a hot oil treatment free, to demonstrate how well it improved his coat. He was soooooo soft and shiny.< /review><UserId.>102755726811732053117</UserId.><resp>None< /resp>< pics>

The store was very clean. It was easy to navigate and find what I was looking for. I came to pick up an online order and ended up going inside as well to pick up some treats from the pet bar. My only complaint would be that the store didn't have strawberry biscotti treats. But I know it's shipping's been difficult because of COVID 19 and it's no one at the stores fault. The girl at the checkout was also extremely helpful, but I can't remember her name. :(</text>

< Review>
When I need pet supplies, this is my go-to location.

I usually come here for fish supplies. This store seens to have a consistently wide array of bettas in good condition. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and in the past I was able to ask some questions and build my confidence as a novice fish keeper before the dawn of all the online groups. It isn't the largest fish section, but I consider it one of the best.

They always offer to help and seem to know their stuff. Not all retailers have educated employees, so it is great to know that these folks try to be familiar with animal care. The asoption events seem well organized, and the dogs visiting for training classes (or doggy daycare?) all seem happy when I pass by. If the standards of the fish secrion are upheld throughout the store (I am sure it is), this is a fantastic shop.< /Review>

<text>It's smells. Also looks weird, the shelves and ceiling. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They just didn't have what I needed for my hammy. And their hamster section was a little scarce. However for other animals like dogs and cats I believed they had a good selection. I'm giving 4 stars because of the location, and semi off putting vibe of their sign, and when you walk in (stinky and looks weird)</text>< UserId.>

Will not look up reciepts. Everything in stores is computerized now so they definitely have the capability and they’ve done it in the past.  They implemented this new policy so that customers can only get store credit. Terrible customer service from manager/ lead Robin.< /review>

The salon staff of great with my dog. She gets very nervous when getting her nails clip and they always take such great care of her. They keep a file of the dogs attitude so they know what to expect. Last few times I took her she had no problems at all. They go out of their way to make sure my dog it's okay during the process</Review>

I love this particular location if Petco. The staff here are super friendly and knowledgeable with all pets. If you're a fish lover, like myself, they have a wide variety of Betas that other pet stores don't carry.< /text>

Very nice store, huge selection, very helpful employees. The parking lot can be difficult to manage mostly because it's old people and "rich" ladies with their little dogs driving big SUV's they don't know how to drive.</review>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>I took my Pom in for a haircut and asked for a teddy bear cut like I always get him. I waited about 4 hours and didn’t receive a call so I went up to petco to see if he was ready. When they brought him out all of his fur was gone! They shaved his face and body! They did an awful job made my sweet dog look like a street rat. Do not get a hair cut by Veronica, she does an awful job and seems completely out of it. Bad experience, very disappointed.< /text>< pics>

<Text>I come often for my pug. About a year ago staff was very friendly and nice to talk too but it seems in the last 6 months or so it seems the staff had a big turn. They are still friendly but don't seem as happy with their jobs. Maybe management changed?  I still come all the time though. :)<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Took my dog Jax for grooming. They were supposed to call when he was ready, but they never called. Furthermore, they took away his flea collar and did not return it so now I have to spend $60+ to get a new one, even though his was only a month old. Horrible service!<//Text>

I ordered the Sichuan chicken which was a tad salty but still with adequate spice. Wife ordered House Chowmein which was with lots of shrimp, Chicken, and beef pieces - although it was quite smoky and salty.<//text>< pictures>

<review>I love sunflower 🌻 they have the best beef / broccoli and egg rolls I have ever had. Of course other dishes are great too but this is my all time favorite, I refuse to eat it anywhere else. Although the prices have changed ($$$) and has recently been sold to new owner. He was a customer himself and he seems to be doing a pretty good job... Added his own touches along with music and TV... And I like it! It works for me. I don't live in the area so whenever I'm in town, I always make it a point to stop and eat or pick something up... Only down fall is parking is not great.. Small price to pay for great food!!!< /review>< rate>

I’ve been meaning to try this place for a while and I’m glad I did. I’ve been driving to San Leandro for my Chinese. This place is closer and better! Great service. When I got there, it turned out the restaurant was closed early due to a catering order but the gentleman who served me, squeezed my order in anyway. He even offered me soup while I waited because it was cold out. So kind. I got the vegetable chow mein. Anytime I try a new restaurant I generally try something super simple. If I’m not let down, I’ll be back and start exploring the menu. I will be back. They use a low mein for the chow mein noodle which I’m not usually a big fan of but it totally didn’t matter. It was still the tastiest chow mein I think I’ve ever had and the noodles were cooked perfectly.  They have the flavors just right. Can’t wait to try the rest of the menu.< /text>

Halal Chinese food.  Those are words I never thought I would run into, but this place does serve up some consistently tasty food.  The only drawback (for me) is the absence of pork on the menu, but the flavor of the beef and other options make this place worth returning.  Plus, call ahead lunch orders make this a good option for a workday lunch.<//text>

We go to the Sunflower 2 every time we get near Hayward or can detour to grab a bite!! The broccoli beef is sublimely delicious! Their shrimp fried rice and sweet and sour soup are so tasty. The staff are friendly and customer centric.

My only concern is the parking! Almost have to walk a block or two! Don’t let that deter you from going!!!</Text>

<text>My favorite Chinese restaurant ever! The Princess Chicken is to die for and the chow mein is almost smokey and not greasy at all. The manager is super nice and they have take out order ready to go in 15-20 minutes. I would highly recommend.< /text>< pics>

A warm and cozy spot with staff that match it perfectly. I’ve now had two bad days salvaged by a simple meal at the Sunflower and I don’t think I’ll ever be leaving without a bit of hot and sour soup to-go to reminisce during my busy days.</Text>

We used to go to the location on the blvd in Castro Valley before it closed and loved it. So, we thought let's give it a try. It was decent but just not as good. The chow mein fell short and they only serve sweet and sour chicken which is surprising because who doesn't love sweet and sour pork.
Parking was limited and we ended up parking at the Wells Fargo bank across the street.
I would still go back but it's not my favorite choice for Chinese food.<//text>

<text>This restaurant has changed a lot in the last year or so. However, I think the changes were a good thing. The restaurant looks great and the menu is fun and easy to read. The food is still excellent and the prices are fair. The staff is knowledgeable about the food and the restaurant, they are also friendly and attentive! I highly recommend this place.</text><pics>None< /pics>< Gmap_id>

Some of the BEST Chinese food that I have eaten in a VERY long time! Atmosphere..Check! Quality of food...Double Check! Basically I will eat at Sunflower 2 every single time I have a "hankering" for Chinese! The sauces and the Princess sauce is by far the BEST sauce list around!!! The chef is a genius!!!!!<//review>

I usually never write reviews but this restaurant deserves it. The food was really great. Very nice restaurant aesthetics. The owner was our server—highly attentive and engaging, really nice guy. Honestly I would eat here again if the service was bad but everything else was a major bonus. I wish I had more reasons to be in this area because I’d for sure come back very regularly!<//Review>

<text>We ordered thru Grubhub to make it easy on us for lunch today and unfortuantely the order got slightly mixed up. I called the restaurant to see if they could do anything to help us out and immediately they took it upon themselves to make it up to us. They don't deliver, but management had someone personally deliver our correct order to make up for the mix up. We all thought that was so kind of them to go out of their way like that. They also didn't want any compensation for it.</text>< Pictures>

Delicious food.  Our favorite Chinese place in the East Bay.  Selection is smaller than most restaurants, but everything on the menu tastes great.  We've been there at least 20 times and the food is always high quality with really fresh vegetables.  The place is small, so call ahead if you're planning on bringing a large group.  Highly recommend trying this place.</text>

Today was my third time eating at Sunflower 2.  I'll definitely be back.

The food is SOOOO good.  The sweet and sour pork is great, the spring rolls are fantastic and the string bean chicken (not on the menu - secret special order) is great!

Great prices, very good service, lots of street parking.

They just changed the look of the place a little bit so it is much more inviting, clean and interesting with some new art (I believe).<//review>

Overall: good prices, great food, chill atmosphere
I really like this place. The menu is simple and the food was pretty amazing. You can tell the food is good quality and fresh and they give you good proportions (I ordered the szechuan chicken btw). Honestly the atmosphere was amazing. I went around 2pm and it was so quiet. There were only 2 other tables occupied. The server (Who i have a feeling is the new owner) was a funny guy. Hes very friendly. Im not sure how busy it gets during dinner or the lunch rush. I’ll have to come back to check it out.</Text>

The American standards. Light on the sauces. Feels like someone's attempt at healthy cooking. The prices are OK but you can find better Chinese for similar prices.</text>

ap to Spanish

Stay away from this agency please. This agency practically stole my $ 298 that I paid for. I stayed with them only two weeks and two days when I had an accident (it was not my fault) at the time of the accident I tried to call them on the phone "24 hours service "and nobody answered me I left messages via web and everything possible to communicate with them. The following days I also called them for almost three weeks until they answered me and supposedly Mr. Scott Smith had my case, the following week I called and a very evil lady called Angelica answered me and told me that my case had been closed. The next day I went to the torrance office and explained that the insurance left me alone and I fixed my problems by myself and My expenses at the  day of the accident. They gave me the same number where they didn't want to return my money .
I wish I could give them 0.
Just I need my money back .
Please ,please ? Be aware of this insurance they won't help you when they must to do .
The worst insurance company ever and they aren't cheap 😒 go to AAA or other one instead freeway.
I'm a real ex customer .</Text>

I just got done receiving insurance at the Torrance branch. Karina De Leon was a big help and also made me feel welcome. As soon as I walked in I was asked if I wanted anything coffee, water. The process took little to no time. It was so easy talk to her and find common ground. I was very happy with the overall service I received. I would recommend anyone who is looking to get any type of insurance to head to Freeway Insurance and ask for Karina De Leon.</Text>

So happy we came here. Karina provided excellent customer service. She was friendly, professional, very informative & listened to all of our needs. She really made the process smooth and easy going. Also, she went out of her way to help me make a payment to have my registration reinstated since I was having trouble doing it on my phone. She truly is a good asset to this company. I will definitely recommend this place. Thank you karina for your time.< /Text>

The Freeway insurance office located on W Knox is outstanding! The brokers are extremely helpful and they will make sure their customers have the best policy possible. I personally wouldn't want any other insurance. I plan to refer all of my friends to Freeway. After this experience, I feel like everyone can find affordable insurance through Freeway. Special thanks to Rhys, he worked hard to get me the best policy there was. Great job Freeway!< /Review>

I bought insurance with them and now they told me I need a different plan. I dropped over  $700 to start an 11 month plan. Now about 15 days later they are telling me that I need to fo into the office get a new price and pay a"changing fee." I haven't even had them for a month. The only reason the rating is so high is because Mike literally had me rate him while still in the office in promise for a "better deal" I will never come here again unless they return my $700 deposit for less then a month of insurance.< /text>

I called in for a quote, they took my information and gave me a price based on my driving history. Went in to pay and when i got there they took my information down again and they gave me a completely different price. Close to 100 dollars more than what i was quoted for over the phone. When asked why.. she said we have different prices over the phone.  Bad customer service!</review>

I have shopped around for  cheaper rates just to see and I always end up with a newfound appreciation for how low my monthly rates actually are.

Mike at freeway insurance saved me $700/year! I would recomend freeway because seriously, they will take the time to find the most affordable policy for you. No joke, after drving for the past 12 years, and paying too much for basic coverage, I just found the cheapest policy I've ever had to pay finally.<//Text>

Coming in here was such a big sigh of relief! I was given a certain rate over the phone and was content. But come bill time I found out stone wood changed my rate without telling me. So I came into the office and was helped out by Karina De Leon and she helped me above and beyond get what I needed done! She got me the good rate with honesty. Thanks yall!< /review>

<review>This was by far the easiest experience I've ever had I'm a brand-new driver only had my license for a couple of months I expected to spend out rages amounts of dollars on insurance and this was the cheapest quote out of all the companies that I've called. I spent less than 20 minutes over the phone and Juan Canizales talk to me through every single step and said that I would only have to deal with him in any future events easiest transaction ever and I'm thoroughly satisfied.<//review>< GmapID>

<Name>Grace Valentine<//Name><Rating>1<//Rating><review>Not happy with service,  was given quote went to Carson location and nobody there it was 10:30am went to other location on Knox and was helped , thought I was getting a good deal until they went over contract and the deductible was 1000 but I asked for 500 then they changed it and gave higher price.  But when they gave me first price said it was with 500 deductible.  And then told me I'm due every 14th and about a week ago I get letter im past due it was only 2 or 3 weeks after I signed up. I would not recommend this place , they give mixed up info and cant accommodate you for there screw up. I am not satisfied with them. I dont plan to continue with them!. Dont come here!!<//review>< Pictures>

The staff was awesome and kind -- the food was great, and I found that we derived a lot of value for what we paid. I plan to come back here every few months during COVID as a nice getaway from home.

Great staff, good food and clean.  The one thing I will improve will be the window coverings.  The light in the morning is not 100% blocked so you will wake up early even if you don't want to!< /Text>

This hotel is adorable! We stayed here for our anniversary. Although built recently, the hotel is decorated with antiques and authentic pieces that the owner has collected over the years. We received wine and a cheese plate upon arrival, and loved enjoying breakfast outdoors with made-to-order hot food! Although expensive, would definitely recommend. :)<//text>

The staff was so kind at check-in and even wrote me a hand written note welcoming me back since my last stay. The hotel staff provides you with 2 complimentary glasses of wine and a lovely cheese plate. The rooms are adorably decorated and so is the lobby! I’d recommend Hotel Enchantè to anyone.<//review>

Originally had a reservation for at a hotel in Palo Alto where I had stayed before.  It had substantially deteriorated in the 7 intervening years since I was there.  I was not going to spend the second night at that place.  Found the Enchante Hotel on line and booked it on Expedia.  Really nice hotel.  A little more expensive than the first hotel I was at, but it was not out of range for Silicon Valley hotels.  Attractive, newer property.  I understand the owner lives on site and her pride in the hotel shows through.  The complimentary charcuterie and cheese plate and wine during the afternoon was quite nice, as was the selection of breakfast items.  Only a couple of minor negatives: be careful on the bathroom floors.  Marble floors are attractive but slick when wet!  Also, watch your shins, because the metal bed frames are unforgiving.  But I would definitely stay there again.  I hope I have the opportunity to do so.< /review>

Charming little hotel with rather tight rooms and appropriate period decor. Seemed a little odd given how spacious some of the restrooms are...

Even the bar/restaurant is small. But the location, if you're visiting or attending an event in downtown Los Altos, is impossible to beat.<//review>

Cooked-for-you breakfast is excellent-- high end restaurant quality. And top notch service. The staff remember your name, seem to genuinely welcome you back.<//Text>< user>

Stayed 6 nights here. Staff is really friendly, and the complementary breakfast is made to order and undoubtedly the best complementary breakfast experiences I've experienced to date. Note that you will be doing street parking, which has a 2 to 3 hour limit during the hours of 8/9am - 6pm, but the hotel will provide all-day passes if requested. Overall a great stay!</Review>

Was here at the hotel for the day preparing for a wedding as a bridesmaid. The rooms are beautifully decorated with large comfortable furniture and is very picturesque. The building itself is very cute and the staff seemed helpful as well. Not sure what it's like as an overnight guest but it looked like a really cute place to stay if you're in the area!</text>

Nice enough little boutique hotel, but very variable in room size-- mostly almost-too-small given the price. Even the hotel bar is, well, a bit tiny-- but it works!</review>

Enchante is my new go-to romantic getaway hotel!  I've stayed there twice now, and I have to say that their fantastic staff is matched by a truly charming and comfortable facility.  We are welcomed with a smile any time of day or night (along with our pets, whom they have considered as well).  Each room at Enchante is themed: Apothique, Marie Antoinette, and Amerique are a few.  Guests are treated to a complimentary charcuterie plate in the evening, and a breakfast each morning.  When I made a booking error, the staff bent over backwards to accommodate me for an additional night... for which I will be eternally grateful!

Whether you're in town for business or just a vacation in the South Bay/South Peninsula, Enchante is a worthy choice.  Downtown Los Altos is just steps away, with so many choices for food and entertainment that you would never need to stray far.  Cupertino is home to one of the largest Taiwanese communities outside Taiwan so it's an excellent base camp if you're looking for a weekend of comfort food.

Parking can be tricky on busy weekends, and the occasional Street Festival blocks off the road - so be sure to check with the hotel before parking your car for the night.</Text>

We had the opportunity to stay after my husband's Military Change of Command Ceremony from Fort Hunter Liggett.

Above & Beyond in friendly, professional  service, thoughtful amenities coupled with stylish parisian accommodations.

Our trip was both delightful and a memorable experience in the Françoise Grand Suite.

Top Notch Service by Josh S. General Manager & Abby A. Enchante Boutique Hotel Owner.

Merci etc a bientot!

The restaurant, Campagne One Main, serves small plates and offers a limited menu of wines, beers, and non-alcoholic beverages. The outdoor patio is lovely, but it's proximity to two busy streets makes it loud and frankly, dangerous. The ownership comes off as elitist- beware service may be poor if you are not a local or established community member.< /review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x808fb0eef2c5b1e1:0x8d8c9e31ca041a4<//Gmap_id></record>

After reading the reviews we we're a little Leary but the few bad reviews are not deserved. The place is clean, friendly service. The food was good and while it has a nice Western theme there are not a bunch of John Wayne pictures on the walls. Although personally I wouldn't mind if there were. I wish there were more items at the salad bar but it was still a good salad. Wednesday is all U can eat beef ribs and they are not stingy with them<//Text>

Totally enjoyed our top sirloin steaks at the Brand N Iron restaurant tonight.  Chef Phillip Ferguson cooked them to perfection!  The flavor was amazing!  The service was great, too.  Our waitress was very sweet.  We will definitely be back for more.< /text>

If you're looking for something interesting -- move on.  Fifteen item salad bar, limited menu, one dessert option, a scoop of vanilla ice cream with Hershey's syrup (really!).  On the other hand, the food is simple and edible.  Be prepared for dingy surroundings with pictures of John Wayne.<//text>

<Review>Good food and you get lots of it. Dessert and salad are included in the price of your food. It's a small little scoop of icecream but after all the food that's all you need.<//Review>< gmapID>

<Text>I stopped by since I was staying in the econolodge next door and it's walking distance.  It's definitely the small town "everybody knows everybody" place.  Tube tv's on the walls, no beer on tap but the service was friendly and I had a good time.  I could find faults with the place but it does the job.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x54ce45da6fab0079:0x5d07899865199d5d</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Customers are an inconvenience apparently :/  From the moment we walked through the door and were asked if we had reservations??? There were 11 of us but the place was empty.
We were placed at 2 tables and the waitress was irritated we had 2 families there who were on separate checks.... not hard to take one family's order and then the next......$10 for a kids plate is kind of ridiculous also.  Food was mediocre.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< rate>

The Remington Club took my father into their care as he entered hospice and were a wonderful source of care during a difficult time for our family. They were very accommodating of our visits and became friends over the time he was in their care. Nancy, Dr. Singh, Denny, Michelle and Fran in particular were especially kind and helpful. Dr. Singh reminded us of what a good, caring doctor can be; we were all impressed and comforted by his heart and mind. Nancy kindly welcomed us on our visits, sometimes telling us personal stories about her journey during her parents’ final days. In addition to their excellent care, they showed comforting kindness and grace.<//review>

<Name>Chris Cooper</Name><Review>I recently attended the 30th Anniversary event at the Remington Club Healthcare Center as a vendor (photographer).    The event was well organized and prepared, with lots of people attending.   Everyone from residents, to visitors, to the staff were all smiling and having a good time.  And how could you not have a good time, there was lots of food, music,  entertainment, games, and even recognition awards from the facility director to the residents.   Staff was kept busy answering questions, meeting and greeting folks and just making themselves available to anyone who had a question or needed anything.   Even the wait staff were always checking on me to see if there was anything I needed...and they were very busy moving about as quickly as humanly possible ensuring everyone was taken care of.   My hat is off to all involved in putting this extravaganza together.

I also had the opportunity to visit with the administrative staff and received brief tour of the facility by the lovely and friendly Admissions Coordinator, Pamela Cooper or just "Cooper" as I am told.   I also took the time to speak with some of the residents at the event and there was not a single unhappy face or negative comment from them.   From what I can gather this is a top notch facility and years down the road, should the need arise, this is where I would be happy to hang my hat and call home as many others have done.   It is a warm and friendly facility with an amazing staff who genuinely care about you.<//Review></record>

The Remington Club has been an amazing home for 2 generations of our family. My Grandmother lived there the last years of her life in Independent & Assisted Living. When choosing an independent living community for my father we knew it could only be Remington. Not only are the grounds and living areas well maintained & manicured, the food is delicious and there are MANY activities to choose from every day. The Staff is so involved and attentive to not only the residents, but to their loved ones as well. The constant updates that have been circulated during the Pandemic to residents & family helped to maintain an unprecedented level of safety & health during this difficult year. I would choose Remington again & again for a senior living community for anyone I love.</text>

< review>
During this past unusual year the Remington Club staff has done a wonderful job of keeping us healthy in mind and body.   The administration was very efficient in getting the residents and staff vaccinated early.   I feel fortunate that we were able to receive both doses of the vaccine so early and in such an orderly way.  We continue to follow the CDC guidelines to  keep us safe.<//review>

I really had a wonderful experience going around this facility. The ambiance is perfect and they really did a very good job on how residents will feel comfortable. There’s a mini theatre and the dining area really looks fancy. All the residents I encounter greets me all the time and it shows how they are really comfortable with the place. Definitely a good place to start!<//Review>

<text>When we first settled my grandmother in, staff were really lovely. Unfortunately, today seems to be different. I live in England as a PhD student. I've been trying to get a hold of my grandmother in hospice care just to let her know I've submitted my PhD thesis - something she has been a major inspiration on. It would be a two minute conversation, given my grandmother's condition. I arranged with the lady at the front desk yesterday to call back today at 9:30 just to let my grandmother know I've finished thesis. Diane is on the front desk today and has decided that's no longer possible and is jostling me around from one expensive phone call to another, interrupting me when I try to explain the situation. It's incredibly difficult being away from my grandmother for this long and at this time - both with covid and because she is dying. The last thing anyone needs at a time like this is to be treated as if they are a nuisance for trying to get a hold of a family member.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

My father had an urgent move from Michigan to California. Jane Navas was able to graciously and professionally accommodate this move in less than one week. She was extremely helpful and caring.

Never been in a skilled nursing facility as a patient. I arrived after hours. The person at the front desk welcome to me new my name knew where I was going to go and that started the beginning of a wonderful time at the Remington. Got into my room and the first thing they asked has had I had dinner yet. The answer was no their kitchen was closed but they had already saved a dinner for me.

There are many departments and the employees of each are fantastic. Doctors, nurses, nurses assistants, physical therapists, occupational therapists, housekeeping, administration. Every person in every department was kind, patient, enthusiastic but understanding.

The food  is great. I had to consciously stop eating all the food they serve me.

The care and actual rehabilitation is fantastic.

If you have the option of the Remington, take it.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<text>I moved in the last day of August 2019 and am settled in comfortably. I feel I have been welcomed by residents and staff alike A wide variety of activities are available and .I have been able to participate in the exercise program and found it to be helpful . Questions have usually been answered promptly  by the concierge or other staff as well as the residents. I feel part of the community.
I have had some computer problems and Diana has come to offer assistance in a  professional manner.  I did know two people prior to moving here but have found it easy to make new friends and acquaintances.
All in all, I am glad to be here and participate as I am able.

We were nervous because she had an awful experience at a previous rehabilitation place 2 years ago. However, her visit at The Remington Club has been absolutely amazing. All staff from Admin, to clerical, maintenance crew and Nursing were all above par. Everyone was very attentive, kind and helpful. When my mom had a bad day due to her being sick Dante, her nurse and the CNA never left her side. Mom calls them her Angles. In addition to the staff, the food was excellent and the facility was very clean. Mom was only here 5 days even though it was originally a week.

I am a caregiver for a 92 year old and he has been in many of the local rehabilitation facilities and 2 years ago was his first time at The Remington Club and this facility is by far the best.  In terms of care, cleanliness and staff they are outstanding.  Their rehab staff is caring and very knowledgeable and get the patient back up and moving and doing things quickly and safely so they can get back to living a normal life again back in their home where they are in their normal surroundings.  If you want the best care for your family member that needs this type of care you won't find a better place.

<review>I think highly of the Remington Club which has been the home for my 87 year old parents.  My parents enjoy living here and have many choices in activities, services, outings and dining. The amenities are always very clean and up to date.  Their living quarters are spacious and complete including a full kitchen, washer and dryer and large bedrooms and closets.  I appreciate the great service provided by all the staff members and we have only but compliments for each of them.   The quality and selection of the meals provided are great - much better than other residences my parents have lived in (On some occasions, however, the food service promptness leaves some room for improvement as does the selection of wines offered).   We are grateful that we discovered The Remington Club and are confident that my parents are in good hands there.< /review><Rating>5< /Rating>< Resp>

Their dining hall is horrible.. no healthy dinner meals.. no option for those with diabetes.. food is high in sodium.
Dining staff is very insensitive to the residents. They hire young kids who can care less about their job and the impact they make on elders...horrible staff and cooks are very rude<//Review>

<Review>10 Stars for the 5 Star Remington!!! Starting at the front desk, Michelle & Nancy are friendly, full of valuable information, and always there with a smile & helping hand. Jaylan was our admissions hero and got everything in place for us at record speed. The nursing staff were all so helpful & attentive, and Dr. Singh is very approachable and treats patients and family members very well. I would highly recommend Remington Care to anyone.</Review>< pics>

<review>I love looking out the windows and see the beautiful trees and the pool looks so inviting.  The rose gardens are so pretty in bloom.  Its great that there is parking in a secure location for the residents.  A lot of  fun and exciting trips are planned throughout the month.  All the residents are so pleasant and willing to help the new one get acquainted  with the areas and meeting others.  Employees are helpful too.</review>< name>

<date>1572291717952<//date><Rate>5<//Rate><text>I had a spinal fusion at Scripts Hospital in Encinitas.I was a little wobbly at discharge time so they suggested rehab for a week or two. I was a little apprehensive about it after hearing horror stories of some places. I took 7 days of rehab and arrived in a wheelchair and left under my own power. This place was nothing like that. Choose your mals in advance from a wide variety of food and it's very good food as well. The staff is great all positive, not a bad apple in the bunch. The therapy sessions are great and they take great care in the right exercises for each individual. I'm glad I took this week after my hospital stay. The therapy staff taught me some great tricks for recovery. I'm more than happy to give them 5 stars.</text>< pics>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>I’ve been a frequent visitor to Remington Club for several years. I’ve had friends and family members stay here. Currently my Great Aunt, retired US Airforce, is staying at the skilled nursing facility and soon moving to the assisted living facility.

In the past two weeks I’ve been here several times per week.

Everyone here is helpful. Your visit starts with a lovely lady beaming with a delightful mood settling smile. Her name is Nancy Bragg and I will be coming to say hello to her after my aunt is moved to the assisted living facility next door.

As you walk past Nancy’s station you notice how clean and comfortable everything is. There are many people working here and they’re all very helpful and attentive.

The bedside care here is extraordinary, the food is great and they can easily customize the care to anyone’s needs.

Thanks Nancy, Nathan, Sophany and Iris for a great experience.<//Text>< pictures>

The staff at the Remington Club are professional, willing to assist, and friendly. Their skilled nursing unit is one of the best. I am assured that my clients are in the best environment from the lobby, to the client’s room, and supported with expert care from the clinical staff, physical therapy, and dietary. Nancy, from the business office, provides an easy transfer for my clients who are discharged from the hospital to the Remington with one phone call. It is a pleasure to work with such a great team. I highly recommend their services.< /Review>

My son is a senior in high school and he sees a lot of his friends in the dining area which seems like a great opportunity for kids in high school.  I call it the cruise ship experience in that there's tons of activities, the rooms are nice and the food is excellent.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Time>

I have lived at the Remington Club for 2 1/2 years.  I have been exceptionally well treated by everyone here, from the senior staff to the wait staff.  It seems to me that one of the main purposes of the club is to make people welcome, address all concerns in a timely manner and provide the comforts of home. All of above are true.  I fine this very true for concierge, Diana, who always goes out of her way to be helpful to the residents.  I particularly like it when she visits with us at the dinner hour before she goes home for the evening.  I was telling someone just this morning that if have no or very few complaints about this Five Star Facility.</text>

After having gotten up to go pee, at 4:30 in the morning I sustained a fall.  As a result of this fall, I broke the largest bone in my body - the upper leg bone (femur). To fix it, they inserted a rod in the middle of the bone from my hip down to my knee. Then they put a nail through the rod and up in my pelvis. Not fun. After I was discharged from the hospital, I still needed skilled nursing care as well as Physical therapy and Occupational therapy.  I was so delighted to find the Remington Club. The staff was professional, gentle, and very kind. They knew what they were doing as they frequently see patients with the same condition as mine. In short order (2 days), they had managed my pain and had me up and walking with the help of the staff and a walker. While it took some time to get me independent, the folk at Remington Club were wonderful and accomplished a lot with this old man.

Dr. Singh was assigned to my case. He is one of the best doctor I have known, and I have seen a lot. He was very knowledgeable, kind and very approachable. He observed my pain level and prescribed the appropriate medication and dosage. There was no nonsense about the pain meds; something unheard of in today’s medicine!  He was truly wonderful.

Going to Physical / Occupational Therapy was like going to a party. Every member of the therapy staff was wonderful. They knew exactly what exercises would work for me and gently guided me through all the steps. Every person had a plethora of tricks around specific actions like climbing stairs, getting in and out of a car, dressing myself, etc.  Very helpful.

I can’t say enough about how good my experience at Remington Club was despite my injury.  These people are outstanding in all aspects of a post operative rehabilitation facility!</text>

<Text>I would like to write a great view for the Remington Club.  My name is Todd and My wife has worked as a fitness therapist for many, many, years at the Remington Club.  She mentions how much she loves the residents, the management and the overall work place. She works in many settings and the location she most enjoys is the Remington Club. She is happy that they treat their employees and contractors with the utmost respect. She has let go of some work to solely give more time to the residents at Remington. When a location is properly managed it's a win win for everyone including husbands having a happy wife like me!</Text></record></dataset><record>

I have been with Remington for close to 18 years teaching a variety of classes (Chair Fitness, Balance and Yoga) and in the fitness industry for over 40 years. I SO enjoy working with the seniors at Remington. They give me motivation! The Remington is an exceptionally clean, happy and enjoyable environment. The residents that I work with tell me about their field trips, activities, special events, etc. I have been in several resident's homes as a personal trainer and they are very, very nice. The services provided are outstanding.
My mother-in-law (99 yrs.) would live here if she was closer! We have been to several events, such as the holiday entertainment.< /review>

<Review>I recommend The Remington Club to anyone seeking a quality, full-service senior living facility.  The personnel at the Remington Club were instrumental in making the transition for my parents manageable and without stress.  The Skilled Nursing Facility and Staff aided my father in recovering from a stroke and moving into an Independent Living apartment with my mom.  The Remington II is a beautiful complex, with excellent dining, activities, and an outdoor area that is peaceful and comfortable.   The location of the Remington Club makes it easy for residents to walk, shuttle, or drive to familiar businesses.</Review>< pictures>

It is obvious that they develop strong bonds with the people in their care and go the extra mile to ensure their wellbeing and satisfaction.  The staff is also very knowledgeable.

My apartment is well designed with plenty of space in living room and bed room.  I control my own heating and cooling.  With the door open to the balcony it brings in the out of doors.  The people are so friendly and helpful to each other. There is always something on the Menu that appeals to me.  The servers are wonderful young students who learn from us and we from them...keeps us young.  If I have a problem there is always someone  to whom I can go to for help.<//review>

<Review>We decided to place our mom at The Remington Club Health Center for Rehab based on initial conversations with Nancy and Michelle at the HealthCare Center reception desk. Three weeks later and we are very pleased with the rehab care so far. The convenient location, the staff’s energy level, quality and variety of meals, entertainment opportunities,  and overall attention our mom receives affirms that The Remington was the right choice for us. The smiles and greetings our family receives when we visit (which is on a daily basis) is very nice. We appreciate the entire staff at the Health Center. The nurses, the volunteer musicians, Sadie the social worker, and the Occupational and Physical therapists are providing amazing care, which makes a very difficult time easier for us all.<//Review>< pics>

What an incredible community to live in!  I have many great memories of coming to The Remington Club as a kid to volunteer with my elementary school class.  My grandfather moved here when his health began to decline a couple of years ago.  One of the many things I like about The Remington Club is their multi-level care approach.

This allows someone to move into their independent living community and as the level of care required increases, they can accommodate higher levels of care at their assisted-living community.

Additionally, they have a great staff with very low turnover in comparison to the rest of the industry. If you are considering an assisted/independent living community, I highly recommend taking a tour of this one before making a final decision!</Review>

A wonderful friend of ours lived at the Remington Club and loved his stay.  He would proudly show us his room and the surroundings and was friends with many of the other residents.  The staff was always friendly, attentive and helpful.  Our friend is no longer with us (he lived to age 96!!) but we remain grateful for the care and wonderful attention paid to him.  We highly recommend the Remington Club!!< /Text>

<review>I can't say enough good things about Remington Health Care Center. It's never easy when a loved one has a serious medical situation that requires skilled nursing. However, the staff at Remington Health Care Center made me feel much better knowing that my mother was there. All of them are kind, caring and patient. My mother received excellent care and the staff was very considerate when helping my sister and I through this process. Once again, I want to thank the staff for all their help and kindness. I highly recommend them.< /review>< user_id>

Fabulous skilled nursing facility.  My mom has stayed here on 3 separate occasions this past year.  All the staff is so caring, compassionate, and friendly.  They take great care of her.  She loves the food, her room, the grounds are beautiful, but most of all the people make her feel special.< /review>

We are happy we picked the Remington Club as our retirement home. The apartments are large and bright and have private outdoor space which was important to us. Resident services are reliable and provided by friendly staff. Many of the staff have worked for Remington for years and moved up thru the ranks this speaks well of management. Fellow residents are friendly and interesting. You can be as busy or lazy as you wish. We are happy to live here<//Review>

He was a retired dentist and absolutely loved his freedom.  He did not want to move from his home in Oceanside, but his health prevented him from living alone.  My parents talked with him and persuaded him to move to Remington.  Although he was hesitant, he moved and within several weeks of living at Remington, he felt right at home.  He made friends quickly and was able to continue his daily exercise routine (very important to him).  He complimented the staff and felt very comfortable in his new surroundings.

As a local pastor, I got to lots of facilities, visiting our various members and I have to say, The Remington Club Health Center is where I would want to stay if I needed to recover. The staff is friendly and helpful. Nancy Bragg, at the reception desk, always recognized me, greeted me warmly and is the best at helping me find my way to my people. She is a gem and represents the best of the values of the Remington Club.</text>

I was so impressed with the sense of community that existed between the residents; and even more importantly between the staff and the residents.  At one point the group I was in, invited me to lunch.  The service and food were both excellent.  From the minute I was cheerfully greeted by the concierge in the lobby, to each interaction I had with staff, I was convinced that this facility would be the one I would choose when that time arrives in my life.<//review>< Pics>

My experience at Remington 1 has been very positive.  I have been here 18 months and during that time I have met numerous friendly people, participated in a number of fun activities and generally enjoyed myself.  Most of the staff, especially those working at Trellisis, have been very helpful. I especially enjoyed the Scenic Drives.< /review>

<Text>I have been working with the staff in the Health Care Center for almost 8 years now, as well as the families that we help who are in the Health Care Center for rehabilitation. The staff has always been friendly, and families have been happy with the care and services that they receive, so much so that they often want to stay longer! I have always had wonderful feedback from families whose loved ones are being cared for here, and haven't heard anything bad about the care and services, which is different from many other Health Care Centers that we work with. That makes this place stand out above the rest in my book!</Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

In September I broke my hip and my three adult children  made the search to find Mom the next best thing to living at home.  After touring about every available place in  the area,  all 3 decided on the Remington.
The dining room  is open  for breakfast, lunch and dinner all day and has a wonderful varied menu which changes weekly.  There are day trips for those who choose to do outside activities and numerous in house activities as well. For anyone needing therapy there is a very experienced staff.  Everyone tries to make you welcome and feel at home.  I want to especially thank Diana for her thoughtful, caring attitude.

I volunteered at the Remington Club for a couple years. During my time there, I help with numerous activities lead by Jan Cannarella, the Activities Director. What an asset to the company! The seniors were very happy, challenged, and entertained by the planned activities. The Remington Club was a social, safe, and welcoming senior community and all of the staff were enjoyable to work with.<//text>

<text>My husband and I own a store in Rancho Bernardo and think very highly of the Remington club on so many levels.  Their office staff is always courteous and knowledgeable and truly care about their residents
As notaries, we visit many assisted living facilities and the Remington shines, from their ultra clean facility to the general culture of the organization.Their residents are engaged and happy. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this facility to friends or family, and would consider it for our future retirement needs.</text>< Pics>

<rating>5</rating><review>As a Realtor I have wonderful relationships with many families and when the time comes for placing their senior family members in "the perfect" facility The Remington is the first place I suggest for many reasons: The Remington is a joyous, stylish yet comfortable home.

Everyone there is experienced with seniors needs and preferences and the residents are catered to while being encouraged to enjoy their independence.  With so very many stimulating, educational, healthy and fun activities to choose from on a daily basis how could anyone be bored or feel unfulfilled?

The staff are all stars but the one who shines brightest in my eyes is Jane Navas.  Going the extra mile comes naturally to her.  After assisting the new resident in locating the best unit for them personally she  always  checks in on their needs and wishes and moves mountains to see an even larger smile on their faces.<//review>< Pictures>

During a tour of the building, i quickly noticed the beauty and cleanliness of this community. The staff was friendly and caring and you instantly knew the passion they felt for their residents. The Executive Director, Kristen, was an excellent tour guide and you could feel the passion she has for her residents and building. Thank you Remington Club for making my tour a wonderful experience.<//Text>

<text>In the past couple years my mom has had three different rehab visits to the healthcare center.  She is currently in her third stay and recovering nicely from a recent congestive heart event.  She currently has little motivation on her own but the rehab staff is very good at getting her cooperation (especially Mari).  The nurses and CNAs are very friendly and always assessable.  My mom loves the facility doctor who sees her frequently.  He is definitely the main reason she returns each stay.  She also thinks the food is very good and likes being able to choose from a daily selection.  After experiencing other SNFs with my mother in law, I can honestly say this facility beats them all.<//text><gmapID>0x80dbf0d1bc607af9:0xcfc24ed4e6c28a7b< /gmapID><userid>100105151728500128158< /userid>< resp>

The staff here at the Remington club goes above and beyond expectations. The Remington club is the cleanest independent senior living communities I have ever been in. The residents here love their resort style living and amenities that they provide. I would highly recommend the Remington club for anyone that's looking for a senior independent or assisted living Community. Five star all the way< /Review>

The Remington Club has been more than what we have expected over the past 5 years.   We have now been here almost 7 years and this past, our 5th year, has been taken up entirely with Covid-19.  That has, indeed, been a most eventful year. It would take up a couple pages to tell you what everyone did to make us comfortable and happy. From the top position, right down to the lowest position on the scale, they pulled together in an extremely positive way.  The ups and downs they had, as well as us, appear to be behind all of us and we can once again look forward to a bright future here at  The Remington Club.
There is a very broad menu daily, and the chefs sure know how to cook fine dishes. There skills are Class A.  Entertainment keeps us happy, and the staff, always available, attend to all our needs.
In conclusion, allow me to help you decide to move here as soon as you can.  We are a very friendly bunch of people....< /text>

My mother was in independent living 25 years ago.  I never dreamed I would choose the same place for myself!  The residents and staff are SO friendly and welcoming.  I had investigated many other communities, but I immediately felt at home here.< /Review>

This month marks the 6th anniversary of our (PS Salon and Spa) partnership with The Remington Club.  Kristen Kearnaghan and the rest of the team at The Remington Club have been wonderful to work with, and the culture of respect and support they have cultivated is apparent throughout the community.  The residents we serve in each of the community's salons are as inspiring to our professionals as they are gracious!  This is a 'Five Star' community in every way!</Text>

Not only does the front office staff treat other healthcare professionals with respect and dignity, the care that they provide for their patients is top notch! We once had a client of ours  that was rehabbing there tell us that she wasn't in a rush to get back home to our care because the food, staff and care at The Remington Health Center was EXCELLENT.  I've heard that only twice in my 9 years of being in healthcare. If you need rehab, I highly recommend The Remington Club!<//Review><user>107319582991114187429<//user><Gmap_id>0x80dbf0d1bc607af9:0xcfc24ed4e6c28a7b< /Gmap_id>< response>

There are so many great things I can share about The Remington Club. From the excellent location to the friendly staff, this is definitely a top notch facility.    If you are looking for a senior living center in San Diego with amazing service and lots of amenities, I highly recommend visiting The Remington Club.< /Review>

Remington should not be considered.  They do not have enough staff to service all the residents.  They make promises to you and then change their minds and will not accept you.  This facility caters to the rich and stuffy.  Not  a friendly atmosphere.  They discriminate residentsl with disabilities and are incapable of trying to come up with solutions.   They nickel and dime you especially when they assess you and pad the services you don't need.  If you have a pet they want you to use their pet services so they can charge you more.  They charge $1000 as a pet deposit.  After speaking to sales rep she told me she wanted me to be part of the community and even told me the number of my new apartment.  Read what they offer and don't be surprised that they won't commit to services they offer.  Not very honest nor trustworthy.<//review>

{'time': 1515726028408, 'text': "Chris, I am the Executive Director and want to thank you taking the time to explore our community. There are many factors that must be considered when determining if The Remington Club has the necessary services to fit a potential resident's needs. As such we carefully assess each person's specific needs prior to move-in as we want residents to call our community their home for years to come. On occasion, an individual will need a higher level of care than we can provide. In that event we do our best to help identify other senior living options that may better fit those needs -- and hopefully one of those options will work out well for you. Please contact me at the community if you have any additional questions."}< /Resp>

The Remington Club is a fantastic community which goes above and beyond for its residents. The grounds and buildings are meticulously maintained and there is clearly a focus on attention to detail. Considering the community is 30 years old it still is warm and inviting, but could benefit from a facelift in certain areas. The leadership and staff hare welcoming and inviting everyone from the executive director Kristen Kearnaghan all the way down to the support staff are all in line with each other and go out of their way to ensure all people are welcomed from families, to vendors, visitors, and the community.< /Text>

I had a family member convalesce at the Remington  Club after a knee replacement surgery and it was a very positive experience for them and our family. The staff was kind, attentive and very helpful with any of our requests and needs. The facility was clean and very well organized. I would absolutely recommend it.< /Review>

I would like to take this time to write a fantastic review for The Remington Club. Hopefully this review can be helpful for those considering living at The Remington Club or for anyone wishing to work in such a wonderful senior living setting.
I've worked in the health and fitness industry for over 30 years and at The Remington Club for 19 years. I service the exercise needs in all the locations: Assisted Living - Independent Living and Health Care.
I'm fortunate as a contractor I can see a bit of management, residents and employees.
I am so proud and blessed to be a part of such a professional and caring senior living.
Kristen Kearnaghan is the Executive Director and she along with Jennifer Bradford the Program Director make this location standout as 5 star! Kristen is always visible, attentive to needs, high expectation and bottom line so warm and compassionate that all employees love to perform as she is so good to everyone! The top does trickle down and we all want to do our best for her! The residents are equally happy as if there is a concern she is right on it! She is a huge factor to the success of The Remington Club! All senior livings require a top notch activities program! I am in awe over the diversity, fun and unique offerings! Jennifer has great creativity and you will find this place has it all! I can't imagine living anywhere else! Fun is a constant!
The grounds are maticious the food I hear is exceptional so add the excellent leader to this along with a great program of activities I give The Remington Club a 5 star!<//Text>

Like the location!! Totally unhappy with dining experience. (You know why!!) Appreciate the activities...Bingo, trips, happy hour music. Like the freedom of decorating my own patio. That feels personalized. Sorry for the low rating, but the dining overshadows the good.</Text>< Pictures>

<review>We are musicians that go there to play  for their residents for their Happy Hour. We've been going there for more than ten years now.
The first impression was,  wow! this place is beautiful.   For the years that we've been coming,  we see happy residents.  When residents are happy and contented,  it means they are getting good care and good service.  Even in the Skilled Nursing side,  we could see how they are cared for.   If you have loved ones that need to live in an Independent Living, Assisted Living  facility or if your loved ones are recovering  from surgery or need rehab,  this is a great place for consider.

My mother in law resides at Remmington Club Assisted Living for over 10 years now.  My husband and I are very impressed with the quality of care she receives.  The care givers keep her engaged, well dressed, and most of all talk to her with kindness and sincere interest.  The best compliment I can give Remmington Club ; I tell my daughters when the time comes for me to receive care, I want to go to the Remmington Club.< /text>

<text>Eleven years at the Remington Club in Rancho Bernardo and I'm still going strong.  I give them a five star rating, largely because of the willing helpfulness of the vàlets, servers, dining room staff, transportation, housekeepers, concierge and maintenance staff.  How we lived before Marshall joined the Remington is beyond me.

Notably, in the concierge staff,  Diana is most helpful in solving computer problems, opening pill bottles, pickle jars and the Trelises' front entrance door.  And like a mother hen, after ending her work day, she visits all the tables in the dining room, checking on the residents.  The Remington Club, and we the residents, are fortunate to have her.< /text><Rating>5</Rating><date>1531436858504<//date><GmapID>0x80dbf0d1bc607af9:0xcfc24ed4e6c28a7b< /GmapID></record>

Kudos to the Remington Club in Rancho Bernardo, California. Management and all team members have worked diligently to make our residence a safe environment during the past year of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Nearly 100% of residents and staff have received the first and second Pfizer vaccines, while sheltering in place. A remarkable percentage!

The disruption of our previous life style has been met with a well planned program in order to meet the needs of everyone involved.  Our appreciation is evident daily, especially when a server brings our evening meal to our door.  One can actually see his/her smile through the facial covering, along with the twinkling eyes.

The review following was written, but not posted, shortly following the celebration of the Remington Club's 30th anniversary and is still "current".

Five Stars to the Remington Club in Rancho Bernardo, California.
Recently I, and about 499 other people, attended the 30th anniversary of the Remington Club.

This event was super special.  Included was a photographer who took pictures of the ladies and gents, a caricaturist who exaggerated the good features of those willing to participate, several couples whose smooth dancing entertained the audience, and there was food aplenty!

The young servers, handsomely dressed in their tuxedos, were scattered among us, offering delicious appetizers throughout various areas of the Campus, indoors and outside by the lovely swimming pool and terrace. area.

At one point in the festivities our Executive Director, Kristen Kearnaghan, welcomed the guests who were assembled in the main lobby and told a bit of the history of the Remington Club in Rancho Bernardo.  She gave special recognition to those residents who have made the Remington Club their home for ten or more years, one having moved here in 1999.  The Management team and all the staff worked tirelessly, making the 30th anniversary an afternoon to remember.  Each guest was given a souvenir glass,  commemorating the occasion, along with a copy of the 30th anniversary edition of Pearls of Wisdom, words to live by, from the residents and staff of the Remington Club. All in all a most enjoyable celebration.</text>

I’m so happy with my decision to move to the Remingon Club. I visited 5 other independent living places then because of the location in Rancho Bernardo behind the Vons shopping center I chose The Remingon Club. I had no idea of the wonderful people who work there and I mean they are so helpful,understanding, compassionate, and totally understand the traumatic lifestyle change your going through. I love my one bedroom apt. It’s very spacious and has everything I need including a built-washer and dryer. The room service is a big plus. Marshal whose in charge of the parking spot you get and drivers to take you to your appointments. The people who run the concierge desk in the lobby and the Trellis are are extremely helpful &caring and do all they can accomplish your needs. There are three words to describe the Remingon Club

My mother is at the Remington Club for rehabilitation from having a new knee.  She arrived on Sunday afternoon and still has not had physical therapy.  The OT specialist saw her twice and the leg raising machine was only used once until it broke. I left messages to check on her physical therapy schedule and my mother also asked for one.  We still don't have one and no one called me back.  We did not place her there to just be fed and have a room.  Very irritating</review>

<user>101345504518855430814</user><Review>First off is my parents backstory, they just came from a mobile home park in Mira Mesa and due to both having various health issues as well as my dad having limited physical abilities due to a severe stroke they never were able to do much. They were couped up in there home. I have to tell you, on the very first day they woke up in their new place at the Remington Club my dad made his way to his motorized wheelchair  (which he previously used less than a handful of times) and he says "well....lets go" and sure enough he made it to the elevator and we all went downstairs and had breakfast (due to his lack of speech and limited words we had him point to the menu) my dad ordered his own food and a cup of coffee. (I filled in the staff and informed them that he is fine "upstairs" but he just cannot fully vocalize his thoughts) they were a great help. I showed him how to get into the elevators and I must say, after the 1st day he was already a pro at this. By day 2 they had both gone to breakfast and dinner later that evening....on their own no less. The Remington Club has really given them their own independence while also providing any assistance they may need. My mother absolutely loves to sit in the sun on her balcony (I love the fact that she is outdoors and soaking up that Vitamin D) 😉 I have been going there daily to help them out with the move and have become a familiar face with both the staff as well as some residents. The staff is very courteous and friendly and I am speechless on how happy I am that we moved my parents into this facility. They definitely provide "5 star service". I am excited for my parents and their new journey at the Remington Club. (as of July 6th 2018 my mom will no longer be at the Remington Club, however we just wanted to say that she has really enjoyed her time here, she has been at the SNF a few times as was always treated with great care)<//Review><user_name>gman829dixon<//user_name></record>

My dad moved there two years ago and I have been impressed with pretty much everything. The facilities are really nice and very well maintained. They take pride in personalizing the decor and much of the art and memorabilia come from, or directly honor, the residents themselves. I think that makes the place more “homey” and helps with the good report the residents have with the community and staff. The staff is very responsive, seem well trained and while there is definitely a sense of class about this place, the atmosphere is also very laid back. Its easy going there and you can feel it. And the staff honestly care which makes me believe that they are fairly compensated and treated with respect. I’ve never seen any of the staff looking like they were having a bad day. And of course the residents seem genuinely happy there too. The location is perfect, right next to that giant mall. There are restaurants, coffee shops, a supermarket, post office, etc., and it's all within walking distance. They have ambassadors that help residents run errands so that residents can really maintain a sense of minimal dependence (i.e., maximum independence). And if they don’t want to shop or cook then dining facilities are available and they are really good. I’ve eaten many meals there with my dad and it’s always good, and often great. And of course there are tons of activities available. If your parent(s) like to stay active they will have many opportunities to do so. The residents organize activities themselves and there are also plenty of community activities available and even public activities (like visiting lecturers who come give talks of general interest that are open to the public). The RC definitely tries to be a part of the larger community of Rancho Bernardo. I believe that helps create a feeling that this is an integral part of the surrounding community rather than just a safe place to stick an aging parent.

I highly recommend the Remington Club in Rancho Bernardo. It’s a safe, enjoyable, easy-going yet classy community with tons of stuff available for those seniors who want to stay active in their lives.<//Review>< resp>

A decent place to live, but the management is not very good.  It can take weeks to have a problem fixed, and they are not honest about the costs of moving out.  Although I had the apartment professionally cleaned, I was still charged for cleaning, trash removal and painting. I would avoid unless you have no other choice.</Text>

They're really great here, in all honesty. Chuck is an awesome guy. and the ladies are wonderful to work with. I'm rating 4 stars only because the neighbors are A-holes who can't seem to mind their surroundings and love to blare music from their cars at all hours of the night.< /text>

<Text>Have a huge issue with large roaches coming up through the drains. The best they will do for you, is tell you to buy bleach and pour it down the drains. The only pool always clean is the large pool by the main office. The others are nearly always filled with leaves and bugs. They are raising the rent, wouldn't recommend  to anyone< /Text><Rating>1< /Rating><name>Samie</name><userid>114868858677830886661<//userid>< Time>

<Review>I have lived at the regent for 3+ years. Its one of the most mismanaged apartment complexes i have ever lived in. They constantly raise rent and screw up the most simple aspects of property managment. I would avoid this place if you can. It looks nice on the outside but isnt so sweet once you have signed the contract.< /Review><time>1508459413593</time>< Name>

<Review>I really like this laundromat. It opens early and the machines are clean. You can clean the lint trap before you use the dryer. The bathroom is accessible and you don't have to pay to use it. Nice.< /Review><Name>Michelle Hineson< /Name><Rate>5</Rate><pictures>None<//pictures>< Date>

<Review>Ive never had a complaint. Fairly clean. Gets the job done. An all gender restroom that comes in very handy is an addition perk to all of us who need to do our laundry there.</Review>< Rate>

The prices are quite reasonable and you can use your debit \ mastercard , i used my venmo card directly on the machine. This is the first time i have seen this. The manager is on site cleaning and making sure you have everything you need and all your questions are answered. I loved this laundromat in my early 20s and now at 37 i still will drive out of my way to use this one if i dont have a washer and dryer to use. Put my laundry in and go next door to get a slurpee.

Used because washer is broken, not bad if it weren't for a few broken machines, lost a few quarters cause of that.
If you don't find the right looking machine better hope it washes good too. It cleans most of my clothes but sometimes leaves soapy or still kinda dirty clothing.
Entertainment is a game system joystick one with multiple games of which are good and while waiting you can have a cheap 1 dollar cup of soda at the 7 eleven next store. So at least it doesnt feel too long for laundry. Mostly Efficient and entertained 3.5<//Text>

{'time': 1556607692388, 'text': 'We are sorry you feel this way Mandy.  We take great pride in keeping our machines working.  They all get inspected several times a month.  However, as with any machine, they do occasionally not work.   In those instances, they are shut down and parts are ordered.  Although, we wish parts would always be available and arrive in 1 day, sometimes they do not.  In addition, the mechanic is not always available when we need him.  In regards to “everything is dirty” we again will have to agree to disagree.   We work tirelessly cleaning the store.   Doing so several times a day.  We unfortunately can’t be there 16 hours a day, but with the cameras, we do our absolute best to keep an eye out and constantly run down there to clean when necessary.  We have our number all over the store and would appreciate using those numbers if you have issues and we will be happy to take care of them.\n\nEDIT:  Again since it’s been one day since your last “rating”, obviously the same machines are still down until parts/mechanic arrive.  Again, we can only take care of that so fast.  A machine spilling water all over the floor is either too much detergent or a machine being improperly loaded.  We can assure you that every laundromat in America has this problem despite the numerous signs instructing customers how to properly run the machines.  Either way, we assume your washing and drying experience was perfect which is what we always hope.  If not, our phone number is all over the store and we are always glad to help our customers.'}</Response>

After a long detailed reply from the business I decided to grant them 3 stars. So today I again did laundry. Many machines were again out of order and one was spilling water all over the floor. But the dryers were running hot and the machines did not eat my change. So 3 stars.< /review>

This is my favorite laundrymate. The place is always clean (minus dirty lazy people not picking up after themselves). The machines are always working when I go there. Prices are good. I love that I can use my debit card to pay for my washes. They just installed 2 new really big washers that are worth the money with all the loads you can put in it. The driers never burn or overheat  my clothes because the manager sets it to the right temperatures. If the machines take extra money from me for whatever reason, you can leave a note and they will call you back  in a timely matters. I got my money back when I had an issue. The people who run the place are awesome! Always so friendly. Wish they were open just a little later for us people who get out late from work or school. Overall. LOVE THIS PLACE!!!<//text>

The machines are dirty and falling apart and they take your money but won't start. I had a machine steal $6. There's a sign to request a refund but there were no forms to fill out. I DO NOT recommend this place at all.< /text>

I have visited some laundries around the South of Bakersfield, this one is in particular the cleanest, the machines wash excellent and there’re different size of load. The bathroom is clean and equipped, there is sink and paper towel available. I have seen staff cleaning and maintaining the machines. Ample parking and shops around.< /text>

This place is disappointing. It's dirty, washing machines look like they're falling apart.dryer doors don't close right. It's like they leave them like that on purpose so you can stay putting in quarters.by the  time your clothes dry you've put in like $2. SMH😒 I'd go else where if I had transportation.< /review>

Sunday was indeed dirty as we had family issues at the hospital so we’re unable to be there that day until the evening.  Our washing machines and dryers are very solid so if you’d like to let us know which ones you believe weren’t working properly, we would gladly take a look and repair if needed as well as refund if needed.  Our machines are tested very regularly to make sure they are working at their best.  However, they are machines and will break down occasionally.  Rest assured, they will never be put back into service until they are looked at and repaired.  Lastly, we don’t keep dryer doors open so you spend more.  We could go into great detail about the running of the machines, but dryer doors need to fall into a range of how “tight” they are.  Too loose, they open.  Too tight and the glass could break causing a hazard.'}<//Resp>< gmapID>

<review>This is a nice and quiet place. The owner happened to be there and my hubs and I got to chatting with him. They are fair on prices and he even replaced your funds if the machine took it. He was right there ready to pay. I wasn't afraid to do my laundry. He made sure that his place was quiet and respectful. He even commented he was about to leave but they got super busy and he stayed to make sure no one fought over a machine. No tolerance for any non sense.<//review>< pics>

First of all the prices are not bad, but the washers wash the clothes but they don’t rinse the clothes good  enough ,  Clothes came out of the washer very damp, Wasted more money on the dryers to dry my clothes will not be back! Very disappointed I think they make the washers not to rent close enough so you don’t waste your money on the dryers this is done on purpose, Do not come here do not waste your money I wish I can get a refund but I can really doubt, that very dirty😡<//Review>

I really like this laundromat because it's not too far from me and because I can use my debit/credit card so that I don't have to carry a huge bag of quarters. Also, they have large commercial size washer and dryers so that I can put 2 or 3 loads in one commercial sized washer/dryer. Unfortunately, the city may tear down the building to make way for Hwy. 58 expansion. Hopefully, that won't happen too soon. The owner has owned this laundromat for over 20 years.  I hope that, if the building does get torn down, that the owner will relocate to another facility close by.< /Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Tripple washer broke in the middle of washing cycle. Water everywhere! Tried my best to clean it upwith paper towels. There is no emergency number and voicemail to main # says they're no accepting calls because of a death in the family. As a business you still need an emrgency #! I used all the paper towles on sight and laid a laundry cart down where there is water in hopes no one slips. I did leave a message expalinging situation. I also spent alot of money trying dry my soaking wet towles in the dryer as it looks like the machine got stuck on the rinse cycle. Its still gushing water, not sure what to do. Where is the owner or helper or a working #??????n<//Text>< Resp>

{'time': 1476578858667, 'text': "We are always happy to refund when customers aren't happy.  We have our phone number posted in three different areas of the store and have not received any call.   You are still welcome to call us at 661-204-2805.  We are open 17 hours a day/seven days a week so it is nearly impossible to be there all the time and like most laundromats, it would be very difficult to keep costs down if we had full time staff.  We believe our customers would rather keep prices as low as possible."}< /resp>

Nice and clean. Would be nice if the bathroom was open when the business is open.

6.11.21 - It costs $1.25 for a 30 min dry. Dryer will not start unless $1.25 inserted. What if it it doesn't take 30 min for what I'm drying to dry? I'm losing out on money and dry time. Why pay extra for what I'm not using. The option of $0.25 per 6 mins should still be available and not only after the fact.< /Text>

<response>{'time': 1551838428273, 'text': 'Thanks for the review Karaya.  As stated in the note, we knew dryer pricing isn’t perfect for everyone but we were getting several calls a week because people would put 2 or three quarters in 12-18 minutes and were confused why there clothes weren’t dry.  In addition, we haven’t raised prices in over 11 years on the dryer and we had to.  So our option was to lower to 25 cents per 4 minutes or “bundle” it to keep it at six.   So if we kept it at the four then you’d be actually getting much less time while paying more.   The cost 💲 of running and repair is extremely expensive and as always we are doing everything possible to keep costs down.\n\nWe are sorry that due to the homeless problem and drugs, we must keep it closed unless we are present.   We do occasionally leave it open until the drug problem starts returning which it unfortunately always does.'}</response><GmapID>0x80ea6a0848e6b899:0x25ea830f6fc289f1<//GmapID><pics>None</pics><user>109019112217109954164</user><Time>1623426984178< /Time></record>

We even checked the camera on the day of your review and we had 3 machines out of order out of over 50.  During the pandemic, as with many things, parts often are delayed where they weren’t before, but we have done what we can to fix everything ASAP.  Also to say we hardly clean is simply not true.  The store is cleaned several times a day and we’ve spent large sums of money on products that again the pandemic has made in short supply.  Obviously as an unattended store, we can’t guarantee every piece of trash will be picked up immediately, but to say that it is hardly cleaned is just wrong.'}< /Response>

<Review>What can I say about the property manager Teresa.
She is always such a big help to so many people at this property. She's  always saying hello to everyone and asking how there say is and just that alone puts a smile on people's faces. She's  always cleaning the property so it looks nice for everyone.  She is really an amazing  person alone.. I would definitely  recommend  this property to anyone. Keep up the great work Teresa.</Review>< user>

<Review>This is a wonderful place to store your excess stuff. Indoor lockers and closets protect your articles from the weather, and you don't have to stand in the rain to sort or organize your belongings. The staff are friendly, helpful, and courteous. The electric gate and multiple security cameras offer security and confidence, and the gate has never hit my car or run over my foot!</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><GmapID>0x808e32e4720a8493:0xb630212f02b591e5</GmapID><Time>1576115567513<//Time><Response>None</Response></record></dataset><record>

yesterday I had a long drive from Los Angeles to San Jose. Unfortunately, I was running late and was worried that I would not make it in on time. However, Michelle (front desk rep) was wonderful and ensured me that she will way for me for 15 minutes after 5:30pm to ensure that I get my unit that day. All other storage unit locations were quick to tell me that they can not help and Michelle did help. I went in and she answered all of my questions and gave me additional information that is important. Over all she was very pleasant and showed that she cares for her customers.

As for the unit, I got a 5x 10 and stored my belongings for a studio apartment. Everything fit in there very well. My bolt recommendation is that you buy moisture control for the unit so your things don’t get moist and stinky (they sell it on property). I unfortunately did not purchase it and went into the unit feeling the moisture. The associate will try to sell it to you on the spot so it would be something to consider.

HAPPY STORING!<//text>

I called in for quotes and availability. The customer service representative Sandra Vargas answered all my questions both professionally and efficiently. She also had great feedback in regards to the area and location this storage is located. I will definitely be doing business with this location.<//text>

I'm calling about the property manager at the storage unit on snell ave her name is Cody .She is by far the best manager you have. She is very polite and very  considerate. She is very helpful and can answer any questions that you have. You should be very grateful that you have and she is a model what the other managers should be.< /Text>

<Review>5 stars for customer service for District Manager, Joseph Ortiz. I have been dealing with Public Storage for many years at many different locations throughout California as a designer, furniture store manager, stager and now an American Cancer Society Discovery Shop manager in San Jose. We recently combined two storage units in different locations and there was a lot of red tape and miscommunication. Joseph stepped in and went the extra mile to handle the complicated administrative mess. I am ever so grateful that he made it all happen without extra expense to American Cancer Society.
He always answered his phone and promptly returned emails. He  was calm,  polite and very professional.  I have to say that dealing with Public Storage has not always been a pleasant experience, but working with Joseph is.</Review>< pics>

Alycia knows her stuff! Very kind and resourceful. Units she showed us were very clean, well lit and as difficult as putting your entire life into storage can be, she made it a pleasant experience.  They offer competitive pricing, provide excellent customer service and I'd be happy to recommend this location to anyone I know. Thank u!<//Review>

In a moment of stress their manager was kind and helpful. She walked me through all the procedures and she tried to get me the best price possible. I truly believe that if I were to need to rent again, I would definitely come back to this location for giving me the best customer service. Thank you public storage for hiring the best employees.

I had a horrible day coming back and forth trying to reserve a unit and continue my move. I was rudely addressed by the customer service call center and they booked my reservation at the wrong location. However fortunately i was sent to this location and was greeted by Michelle A. Who completely turned my day around and my frown upside down. I wish i was referred to her to begin with.< /review>

Rochelle is great when it came to finding us the right space for the best price. She was very knowledgeable when it came to our needs. She friendly and made the renting process a breeze. I will recemond her to all my friends and family. She is really that great. Never experienced such a nice person. Customer service was excellent.<//Review>

<review>Not only was Rochelle thorough she didn't try to upsell me with stuff I didn't need. I was able to meet her for a tour and get all signed up in about 20 min. She was able to answer all my questions completely without the run around. Thanks for all your help, very much appreciated!!!< /review></record>

So I call to inquire about information and prices of the storage units and the girl I talked to is named Victoria Ruiz. She was the most amazing person I've talked to you on the phone in a very long time. I usually get rude people or people that just want to rush me off the phone and Victoria was nothing like that. She helped me with all my questions, gave me different options of prices and different sizes of their storage units. She just answered all my questions and was really nice and thoughtful about it. I will definitely be looking into getting a storage unit just because of my great experience with Victoria.< /text>

I was very impressed by their staff. First I called their 800 number to find a location and after asking what I plan to store, recommended the perfect size and a convenient location. The manager on location, Alycia, was super friendly, courteous and helpful. Highly recommend this place.</Review>

Rochelle the property manager made my life so much easier! She helped me out to find the right storage and suggested to get mattress covers. She was quick and clear on describing everything that I need to know! Definitely, will suggest her property to any of my friends who will need a storage.</review>

This place is absolutely the worst. 5 stars are given because the management asks customers for a favourable review at point of sale. My unit was robbed, 7 total broken into. Save your money and belongings.< /Review>

Paul, the office manager, was extraordinarily helpful in helping me select a locker sized for my needs at a reasonable price.  I found it clean and easy to access.  When I was done using it, final check-out took just a couple of minutes.  I will consider this location for my future storage needs.< /text>

My wife Donna and I use this Public Storage for supplies and inventory for our business, Kadori Gifts.  This place is fantastic for three reasons:

1.  People - Juanita and Paul are absolutely great!  Very friendly, supportive and always accommodating when we need help like borrowing a hand truck.
2.  Location - Its only blocks from our house and has great access to Capital Expressway, Hwy 85 and Hwy 87, so we can easily get anywhere in the bay area.
3.  Facilities - They keep this place neat and clean, just how we like it.

We highly recommend this Public Storage location for anyone who needs some extra space in a clean, well managed location with friendly staff!</Review>

It is not at every storage place that one gets both efficiency and friendliness.  Juanita, who works part-time at the 3911 Snell Avenue Public Storage, exhibits both these qualities.  She went the extra mile to arrange the use of a flatbed cart that I could return the next day and showed me all the "ins-and-outs" of the 10 x 10 space and its locking mechanism plus the codes for entering/exiting the premises and for getting into the G Unit.  I appreciated the mixture of professionalism with the ability to share humorous anecdotes about life at the Ps where she works.  When suggestions were made that could improve the service, she was quick to make an appropriate notation.  Juanita's personality combined with "the personal touch" helped make my stay an enjoyable experience.<//text>

< Review>
Finally done w/ this place.

They recently cut back their hours of access and close at 6pm now. Then, raised their rates 20% out of no where (just so happens was 2 months after i moved units to save 20% in monthly fee's), stating they were needed for upkeep (they just repainted the place a month before, seriously?). Both, big red flags for me since this place is nothing amazing.
Unless you never access your storage, or are a flea market vendor, I'd pick another place to store your belongings.

The upside is, the people who work there are really nice.

SO! glad to be out of there.

Ps. Thought I should update this review since I've now been getting calls from the staff saying that anything under a 5star review for this location gets the staff in trouble from their corporate managers. So, here's a 1 star review. This 1 star is not because of the employees (which btw were always helpful and nice), but because of the policies put into place by the higher ups. If it's the truth that district managers come down on property managers for them enforcing your (public storage) changed policies, and ex-customers leaving honest reviews, then I'm even happier I got out of giving this company my money every month.< /Review>

<review>I've called around for storage prices and Elizabeth was extremely professional over the phone and suggested on the size I should rent. She was extremely helpful and loved that she speaks Spanish and made moving my mom so much easier.<//review>< rating>

I love this storage facility because Alycia has the best people skills of all the managers I have ever met at Public Storage. Nobody is as kind and patient when dealing with customers as Alycia. Alycia leads the example of a perfect PUBLIC Storage manager.< /Review>

Theres always trash all over the place! At least one unit a week is broke into but, nobody hears about it because the live in & onsite manager covers it up to keep the public & = office find out!
The manager there is one of them smile in your face type of people, watch out for her!
She is mean, lazy & unprofessional! If you need somebody to help you move in or out you better have them on you list to enter because, she will be rude to them & tell to leave! I used to help her clean around the facility but she changes up like the waves in an ocean! She tries to get you to write a good review for her to make her quota for the month. Once you do shell go back to that smile in your face kind of person! Bottom line, 3911 snell avenue location sucks!<//Review>< rate>

Been here for a few years now bc I let my office go while having hardship with my business. During my stay here I've experienced many things and mostly negative but since Alycia has been in management I changed my outlook here overall. She has done a fantastic job in keeping up the place and making sure things are in order. Alycia has really brought up the value in public storage here compared to before. I feel so much better knowing she's taking care of business and I believe many would agree here. Keep up the good work!< /Text>

Rochelle is awesome! The most friendly and talkative property manager i've ever had dealings with! She was genuinely helpful and answered all questions and believe me I had alot.

Located at the corner of First Street and South Livermore Avenue in downtown Livermore, Lizzie Fountain Park is the city’s most easily accessed municipal park.

It’s a popular meeting place for locals in the evenings and on the weekends. During the summer months, the park’s fountain features a popular splash pad that’s a big hit with little ones looking to cool off.

For parents who’d rather not get wet, there are some close-by seating areas that allow them to see all the action while staying dry.

The park is close to many popular evening attractions like bars, restaurants, and theaters.< /text>

Great place to stop with the kids or to just have a relaxing moment. At night the LEDs illuminate the water beautifully and makes for a great stop on a warm summer Livermore evening.</text>

One of the fun, free things to do in the heart of downtown Livermore. Great gathering place to socialize, enjoy the view, and/or be like the many kids and run through the water fountain.

Plenty of benches to sit and drink a cup of coffee from the nearby Peet's or eat a pastry or two from French bakery Casse Croute.< /review>

Really cute park. It’s fun for the kids to run around in the fountain in the summer. It’s also a great place to sketch and relax. This park is really cute. I come here all the time.</Text>

Good spot downtown to let the kids run around and cool off. Most of the kids are under 10 with a majority being under 6. Fountain gets shut off late at night so better chance of the water staying clean. I've never seen issues of people bathing in it.< /Text>

Great little spot to watch people stroll by or to meet up with friends. In the summer the fountains are a nice way to cool down for a bit.</review>

<review>One of the great attractions of downtown Livermore. Great on a hot day. Water fountain is attractive and fun. Kids love it. When you step on it, it squirts water high in the  air. Benches available to sit and relax and have a little fun. My grandson loved it. Very enjoyable. My kifs used to love it too. They are grown now. It's continually improved  and I recommend it.

I recently received a painless operation to remove a cataract from my left eye, and my recovery has already exceeded my expectations.  SoCal Eye provided this service for me on my right eye about three years ago, as it seemed to be the weakest of my set at the time.  My vision improved with that action, though I could still detect a color difference between them.  Now everything is much brighter, and I can read the disclaimer small print on all the tv drug ads.  And on today's bike ride, I spotted two dollar bills lurking at the curb.  Things are looking up, so to speak.< /text>

< Review>
This clinic appears to have issues with over booking. My appointment was at 2:30, but I didn’t see a doctor until 4:30. And two hours of that time was spent in the waiting room! - Not exaggerating. The doctor and staff are very pleasant and professional, but I only got to see the doctor for maybe 5 minutes, maybe it was 7 minutes. The medical technician was awesome. But I was told by the staff that I would be fine to drive after my eyes were dialated. Yes I could drive but I couldn’t see the signs and exits! This was terrible advice. I should have arranged a transport. It’s true that their technology looks modern, and the team seemed highly qualified. I question the integrity of the owners. The over scheduling looks like greed.<//Review>

Our doctors and staff try their best to keep the schedule on track, but occasionally the doctor needs to spend extra time with another patient. Also, for the health and well-being of our staff and patients,  we have increased sanitizing protocols, which may take a bit longer than usual. We take your feedback to heart, and will strive to do better. If you need anything in the future, please give us a call. -The SoCal Eye Team'}< /response>< gmap_id>

I stopped by SoCal Eye office yesterday just to check if I can make appointment for eye exam I asked the lady, she told me to wait she will find out, I waited less than 15 minutes she took me to see the doctor and the eye exam was done it was very impressive.</review>

< Review>
Positive aspects: My eye doctor was attentive, explained things well and made me feel confident that I was treated properly.
Annoying and poor aspects: Having an initial intake conversation by phone, 2 weeks before my appointment, where the receptionist completely screwed up my insurance information. I was called by a second person 30 mins before I had to leave for the actual appointment  to take my insurance info all over again. She couldn't explain the insurance info that was on my chart and suggested that I might not want to drive there in case they didn't take my insurance. All they had to do was call the phone number on my insurance card and get the proper info in 5 mins or less. Once I had the appointment the Optometric exam was covered. But  then they wouldn't accept my insurance for the lenses. Finally, the office was run down, the entrance to the building is poorly marked,  and I would prefer to find another optometric resource for future exams.</Review>

<user_id>112445941172616409358< /user_id><Text>Dr. Hartmann, Dosha and Juan were wonderful. They were very professional while making me feel comfortable. Communicated with me very well. The issue I had was with the wait time and the front desk staff. My appointment was at 1000 but I wasn’t brought back until 1045. After my appointment I was waiting to schedule my follow up. While my chart was on the counter the front desk staff was doing something else, calling patients to schedule appointments. I had to go to the desk to ask how much longer just to make an appointment. I was apologized to and an appointment was made. Hopefully the wait time isn’t as long the next time because I really like Dr. Hartmann and the clinical staff. The front desk may benefit from a review of their process to stream line the work flow.</Text><Time>1617918239437< /Time><Gmap_id>0x80dd32e156015a29:0x2d660558201233ce< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I give SoCal Eye my highest recommendation.  My husband got some sap in his eye from a pencil cactus.  He was in extreme pain.  SoCal Eye was able to get him in almost immediately to see a doctor.  Dr. Ling was outstanding. He was extremely professional and knew exactly what to do.  His eye felt so much better after seeing the doctor.

My husband did have to visit SoCal Eye one time before about a year ago when he got some saw dust in his eyes even though he was wearing safety glasses.  So this is his SECOND time visiting SoCal Eye.  Both times they got him in right away and provided outstanding care.<//text>

Each employee with whom I came in contact was very courteous and friendly. Gillian, who performed the necessary tests  was very patient and informative in answering my questions and explaining what was being done. Dr. Clay set me at ease and explained what the future cataract surgery would entail. Her assistant Maria was very friendly and professional. Just a follow-up - just had my second visit yesterday for measurements prior to cataract surgery, again a different member of the team, but the same level of efficiency and professionalism!!!<//text>

I was very pleased with the service that I received from beginning to end.  The assistant  (Delores or Dolores) was very pleasant and sanitized EVERYTHING in my presence.  She explained everything that was going to happen,  how it was going to take place and  gave me an opportunity to ask questions as she proceeded to do her job, that alone gave this office a  10 in my eyes. The doctor then came in and validated everything that the assistant had done.  I watched her sanitize while she explained the procedure  and asked for questions.  The doctor told me everything that she was going to do BEFORE she did it and was very pleasant as well.  This office gets a 10 from me and that is not an easy thing to get as I am definitely a germaphobe and I watch everything.<//text>

Very well organized  reception.  Had my temperature taken, checked in, and was shown where my exam would be. I received a very thorough examination.  Every step was explained to me.  Went to order my new glasses.  Was given the time to check out and try on many different styles.  The order process was efficient and quick.  Can't wait to go pick up my new glasses!< /Review>

Excellent first visit. I actually came a day early by mistake , however they were able to slide me into an available slot. After a short wait, a delightful man named Mario called me back for my history and preliminary testing. A+ for patient care.

Dr. Larry Pasquali , the Opthalmologist, was fantastic. He went over my medical history with me, performed an exam and explained in detail the results. He gave me a chance more than once to ask questions. It was nice not to be rushed. I also applaud Dr Pasquali for being thorough with my medication and medical histories.

I appreciated his thoroughness more than I can say. I've visited a number of practitioners over the years who made it obvious with their questions that they did not even give the forms I'd filled out a cursory glance.

I would highly recommend this office for your eye care needs.< /text>

<text>The entire SoCalEye team is terrific.  This was my first visit to their Lakewood location.  New faces but still that same friendly demeanor that I am used to with their Katella crew.   Marco, the technician, was a true gentleman and he explained everything he was going throughout the preliminary examination.   I not only got my eyes examined but I learned some new things in the process.   Dr. Pascuali is THE BEST.< /text>< Pictures>

First of all, I didn't have to wait long at all even withCorona-19 going on. Everyone had to wear a face mask while all their chairs in the waiting room were carefully spaced out.

I was called into a room where their equipment was. The main assistant took my medical history, prescriptions taken and  all entered into her computer while explaining all to her intern assistant.

We went to another room where a more modernistic machine to take pictures of the back of my eyes - because I have Type2 Diabetes and
they wanted to make sure that I don't have diabetic damage.

I felt comfortable the whole time I was there. Two thumbs up for my main assistant for her knowledge and ease of caring not only for the patient, but for her love of the optical field.

Forgive me for forgetting to bring my bifocals and written prescriptions/medical history.

Thank you all,

Fantastic office for eye exams as well as urgent eye problems! Staff was the utmost  friendly kind from the front doorman to the doctor doing the exam with his assistant. There was a training in process with a new hire & the trainer was the most professional & patient with the trainee. I would want to train here as an eye professional! This particular day I had a lot of appointments where one was for my dog where I had to bring him along for the trip and the staff was so kind & ok with my dog being there. SoCal Eye you are doing a FANTASTIC job! Keep it up!<//review>

The front desk staff are very welcoming and accommodating, Mario the tech who did tests was very polite, professional and supportive. The doctor, however lacked empathy and did not make me feel my concerns were fully addressed.<//review>

Very well sanitized equipment with Masks and social distancing. So that made me comfortable.  The only thing was my appt for eye test and see Dr was at 11:30 and I left at 1:30. Way too long waiting in between. But the technicians I saw were very patient and friendly and Dr Clay is a great Dr.< /text>

<Review>I have been a patient at SoCal Eye Physicians for a few years now. I was diagnosed with an acute angle closure on my right eye back in 2012. Dr. Hartman was able to perform an iridectomy successfully. After a few weeks, I didn’t have to take Latanoprost anymore.

I came back under this medical group’s care a few years ago for my annual eye check ups. Dr. Kwok is a wonderful and well informed optometrist. He always checks the pressure in my eye to ensure that the acute angle closure doesn’t occur again.

The other staff are very professional, too. Whenever I call to make an appointment or reschedule, they are always accommodating and helpful.

Thank you, SoCal Eye Physicians and staff, for your assistance!< /Review>< Resp>

Everyone in this office was amazing!  VERY nice, not rushed.  Wait time was short considering my PCP got me a same day appointment.  They are attentive, and listen to your concerns. Their communication was clear, allowing for questions and I never felt rushed.  I would highly recommend this practice.</Review>

< review>
After my early arrival for my eye doctor's appointment, I flipped through the latest magazines and reviewed the most recent medical advancements as I also, calmed myself for a very pleasant eye exam. Everyone who greeted and assisted me were excellent to work with.
In addition the doctor and the staff were very pleasant and displayed their excellent knowledge in a very professional manner. I was quite impressed.

Thanks for helping me.

Be blessed,

Eleanor DeVoe</review>

<review>This office is so impersonal.  The front staff treat people as if they were automatons.  They are also condescending. After reopening with the pandemic still here, the office staff has been replaced by a "call center" which seems far worse for making an appointment and communication than before.  It seems as if the group that has the business is just  interested in not creating clear communication, but about money and expediency and could care "less" about their patients.<//review>< time>

<username>Keshav Budhia< /username><review>I was at the SoCal Eye for annual Eye exam. At the appointment time of 9:20 am I was taken in and got my eye exam completed in about 45min. The hospital staff treated me respectfully and explained in detail how my eyes are. They told me to come back in one year.  There is a beginning of cataract but not to worry about it now because as the doctor said it will take a long time but they will keep checking it.<//review>< Gmap_id>

Most appointments are very good and happy people.  This was the same. I had my meds on the counter and Dr asked about refills and I said yes and he said we'll submit for everything to be refilled.  When I went to pharmacy to pick up, I was missing two and they showed me the request from the Dr's office and the two missing weren't ordered.  Now I have to call Dr's office and go back to pharmacy to pick up the two missing prescriptions.  With Covid-19 I'm at an age I don't got out any more than necessary and this 2nd trip shouldn't be necessary!  J<//text>

< Review>
A truly first time amazing experience .  I was concerned because the office looked big and there were eight ophthalmologist there +3 optometrist .  I was also nervous about having the cataracts in my eyes looked at .  The front desk was warm and welcoming and sweet and made me feel so comfortable .  After a short 10 minute wait for my appointment time I got called into a room .  Tim the ophthalmologist technician made me feel so comfortable he performed all the tests that needed to be done spent plenty of time chatting with me reassuring me that everything was good so far .  Then Dr. Ling  came in and continued with my eye exam looked at my cataracts and told me at this point they were mild to moderate I’d be able to pass my eye exam for my drivers license and not to worry until I had some symptoms and that he’d see me next year .   He also was kind and informative and took the time to make me feel comfortable .   I’ll be back thank you 😘<//Review>

The doctors are really nice and know their business. The only problem I had was scheduling a follow up appointment. They are booked months in advance, so if you have a follow up appointment to get contacts and require a doctor to see you before you can get them, it's really difficult to find a time that's convenient.<//review>

Recently, I underwent two cataract surgeries, one on each eye, at SoCal Eye Lakewood. Before the first surgery I was beyond scared. The nurses, the Anesthesiologist, and Dr. Emma Clay all helped to alleviate my fears. They were all professional, skilled, kind - a great team. Knowing what to expect the second time around, I felt more relaxed going into surgery. Once again, I was impressed by the skill of the team. They moved through an assembly line of sorts, operating on several people in one day, but still they took time to treat each one of us with skill and importance. Thank you Dr. Clay for doing an excellent surgery on both my eyes. Thank you Dr. Anesthesiologist for your kind manner in helping to calm me. Thank you Team for each part you played in my most successful outcome!<//text>

My 80 year father had the most abysmal encounter with staff members and Dr. Jastad. DO,  1/29/2020, he came in for an office visit; Staff contacted me at 2:16pm to inform me that he needed to have URGENT surgery at 7am  due to his eye being open and Authorization was needed immediately. At 5:17pm Dr. Jarstad reaches out to me to explain auth was not approved yet  and his surgery would be moved to 11am instead of 7am.  1/30/2020 at 9/29/2020 auth was approved office staff indicated needed to go to surgical center prior to 10:30am.. We arrived and checked in on TIME.. At 10:38am staff informed us that surgery has to be cancelled because Dr. Jarstad had office patients to see..  We were giving NO RECOURSE for how move forward..  We had to go to EMERGENCY room to have URGENT procedure completed to save his vision. Mind you he fasted for OVER 24hrs.

This is the MOST NEGLECTFUL AND INCOMPETENT OFFICE!!!!</Text>

The large number of styles of glasses gave me a good set of choices of a pair for myself. The courtesy and friendliness of the staff was refreshing and appreciated.  I really enjoy my improved focus of reading and distant vision.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Dr. Carl Hartman gave me a wonderful gift on March 25, 2014. It was the gift of clear vision by performing an amazing 12-minute cataract surgery. After the surgery I went out to dinner with  my husband! Besides his skill, one of the reasons it was amazing is because he gave me "mono vision" so I do not have to use reading glasses anymore! Now I can clearly see when reading books, computers, menus, art work, sculpting, and looking at labels for the best products! And I am writing this review the day after surgery! He said it will get better over the next three weeks. Not only that but I wish I had learned about him two years ago and had him correct my left eye cataract because I know I would have had better results. He is skilled, professional, and enjoyable. Two weeks before my right eye surgery he performed a laser treatment in my left eye. Now I can see so clearly that I sincerely feel like it's a miracle. I should mention that while waiting for my surgery the people next to me came all the way from San Joaquin Valley (300 miles away) to have Dr. Carl Hartman do their surgery. Impressive!<//text>< Pictures>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>I've been a patient at Lakewood Eye Physicians since 1990. From my 1st visit to my appointment last week, I've been treated like I'm truly special. Dr Ronald Hartman is my physician, he's super nice, very knowledgeable & funny. He's been treating my glaucoma since 1990 & told me I'm making him work too hard, with contagious laughter, because it's taken many combination of medications to keep my eye pressure at bay. The staff is so nice. They go the extra mile to make sure everything is understood & I don't usually wait very long in the examination room, which I so appreciate. If you don't have an eye doctor, I strongly recommend Lakewood Eye Physicians, newly named Southern California Eye Physicians & Associates. I love these people!<//Text>< Pictures>

Very professional, warm and friendly. The wait was reasonable, I was impressed.
Professionalism seems to be a thing of the past. The office staff was apologetic (the space is much to small) about the cramped surroundings. It was a pleasant experience.

<Rate>5</Rate><review>This clinic is great!   My 15 year old daughter had an emergency and had a contact stuck in her right eye.  Dr. Pasquali was so kind and so patient with her.  He tried for at least 60 minutes to help her get it out and she was in so much pain she wouldn't allow him to get it.   He spoke so nicely to her in order to keep her calm which I truly appreciated.   In the end she had to be sedated in order to get it removed and the surgical staff was just as amazing. They all spoke to her very sweetly as she was scared to death.   They talked her though the IV and made her feel extremely comfortable in a very stressful situation.    I highly recommend this clinic and appreciate their kindness in a very scary situation for my daughter.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80dd32e156015a29:0x2d660558201233ce<//gmap_id></record>

< Review>
We can't put a price tag on our eye sight. And when we discover a problem with our vision, we want to know we are receiving the best care. And, not only that, but we may need some hand holding in this frightening situation. I found all of that at SOCAL EYE Long Beach, Ca. I am so grateful for each person who works there because they take care of me as though I am a member of their family.
My doctor recommended them & I am extremely grateful he did. Thank you so much SOCAL EYE.< /Review>

<Review>Dr. Carl Hartman is a miracle worker.One month ago he implanted a lense in my left eye (cataract surgery),changed my distance vision from very poor to an outstanding 20/25,almost a perfect 20/20,beyond my wildest expectations; i had been very nearsighted all my life;imagine my unending elation for being glasses or contact lenses-free at this advanced stage of my life. He also worked around scars on my cornea that intensive RK had produced almost 30 years ago; and also,decided against using a more expensive type of lense (for which i would have paid myself),the results proving him absolutely right.I had suspected that the results were going to very good,given the massive pre-surgery preparations that i went trough.My eternal gratitude to you,Dr. Carl, and to everybody in your beautiful staff. God bless you all.</Review><date>1426396444018</date><Pics>None</Pics><Rating>5<//Rating>< Response>
