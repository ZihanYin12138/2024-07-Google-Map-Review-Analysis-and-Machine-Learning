This place has great tasting food. Tried the pizza and the calzone. They make the pizza in a small coal fired oven. The arugula salad was to my liking (sour dressing.) The Nutella pizza was interesting (my wife craved it not me) and sweet.</Text>

Great restaurant with super attentive staff.  The appetizers, the caprese salad, and the pizza were amazing. We ordered the pizza with buffalo mozzarella.  The quality and presentation of everything was excellent.  The interior and exterior were great. The vibe was very warm and inviting.  The only minor item was that the calculated tip on the receipt is based off of post-tax amounts which is common, but I still prefer the pre-tax calculation method.<//review>

Great IPA and the Charcuterie Board is great.  It is pretty well sized to feed 2 and isn't too expensive for the amount of food.<//Text>

<username>julie limbaugh<//username><review>It was good. We went with family who eat very clean and organic. We had the Misto board which was 3 cheeses, amazing bread,  two meats, olives, red and green grapes and fig jam. We also shared a Caesar salad and the Ceci bean salad and 2 Margherita pizzas. It was just right for 4 of us, maybe a little too much. We ate a LOT of bread, but the amazing thing is.....we didn't feel stuffed or heavy afterwards. The Caesar was dressed lightly, which was nice on a  warm evening and sitting on the back "porch" was lovely. I would definitely go again when in the area. P.S. Don't forget the chocolate covered Spumoni (a big ball of spumoni covered in a thin  eskimo pie-like shell of delicious chocolate).</review>< user_id>

Plan A was to go to the winery.  We did not get the reservations on time.  We decided to try the restaurant instead.  So glad we did.  They offered wine samplers (love the Chianti and Malbec) and the food paired lovely with the wine choices.  Staff was friendly and warm.  Can't wait to go back again.</Text>

Frequent this local eatery often for lunch. The staff is always SUPER friendly and helpful. The food is fast and tastes great (what could be a better combo?!) I don't think I have ever had to wait to long for a table here either. The Funghi pizza is definitely the one to try, I get it every time we are here!</Text>

Super cozy and nice. My GF and I love coming Sunday afternoons for beer and pizza. Food is great, I always order the same beer but it's great lol. The service may not be on your elbow 24/7 but it's a relaxed, family run small place. Relax, sit back, enjoy the afternoon/evening/your life.</Review>

<text>This place is such a cute local restaurant, microbrewery, winery. I've been here twice, once for a girls night out and today, for a date night with the hubby.  It's small and they don't take reservations so come early if you don't want to wait. Patio vs inside, I prefer inside since the patio overlooks a parking lot. Free parking in the lot behind the restaurant or free 1 hour parking on the street. They have a nice wine selection from Pozzuoli wine with their vineyard from Paso Robles, I love their Cabernet Sauvignon and Insieme. I've have both the wine sampler and tasting. I prefer the tasting since you can choose what wines. The sampler was ok, love that they served a white wine, Rose, and 2 reds but I only really loved the Rose and one of the reds.... I did enjoy their formaggio (cheese) plate with 4 types of cheese, grapes, hot slices of toasted bread, and olives. It was good, albeit a bit pricey. We fell in love with the goat cheese with chives and onion and bought an extra side for $4 to take home! Their microbrewery has a small but good selection of beer brewed on-site. Today, they were out of some of their beers so my husband tried their Avery White ale which is a guest ale, which was nice and light. They have an in-house honey cream ale which I would love to try next time it's available!

The last time I came here, the girls and I ordered a bruschetta appetizer which was amazing and their pizzas. We ordered an eggplant pizza which was so thinly sliced and fresh and light. Their salad was also delicious. Overall, a cute local spot to hang out, either for girls night, date night, or with friends. I can't wait to introduce more friends to this spot! Love their food, wine, and beer selection!<//text>< user_name>

Absolutely horrible experience here. Went here with a group of guys for my birthday with high expectations as it is so pricey. We didn't see a waiter for at least 15 minutes after being seated and didn't receive our waters for another 10 minutes after that. Upon ordering our food it took from 45 minutes up to an hour and a half for everyone in our group to receive their food. The real kicker is that we didn't receive our appetizers until after everyone had finished their entrees. It perplexes me how it took over an hour and a half for us to get a cheese platter. Additionally throughout the course of the meal, we saw our waiter 3 times. As a result our waters were only refilled at the beginning and end of our meals. Absolutely unacceptable. Now onto the food, it was OK, however no where near good enough considering how long we waited or how much we paid. It was terribly overpriced and the portions are very small. I wouldn't even recommend this restaurant to my worst enemy, that's how horrible our service was. I will never be going to Centro again and will continue to share my displeasure of it online and with acquaintances.<//Text>

This brewery may be small but delivers a big punch. It has an intimate setting with modern industrial design. Beers are limited but are very delicious. Food menu is small but you won't go wrong with your choices. Musty try their hummus and their salami Pizza. I had their Golden Ace west coast style IPA, 6.3 % ABV, 70 IBU. It tasted like Pliny the Elder! My server Sarah was awesome!< /text>

Customers are a lot more likely to remember how a place made them feel, and not so much the food that they ate. Last week, August 19th 2018 what was supposed to have been a great dinner with friends visiting from out of state, turned into the most bitter and humiliating experience. Three kids and two adults, we all ordered pizza. One of them was vegetarian covered with arugula from which a fly came out. Our server who happened to be also the owner Mrs. Daniella came along to bring us water and we showed her the fly. You won't believe her reaction...
She started yelling at us: "What are you trying to say? "Centro" has the cleanest kitchen on the block." "This fly came from the sky." Wow, if only we had known we would be yelled at, we would have never said anything.
The bill came, we asked Daniella if she would kindly remove from the bill the pizza, which we sent back almost untouched. And this is where it really got ugly, not least because she happened to be the owner. She got so mad, she pointed to my 5 year old son and asked: "Whose child is this?" She looked at him, pointing and yelling: "You are the worst behaved child that has ever visited this place. You went to the restroom three times...." Then she shouted to all of us; "Now go home! You are not welcome in my restaurant- ever again!" Her son also joined her, yelling at us to leave. Then she added: "You spoilt Americans, I hurt your feelings, right...."
And only because we had been silly enough to have pizza at her place.
Mrs. Daniella, I hope that once you start losing customers, you will remember not only to say the right thing at the right time, but far more difficult still, to leave unsaid the wrong things, no matter how tempting it might be to insult Customers who have had the audacity to speak up.<//Review>

{'time': 1535755175875, 'text': 'We love and appreciate all of our customers at Centro. There is a mutual respect among us. We always try our absolute best to accommodate our customers needs, and treat people with basic respect that they are entitled to. This is our goal now and will continue to be moving forward.\nUnfortunately, there was no reciprocal respect or decency from the moment this group walked in. They demanded to be sat right away even though we were pretty busy. They treated our staff like TRASH during the course of their entire visit. We have had a lot of customers over the past 3-1/2 years and we have never ran into a situation as bad as this. All very unfortunate.\nThe true story: They complained about a fly that flew into their pizza, in which we had no control over since they were sitting in our outdoor patio. We comp\'d the pizza. Their children were unsupervised the entire time they were in our restaurant. Running around, disrupting service and banging on the restroom doors and yelling to other customers "when are you coming out". We love and welcome kids at Centro...this became an unfortunate situation where our business was being disrupted and other customers were getting annoyed. Like any other establishment, we expect parents to parent and supervise their kids. We are proud grandparents and understand how kids can be.\nLike everyone else we expect to be treated respectfully and with decency. We reserve this right.'}</response>

What a wonderful, tiny place in old town Tustin.  They have very tasty appetizers, nice Italian style sandwiches, and authentic thin crust pizzas.  In addition, they have a little brewery on site and sell their wine - the grapes come from their winery in Paso Robles.  Tiny but power packed.  I love the patio out back also.

It's a very nice addition to old town Tustin.  Give it a try.< /Text>

<review>Big news for beer and wine drinkers in Tustin. Centro, a winery and microbrewery, is now open in Old Town Tustin.

The brewery-restaurant is owned by Pozzuoli Vineyard & Winery, which is located in Paso Robles. (How often do you see a winery that lists its two locations as someplace in wine country, and Tustin?) Pazzuoli opened a tasting room in Tustin a couple of years ago at 15481 Red Hill Avenue, and now has opened this impressive location in Old Town Tustin.

I'm a wine fan, but what really got me excited about this place is the microbrewery. They call the beer side of the operation Archaic Craft Brewery. I visited on opening day, and they had four beers on tap, but only one was created in house, and that was the Honey Kolsch. If the Honey Kolsch is any indication of the brews we can expect from Archaic, then this place will be great for beer drinkers. It was a great German style Kolsch, with good mouth feel and no harsh aftertaste.

This is a true family business, with Enrico Pozzuoli as the winemaker, and his son Sandro Pozzuoli handling the brewmaster duties. I spent some time with Sandro discussing the beers he is brewing. His knowledge was apparent, and I was impressed that, even though he wanted to roll out a beer or two more for the grand opening, he held back because they weren't yet where he wanted them to be. Look for an IPA soon.

I'm hoping they will expand the number of available beers on tap. Certainly, if they want to make this a destination for microbrewery crawlers, they'll need a greater selection. But how many beers can you really drink? For now, live with four, and go to Centro to check out the impressive modern/rustic interior.

As to the food, we tried the Margherita pizza ($9) and the Hummus plate ($8) (we dug into hummus plate so quickly, we forgot to take a picture; picture above shows cheese plate ordered by another patron). Both were excellent. The pizzas are baked in a wood-fired oven. They also offer cheese plates, salads, paninis, and desserts.

Beers were $6 and $7 a pint, and the wine ranged from $10 to $15 a glass. Personal pizzas cost about $10 to $14. Some pizza is available by the slice for $4. If you like the beer, you can take a 32 or 64-ounce growler to go.

Centro is a great addition to Old Town Tustin. Be sure to give it a try.< /review>< pics>

Authority, and Staff got in my, Top-Secrect Buissness, publicly embarrassed me, said in front of the whole smoking area group, that there was a report or reports of me having needles in my pocket, so I emptied mutt pockets, to prove that I didn't, after I noted the public embarrassment, I was harrassed, domestically assaulted, and wrongfully banned from the property, when I asked for a grievance process, I was further harrassedand the false accusation of me not getting off the property, was publically stated during the church service, prior to their, feed out, as I was walking towards the door!< /text>

Be very careful about Donations.. The website is screwed up.
If you donate, it may say something like it could not be processed. But in reality it IS. I experienced this and tried a second time with same reslts. When i checked my bank it turns out i was  debited Twice. I don't mind giving a donation at all, but i don,t want to be dinged for two donations . It's not the amount of money, but if you don't have a ton of money in the bank, you may end up bouncing a check somewhere if you don't keep track</Text>

It does alot for the community.  But it needs alot from the city. Much help needed. Good place to go if you need food and a shower and supplies and shelter.  But the city needs to step up and help them get the place up to date .</Review>

<Text>If your truly homeless and don't want to be anymore, need a change of pace, or help making changes in your life this is a good place to start. No drugs of any kind. Even cannabis. But if u need a roof over your head and have the drive to get off the streets. They're there to help.<//Text>< resp>

< review>
The mission has saved my life. They gave me an oppurtunity to get off the streets and get sober. Three square meals a day and if u show up late or to early they make sure u get something to eat. If u wish to learn about God u can but its not shoved down your throat either. The guys and girls that help guide people here arent perfect and make mistakes but hold each other accountable are a true example of wut a christian should b. I thank God daily to live here and learn through them Gods will in my life.</review>

Great people everyone is pretty nice, but the owners do not take care of there people that well. They do a lot to help the community, they also have church services every night witch if u believe in God then it's great, if u do not not so great. They have wounderful food a great cook. All in all it's a great place. I miss everyone there. Pastor steve and miss anny r very great people. And I thank them very much for providing a great place for me to stay.<//text>

Did not do a good job in making my sandwhich, was an online order.  They did not add lettuce to my footlong and when I called to let them know the girl was rude and when I asked for the manager she said she would be there in the morning and "Good Luck Getting A Hold Of Her," in a rude way.  Will never go back again.</review>

Sandwiches are made with quality ingredients with on site oven baked breads. A good value for the price. Menu provides healthier choices for lunch or dinner.</review>

Absolutely terrible. There service has gone down so much it’s crazy. Went there for lunch with my boyfriend who used to work there and he was disgusted with how bad it has gotten and how rude the girl helping us was. We ate in the store and the meat in my boyfriend sandwich was ice cold. He asked for a new one and the girl got upset with him???? Just stay home if you’re going to have an attitude.< /text>

Typical subway. Nothing more. Nothing less. There is plenty of parking though. We usually go to this one because it is less busy than the other local subways.< /Review>

< Review>
I haven't been into a Subway in so long. I can't remember when.... But funny how this shows up, now... 😂

Stop making me crave at late hours... 😂

But the Meatball Marinara is the main reason I ever bother to go.

It's like lasagna in a bun.

Without having to bake it. 😂< /Review>

< Review>
Service is horrible u ask for something and they give what they want and then blame u for "not telling me u wanted it" I'm a subway customer and have never had issues until i stepped into this Fontana location (slover and sierra ave) ...if time allows u to go to another subway i suggest u go.<//Review>

<Review>This franchise owner needs to invest in a customer service class for his employees none of them and I do mean none of them ever smile, this guy tonight at almost closing time would not even look up when answering a question !

Just awful
Won’t be back here !!!

The girl making my sandwich seemed new she had to remake one of my sandwiches they ran out of onions.  One worker was cleaning walls tables and chairs right next to us, when I got home my shirt smelled like chemicals and burnt cheese.< /text>

I don't smell the pig but there's only two docs here, first come first serve 😣 first you must get a heavyweight then you have to go get an empty weight at the scale right outside the gate... Wish I had known that before I came through the gate 😖 not much room to wait  staging area< /Text>

Best pizza in sf! Better high end pizzas! Two locations, on Sloat by the beach and on Irving.

Make sure to get "Vegatarian with sausage" for a combo pizza!</review>

<rating>5<//rating><review>I had a great experience at Pasquale's! The staff was young, but very friendly.  They turned out a great pizza!  It was pepperoni and mushroom, with a great crust! Some pizzas seem a little overcooked.  This one was cooked just right, a soft and chewy crust, and not too crispy! I got a big pizza, and ate of off it for two days.  The crust wad still goes into the morning, and afternoon the next day.  Thanks Pasquale's for the great service, and great pizza!!!</review>< pictures>

Neat little local place just around the corner from the motel, great location easy axcess.  Friendly staff, the pizza looked and presented very well but lacked flavor and way to soft & greasy crust bottom for my preference.</review>

Called 30 min before closing. No one answers phone. I was at United Irish Cultural Center right next to Pasquale’s so I walked right over to order. Another person just walked out from ordering from the Center and I was told they quit taking orders already. Bold faced lied to me. The little white guy who knows nothing about customer service. The other guy was willing to take my order. When your open until 11:00 you don’t stop taking orders 45-30 before you close. The other reviewer was right. OWNER GET YOUR STAFF SOME CUSTOMER SERVICE TRAINING!<//Review>

We ordered a pizza to be delivered to us at work. The girl taking the order was a bit snarky, telling us it would be 45-60 for delivery. We are only just down the beach from them, but fine.
It arrived 75 minutes later and cold. We ate it because we were at work, what else could we do?
When I called this evening to ask about why it arrived cold they questioned why I was calling now, and why didn't i call when we discovered the pizza was cold.
Because we were at work, and it wasn't discovered cold until we got it inside, and we didn't have another 75 minutes to order and wait.
Again, we were working!
The best they could do for us was to offer us a few free toppings on our next order.
On our next cold pizza order?
No thanks.
Never again<//review>

To fazed. You do not know pizza if you truly think burnt pizza from Faradize is the best. Not only is it at its oiliest at Faradize, but it is also not real Italian pizza. If you ever had one. What was your next best Pizzeria Domino?<//review>

They have very delicious pizza. They know how to make excellent Italian food as well. This is coming from a guy from the east coast who knows how good pizza and Italian food should taste like.</Text>

Got a pie and some garlic bread and both were delicious! Service could be better but not an unfriendly place at all. A must have if you want Pizza down by the Zoo.<//Review>

<text>Good pizza but the place is dirty. Windows haven't been washed in forever, all the tables were dirty, and their bathroom is comparable to what you'd see at a BART station. They only have one driver so this is why they have horrible delivery times. This place has 5 star pizza but the other aspects of their business bring it down.< /text>< Pictures>

If your picking up a Pizza, this is the place to swoop, none of that dining in poop, I wouldnt call this a place with a dining room. Get yo pie, maybe a meatball sub and say peace, bye. The Irving location has nothin on Sloat, get you a hot Pie and stay off the dope! They only get 4 outta 5 because they charged me chump change for ranch even though I always tip when picking up. I'll get over it one day.</text>

Called for delivery and the guy that answered a few minutes ago sounded like he didn't wanna be there, asked for a Sandwich and he says ... "No More Sandwich... excuse me? You just opened! Yeah all gone and we don't get our Sandwich delivery til Tomorrow!!" So I'm confused they get their Sandwiches delivered and then they sit there all day? Eeewww lost my business!!< /Review>

< Review>
Awful experience, pizza was two hours late and then when it came it was the wrong order. They gave me a credit but when I tried to redeem it I found out it was just for a topping!

Go elsewhere.</Review>

We were happy that RepairSmith was in our area since we had several cars in our family that needed oil changes all at the same time. It was super simple to schedule and beyond convenient. Our technician Sou was outstanding, on time, professional and fast. Because of him and convenience we will definitely use their services again. Thank you again!<//text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

I chose this company, because the ease of someone coming to you when your car won't start seemed like a no brainer. I was very impressed that I could get next day service in Portland, OR.

First appointment: I scheduled the appointment for Sunday afternoon (2:30 PM - 4:30) and spent two hours waiting. After two hours went by, I called to check the status and learned the technician cancelled the appointment. The company simply deflected by saying that there was an attempt to e-mail me and that I must not have received it, which was not true. The soonest availability was Tuesday Morning. I e-mailed the company to notify them of my disappointment on the initial interaction and did not receive a response.
Second appointment: The technician was confident that all I needed was a new battery, but then determined that this was not the case and that I would need a new starter and mentioned that they had a 1 PM available the next day (Wednesday) and that they would get that time reserved for me.
Third appointment: One hour went by on Wednesday and they told me they put in a contingency time for 4:00 PM - 6:00 PM in case the technician is delayed.
Fourth appointment: The technician couldn't make this later time happen. I was rescheduled for the following morning (Thursday) from 8:30 AM - 10:30 AM.
Fifth appointment: The company notified me by 8:10 AM that the technician was not going to make it and wanted to reschedule for the following morning (Friday).
Sixth appointment: By 8:30 AM, my appointment has already been pushed back to 10:30 AM to 12:30 PM. I made a note that this appointment has already been rescheduled numerous times and was offered $25 off.

Pros (this was not an entirely negative experience, which is why I am giving one star): online scheduling, text reminders, transparent pricing--I appreciate the fact that the price of the initial diagnostic will be reduced from my final repair price, in addition to the discount for so many reschedules. The technician was professional, kind, and understood my needs. I really enjoyed the interaction that I had with them and have been looking forward to having them work on my car again this week.

If I could do things over again, I would have just called my insurance company and had my car towed to the nearest shop. I would have preferred for my car to sit for a week in a shop instead of continuing to be disappointed on a daily basis thinking that my car was going to be looked at. I have been trying to get this vehicle fixed up so I can sell it and purchase a more family friendly vehicle and my experience with RepairSmith significantly reduced the expediency in which I was hoping to do that. What seems like convenience (online scheduling, text reminders, credit cards on file for contactless payment) made me think that it would be taken care of in a timely manner and was ultimately a big distraction for how disappointing the entire process was. I will never use this company again.<//Text>

Ed was so awesome! I’d definitely recommend their service. Saved the hassle of towing my dead car to a shop during COVID. He was honest, thorough and didn’t try to sell me anything I didn’t need. Thank you repair smith!</Review>

I will NEVER hire repairsmith ever again I hired repairsmith to fix a transmission on my green Chrysler and it never was fixed. I wasted almost $5000 for repairsmith and I've made the worse decision of my life to hire repairsmith to service my vehicle. Repairsmith will never touch ANY of my vehicles in the future. I would like to discuss whoever is in charge so we can talk about getting a refund</text>

Ryan the service technician was professional, punctual, friendly, knowledgeable and proficient.  My Porsche oil change costs $120 minus discount (about half or third of indie Porsche mechanic in town).  Highly recommend for busy people who have no time or interests in taking a car to many mechanics to get a fair quote. Easy card payment. Easy appointment process.  I highly recommend it - and I'm definitely using this company for years to come.</review>

Looking at the reviews I am a little confused because my experience has been less then. I had to make three appointments all of them unsuccessful.
The first appointment I made I received a text the next day saying they could not come out because they were booked. Although their system allows customers to continue to schedule appointments even though they don’t have openings. What is that about?

Weeks later I schedule another appointment, again the appointment was confirmed, and like before I received a text message this time at the end of the day, stating they could not make that appointment because there was a double booking and the slot time was given to someone else.
That same person rescheduled me for two days later.. we agreed and it was confirmed again. When the appointment time came around no one had shown up no one had given  me a call. I text the mechanic to see what was going on no response. I ended up calling customer service and what I got from them was a BS of an excuse and apology. The representative Jeff I believe, told me that the mechanic text me and said he was running late, he doesn’t know why I did not receive the text and maybe there’s a glitch in their computer system. Then I asked him for an estimated time as to when the mechanic will arrive.. 2 hours after the original time.

The fact is there was no communication from the mechanic. I had to text and call to get an understanding as to why no one had shown up and I did not get a good explanation. Unacceptable! This was a complete waste of my time I had other obligations, I had to clear my schedule three times because of this. No regards for the customers time and money.<//review>

{'time': 1602688640090, 'text': 'Tracey, first let me apologize for any misinformation you might have received.  I too wanted to make sure that we did not give you bad info so I called the Honda dealer nearest me (Weir Canyon Honda).  I spoke with Service and asked them about the six mounts Chris recommended. They consisted of the following:  Engine Torque Rod Lower, Engine Torque Rod Upper, Front Engine Mount, Passenger Side Engine Mount, Rear Engine Mount, and Transmission Mount.  Since I too am not a mechanic, I asked if the Transmission Mount was considered an engine mount, making it a total of six on your vehicle and he told me "yes".  This is why Chris suggested we replace all six.  As a mobile service we come ready to do them all, if the Tech gets on site and discovers you don\'t need all six replaced, we (like the Boy Scouts) are prepared, not only with the part and appropriate time on the schedule, but you know the worst case scenario price was as well.  I believe Chris had the best of intentions, perhaps he could have explained it more thoroughly, and I will have a conversation with him to make sure in the future we lay it out more clearly.  However; your vehicle does indeed have six separate engine mounts as you see listed above, we depend on return business so I took this very seriously when you complained and looked into it myself, I have a zero tolerance for lying or suggesting that our customers need something they do not.  -Debbie Sr. Manager of Customer Operations.'}</resp>

I am very disappointed in this company. I have used repair Smith in the past and been very pleased with the mechanic and the service. I went to the dealership and found out that I had a right collapsed engine mount. at the time I thought okay it's a little expensive at the dealership and I would wait. In the meantime I also needed my valve gasket replaced so I called repair Smith set an appointment and had them come replace it at the same time he was here I had him check that engine mount he verified that the engine mount that's near the oil pan on my car had failed and I needed a new one . The cost for one engine mount on my car was $149 per repair Smith great price. I called the schedule service of the engine mount and also wanted to see how much it would cost to get all four of them replaced if a need be why they were doing them $597 total for all four of them to be replaced great deal so I scheduled the service. About an hour or so after hanging up the phone I received a call from Chris the supervisor repair Smith he gave me a call to let me know that my car which is a 2008 Honda Civic LX coupe has 6 engine mounts, he explained that he's very familiar with the problem that I was having because my car was vibrating a lot at idle and also was a little wobbly at times. He told me he would do the best to get me a great deal on all six but he feels that I should do all six at once that they don't feel comfortable doing one engine mount replacement when the others could be bad as well. I told him that's a little too much money for me and I only thought my car had four mounts he said no two of them are hidden they are not seen with the visible eye so being as though he is a supervisor and repair Smith and a mechanic I believe him plus I like the company I trust them, so he proceeds to give me a quote of $1,250 total we schedule the service because it's dangerous for me to drive like that and this is my only vehicle for me my daughter and my husband me and my husband are both essential workers we need our car and God forbid I don't want to hurt anybody out there or ourselves driving on bad mounts. I went to bed that night feeling kind of weird about the situation I felt that was too much and why would I leave be told that there are 4 mounts when theres 6? I called 3 dealerships for Honda and asked  the service managers how many mounts are on my car both of them said only 4, and there's never been a Honda built with 6 mounts,  I was astonished, disappointed and felt hurt that I was betrayed or lied to how much more money is Repairsmith going to make off those 2 extra mounts that they added on to my car that don't even exist? With that being said now I have to find another mechanic that will work on my car in a short period of time because I need it done but that's just honesty and it's wrong so I had to put this review.Now update I have had my car serviced by a licensed mechanic of 35 years and he verified with me that I only have 4 mounts. Engine tork rods as you call them are not TECHNICALLY MOUNTS! depends on the mechanic. Just for future reference like I said before I talked to 3 mechanics at dealerships they all said 4 . Unless you count rods. But the car was only made with 4 mounts on my vehicle. I only needed 2 the right front mount and the transmission mount. Cost $ 778.97.</text>

My car died I thought it was a battery issue, I called repairsmith and they came out same day. The mechanic was a little late outside of the quoted 1hr window but I was at home so it's not a big deal. The mechanic was great I needed my alternator and fan belts replaced, which I was quoted then he had to go pick up the parts. The mechanic worked way past sundown to ensure the issue was fixed and was so pleasant the entire time. I highly recommend. So much better than going to the shop and waiting.</review>

<Text>My car was smoking because of over oiled (badly). So I contact possible repair place on Yelp and RepairS with response asap and asked to come check my car out The Next Day! Memorial Day! (some repair shop was closed). The gave me quote for the overall check.
And Byan was the guy who came to fix my car. He drove here on time, contact me with phone calls and text where he was and when exactly he will arrive (to not making you worry that he is not coming). He is humble, and friendly. He loved his job, definitely know what he is doing and just want to help. He gave me the details of what is wrong with my car, whatever else I have question about he would check and give my advise. Tell me what they can and can't do (Not over charge for nothing).
He gave me told me the prices and explain thoroughly why. Then he scheduled to come back ON SUNDAY, 8AM! (like as if they will be there anytime you need) and TAADAA~, car back to 100%.
There is 12 month guaranty, if my car still have problem, he will come back for it!
I wouldn't say the service is fast or anything because the car need times to get take care of, but he was on time and everything just get done with no concern.

Big Thanks to Byan and RepairS with!<//Text>< pictures>

RepairSmith saves the day! I experienced a total loss of power steering on my Audi just a few hundred yards from my home - the car was no longer driveable. RepairSmith came by to my house the next day to diagnose the problem and identified a hole in the power steering hose and all of the hydraulic fluid had drained. Given the severity of the issue, the RepairSmith technician said that they needed to take my car offsite to fix the issue. They arranged a full concierge service for me, including having my car towed on a flatbed truck, taken offsite to get repaired, and returned to me good as new. It was a completely seamless experience end-to-end. The technicians were extremely knowledgeable and kind, there was constant communication and updates along the way, and the prices were way better than I could get anywhere else, not to mention it was extremely convenient top-to-bottom. I'm fully sold on RepairSmith and will be using it for all of my car maintenance and repair needs moving forward. Thanks for saving the day RepairSmith!!!< /Text>

<review>I am a new RepairSmith customer. A customer rep named "Kim" scheduled my appointment. She was professional yet made me feel at ease because I had reservations about this new type of Auto service. On the day of service, a mechanic named "Joey" called to notify me he was on his way. He arrived on schedule and serviced my car in a timely manner. Additionally, he found that one of my tires had a screw embedded in it, which required immediate attention to prevent a flat. I loved the convenience of getting my car serviced at my residence because I was able to complete my household chores during the time Joey worked on my van. I imagine this service would be ideal for mothers with young children and well as the elderly or infirm because of the convenience of not having to leave home. I loved the service I received from RepairSmith because I did not have to leave home, my repairs were completed in a timely manner, there was no mess in my driveway, Kim and Joey were both professional in manner and performance, and best of all: the cost was the same, if not better, than going to a auto repair shop. I highly recommend RepairSmith to everyone.</review>< GmapID>

RepairSmith was great!  I had my kids with me and didn’t want to go all the way to a shop.  They showed up at my house and by the time my daughter’s nap was over... I had new break pads!</Review>

Got a check engine light, and didn't have time to take my car to the dealer on the other side of Los Angeles.  Gave RepairSmith a call, and they sent a mechanic to my office in Venice to diagnose the problem.  It turned out that my oxygen sensor was broken.  They asked if they could take the car to their shop to fix it, and they returned it completely fixed before it was time to go home.

Thanks!  Super convenient, and I didn't even need to Uber around West LA to get my car repaired.<//review>

I used them last Friday to have a broken brake light fixed. They replaced the full right rear brake light with a brand new one while I was at the office. In addition they topped off my fluids and replaced 4 light bulbs (two up front and two in the trunk/license plate area). Incredibly easy and transparent process. Very easy and friendly to communicate with. Would highly recommend if you are busy and hate dropping your car off at the dealership or a repair shop.< /Review>

The brakes on my Infiniti QX30 were squeaking and with work I didn't have time to take it in, so decided to go with RepairSmith (a friend recommendation). I was able to quickly schedule a time and they came to my office in Torrance. I just handed them the keys and went back to work. I got a text when it was done and came down. Highly recommend this new way of servicing your car!! I really LOVED the fact that their mechanics are actual full-time employees at RepairSmith.</text>

My car started making a rumbling sound when I was dropping the kids off at school in Redondo Beach and the check engine light came on.  I called South Bay Lexus in Torrance and they didn't have availability until later in the week.  Found RepairSmith on Facebook and was able to get one of their mobile mechanics to come out the next day.  I had never heard of a mobile mechanic, so I was a little skeptical, but they showed up in a legit Sprinter Van, kept me informed with text messages the whole time, and replaced the spark plug on my car.  I was so impressed, I had them do the brakes on my other car.  This is the future of car repair!< /text>

After almost 2 hours waiting for their quote I confirmed my appointment (as well as my phone number and email).  I received a message saying, “thank you for confirming your appointment.”

Under “what happens next“ they said their mechanic would meet me at my house at the agreed-upon time.  The time came and went.  After an hour I called and was told that I inquired about a repair but did not make appointment, despite their website posting my appointment date and time.  I was never given an apology or an explanation of what happened.

The concept of someone repairing your car at home is a good one.  But if you use THIS business make sure that you double/triple check that someone is actually going to come or you risk taking time off work and wasting your day for nothing like I did!</Text>

<Review>This is my favorite coffee house in Koreatown! They use Stumptown Coffee. They make Pistachio Lattes, Rose Lattes, and they even have a ‘Brad Pitt’ on the menu haha. Amazing service and the staff is so so kind. They have a parking lot that sometimes gets full, but the parking attendant will always find you a spot. They have an inside patio that is a peaceful garden.  I highly recommend this place! Tell them Elle sent you!</Review>< pictures>

Support this local small business! They put so much love and care into everything they make, and I truly hope they succeed through the pandemic. The “Brad Pitt” and pistachio latte are unique drinks that people come far and wide for. I live in Santa Monica now and will still come out of my way for this family run biz. So much better than Starbucks or other luxury coffee chains. Now that outdoor dining is avail, you can sit in their patio w/ fountains & plants. Check it out whenever you’re in KTown, these guys are the best!<//text>

Balcony makes great green tea lattes. They really take them seriously too. If you think you'll get a crummy starchuxxx type of matcha latte here you're dead wrong. The baristas are very professional and care about giving you perfect drinks. They have a small lot but it often is a valet lot.</Text>

I love this place. It feels very homey and the people are so sweet. I come here a lot with my best friend. You can either come and read, study, or hang out with someone, the atmosphere is amazing. The coffee is amazing and I love the little desserts they have.</Text>

I've been coming to Priscilla's since 1989 when they were located a couple doors down. I have always liked their coffee and their service is always friendly. The coffee is dependable, although I seldom order anything but their cappuccino.  My wife loves the cards and kitschy gift store.< /text>

As soon as you walk in your greeted with kind hello the sort of hellos that your sweet grandma gives and the coffee and hot chocolate transports you too the your peaceful place. The back room that looks like a greenhouse and its full of good vibes. If your in Korea town or even in LA its worth it. Don’t waste your time with the same basic starbucks. Come for a new  experience because thats what you’re getting with balcony coffee and tea. Try the Brad Pitt special I may not look like him but at least I can feel like him for a split second.<//text>

<text>Ordered the Coconutea with matcha and oat milk. At first, I thought the coconut flavor was a bit too strong for my taste, but it mellowed out after I drank more. The drink is nice if you like matcha and coconut and something not sweet.I'd be interested in trying their other drinks.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< Date>

This is so chanchara. I didn't notice this gorgeous & soothing caffè e thé until Google maps showed me what I missed. It was raining; I got off the #14 westbound to wait for a #207 or #757(?) going north to Target at Sunset to buy hard to find Talenti cold brew & strawberry hibiscus sorbetti. I stood under the awning-ledge out front the Korean Adult Day Care Center. The enchanting Koreans were trundling out bags & bags of food to deliver; loading them from rolling carts into buses, vans, even cars. Very oxytocin for me : I felt as if I, a pariah all my life (outside my 5 boroughs), belonged to these friendly people. Eventually, a bus that was nearly empty (the previous one had sardine-tin packing) arrived; I rode up to Target. If I had stuck my nose around the corner, down at the Balcony, I would have seen that it was a welcoming refuge from the disaster that is the intersection of Western & Beverly. I apologize deeply to Balcony Coffee and Tea for overlooking them. I urge readers to check out this tiny shangrila on a rambunctious location. Beviamo!< /Text>

<Text>I LOVE IT! We were visiting from Orange County and loved it so much we came twice in a row! The latte art is so cute, and the lattes are sweet and yummy! The staff treated us nicely. The coffee shop is small, but we never had a problem looking for a seat. I wish there was one in the OC!< /Text>< pictures>

The shop itself is a charming space, with an indoor area and a covered pseudo-outdoor area. I've also enjoyed the drinks. The Brad Pitt was a unique sensory experience that I haven't had elsewhere--a sweetened iced coffee topped with hot milk foam. I've also had a great cup of jasmine tea.<//review><username>James Ryan</username>< Gmap_id>

The best coffee literally made with a love for coffee. Ambience is really nice, a solace in the middle of an urban city.< /Review>

I have an unreasonable love for this restaurant.  It's just a local cafe, but soo delicious.  Excellent service, interesting comfort food menu, cozy surroundings, and great coffee.</Review>

Really cute place with an awesome garden / atrium type room in the back that's filled with plants and at least one fountain. Even though it's right on Western, it's super chill and a quiet, still place to work. Only got tea, but it was good, and the staff was really nice... it's definitely one of those "hidden gem" places in terms of atmosphere alone.</text>

Cute spot. Coffee is okay just got a capp - haven't tried anything else though I'm sure it's good based on all the other reviews (on yelp).
This review is more for the owners:
I do think you guys should consider a new sign outside. From the street it looks like a cheap boba spot that should be located in the OC or something - which honestly is a shame since it's pretty cute inside. I will definitely come back though to try something else.

Friendly and accommodating staff!</Text>

It was good . I ordered malai kofta , raita and garlic naan . The kofta was quite soft but the taste was good and the gravy could have been better . The raita was very good and the garlic naan was good but the garlic pieces were a bit less and the dough was a bit heavy but it was good .<//Review>

It's a great place to go work on your laptop,write or just listen to music etc. They have some really good strains of bud,teas,coffee & some snacks. They also have wax and a dab kit.

This cafe is the definition of a hidden gem.

Don't let the location fool you; the ambience is one of the finest of coffee shops in the area. They have a large, open, indoor seating area with couches, outlets, & Wi-Fi. In addition to that, there is a relaxing outdoor patio with a "greenhouse" type atmosphere, complete with plants and water fountains.

The man behind the counter was extremely patient & gladly explained all the options & if they are better iced or hot. The prices are fair and the dishes they serve you on are glass and China. Very attentive to detail here. The wait time was only 5 minutes from order to table for our group of three.

This place is the definition of the words "natural," and "laid-back." I highly recommend the fresh waffle here with homeade cream to die for! Whether you are on the go or need to do some intense studying, you will find this hidden gem to be ideal in every way.</Review>

First time I came here a couple months ago for a Cafe Latte and was quickly impressed in how clean the store was. How friendly the service was to my and my brother. Finally the Lattes themselves were great not including the atmospheric outdoor patio they have. It really takes you away at night when traffic isn’t so loud and the light are on. If you’re looking for a quick drink I would 100% recommend. If you’re looking for an experience I’d really come during the night and give it a chance outside<//review>

I ended up sitting here for a while just enjoying the ambiance and my coffee while making plans on what to do next. Definitely come here if you love/ are serious about your coffee!</Text>< pics>

<text>Casual, local coffee spot. Plenty of seats available on a Tuesday around 5pm. It's quiet and there's WiFi, though the WiFi wasn't working for the 15 minutes I was trying. I took a work call there and felt a little bad because of the low key vibe, but it wasn't an issue (I tried to keep my voice down!).

Barista is knowledgeable about his prod, helpful, appreciative and courteous. They have an atrium-like outdoor area is relaxing. My fiancee liked the "Brad Pitt"  but I was down with their teas.<//text>

Cute and modernized coffee shop on Polk street.  I really enjoyed the seasonal latte that I got.  It was also quite busy so seating was limited.  I thought it was neat that they had an upstairs with a top window.  Coffee was made really fast (another plus).<//Review>

Balcony Coffee and Tea coffee shop.  I ordered a regular coffee and a glazed donut.  There wasn't anything exceptional about them, but what is nice is how spacious this place is.  Plenty of tables to chat or do work.  Cheaper than other coffee spots in this area.< /review>

The best coffee shop in LA! Although there are plenty of seats and desk, they can get quite crowded during busy days. However, i always find a place to sit. They close pretty late at 11 which i love! I always get the Homemade Vanilla and it's delicious! I could spend a whole day here which i am sure i got close to... Love it!</text>

<Review>Cute hole in the wall coffee shop. Was pretty packed! The drinks are very unique and the service was good! We got the coconut vanilla latte and the red velvet latte. The flavors were really strong and tasted delicious, but they were lukewarm :/ would have been a lot better if they were hotter.<//Review>< Pictures>

This is the best coffee in the city and I think one of the best in the country. But you have to catch them when the pour over bar is open. Their selection of coffees tor pour over is large with most of them being better than the best options in other places in the city.< /Text>

I really love the decor and the feel of this shop. It's quiet and relaxing. The drinks are brought out to you and you drink in shop.
My friend and I ordered the iced mocha, it came with a small silver pitcher, it's a sugar syrup so you can sweeten your drink to your liking. Cute concept but the drink was powdery.< /text>

Aside from the most gourmet hot cocoa I have ever consumed here, there is also quite a lovely vibe in addition to lovely natural lighting throughout. A must for any "grab a coffee" meet ups with others. Business, casual, or otherwise. Cheers!</Text>

Love the atmosphere here both at night and during the day as well.
The owner of this place is really nice and his recommendations are amazing!
Staff here are friendly as well.
Most of all, their coffee is excellent.
My favorites are Brad Pitt and Angelina .
Would recommend Brad when you want to drink drink coffee .
Would go with Angelina if you want something not too heavy.
Also love how its free parking ! That's always a plus!</text>

This place can be tricky to find. At first i didn't realize they had a shop and assumed it was just a coffee cart outside. I only had a pour over and it is probably the best pour over i ever had. My friend who is not even a fan of coffee loved it. It was not to light, burnt, sour, but a perfectly balanced cup of coffee.</Review>

Get the tesoro.  Best coffee I've ever had.  Everything else just tastes bad now.  I don't know how coffee can possibly be this good.  Phil spoon fed me and gave me free baklava.  There is a lot of traffic coming in and out (especially at the 18th and Sanchez location), so it's not easy to study without earplugs.  Free wireless is always good.<//Review>

Everything about this coffee shop is perfect. It's kind of hidden just in the outside of the Healy polished tourist Street. This hip coffee shop is vegan friendly. All employees were talkative and sweet, engaging in conversations! It made me feel welcome and at home. The coffee was a soy chai latte, and it was so great. I will definitely be back when I visit the then again.</Text>

In terms of smoothness, this was like drinking water. Haven't had smooth coffee since I was at Vancouver recently. It is on the expensive side ($5) for a 8 oz coffee and takes almost 10 minutes for them to brew, but you're getting quality stuff.

As for the brew experience it was interesting. They have a barista that brews it and the junior watches on as back up. They sample a piece that they brew and if its no good, they'll toss and redo it until its to their standard.

The place itself is really cozy and is a workplace environment. There's parking in the plaza but I can't imagine during peak hours it'll be easy to find. I been going here near closing time and I'm usually the only one in there.

But definitely come here for really smooth coffee.< /Review>< Pics>

I absolutely love this cafe! I was in the area to check out another cafe called LaB Coffee, but I was unimpressed with their menu. I stumbled upon Balcony on my yelp search and immediately came here after looking through the pictures and reviews.

Their menu offers a variety of flavored lattes, but I was most intrigued by one of their signature drinks - the Brad Pitt. One of the workers (who seemed to be the owner) was so helpful in giving me a breakdown of all of the different lattes. He recommended the Brad Pitt as it was their most popular drink. I was a bit indecisive because I was in the mood for a sweet latte, but he advised me that he could adjust the sweetness of the Brad Pitt and make it sweeter than usual. I am so happy I took his recommendation because the drink was so delicious! I was advised to not use a straw for this particular drink since you are supposed to experience the taste of the foam with the coffee. I loved how smooth the flavor was and it perfectly satisfied my sweet craving. It's definitely a unique taste that you can't get anywhere else!

My friend got their tiramisu latte (iced) and that was also excellent. She was given a spoon to eat the tiramisu topping and then advised to mix it afterwards. I got a taste of the topping as well as the mixed combination and both were great! I really like the flavor of the tiramisu and how well it blends with the espresso.

The exceptional customer service was the cherry on top that made this an A+ experience. The guy who recommended the Brad Pitt told me to bring it back if I didn't like it and he would remake it. He even checked up on me (TWICE actually, because I was too busy taking pictures the first time to actually try the drink) to make sure that I was completely satisfied. It's clear that he genuinely cares about his customers!!

I can't wait to come back again to try all of their other drinks, especially the "Angelina" - described as an iced espresso drink. Thank you again, Balcony, for such a wonderful experience!< /Review>

<text>This is a fabulous little spot in Koreatown serving an assortment of coffees, "coffee-adjacent" drinks (various lattes, mocha and different specialty drinks) and teas, supplemented with a small assortment of pastries and light food items. They take great care in the crafting of each drink, and there's a carefully curated vibe to the whole environment. It's extremely clean and tastefully decorated in an understated way, and typically there's relaxing jazz music playing. In the enclosed outdoor patio, water flows to help soothe customers against the sound of the traffic outside from the busy Beverly-Western intersection. Yes, they also have wifi (which is usually pretty solid), a goodly number of outlets and a certain amount of free parking in the little mini-mall in which they reside, but the thing that sets Balcony apart is the quality of service. Not only is the staff extremely welcoming--they greet and say goodbye to every customer--but there's just a higher standard here than at any other coffee shop I've visited. For example, they bring your drink to you (and if you become more regular, remember your preferences), clean the restroom regularly, and as soon as a customer leaves, they wipe off the table. They just "get it" here, which is why I come so often; I know I'll have a great experience.< /text>< pictures>

This is very close to where I live. I ordered a latte to go but still picked up on the elegant yet relaxing atmosphere/vibe. The coffee was great and the service was friendly. Beats any of the chains any day, for sure!< /review>

It was a brief stop but a sudden one. The location of Balcony is like an Easter Egg but it was amazing. My girlfriend had the Matcha Green Tea Latte and I had their Nitro Cold Brew. We needed to use their restroom, explaining the sudden stop. It has a wonderful ambiance, is super cozy, but most importantly, is spotless. The staff was beyond kind and the drinks were amazing. Definitely recommend this place.
See you soon!<//Review>

<text>Started day with Balcony Coffee and Tea. It was my first time going to the cafe. Took a friend who got the hot chocolate and didn't like it because it was too bitter. I got an almond milk latte which was what it was suppose to be. I really liked the inside decorum.< /text>< response>

Came recently and their coffee was exceedingly excellent and the food was great too! It's a peaceful place where everyone just kind of does there own thing and stays to the selves! The staff was great and my only negative is maybe it's a bit overpriced, nonetheless it's a great place!< /text>

I am a coffee freak. I have to be honest, you can miss this place and pass right by it. By far some of the best coffee I have had if not the best in CA . Worth every cent. Staff is friendly too. They grind, brew and prepare the coffee as you order. Really good coffee.< /Text>

One word: CRAGEL! Being from Miami, we had never even heard of a cragel - but this is for sure the thing to order. The sausage, egg and cheddar cheese is the way to go! Also, be sure to order the chai tea latte - you will not be disappointed!</text>

<Date>1596383453317</Date><rate>5<//rate><review>This location is my go to spot when in San Diego. I've tried multiple barbers here and the best one is Kevin. He's a busy person so you have to make an appointment. He pays attention to detail, super friendly, and is quick. He pays attention to the "corners" of the back of the head and gets a very clean shave at the back of the neck and the corners of the lower neck. I highly recommend him. FYI: digital payment is accepted.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>KEVIN at Fancy Salon
.IS..THE...
BEST! 🙌 hands down! I have been doing my hair w Kevin for over 14 years! I show him a picture of what I want and he gets it done! I wouldn't trust anyone else w my hair EVER! He is quick but very meticulous w his craft!!! When people compliment my locks, I always refer them to Kevin and always will!! He is a fantastic colorist, stylist and person! He always has a great attitude and knowledge of how to maintain a healthy head of colored hair😄👩💇‍♀️<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Introduced to this place by a friend and been going there since - 8 years.
Kevin is the only one that can cut my hair and knows how I like.  Can't go to another shop.  If he is on vacation, I wait until he is back.</Review>< pictures>

<text>I came to Mr. Soleimani based on a friend’s referral. Mr. Soleimani and his team were incredible with handling my ticket. In my case the police officer was attempting to increase the penalty from 1 point to 2 out of spite for my interaction with him at the scene when getting the ticket. This increase n points would suspend my driving privileges and was arbitrary in nature. The officer would not budge no matter how kindly Mr. Soleimani argued so Mr. Soleimani took the case to the Judge and basically wiped the floor with the biased officer. Not only did he get the judge to disregard the officers request for an increase in penalties and point Mr. Soleimani got the court to DISMISS my ticket based on the officers poor behavior!  Mr. Soleimani is a true advocate and and true warrior for justice.

Thank you Mr. Soleimani for fighting for justice and for not just giving up when the fighting gets hard. God Bless you.</text><Resp>{'time': 1608744602596, 'text': 'Thank you for your honest review!!! We always go above and beyond!'}<//Resp>< gmapID>

Amir is the best lawyer I have ever hired, period. He did exactly what he said he was going to do and my 92mph ticket was dismissed,  I’m really blown away. He did an excellent job and he put my mind at ease.  He is not the type of lawyer you need to contact continuously to ask how things are going.  You can really trust him and know that he is on the case and handling it exactly to plan.  If you need constant hand holding and instant results overnight you should probably just pay your ticket.  Amir knows how to do it and your job is to let him do it unhindered with constant inquiries.  For my money he’s one of the best the damn lawyers I’ve ever hired and worth every penny.  Amir offers a top-shelf service.  I can’t thank him enough.</Review>

<review>Really recommend them to anyone who needs to fight a traffic ticket!! They are the best at what they do and I have never been disappointed with them. Amir is SO helpful and easy to work with! He helped me get two speeding tickets taken off my record, and he is always very organized and responsible. He constantly updated me on the status of my tickets and was always very clear with what he told me. My cases all got dismissed! My insurance would have been very high if it wasn't for Amir and all his hard work. I know he has spent lots of hours working on my case and doing everything he can do to help me! I am so appreciative of him and his team. I can't thank you enough and I am so grateful to have found them all!! THANK YOU MR. TICKET!!!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

It was difficult to find a confident attorney willing to fight my case because the violation code entailed a mandatory court appearance, license suspension, points on my license, and a minimum fee of 900$. I expressed to Mr. Soleimanian that I could not have anything on my record due to the type of job that I have... in other words, I could get fired with a traffic violation on my record. I was skeptical at first because no attorney wanted to take my case due to the gravity of it, and because of this, I decided to go directly to Mr. Soleimanian‘s office to meet him. He explained the process and the approximate amount of time I’d wait as he took care of it. He went to my arraignment, went to trial, and not once did I have to step foot in court. Time after, I got a phone call from his office asking me if I wanted my results over the phone or via mail. I asked for them there and then... my case/ticket was completely dismissed. Nothing on my record. SAVED MY NEW JOB. (I work and go to school so I definitely needed my license). The only thing I ever paid for was Mr. Soleimanian’s work, which was WELL WORTH it. THANK YOU, Mr. Soleimanian!!! 😭🙌🏼<//Text></record>

I had 2 speeding ticket with commercial vehicle one on 08/26/17 and one on 12/08/18. Unfortunately I look at all the good reviews and hired them to fight for me. I lost on both cases. Paid fines plus lawyer and I got the point on my record. Oh also I got my driving records and shows DMV got my point on 07/16/19 when I called them on 07/24/19 they said they still fighting. Unprofessional.</text>

Received a speeding ticket in a rural area far from where I lived. Saw that Mr.Ticket was a one time fee no matter how many times they'd have to travel or hours spent on the case.

They took over the case and it lasted 5 months. It went through two trials until it was dismissed for lack of evidence. During that time I received periodic updates and was always informed about the strategies they were using to dismiss my ticket.

Highly recommend this law firm for traffic infractions, will save you money in the long run from the points affecting your insurance.<//Text>

<text>Amir soleimanian saves me and my license and was well worth every single dollar I paid him a little more on the expensive side but the saying is true you pay for what you get. I had a speeding ticket for the fourth time in one year one went away with traffic school so I was on the verge of loosing my license but he saved me. Highly recommended I appreciate the work he has done for me.< /text>< pictures>

< Review>
I contacted Mr. Ticket as they call themselves for a high speed violation. I am satisfied with the services and how they handled the case. I'm not giving them an excellent rating only because they are not that good at keeping you informed throughout the case. I had to call them several times to get someone on the phone who could give me an answer about my case. But in the end, they get the job done pretty well.< /Review>

<Review>My son had a speeding ticket, driving at over 100 miles per hour. We sat with the attorney, who explained to him what driving over 100 means; it is not just a ticket, but risking his life, other's life, parents’ life, community’s life and so on. He went over many examples of recent teenage car accidents and their tragic ending. He showed my son that the ticket is a blessing in disguise, a wakeup call. For Mr. Solimanian, it was not just getting a ticket off, but saving a family. We changed his car from BMW to Prius, and the attorney was great to get the ticket resolved. He did not resolve a ticket violation but prevented a tragic catastrophe that was in progress. May God bless him.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Review>I hired Amir for two tickets. One of them was an exhibition of speed ticket, and the other was a speeding ticket.

The exhibition of speed ticket they got knocked down to a speeding ticket. I was a little upset because it still showed up on my record, but at least it was knocked down.

For the second round, I was amazed as the Mr. Traffic Ticket team was able to get the violation COMPLETELY DISMISSED. I didn't have much hope here, but I was pleasantly surprised.

Thank YOU Mr. Ticket, and Munee for the help you have given me with my traffic woes. You have earned a repeat customer and I truly appreciate your efforts.

Quality pizza and salad in buffet style. The pizza is not overly greasy and is kept properly warmed. The salad is cool temperature and fresh. Free refills on sodas. Very nice internet allowed me to get work done there and they have a large TV. Small one person bathroom but it's clean and functional. Overall great experience for anyone in the area looking for a bite to eat.<//text>

Great food and service! There was a small line today due to Lent season , but it moved quickly. Just a reminder, if you called in your order, you still have to stand in line. They make your order when you get there.<//text>

<text>Honestly my favorite fish taco place in southern california. I grew up eating here and their tacos are simply the best. All other places I've tried taste too "fake" for a lack of better term, but their tacos are very homely and delicious. 😋</text>< Pics>

First time here, pleasantly surprised. Got take out 2 taco combos- carne asada and el pastor, taquitos and chicken burrito. Be aware it is rated B, but we took our chances. Food was good and service fast.< /text>

Good fish tacos at competitive prices.  Salsa is pretty good too and spicy.  Staff is very friendly.  It's a bit dirty inside.  Seating and parking are limited.  El Taconazo is much better and cleaner.</Review>

<Review>Came here and to be honest it was the worst service ever. Not only was there pitchers disgusting and watered down on the michiladas but the waitresses there are not with the business. Not attentive at all. Asked numerous times for napkins from our waitress and other waitresses and literally until we started getting upset they finally brought some which took over 20 minutes. Like come on I would have brought my own in this case. It wasn't just us that were upset it was another table upset too. Like wow these waitresses must hate their job. Came on Wednesday. If I'm paying im sorry I don't have time for attitude or someone acting like they don't want to be there.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80dd2d3b8bb47031:0x1741a4241dc9c820<//GmapID></record>

Delicious food....made to order. Air conditioned. VERY affordable, bring the neighbors, family & friends. I like the Jamaica Drink, it's refreshing. The atmosphere is NOT fancy...but savor the tastes and smells here...go for the food. Mondays & Wed you get a fish taco for a buck. Can you beat that? NO YOU CAN'T.<//review>

<Review>Good fish tacos at competitive prices.  Salsa is pretty good too and spicy.  Staff is very friendly.  It's a bit dirty inside.  Seating and parking are limited.  El Taconazo is much better and cleaner.< /Review><Rate>4</Rate>< pics>

Really hole-in-wall place.  Not a place to take your date but normally I take it to go.  Their fish taco, shrimp taco, potato taco, machaca plate/burrito, etc..... Too many good items to list.  Food quality is pretty good and price is not bad.  Lots local people come here.  They have been here long time.< /Text>

It's a great place to get fish and shrimp tacos and burritos. But sometimes it depends when you go because sometimes they burn the fried fish and it doesn't taste as good. But when your hungry everything taste good. You should differently try it. I recommend the fish tacos.<//Review>

<Review>Fried fish tacos were soggy. No crunch at all. Got there right after opening and it tasted like the fish had been sitting there for hours.<//Review>< time>

<rate>4<//rate><text>Well if you've been here then you know.  Nothing to brag about but not a place to take your date.    My favorite is taco dorado with shredded beef.... Others are great too. My favorite local place to go either to eat there or to go.< /text></record>

BEST fish taco I have ever had. I am extremely picky with fish tacos but these always hit the spot. You will not be disappointed. If you ever come to Norwalk or are around then visit Señor Baja!</text>

Place always gets my order wrong. 3 times I've asked and paid for bacon on my double bacon cheese burger and even asked to confirm my order before I pay and they assured me that it had bacon. That's the last time I'll be going there.< /Text>

The food here is great and authentic! Fish tacos are to die for. I like to call my order in ahead of time for fast service. If you call in they let you cut the line to pay! Nice perk!< /Text>

I highly recommend this place!
Please try tacos de papa! They are amazing!
The shrimp cocktail had so much shrimp omg!!(i think is the most expensive of the menu, but its worth it)
Very happy with the place and staff. Honeatly didnt expected to be that good. They surprised me. They charge 50 c per refill  and the place seems to need some cleaning. Everything seems old from outside and inside.
I will come back again give it a try.</review>

store is small and so is the parking lot but the home made style mexican food is fairly good.  Mainly a seafood spot but they do offer other protein options for those who don't feel like seafood.  Prices reasonable too.<//text>

<Review>They advertise that they have taco Tuesday deals, which is great because they are expensive here. But, sadly, as you get here and ask what the specials are... You end up just getting their head shook at you.. Not even a verbal answer... Just some employee shaking his head rudely as you ask. False advertisement here, rude service, seating is lacking and the place is small. I won't be returning..  Which is sad because their menu, as expensive as it is, sounded pretty interesting.<//Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

Authentic Mexican restaurant. Cheap greasy food. Lots of flies. A matter of time before that "A" sign is off the door. I tried the fish taco plate. Couldn't take the second bite.</text>

Food is good, but the place is a DUMP. With Taco Nazo down the street I dont know how they stay in business. Especially at $2.20 for a tiny little taco.</Review>

<Review>They have the BEST SHRIMP TACOS. The flavor of the shrimp blends well with the crema which is also fantastic.  Thursdays are  the discounted days.< /Review><date>1497233073809< /date>< name>

My company goes to this place just about every Wednesday and today we got a bad batch of Fish Tacos. Couple of my coworkers ate the fish taco and immediately became ill. We went back to get a refund or another entree. The manager there gave a big fuse and refused to give us a refund. We asked for a different entree and that too he complained about. I guess being a regular doesn't matter to him. I don't plan to go there any more.<//review>

I had shrimp & fish ceviche, it was great! Huge portions, I was full after one but couldn't  resist and had some of the second tostada. My husband had the fish tacos and he loved them, he did say that he would request extra crispy next time.  The kids liked the quesadillas with beans and rice. Came here on Friday at 5ish, it was kind of empty.. Will definitely come again!</review>

<Text>People often come up to me on the street & you know what they tell me?

"Hey Rodney, nice ass!"  No.

"Hey Rodney, how much?"  No.  Okay, sometimes.......;p

No, people say to me "Hey Rodney, why are you so happy?", to which I reply "I just got some hot tongue action, that's why!"

Senor Baja hit me debajo de cinturon, "below the belt", with the portion-size of their lengua burrito.
A hefty tongue burrito, with rice, beans, onions, cilantro and other goodies.  Only things missing were some guacamole & sour cream.  Otherwise, a fine filling meal for $5.99 plus tax.

Senor Baja is a closet Sauce Nazi, as they are stingy with their chili sauces.  They only give you 2 containers to put their chili in if you're ordering to-go.

Various specials are offered throughout the week, such as $1 fish tacos/Mon & Wed.

Ample booth seating, with banda music for your listening pleasure.  Parking is in private lots on both sides of the restaurant.  Senor Baja is an unpretentious, hole in the wall taqueria.  So, don't come in expecting ambiance for your first date.  You probably won't get a second one ;p

As for my lengua burrito, I enjoyed it.  The burrito was filling, didn't hurt the wallet and was a healthier choice than buying a McRib at McDonald's.  I'm purposefully avoiding it at all costs.  I used to love McRibs, but knowing all the unhealthy junk that's put in it, I'll pass.

I'll be back on a future Mon or Wed to try Senor Baja's famed fish tacos.  Also, their shrimp cocktail for $10+ definitely piqued my interest.

Senor Baja is a closet Sauce Nazi, as they are stingy with their chili sauces.  They only give you 2 containers to put their chili in if you're ordering to-go.

Various specials are offered throughout the week, such as $1 fish tacos/Mon & Wed.

Ample booth seating, with banda music for your listening pleasure.  Parking is in private lots on both sides of the restaurant.  Senor Baja is an unpretentious, hole in the wall taqueria.  So, don't come in expecting ambiance for your first date.  You probably won't get a second one ;p

As for my lengua burrito, I enjoyed it.  The burrito was filling, didn't hurt the wallet and was a healthier choice than buying a McRib at McDonald's.  I'm purposefully avoiding it at all costs.  I used to love McRibs, but knowing all the unhealthy junk that's put in it, I'll pass.

I'll be back on a future Mon or Wed to try Senor Baja's famed fish tacos.  Also, their shrimp cocktail for $10+ definitely piqued my interest.

The attention a bit unpleasant, they need to be more helpful because in the end you are paying for a service, I give it this rating because the fish tacos are wonderful, one of the few places where you can find something of this style at a price accessible.
Only the detail of the attention would improve.

(Original)
Ricos tacos
La atención un poco desagradable, les hace falta ser mas serviciales pues al final estas pagando por un servicio, le doy esta calificación porque los tacos de pezcado son una maravilla, de los pocos lugares en los que puedes encontrar algo de este estilo a un precio accesible.
Solo el detalle de la atención mejoraria.<//review>< Pictures>
