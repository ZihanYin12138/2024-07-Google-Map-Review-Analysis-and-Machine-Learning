A-1 trucking school name says it all. If your looking to get your class “A” You came to the right place. The instructor’s Rogar sir simian sir bop sir and two masters are incredible at what they do. They take the time to teach you everything till you get it right. Mr.rogar and Mr.simran both Great persons and pushes you to do your best so you could pass. This is the best trucking schooling. Definitely recommend. Worth every penny!< /Review>

Very Very Very Good School. I have no word to express . First few days it seems tough but than help of instructors it seems all easy. When you join school don’t rush. Roger is very good he stays on top of everything. There was a lot of student and everybody was passing in approximately 10 to 20 Days.

There was a lot of students from other school. when they can’t pass their test at other school than they come to A1 Truck School Fresno.< /review>

<Review>YES! I am so happy with A-1 trucking school! Roger was so courteous and respectful to me. He made sure I got practice and was so patient with teaching me skills. He got me licensed and on the road extremely fast and was reasonable with fees. I started with a different school and they were expensive and didn’t formally teach me how to drive a truck. Don’t waste your time and money like me- go straight to A-1!<//Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I came from other school. In my last school I spent 30 days, but at A1 I only spent 12 days and I got my CDL. Other school lure me with low fee but it wasn't worth. At A1 training was good. Don't waste money at cheap schools.< /Review><rating>5<//rating>< Resp>

I came all the way  from  Rancho Cucamonga to get my license. It took me 3 weeks to pass my school. When I went to A-1 Truck school it look like unorganized, but after couple days I start to enjoyed learning, after that time went by so fast. A-1 Truck school  people work real hard with their student. Thanks to A1.<//text>

I am from Reno Nv. Friend of mine recommended me to A1 Truck School. He also got his CDL fro A1 Truck School. First when I started things were little bit slow soon as my exam date came closer they had expedited on the training. I got my license in approximately 20 days. I thanks to my friend who recommended me to A1 Truck School. With their training things look a lot easier. If you worried or thinking to start your carrier in trucking this is the best place to  start. Their school looks ok but their training is marvelous.  So don't judge the book by its cover try for your self you will find out. Especially the people with language barrier.<//Text>

I have anoucment to make  I am Officially commercial driver. I have no words for my instructors at A1. They work pretty hard with all the students. When I went to join school it look awkward, i call my friend who refer me to A1. He told me not to quit just stick ro their program and listen to instructors and thats what I exactly did. Them after few days I start enjoy my training. Fees are low training is superfast. People complaint but they have to realize there is very low compare to other schools. Thanks God Thanks A1.</text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>(Translated by Google) All the brothers were taken from the truck's license school by the Sonsiea Veer ji. I'm grateful to A1 Truck school frsno da who got me the full test and passed it for the first time only. Do not waste money on living and eating habits as well as training and other extra time. I met a lot of boys who had lunched here again in other schools by paying a fee. If you are fast then do not do the work of 10 Dena, then in 20 days the whole karma completed with the permit, I got a sixth license

(Translated by Google) Good school, I was in the first Bakersfield School. Let me tell you, then someone told me to go to Fresno A1 School. I just passed 10 in vice in A1. I also got boys from other schools who were getting worse for 3 3 months. All of us have passed away. We had 20 boys in the group and all passed with Baba's Mehar. Do not spoil your time and your sides and come here straight away. Filling the fees again and again due to the fact that you can get the license here
I can do you tomorrow too

<Review>It was a great breakfast location. Not like a diner, but with a great breakfast burrito and sandwich as well as a variation of other sandwiches. Very delicious. Even the coffee. Freshly brewed from grounded coffee beans. You can choose from different coffees.
A very bargain offer.
We stayed in a hotel nearby and went their day by day. The owner were helpful and very friendly.
Absolutely recommendable.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBeOYX-sM9RWPPVQ6orTr99LZBdolz8Yipk8HF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1531693899644, 'text': 'Thank You Robby, We Appreciate Your Business!'}< /Resp><gmap_id>0x808f79d05e2f9d09:0xb89be320855e2aac</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I can't believe I'd never tried one of their sandwiches, after living in San Bruno for this long. I ordered a Roast Turkey with fixings on a sourdough roll. First of all, the sandwich was huge, enough for two meals, or to share. The bread was fresh. The sandwich was delicious! Grand Leader will definitely be my place from now on to buy deli sandwiches, etc. Thank you!<//Text></record>

Whether it's to take your food to go or to kickback on a Sunday afternoon have lunch and watch the football game on TV his is the place. His sandwiches are delicious and out of this world. Mike is a big warm happy friendly guy who's always willing to please his customers especially his regulars. Take for instance I've gone in there a couple of times and wanted a particular ale or brand of cigarettes that he didn't carry. He told me no problem next time you come in I'll have it for you. And sure enough the next time I went in to the store he had it. That assuredly in a man who aims to please and satisfy his customers and do what it takes to keep them coming back. Service with a smile that's Mike for ya. Thanks Mike your best and so are your sandwiches !!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<review>This is an amazing Deli! The roasted turkey is phenomenal but my personal favorite is there meatball sandwich hollowed-out soft roll or sourdough with fresh meatballs provolone and sauce. You can easily eat it in the car as it has no Cuts in it so all the sauce stays inside like a big sandwich pocket it's toasted. Take time to go get the sandwich</review>< Pictures>

Best sandwiches in San Bruno, with choices of hot or cold and a multitude of toppings. The sandwiches are delicious and remind me of Roxies' in SF. Located in the heart of Downtown San Bruno, Grand Leader has been a staple of the community. The owner Mike is a great guy and always has the best craft beers around. If you want fresh coffee go no further as Mike and staff make the best coffee by the cup.<//text>

<Review>You want a great sandwich when you're slummin' it in Bruno?  Go see Mike and the crew for some of the best damn sandwiches around.  Need a cup of Joe? The pour over coffee is so good you will puke next time you are forced to drink Starbucks. Mike will even make you an $18 sandwich that has so much meat, PETA will put you on their most wanted list. Get in the Leader and get a sandwich.< /Review>< Pictures>

I wondered where they got the beautiful big home style cuts of turkey for their sandwiches. Turns out they cook all their meats fresh in house. Great deli, friendly staff.< /review>

This place RULES. Seriously good sandwiches (my turkey was sliced fresh on the deli slicer) with an amazing garlic spread, an assortment of chips and snacks to enjoy it with, an an impressive selection of beers and spirits. I wish we had more bodega-like places like this in the bay area.< /review>

<review>A great place to get your nails and pedicures done!  It’s a super clean! The girls are really nice.  And they know what they are doing.  Today I had Mindy super sweet.

Got my eyebrows done during around December 10th 2020 and have gone too this place for the past 5 years and never had an issue with my eyebrows! But this time the lady was in way to much of a hurry and total thinned them out, over plucked and waxed them, they look terrible and completely different! ones literally thinner then the other she took about 5 minutes if that, didn’t use any lotion or anything (which normal they do to help with redness)just waxed plucked and said that was it I can only hope they grow back they way they where! I will never return again after this time. Please don’t risk botching your eyebrows here<//Review>

Mindy  does EXCELLENT  WORK  and is quick and so efficient.  My nails are always done to PERFECTION!! The shop is so clean and up to all of the  Covid-19 Code Requirements . They take your temperature when you walk in.  There are plexiglass  dividers  at every  work station  and everything  is sterile.  There is hand sanitizer everywhere  and cleaning supplies  to clean after each client. It is a very safe environment to come and get pampered.   Finally my nails and feet are beautiful again. I highly recommend this shop.</Text><user_name>Judi Westfall-Pellicano< /user_name>< gmapID>

I love VIP bar I get my nails done there by the manager and she's terrific the entire staff is very friendly very helpful the prices are pretty comprable to other places and it's suggested that you make an appointment but you can always walk in and you don't have to wait very long at all.<//Text>

Very unwelcoming! I’ve been looking for a new nail place closer to home... Came in for a fill and color change, was not greeted or acknowledged by the blonde woman standing behind the counter when I walked in. When she did talk to me I asked if there was time to do the services I needed,  she hesitated and gave off the vibe she was uninterested in getting me in she spoke maybe 3 words to me. Clearly if there was not time I understand but there was not mention of availability or wait time. Communication is key and maybe she can do better as to not  alienate future  patrons.< /text>

They always do a great job..I've been coming here for  3 years no...sometimes the massage and the scrub isn't the best but my feet always look better and feel better.....4 star because I feel the European spa isn't really what they say it is.<//Review>

<Date>1518198250553<//Date><rating>2<//rating><review>I went to Victoria nails for years and never had a problem, never broke a nail. I loved it! Ever since the lady that works the front counter with blonde hair took over I have not been able to get in to get my nails done. I went one time and she told me 10 minutes, after 20 I asked when they would be able to start my nails and she said 15 more at least. I told her I had to leave for work and she proceeded to scold me for not making an appointment. After 2 months trying new places I called Victoria for an appt. The lady answered the phone and was so rude, told me no-one can do your nails at that time. Did not offer another appt or bother asking any questions or try to extend service in any way. Apparently they are busy enough to not need my business. There is another nail shop out there and I will find it! Customer service is everything! I wish people would get that!<//review>< pics>

I go because it is the only place close to my home that is the best of others in Yucaipa.   Mike is awesome but so busy it is hard to get in to see him.  I had a couple bad experiences.  One was blood from my nail because she was too forceful.  Another was a schedule error.  People make mistakes but how they handled the schedule error was not professional.  I just felt they were young and dang millennials think so different.  lol......I'm 46...OLD  :)< /text>

called Monday for a acrylic fill appointment after basically all other nail salons being closed on Memorial Day. There was one man working and he told me to come back at 6pm. I arrived and he was still working on someone so I waited until 6:45pm. Not a big deal. Finally it was my turn and very rudely he told me to pick a color, I told him I wanted a light pink color. I also told him I wanted plan acrylic fill and a paint polish on top of the acrylic. I work at a hospital and gel, poly gel, dip powder all reacts with the chemicals and comes off.

He argued with me telling me he couldn't and questioning what I wanted. I finally told him I just wanted my nails done, I told him I wanted glitter at the tips and he also ignored what I wanted.
Every time I asked him a question he ignored it like I was an inconvenience and he wanted to go home. Ag this point I was irritated and decided I would do my own glitter and file at home.

He did not file my nails and did a poor job,
When he was done he asked if I would pay cash or card, I told him card. I also told him I needed to wait a few minutes for my nails to dry before I reached in my pocket and got my bank card. When I go to pay there is a large sign at the counter stating "all tips on cash only" the man takes my bank card and started screaming how much would I like to top because he can add it on. I said sir the sign says tip in cash I can get cash from my car. He asked where my car was and wanted to follow me.

It's amazing! Their facility was built with the sportsman and competition in mind. The grounds are well laid out, modern, and not complicated for a non local.</Review>

two days ago was our first time in this fine restaurant. But It is surely not the last time. We passed a splendid evening with the generous service, with the first-rate  food and booze and with the honest charge. We will absolutely go back there soon.< /review>

I ordered through Postmates and got drunken noodles and yellow coconut curry. Not only did the delivery get here early (!!!), both dishes were AMAZING! I picked medium spicy for the drunken noodles with a side of crunchy pork. Each bite was perfect. I wanted to keep eating after I was full just because it was so good.  My fiance had the coconut curry and he was in love from the first bite.<//text>

food doesn't seem that high quality.  Once the Meal came in melted Styrofoam containers which is a huge no no.  Best thing i've had was the fried wonton appetizer  but specify not to put it in styrofoam.</Review>

Not expensive. I loved: the Mint beef (beef stir fried with medium hot peppers and mint: very tasty; medium hot because I told them I didn’t want it too hot); the bbq pork spare ribs with fried rice; the garlic short ribs (pork short ribs); and on the first time buying the grilled rainbow trout with shrimp fried rice, I loved it even though it was not enough fish to satisfy the fish craving. The second time I bought the rainbow trout with shrimp fried rice though, there were several big problems (and keep in mind these problems were the same in both orders of the rainbow trout dinner that I ordered on this occasion): the meat of the fish was not tender at all, too tough; in the red wine sauce there was no longer any taste of wine, but the first time I ordered the rainbow trout a few weeks earlier, the red wine sauce was fresh and excellent and I could taste the wine a lot; another problem the second time I ordered the rainbow trout dinner was that the fried rice was old and the flavor was poor, very different from how their fried rice was the other times I ate here/from here: those times, their fried rice was very excellent; lastly, the second time I ordered the rainbow trout dinner (and this second order was comprised of two orders), the shrimp were not big, but instead quite smaller, and one out of 4 of the shrimp had a bad taste (4 shrimp counting 2 in each order from this second time buying the rainbow trout dinner). Now for the Honey Duck and the Crispy Duck I ordered two different times: I liked but didn’t love the roast Honey Duck that I tried two times (one of those times was a take-out order), and the Crispy Duck I tried another time was way too crispy: I’m not just talking about the skin of the duck, I mean that All the meat of the duck was so crisped it wasn't like eating meat, but like eating "burned" crisp without the meat; there was very little on it that had meat texture rather than super crisp texture.—Seems like Crispy duck is supposed to be that crispy, but I've had some crispy duck from elsewhere that wasn't so crispy and was more enjoyable. With many plates or with all, you can order their fried rice/shrimp fried rice along with whatever you order, like I did with the bbq pork spare ribs, the rainbow trout and the crispy duck. Their fried rice/shrimp fried rice is the best that I’ve had at any Thai restaurant because it barely seems like the usual fried rice: it's actually better and healthier because it isn't like the usual fried rice, it’s not greasy/oily like the usual fried rice: it’s more like some steamed rice with tomato bullion added like I used to eat as a kid at home. I like lightly tomato-flavored/colored rice. It's not like any fried rice I've had at a Thai place before...because it barely seems like fried rice. The shrimp were good and big enough (there are only two shrimps placed) all of the times that I ordered shrimp fried rice, except for one time that I mentioned above. When I ordered the crispy duck with shrimp fried rice, there were only miniscule bits of egg (but I didn't want more egg that day,so that wasn't a problem), but when I got shrimp fried rice with the rainbow trout, there was a lot of egg. So for the duck, I recommend the roast Honey Duck for sure, not the crispy duck. Their Thai Iced Tea tastes great, but it had a dulling sleepy effect, so take note of that. It was like the opposite of coffee. I'll have to read about Thai tea more before I order it again, though I've had similar elsewhere awhile ago. I like this place, even though they gave me a not-good order of rainbow trout with a hard fish and old shrimp fried rice in two orders that I bought one Saturday April 3rd 2021 about an hour after noon, when you’d think that would be fresh on a weekend order, but everything in that double order was well past its prime.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<Text>Terrible Terrible Terrible,  where is the health department. Just because its covid  going on and everything is closed doesn't mean I should settle for Terrible food. I don't understand why they are still in business. However the fried chicken wonton were amazing but I felt sick to my stomach after I ate them. Please send Gordon Ramsey, stat.

No where near as good as original thai BBQ on 3rd street beef broccoli very hard & dry beef, beef satay hard & over cooked, on 3rd beef melts in your mouth. Garlic short ribs over cooked and dried out. Shrimp fried rice very disappointed sent back half of the food  .I won't be returning to this location ever again. 3rd & Ardmore is the place to go!!!< /text>

<review>I been going to this place for the pass 5 years. The food is great. The waiter is very friendly. The 4 star is because of the parking. Sometimes i have to park a block away. They only have valet parking. Other then that i would had gave them 5 stars.<//review>< time>

Small sides. Hey I'm a girl who appreciate the sides and entree. Anyways the ribs are what I ordered. I loved it the first time. The following times weren't as good. I'd give it another chance if I had a craving to take with me on the way to the beach.<//Text>

Great service, but the pad thai was so salty and I want to say "vinegar-y". The Glendale branch makes it 100 times better!</Review>

Everything tasted like fish, which is fine if you have some kind of seafood in the item ordered. However, most of what we ordered did not have any seafood. The orange chicken was terrible. It was almost completely fried breading only, and really hard like it had been fried a couple of times. We were all really disappointed because our family has been coming here for over a decade, although it has been some time in between, but the food used to be fantastic. I guess the new places that opened in the same shopping center really did affect business.</Text>

<text>I always order from this place, well not always as in every week but when I'm craving thai, especially their rib plate (which can feed 2/3 people, it's 3 ribs on a plate of shrimp fried rice, and side dishes vary on my mood. Overall the food is always delicious and hot. I was just bummed that yesterday the order took over 2 hours to receive. The same instructions are always requested , but I guess the delivery driver did not read the order print out because he couldn't figure out how to get in my building the first time and the second after I called about my late order he called back asking me how to get in the building and the apartment number. When I saw the order print out all that info was printed boldly. Anyways they sent me a fresh hot plate and everything was correct so I can't be mad. Delicious food.< /text>< pictures>

<review>First of all, people that gave this place 5 stars obviously have no idea about food. I have been to many great Thai restaurants and bad Thai restaurants - so far Thai Original BBQ on Western is the worst. I ordered bbq pork spare rib dinner w/ extra shrimp. Everything tasted like it all just came out of microwave - rice was dry and tasteless with sour flavor-definitely not fresh; ribs were disgusting, I ate one, the rest were too hard to even bite on - just a total disappointment and waste of $12. The extra shrimp consisted of 2 tiny and 1 small shrimp. Stay away.</review>< rating>

<Text>This place is very near where I live, so when the menu--with coupons--showed up at my house, I was glad to try it. Thai food is very interesting to me but not always the first thing I go for, so I remember this being good--not great--and while the atmosphere is sort of cozy, the service was just okay.< /Text>< Pics>

Order an item two weeks ago in states only for me and to call and contact the company via email twice to finally have them tell me over the phone that the item is out of stock even though it had a shipping label created. If the item wasn’t in stock why do they still advertise it for sale To this day and didn’t compensate me or message me back at all. This is why AMAZON is putting companies like this outta business. See yah. Zero customer service.<//review>

Great products, very competitive prices, facilities don't reflect their quality but great deals. Found them on eBay but went to their warehouse to fit the gear on my child. Great purchase.<//text>

These guys are the worse in any kind of sports supply.. The customer service sucks!! They told me 3 days on my order never called me to tell me my order was late and i drove over 40 miles to pick it up. They have very limited expertise in the martial arts supply field.. Their wooden dummies are over priced !! Service and punctuality is the worse I have ever seen !! Very Rude!!! Made me feel like i should of never given them my money!! I dont understand their rude behavior when im trying to spend money in their place of business!! If you are looking for prompt service and reliability of quality products this is not the place for true Martial Artist and people expecting courteous and respectful service !!!</Review>

The quality of the product is excellent...I decided to go direct to the store to see the qaulity of the things I wanted to buy...the only thing I regret..was that I did not price out what I wanted...I bought over $150 worth of merchandise...came home and looked up a couple of things i forgot...I found out that I over paid for all the Items...every item was way lower than the store clerk said..if you buy from them..go prepared...they dont have prices on their items at the store...they just jack up the price...</text>

< review>
These guys are the worse in any kind of sports supply.. The customer service sucks!! They told me 3 days on my order never called me to tell me my order was late and i drove over 40 miles to pick it up. They have very limited expertise in the martial arts supply field.. Their wooden dummies are over priced !! Service and punctuality is the worse I have ever seen !! Very Rude!!! Made me feel like i should of never given them my money!! I dont understand their rude behavior when im trying to spend money in their place of business!! If you are looking for prompt service and reliability of quality products this is not the place for true Martial Artist and people expecting courteous and respectful service !!!<//review>

The quality of the product is excellent...I decided to go direct to the store to see the qaulity of the things I wanted to buy...the only thing I regret..was that I did not price out what I wanted...I bought over $150 worth of merchandise...came home and looked up a couple of things i forgot...I found out that I over paid for all the Items...every item was way lower than the store clerk said..if you buy from them..go prepared...they dont have prices on their items at the store...they just jack up the price...</review>

< review>
I am sad to say that I would not recommend this practice to anyone. I was sent by my PCP to pain management to help me find a solution to change or eliminate the medication I have been on for 3 yrs. The NP I believe Dr Sara treated me like a drug dealer or addict because I take medication for multiple fractures , plates and screws, bulged disks in my back and nerve pain. She cut my medication in half before she even had an MRI , Rudest NP I have ever dealt with. The office staff (Evylyn or Devlyn) laughed at me and told me no when I asked to see the NP again . My prescription was cut in half, I was told “try injections but they probably won’t work until you go 2-3 times “ and when I asked for my regular dose of medication I was laughed at. Very unprofessional and if I ran my business this way I would be out of business. Look for someone else who cares about your quality of life not just protecting themselves !<//review>

<Review>This office does not deserve any stars. After 2 months of back and forth an appointment was made in the Murrieta office because they could not communicate with the Riverside office. The physician refused to keep the appointment because we arrived 5 minutes late. I would have been understanding if there were other patients waiting but no one was there except us. The front office staff was rude and unprofessional. They were whispering within earshot as to who was going to tell us that my mother would not be seen even though she has been in extreme pain the last 2 months. I have nothing positive to say about this place.< /Review>< UserId.>

<Review>Ok first I want to share the negative, in the Murrieta office I had the same experience most have described with the Nurse Practionor, she is very condescending and rude and not very aware of pain and pain management, she treats all patients as if they are drug addicts!  She had an issue with a medication I was taking that was prescribed by another doctor, when I told her on the advice of that doctor I WOULD NOT stop taking it, she stormed out of the room, came back and tossed a papercc Vac at me about opioid meds.  She then set up an appointment for me to consult with Dr Thio.  I was really glad about that! I went and saw him and he agreed with everything I had to say, said he had addressed this issue with her and that she was wrong.  I then asked to be switched to the Riverside office, which is also a lot closer to home!  I just had my first appointment there and it was night and day difference!  This doctor knee pain management, understood my pain and treated me with respect!  So for the Murrieta office I would give 0 stars for the NP, 5 for the staff, and Riverside location I give 5 stars!<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I was referred to Dr. Thio but never even saw him. Instead I had a completely unprofessional
Assistant named Thomas who was only able to tell me they’re bread and butter ( his exact words )  are the injections. No other options were offered or recommended!!
I have an 8 mm spondylosis at the base of my spine, 3 bulging herniated discs and arthritis in my neck.
I left the office in more pain AND high blood pressure
I wouldn’t refer anyone to see these people.
I can’t imagine what they billed my insurance for absolutely no help to me whatsoever!!<//Review>< username>

<Text>My Dr. is absolutely perfect. Staff upfront has no compassion. Very unprofessional and very rude. They need training on how to be nice to patients. How to treat them with repect. There is one staff behind the scenes that is really really bad. Starts arguments and then tells Dr.s that you said things when you really didn't. Terrible!!!
I live my Dr. though. Love love love her!

UPDATE ON MY LAST REVIEW: 1/28/2020
This Dr. Has changed staff around. I don't know if it was bc I complained or if many complained! Everything is perfect here now. Great place. I now give them 5 stars! *****<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Deserves ZERO STARS!

Was referred to Dr Thio to seek treatment options for my multiple systemic chronic pain conditions. I was told that they would only focus on one body part, so I mentioned the degenerative arthritis in my thoracic spine as it was the most prevalent at that time. I was offered facet joint injections only & during the PA's exam (I can only presume that's what she was because I couldn't pick Dr Thio out of a lineup because I never saw him) I kept asking questions that she couldn't answer so she went next door where I could hear her asking a male for the answers (Dr. Thio?) After 3x she sent in someone else who then reviewed facet joint injections with me. When she finally looked at my chart & found that I was 5# over the table limit, that option was taken from me and no treatment options were given at all.  Sent me back to my primary doctor until I lost some weight, yet never sent him an assessment about the visit. During the PA's exam of my spine, she rested her body weight on my shoulder right on a major Fibromyalgia tender point & sent me into a PAIN FLARE for 2 weeks.

I should have listened to my mother's advice not to go because she too received the same negligent treatment when she was (supposed to be) assessed for pain from undiagnosed ascending paralysis & received no treatment or diagnosis as well.

Unless you are completely healthy and going here for a boo boo on your elbow, avoid this hack clinic like the plague.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I have been seeing Dr Thio and his nurses for years after a car accident destroyed my life. I find Dr Thio to go above and beyond every single time I see him, at one point he wanted to ensure I didn't get needless injections so he refunded my copay . Dr Basa was amazing when she managed my care and now Dr Sara Sheikh has managed my care. If you are responsible and interested in a care plan these Doctors bend over backwards. If you show up and expect a pill mill it will not work in your favor.</review>

<Text>the worst Staff ever..never answer the phone if they do your on hold till you hang up and try a call back..Also  3-4 hour lunches every day, must be nice! I want a job like that...if they put you on hold hang up and call back..and keep calling back until they talk to you...lazyist staff I've ever seen! Oh and don't forget to bring Cash Only.. after all, who do you think pays for those 3 hour lunches! and note: if you try and make an appointment by phone..they are supposed to only do that till 4:30pm..But that's a Lie! they'll shut the phone's off all day sometimes...So good luck!

I like the staff and Dr and even the PA and nurses. I have had no proublems with the staff at all.
I had surgery years ago witch did not help. Now with new treatments i have gotten releif from cronic pain.
Dr. T from the get go told me that he only needed to know why i was sent to his office and how could he help. It was great not having to go through all treatments and surgeries of my past that did not help.

I love this pain management clinic and all you have to do is be honest and understanding . treat them like you would want to be treated.<//text>

<Rate>2<//Rate><Review>I was a patient here for a few years. I've waited up 90 minutes in the waiting room at least twice. Still went back. Once the front office manager yelled out as I was leaving in front of several other patients, " Lose all that extra weight and that will help!"  I still went back. Finally a new doctor came in and my regular one left. This low life, uncaring, disrespectful prideful man told me  to "Go somewhere else if you don't like what I'm saying. " Alrighty then. I can tolerate a lot, even my chronic pain, but a doctor like this is not going to ruin my ability to live a decent life. Dr. This is pretty good but this new guy from Florida be needs to go back where he came from.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80dc8239b748eb69:0x18a423b89d5c8848< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The worst experience I’ve ever had at any Drs. office! The only good thing I can say positive about the place is the staff is excellent. Nurse practitioner I saw, I walked out after spending less than 5 minuets with her. Need surgery on neck and lower back, she never reviewed my reports, didn’t bring them in to review with me. Walked in and she stated I was there for my low back which I wasn’t, said she would discuss my neck and not anything else. This was not referring to a procedure, just my first visit there. She said think about it and let me know, said I don’t need to and this was absurd and she literally walked out and SLAMMED the door. Staff was very polite and apologetic, they seemed to be used to her behavior. Horrible.< /text>

These people are HORRIBLE!!!! The most inept, careless, rude, people I have ever dealt with. They have absolutely NO CLUE what people are going through mind and body when dealing with pain treatment. They have ZERO COMPASSION for people. They treat people terribly. Like you are inconveniencing them by asking them to do their job in a timely manner. Just a GROSS organization. I thankfully have a GREAT primary doctor who sent me elsewhere without a question due to the many, many complaints about Ivy Pain Mismanagement... GO ANYWHERE BUT HERE!!!!!!!!!</Review>

Worst medical experience ever! My wife has suffered from MS and Fibromyalgia along with residual affects of multiple knee surgeries. She changed her care provider from Humana to Scan this year and also her medical group in Riverside to one closer to our house in Lake Elsinore. I took her to a new primary care doctor who is very compassionate to her condition and ailments. she has taken pain killers for the last 10 years and tried everything available to reach the point of being able to control spasms and pain with and without  medication. She has had the same prescriptions etc... for years and when we were referred to this place she was treated like a drug addict. This was obvious from the minute they gave her a cup for a urinalysis before anything else. The nurse practitioner was blunt and advocated getting off of the pain meds in favor of cortisone shots. This is only effective for specific muscle and joint pain and has no benefits to her condition which we indicted to her. She went as far as to accuse her of abusing the Norco by going through 155 pills in 5 weeks (her script was for 150). After she said this i knew we were going nowhere with her.  This was after giving her my wife's history and explaining all that she goes through and that she has tried the NP left to call the doctor who then said there was nothing they could do for her. After leaving we called her primary care doctor who will refill her prescription and submit a referral for a different doctor. I have never gone to an initial "doctor" appointment that the doctor doesn't even show up to meet a new patient. This really shows the level of care and compassion at this place.

Bottom line is that in this day and age you are your only advocate. Many medical professionals have become jaded as the business has gone corporate. It is a shame that the opioid crisis in this country was brought on by some of the same professionals that freely prescribed oxycodone and Norco backed by a government that doles them out like candy to disabled vets is now blocking htem from being available to people that cant live without them.

i wouldn't recommend this facility to my worst enemy!!!<//review>

Wife had the RF treatment for her lower back...extreme pain afterwards. Asked for a medication to help combat the pain but was told she had to come into the office for an appointment to get it. Problem is an appointment would be 7 days away so in the mean time my wife would suffer. Incredibly bad patient care due to dumb protocols. I guess they believe all patients are drug addicts.<//review>

Maybe Used Car Sales or Coroner - where she can utilize her skills in a more suited manner... Cold and unfeeling -1 Star is pushing it!!!!</text>

Absolutely and totally the most incapable staff on the face of the planet! You will not be notified of anything you need to bring with you to your first appointment until it's too late to obtain it from your dr the night before your first appointment. Do NOT come to this office for pain management ever! Wether you're within the 15 minute window of arrival time you will be turned away without any compassion. The "nurses" at the front desk are illiterate and can barely speak English despite appearing to be Caucasian and lack even the basic ability for compassion needed for working in the medical profession.< /review>

Terrible experience they made a mistake and scheduled my wife at the wrong office, they refuse to do anything to fix the huge problem that they created. My wife had an open wound for over one year and needs pain medication until the problem is resolved, she is out of medication and these people absolutely couldn't possibly care less!!! We were referred to this place because we have to stay in network for our insurance so we're placed in a bad position by these mistakes they are completely incompetent. They also told us even if we were seen by the doctor there is no guarantee that they would give my wife the medication that she needs, what a joke!!! I highly recommend not wasting your time and go somewhere else at any cost, horrible place!!!< /text>

<text>I arrived early, and had all my required paperwork in order. I waited 2 hours saw the nurse and was denied ANY treatment and I never saw the doctor. The nurse said they only treat one thing at a time even though I was in a near fatal motorcycle accident with multiple open compound fractures. They denied pain medication unless I was getting injections and refused any care. I immediately went to ER. I called the Drs office and asked for my medical records which only annoyed the office staff. I will seek legal advice! Avoid this Dr at all costs< /text>< Date>

<username>Beth Wickham< /username><Review>I had my first appointment with them last month, and didn't seem to horrible, other than like every other doctor around they're cutting back on meds dramatically. The doc told me that he would cut me down slowly over a 2 month period, so whatever. Then I went back today for my 2nd appointment and he starts grilling me on my diagnosis, telling me that NOW he needs notes from multiple doctors saying what's wrong with me. Which wouldn't have bothered me so bad if he would've asked on my first visit! Then he says that he's cutting it even more this month. Um, what happened to taking me down slowly??? Not to mention this guy tells me that fibromyalgia is garbage and he doesn't believe it's a real thing! Guess I'll start looking for a new place, because I'm not sure with as old as he is that he can even be sympathetic or a good doctor!!! Not to mention this place only takes cash!

If I could give a zero star I would. One of the worst experiences I have had at a Dr. office. I have never been to pain management and do not ever plan on going to one again. I should have known from the first visit when they gave me sample meds that were awful. When I called to tell them the Dr. insisted I keep taking them. I mean it's like a bad meal you don't take a bigger bite if the food sucks. So I never filled the prescriptions. I then agreed to have the steroid injections in my thoracic spine on the 3rd round Dr. K hit my lung and sent me home in excruciating pain. I ended up in the hospital for the better part of 5 days. The Dr. himself finally decided to call me after the 5th day thinking that something might really be wrong.  After spending close to a $1,000 dollars out of desperation to be pain free. I am in worse pain now. I had a follow up appt but this office only excepts cash!!! Gee I wonder why! I walked out of there today beyond disappointed.<//review>

about 4 years ago I had to move to murrieta to take care of my father. my old pain mgt dr was great. I needed a pain dr HERE right away or drive 200 miles R.T.
THIS OFFICE WAS ABLE TO SEE ME WITHIN A WEEK. KNOWING HOW PAIN MGT WORKS, I asked what they needed from me before the appointment. They sent me the paperwork and I filled it out. Easy stuff.
now I had been through 2 eppidurals and months of physical therapy. As I told the dr. The only thing proven to work has been was the medication. It took my other dr 6 months to get the dose correct. They took care of me. After a couple of months they suggested facet injections. Hesitantly I did it since my insurance covered it. Unfortunately they did not work. He saw me monthly examined me and was content with the medication. i never called in with excuse for more medication or I lost it. I passed every urin test. I was able to have a quality of life.
then I had to switch insurance because of my job. It was kaiser. for the first 2 years they were great. Filled my prescriptions. I was a poster patient. then out of the blue kaiser said every patient must either be cut off completely or tapered to a dose that is 10% of what I was taking. I am now about 1/2 of what I was getting.
I am basically bedridden. if I get an hour of physical activity daily I'm lucky. I can't walk up stairs in my home getting a hug from my daughter is extremely painful. I am disabled yet kaiser only cared about saving money and only care about the abusers. I was called collateral damage. The millions of us must suffer because a couple thousand decide to abuse the drugs. Addiction and dependency are totally different. And dr Thio Lao and grace know this. Chronic pain is a lifetime disease if not operable. Opioid therapy is the gold standard when taken as directed and the dose is correct for the individual. all patients are different.
For An addict 1 mg of an opioid is too much. I've seen this office deny addicts trying to get medicine. I like that!
If you have a real problem with pain. You have the MRI X-ray Ct scan that shows the problem and you follow all of the rules. This is the office for you. they were always compassionate to me.
I start Medicare in sept. The first thing I did was make an appt with them. I'm dropping kaiser for their lack of compassion as a company. My primary dr at kaiser feels terrible. she wants to continue to medicate me the dosage that works for me but was told to tell me "she'll get fired, go to jail and I will die" This is what kaiser does threaten their doctors if they have treat chronic pain patients.
I have already filled out all the paper work for dr thio, explained how my pain is almost as bad as it was before I saw my first dr regarding my pain.
FOR ALL THE BAD reviews I've read here, I hope this one makes up for it. They are not going to just give you pain relievers without justification, the ladies in the office are very helpful, sweet and kind. When they are very busy it isn't fun dealing with in patients in pain it's even harder dealing with people just seeking drugs To get high. Real pain patients don't get high off the medication, period! They just get pain relief one day at a time. No different then a diabetic needs insulin on a daily basis. It's time the public realized the difference between the two and understood illegal drug use and suicide rates will increase if doctors aren't allowed,to properly medicate their chronic pain patients as needed. The FDA just said no two patients are alike and one person that needs 1500 mg mme is what it is. another patient with the same complaints may only need 200 mg me.
Every bodies tolerance is different and the medications metabolize differently. The CDC guidelines are not a law they are not even a standard of practice. They were put together by insurance companies and doctors that own rehab clinics. The goal to save insurance companies money and create more illegal drug users to fill the beds they own. be grateful clinics like these that Follow the rules exist.
I pray kaiser didn't do too much damage to me

<review>Worse pain clinic I've ever been to. Insists on performing procedures that are not FDA approved and have high complication rates. Even when I told the Dr that I went thru those procedures for 2+ years and became allergic to meds used in them, he said if I don't do the illegal procedures that I won't get my pain meds. The Dr and staff are very rude and incompetent.
Run...run far away from these greedy idiots.<//review>< pics>

It takes a little more meds along with severe arthritis in both hands and wrist as well as both knees is bad. And the pump does not help those areas. Dr Thio will not even try and help relieve any of those pains . So my question is is he really helping to manage his pain. And then to tell my husband he was doing him a favor by seeing him . I do believe the insurance pays him he sure does not do it for free. And today he discnharged my husband because he filed a grievance and would not give him his prescription unless he signed a paper a caring dr I don't think so .

<text>We were seen in this office for over 2 years, a referral from IEHP. When we came in for our monthly appointment today, we were informed that Dr. Thio's contract with IEHP will expire on November 30th and he will not be renewing. We were given a form to sign acknowledging that we were no longer able receive care, given a month's worth of medication and shown the door.

Getting a referral for pain management is a difficult and time-consuming process. I am not confident we will be able to get one and get in to see a new Pain Management doctor in 30 days. My wife will then not only be in chronic excruciating pain, she will also be withdrawing off pain meds.

I can only assume this was a financial decision, but of course cannot be sure as we were merely given our last appointment and shown the door. I hope I am wrong.

Thank you, Dr. Thio, for putting your financial interests ahead of the well-being of your patients. "Do No Harm.... unless you can make a lot more money by signing a contract with another insurance company and kicking a large portion of your patients to the curb."<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc8239b748eb69:0x18a423b89d5c8848</Gmap_id></record>

Hate this place. The office staff are rude and incompetent. They NEVER seem to get paperwork they need for procedures, even though the paperwork is sent a week ahead of time. They lie about it and they hang up on you while trying to get a resolution. Horrible horrible place. Avoid it at all cost. Not sure how they stay in business. Report them to the BBB if you experience problems with these people</review>

The food is good. It's pretty straight forward. Nice hole in the wall, small business. You get a lot of food, for the price you pay. I paid $7.90, for a 2 combo plus a drink. Good for a quick bite. It's easy to pass by, from the main road.< /text>

I came here one sunday morning because it was near where i was going. Ok enough of the small talk. Its good! I now come here almost every Sunday. The portions are BIG...HUGE! Could not believe it. Panda Express comes no where near the portions they serve here. The lady in front is very kind (pretty too :))
Anyways... Beauty talk aside. I like this place!!<//review>

I like cone here for Chinese food, the place is clean and the service is always great, they have a little bit of everything, and when you buy a single serve for your self, the bowl is enough for one person, you can choose between rice or noodles or both on the same bowl. And is inexpensive. 👍< /review>

<Time>1614873322425</Time><rating>1<//rating><Review>I have been a client with H&R Block for more than eight years. This year I called to make an appointment like ever other year. I showed up a few minutes early and did not get seen until an hour later in the meantime there was two employees that could’ve helped me but instead I had to wait. on top of having to wait an hour to get seen my taxes were not filed until a month after I had gone in to file. the only reason my taxes were filed was because I called to see what was going on. I was told that I was going to get a call back and never did right after I made that call I started getting texts saying that my refund was submitted that the IRS had received it. I paid $400 for them to do my taxes and they couldn’t even submit my taxes correctly very upset with H&R Block will not be going back.PS still waiting for a callback<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x809adaaa40ac313b:0x90d7987b47268b43</GmapID></record>

Great store, amazing furniture. Great prices, huge selection. Good quality of merch and best of all incredible finds. my son broke a lid to a crock pot when we were in there I was extremely embarassed and the staff was so kind toward us and we didn't have to replace it. I will make this one of the best good wills I have been too. A cherry oak changing table for only 20 bucks?!! Wow!</Review>

<Review>Just came back from Walnut Creek location.  Their front doors were wide open.  We had 6 bags of clothes, shoes and linens to donate.  It was 20 min before 10:00 and we asked if we could just give them the bags then.  They replied that they had rules and we would have to make another trip back.  Very rude young  woman who just shouted at me that they didn’t open til 10:00.  Would it have been so bad to be polite to people that actually are donating to their cause instead of acting like we were bothering them.  Will NEVER go back to them again

Went down the Street  to St. Vincent de Paul and we’re greeted and thanked for our donation.  Even told to have a good day as we were handed the receipt.  What a great group of people.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

< Review>
A bad experience tonight at the Walnut Creek Goodwill. Clerk's need to learn or be trained to restrain themselves verbally. My only course of action is to leave reviews, warn others and not shop there. I spend $20,000 annually at Goodwill stores to support my business. Respect would go a long way towards maintaining or increasing that number. This store has no male register clerk's; a fact that's NOT gone unnoticed by the regular male clientele.<//Review>

If the prices are going to be higher, it should be tidier in this store.
One aspect that might make this store worth a stop is that they have a bit more furniture than most stores.
There's a decent sized parking lot here.
I always recommend supporting independent thrift stores like The Garret over chains like Goodwill or especially Value Village (currently under investigation in WA state). Donate and buy from small, local charities!<//review>< Pics>

Rude staff. It was my second donation in this week. The first time, I brought two bags of clothes and a new bicycle pump. As I was passing the bags to the male receptionist, he asked me with a bad attitude if the pump worked and giving me a hostile look. Today, I went to donate a wooden table, a TV screen and a mirror. The parking lot was full. I had a very heavy table that I wanted to donate. I pulled up near the door to unload the furniture when the guard yelled at me saying I couldn't park there even for a minute. I felt totally abused and unwelcome by his tone of voice  and left.< /text>

Large thrift store. Staff are present, generally polite but would not consider them friendly. This thrift store sells loads of clothing, books, CDs, dishes, furniture, small appliances, and some plant/gardening things.  Store is a bit grubby so bring some hand sanitize. Dishes and clothing are jam packed in the place to the point that it makes it difficult to shop and pick things up as there are way to many items all stuffed together. Did pick up a couple of items but generally they seem to be a bit overpriced on many of the items. However, not the worst thrift store I have come across and would consider going again.< /review>

<Text>Easy parking, this store is fairly large and organized. I was looking for something specific and didn't find it, ended up not buying anything this time.
The store was pretty quiet and no staff in the store ever said hello; they need to work on their customer service skills a little.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Not bad place for 2nd hand goods. But need better organizing. When I took pictures for review, an woman working here looked at me with strange eyes. Then I asked if I can take pictures for review, she checked with her manager, the answer was NO. Then I showed current 36 photos in Google map for the store to one of their stuff.</text>

<Review>Someone named Mercedes helped me with my purchase and was very attentive and answered all my questions. There were 3 others there, all working very hard as well. This place was clean and has a drop off section inside the front of the store.<//Review><rate>5<//rate><gmapID>0x8085619e3bc14f67:0xd1b192b8cd9121f4</gmapID><date>1536608482350</date></record>

<Review>Nice big store. Probably one of the biggest in the area. Lots of furniture as well. Some places are kind of cramped but it's easy to find what you're looking for. The parking is a bit tricky and it's not hard to miss the store altogether if you aren't looking. It's right next to the freeway and the back part of the spree provides a nice view of it.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><UserId.>103366601089713739062</UserId.></record>

<Text>Today is 09/18/2018, I was overcharged almost 10 dollars at checkout. The fat black woman with long weave and single braids charged me $5.99 per t-shirt and they were suppose to be $3.99 each and she overcharged for 5 of them. I asked her how she charged each item cause she didn't even go through them, she just looked at what I had and she came up with her own price. I then said aren't shirts $2.99 and she said no and she looked embarrassed, but now I know they are $3.99. Goodwill is always changing prices and they hire people who act like they own the place. It's the principal of being fair, I'll even mention that she let a woman who was paying cash in front of me not even pay the full price. Cause I heard her say $27.75 and the woman working accepted $21 in cash from the customer. I feel that she used me to make up for what she owed on the register and that isn't fair. Everyone and anyone who visits this Goodwill, make sure that you keep track of what you are being charged for, otherwise you will feel used like I do right now!< /Text>< date>

I have found some pretty great items here so far without any lousy service yet from the reviews ive read so far. They even have a little corner of top designers such as chanel and the like, you know for all those yuppy hipsters out here in Walnut Creek area. All in all, I will be coming back more often as this year goes on.< /text>

<review>Absolutely terrible. This goodwill marks up everything to rediculus prices!
They marked a 25 dollar shelf from target up to 65 dollars even with a crushed corner, their costumes which in fairness are mostly new stuff donated from target were just as expensive as if i had gone to target, a board game that was ripped open was being sold for market price,  all video games are 5.99 each including the ones no one wants, and any clothing that wasnt target brand or trash was also marked up. A good third of the store is target merch that doesnt sell and their selection of books and electronics is seriously lacking.

This branch preys on people who think they are getting a deal because its goodwill, but they want a ton of profit and it sickens me.
Nice shiny walls though.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Went in for a general check up on a used Audi that I recently purchased. Scheduling the appointment and requesting a loaner car was easy. I worked with Antonio who was able to explain the process, history of the car, and possible things which would be needed in the future. The whole process was easy with great communication. I had a few random followup questions a few days after the service which Antonio and Joe were able to address. Great first impression for the Audi brand and happy to have my future services performed here.</text>

<text>Despite not having loaner vehicles available (even though I reserved one), the customer service (from Alfred) was above and beyond. I was driven home personally by Jackie, who was professional and kind. When my car was ready, I received a call and coordinated a pickup ride by Jackie.  I received a detailed report of my car repairs, and the complimentary wash. Great guys and staff at the Audi service center!< /text>< pics>

The hardest part of the visit was finding the right place to enter.  That's not unusual that dealerships of this size.  With only one one street address "what's a girl to do"  Once I was at the correct door, it was all smooth sailing.  Bonus... I found out that as an official customer of Fremont Audi (I used to go to another dealership) they will wash my car anytime I want.  Offering that service exemplifies their service standard.

Thank you Fremont Audi and my new bestest friend, Frank Santos.</review>

I looked for different Audi dealerships to service my car for warranty repairs and Fremont location seemed to have the better reviews and a recommendation from someone.  It is a bit further for me but so far the times I have been there the customer service is great from making appointments to staying in communication about my vehicle.  It’s nice that they have some loaners available if the service will take longer than a day.  It’s usually quick and easy to drop off/pick up when it’s time for your appointment.</Review>

Joe and Antonio took amazing care of me,

I brought my A3 in for recall work, so I thought, because the same issue came again before the recall. I had explained to them, but they were going to charge me a diagnostic fee for my car. After some discussions Joe, and I settled on a price we seemed fair if it was not a recall realted item. They put me in an amazing 2021 A6, and I was on my way. I later get a call from Joe explaining that it was not a warranty related problem. Joe then mentions it would be free and it would be taken care of by them. I have never ever been treated with such respect at any dealership anywhere. They took care of me, and I will continue to bring my Audi here for the future.</Text>

As fast as can be while still being "safe" and clean in these COVID times. I was told it would take 90 min for the service and a wash (I asked for rims only and they were happy to comply) it came back in less time than estimated . They emailed me the details of my vehicle and all was well!<//review>

All the staff that I have encountered in general are all very nice and helpful every time I stop by to ask for help or just a question. Definitely satisfied with services received at this dealership so far !</review>< user>

<Review>I have owned my Audi A6 2013 since 2015 and I have never taken it to the dealer for repair.  Mainly because it was an experience that I wanted to avoid.  However, recently I had to take my car in for recall repairs and reprograming of a lost key.
These guys totally changed my perception of service at dealerships.  They were extremely accommodating and professional.  Joe, the manager was my first point of contact and I quickly realized I was dealing with a different class of dealerships.  Subsequently, the bulk of the excellent service came from my service rep, Frank S.  He was amazing to work with as he has many years of experience servicing these cars.  He clearly proved to me that his first concern was not how much revenue he would generate from me.  He truly made me feel like he cared about me as a customer.  He was truly a pleasure to deal with!
No doubt this was a refreshing break from my past experience with other service dealerships.  I honestly believe these guys are a cut above the rest.
It was a refreshing break from the mold of service dealerships.
This is now my go to place for service on this vehicle!!<//Review><rate>5</rate>< Gmap_id>

David and the team are fantastic. The experience was on time, friendly and incredibly helpful. He took the time to further educate me about my car, specifically around the sensors and calibrating process. Then he went above and beyond to work with my insurance company and even got on the phone with me to help coordinate my appointment with the claim adjuster. I will bring my car back for any and all services. 👍👍< /text>

< Review>
We gave our Audi A6 for a first time service and they found a faulty passenger side air bag. They replaced it for free, in the mean time we were given Audi7 for 4 days.
We had to go on a vacation and the replacement was under progress and we were asked to pick it in 2 days. But we were off for a vacation for 12 days and they kept the vehicle for us untill we returned. We returned their vehicle and headed off  to our vacay, got back and picked our Audi. We are very happy with their service and would always go to them for a service.<//Review>

< Review>
I drive from Campbell to have my service and warranty work done at Audi Fremont.  I’ve been coming here since they first opened on the recommendation of my mechanic.  I have always been suspect of dealer service and service departments, so it  was a little scary for me to have a vehicle which requires dealer service for warranty purposes.  In 30000 miles, I have never been asked to perform or told I needed a service or repair I didn’t feel was appropriate or necessary.  So far, I’ve been very happy with the the service and staff.  Alex has been my advisor for my last few visits.  He and everyone I’ve dealt with are knowledgeable, professional, enthusiastic, and honest.  If you’re not sure how you feel about your dealer service experience, Audi Fremont could be your new spot.

Frank Santos is an excellent service advisor.  He has helped me on 3 different services for my Audi Q3 and always gave me the right advice in my best interest.  I really like how professional the service is in Audi Fremont and would highly recommend their service and sales team.< /review>

I brought my car in on the second part of the Fletcher Care package, so its an oil change and fluid refill like for window fluid and things. They say they also do a road test and light inspection of the vehicle. They tell me I have a nail in the tires and engine mounts are leaking and suggest changing.I change the tires elsewhere hold off on the mounts.. After a week or two my indicator comes on saying add windshield fluid.? Thats part of the job they were supposed to have done. Checked my oil it hadn't been changed, the indicator was beneath half. I let them know all this brought it back in and after a new diagnosis they recommended doing the motor mounts right away. They said it be done by Monday but it was done on Saturday, sounds good, but if they didn't do my service fully perhaps they didn't fully do this job is what I was thinking, I had those done and the car still handles and feels the same. I asked to have it checked again because if they didn't do my service fully perhaps they didn't do the mounts as they said they would. I was told that perhaps a secondary issue and may have something to do with the suspension.!?!?!? When they did the road test and checked the motor mounts, they didn't check the suspension? This just seems like "half doing" service as a way to drain money from a customer. I paid for a service and didn't get it fully, if I just came in and said my car feels funny thats one thing, but I paid for a service they found mounts leaking wouldn't they investigate further and for them to not inspect fully, causing me not only time on repeated trips to fix something that should have been identified on my initial visit its also costing money because who's to say it was the motor mounts in the first place and not the suspension all along. So they wanted me to pay for a diagnostic for something that should have been done under the service and the car still experiencing same issues as before so im feeling like I got ripped off for a service that was more expensive and still need the problem resolved so its more money. They have truly lost a customer in me, with this experience.</text>

Overall, not super happy with the service that was provided. Took my TDI in for service and had to wait a week For the dealer to do a software update and tell me that my car was still broken. After asking the service writer why it took so long, I was told that these TDI’s are a new beast to the dealer, and that they don’t have  experienced TDI technicians. Upon getting my car back the alignment pulls to the right. I asked the dealer about this, and they said they didn’t remove any suspension components, but the day before they sent me a pic of my car on the lift, with the whole front right suspension removed. It’s not a big deal, but they wouldn’t own that they made a mistake. I won’t be bringing my car back to this place again..<//text>

David was fun, polite and made things really quick and easy. My  car had about 130k miles on it and was leaking in a few areas. He worked with me to explain which which important to fix and which were less critical, so I could fit my budget. I appreciate the honesty, speed of service and professionalism of everyone.< /review>

<Text>This time I went in for an Audi MMI recall on my S3. I was immediately greeted and treated well by the staff there. Here's my thoughts:

My experience of Audi Fremont has been consistently exceptional and memorable. Every time I have gone there... the staff from the service managers to the cashiers have been courteous, professional and incredibly friendly. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time there and they have answered all my questions and always been generous in their loaner vehicles. Last two times, I was able to drive a 2019 Audi Q5 with less than 100 miles on the odometer, and recently I was able to experience a 2019 Audi A7. Both rides were wonderful and exceptional (as expected with Audi's) but just made me want to consider a future Audi one day. Thank you for making car ownership and maintenance a painless and fun process!

Update: 12/3/2019 - Had my s3 in for its scheduled service and once again David De La Torre and the Audi team were fantastic from those service garage people who took my car to David & those at the service / billing desk... every person that I was privileged to work with was courteous, communicative and incredibly helpful. This time I got a 2020 Audi Q5 with 13 miles on the odometer to drive around. I drove it for a short while thinking i'd have to leave my car till later but ended up coming back after a few hours and my car was ready soon after. Excellent service and excellent personnel. You all at Audi Fremont are the MVPs!

Update: 9/21/2020 - I recently had to drop off my Audi for a climate control issue and while I was there, Frank Santos the service manager was able to help answer and meet my issues. I have enjoyed this dealership’s quality of service esp. their service department over the past few years and this time was no different. They provided a loaner (cozy A4) and were highly communicative of what they were doing to my car. I was unable to come in on the day of pick-up (Saturday) due to a busy weekend and Frank told me it’s fine to come in on Monday. I have enjoyed also the wonderful assistance of the Lady working at the payment / cashiers desk and this place always makes me fee like an appreciated customer. Highly recommend!!<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>This review is for their service department. I went there for a rear brake service. I like the ease of setting up an appointment online. I was able to book time the same day. They called me to confirm the appointment. I dropped my car at the dealership and they gave me a free ride back home. They also picked me up after the car was ready. The estimate given was the same as the actual cost. I also got the 10% discount offered for October. The car was washed and ready for pickup.
I also got a multi point inspection report.
Thanks to David, Joaquin (driver) and the lady that called me after I made my online appointment!<//Text>< gmap_id>

<text>Always great service at Fremont, the only complaint is when the rear license plate holder was installed, the technician stripped or broke it. I didn’t realize it was broke until two years later when I was changing the license plate frame and couldn’t do it.
Now I have to replace something that I didn’t know was broken.< /text><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1592583121720, 'text': 'Hi Dane,\n\nThank you for the 5 star rating!

<Text>Alex is probably the best service rep I have ever had across Audi! He is super enthusiastic, friendly, helpful, and remembers you by name! He processes paperwork quickly and before you know it, you are ready to go!

I enjoy the dealerships modern communication method of texting. I can receive loaner information and service status updates quickly and easily without having to call. Please note that they will call you if necessary!

Also the process of getting a loaner car is quick and each car I have gotten to drive has been awesome and fantastic! The loaners are clean and I have been able to drive the coolest and latest cars. Definitely gives me insight on what my future ride might look like ;D..!</Text>< Pictures>

I came in late in the day before closing and Frank Santos advised me he would do his best to see if someone was willing to put on my bracket for me so short of notice. I was so happy someone did stay late to help put on my bracket for my Audi 6. I will definitely recommend Audi Fremont to others. Thank you. Cheryl Smiley</text>

Frank Santos is the man - always helping out and making himself available, even when he's busy.  Work with Frank as he's very straight forward.  Rather have a person who is going to be upfront and honest.

My service advisor, David de la Torre, was great!  Very efficient, friendly, helpful.  Got me the car done ahead of time.  The only gripes with the service are that I don't understand why they take the time to "wash" it if they're not going to get it even remotely clean and the perennial complaint that every time I get the car back (from any dealership) the seats, mirror, even headlight controls are not left in the position I had them.  Annoying - especially since most of those are fixable if they simply push the memory button that their cars come with.<//review>

It was a truly exceptional experience. We bought an Audi 2.0 T and the service provided by Abdul Sam and Bob, surpassed all normal standards.
Abdul explained each and every feature in details and that made us aware how amazing Audi A4 is. Bob gave us a wonderful deal and we are absolutely delighted. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to buy a new or preowned car, you will not feel the need to go anywhere else.< /text>

My car had the first service here, though I didn't buy it from Audi Fremont. Due to their good reputation, I didn't hesitate to drive all the way from very south bay to Fremont, instead of going to a closer dealer store. They didn't disappoint me. I arrived at 10:15AM on Saturday. Service center isn't crowded. We were helped immediately. Our service advisor is very helpful and he answers our questions very clearly with a good manner.

We decided to wait for the service done. There's a plaza with several restaurants right across the street, so we can walk around and have lunch while waiting.

One minor problem is that I was told the service should be done in about 1.5 hour, but it eventually took almost 3 hours. Not a big deal to me at this time, since I was totally enjoying watching those R8 and Q8 in the lobby.</review>

I had my wife with me in dropping off and picking up our vehicle.  We both agreed that your service exceeded our expectations.  Dropping off/checking in our vehicle was totally without any problems and your service personnel had a loaner already for us.  It was like a well oiled team.  Returning the loaner after we were notified our vehicle was ready and picking up our vehicle was smooth as silk.  Review of repairs by Alex Lira was very comprehensive.  Overall my wife kept commenting how polite and courteous your people were; she was totally impressed.  Our vehicle (washed and vacuumed) was waiting for us before we stepped out of the service area.  You’ve got our vote, thumbs up, keep up the good work and service.  Your operation was totally in-sync, Alex Lira and your team are fantastic!!!<//text>

<Review>Great service and Frank Santos always receives  you with a smiling face. Lots of people around service area are ready to help if they are free and I can’t measure the satisfaction. Even you wait for few minutes they provide you with snacks, coffee and free WiFi. If you are still bored of waiting, go take some great selfie with the latest Audi cars; great display at Fremont Dealership. Happy Thanksgiving and Happy Holidays. Great way of using Uber services for drop off and pickup to/from a location.< /Review>< pics>

The facility is awesome just reduced one star because of the experience with Finance  Manager who delayed my deal. The 4 stars are entirely for the Sales Staff and the Facility’s Manager Huck who was a delight! He solved all my concerns in time. Thanks Huck for the help! The sales staff were also very forthcoming and did a great job.<//text>

< review>
Came here for a service on my A4. I was able to hear a rattling noise from the right side of my dash which was very tough to reproduce. My advisor was David de Latore. As soon as he got my complains - he asked shop foreman Anton to have a look. And this guy is so damn good. We had a test drive and Anton was able to hear/reproduce/investigate the noises. Moreover, instead of the typical disassembling the dash - he was able to isolate the noise and found that the root cause was in the A pillar. So dash was not really touched.

Very satisfied with the Audi service so far as I am comparing with a similar experience I had with my BMW 3 series in Stevens Creek.
It is so much easier to replace "an oil filter" rather than found the root cause of the tricky noise in the cabin. I am really appreciating professionals who can focus on details.

Despite I have a closer dealership I will go with Audi Fremont for my car maintenance!< /review>

<Date>1543382514491</Date><Rating>5</Rating><text>Jesse Pastor is a solid Service Advisor. No more needing to drive to San Jose or Palo Alto, I love how it’s local.

Jesse keeps you in the loop with every status update while your car is being serviced. Jesse is very transparent with what was done with your car and he goes above and beyond to make sure your expectations are met. I highly recommend this delarship but I can only speak about the service department. I haven’t purchased a new car from them. I currently own a Q5 and S3. I have Audi care and Audi care plus maintenance plans. Fremont Audi also provides high mileage maintenance plans, give them a call for more details.</text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<text>I had been communicating with Service Advisor David de la Torre and set up my appointment through him.  But Jesse Pastor was the one that checked me in and set me up.  It was a very good experience.  He was very clear in his explanations and didn’t try to upsell me on anything unnecessary, which I truly appreciated.  I was able to get a loaner and was finished in time to get home before traffic.  All I’m all, I’m very happy I chose Fremont over Palo Alto where I purchased the vehicle. (nothing against them...I’m just closer to Fremont).   Thank you...I’ll definitely return as long as I own the vehicle!< /text></record>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I bought my Audi A4 from Adib Ayubzai of Fremont Audi. The experience was phenomenal. I had been in a massive car accident a couple weeks before and my car which had been only 1.5 years old was totaled. I was feeling really down and sad about the whole situation. I dreaded the fact that I’d have to start all over again.

When me and mom walked into Audi Fremont we were greeted warmly and offered coffee. Adib’s first statement was what I was looking for in a car. It was nice to be asked rather than told. And from 4 pm until 1 am (which was completely passed their closing time)..he got me exactly what I wanted. Pricing in the beginning was out of my range but Adib’s manager Andy went out of his way to approve a price that was comfortable for me. I can’t thank him enough.

At the end of the night we were settled on two A4’s one was white and the other was black. I was completely in love with the black so Andy had it driven out for me from another lot while Adib quickly handled all my paperwork which he made very easy to understand and laid out everything detail by detail.

We were all tired by the end, but it was Adib and Andy’s service which made me part of the Audi Family for life. Thank you gentlemen, you guys are amazing!</text>< Pics>

Please dont go for this service centre.Today i have bad exprience they are just simply charging for un necessary charges which are not necessary and they mentioned like if you wont fix it  then you may met with an accident like they are simply scaring you to buy and install the parts. Please if they are charging for anything please ask the price they will be confused since they dont the price they simply adding the amount like how much they wish.Before you are paying for the parts please check the prices in online audi website</Review>

One was regarding brake noise and the other was with the blind spot monitoring system.  The concern with the blind spot monitoring system does require a diagnostic test to identify if any issues are present and  is a required  practice by the manufacture when troubleshooting most vehicle concerns. This service is a set price that you declined to have completed.\n\nThe team did offer a visual inspection for the brake noise. After the  inspection was completed, we informed you about the rear brakes measurements and wear needing attention and should be replaced sometime soon. We shared our concern for the brake performance and safety possibly being an issue  If it wasn’t addressed. Upon receipt of this information, you inquired further about brake work and the  worst case scenario for the braking system  if this work wasn’t performed and wanted it in writing.  Unfortunately this written request was something we couldn’t provide nor predict how your brakes would wear over time, nor would we put a guests safety at risk due to declined services.\n\nYour satisfaction is important to me, and would welcome opportunity to accommodate your service needs. I was informed we gave you a list estimates and recommendations for you vehicle. If you would like to review or discuss those concerns, or speak on your recent experience please contact me directly at (510) 403-3691.\n\nKind Regards,\nBrandon Allen\nClient Relations'}<//response>< Gmap_id>

<text>I've been to Audi San Francisco, Audi Burlingame, Audi Stevens Creek and Audi Fremont.

Audi Burlingame was the worst. However, Audi SC and Audi SFO were good but I had excellent experience at Audi Fremont. The folks were super helpful and took good care of my car. I got a nice loaner and they replaced my Takata Airbag the same day. The location was super clean and had great ambiance. I would go there again.<//text>< pictures>
