Our friends at Aqua Nail Spa have done a beautiful job again. Amazing (all female) staff, some familiar faces and some new yet all delightful and focused. Quality and service are always the top two things that make me a loyal customer, Aqua nails has both. I worked with two new technicians this visit for a pedicure and acrylic nail dip powder; and I’m very much looking forward to working with these young ladies again!!</review>

<Review>$70 for disgusting nails. Yeah no thanks!! I went in, my first time and had a bas experience. The lady (LISA) finished the full set with gel, and it was not cute. I had bubbles under and patchy. So I informed her that I didn't like the color and had her remove it. Soon as I made that clear, the employees all started talking in their homeland language and that made me feel uncomfortable.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2C3_C0mYt0IC_VM4YkkencGoGZdxt6jJZxKtF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

He cares, his esthetics are outstanding, the quality of his work and products are top notch which is important these days. The quality of his work can’t be replicated!

Always enjoyed the service, but now with COVID in mind was very pleased with their cleaning and safety precautions. I think it’s by appointment only right now due to Beverly Hills’ reopening rules, but worth that extra effort.< /review>

<text>They do a great job.  The salon is clean, prices are comparable to the neighborhood and the owner is honest. I've followed her for over 15 years and and she ALWAYS has quality people work on me. I couldn't recommend Aqua Nail Spa more.< /text>< Rate>

$70 for disgusting nails. Yeah no thanks!! I went in, my first time and had a bas experience. The lady (LISA) finished the full set with gel, and it was not cute. I had bubbles under and patchy. So I informed her that I didn't like the color and had her remove it.

The space is bright and clean and the staff is always friendly!  I religiously visit my favorite manicurist there and always leave with a gorgeous mani pedi.  Thank you Aqua!<//review>

I’ve been going here for a few months and use Tami for my gel manicure and pedicures,  she is really good and gives a really good massage also,  also the place is very clean and in a great location with good parking. Located in the heart of Beverly Hills.</Text>

I love coming here specially during summer because it's so fresh.  A lot of parents bring their kids here to play. They have an entire section for kids to play pretend. Attached are pics for  reference.  Super clean, friendly staff, a lot of parking.< /text>

In final Library card holder or not and ya want a quit spot to do your thing go and visit. Even if it's like me once in a rare while go when nothing else to do at home at least ya got out and about for a bit.</review>< time>

<review>I liked this library. Setting up an account here was very quick and painless, but the librarian seemed hesitant until she verified that I had a valid California ID with my address on it, then she seemed more than happy to help!

While I was having my account set up another lady brought her child to the front counter so that they could check out a book, the librarian that was assisting her informed her that normally they did an electronic checkout, but after the lady explained that she knew and was trying to give her child the "real" experience the librarian assisted her by checking out the books - I thought that was super sweet.

I love the kids section, they have a small playhouse and some toys that help keep small children entertained and quiet, there's an adequate amount of seating for parents who are supervising, and suprisingly the area is reasonably quiet. There are a lot of books for children but I haven't browsed through them quite yet, I am going to wait until my son is a little older to borrow books for him.

Several of the books that I was looking for, for myself, weren't at this library. They do have a nice selection, though.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Very quick to receive books ive had to order and wait for.
Very easy to find sections inside the library that you're looking for. And if you cant find it,  there's always staff on hand.
Books look very decent and well taken care of.
Love the services they provide from tablets, e-readers, computers to printing and many programs within.  I absolutely love it. I only really go for the books but it's always usually busy with students and kids studying and playing.
I also love how accessible it all is online.

i'm not sure when, but it did get a nice makeover.

Also, don't skip out on the books for purchase section. You can take as you please and pay as you see fit.
I've left boxes of books for them to sale or do ....as they please.

I read from another library patron (from san diego) ......that she'll usually donate puzzles once she is done with them and I think that's such a neat idea and something I look forward to doing when possible<//text>< pics>

<Text>Very helpful people who give good customer service. I like going there when I need something instead of to one of those large chain stores. They will have less selection.

Loved the prices and the selection of items. My favorite was this new Weatherwash wood stain that ages wood, just what I wanted. Would come here again for this.<//Text>

Love shopping here, so, so sad they're closing. Hope Lowe's opens a smaller Lowe's hardware store  here and hires back these employees. So close and convenient.<//Review>

<Text>I come here for the plant nursery. Love their variety of plants! They usuallly have a better selection than Lowe's or Home Depot and will have more inventory so the rare plants don't run out on the first day. The employees also know to water succulents and cactus differently than the rest so I feel more confident I wont take home a plant that'll start rotting. Prices are a little higher than the others but worth it for the friendly service and good selection.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Nice clean design. I love the renovation. The staff is very helpful and in greater abundance than at the larger competition stores. The prices may not be as good, but there are perks if you become a Club OSH member.<//review>< username>

<text>They are better than the Home Depot for sure. But recently I don't think they are as good as before especially some of the employees who's been working there long time. I think those people are just tired of their job or tired of treating customers. I didn't feel the same greeting as before or the same attention as before. Yes they are bigger now, but are they thinking that they don't have to care about regular customers and they will become another The Home Depot that don't care people come or not?<//text>< Pictures>

Always so helpful and so knowledgeable. Lowe's is closing all the OSH stores. Huge loss. People here really know what they're doing.  They actually could fix anything I brought in. They always had the right solution and the right suggestion. They actually cared about the customer and making sure that they could help customer. That is a rare thing.< /Review>

<text>Okay well l just got an obnoxious customer service person which has completely made me turn around and go elsewhere..... If I am asking a question,no matter how mundane ,have the decency to answer respectfully.... Believe me l don't want to make calls to ask if you sell certain item but l'm new to the area and just needed help.
Maybe a refresher course on good manners would be a good place to start!!!!!!!!</text>< pics>

<Review>WOW!!! Went there this morning, right after I got off work, and I'm NEVER GOING BACK!  They don't deserve my patronage!!
1. The dark haired woman in the paint department @ 8:30am is the reason I
put down what I came in to buy, and walked out!!  WHAT A RUDE RUDE
CREATURE!  NOT HUMAN! TOO MUCH BOOZE LAST NIGHT?!  WHAT A
SHREW!!
2. Every employee had a scowl on their face. I just got off work and I was
happier than any one of them!  Don't they get paid?!
I went to Napa Auto and got what I wanted, and though it was a bit more expensive, I was HAPPY TO PAY THAT PRICE!  THE GENTLEMAN  BEHIND THE COUNTER WAS SO FRIENDLY AND KIND!!  THEY DESERVE MY MONEY!!  Unfortunately, I had 4 keys cut at Orchard, a few days ago, 2 of which don't work!  But, I'm returning all of them!  THEY CAN GO TO HELL!<//Review>< user_name>

I love these guys. I find the staff really tries to help me find my items and solve my problems. I like the new store design and the variety of items they offer. They do not have the strongest garden section in terms of variety and the staff there generally rates a C in knowledgeability, but the store is a phenomenal neighborhood store offering any number of items the standard amateur DIY needs.<//text>

I would have been suprised to be treated by a store that literally has nothing useful or complete if contains multiple peices to work properly so disgustingly and without anything slightly resembling a bad form of customer service had I not been into this location at some point long ago but even though it's going out of business I was told repeatedly I can't purchase this item or that ect until the end of the items I was really looking forward to getting<//review>

OSH Millbrae is a store that usually has plenty of workers on duty in case you have a question or need help.  Sometimes their pricing is a bit high compared to other stores.

Note that OSH is owned by Lowe's.  I'm unsure if OSH matches internet prices in general but OSH WILL match Lowe's online prices if you bring the difference to their attention.</text>

My experience at Sushiko was terrible and I will not come back for any reason. The customer service was absolutely ridiculous and no one seems to have patience. During this pandemic and with only outdoor seating, there wasn’t even one heat lamp, making it very uncomfortable to sit and enjoy dinner. Instead of sitting outdoors and enjoy the somewhat normal life again during these times, the food came packed in to-go bags and the sense was that they would prefer us to leave then stay. I don’t recommend to anyone.<//review>

Positives: staff was awesome. Super friendly and accommodating. Sat really quickly and food came out relatively fast.

Cons: fish was not fresh, the imitation crab was the worst I've ever experienced. Didn't care for any of the rolls I tried.

Pretty disappointing for someone who from the Midwest who was really looking forward to getting some fresh sushi in LA.</text>

I Ordered a Veggie Carterpillar Roll to go, just to find out that 3 ingredients were missing; carrot, cucumber and avocado. That was a sloppy work for $13 roll.<//Review>

Take out and delivery orders are not filled completely, worse customer service! They just simply don’t care when they missed chopsticks and rice and ruined your dinner.... Management is careless . Fish is not that fresh</text>

<review>The servers were sullen and curt with us, we weren't spoken to when we came in or when leaving, our food was unceremoniously put on the far side of the table from us with barely a mention of what each dish was, we were never checked on after ordering and after 20 minutes I had to go get a menu from the server area for dessert. The check was also not given another 15 minutes after getting the dessert and I once again had to get up and go get it from the server.
The food was decent but not great and the overall experience was easily one of the worst I've ever experienced in LA. I cannot recommended this place over any other sushi establishment.</review>< Pics>

<Review>Love this sushi place for a few reasons. It is kosher, has good service, and you have screens that shows you how the chefs are making the sushi. And the sushi is yummy!

Downside, hard to find parking if the lot outside is full. (They do have their own lot of ~7 slots)< /Review><Date>1470107039882<//Date>< Gmap_id>

Old sushiko was amazing. Old sushiko was one of my favorite part of LA. Old sushiko would not have served me tuna tartar that consisted of mayonnaise, raw onions, and tuna. It was honestly the greatest culinary travesty I've ever had the misfortune of eating.</review>

a little over priced, but well worth it. Fresh, not too fishy of a smell, and presentation is insane!  The place itself is a little small, but plenty of people were there,  and the service was good too. will be back for sure and highly recommend</text>

Sushi was tasty, BUT service extra slow. We were waiting for a waiter around 20 min, and then food arrived before cultery. If you in no rush, yeah this is a nice place, but if you want to stop by for quick dinner, forget about it.< /review>

<rating>4</rating><text>I have been there twice.  Ignoring all other factors like their services and the price, I liked sushi they served.  It was very fresh and the quality of handling fish was very satisfactory.  Specially, I loved their sea hedgehogs.  I never had a such a big & fresh sea uni.  If you never have it before, you've better try this spiny fish as a whole.  I had it with their recommended SaKe..I forgot its name (Ask the chef and he will recommend it)...anyway I was sooooooo~ good.  Though their parking lot is little inconvenient and the service can be improved little bit,  I will definitely go back to this place for their sushi.  If you can't judge what the good sushi is, don't go there....instead buy it from your grocery store.<//text>< Pics>

Truly disgusting food. The sushi was dry and fishy tasting. The rice was dry and old and the cucumber salad was spoiled, brown and squishy. Really incredibly bad sushi. Supermarket sushi is better.<//Review>

I think it was the most disappointing sushi place that i have ever been at. It was the worst 4$ miso soup in my life. It was super sweet for some reason. Ralphs crunchy sushi roll is better than this place. Selection is really limited, no teriyaki and no baked rolls.</text>

Poor service. Food is not worth the price. I wouldn't recommend if in the area or a local. Flavorless. Done with no effort. Waited 20 mins for refill.<//text>

<Review>I stopped by here at a friend's suggestion. Went right after shabbos and expected the place to be packed... Surpsingly, it wasn't that busy, but the service was incredibly slow and a little annoying. The food took so long to come out, but we had only ordered one roll and the tuna tratare. We had to ask twice for an update because of how long it took. The first beer we ordered was so flat, but the server was kind enough to replace it very quickly. Given all the Kosher options nearby, I really wouldn't bother with this unless you're seriously craving sushi</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
Went with my friend for late night dinner. Took 10 mins to get seated even though the restaurant wasn't even packed. Once seated took about 10 mins to get menus. 5 mins later we were able to order drinks. That also took a while. The wait staff is young and inexperienced. Maybe the restaurant was way understaffed. The food is mediocre at best. My friend and I both ordered different salands. They were exactly the same apart from (grilled salmon and sashimi). It's kind of disturbing because I don't understand what plain, canned, untreated corn has to do with a sashimi salad. Btw it wasn't mixed or dressed either. My friend ordered a Philly roll I got a handroll. It was good what bothered me though is the untreated seaweed. In a handroll it was so chewy I could barely bite through it. Their sushiko roll is greasy and tasteless. Salmon punch roll or w.e it's called was ok. Their sake is way overpriced too. Where all normal and even high in places charge anywhere from $13 to $15 for a bottle of Nigori they charged us $13 for a house bottle which isn't even a equivalent to half of a normal bottle. I do not recommend.<//Review>

<Review>Incredible sushi, I was served by two beautiful waitresses, lola and jessica, who took care of my every need making my experience here one of a kind. If they're working here I'm definitely coming back! 10/10! The medium platter was really good. I suggest the sushiko roll and the mango madness roll!< /Review></record>

Anyone that says this sushi is even mildly good lacks a single taste bud. Awful. And not that cheap. My wife and I spent 70 dollars on the slimiest, grimiest sushi I've ever had. Even the edamame was mealy! How do you screw up edamame? Do. Not. Go.< /review>

Sam was my time technician, who very respectfully & professional, he accessed my needs and quickly serviced my car. Pricing was fair and there was absolutely no wait. His lovely wife offered me a cold water while I waited which was much appreciated. My tires were changed in less than 15mins. I would definitely go back back recommend to friends and family. Thank you for wonderful service.</Review>

<Response>None< /Response><Review>This is one of the places I really tried not to leave a review for so I keep it secret to myself, but then I felt bad for people who go to all the other over priced tire shops in the valley. They are nice people and have variety of used and brand new tires. I was looking for used tires for my Alfa Romeo lease return and after I called 9 different tire shops, I finally found a pair at Tire Boyz, they also got my contact information so they can hit me up whenever they find another pair. This is definitly your #1 to go tire shop.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80c29bb1f76ca981:0x1a7147055bc1028e<//Gmap_id>< name>

<Review>1 Step Smog,registration, and tags Best smog test place ever!!!!!!! Done in 1 quick visit. Very reasonable prices and the convenience is above excellent. The smog test technician was fast , knowledgeable, friendly & efficient, The staff (I believe it is family owned) Are awesome and friendly. They have a post office, great food selection and have all kinds of beverages you would expect to find in a classy specialty store at great prices. They definitely put the customer 1st!!!!! I have a 97 Honda accord and it has passed with flying colors on 3 tests there now. I would recommend them to everyone..... They deserve 20 stars way better than any other smog place I have ever been to!!!!<//Review>< Resp>

The owner is wonderful and friendly. He will literally order the snacks you like if he doesn't carry it. He is also a realtor 😁<//review>

Fast friendly service.  Way better then spending all day in the dmv. In and out in less than 15 minutes. And when I have to smog my vehicle it's all right there. I'll pay the fee it saves my time and sanity.</Text>

These technicians are slow! And their prices are ridiculous! After waiting for an hour i decided to look for another location and I found one that was just around the corner and about 15$ cheaper. AA smog was great! Quick and cheap!<//text>

The guy who helped me was really nice and made me laugh. There was no wait and didn't take a long time to pass the smog test.  He sent the pass electronically to the DMV correctly and the pricing was average.< /text>

I've gotten my last two Smog Checks done at this location and the fellow that works there is really nice. The people running the Valero are also very nice folks as well. Prices at Valero are not very competitive but the place is so clean that it's not that big of a deal to me. Right across the street is a mobile home park with a lot of tweakers that come in and out of it so do to this poor location I've given it 4 out of 5 stars.<//Text>

How many people know you in the community, where you live, your involvement in the community,  how you treat your employee, how you treat your tenant. I meet all these people everyday and I hear about how trashy you are. And now, I am your neighbor and instead of you are coming to me to say hi and discuss about the community issue, you use google platform and thrash me like this??? What do you know about me?? Any clue how much I am involved in the community, locally and internationally to betterment underprivileged people.   Kathy, you must be in your sixties or early seventies. I hope you grow up one day and learn how to be better person:( It is sad the way your are today. If you are brave a person, come discuss this with me in person. Please don't hide somewhere in the corner and thrash people in google platform. Please."}< /response>< rating>

< review>
I own the condo's next to Valero Gas Station. As stated in the last review, which mentioned the tweakers, here is a picture of where they live and are welcomed by the owner and his employees. They live at Valero!  This can be an unsavory place to visit at dark when the tweakers hang there and are actually working for food. Last year they started a fire behind the station probably from their campfire. Maybe Gary the owner has made a deal with the devil so now they are wreaking havoc on our property next door. Police and code enforcement are now  involved.  Very disappointing behavior and business standards. Gary, don't waste your time responding with your nonsense, you can respond to code enforcement. Photo attached.</review>

<Review>They stole 125$ from my card with a fake transaction<//Review>< response>
{'time': 1537802203755, 'text': "Katie,  your claim appears very fake at this time because, if someone steals money from your cards, all you have to do is call your card company and tell them what happened. You are not liable for money that are stolen from the card. In addition, have you talk to anyone in the store about this? Normally when you slid card outside, there's hold for 24 hours however, processing company makes correction within 24 hrs. Again, using card is pretty safe lately. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS CALL YOUR CARD COMPANY :)"}< /response>

He was so busy chatting with others that he didn’t follow up with service to us. I asked for decaf coffee with cream. He spilled half of the coffee onto the saucer and served it to me that way. He didn’t bring cream and when I reminded him he went on to chat with the nearby table and it took 10 minutes to get the cream. We ordered dessert and after 15 minutes he came back and asked if there was anything else. We told him we were waiting for dessert snd he said he forgot and it took another 15 to get it. This waiter is s a disservice to the restaurant. It’s now 2am and I can’t get to sleep because he gave me regular coffee. Unacceptable!!</Review>< Pics>

<Text>Just visiting and asked Google for suggestions since I had a hankering for Italian food. What a find! The marinated eggplant with great Italian bread was my first hint.
Good wine list, concerned service and Northern Italian cuisine that is hard to find. Would have driven right by it, tucked inside a strip mall on RT 111. Thank goodness they were open in the heat of the summer
I will be back.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Review>We hosted 17 guests recently in Palm Springs.  Trattoria Tiramisu came highly recommended from a friend that works at the JW Marriott in Palm Desert.   I phoned the restaurant and Miraku, the owner, answered and  put me at ease instantly!  I explained to her that we were renting a home and hosting several dinners for our guests.   Long story short, Trattoria Tiramisu delivered to most amazing dinner, plenty of it, with the most incredible Tiramisu for dessert!  If I could give them higher than five stars, I would!!!<//Review><gmapID>0x80dafe0b5b20a4a3:0x68d52c4e8678b13a< /gmapID>< UserId.>

The food flavor was nice and refined, but the one calamari appetizer was on the cool side. Yes; cool I said, and it was calamari fitta (which means fried). The polpo apetizer was yum. Service was attentive, and we were not rushed. I also got to enjoy speaking some Italian as the staff speaks as well as my client. This place is small, intimate, and discreet. I enjoyed my Salmon, and my guests likewise enjoyed their veal dishes. Do check-out this hidden authentic italian restaurant. It will be a go back for me.</Text></record>

Been here a handful of times. Not a huge parking area but sufficient enough to get the job done. Seems pretty organized and the people that work here are friendly. Very close to my house so its very convenient for me to go here.</Text>

Paper said I was to be paid $57 but when counting the money they guy made errors on purpose and rushed me to take my money. Upon counting it at home, I realized they shorted me $5! Which is literally 100 bottles that they stole from me.

So if you don't care about you're money then go here!! But if you do care about your money go somewhere else. Other reviews are very similar.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><gmap_id>0x809ac5044dde9381:0xc1e84e878944ab1e<//gmap_id>< Rating>

Very crowded on weekend and rushed through line. Instead of actual weighing their containers he just guesstimated the weight. For all the recycles I brought I usually get more cash at another place. Also employees unprofessional with their language no consideration of children present. I don't believe I got a fair weight/price of my recycles.<//review>

Haven't been to this bar sense the new owners bought it 3 years ago. It was my favorite bar in Oakdale when I lived there and now it's my favorite bar again. Thanks to meeting the owner and the friendly bartender Sara. I  had a blast last night and the place looks great!!!!<//text>

The bartender totally ignored me. Did not even offer a friendly hello or how are. What do you want ..here it is..thats it. She was very friendly and flirty with the people she knew though. I am new to town and looking for a regular spot but i guess they dont want to be friendly to new customers. Could be because i am a woman though. For some reason girl bartenders think they should only give good service to men. Do they forget that other women are more likely to be bartenders and servers as well and would probably tip better than most pervert guys? Well she can keep flirting with the pervs for her $3 tip then....i will not be back<//text>

Just OK.  When they're playing music, it's too loud to talk with someone at your table. But fun to dance.<//text>

<text>I called this morning needing to bring my service dog in for a bath because he got into something sticky yesterday.  I was offered an appointment within less than 2 hours.  I received a call immediately when his service was completed and when I picked him up, he was impeccably clean and happy!  The rate was very inexpensive for a regularly scheduled appointment and much more so for a last minute emergency.  I highly recommend this groomer.  Great service!  Happy customer!</text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Awesome! This place is wonderful! My only regret is I didn't find them sooner. Never had a groomer do such a good job. Thank you for taking such care with my grouchy old man.</Review>

I've been bringing my chow chow here for about a year now,  and I absolutely love how they groom her. I always emphasize her areas to avoid any UTIs she prone to, and they do an excellent job in addressing those areas without causing injury ect. Thank you for being so careful and gentle with her, as she is not a fan of baths.</Text>

I’ve been taking my fur babies to Amanda almost a year now and I am very happy with how my animals come home smelling so good. My Maltipoo always comes home with a great cut and Amanda always cuts his hair around his face exactly how I like it. I would recommend this place and the prices are great. I have taken my MaltiPoo to groomers for 12 years now and Amanda is top of the line in my opinion 👍👍👍< /Review>

<Review>Amanda, does a wonderful job on our 3 Morkies. She's reasonable, fast and a great groomer. We're new to Paterson, and didn't know about the grooming services here. I trusted her with my 3 babies in September 2016, and she's been grooming them ever since. My pups seem to love her. Can't go wrong with Amanda.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

I went in there worried about gett my dog trimed for the first time.(due to getting bad hair cuts. And my dog is adorable with her hairthe way it was) she explain to me what i should just cut her butt and legs with my pom. I was very nervous cause i am extremely picky when it comes to these thing and while i was sitting i was started to freak out saying she is cutting to much but when my dog came out she exceed my expectations. I am extremely happy thank you so much<//Text>

(Translated by Google) I did not like that they have the dogs for almost three hours locked in a cage waiting for their turn better to say they do not have time to serve them, not that they have them locked up and still waiting for the dogs to be so calm at the time that the dogs They go to bathe or cut their nails. They also bother you and they answer you badly according to why your dog urinates in the cage, locked up for almost three hours, that the dog can stand for so long without even doing one of his needs.

(Original)
No me gustó que tengan a los perros por casi tres horas encerrados en una jaula en espera de su turno mejor que digan que no tienen tiempo de atenderlos , no  que los tienen encerrados y todavía esperan que los perros estén tan tranquilos ala hora de que los van a bañar o a cortarles las uñas .aparte se molestan contigo y te contestan mal según que porque tu perro se orina en la jaula .encerrado por casi tres horas que perro soporta tanto tiempo sin tan siquiera hacer alguna de sus necesidades< /Text>

<review>Having given this taco bell multiple chances, and they literally cannot make my food right. Its not even hard orders. I've been upcharged adding sauce in the app which is fine or it would be if they could leave the meat off as I asked. Or you know actually cooking the potatoes I ordered instead of giving them to me frozen. Or ordering a box with three different items and getting a repeat of one of them and still getting charged more for the item I didn't get, after sitting in the drive thru for a solid 20 minutes. There was only one car in front of us and they got their food really quickly. Our order was not big.  Getting a drink that is basically colored water. I could go on. I would drive two streets down to go to the actually good taco bell on auto center drive and Blackstone. Don't waste your time with these people because your food will be wrong and probably cold if its cooked at all.<//review><Name>Sarah Garber</Name><gmapID>0x80946801c9424d5f:0x799072eba436ad24< /gmapID><rate>1<//rate><user>109382591968632477549<//user></record>

< Review>
First of all, I ordered online using their app, which isn't that hard to use. I selected the "walk-in" option. I get to the location and I notice there's a bunch of fences up.

No sign whatsoever. I doubted that it was open. With no way to tell, I go around and knock on the drive- in window. I accidentally startle one of the girls working, to which another woman comes to the window.

I politely explain that I ordered and wasn't sure if it was open. The lady looks at me with an angry look, to which she tells me, "Go around with your car."

We go around and we see the inside is under construction. No sign. Not sure if any dust from all the repairs was getting into the food, but I personally won't be coming back.</Review>

<text>Just gorgeous.  This place has so much to offer and one day of exploring and hiking is not enough! The falls are lovely in the spring. We were disappointed that the hiking trail to the foot of Bridal Veil Fall was closed, but we did make it to Vernal Falls.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Review>Always 5 stars for taco bell. Locos doritos tacos are bomb af. Also a great choice for gluten free. I know its not certified as gluten free or whatever, but It never upsets my stomach, which is all I ask for.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I love Taco Bell. Miss the inside dining while traffic watching. Love Nacho Fries. Chulupa. Great tasty food. Slushie drinks. The koisk you can order before getting to counter. ( Been a while since Covid so don't know if still operable.)<//Review>

This is the third time that I attempted to go to this Taco Bell when it says it’s open until 2 AM and they are closed. I’m not sure who updates the hours or whol  closes down the store location, but that you do not match and it’s very frustrating</Review>

< review>
The menu was limited and you don't know it until you order something they don't have. This place looks like hurricane covid showed up. It's dark inside, the drive through is closed, and there is no where to sit because of covid-19 regulations. The place looks sad just plain sad. I feel for the workers because that place was depressing and it's got to be getting them down. I will visit again after covid and hopefully this place will still be around.</review>

3rd time they forget something and final time because I will no longer go to this location.

Terrible service. I have been there three times and all three times they have screwed up the order.... i understand that working at a fast food restaurant  requires a certain skill set. However, it appears as though none of the emcees at this taco bell have any skills at all.</text>

Disappointing Chalupa. The shells tasted/felt like they were made a while ago, so they were not as fluffy/crispy as I'd expect. They were stiff and not very tasty. I wondered why it took so long for them to get my order together (2 chalupas, 1 regular taco). Once I actually got my food and was able to eat it the delay dawned on me: They had to find the Chalupa shells somewhere in the basement. Oh well. It's Taco Bell, not Nobu....<//text>

< Review>
This was a Taco Bell on Blackstone just South of Herndon Avenue. We ordered the Chalupaa Box that we get every week. Once we left and looked inside we discovered there was a burrito and a taco with crispas ,but no  chilupa. I turned around and went back inside only to be told that they didn't have that Box anymore so they just arbitrarily decided to substitute the burrito box without asking. They offered no apology and we will not be going there again.< /Review>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Text>Two stars for food/drink quality. Manager handled well.

Food was decent (chips tasted as though they had been cooked with cinnamon twists) and tea was horrific in both scent and taste.

Manager was apologetic and acknowledged something was wrong with it after being asked to smell and taste it himself but was unsure what caused this saying perhaps they used two tea bags instead of one. He also said he would discuss this issue with his team.</Text>< pics>

< review>
Went to order food Saturday around 10:30 or so. The drive through worker mentioned that they'd just run out of rice. We then chose items without rice because of this. 25 minutes later we are at the window and the same worker mentions that they've also run out of beans as three cars ahead of us ordered "like 15 burritos" and it really "threw her for a loop." It would have been nice to receive a heads up  at the same time we were notified about the rice. Doesn't seem very professional. Went to Arsenios across the way. Virtual got the same items, only cheaper, faster and fresher. Probably won't visit this location again. Turns out Taco Bell charges more to add guacamole, pico, and rice to items than a mom and pop type establishment. Bummer.<//review>

while eating noticed  the cook in the back coming up taking money then going back and making food with the same  gloves on not changing them.  Then then when my wife mentioned it to the manager he pretty much laughed at her, after that we left my wife went back into refill a soda they were there laughing and talking about her and right in front with her...  Very disappointed in that place. Very immature.. and unprofessional and just plain rude..<//Review>

Came to eat here for the first time in a long time and found that the restaurant to be very unclean. Restroom doors are locked and we were told to use the kiosk. The shift manager became very upset with the front help and could be over heard yelling at them front the restaurant. I will not come back here, EVER!!!!!!!! The kiosk in most places have bacteria on them and we did not want to use them but we’re told to. 🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️😏</Review>

<Text>Taco Bell is a food group unto itself. I really like grilled stuffed. After 50 year of eating their tacos when they actually had volcanic rock fire pits out front fired by cheap SoCal gas. Those were the real basic days, but they have pulled the basic taco though all that. Pretty amazing. I want a bean side dish like then. VV< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Food is good but they need more workers to get the orders out faster, to clean and to restock supplies. (Straws, lids and napkins) We stop by there quite often and have seen this happen 4 times out off 5.</Text>

I was totally disappointed in this Taco Bell.  I waited 30 minutes for my food, a chulupa.  How hard could that be.  After 2 or 3 orders after mine were delivered, they had to ask again what I ordered.  When I finally received it, the shell was very tough and cold.  I'll never go back there again.  It wasn't even busy at the time as it was close to 3:00 pm< /Review>

2 managers right now making the food. 2everything is slow. People were waiting 15 to 20 min for their food before me. I've been here 15 minutes myself. Taco bell is faster than most others but this is ridiculous</review>

I do not know him personally or professionally. Our  acquaintance ended when it started with a simple fix. I really appreciate him taking the time out of his day to replace my horribly made order even though it could potentially mess up their own inventory.

Thank you Lucio! You made my night for fixing my order.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Bad experience tonight. Very disapointed in management for letting kids run the business. I understand its a fast food place but at least get customers orders correctly and listen to what condiments customers want and dont want in their order. As many customers can suffer from food allergies etc. Drive thru got my order wrong. I corrected at the window. Then received the wrong order again. I got off to let them know the order was incorrect again. Then i got my house and noticed they didn't get me my full order. I paid for food I didnt get .Very VERY disapointed in this location. All workers were goofing off and lacked disapline as to how to speak to customers . I own a busines of my own, and I can gladly say I would not hire anyone on this shift . . Date 11/14/2018 working from 1030pm or so. They all need to be fired and or retrained . People avoid this location. It is not worth the hassle. First and last time I will go there! Very DISAPOINTED</text>

Scary place!  Cracked picture window from a bullet?  Bathrooms locked and the workers have to let you in because their keys disappear! Panhandlers congregate on the corner and approached us for money.  Even the food wasn't great.. Not returning!< /Review>

Store was very smelly and the service was awful. We ordered from the kiosk and didn't receive it food until 30 minutes later. And they weren't very busy.< /text>

<Text>Bad night management and poor attitude. Said they decided to close 28 minutes early due to low staff. There was one customer ahead of me in the drive thru who they chose to service but for some reason stated they were closed after having to call 2 seperate times while at the window. Thankfully, the taco bell by Fresno state had their business together.</Text><rate>1</rate><userid>113119691540521642585</userid>< Resp>

At night it's just a bunch of Spanish speaking ladies gossiping about customers orders, manners, and heard a whole convo about another Co worker. It's amusing honestly but if someone who got offended easily understood them it would be another issue. Surprised our order was correct to be honest with how much crap they were saying about the order.< /review>
