The RIGHT Kangaroo! There are a lot of Kangaroo movers, vans, and lines around, this one is the one you need. Shortest delivery among competitors, great pricing, and a very well done packing! Smooth move!<//review>

<Review>Great experience. I used Kangaroo to move for a work transfer from California to Cleveland Ohio. I had a few concerns with my move as my plans had to be changed last minute. I originally spoke to Chris and he was able to answer all my questions and concerns very quickly. When I called back with all my changes Franchon was very patient with me and helped me figure out what I needed to do to make this move as smooth as possible. The customer service at this company really went a long way in making my move easy.I would recommend this company to anyone needing easy fast service!</Review>< pictures>

<Review>Do NOT use this company. This was the worst experience of my life with any company!!! The whole experience was a nightmare. DAMAGED FURNITURE, MISSING ITEMS, NO COMMUNICATION, LATE DELIVERY.
The guys are extremely rough and hard on your stuff. Most boxes were pressed to half size to reduce the space they occupy in the truck, they don't even care about Fragile markings. HIGHLY Unprofessional and careless with your belongings

Again!  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!! THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF!!< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>To reiterate what others have said:
DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.
DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY
DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY

They are a poorly run company and a scam.

I was originally contacted by one of their employees to set up my move with a good rate that was "locked in." I sent picture of everything I was having shipped and put it in a list so they could use their "system" to figure out how full the truck was going to be. All good so far.

On the day of the move... they didn't show up. They called and said they would not make it.

On the next day of the move... they didn't show up. They were supposed to arrive between 8-11. Nothing by 10:30 so I called them and they said they were "on their way and would be there between 11-2." At 1:30 I get a call from the driver that they would show up at 4:30.

They show up at 4:30 and the head guy is just PRIMED to talk to me about overage charges. Great. Then comes the packing...

I have moved many times over the years and I have never seen anybody so bad at packing. They did not even know how to properly tape boxes. One guy was proud about the fact that it was his first day on the job. It showed. Just wrapping things in plastic and using BUBBLE WRAP to fit one dish in a box. Oh, and by the way, they dropped pieces, dropped furniture, left cigarette butts in yard, water bottles all around my house, and trash EVERYWHERE.

On top of all of that, the actual cost was 2.5X THE ESTIMATE. THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS MORE.

I attempted to contact the company and they answer about 1 out of every 50 times you call. They will promise you the world and underdeliver.

Then comes to the shipping. They "guarantee" between 7-21 days for delivery. I never heard a word from them. I called them on day 10 and I was promised "that I would get a call soon from dispatch telling me that my shipment was being loaded onto a truck." Day 14 passed. Day 20 passed. Day 21 passed. No word from them.

I call on day 21 knowing that my shipment hasn't moved and, miraculously, I get a hold of someone. The same guy I talked to before. He said my check did not clear until 3 weeks after my stuff was picked up because THE DRIVER DIDNT CASH THE CHECK ON TIME.

THEN he tells me that they simply forgot about my shipment.

WHAT?

Excuses upon excuses from the guy on the phone with nowhere close to a shred of customer service.

Eventually I get a phone call saying "great news your shipment has started and will be delivered next week." Yeah, great news.... The driver missed the week window all together and showed up the next week.

I can't say enough how much I despise this company. They are the absolute worst. You will never be able to reach them once they have your stuff. They will overcharge you every step of the way. I don't believe there is a customer service department.

If I could give negative stars I would.</review><Rating>1< /Rating><user_id>104450584262627087675</user_id>< Pics>

We were moving from Southern California to the Houston area for retirement. We contacted Kangaroo Van lines along with several other moving companies for bids to move two large homes to one in Texas. Everything was going great including the price, communication etc. The original binding bid came in at just over $15,000. Michael was our agent that planned our move including household, boat and 4 cars. Thus the original bid for the household was at over $15,000, Boat was  $1,200, cars were $600 each. Once everything was loaded for some reason that stated that we had far more then they calculated thus the household move increased to over $42,000, boat to $1,700 and each car to $1,000. Once they got to our new home they would not unload till I gave them an additional $600 due to have a two story home with more than 6 steps and they also wanted to charge me for short haul due to the long driveway. I told them the semi was able to back in here for the people that moved out so you shouldn't have any issues. We sustained numerous breakage to our antique furniture and dishes. We also loss several boxes with expensive items in them. Total loss is around $6,000 plus.  Trying to get in contact with Kangaroo has been next to impossible, left numerous messages but no response. Therefore, I have contacted an attorney and have reached out to California' s Attorney General to investigate this company. By all means do not use this company.< /review>

<Text>Finally a good experience with a moving company!!! Unlike most people who never or maybe once in a lifetime make a major move, we have moved several times state-to-state with our growing family. Moving is tough, and moving companies typically add to the stress before and create frustrations after. This time with Kangaroo was the first time we actually felt at ease throughout the entire process. Chris the sales rep was so nice, explained everything with great patience, and went over every detail so there would be no surprises. Their customer service throughout was so helpful, Maya was super easy to reach and ALWAYS had a solution to our little issues and last minute changes. The day of the move also went smoothly with a friendly crew and a polite Joshua, the foreman. This was a big move – California to Florida – but all in all, and with one of the lowest quotes we got, we managed to get through it in the best way possible. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Kangaroo Van Lines for all your long distance moves.< /Text><user_name>Orit Gmach< /user_name><Rate>5</Rate>< Response>

I went to LA to help a friend's grandpa move out of state. Prior to the move, my friend got very helpful and friendly customer service. The day before the move was to happen, they asked us to provide a detailed list of dimensions of furniture and number/sizes of boxes. We took a lot of time to ensure we provided accurate dimensions of everything. Based off our list, they sent us a new quote that was less than the original quote. However, when the actual movers showed up the following day, they said there was no way the amount of furniture/boxes we had would fit into the cubic feet we were quoted, and to move everything would be DOUBLE the cost. We ended up leaving most of the furniture in California because it was going to cost less to buy all new furniture than to move what he owned. We were even at a point that we were pulling boxes back off the truck and having to very quickly re-prioritize what he needed to avoid the additional moving fees. The customer service rep stopped answering our calls and wouldn't return messages. It was a stressful and emotional time, and this company made it so much worse. They were to have everything moved to his new home within 14 days. That time came and went without any communication from the company. After repeated calls to them, we were finally able to get a moving date. It took 37 days for his things to arrive. We think everything arrived. Most of it isn't damaged.<//Review>

Big thanks to Ryan for helping me move my mom out to Utah. His team moved all the big stuff decently and fast, the costomer service with Ryan A+ but I'd give everyone else an A= to B+
The crew was professional and a great help with the move. I would recomend them to a friend or family. Thanks again.<//Text>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>If you chose Kangaroo, be prepared to work with an unprofessional, unethical, and dishonest company.

We've moved 8 times throughout the country over the past 32 years, major household moves.  This move was for my son to a one bedroom apartment.  One would think, "this is going to be a breeze".  Quite the contrary.   Kangaroo securing our business was a simple process.  The day the furniture was picked up, to the time between pick up and delivery, and delivery was nothing but stressful and unprofessional.   Let me clarify, day of pick up we were moving LESS furniture than planned but Moving Services Skokie Illinois tried to charge us more for the materials to protect the furniture (blankets, tape, etc).   The gentleman I dealt with was rude and unprofessional.  I had to make several calls to rectify this issue and fight my cause.  Everything at the time of quote was specified such as the TV Console having 2 glass doors and Moving Services said they had to charge us for the cardboard required to protect the glass.  Everything that could have gone wrong that day, did.   Then the gentleman had the nerve to ask for a tip $$   What do they teach these employees?
In between pick-up and delivery, communication was non-existent.  I had to call to many times to get delivery information.   Then was given the drivers number to call, only to spend 2 days calling that number with no response then on the 3rd day told that the plans changed and it's a different driver.   Then I had to start the calling process over again. ( During this time I tried reaching out to the sales rep, Chris Brown, and never received a call or text back).
The day of delivery (apartment complex, 1st floor).  The driver of the Budget Rental truck informed me that there would be an extra charge because they had to walk more than 75 feet to the door.   Now they must have thought I was gullible because I suggested they back the truck up to the sidewalk so they didn't have to walk as far.   Guess what, I was no longer trying to be haggled for an additional fee.

Can't express my disappointment enough!!< /Text>< user_name>

I needed some help moving from LA to Houston so I got recommended this company from my half-sister. I trust my family 100% so wanted to give this a try since it was the first time I was moving from one to city/state to another. I was totally on board, with the methods this company was offering me  along with price &  made me feel comfortable with my possessions. On the day of the move they were so friendly and professional and fun to be around. It didn’t matter what they were moving; everything was treated with so much care that I knew I was set for Houston!  I don’t write many reviews but 4 STARS for this especially when moving because I was so stressed since its basically your life in items that you want preserved and brought with you and thats what this company did.< /text>

In June 2020, I put a $100 deposit against an expected move from Arizona to Colorado. When I tried to contact the agent to settle the details, I was unable to reach him. I left repeated messages, but never heard from him.  Ultimately, I made other arrangements and in September, requested that they refund my deposit. I was assured by their Accounting Dept that the money would be deposited ‘within 7 to 10 business days’.  Three weeks later, I contacted them, and was assured that they were working on it. Now it has been 2 months, and a call today resulted that they couldn’t refund the deposit and that I should contact my credit card for the refund.  DO NOT GEt INVOLVED WITH THIS COMPANY UNDER Any CIRCUMSTANCES!</Review>

If i could i would give 0 stars.They where absolutely great with setting up the whole thing, then it turned into an absolute nightmare. After picking my things up, i gave an address to drop off. After that i gave them ample time to deliver and when it was late, they consistently refused to answer and return my phone calls. After 2 months of waiting they stated they would take off $30 a day for everyday they where late. Then upon delivery they stated i had to pay way more than what was stated when they picked. Refused to give my things until i paid in full without taking the $30 for each day off and that they would issue me a check for those days, yet changed it to every business day. Its been iver a week and still no call and wont answer about the check. After my things where delivered the glass boxes where smashed several items where missing and broken. So very disappointed in this company. They are extremely unprofessional and un organized.</review>

<date>1596808850112< /date><review>( Predatory company, Do not use. You will regret it) We had them come to pick up our stuff and move it out of state. They do this over the phone quote. Our quote is $1950.00. The guy who comes out, Tony tells us it looks like about twice the quoted and writes up a new quote. MORE THAN FOUR TIMES the original quote. I believe whole Hartley that this company is predatory in the sense that they know most people will be up against a tight dead line to move and will pay the outrageous money. I would bet they have never done a job for the quoted price.   Anybody reading this remaber when you get a quote that sounds too good to be true, it is.  Do not use this unethical company. I'm a small business owner and want to see other business thrive but this one deserves to go out of business.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Review>We started our move very rocky. Before we began packing we were looking for a moving company that would do our move and we weren’t pleased with the numbers we were receiving.  And then we received a call from Kangaroo Van Lines and what a treat that was. They gave us a breakdown of everything, costs, extra expenses (if necessary), and time frame. They were so patient with what we were looking for. We thought while on the phone they were going to give us a very harsh price like all the other companies but they gave us a price that beat all the other companies we called. So we booked our job. When it was time to move the movers came and helped us with everything. We packed already most of it but they were happy enough to help us pack the rest. It was honestly a great experience. The best part was we received everything just the way we left it with them. Overall, great experience and a great company.< /Review><Rating>5</Rating>< date>

My fiancée contacted Kangroo about a quote for moving to a different state. Ryan called her while she was at work. She stated I’m at work I can not talk right now please call me later and hung up. Ryan then texted her stating don’t be rude and disrespectful as you asked us too call.

This is horrible customer service and harassment. How is this ok? Customer said they are at work and you text them and harass them?

We recommend not using this service as possible and uhaul are a better option.

Wishing I could post the text message screenshot...<//Review>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Review>My spouse and I moved back to the US from England with our dog in the middle of a global pandemic, but somehow our experience getting a packed up storage unit from Chicago to Florida with Kangaroo was the worst part of our entire relocation. The sales person was friendly and responsive, but as soon as we paid our deposit (to the day) the communication stopped. We were told in writing that our pickup date was on a Sunday, but that day comes and goes with no call and no one answering their phones or emails, only to be told Sunday evening that our pickup was actually the next day. Consistently told from there that we'd be called on X day to confirm the driver had departed; never once were those dates met and never once did we receive a call that that deadline would be missed. One of the excuses we were given for a specific 4-day delay was that "the holiday" caused the delay- that "holiday" was father's day, and I can't recall any other process on this globe that has a delay because of father's day. The driver called on a Saturday to tell us he'd arrive Monday between 2-4; at 3:50 on Monday he calls to say it will be "some time tomorrow." Dates stopped meaning anything to us when they were communicated by this company. For a while we thought their lower price was worth the horrible service we were receiving, until they started racking up cost after cost with no explanation and no proof, and had us pay under duress unless we wanted them to hold our belongings hostage. We have items missing and items broken, which is always a risk, but we aren't feeling very confident that their claims process will make any of it right.

TL; DR: You couldn't pay me to work with Kangaroo Van Lines again.</Review>< rating>

<Text>If I could give a negative star, then I would. Worst experience of my life. Canceled a cross country move on us same day and never even called to let us know. Truck simply never showed up. When we asked to reschedule they refunded our money and say these things happen all the time. They caused us to have to change all of our plans last minute and spend double our original price with someone else to get the job done. This business needs to be closed. Already submitted a complaint to the better business bureau. Please don't put yourself through working with them, whatever you do! Their sales department is great but you will never be able to talk to them again once they get a deposit out of you. Don't be fooled!!!</Text>< pictures>

This company by far was one of the easiest and worry free moves my family and I have experienced.We moved from Los Angeles to Miami and it was super easy. We hear about people with belongings being damaged or lost but with Kangaroo, nothing at all. They helped us pack items that we couldn't do ourselves at no extra cost. Not only that they were very friendly and professional. We received our belongings on time with no damage and nothing missing. Overall, amazing experience. Wouldn't recommend any other moving company.< /review>

All of my electronics were damaged, some designer luggage was also damaged and I was missing 2 boxes with all of my sonos speakers that I physically watched the mover pack. Its funny that that box wasnt on the manifest and now its missing. The CEO says "Not my F$%^  problem buddy" and hung up on me. I did purchase insurance through a third party of which will be covered. The day the driver was suppose to deliver my things no called no showed for 5 days and then just popped up. Yes I did file a police report in addition to contacting the local news in both LA where they are located and Atlanta where I live and files a consumer reports claim along with the US Department of Transportation, All Social Media Avenues including Tik Tok, Facebook and it has already been shared 52 times through my friends and family. I strongly suggest you do the same. Chris the CEO is unprofessional, Ryan Hewitt is worse and David from Dispatch too is horrible. The packers packed my IMAC in a box of dishes, then place my knives in a box of pillows. Who does that? I have moved with companies before in the past and this company is by far the worst. My employer used another moving company to move the rest of his employees and informed his partners with other tech companies to do the same. This company is HORRIBLE!!!!< /review>< Date>

A MUST READ IF YOU’RE CONSIDERING KANGAROO VAN LINES:

My customer experience was so disappointing.
Before doing business with Kangeroo Van Lines,  my first mistake was that I believed the few positive reviews.

There’s “Actual Confusion” in force because the positive reviews were like for Kangaroo Movers.  Don’t get them mixed up.  The Kangaroo Movers brand has an outstanding reputation.  Kangaroo Van Lines is not Kangeroo Movers.  Stay away from Kangaroo Van Lines.  A lot of the positive reviews were likely intended for Kangaroo Movers.

My wife and I thought we’d save a few Benjamin’s and found out the hard way that you get what you pay for. One Kangeroo Van Lines employee on the phone was rude to my wife in a way that I never would have tolerated if I were in the room with him.  All my wife wanted to know was why we had to call them to find out we were rescheduled from 7:30 am in the morning to 7:30 pm at night.  She felt that they should have communicated the change proactively.  We were trusting them with our lifetime belongings.

They were radio silent all the sudden when we needed them most.  Who treats customers like that?  In this competitive economy, there was no support, no training, no service, and no patience or common courtesy.  I blame this on poor leadership.  This company won’t survive this new age in customer service.

Kangaroo Van Lines was twelve hours late.  The truck they sent with three possible contracted employees arrived at the storage facility business next door instead of the storage company I use.  I had to go find them and direct them to the right facility.  In retrospect, I should have taken a picture of this foreman and crew when I found them.  A picture speaks a thousand words!

I didn’t realize it at first but the Kangeroo Van Lines driver and worker didn’t seem to understand me.  At first, it was hard to explain to them that they were at the wrong storage business location.  Finally, the foreman got out of the truck to help. He understood me and translated.  They eventually drove over from the other storage company to the right place.  Not sure how they missed the rendezvous point in the first place because I texted to be sure they had the right address.

There were three movers, including the foreman.  When they got there, all I could hear from the foreman were excuses.  One of many excuses was that he had other cargo and not enough space.  I think the late hour, long day and darkness took its toll in these three.

I asked if he could take what Kangaroo Van Lines had agreed to from his list until the truck was full.  I just wanted to get our sofas, beds and essential into our new home first.  We were excited after a long wait due to renovations and a few unexpected plumbing repairs.  I would have settled for anything.  Anyway, this went back and forth.

I finally realized that the Kangeroo Van Lines team sent were just unmotivated and looking into a dark packed storage unit with dismay.  They obviously didn’t want to load anything into the truck. They had an inventory of what we agreed on that should have been loaded early that morning instead of late evening.  They decided not to load it at all.

Then, I directly asked the foreman why he didn’t show up when scheduled?  You see,  I took off work three hours to be there during the arrival time window that Kangaroo Van Lines provided prior to the reschedule they did.  He immediately started with excuses and claimed my wife didn’t confirm when he texted her.  That’s when I realized that dishonesty was at hand.  That’s not her way.  We are a coordinated couple so I know this was a fabrication.

On top of that, we had been told early that morning by a rude employee that the truck broke down in route. Coordinate your excuses guys.

In closing, my opinion is why gamble on hollow promises.  Keep looking for reliability, integrity, and service.  Simply put, you’re  taking your chances here with Kangaroo Van Lines.  Don’t get them mixed up with the stars at Kangaroo Movers.  Kangaroo Van Lines will be a mistake!< /Review>

I used Kangaroo to move from LA to Miami and honestly I couldn’t have been happier. The stress of a cross country move was consuming me and from the initial contact over the phone to the final moments when they left my new home they made sure I was at ease. Everything was moved gently and efficiently and nothing was broken. The guys were also very kind and professional and packed everything up in a couple of hours.  I had a fantastic experience, they made my stressful errand an absolute breeze. I really appreciate your help, thank you Kangaroo!<//review>

<Review>Missing furniture and misrepresentation of cost:

﻿Without success, I repeatedly attempted to contact the customer service department at Kangaroo Van Lines, as well as my initial primary point of contact to seek resolution of the following matters.

During the course of my move, the cost escalated to more than double the amount quoted.

Additionally, I am deeply dissatisfied with the series of miscommunication, which contained false and conflicting statements and incorrect expected arrival times.

Further, one piece of antique furniture was lost in transit. I contacted the driver, but he never returned my call as promised.<//Review><user_name>Keith Flint</user_name><Pics>None</Pics><user_id>103279426761885065874<//user_id>< date>

Let me start off by saying that I’ve never used a moving company before. I was a bit nervous to do so, I called around talking to different companies to get a feel for what I would be dealing with and I was getting more worried. My last call was to Kangaroo Van Lines and talked to a gentleman by the name of David. It was good to know that this was an American family-owned company. Instantly my fear and worries were gone. He helped me every step of the way and was very straight forward on how moving companies work. On the day of pick up the crew handled all my items with care and were very friendly and professional. I had some specialty items that I needed extra care for (Family heirloom) and needless to say it was treated like an expensive piece of artwork that needed to be on display the next day at the Getty museum. I’m not one to leave reviews even if I like a company, but everyone was so nice and really looked out for me during such a stressful time.<//text>

<review>DO NOT USE Kangaroo Van Lines.  I CAN'T STRESS THIS ENOUGH.  PLEASE READ REVIEWS LOTS of BAD Reviews.   This is the WORST company.  I went through the entire claims process and refused their little settlement just so I could post this.  I hope by me posting this people will STOP using  Kangaroo Van Lines.  I am trying to find out about class action suit after I read other reviews. They don't do as they say.  PLEASE DO NOT USE THEM.    I went through their claims process at the end.  WHAT A JOKE.... I had complaints and issues with the charge for SHUTTLE fees and they wouldn't even address it. The managers won't even return phone calls.  The Binding agreement stated one thing and I had been reviewing and working with that for a full month, with all the fees, then when the packers came and packed, I didn't realize I signed another agreement that had the same items, but different fees, SO WATCH out for this.  For example the Shuttle service on the binding agreement for the entire time I was working on the front end, stipulated $250 first 500 cu ft and .50 for every addt'l cu ft, well the contract that they make you sign in a rush when they are picking up re-iterates everything, but the costs are not the same . The cost on shuttle fee, ended up being $700 for the first 500 ft, and .75 for ea addt'l cu ft, so PLEASE WATCH and pay attention prior to signing.  Everyone of their fees on the BINDING AGREEMENT DID NOT MATCH what was on the contract they force you to sign upon pickup.  I reviewed my BINDING CONTRACT the same day on line that morning and the figures were as I had seen for the past month that I was working with the salesmen.  NO MENTION or any warning prices would be different  The people picking up for Kangaroo supposedly are employees of Kangroo and all the forms replicate they are from Kangroo, so why would one think any change of cost would be different.  They snuck that cost in which should be illegal.  Also, delivery was another huge issue, i was advised my belongings would be arriving between 12-14 JUN. Then they don't even call.  Here it is on 14 JUN, I am wondering where the delivery is.  I call and they said, oh, we had to make changes, we will send you an updated delivery schedule.  That never came until I called the 3rd time.  I finally got it and had another window, 23-25 JUN, well the 24th came, still no call as to when the driver would show up on 25 JUN.  They said the weather is holding him up and complications.  Every day, no word, I was having to call daily to try and get an update.  They gave me drivers# and the driver would not give me a date either, he said it depended on complications.  Finally on 1 JUL, I was informed that he would be here on 2 JUL.  Upon delivery, they did not unpack as promised, items such as TV, didn't put bed together all the way, didn't unpack wall clock nor our pictures that were special rapped.  ANOTHER ITEM TO BE CAREFUL, PER CONTRACT, YOU MUST ANNOTATE ALL DAMAGE ON THE DELIVERY PAPER PRIOR TO SIGNING IT.  Well if the truck driver refuses to unpack, how can you write all the damaged items prior to the driver leaving.  The truck driver wants to leave and is rushing you to sign and states you can annotate later.   What a bunch of hog wash.. Also, when I attempted to contact a manager, this company REFUSED to let me speak to a manager.  This is how BAD this company is when the manager will not even get involved.  They said they were a family owned business and care about their customers.  Yeah Right!!!  PLEASE DO NOT USE.  I never normally write bad comments about companies, but this one was so bad that I want people to know prior to getting in the same situation I did.   AGAIN STRONGLY ADVISE DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

This has been the worst cross country move experience I’ve ever had. It has been 18 days since they picked up our items and 9 days since our requested delivery date. No one seems to have any idea how or when our items will ship from Kangaroo’s storage facility in our origin city. We’ve been told by different representatives that our things were loaded a week ago, then corrected that no, they’re still in storage but will load the next day, and as of today are still sitting there (45 hours of driving away from our new location). At this point Kangaroo won’t be able to fulfill delivery within their contractually obligated 2-week window. I’ve been disregarded and spoken to rudely when I’ve asked for updates. I’ve received promises from multiple representatives that they’ll call me back with an update same-day, and I have yet to receive a call back. I am exasperated and exhausted by the need to dog this company and their tardiness and seeming disregard for their customers.<//review>

This was the best moving experience that I have ever had. They took the time to give me an in home estimate and reassured the safety and transport of my belongings. Their head sales person, Chris, kept me informed with every step of my move. This small business really has the personalized experience that I was looking for.</review>

original quote was $1400 . Final bill was $2900. Uses different companies to complete the job.

Showes up not when scheduled  at either times and cant communicate with dispatch and the drivers.

At no point wil you be in control of your move or be able to stop them from racking on massive cost changes. They will either leave you sol on moving day after changing there minds after a deposit is paid for and an agreement maid, or threaten to keep your things upon delivery if you dont pay the movers addiby the foot to move the stuff after there failures to communicate or plan result in thereextra work.

And yes my extra work as well. If this is how they treat disabled Veterans i hate to see how they treat people who they dont like.

Definitely feel like i was extorted and robbed by duress. Nothing like squeezing a small business owner for ever cent he dosnt have during a pandemic.</text>

<text>By far the worst company I have had to deal with.  Significantly late on the delivery.  Delivered 3 weeks later than promised.  The cost was literally twice the cost of the phone estimate, and waited until the truck was loaded to provide update.  Contract hides loop holes to prevent protection for the customer.  We had to call every day for the full 3 weeks to get updates, they did not follow through on any promise or estimate.< /text>< rate>

<Text>I booked Kangaroo Van Lines for my move from New York to Los Angeles, as they were referred to me by a friend who had previously used them. I'm so glad i did, not only did my furniture arrive in perfect condition in only 8 days (they quoted me 7-14 days), the movers themselves actually placed everything on arrival, exactly where i needed it. The consultant was more than helpful, too, keeping me updated on all the logistics of my move along the way. I will definitely use them again, and highly recommend them to anyone planning a move interstate. Naomi :)< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

used this company back in July for my move from Vegas to LA. The movers were very professional and friendly, helped us even pack some items we couldnt pack ourselves only charging for material and not labor. We got our items on time unlike many stories I hear about moving companies so overall I have to say I am very satisfied by them. Highly recommended<//Text>

All of these people are Vilians.  Moving day came and went. They show up and want more money than i was quoted then they had a BLANK contract for me to sign and refused to fill it out. Whose signs a blank contract!?! This is a shady company. Nothing  but con artists.  Unprofessional and inexperienced. Chris is a criminal and he will take all your money. He has nothing but lies and exuses. He hung up on me and will not call back. They kept some of my money and won't give it back. Nothing but Sharks preying on moving people. Terrible. These people are jokes. Don't waste your money or your time. Any other moving company would be better.< /text>

Used these guys to move from Las Vegas to Medford Or. DO NOT USE THEM FOR ANYTHING.
The first driver showed up was racist from Iran. He was standing in my garage saying things like Iran is the best and viva Iran. Then he had the nerve to tell me that it was going to double in price. When I called the office, they told me that they would take care of things which they didn’t. When I called to ask when my belongings were going to arrive they told me that I had to pay more to get to the 80% they needed before they would deliver everything.
After getting my things, I called about the over cost and that things where missing. All these a holes told me was to fill out the paperwork. Printed off paperwork and call company for information that I need in order to complete this form and here it is November now and they still haven’t returned any of my calls.
AGAIN DO NOT USE THESE GUYS FOR ANYTHING</text>

I used kangaroo van lines to move my items and my vehicles to California. They were about an hour late for the pick up but other than that the service was flawless! I got my belongings in the amount of time they promised and they even reassembled my beds for free. Top tier company and I would highly recommend them. Thanks kangaroo van lines I’m well moved in and it’s bern a pleasure doing business with your company.</Text>

<Text>I am extremely unhappy with this company
I am moving fro California to Chicago.  My arrival date and the date my stuff was supposed to be here was June 3. It is June 10 and my items are not on a truck out of California yet. They keep telling me they have  21 day window but does it make sense that it wouldn't even be on the way? They have had the stuff in storage since beginning of May so the should have had opportunities to get a truck out by now! In addition my original quote of 2600 has already gone to over $4100 at pickup and I fully expect it to go higher.  DON'T USE THESE GUYS!!< /Text>< pics>

Overall great experience, made my moving from Los Angles to Dallas as easy as it gets. The guys are great, assisting us along the entire process. We were happy to see how nicely the treated  our goods. Only small misunderstanding is when the truck was an hour and half late upon devilry date. But as I said before great services, nice people, would recommend!< /Text>

Hired them to move from Northern California to the Indianapolis area,  asked to be picked up at the beginning of our 3 day window and were told it was a 80-90% chance they would be there when we wanted. The driver called and told me he was scheduled for Saturday,  the last day of the window.  We weren't happy but couldn't do anything about it.  Mind you I booked a month out. Delivery is apparently a different matter,  they picked up on July 27th we put and availability on the paperwork of the 29th. It is August 19th and our stuff is still waiting to be sent to us from their warehouse.  We have called and were told 10 business days,  then 14, then 21 so at this point I have no idea when our stuff will be here. Avoid using them if you want your stuff in a timely manner.< /Text>

<Review>This company was very unprofessional. We had a confirmed date for pick up. I had an email confirming day and time, and a second email confirming the day with a change in times. The email clearly said "no further action was needed from me." On the day of the move they said our pick up had not been confirmed via phone so they moved us 5 days later. When I said I had not received any call, they said they had tried calling. The pick up was set for a Saturday. On Monday when I could reach their customer service people, I confirmed that online they did have my cell phone number, but they never called it. I sent a screen shot showing the confirmation email and of my account with the correct phone listed. They admitted a "glitch" in there system where I could see and their account rep could see the phone number but the logistics people could not. Their glitch, but my problem. Even when I explained that escrow closed on Monday and we no longer owned the house, they still did not send a mover until Wednesday. They tried to offer me a pick up earlier....at 1:00AM. What kind of business thinks a middle of the night pick up is acceptable, and by that point it was still 5 days later. The company service rep tried to make things better by offering $500 back. They said all I had to do was sign their form. When I got the form it was a release of all liability. Seriously? Not one single item had even been picked up, loaded or delivered but they wanted me to sign off all liability. Just another one of their very shady practices. Items were finally picked up, delivered 14 days later and in good shape. I doubt I will ever get any compensation from this company. I would not recommend them based on their "glitch" and doing nothing to make it right.</Review>< GmapID>

< review>
The salesperson, specifically Chris Brown, offered a lot of promises and talk but didn’t follow through on one. At the front end that left me in danger of getting ticketed, and the poor guys doing all the work had to carry a lot of heavy stuff up a steep driveway in Arizona heat. At the back end it took days to get a clear arrival date. They used a semi, which needed 48 hours’ notice to park, even though they clearly promised they would not. My requests for additional information, my email of concern about the whole process, my frequent calls to Chris (“I’ll be by your side every step of the way”) Brown all went unanswered. The movers and office staff work their butts off while the salesperson makes false promises, doesn’t deliver, disappears.  And probably still gets his commission. Watch out for this company.< /review>

I wasn't thrilled with the shopping experience. I was looking for a new dressy blouse and there wasn't a big selection. Mostly, casual and tshirts. Also looking for a graduation gift, but not much for ideas there. Shelves were kind of bare. For being a new store, I was not impressed.< /review>

<Text>This store is organized and shout out to the cashier who helped me with my return today at 5:30pm. She is very nice. We bought lots of stuff and need a big bag to carry them out since they do not allow carts outside. She ran to the other station to get me a bag while her team leader who wore a plaid overall and black t-shirt and glasses seemed to be very mean. That lady kept insisting that there is no more big bags even though it’s obviously they have them at the other station. Oh well, at least my cashier is nice.</Text>< Pictures>

I like this Ross, I frequent it when I'm on my lunch hour. It is, busy at that time but they usually open additional registers.The store is pretty clean and the ppl working are helpful. The only thing I would change is asking ppl to step back and maintain distance while shopping 🛍 🙃< /Text>

I truly Love this credit union. VALLEY STRONG CREDIT UNION was introduced to me by my credit card and I have to say it was truly the best decision I've ever made. I don't see myself ever leaving this credit union whatsoever. What stands out to me the the superb service I receive every time I call in or inquire for other services.
I do want to give a BIG Thank You to Daisy Gomez in the lending department. Daisy defines customer service and Professionalism. I wouldn't have taken there services if it wasn't for Daisy outstanding service. THANK YOU VALLEY STRONG!!!<//Text>

<text>I recently applied for a car loan through Valley Strong.  I had no expectations due to a recently discharged bankruptcy.  My current vehicle wasn't reporting my payments anymore and needed a new car to do just  that.  Mara H. was the representative that assisted me through the loan process.  To my surprise, I was approved for a set amount.  I purchased my new 2021 Toyota Corolla LE at North Bakersfield Toyota.  The dealership contacted Valley Strong about my loan and they were to up the amount I was approved for.  Thank you so much Valley Strong and thank you Mara.</text>< pictures>

I applied for a car loan over the phone. The loan was approved very fast. As I was on a time line to purchase a commercial vehicle after being in a car accident which totalled out my van. The Loan processor name was Daisy. She emailed me my pre approval letter.  The vehicle I purchased was out of town. The dealer contacted the bank  while the paperwork was being processed.  My loan process at the bank called me while my wife and I was at the dealership to make sure everything was going smooth. That was quite impressive.  My  interest rate was even lower than my original quote. I highly recommend Valley Strong for all your financial needs. To make it even better I was given the option of no payments for 90 days. I have purchased several new cars in my life.  This was the best service I have ever received! Thank you Daisy and the Valley Strong team for doing a excellent job!<//review>

Customer Service 5/5

DataNet Execution 1/5

Makes no sense why they're terrible with money management especially when using Bill Pay for example. Most modern banks "lock" or withdraw instantly. They wait until AFTER the check has posted before they take it.< /text>

< Review>
*If you're Active Duty military: STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.*

Their supposed "staff" has misled me several times about getting a wire transfer from home to my duty station and did not mention to me that INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS were not permitted while I am overseas. I am struggling here to get all of my things settled at my duty station because I thought I could trust this branch to fit my needs. Little did I realize how much of a mistake that was.

Awful. This is how they treat military and will probably treat Vets no differently!</Review>

Worst phone automated systeam in kern county. this credit union is normally has the longest waiting line in kern couty because they only have 3 bank tellers.  The home loan department has plenty of loan offers but non of them like to pick up the phone, you will be on hold for 10 minutes at a time just to be transferred or hang up on.</text><rating>1</rating>< response>

One....by making it up...I guess it’s like they say here ..your in Bakersfield..where if it sucks, break down ,it’s part of life of living here..glad I’m moving out of town.< /text><pics>None</pics>< Date>

From the moment I walked in I felt comfortable. I loved the aesthetic of the office with a beautiful fish tank to soothe me and animal pictures on the walls. The dentist took a close look at my teeth and jaw like never before. His assistant was kind and friendly. The receptionist was a perfect example of customer service. And the dental hygienist passionately encouraged me to floss more, which I will do. Wow my teeth feel clean and my mind easy knowing I’ll have nice teeth forever!</text>

I was referred to Dr. Shindler office by a close friend, since I was new to the area and in need of dental help. I found his office to be lovely, spotless, and set in a gorgeous location. More importantly, his staff is welcoming, knowledgeable, and friendly, from the moment you call and all throughout your visit. Dr. S is very precise, takes copious notes when you first meet and makes you feel as if he has all the time in the world to pay attention to whatever your situation might be. He's also extremely gentle. I need to thank my friend for this referral! I will absolutely refer this wonderful gentleman and office to others, as well<//Text>

Everyone has a smile on their face.</review>< pictures>

<review>Dr. Shindler and his staff are competent, professional and friendly.  In this COVID environment, their office is equipped with sanitizer equipments, air filters and PPE.  They take the patient’s and their staff safety seriously. I feel confident of my safety when I go to their office. Dr. Shindler and their staff always wear PPE, N95 masks, face shields and disposable gowns. They adhere to the safety protocol.< /review>< pictures>

I have been a patient of Philip Shindler for at least five years ... probably longer.  He is efficient, conscientious, and super proficient in every area of dentistry in which I have been in his care.  Recommend him highly!< /review>

< review>
An amazing dentist. I have been seeing Dr. Shindler for Invisalign in order to straighten teeth I have been self-conscious about my entire life. His work, care, and attention gave me results beyond my dreams. I can smile now. I originally thought my case was beyond help but Dr. Shindler has proven otherwise. His office works with me around my busy and hectic schedule and have been more than accommodating in getting my appointments in at a time that works for me.<//review>

I have been a patient of Dr. Shindler for many years. Since the outbreak of COVID 19 I was very hesitant to go to the Dentist. After overcoming, I was so pleased. Dr. Shindler has taken every precaution to keep his clients safe. He has brought in state if the art technology to insure a safe experience. Glad I went.< /Text>

I’ve  been a patient of Dr. Shindler’s for a few years now. He was recommended by my oral surgeon after my long-term dentist retired.  His dentistry is focused on sound dentistry with aesthetics
and cost effectiveness at its core.  Daisy, his hygienist, always does an excellent job of cleaning my teeth. The office is well organized I rarely have to wait more than just a couple of minutes for my scheduled appointment.</text>

I just went for my regular dental cleaning on Tuesday. I wasn’t sure how safe it was for me to go through my appt, because of the Covid 19 pandemic, but Dr Shindler’s Office made me feel safe because they were in compliance with the safety recommendations to protect patients from COVID-19. Taking temperature, hand sanitizers, wiping down areas after use, using masks and even an air filter to breathe cleaner air. I recommend them!</text>

My family and I have been coming to Dr. Shindler and his team for over 20 years (!) having a broad variety of work performed. I have been happy with the results and feel that we've been in good hands. The hygienists are each suburb and appointments, billing, etc. are made easy by the devoted staff.<//Text>

<Text>I have been coming to Dr. Shindler since I was a kid and have always had a fantastic experience at his office. Even though I now live in downtown LA, he is super flexible with appointment times so it’s no problem for me to drive over around my work schedule. His staff is so warm and friendly - it feels like a family in there! I’ve had various things done from cleanings to cavities, and Dr. Shindler never fails to make each experience as comfortable as possible. My family and I plan to keep coming here for many more years!< /Text>< pictures>

Dr. Schindler and team were amazing! All very nice and helpful. I came in to town to visit family and had severe tooth pain. They took me last minute, at the very end of their day. The assessment determined I needed to be sent to a specialist to which they helped get me in to that office the next day. Thank you Dr. Schindler and team!!< /Text>

<Review>When I moved to California a couple years ago, I was looking for a knowledgeable dentist who knew his or her stuff.  I have been fortunate to have had a couple really great dentists in my life and Dr. Shindler is one of them.  He has an enthusiasm for his craft and stays on top of the latest that is out there.  He takes a thoughtful approach to cavities, etc. I ran him through a bunch of questions when I started and he responded without being irritated.  I have also recommended him to a few colleagues and friends and they are impressed with his knowledge as well.< /Review>< Pictures>

Dr. Shindler has been my dentist for the past five years. He has been very accommodating for my hectic work schedule. Just recently, when I had a dental emergency, his front staff was able to squeeze me in during his busy schedule.  I highly recommend him for anyone looking for a new dentist!< /text>

< review>
I first met Dr. Shindler and his staff a few yrs back on a Sunday. It was a 911 type of situation and he was the only one willing to open up his office to help me out. I've been going back to him ever since! The staff which you will quickly get to know on a first name basis is kind and genuinely seem to care about you as a friend and not just another patient. Every procedure is always explained carefully and gone about in a gentle way. I've never come out of this office in more pain than I came in with. If you are one of those that's afraid of the dentist I strongly recommend that you go see Dr. Shindler. They are the best.</review>

I highly recommend Dr. Shindler. I have been his patient since the crown on one of my front teeth fell off six year ago on a holiday weekend. He took care of my emergency dental work even though his office was closed. I found Dr. Shindler to be very professional and his work top quality.

When another one of my old crowns fell off last week I couldn’t believe it. I immediately called Dr. Shindler, again it was a holiday weekend, but he met me at his office and once again took care of my emergency.

I am grateful to have found such a wonderful, friendly and caring dental office.</text>

Dr. Shindler is a great dentist and true professional. I have been with him for over 20 years and regardless whether it is a simple procedure or an implant,  he calls you personally at night to make sure I am okay.  His entire staff is very efficient and friendly and you are not kept waiting. Getting your teeth cleaned by Daisy or getting a cavity filled is a positive experience even though my teeth have been a struggle all my life. The office team lead by Beverly or assisted by Nicolette is always positive and charming. Really a rare finding when it comes to dentistry!! I just can’t say enough when it comes to this dental practice. If you are fearful of dentists..... and I am. Go to Dr. Shindler because I know he will be gentle and is skillful with the most modern technology.<//Review>

<Text>I’ve been going to Dr. Shindler for over 15 years. He’s dedicated to giving his patience great care and he is professional and focused. His office is friendly and I’ve always had nice, gentle hygienists. I have some gum recession, so that’s very important to me.

Dr. Shindler has given me several crowns and has put fillings in hard to reach places in my small mouth. He has explained the difficulty to me and we work together, me pushing my jaw in opposite directions and him performing his tasks with precision. My periodontist recently did xrays and praised Dr. Shindler for what he could see of his work in those xrays.

I would highly recommend this dentist to you!<//Text><time>1578690670679</time>< Pictures>

Dr. Shindler and his staff are AMAZING!! I was SO lucky and grateful to find out that they are open two Saturdays a month when I was in desperate need of pain relief!! When I called the office, the friendly, caring voice (belonging to Beverly) told me to come right on over and once there, Nicolette made me feel relaxed and comfortable. The moment I met Dr. Shindler (who came out into the waiting room to welcome me!!), I knew I was in kind, professional, experienced and expert hands! Absolutely NOTHING hurt during my root canal procedure, which truly is the mark of one of the best dentists out there!!!</text>

Dr. Shindler could not have been better to me, called him with an emergency broken tooth and exposed nerve, he accommodated me immediately withing just hours of me calling him and stopped my tooth pain right away. Would absolutely recommend him to anybody.<//text>

<resp>None<//resp><text>A family dentist that works very professionally:
I was NOT looking forward to getting a new crown today and was concerned about all the risk with COVID-19, but Dr. Shindler and his staff made everything so easy and painless! They have all the right equipment and procedures to make me feel very safe and worked perfectly like a professional, championship team (I really missed March madness in the NBA finals!)  His assistant knew exactly what he needed and they got the job done so quickly… From start to finish, a complete crown in less than 2 hours and I don’t have to come back  I was able to eat dinner a few hours later and the next day I didn’t even know it was there.  Regarding my previous cleaning appointment, it was very thorough work in just the right amount of time.  She was concerned about my comfort. Excellent finish work. I also learned something about dental hygiene nobody else told me!  As owner of a computer consultation and support business, my time is very valuable and it’s very hard for me to takeoff any amount of time during the workday to have someone work on my teeth and interrupt my schedule. It’s so good to have a dentist that appreciates my needs and performs excellent work in the least amount of time.</text></record></dataset><record>

I am so glad to be under his care.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80e824ef04104ec9:0xb6e6c565dc884cd1< /Gmap_id><Name>David Mansel< /Name><time>1511991458478< /time>< Resp>

<Review>I found Dr. Shindler off of yelp while looking for someone who could immediately and professionally help me with my dental emergency. I was immediately impressed by the great reviews on Dr. Shindler's page and I decided to drive an hour away, knowing I would be in rush hour traffic on the way home, to see for myself the excellent service.
It was everything I was expecting and more. Everyone is very straight forward about the entire process and polite and accommodating along the way. I have no regrets about sitting in traffic for an hour and a half on the way home because my experience was just so worth it.
The dentist is something we all generally dislike having to endure but I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with Dr. Shindler and his team. I look forward to future appointments with them for as long as I am in Los Angeles!!!

Thanks Dr. Shindler!!!</Review>< Pics>

It is always such a pleasant and competent visit for dental services with the team at Dr. Shindler's. Office is clean and state-of-the-art.  My family and I have been patients for 25 years. I still have a set of veneers put on way back then and they are serving me well--went from crooked front teeth and a hesitant smile-to a Hollywood smile!   GQ is next.< /Text>

Cannot thank Dr. Shindler enough. When I first visited him, he checked all my teeth and then gave me all the details about the treatments I needed. I was worried about the cost of the treatments, but he was offering financing options, which turned out to be really helpful for me. I will never leave this dentist.< /text>

I can’t thank Dr. Shindler and his staff enough!  I recently had a dental emergency on a Saturday morning, while visiting from Florida.  From my first contact with Beverly, I knew I was in great hands - very friendly, welcoming and helpful.  Dr. Shindler was extremely thorough and he and his staff (thanks Nicolette) made me feel comfortable, relaxed and well-cared for. I even left with a hand-written note from him to give my dentist at home.  Who does that? I highly recommend you have ANY dental treatment with Dr. Shindler and his team.  If the commute from Florida wasn’t so far I’d be a regular!</Text>

I was lucky enough to find Dr. Philip Shindler via 1800-Dentist when I moved to LA - which many might think- yikes! But I was working in Calabasas so hey were close to my office and home and they have wonderful reviews, so let's try 'em out. I have since moved jobs in the exact opposite direction but I have no desire to change dentists because I finally found a practice that I love! The staff is greatly helpful and the hygienists are well versed, informative and caring. Dr. Shindler is wonderful, smart, diligent, and always greets you with a smile! Thank you guys for outstanding service and helping me keep my pearlies white!!!<//review>

Food order:
Chicken fried rice
Orange chicken
General tso chicken
Pot stickers.

General tso chicken: the chicken felt like it's been bathing in the sauce for 5 hours. Tasted ok but definitely could be better.

Orange chicken: too sweet and also felt like it was bathed in the sauce for too long feeling soggy.

Pot stickers: they taste bland and the way they're made is just weird.

Chicken fried rice: so I ordered the food at 5pm it got to my house at 6pm. I didn't eat because I waited for my family members to get home. About an hour and a half later the food was cold so we reheated it a bit and I took a bite out of it and immediately threw up. It tasted horrible. Like nothing I've ever tasted before. I saw and it had this stringy texture to it.

I've eaten at many chinese restaurants in my life from NY, FL and some here in Cali.

But this is by far the worst place I've ever ordered food from. It makes panda express look like a place where deity's travel across universes to enjoy pure authentic Asian cuisine found no where else in the world.

I only gave it one star because I can't give it zero. If I could I'd give it a negative 3.<//Text>

The CP value was very high, considering their price. Foods were decent, acceptable and edible, like what you expected from a family restaurant with a sole Cantonese chef. But I would stay away from dishes with shrimps.<//text>

Food here used to taste good. But now, the fried rice is not so tasty and shrimp got wat smaller and the salt and pepper fish is a complete rip off. All breadings no fish inside. Therefore i wouldn't recommend this place anymore.</text>

I was waiting for somebody to take my order for 15 min. I thought maybe they are busy with the pickup orders, but then three people entered after me and immediately one guy came out from the kitchen and started to take their orders. After taking those guys orders he simply ignored me and I decided to leave. I was like WTF!!! I was wearing a red jacket, maybe they (asian) can't see that color.< /Review>

This was 3.5 stars.  An economical ($9) lunch with decent tasting cashew chicken and green beans.  It did seem to have an unhealthy dose of oil, however.<//review>

<review>I don't think this is a good restaurant. Why the score is still high?
1. Noone set up kit when we sited.
2. No water or hot tea served after waiter asked.
3. The food is made kind of rough. Vegetable not chop into small piece. The food is salty. Even we feedback this issue to boss, he only reply I can offer a knife to you.<//review><UserId.>107050045596661606205< /UserId.><username>Louis Chang</username>< Date>

We drive OTR and was on a delivery when we ordered lunch it was the worst Chinese food I've ever eaten. We had sweet and sour chicken the chicken was dry and the cherry sauce was terrible.The fried rice was nasty.Would not recommend this place at all.</review>

(Translated by Google) It tastes good, the friend is very friendly, the menu is very flexible, you can order the dishes you want to eat. But the place is not clean.

味道不錯，伙記很友善，菜單也很有彈性，可以訂你想食的菜色。但地方很不清潔。<//review>

What heart surprise. This place does outdoor dining better than most do indoors. Food is good, fresh and you get plenty.</review>

The seafood was good. The price of each dish was ok but they really came as very small quantity. So overall it was very expensive.< /Review>

< Review>
We had two sliders with fries and a side of extra slider (two mild flavors for hubby and the medium hot for me). They offer a free side with the Yelp check in & since I did the same nice guy gave us two kaleslaws which is my absolute favorite side they offer. All 5/5!

The only suggestion that I've for them is to offer delivery. That'll be more and more popular very soon!< /Review>

Came here with my Vietnamese homey and was not expecting this good of food. We had the grilled snails, blood clams, tamarind shrimp, and minched conch. All of it had a unique flavor from Vietnam and was fresh.</Text>

Good food, good service, although when crowded they don't look to see if you wave.  My biggest complain is that they are in a unsafe neighborhood and they didn't even invest in a camera system, or more lights around the parking lot.  Several cars got broken in before here.  Mine and another one was, last night.  And when asked if they have cameras they just simply said "no need".  So until they make some effort to improve the situation, I wouldn't come back, and recommend friends not to.  (5 stars for the good food, minus  2 stars for the experience)<//review>

I had the shaking beef . Which was a bit over cooked . The dipping sauce made up for it . Really spicy, so if you like it hot - it’s hot . The plate comes with lots of greens and veggies.

My friend had the Bùn Màn . This is fish paste noodle is not made for everyone. Over all it was good . The added sauce on the side give it a extra sour taste . Not recommended for those who have high blood pressure. And if you can’t stand the smell of fish sauce .

<Text>SO GOOD!

Usually a place with this expansive of a menu, including all the seafood dishes and snails, suffers in other areas... BUT my family and I were continually satisfied with every dish that came out. Tasted well prepared and authentic to our taste.

Great selection of snails and other seafood. "Nhau food" is what you can call it but my entire family from my parents to my niece/nephew liked many of the dishes. We ordered beers on the side and made it a very fun Saturday night dinner.

Will be returning for sure!< /Text><GmapID>0x808fcd6cd8c8bfc9:0xb28b666ea13065d<//GmapID><username>Huan Dong<//username>< resp>

Everything I've had here has been good or great. Razor clams are delicious when in season, but I wish there was more in the portion. Canh chua was seasoned well with lots of fish. Even egg rolls were pretty good. Crowd is what you should expect coming to East side.<//Review>

There are too many good restaurants in San Jose . Don’t come here.  The waiter and waitress doesn’t smile.  We ordered 4 dishes . bun man was good , the snail they gave us the wrong kind of snail . The shaken beef was so tough was the worse I ever tried. The 4 th dish never came . We waited for half hour and asked they said sorry they gave to the wrong table.  Anyhow ruined my Saturday meal. Not good experience .<//Text>

<Text>Great Menu selection of seafood and Vietnamese dishes.  We got several snail dishes. Oc huong, finger snails, little snails in curry sauce, Butter and garlic tiny snails, Fried chicken feet, snail salad and bo la lot. The portions are decent and everything tasted amazing.

We loved the experience here and will definitely come back. I recommend going earlier if possible because it definitely gets crowded at night.<//Text>< Pictures>

The food is good, but not cheap. We tried Xo Huyết mỡ hành. Very tasty but chewy. Same as Gỏi ốc. Surprisingly, lẩu dê is excellent. Very light and tasty. We asked for an extra vegetable dish and they charged us $5.<//Review>

Food is good.  Crowded, long wait time, but it's acceptable.  Beware of 18% gratuity charge for table of 6 or more people.< /text>

<Text>I’m a regular here and tend to order the same dishes every time. It’s just too consistent and things have gotten a lot better than before. Before there were long waits for seating, for our orders to be taken and for the food to come out. The man in charge known as K has really changed things around. It’s more packed, food comes out in a timely manner and service has improved tremendously. We always get served by K while the other staff members are running around taking care of the rest. K knows what we usually order and would suggest us trying different dishes he recommends and it’s good.  Will definitely be coming back and retaining my regular status here with these folks.

More to Vietnamese cuisine than a bowl of pho. What I would recommend here for a party of 3-4:
Canh chua - I would say is a staple in most Vietnamese homes. It’s the soup with catfish and tamarind flavors. Really delicious and is my favorite dish. You have to compliment it with a side of clay pot fish and pork and at this location, I would get one more to leave feeling full and satisfied. The fried chicken feet is really crunchy and great appetizer. The tamarind shrimp is different and delicious. The chicken feet salad is really delicious. Spice, sweet, sour and refreshing. The fried fish is really good!

Of course stick to the first options I mentioned for your first visit.  Go!< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

It's good here. We keep coming back.
She likes the clams, I like the TVs always showing the sports.
First walk inside and immediately notice the smell of serious sea good - its not McDonald's.
Hard floors, hard walls, so voices fill the room and is hard to hear your partner.
Service; they're busy here, so its food to order efficiently.
Food; quite good, ethnic and price seems fine.

It's our 7th visit< /Text>

As their name implies their specialties are duck dishes. These duck dishes are very good and I am pleased with their Gỏi Vịt and Bún Sáo Măng.

Bánh Bèo is surprisingly good as I did not expect such dishes available here.</text>

<Text>Have been going to this place for several years and notice the last few visits in 2018 both service and food quality have gone down dramatically.   We typically order "lau de" or "lau canch chua" and they both have been very salty and lack of taste.  We ordered "ruot heo chien gion" and it was very old and refried. Another dish was "long heo plate" and again the dish was so old with color on it.  When we gave the feedback, the lady manager did not acknowledge and not a word of apology for serving old, bad taste food.<//Text>< gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) Steamed clams are delicious and have eaten cinnamon leaves. Fried chicken wings have medium sauce, big oysters.

(Original)
Nghêu hấp lá quế ngon, vừa ăn. Cánh gà chiên nước mắm cũng vừa, hàu to.< /text>

We truly felt he was more concerned with our comfort than making a sale.  He recommended what was best for us, not what was most expensive.  We have purchased from Mattress Firm in the past and have always had very good customer service.  But this was definitely our best experience yet.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<Text>I came in dreading mattress shopping, but was pleasantly surprised by how easy the process was. I walked in and Isaac Klein promptly greeted me. We discussed the type of features I was looking for and began testing mattresses. The process was made very simple due to Isaac’s expertise. I basically just had to say yes or no!<//Text><name>Hope Seymour< /name></record>

Wes was super helpful and took us through many beds to find just the right one! It was refreshing being led into the right bed for us instead of just the most expensive one. He gave us a great deal as well. We will definitely be back!< /Text>

Isaac assisted our purchase and he was both knowledgeable and helpful. He made sure we became familiar with the many options that we had in selecting our new mattress. I really appreciate that he didn’t try to sell us on anything.  It was important to him that we made the best choice for us. If you choose Mattress Firm and Isaac, you will be in good hands.</text>

He was extremely knowledgeable, kind , considerate, patient, personal , and one of the best salesman I’ve ever had the pleasure to work with . He needs to have a raise as soon as possible because he is an asset to your company. I hate to say this but he is upper management material.(He would be greatly missed on the floor !! )My son recently bought a entire bed set from Andrew, and recommended him to my wife and I and my daughter. We all are delighted with his personal care . Can’t say enough about him . We will definitely get all our beds from Andrew. John and Olga Bennett.<//Text></record>

Found better quality memory gel foam mattress online. Way less expensive. I thought their prices were high. But Huge markups on mattresses. That's why you always see half off sales 😆< /Text>

I highly recommend buying from Mattress Firm on Jackson Drive, La Mesa, CA. Isaac Klein assisted me in purchasing a bed today. He was extremely knowledgeable about Mattress Firm's products but also knowledgeable about sleep and what is required in a mattress to obtain a good night's sleep. He created an interactive atmosphere that was professional and made you feel you could ask questions. Having had problems with my current bed I asked a lot of questions. In the process he was able to educate me and answer all of my questions.</Text>

From the moment I walked in to the moment I left, Keith made me feel so welcome and comfortable. I have been looking for a quality mattress for a while now and within an hour, Keith helped me find exactly what I wanted. He listened to everything I needed (from back support and something to accommodate my allergies during season change) and worked with me to find the perfect mattress. I am so grateful I chose this location to purchase my mattress from. All the staff was amazing, but Keith definitely made this experience the best! Definitely recommend this location. :) I can’t wait to sleep in my new bed!</review>

My wife and I went to Mattress Firm La Mesa to test the feel of the Nectar lush queen mattress. Wesley guided us through the process and helped us try out several types of mattresses on the adjustable base. We ultimately decided on the NECTAR LUSH model. The entire process was totally stress free and we received plenty of BEDUCATION from Wesley. Thank You Wes!< /text>

<date>1609713649450< /date><review>So I went to Bath bed and beyond to look for some pillows and the one that I really like was $104. I also went to Macy’s but they did not have what I want it. I went to mattress firm and the same pillow I saw for $104 I got two pillows for the same price. I got buy one get one free. So if you are looking for any mattresses or pillows always check at mattress firm they always have great deals. I also got a great deal on my mattress and my ajustable  bed.</review>< user>

This Saturday I set out to purchase my very first mattress. Isaac Klein made the process so amazing and fun! He explained so many of the reasons why to pick a certain mattress, base, and bedding. I had learned so many thing I never knew about mattresses and sleeping that I definitely think everyone should know! I picked the most comfortable and amazing bed I had ever felt. I literally had no idea that a mattress could feel so good. There was a calm but fun (and definitely no pressure) atmosphere, which made for a great buying experience. Thank you so much Isaac for helping me find my dream mattress!</text>

I never write reviews but this definitely deserves one. I was just planning on checking out some new mattresses at the La Mesa location and ended up leaving with an amazing hookup on a brand new Purple 3 Premier Hybrid Queen for $200 off. The jury is still out on the Purple Mattress however they threw in 2 Harmony pillows, Matress protector, and sheets over $500 value AND free delivery for Free. Ask for Keith or Isaac, they’ll take care of you.<//Text>

It took me forever to get to do my mattress shopping and I didn’t want to go from store to store. Drew and Melissa helped make my decision super quickly. The knowledge and patience they had only made my experience that much better. It’s good to know that a company like Mattress Firm actually TRAINS their employees to know what they’re talking about. Super happy and excited for my new bed and base!<//review>

My wife and I went shopping around for a new mattress and just didn't feel the sincerity of the sales person until we walked in to mattress firm. As soon as we walked in we were greeted and helped without any pressure by a great man by the name of floyd. Real respectful and professional and made our experience quick and easy. I would definately recommend mattress firm to anybody and everybody.. they have definately gained a lifetime customer< /review>

You guys are petty.  As if you ever have enough customers to fill your very large back parking lot to feel the need to place a fence between Soapy Joe's and your establishment.</Review>

<Review>Scott Kurtz was extremely helpful, very knowledgeable, and kind as well! I am moving to San Diego soon, but my girlfriend is already there, so my girlfriend and I decided to video chat one another and to both go to a local Mattress Firm to pick out a mattress, since that is a decision that we should make together. Scott immediately helped my girlfriend when she entered the store.

Scott's professionalism and charm shone through even though I was interacting with him through a cell phone, and he made it easy for me to find the mattresses that he was showing my girlfriend. My girlfriend and I were extremely satisfied AND had a ton of fun. I would definitely recommend Scott if you're in the San Diego area and looking to purchase a mattress!< /Review>< Pictures>

Isaac was all by himself and I was the only customer so we took our time. I was shopping for a bed for another room and was satisfied with the bed I already  had. He showed me options in what I already knew i wanted (hybrid). He was knowledgeable in sleep issues and I didn't feel pressured. Took an afternoon nap upon delivery and don't regret my purchase.</Review>

I never see more than one customer in the store at the time. Yet they want to be all greedy with their parking spots. Like your customers would even want to park on the side of the building with the car wash. Definitely will be buying a mattress online.</review>

Just bought my mattress here last night and I had the best customer experience. Will was extremely helpful and patient while I laid on just about every mattress in every show room 15 times over.<//Text>

Scott was amazing! We are so excited to get our mattress. I had back surgery a year ago and I just wish I had bought it sooner. No sales pitch just facts about what is right for you. Definitely would recommend Mattress Firm in La Mesa and working with Scott! Thanks again!</Review>

We’ve  had a great experience with Matress Firm in La Mesa.  Their sales staff didn’t try to over sell us when we were clear what our price range was.  We had to change the delivery date and place and was not an issue, they got it correct and were in and out very quickly.  We did end up changing mattresses after a couple of months and we had called during the pandemic.  They extended the time frame and when we went into make the change, there were no surprises.  It was exactly as it was explained initially and it was very easy.  They were very friendly and handled it very well.  Nick helped us with finding a mattress to better suit our needs very quickly and we were on our way in half an hour.  They have been awesome.  We’ll definitely be repeat customers<//text>

<text>When I walked in there were no customers in the store. The salesman was very nice and immediately greeted me. I told him what I wanted and how much I wanted to spend. I had done some research before coming into the store so I knew what I wanted to see. I showed him the pictures of the beds I wanted to try and he told me he had them in the showroom. He was very polite and not pushy at all. He did show me one mattress that was over my budget and I then stated I wanted to stick to my budget and not go over at all.
Overall, he was very nice and helpful. I will be calling the store back to make the purchase and set up delivery day and time.<//text><UserId.>113859490375552120264<//UserId.>< Rating>

We've gotten to the point, medically, where we need an adjustable bed - it is not a want.  This could also be our last bed purchase for a long time, so we wanted to make the right decision.  Isaac Klein was the one who helped us.  He is very knowledgeable and made very good recommendations.  We never felt like we were being forced to spend more money than we wanted to spend.  His customer service is also exceptional.  We left the store feeling very good about our purchase experience.< /text>

We have been tossing and turning for too long and we knew we needed to find a new mattress that worked for both of us. While we knew we were walking out with a new mattress and we were leaning towards tempurpedic because of friends reviews we had never  gone through an official mattress buying process. We walked into mattress firm in La Mesa and Issac warmly greeted us immediately. Throughout the selection process he was supportive and never once made us feel pressured at all to pick one brand over the other or purchase at all.  Once we selected our mattress he walked us through the delivery process and set expectations for the first few months of having a new mattress... the added discounts and next day delivery (mattress was in stock) didn’t hurt either. Overall we had a great experience with Issac and are excited to get our new mattress!!<//Text>

This was my second time at this location! I went here to just try the demo Purple mattresses, but ended up purchasing my new Purple 4 mattress from them! Wes was fantastic!! He answered all of my questions and made me a deal I couldn't refuse for the mattress, adjustable base and pillow, sheet and mattress protector set. Thank you very much for being polite, knowledgeable and overall fantastic!!! The customer service is unmatched here and just want you to feel at home. You all are the best, and Wes you are the best salesman I have encountered! Thank you!!!<//review>

<review>First time purchasing a mattress at Mattress Firm and I couldn’t be happier. I checked out a few places prior because I am pretty picky when it comes to beds. So I came into Mattress Firm with a good idea of what I wanted and Wes was very knowledgeable, patient, and super helpful when it came to finding me the perfect bed. I highly recommend coming here for your mattress needs and if you do, ask for Wes! He’s truly the best. Thanks again! I’m already in love with my new bed<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

UPDATE: We had the mattress delivered but apparently we didn't order a base. I refused the delivery and called Will to see what the issue with that was after I confirmed that no, there was no base on our receipt. He apologized and said he was sorry for not offering us the free adjustable base in their current promotion. In all honesty, he probably DID offer it but we were too focused on looking at beds and prices. We were also moving so we had a lot on our minds. We had it delivered again very quickly and it's wonderful. We sleep so well! Thank you for the quick fix that was probably our own fault lol</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80d957115bfc1861:0x76915fc9e828d141</gmapID></record>

Isaac Klein, the store manager was nothing short of awesome. He walked us through the options we had in mind and gave us some great discounts on a new purple mattress and full setup with the adjustable base and extra gifts as well. Customer service left myself and my girlfriend 110% satisfied and I would highly recommend this man for your mattress needs. Very friendly and helpful, he is the definition of excellence!!!

Thank you again Isaac!

<text>When I bought my matress it was a different manager in charge and everything was happy go lucky. The new manager, issac (I think) could use a good training in customer service. I will no longer use this company because of the interaction I had with him. Buyer beware, they are no longer about the customer.</text>< user_id>

Isaac was a thoroughly knowledgeable representative who took my wife and I through various mattresses, working with our sleep preferences and explained in great detail the benefits of each mattress we tried. We ultimately settled on a Tempurpedic mattress with an adjustable base as this best supports the back of both me and my wife. We've had the mattress for about a week now and have both enjoyed an extremely comfortable, restful night's sleep - something we really haven't had in a very long time. We did have to wait a week for the mattress to be delivered due to stock on hand, but once it arrived the deliverymen were professional, careful yet efficient in removing the old mattress / box spring and setting up the new adjustable base and mattress, ensuring the base operated as intended prior to leaving. Will definitely consider them again for our next mattress purchase (ideally well over 10 years as we expect the mattress to last at least that long) and I certainly would recommend Isaac as he works very well with any customer's requirements as it comes to a new mattress.</Text>

Went in to look at mattresses since my girlfriend wants to exchange her current one. Wes was extremely helpful in finding the best fit for her even though he knew there was no sell to be made since we bought the mattress at a different location. Extremely professional and excellent customer service. Thank you wes! Appreciate all the help.</review>

I had a great experience buying a bed at this location. Isaac was very helpful. Ultimately, the bed wasn't right for me. Isaac honored their 120 day warranty with no problems whatsoever. I kept the adjustable base, though. Their Mattress Firm 900 adjustable base is built like a tank. They also offer an optional 10 year extended warranty. I'm a big guy, and these factors made the purchase of this base from their shop a no-brainer.</review>

Had a great experience shopping at MattressFIRM today. Scott helped me from the get go, guiding me through price range and comfort, to get me into the perfect mattress. He was very knowledgeable, friendly, and professional. Even as short staffed as they were, he was able to dedicate the time I needed to get everything setup and scheduled for delivery in perfect timing for my new apartment. Highly recommend MattressFIRM and their sales associate Scott Kurtz.  Thanks Scott!</Text>

<text>Popped in 15 minutes before close(I dont usually do this) but Isaac helped me narrow my selection down quick.  I came in with the size and comfort in mind and he helped me to narrow in on price and availability, because I need it asap and as you know covid has thrown everything through the loop. He showed me what he had and i tested them and Lucky, for me the one i found online was in stock at the warehouse as well as it being transferred to la mesa from the moramar location. He hooked me up with a protector too.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1596748249200, 'text': "Thanks so much for the review, Vanessa Pacheco!

Had an awesome experience with Issac! He was very helpful and knowledgeable when it came to picking out a bed for our daughter. No high pressure sales and the customer service was great. We were in and out in less than 15 mins. Pickup was a breeze and Issac even carried the mattress out to our car. We were happy with the experience and the quality of the mattress. I'll be back for our next purchase.< /Text>

<review>Had the best experience in mattress firm. I decided what I wanted on the Internet but I wanted to check out the plush, medium firm, firm. Found out what I wanted wasn’t what I was going to purchase on the Internet. The reason I didn’t go in is because it takes too long. But not today, There was a great lady named Maria she helped me understand a little better about the firmness of the mattresses.
Best of all she did find me what I wanted with a Half Price Discount from the Outlet.
I was out of there within 15 minutes.
15 minutes Jack-in-the-Box can’t even do that. Great place and it’s across the street from Grossmont Center it is not in Grossmont Center. Plenty of parking with great service. Next time I have the money to buy a really really nice mattress or box springs or base I will be going there and asking for Maria. Thanks for taking such good care of us. And I got my mattress the next day. 🙀< /review>< pictures>

<review>In April I visited the Mattress Firm store and was assisted by Wes Sherwood.  I purchased my mattress and adjustable base at the end of May.  On the day of my delivery Wes gave me a call and offered advice on my delivery.  The attached is a copy of the email I shared with Wes regarding my experience.

Wes, I would like to say thank you for giving me a call on the day of my delivery. I appreciate you taking the time to give me a call and offer advice at time of set up. You are an excellent salesman. When I was in your store you were very professional, knowledgeable and thorough. You answered my questions and gave me information on the different mattresses I tried out during my lengthy visit to your store. You were very personable, without being pushy or persuasive. I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. The two gentlemen who delivered my furniture were also professional, polite and informative about the products I purchased.

Thank you Wes. You made this major purchase for me an easy one. Best of luck in your career with MattressFirm.

Great store!  Floyd was super helpful, knowledgeable & professional.  He took all the time we needed to try out a variety of brands & styles to best meet our needs.  He was very personable & made it a very positive experience.  The store was clean & bright.  Lots of mattresses to choose from.  Recommend this store to anyone looking for a great deal & friendly staff.  Make sure to ask for Floyd!< /Review>

We were in search of a NEW mattress that met
the needs of both my Wife and I. Here at Mattress Firm we found it! Isaac was incredibly helpful and knowledgeable. The buying card made the purchase simpler as well. We are very happy with the purchase and the staff.< /text>

Wes was a very helpful and attentive salesman! Made the process of buying our mattress smooth and enjoyable. He showed us all the mattresses we might like, the different deals, and different features of the mattresses. He really took his time to make sure we got what we wanted and at the price we wanted. We love our mattress.</Review>

<Review>Mattress buying here was so easy. We walked in and were guided to the hybrid mattresses per our request. We tried out the different brands while Tommy explained what features you need in a mattress. We purchased The Jennings Black hybrid plush mattress and they threw in two pillows and a mattress cover. Tommy was extremely helpful, not pushy, and a pleasurable person to deal with. Overall a wonderful, painless mattress buying experience!</Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<text>Very happy with the service we got from MF La Mesa and Issac.  He took the time to really find out what our sleeping preferences were and put together a great deal.  All without being overly salesy or pushy.  Very happy so far with our new bed purchase and would recommend to others.< /text>< pics>

<Text>My wife and I had a great experience at this Mattress Firm. The store is fairly large and has a good variety of mattresses, including Purple. We came to see what deals would be coming up on Black Friday and planned to shop around afterwards. So, we had already decided to leave the second we started getting hastled by any pushy salespeople. Luckily, we didn't have to worry about that at all. We talked with Will, who was incredibly friendly, personable and not pushy at all. He helped us figure out what type of mattress we liked and didn't pressure us towards more expensive mattresses (or pressure us at all, for that matter). In fact, Will did such an amazing job of helping us find what we were looking for at a great price that we decided to buy a mattress then and there. I would definitely recommend anyone in the market for a new mattress to come here, and bonus points if you get to work with Will!<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80d957115bfc1861:0x76915fc9e828d141<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Wesley helped me in the store pick out my mattress and adjustable bed. He is patient, knowledgeable and very thoughtful. He took time assuring I was getting the best one for my needs. Wil was very patient helping me with my online warranty. Floyd and Stephen drove over to my place after my mattress was delivered to help me with any adjustments, answer questions, ad ease my frustration and confusion with the height adjustments. It is extremely unusual and quite amazing that they came over to rescue the confused lady with her new bed. I will never buy another bed anywhere else as long as I live. Mattress Firm La Mesa  has a customer forever. Good, kind, patient, humble, and knowledgeable men with integrity and outstanding  values work at that store.  You can be sure you will  treated well and receive the help you are looking for in selecting a mattress. Thank you and blessings  to the A team at Mattress Firm La Mesa.</text>< pictures>

My fiancé and I were very hesitant on going to a store to buy a mattress because I like firm and she doesn’t. My back will go out on a soft mattress. We went to Mattress Firm on our way home from shopping and had a wonderful experience. The associate named Shawn Coey was the most informative associate. He answered all of our questions and let us test out all the beds. He gave us more information that I ever thought possible. He knew about almost every bed. He really helped us pick the correct mattress for our needs. Such a great experience on a big investment for us! But well worth the investment. Thank you!!!<//Review>

<text>We had a great experience at the mattress firm store in la mesa yesterday.  Philippe Dasnabedian greeted us when we walked in and helped us find the perfect mattress for our needs.  He was very knowledgeable and friendly.  We got our mattress delivered less than 24 hours later! I couldnt be happier!  Thanks for making this process an enjoyable one from start to finish.</text>< pics>

<Text>I was shocked at how disrespectful the sales person was to me. Felt like he was yelling at me and telling me how I should feel about the mattress and I didn't know what I was talking about. You can take your mattress and your business and I'll be happy to go elsewhere!< /Text>< pictures>

My wife and I just had a great experience with the staff here at Mattress Firm. We were initially looking for a king size bed but decided that we didnt quite need that size of a bed right away, so we asked what type of deal we could get for just a queen mattress since ours is wearing out. Well let me tell you, not only did they get us a good deal, they started with the top mattress in the store and gave us the beat deal they possibly could. Im a disabled Navy veteran which they took into great consideration while helping us. Our salesman Jerry is patient, didnt push products on us, showed us what the best mattress was for my conditions and gave us an amazing experience. Along with Tommy whom i am assuming is the store manager, both him and Jerry made our buying a mattress a simple and enjoyable time. Thank you guys.

<Text>Beware!! They put fake labels on the mattresses and remove them before delivery. We were sold a Simmons Beautyrest and told it was a $1500  mattress by the manager. We noticed at home that all of the Simmons Beautyrest labels were now removed from the mattress and it is a $400 mattress on Amazon with free delivery. Beware!!!!!!! Beware!!!

<Review>First off. call and setup an appointment. It’s just common sense. These guys are busy. That’s how it works.

I took my Martin 000 here recently and they made it all around better. Plays comfortable, sounds great because it’s done right. I had only told them a quick general idea of what I wanted and got back exactly that, and more because I was blown away with the result just looking at it. They know what they’re doing so not much to say. The difference from the factory setup is huge. I read the reviews on here prior and can now say they weren’t kidding.

So initially I dropped my guitar off and when I received a call, after about two weeks, my guitar was ready. So I asked if I could bring my electric to get setup eventually, whenever they could. So on my way to pickup my acoustic I brought my strat to them because I needed it setup from the factory as well. I hadn’t seen the work yet on my Martin but when I got there and played my Martin 000 all I knew was that I was glad I came here and glad they’re going to set my strat up properly🤘🏼

Go here. Absolutely the move to do if you haven’t.< /Review><name>Kevin Anido<//name><user>118099087899468596324</user><rate>5< /rate>< Resp>

not accurate with estimates after providing all correct info. expect to pay more when you actually drop off your gear there. not friendly, time waster. wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone.

// here is response to the owner's comment below : $35 was not exactly the deal breaker and i thought you at least knew that.
before making the appointment to visit you, we spoke on the phone for almost 10min about two simple things - the nut and string saddle replacement on guitar with the most standard parts options that we specifically discussed. well, in which part did you not get it completely?? what is worse is that when i asked why the cost went up for the same exact things, you didn't even care to explain why. you just said i could just take back my gear. straight up rudeness.<//Text>

it's hard to tell from the entrance to the shop, but inside is stringed instrument repair greatness! they took my Partscaster to the next level with a refret & Plek service. it took a little while, but good things come to those who wait patiently. most of us guitar players have more than one instrument, so I jammed with my other guitars while I waited. it was well worth it! the care & attention to detail these guys exhibit are second to none. highly recommended! thanks again Dan, all success to all of you at 13th Street Guitars. (in all fairness, COVID-19 hasn't helped turn around times)<//text>

If you're a young musician, this is a great place to start learning a lifelong passion. Not a great selection of instruments, as the space is small. Their most notable features are great instrument repair rates for guitars and basses, and lessons.</Review>

Don't think there is anything else I can add to these reviews.  Great personal service. Fantastic work.  Took my guitar in to have the neck pickup switched out, a new nut installed, and a complete set up/fret dress. While they were in there doing everything, they fixed a couple issues I was having with the guitar.  Now, no more issues and the guitar plays and sounds great.  Thanks so much!</review>

<Review>Took my Fender Jazz in to get a Plek'd setup for drop C with D'Addario XL 105's. The job required a new neck, as the old neck had warped too badly to be setup, but they called and told me about the additional cost before replacing it. The new neck feels amazing, the action is so much better, and there's no fret buzz at all on any of the low frets, even given the low tuning I use. Be sure to mention the tuning you'll be playing in when you bring you instrument in, as I didn't, and they needed to re-adjust the truss-rod quickly when I picked it (which they were hapopy to do), as they had set it up for standard tuning. They did a great job, I highly recommend them.< /Review>< resp>

Excellent service. Brought in a Epiphone with damaged frets. They Plecked the frets and the guitar has never played better. I own a few higher end Gibson’s and this guitar’s neck plays as nicely as a Gibson  Custom Shop guitar. So basically for $200.00 they made a $400.00 feel and play like a $4,000.00 guitar.<//text>

<review>This is the best guitar shop in Orange County.  I gave them a ~$800 mid-range guitar for a setup and fret treatment.  I liked the concept of the guitar when I bought it, but it never quite played the way I wanted.  The action wasn't right, and there was issues with some notes buzzing higher up on the fretboard.  Well, when I got it back, the guitar played like a premium model that would cost > $2,000 off the shelf.  They have the "magic touch" which can only be acquired with hard work and experience.  I will never start practicing with a guitar I buy before giving it to 13th Street Guitars for a setup.  No pressure, reasonable prices, EXCELLENT work.</review><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80dd268a411fb7bb:0xf0a4a13925ac5b58</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I took a chance with Hugh solely based on web reviews.  I have a unique guitar made by Mark Warr which is an extended range touch guitar not completely unlike a Chapman Stick but more "guitar-like".  Hugh didn't flinch at all. He spent plenty of one on one time with me discussing what I was looking for in the set up. He made some fantastic suggestions.  At the end of the day I had him install new strap locks in different locations from the originals, resurface the frets, and basically do a notation/action overhaul. The price was extremely reasonable and the turn around was quick.

It's rare to find a talented luthier who also takes customer service seriously.  Hugh is clearly a totally unpretentious guy who's main goal is to make any instrument play better than it ever has.<//Text>

Hugh is an awesome guy, patriot and luthier.  He has worked on a couple of my guitars one by hand [goldtop les paul and a mexican reissue strat on his new plek cnc] Both awesome.         I also tinker with project guitars and amateur luthier stuff and I need a lot of last second parts and  Hugh always comes through with great quality and even better prices.  Im bummed I moved away and will miss his shop!</Review>

I found Hugh and 13th Street Guitars looking for a used guitar on Craigslist.  When I went to check it out, I ran into 3 customers at the store.  Making small talk, I was blown away at what everyone was saying about the owner, Hugh.  They speak of him like a guitar wizard, capable of turning a kit guitar into a Martin.  It was just like the other reviews that I read online.  One of the customers even haggled with Hugh on the price...but not to pay less, to pay more!  I knew I found the right place.
I'm new to the guitar, so I didn't really know how important a good set up was.  The guitar I bought had a full set up from Hugh upon purchase.  But since playing my guitar for sometime now, and subsequently playing other guitars not set up by Hugh...even more expensive guitars not set up by Hugh, I'm convinced of his wizardry.
He also happens to be a kind person and is easy to communicate with (which sadly is worth noting in todays day and age).
If you own a musical instrument with strings, do yourself a favor and bring it to him.  It will play better and easier (yes, easier!).  I'll never take mine anywhere else and feel compelled to share my lucky find with others.</review><name>Travis<//name></record></dataset><record>

Update 10/16/2018: Still taking guitars to the guys and they are still nailing it. Brought in a Gretsch Committee, a not your every day guitar. The worked their magic (set up & pleck)and now it plays better than I ever will. Bottom line they are worth the drive, worth the time and totally worth the $.

I can't say enough good things about the shop.

I am kinda finicky when it comes to guitars and I lean towards Gretsch. That particular brand has its own bit of oddness but Gretsch players have a tendency to go their own way...over the last few years I have brought Hugh various guitars that had everything from intonation issues, Bigsby frustrations and just weird wiring. Hugh never batted an eye. He listened, said "ya we can fix that" and lo and behold the shop got'er done.

He is busy, REALLY busy so make sure when you walk in you know what you want to ask about or have done. Hugh and Tim are good guys and will be happy to answer your questions but...spending time listening to a "no really bro this is what I play" story keeps them away from the workbench. So understand that some things may not get done instantly, they are usually slammed with customers dropping off guitars.

Bottom line this place is legit. They know what they are talking about, do excellent work, make recommendations that are not about taking your money but about finding the best for parts for your axe and you PLUS they stand behind their work. If it's not the way you want they will make it work for you.

U may play a Squire or a Custom shop Les Paul or a G6120 12 string or Taylor or a Bass this shop will make it ring. They get five stars only because I cant give them six.<//Text>

Took my two strats in one for a plek job and the other for a setup the plek job is a 97 and the neck looked pretty nasty and when all said and done it looked like new and the setup on both strats was amazing would recommend them highly if you need work on your guitar.👍< /Text>

This is the worst place ever, my grandma got transferred here after her time in the ER was over. She had made lots of progress and was showing incredible signs. She was doing very good but was very neglected by staff and faculty. Another thing is that they never made sure she had her oxygen on, which she needed. if your loved one is going here for the intense care unit PLEASE DO NOT SEND THEM HERE! This is the worst place ever and they did not continue checking up on my grandma, knowing she would take her oxygen off. This staff does not care for your loved ones health, they show no remorse or kindness to patients what so ever. My grandmother recently passed away because of the neglect she was facing at this rehab. So please if you care for your loved ones; DONT SEND THEM HERE.</review>

My father is in for the last two weeks and is doing great after surgery. The only issue is his walking. Before the surgery he was able to walk around his home, slowly. It was enough to take care of himself. He’s in rehab just to get him walking again, since he hasn’t walked for several weeks. He claims that nobody has been to his room for getting him up and walking around the couple weeks he been in. With no visitors without an appointment it’s hard to verify this, but my father’s memory is very good yet, and when I ask the staff they say they are, my father says differently. Someone is lying.< /Review>

<review>This place just took my grandfather last week and he went in he was just a little weak but the doctors didn't find any major issues other than him not doing enough excerise and eating properly. Within a matter of a couple days he had a terrible staff infection and he was throwing up blood. This place nearly killed my grandfather and to make matters worse they will not let you in half the time, they LOST his personal belongings, and even the doctor at the hospital said that they see this exact issue from this rehab facility all the time!!! They go in fine and they come out near dying!!! This place must be shut down before their negligence gets more people killed!! Makes me sick!< /review>< Response>

This place was a such a bad experience. We had my father here to recover but all they did was neglect him. He got horrible bed soars from how little they acctualy moved him positions and from how little they cleaned him. The doctor never updated you with peogress or with lab test results. The physical theipy personel would do the minimum and just be talking the whole time amongs themselfs. We had them send my father to the hospital becuse they neglected to do anything about a mass growing in his stomach. Neddless to say it was a serious situation and if we didnt get him to the icu quickly things could have taken a turn for the worse. Seams like all they did here was add more pain.<//review>

My mother in law was sent here because she tested positive for COVID. Thankfully she survived with only a moderate case. Overall this place is like all the others she has been in. I would normally give 3 stars if it were not for her case manager Kim. She was so kind and was the best we have experienced anywhere. Reche Canyon, if you are reading this, she is making you look much better in my eyes and earned you a solid one star increase!!!</text>

My father was transferred to this facility by Corona regional hospital that did absolutely nothing for him. But this facility took wonderful care and they did allow us to come in at the end of his life so we could contact family that was not able to be here so everyone could say their goodbyes. They were very wonderful and caring.</Review>

<text>My cousin suffered brain damage 7+years ago and is totally bedridden. He has been To multiple locations where he has received less than average care and it was so terrifying to see the horrible things that go on at some of these care facilities. We had to move him around until we found a place that we saw was consistently and properly taking care of him and his needs, as well as ours when we inquired about his recovery. Hes now been at Reche Canyon Rehab for almost 5 years and they have done wonders with him. They go above and beyond to make sure he gets the best care possible. We’ve never noticed any signs of neglect or mistreatment from any of his caretakers or staff members at this facility unlike the previous two locations he was at prior to arriving there. Family is super important and it’s so hard to find nice safe clean place with great people to care for them when they’re in need of help. I saw all these horrible reviews so I had to speak up and share with others about how awesome this place truley is because it is so hard and really scary trying to find a good place for our loved ones. So I was really upset to read bad things about such a good place. I called today just to check in on the visitation schedule and LJ picked RIGHT AWAY and was super professional and helpful, like always. He had to place me on hold to get my question answered but came back within 60 seconds with all the information info i needed and more. Plus he always has a great attitude and was very knowledgeable. Dont let this crazy pandemic situation mess up a good place’s reputation, were all dealing with crazy times right now with the limited resources so we have to be considerate for the people who are taking care of the people who cant care for themselves. I’ve had to take care of my own Mom and it was so hard to find time and deal with her needs and crazy stubbornness and house, feed and bath her, so I understand the struggle is real.<//text>< pics>

I did leave a nasty detailed review about how infested this location is but it did not post. Do not take loved ones there. staff is infected and told to stay at work by administration. this is detrimental to our society health. Very poor due diligence. 65+ cases and no precocious taken. so if you care do not go to this facility< /Text>

<text>I was a patient at this facility a few years back and after reading all the awful ratings I had to put my two cents in. My stay in this facility save my life I was in a motorcycle accident where I fractured my back the therapist that work with me his name is Joe me he got me through my first month at what turned out to be Exchange in life I was in a wheelchair for 7 months learning how to walk again it was a staff at this facility they gave me all the tools I needed to move on with my life. I think all the awful reviews come from people expecting miracles or more that can really be expected. In order to recover from an injury you have to want to be rehabilitated if you treat your therapist and staff poorly you will obviously get a poor response.</text>< pics>

< review>
If you care about your loved ones, do not let them go here. I would give a zero star if I could. They’re negligence led to my grandfathers passing. They do not care. They left him alone for hours on end, he ended up getting bed sores. They gave him narcotics when he wasn’t prescribed anything but Motrin. He lost a ton of weight because they weren’t feeding him. Seems like they just want their patients drugged so they don’t have to do their Job.<//review>

<Review>My brother is there and has ALS, he has severely progressed since February when he got there. I can't believe they lost a computer of his that he uses daily to communicate with his wife and daughter. He has had numerous roommates pass away in the last 3 months due to negligence of not responding to alarms coming from the rooms. There all too busy having luncheons and fundraisers for there own special events. I can't wait till my bro gets out of there and his wife can bring him home. For this place has doubled the stress on her and his condition.<//Review><Response>None< /Response>< rate>

<Review>My sister was sent to Reche canyon rehab after sustaining a back injury. The nurses aide put a diaper on her. She is not incontinent! She was able to use the bedpan. They were so long answering the call light that she had to use the diaper a few times and ended up with a bladder infection which they did not treat. She was discharged after 10 days. It was very rushed and the nurse and physical therapist seemed surprised and unprepared. She was sent home without discharge instructions. The doctor ordered home health, PT and OT. The case manager did nothing! She should have gotten authorization from her insurance and sent orders to a home health agency. She did Nothing.
Her primary doc took care of the infection and home health. She has been home 2 weeks in a back brace without home health or PT. They are starting tomorrow.

Reche canyon rehab is incompetent, smelly, uncaring. Don’t go there!</Review>< date>

Why has this facility remain opened??
I feel that this place should be investigated thoroughly by state officials. Doctors and Social Services do not respond to messages left.  Patient with anxiety & pain left for another patient only to die from heart attack that could possibly be prevented!  DO NOT SEEK CARE HERE!!</text>

Every RN has 20 patients a person. There is no way any patients needing real care or assistance to be cared for there is just no time for anykind of attention. If you loved is basically 100% healthy and can communicate clearly and use the restroom alone you can send them here... but if they need help or assistance PLEDE SAVE THEIR LIVES and fight for them to go to Somewhere else..this place does give enough staff to properly run.. I will give another review with details later... please fight you loved ones</Text>< pictures>

Kaiser Permanente recommended that our mother live her last days in this facility because the doctors didn’t think she would survive living in the higher elevation where we live on hospice. Kaiser provided the “comfort care” room. This room is designed to be family friendly, allowing 24/7 access and a place for a member of the family to sleep with her overnight. The doctors are caring and compassionate. Everyone was helpful and respectful. The setting is amazing, away from the hustle and bustle of the city yet freeway close for all the family to visit.</Text>

<text>My mom was there & she hated it. She was left exposed, left in the bathroom for 45 mins with the door closed. Thank God I spoke to the doctor who released her to my care. Although Administration was very helpful who tried to resolve any problems. It’s the nurses, they are overwhelmed, too many patients & not enough staff. This is what one nurse relayed to me. Watch your Love one closely there cause patients are usually unattended.< /text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcac6f5ebb8813:0x6e313692d6103084< /Gmap_id></record>

My wife was sent here about a montn ago for physical theraphy on her leg. From the second she got there @ 9 o'clock  she wasn't acknowledged  at all. It took the staff almost 3hr for them to realize she was a new patient if it wasn't for myself asking them for her meds and any documents they needed me to sign for her , they would have taken longer for her to get acknowledged , they also give u dirty looks  when u ask for there services. Also her pain meds where not even in there system  they had to re-order them. So she was in agonizing pain for about 16 hrs. Staff was suppose to help her in and out of bed do to the fact she was a fall risk, they did care at all she was made to get up on her own to the restroom. And back and also adjust her self on the bed when she wasn't able too cause she had cervical surgery. That got me so angry  I got my wife out there in 1 day. This place should  b shut down  do to the fac5 that they r very careless.....<//Text>

<review>From the first day until she was discharged my sister's care was wonderful. The entire staff are caring, compasionate and are highly skilled and efficient. Her case manager, Cindy Peel ushered her and our family with kindness and skill throughout her stay and guided us in finding another placement. Thank you Reche Canyon.< /review>< time>

My father was sent to this "rehabilitation" center after a broken back and head trauma in late April. The staff is barely attentive and give dirty looks when you ask for assistance making it almost a necessity to be there from open to close. My father developed blood clots which moved to his lungs after Kaiser had to re-stitch the incision because of an infection he developed because Reche left his back brace on 24/7 rarely turning him. After he was cleared they sent him back to reche where he spent 3 weeks of people leaving him alone in the dark, refusing medicine, ignoring his yells and screams for help and the physical therapy was a joke. This is a nursing home where very ill people go, not a facility to help get people up and going.This is the worst place I've ever been to. My father and our family were traumatized by this facility.< /Review>

My sister was here couple months ago. We put her in this facility for a week due to flu season, we all had flu and we did not want her to get sick. The second day after we brought her home she passed away due to their neglect. If you care for your love one do not take her there.< /Review>

My wife was there for a week. The staff was very professional.  The care and attendance she received was very good to exceptional.  Dr. Sid and the nurses and their assistants really cared about my wife and her health problems.</Text>

This place is filthy.  I can't believe kiaser would send anyone here.  My father will probably die in this place.  He's only been here less than 24 hrs and for some reason his health has taken a nose dive...< /Text>

Place is horrible. I wouldn't send my worst enemy there. My very dear friend acquired a staph infection there, they refused to give her pain medication & she ultimately died there. As she was taking her last breaths her doctors denied that she was dying & refused to give her medication to assist with her shortness of breath. This is coming from a hospice nurse.</Review>

< Review>
I was sent to Reche Canyon from Kaiser, Fontana  after 15 days in the Hospital, flat on my back. I am 85 years old and midway through my stay at Kaiser I had surgery to repair a torn diaphragm and liver from a broken rib. When they discharged me to Reche Canyon I had not been out of bed for 15 days. I arrived at Reche Canyon on Easter Sunday, April 16th with Oxygen @ 2% and couldn't even sit up by myself. The staff was wonderful, attentive, the food wan't too bad and best of all - NO SMELL. They worked with me every day and I was discharged on April 29th without any oxygen and able to get up out of bed and walking around the facility on my own, with a walker of course. I am very happy with the care I was given  here and would recommend this facility to anyone who must go to a skilled nursing facility.< /Review>

I hate to even give this place one star but I have to because it won't let me choose zero stars. BEWARE!  Worst place ever!!  My 22 year old son was sent here from Kaiser with a brain injury.  We only had four options of sub acute care facilities to choose from and Reche Canyon was the best of the worst. The first time he was sent there he was only there for four days when he had to be rushed back to the hospital with pneumonia as well as an unstageable bed wound (did not have this when he was discharged from Kaiser 4 days prior).  The bed wound was later staged at a stage 4. He was sent back to Reche Canyon two weeks later where his bed wound continued to get worse (down to his bone). Within a two month timeframe he was in the emergency room at Loma Linda 3 different times. The last straw for me was when they ended up having to bag him (CPR) because his oxygen saturation dropped below 50%, he was sent to the emergency room at Loma Linda where he then was transferred to Kaiser with pneumonia for the third time, a completely out of control bed wound,  and a staph infection. After that I did everything I could not to let them send him back to Reche Canyon. Reche Canyon almost killed my son due to the lack of care. I was there every single day with my son but they do not allow anybody to stay past 9 PM. So between 9:00 PM and the next day only God knows what they did with my son or didn't do with my son.  Plenty of times staff there would tell me that they are understaffed and this is why some patients don't get tended to properly, especially the patients that don't have family members to speak up for them. If your family member cannot speak for themselves DO NOT send them here. I have educated myself on patients rights and learned how to be an excellent advocate for my son.<//review>

My father, Wilburn Milligan is in room 112 and had to wait an hour for someone to give him pain medicine last night for his broken hip, he is almost 90 years old.
today he came back from dialysis and needed covers on and again his call button doesn't seem to work to get help! The lady with his dinner tray had to help him! I hope he has his pain medicine when he needs it tonight, or I will be filing a complaint! I called the hospital and got disconnected!<//Review>

<review>Really really good bbq. I had the burnt ends sandwich with a side of mac & cheese. My wife had the pulled pork sandwich with a side of baked beans. Everything was delicious. The burnt ends melt in your mouth. The meat was the right amount of smokey and the sauce was on point.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80dc713918f62867:0xdcb64167bf937fda<//Gmap_id>< rate>

Wow! Best BBQ I've had in California. They make brisket Texas style! Nobody makes brisket here. And it melts in your mouth. The BBQ sauce is yummy, and I'm picky about BBQ sauce.
I got a Shack Attack. It was huge. Well worth the money. Even eating it later at room temperature, it was still one of the best things I've ever eaten. I'm not going anywhere else for BBQ from now on. I have found BBQ heaven.</review>

<Review>This place was legit, probably the best BBQ I've tasted in a while in San Diego. I tried the brisket sandwich, it was perfectly smoked, juicy and favorable. The sauce complimented the brisket well and I like how they served the sauce on the side. I will definitely be back and will post pictures/reviews of different menu items I try. Stay small... ; )< /Review>< userid>

I live in OC and when I head to SD County I always pick up some BBQ. The brisket, burnt ends, and jalapeno sausage are next level. The smoke he gets into the meat is amazing.  Also love the passion he puts into BBQ and appreciate how they treat the customers.<//text>

They catered my daughters wedding right when everything with covid blew up. We were the last wedding allowed in Oside. They were amazing! The food was amazing! We had fried chicken, tri-tip, Mac and cheese and beans! Oh and the cornbread! 🤤 We got so many compliments on the amazing food! The prices were fair and the service was amazing! Absolutely recommend them!!! Great food and great people!<//Text>

<Review>Edit: I went from 1 star to 3 stars simply because you respected the money I spent by refunding me. That speaks alot to your character and business. I will come back and try and change my rating accordingly. Thank you!❤

I don't know how they won awards. Baked beans were meh. Macaroni and cheese was flavorless. Chicken wings weren't cooked all the way through and were pink in the middle. Brisket was decent but the bbq sauce was watery and just provided moisture more than flavor.

Waste of $54.< /Review><gmapID>0x80dc713918f62867:0xdcb64167bf937fda< /gmapID><user>106626303769836248704</user>< Rating>

I haven’t had good pulled pork barbeque in so long. These guys made really good food. I’m no fan of cole slaw, but the sandwich i had (which had cole slaw) was so freaking good. Brought back good memories< /Review>

Idk when or if he'll open a restaurant in our state but I don't care, I finally have a place to go to get amazing ribs, wings, brisket & BBQ sauce!

AMAZING BBQ PLACE! The brisket is cooked just the perfect amount to have that smoky, backyard barbeque taste, with just the right amount of professionalism and experience behind it to keep you coming back again and again. If you are looking for a BBQ place to go to that everyone will enjoy, I could not recommend Fat BBQ Shack Express any stronger.< /review>

I have had countless bbq sandwiches growing up in the south. Grilling out on a Sunday is a cultural aspect of where I’m from. I’ve had bbq from family friends and neighbors. My point is I have forgotten more BBQ than I can begin to remember AND FAT BBQ Shack is THE BEST of any bbq I’ve ever had. You can’t go wrong. I’ve had several items from the menu and they have each been amazing. I miss seeing this food truck at the beach but I will be driving to find it. I wish I could give you guys 10 stars!!!!<//Text>

Finally,a place that offers REAL BBQ. The sandwiches are GREAT. I've only had BBQ from Texas once, thought it was great. Not sure why there aren't restaurants that offer southern BBQ. The brisket, sausage, and burnt ends are GREAT. The people that own the food stand are awesome as well.</Text>

<username>Coleen Bryan<//username><Review>We were driving home from San Diego and wanted BBQ. We found this treasure off yelp and we decided to give it a try.  EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING. The Brisket was melt in your mouth and the bbq  pork was delicious. We fought over the mac n cheese and onion rings. I love when a family restaurant share their talents with the community. We are so grateful to know that great bbq actually exists in California.

They have outside seating and take out so it makes it a great choice for Fat BbQ shack express at any time!!!! The Best Brisket in Oceanside!  The Best BbQ in Oceanside!</Review>< pictures>

Heard about this local spot from some friends who swear by the food, so had to give it a try.

This review is based off the brisket burger and service, maybe some of the other menu items are better.

First the service:
There were a few customers already waiting when I placed my order so I expected a bit of a wait, but 35 minutes is more than I would expect for no line and maybe 3 orders before mine.  One of the employees son ordered after me and kept sticking his unmasked face into the interior and talking, regardless of what their opinion of the health crisis is it's terrible to
look like the business doesn't value their customers health.

The food:
The Brisket was cooked perfectly, tender and still juicy, but the marinade had an overpowering flavor of liquid smoke ruining the natural flavor of the meat.  There was sauce on the sandwich when I was told they only put the sauce on the side.

Overall not great especially considering the $15 price, but they do know their way around a smoker.< /Text>

Sorry about our son he just arrived with family all the way from Kansas we was overly excited. We are very covid proactive. As you see from our plastic rapped trailer and no contact ordering and payment methods. I don’t think Californians are used to real smoked bbq because we don’t marinate or use liquid smoke and the Brisket burger is the only sandwich that comes with sauce. Looking forward to seeing you soon.'}< /Resp>< rate>

<Text>Absolutely the BEST BBQ in Oceanside and North county. I suspected something great was happening on this corner. Every time I passed by there were lots of cars and people with smiling faces. My wife and I have a few rare days without kids where we can have a nice lunch date together and decided to give this place a try. SO glad we did. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING on the menu is absolutely off the chart delicious and 100% authentic. Everything looked so good that I was faced with the dilemma of what to order. The owner, obviously very experienced with the dumbfounded look on our faces, stepped in and rescued us from our indecision. He generously provided us with some samples of their delicious smoked brisket, burnt ends, ribs and sausage. Normally, I HATE sausage from the grocery store. But, my friends, this is NO ordinary sausage. Made fresh on the spot...it tastes like the choicest, prime cuts of meat. Not like the fillers, cartilage and gristle you'd find elsewhere. That was the clincher for me. I immediately order the "Smokn Gun", which has brisket & house sausage topped with pickle and onion.
I'm going back tomorrow with the entire family (in-laws included). I urge fire Mountain residents to make this your go-to place to satisfy your BBQ fix.<//Text>< name>

You will be disappointed, the food is ok, I’ve had better. We didn’t not think it was worth it. The lady who helped us was extremely rude! Definitely will never be back. Another lady who was before us also complained about her order. I saw nothing but positive reviews on here not sure what happened.<//text>

<text>I heard about this place through the nextdoor app so I figured I'd give it a try. There were a few people there and I waited around for about 7 minutes without the fine folks at fat BBQ even saying hi. I might try it another time, we'll see. Happy to drive on down the street to get something else to eat.

I'm review might be different if I go there and actually get service.

A friend of mine and I stopped by there today and have quite the different story to tell. The folks were right courteous and the service was quick and the food was great. 👍< /text>< Pics>

I didn't like the service I think they were the respectful
The french fries they were to burn
And very small portion
And took very long time to get the sandwich,
the sandwich gets one star<//text>

It's such an AMAZING skate park!!! It has a cool skater  area, a quad roller skate area, AND a park with some cool equipment for the kids. Gorgeous park! There is a gas station/convenience store CONVENIENTLY located behind the ample parking lots. It's an ALL in ONE location!! I will definitely be back with my skates!< /Text>

Cool park with big playground, bbq areas for different size groups. Also has a sweet skate park and lots of pick up games at the basketball courts.<//review>

<text>Fun little spot next to the skate park and basketball courts. There are some at least two excellent grills available for some light to heavy duty grill work to be accomplished. Bathrooms are on site, as well.

We may have arrived a little too early (9AM), as the overnighter were still on the premises, gathering their belongings to leave. You are close to the gas station and main road (1), and the hospital is a few blocks away. It didn't seem like a safety concern to me, but if you are uncomfortable in these situations, you should take this into consideration.< /text><gmap_id>0x80ecf1ab3de0104b:0x9142ba9dee8ec8db<//gmap_id><username>Chief Rocca<//username><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< date>

Super awesome place to take the kids to skate. But a good amount of the local kids were rude towards others....kinda disappointed on that part. Other than that totally cool spot!!</Review>

<text>The skatepark is so cool! There’s a bunch of different bowls and ramp and the snake run is so fun! That giant wave makes the skatepark more picturesque. Love that park</text>< pics>

<Text>Pretty much a campground for homeless people. don't take your kids there unless you want to take a chance of your child stepping on hypodermic needle. Or listen to the crazy homeless people scream at each other.<//Text><Rate>1< /Rate>< pics>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>SLO skate park has everything you'd want if you're looking to take your skate-fu to the next level. The people I see here are friendly and respectful. Ideal place for a picnic, reading books and exercising in town. I give Santa Rosa Park a 5/5; would definitely dislocate my left elbow again.a<//Review>< gmap_id>

<Review>Playground is minimal but fun for younger kids. Definitely a hotspot for homeless individuals who are scattered throughout the park, sleeping on sidewalks, benches, grass. My son was playing by some bushes and the maintenance man approached me and suggested I keep my kids away from the bushes due to homeless throwing trash and syringes in them. Wasn't too thrilled about the thought of that. I did see one city police officer pull in, park for 15 minutes and leave. I'd probably feel better if there was more of a police presence around. It can be kind of unnerving if you're there alone with your children, even during the middle of the day.<//Review>< Rate>

This is a very nice park with picnic tables and benches. Also has a bbq pit for the big parties!! There is a baseball diamond and a skateboard park at one end.
Lots of nice green grass next to San Luis  creek!!</Text>

Horrible! It's a shame to see this filthy conditions in a city with so much revenue. The picnic tables were nasty and at least a dozen homeless encampments along the fence occupying the park facilities. Do not let young children go there alone. It is definitely dangerous. Very sad situation for a city known as a touristic route. I will never stop there again. I"ll just keep driving thru.</review>

While it's a very big park w picnic tables, shade trees and plenty of parking the local homeless have made it their night time hangout. During the day you'll see them sleeping on the tables, grouped up around trees, and loitering at the stores next door. Not the ideal park for kids.<//text>

The park itself isn't that great and the location isn't very safe for the children. It's ambiance is very rushed and fast paced for my liking. It is near the creek however the creek is unkept and not very sanitary to say the least. I would not recommend to anyone. Especially tourists. You will be disappointed.< /Review>

The park was nice. Not too hot not to sunny with a nice cooling breeze. There were people enjoying the skate park the green grass and the shade of the tree as well as others playing with their children and making use of the roller hockey rink to practice. There was a lost fawn hopping around on the baseball field that seemed to draw a nice crowd if interested and curious new fans. I enjoyed it.</review>

This place is typically host to little league baseball and adult softball games. There's also a nice play ground, a roller rink and a skate park. It's always full of people and seems like a great place for kids and teens to hang out.

The only downside to this place is the bathrooms are absolutely HORRENDOUS. I NEVER use these ones.</Text>

The actual park is pretty nice, people frequent the place alot. Dogs roam freely and children play on the playground. The giant tall structures from the skating park look amazing as well. Not enough cover for shade and the rain however< /Review>

<Text>I took my son to this park since we were in the area. The park itself is on the smaller side then what we are used to but very nice and a fun place to visit. Definitely worth stopping by. Park was clean. Bathrooms were close enough to play structure. Plenty of kids of different age groups played here and had a blast. Also i think they larp here some weekends. Kinda cool to see the "big kids" having fun too. 😊< /Text>< response>

<Review>Crawling with them... And not earthworms wink, wink. The skate park that was added a while back is pretty awesome even though I've never used it. Just going by the word on the mean streets of San Luis Obispo. If you can hang, drop on in and show your skillz. People seem to be pretty welcoming for the most part. Other than the significant transient population that tends to congregate here at times.<//Review>< Pics>

I had never before visited this park.  It's a lot of fun, and right next to the hospital where we were visiting someone.  There's a sort-of-secret entrance right across the street from the hospital, too.  That way you don't have to drive to the park--just park at the hospital and walk to the park!  Fun playground for the kids, and there's an awesome skate park!< /review>

As far as parks go, this is one of the best in the city. It has restrooms, a great newer playground, large grassy area with trees, sports fields, dual purpose basketball courts/roller hockey rink, and a new skate park! Your kids will never run out of things to do at this park.<//review>

A nice place to walk, the skate park is the attraction for me, very entertaining to watch. Other than that, California has some problems with parks and extra people using drugs that must be solved. It's on view here during some of my visits, day and night.<//Text>

This park has an awesome skate park and a decent skating rink. It is a great place to have a party, play a sport, bring your kids to play or just relax. It has the usual barbeque set up with ample table seating near the play structure and a huge baseball diamond area as well. On the weekends you can find people LARPing and other cool stuff. Could use another restroom more conveniently located near the skating area and baseball field.</review>

You got done homeless peeps or they have homes and pose to be homeless so they can hang out in the park and all for food and money. You also got some people on drugs now and then just walk on to the field during a softball game, they the in field, in the dugout and keep on walking... Trip out. Other than that, the skate park is very very top notch and a street hockey court... Out is it called a field...hmm it's on cement.</text>

<Text>Great open space with plenty of infastructure and fields for all kinds of activities. Theres a playground and a horseshoe pit! The best part about this park is that on the weekends there are people who dress up and fight each other with swords. This area is truly built for peoppe from all walks of life.< /Text>< UserId.>

Love the skate rink and skate park. Would be better if there was a covered roof over skate rink (then it could be used year round)... and bathrooms near the rink area.</review>

Great park for skate boarding and for your kids to play. It is clean and we'll kept and we have not been harassed by the bums here too much.   Mitchell park is a challenge in this regard.  Lots of nomadic voluntary homeless drug adicted wayfarers flock to SLO for the nice weather and excellent free services.   Parks are often challenged by them.  This one is pretty good in this respect.<//Text>

Too many drug addicted homeless people that the police tolerate. Syringes in the shrubs. Poorly maintained ball field and the basketball courts are rarely available. SLO parks and rec needs to step up its game.< /Review>

<Review>Really decent park as far as public parks go. Not a lot of play equipment, but they did build a massive skatepark, which is awesome. The fields are also in great condition too.< /Review>< UserId.>

Grass, benches, jungle gym, hockey rink, skateboard park and walking path around the area to watch all the activities. There is also a large real grass field and plenty of parking. A must go to for the skate park. There is also a horseshoe area and I'm guessing the shoes are locked up and must be opened by county parks employee.< /text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>(Translated by Google) In that park you can find bowl base camp, basketball and skating courts and it is nice and relaxing to be lying on the grass, a very quiet place.

(Original)
En ese parque puedes encontrar campo de base bol, canchas de basket bol y de patinaje y es bonito y relajante estar tirado en el pasto un lugar muy tranquilo.< /Review><user>102931428507181122127</user><gmap_id>0x80ecf1ab3de0104b:0x9142ba9dee8ec8db<//gmap_id>< pictures>
