This place just opened two weeks ago. It is a really nice Starbucks with new floor plan and drive-thru. It seems this Starbucks is part of a multi-level building and not just to stand alone store.<//text>

<Review>A new Starbucks, a drive through, which is great. But omg, they are SLOW. Yesterday it took them a full 5 minutes to simply pour me a cup of dark drip coffee. As I sat at the window, already paid. I suppose they had to brew a pot to accomplish this? I finally hollered in that Pikes was fine, just hand me something!
The little girl who eventually showed up was all wiggles and smiles, we got your dark roast!!! So proud!!!
I'd give that a pass, but I have been going here a lot, and they are consistently off. Today, they were out of most breakfast sandwiches,  so I ordered the egg bites. 4 cars ahead of me at time of order. Get to window, get coffee, wait. Then asked to drive to the front so someone can bring out the egg bites. Wait another 6 minutes. Seriously? Then watched a young man roam from car to car, holding them out, did you order these? Apparently no one thought to identify my vehicle. And no, there was no one inside, and obviously no one ahead of me. A 30 second task required about 15 minutes to accomplish.

In addition, when getting a refill, the girl demanded my "Starbucks card" to scan for payment. I said no, I'm trying to hand you 50 cents. She stared at the coins , not moving,  apparently not comprehending.  All of this and more, after at least 10-15 visits, is what's happening here.

All delays were blamed on mistakes. Right. No kidding.
Be prepared to wait. And wait. And do check your order. 😳</Review><name>Michelle VanFleet of Faery Mysterium</name></record>

Great new addition to SB/Goleta. Finally have a drive-thru coffee option after decades of lobbying. Plenty of outdoor seating, but a bit limited inside.<//Text>

They screwed up my mobile order. I called to tell them and I was told they'd replace original item. I went in and was told person on phone was not manager. They hesitantly fixed their mistake. Don't know that I'd mobile order from that location again.< /text>

This drive thru has now been there for 1 year. Its been a touch and go process. The staff, at times, is great. But then they can be really lacking and messing up orders.

Going in and ordering would be your best way but due to the covid virus, its not recommended.

Just expect average customer service so you don't get disappointed.< /Text>

I love starbucks, but this time I went I was disappointed. Such a long wait and when we finally received our drinks one of the cups was cracked. It was spilling on the side through the crack making a mess in the car. I usually don't complain, but it was not worth the wait.<//review>

< Review>
I am so upset I think this Starbucks is very messed up because I went threw the dive threw and my husband forgot his card they never told us and I came in I asked for my card back and the guy said he would bring it out side to me I was already inside I asked nicely and he yelled at me and the way he handed my food to me was so bad I payed 40 dollars and he almost dropped my food he was mad and I don’t understand then he gives me the food and he slams it into the shield inside of Starbucks I’ll never ever go there again</Review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>Terrible service to recieve your coffee,
Took 30 minutes for some peopl to get their coffee . 20 min.in I asked for a refund , that's way to long to wait for a latte .
They have 2 aisles working 1 for drive thru and 1 for walk ins . The girl that was making the coffee for walk ins goes and
helps the drive thru line and leaves no
one to make the coffee in the walk in line . Definatly need to hire more staff.
Terrible Terrible Terrible

Pretty cool and clean park for kids to play. Has picnic tables and grills if you're looking up bbq. 2 basketball half-courts with nets. Clean baseball softball or little league baseball field (wood bats preferred) has a gazebo with benches and restrooms (No toilet paper, seat covers, or soap)< /review>

Park is very nice but the bathrooms are locked at 1pm on a Wednesday. As a pregnant mom I'm unhappy about not being able to use the bathroom and having to make my toddler leave early because I have to pee.</Review>

Park is clean and family friendly. Homeless people often gather in the park in the mornings and late evenings. The bathrooms are now permanently locked due to the homeless people leaving large messes inside them so if you need to use the restroom do so before visiting the park. Has a good walking path that's well lit until 9 or 10 at night.<//text>

<review>The bathrooms were dirty and unusable and there was a lot of drug action going on. I thought I was talking to a nice young man with his five year old sister along with him. He said they had to go so I watched as he put his sister in the car then he went to the covered picnic tables to sell drugs. Stay away.</review><time>1497575604884< /time></record></dataset><record>

<text>I started coming to this laundromat after the one near my place shut down permanently. I read the reviews here and they were good so I decided to check the place out myself. Let me tell you the staff here is so friendly and helpful. Place is super clean and they all wear masks. I even noticed the lady that did my wash n fold wore gloves, masks and a face shield. They really care about customers' clothes like they are their own. I have not seen a cleaner laundromat to be honest. I will definitely be coming here from now on.</text>< Pics>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Text>Self-serve laundry, dry clean or fluff and go. If you have a lot of laundry, pay the extra 10.00.   Park Laundry will wash and fold like a personal assistant. Free soap- Costco or Smart and Final brand or similar. Staff always on-site and responsive, courteous and professional.

Place is always clean and sanitized. Bathroom is always sanitized. Machines are maintained and work without a glitch. Single load wash to 7 lb loader. Plenty of heavy duty machines. Prices range from $3.50-$6.25. dryers $0.25 for 6 minutes most time dryers are hot but sometimes it's amiss. 3 quarters takes care of most loads.   Few wire tables and chairs with outlets. Long countertops for folding.

Best time to go early morning or 7 pm. even when crowded people know how to navigate. Parking lot in the back. Metered parking in the front. Walking distance.. quickbites, convenience store and Sprout's.<//Text>< pics>

<time>1611935439961<//time><review>I started coming here twice a week for the last couple of months.
On more than one occasion the employees were not wearing masks. This morning I left before starting my laundry and confirmed with the one of three people working there wearing a mask if they were open and if they all wear masks. He said yes. I left and called their number to tell him that I left because two people were not wearing masks. They run a fluff and fold so I wouldnt depend on them being safe or clean.</review><Pics>None</Pics></record>

I walked in and was pleasantly greeted by the staff. The place was busy and was much larger than expected, but there were still plenty of machines to use. I love how open it was and there is a breeze that goes through that really helps while washing clothes. Prices are cheap and parking was easy.

Nice and friendly staff as soon as you walk in. The place has cleaned up a lot since the last owner. The new owners are so friendly and welcoming. It looks a lot more inviting and very clean. One of the best Laundromats in the area. Hands down!

Update: Brought my suit in here and it came out looking amazing. The price was really cheap too. Would not go anywhere else. Happy with the results!<//Review>

The dry cleaning here is the best in town! My dress came out so nice and it was super cheap compared to other places I've been to in North Park. The young man there that works nights is also so friendly and he always helps me carry my stuff to the car. They do an excellent job here by caring for each customer. Great service, cheap prices, and great people overall.<//text>

I just recently moved to the area and was trying to find a place to take my work outfits for dry cleaning. I googled the closest thing near me and this place popped up and I noticed it had great ratings. I thought I should stop in and give it a shot and so I was very happy that I did. I moved from New York where it was always soo expensive to dry clean anything. Coming in here made me realize that you can actually get a good deal for dry cleaning. I dropped off 4 outfits and the price was not even half of what I used to pay. The service was great because everyone there was very nice and helpful.  My items were also ready for pickup in 2 days, which was faster than expected. Great experience overall and will definitely mention it to others.<//text>

This is a top spot to do your laundry!
Family owned and run, thus everything is being looked after and clean.
Had to wash our family clothes while on vacation and followed the good reviews and wasn't disappointed.
Clean, well organised and helpful staff!
I even took some of their business cards for the hotel we were staying at, so they know which place to recommend in the future :)

Keep up the good work!</Text>

<review>Update: Came here at 9pm to do laundry, and the rotund spanish-speaking woman at the front (curly hair) said I couldn't do laundry! They close at 10, and I have never seen any "last load" signs. I have been to this place several times before, it never took even nearly an hour.

Old: Too much hot sun through windows near small washers, they need to install blinds. also, Water was shut off twice the day I came apparently to fix the toilet. That should have been done during off-hours.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Amazing place. Since I've been in the San Diego area this laundromat is the cleanest that I've been in.  All the machines are well taken care of and there is always someone there to help you out. I will definitely return here to do my laundry gain< /Review><date>1547053708293</date><Rate>5< /Rate><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

I came here to get our family clothes washed because our washer broke and I gotta tell you that the people that work at this establishment are so pleasant and nice. The young gentleman that was working there helped me carry all my clothes out of the car and proceeded to weigh them quickly for their wash n fold service so I can be out the door with my receipt. He worked so fast I could not believe it. I told him I needed them as soon as possible since my washer broke and he mentioned he would text me to tell me as soon as they were ready. I went about my day running errands and it was a few hours later that afternoon they sent me a text that it was ready for pickup. The clothes came out great and perfectly folded just the way I like them. I love their service and attitude here. Will definitely be telling my friends and family so they can stop in if they need to.<//text>

Cool place to come in and do your laundry. Nice, clean and the attendant is always really friendly with everyone. I used to do my laundry elsewhere and then decided to come here because they raised their prices on me. This place is the cheapest in the area for sure. Can't beat the free parking either being in North Park.<//text>

I came in to this place to do my laundry and it was really nice. The staff was very friendly and it was super clean and bright. They had free Wi-Fi and tables so I can get some work done while waiting for my laundry to finish. Lots of free parking in the back and the attendant also mentioned I can use the bathroom because I'm a customer. No complaints here!!<//review>

<text>I really enjoyed coming in here last Saturday. The place was so quiet and clean, it made me think of my own home. I dropped off my laundry for their wash n fold service in the morning and they sent me a text that same afternoon that it was ready. All my clothes came out great and perfectly folded. Same day service, can't beat that! No wonder this place had award-winning plaques on their wall.<//text>< pics>

Came in to dry clean a few work outfits and they came out looking great. The prices are very reasonable and it's such a clean facility. I also saw that they had a best dry cleaner award on their wall, can't beat that. I just found my new favorite dry cleaner!< /Text>

Our washing machine broke, and I was not looking forward to going to a laundromat. I found Park Blvd. and Laundry online, and headed over. Parking is free in the back. The owner is incredibly sweet (I hadn't gone here before and he walked me through everything, since I had my newborn with me). He hooked me up with bottled water and I hadn't even asked. Really nice, peaceful experience. Also, free soap and wifi. Thank you to the owner who made my experience very chill. He seems to care about his customers.< /review>

I can't say enough about how nice the staff is here. The prices are pretty cheap as well compared to the other laundry places I used to go to. Dry cleaning here is great and it always comes out perfect.The free parking really is such a plus in this area. The last thing anyone wants is to pay for parking and then go pay for doing your laundry as well.< /text>

This place has the best service out of any laundromat I've been to in the area. I never have to wait for my dry cleaning and it always comes out super clean and ready to be worn. I recommend this to anyone who is frustrated with their dry cleaner and is looking for one with great service and cheap prices.</Text>

After our laundry machines went down I did the logical thing and decided to google a laundry locations, thankfully  discovered park blvd laundry. As I walked in I was greeted with very pleasant staff, who were very generous to provide me help. The place has a very welcoming and clean atmosphere if you want to just relax away from the stressful times at home, gives you nice quiet of peace and serenity.  Will come back again for sure!< /Review>

I've used all but dry cleaning service and have experienced nothing but great service and quality laundry output. I think I could ask for additional services I.e. Sorting, spray n wash, etc if I wanted more attention to detail. The owner is very service oriented. Their price is very competitive. I'm very happy with Park Blvd Laundry.<//Review>

I came across this place when I was having breakfast with my husband in the Hillcrest area. You can hear the music and the TV as soon as you walk in. I could tell right away that it was really clean and smelled like fresh dryer sheets, which I happen to love. The lady at the counter, I think her name was Kim, was super friendly and she even taught me how to use the machines. I managed to finish my clothes in about an hour and was out of there in no time. Thanks to Kim and Park Blvd for making my weekend just a little bit easier!< /Review>

It wasn't very busy since it was early morning, but the attendant there took my order in no time.

Place has cleaned up a lot in the past months. New paint, lights, even a nice big tv and music playing throughout. Great customer service from the people who work there and the free parking is a bonus, especially being in north park (we all know how that can be). I will continue to bring my clothes here.</Text>

I came across this Laundromat through a friend of mine. He mentioned they have same day service for washing and folding clothes. I had to be out of town in 2 days, so I decided to come in and give them a shot. I spoke to the clerk there named Kim and she was really nice about everything. I stated to her the urgency of my situation and so she mentioned that they would have my clothes ready that night. She even called me and placed everything in my luggage. Really outstanding service and friendly staff!!<//text>

<Review>Sorry it took a while to post a review. I came to park blvd laundry and dry cleaning last week (11/05) while visiting family in the area and I must say this is one of the best laundromats I’ve been to! The staff were accommodating and greeted me as I entered and asked if I needed any help with anything. The tv and free WiFi are nice additions as I can look at my phone without using data and watch tv while I wait for my laundry to be finished.

This is a lovely laundromat!   It's clean, never really too busy, has plenty of parking behind the building, and they usually play awesome 80's music :)  I'm actually starting to enjoy laundry time.<//Text>

Prices are a bit on the higher end, but it's worth it to have a warm (not scorching) environment to do physical activity. Also there seems to have been upgrades as of late, there is a new television playing music videos and the sound is wired to different parts of the establishment.</text>

<text>I was staying at a nearby AirBnB when I decided to check this place out to do my laundry. I walked in on a normal Saturday and I instantly noticed how great it smells and how appealing the place looked. I was greeted by a young lady named Maria and she explained to me all that I needed to know to do my own laundry. She helped pick the correct 3-load washer and helped separate my colors and whites. She even added the Wi-Fi password to my computer so I could do some work while waiting for my clothes. The service here really stood out to me and they are super friendly. I really enjoyed coming here and will be back the next time I'm visiting SD!<//text></record></dataset><record>

My father who is visiting for the holidays just attempted to bring several shirts for dry cleaning. As his ticket was being written a woman came over and stated there is a $20 minimum so he couldn't get his shirts done. I live in Banker's Hill and you'll never see me patronize this store. Poor, short-sighted business practice.<//review>

It has become our new neighborhood pot shop.
I like being able to run in and get something quickly.
They do not have a large selection tho.</text>

<date>1551744376161</date><Review>Okay, this particular dispensary is VERY close to where I live, so, clearly, it's the one I go to.  I've read another "review" of this place, which really turned out to be a review of their security having an attitude.  I can't speak to that, never having had any trouble with their security.  What I WILL say is that CPR Collective supplied me with good marijuana, without any trouble at all, for a price that I can't honestly evaluate, since I don't have a lot of experience with any other dispensaries.  What I bought IS good weed, and I thought the price was perfectly reasonable (remember, I used to buy my marijuana while it was still illegal, so I used to pay MUCH more than now!<//Review><UserId.>114235030344181885709< /UserId.><response>None</response><Pics>None</Pics><GmapID>0x80c29bb26a8c4edb:0xb15dfedef401ecb7<//GmapID></record>

Great shop, friendly and helpful staff. They have always taken care of me if there was an issue with a product. Best selection of vaporizer cartridges that I have found in the area. I always come here when i need more vape pen stuff.<//Review>

Horrible place their scales are off. I buy one top shelf 8th a week but when my car broke down and could only come here... I ended up buying THREE 8th's a week.
Something is wrong with this club because no other club has done this to me.
I lost a lot of money because of them ripping me off without even allowing me to put a dollar on the scales to check if it's properly calibrated.< /text>

Horrible. Used to come here weekly but now they extort their customers with made up taxes they don’t have to charge (yes even with the new legalization measures).<//review>

I purchased 2 CD's and sum stickers here and i really loved the prices that they had at this record shop. super affordable and convenient. The shop itself was super cool, authentic and well organized. Even the owner was super nice and helpful. I loved everything i got and I will definitely be returning :)<//Review>

Even though it gets hot in there since it’s a hole in the wall type of store, they have an amazing selection of vinyl and they also sell CDS & cassette. Their wall of patches is TOP NOTCH also. There used to be a life size Elmo suit laying out front, funny guy! If your a bit newer to the punk scene and your looking for some good vinyl, Rat Hole is your guy.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

The Last Record store in riverside (to my knowledge) great staff and collection of records. Mostly rock/punk oriented but they have a decent selection of other genres. Definitely a place I will become a regular of.< /Review>

Badly overpriced. He spends most of his time going onto Amazon when he rings you up to figure out what he’s going to charge you. The decor and selection is decent</review>

<Review>I have been to every vinyl record store between Temecula and Riverside, and "The Rat Hole" has BY FAR the best selection of records including new stuff, odd hard to find records, imports, bootleg, pristine 50 year old originals still in the wrapper with original price tags before bar codes were ever invented.   I went in looking for one record & left with over 20!  Staff is very knowledgeable & has very reasonable prices & this place is worth the drive.</Review>< name>

This place is a joke! Nothing is priced then they look up the highest price they can find on the internet plus the shipping I don’t pay because it’s a shop. Owner is impossible to deal with avoid at all costs< /review>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>Supper good selection. You can find anything here that you're looking for. They have records of every genre and in all conditions. It's usually pretty organized and easy to find stuff as well. In addition to records, they sell CDs, cassettes, and some posters though their selection of these is much more limited than the selection of records. I also recommend not using their parking lot, but instead the one in front of the furniture store. Rathole's parking lot is really difficult to get in and out of< /Text>< username>

Awesome shop with tons of great vinyl. This little shop in Riverside just might be the coolest place in the entire city, or the surrounding area for that matter. Truly a one-of-a-kind and unique record shop with an impressive collection of vinyl across many genres: rock, jazz, goth, punk, oldies. I’ve seen stuff here I’ve never seen before - and I used to work at a record shop!

I could easily spend hours here. Mind you it’s got stacks and stacks of records so come prepared to dig!</review>

The selection is huge for the size of the store... and it's not a tiny store. There is a wide variety of genres, with a little emphasis on rock and pop. But I've seen great soul, country, and jazz items here, too. It has better hours than a lot of independent record stores which usually close by 6pm. The Rat Hole is open until 7pm five days a week.<//text>< pics>

I checked out Rat Hole Records yesterday for the first time.  I met Chris at the door, who was really cool right away and welcomed me and my son into the shop.  Great selection of vinyls, tons of stickers and patches, and a very authentic feel.  Seems to cater largely to punk rock, which is great because that's exactly what my son and I came there for.  Chris is willing to help promote local bands and even indulged me telling him about one such band with a similar mascot to the Rat Hole Records mascot.  I would definitely recommend coming down and checking out the shop if you've never been there before.  I know I will be back to buy more stuff from Rat Hole Records soon enough!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Real music for real people, so much vintage inventory and for great prices. I went here once and now it’s the only record store I go to. No censorship, they have everything you want. And not just records or cds, huge selection of patches, stickers and vintage shirts.< /Review>

Great to have a used record store in riverside. Prices are kinda high, the selection is not that vast, but also gotta give some slack because they are relatively new.<//text>

Guy helping me was very friendly. I went with the ceramic with lifetime warranty! My car came out good! The only thing is they had run out of the warranty cards for the film, so the only warranty I have is what’s written on the receipt other than that I would recommend this place to anyone. I live in San Marcos and drove here to get my car done.</text>

DON'T GO HERE!!! I came to get my front windshield they charged me 220 on Saturday August 17. Come Sunday there's already a crack on the corner of the windshield that they have just installed, the car hadn't been! Driven since i picked it up from the shop. I took it in on Monday the guy tried to tell me that my window crack was caused by a rock! How? They will scam you don't go! They will not own up to their mistake. We will report this to the better business bureau.</Text>

They are very nice a professional. I’m very pleased with my window tinting on my Toyota Sienna. The intensity of the sun has been cut down drastically with the windows tinted. They said it would take about 4 hours and they delivered in a timely manner. Would definitely recommend and return.<//Text>

Rabie helped our family get an alarm system after someone broke in our car. He was honest and didn't try to oversell us. I would recommend him to anyone. Thank you</text>

Terrible work, I have no one to blame but my self for going here. I wish I would have looked at yelp reviews  instead  of Google. These Google reviews must be from friends and family.They used  a cheap adhesive spray on all my windows and now all four of my windows are stained. When I took it back I was told It was the car (Brand New I might add). And I would  be charged again for the work. 300.00 Loss.</Review>

Since I paid them for a mobile install I have asked them to come back to check out what the problem is. I've been waiting over a month,  and after 4 different phone calls they still have not shown up to fix the problem after saying they would.
I would not recommend this company because they do not stand behind their work.

If I could put NO STARS I would. Managed to DENT the hell out of my driver side door and CHIPPED the paint when all I asked for was to get my stereo fixed.....which they didn't do. When confronted about it the owner decided to play stupid with his employee and deny it. Owner acted like a spineless child using the blame game on the customer. Took my car in perfect conditions there. If you want your car damaged go ahead and go. Currently in the process of SUING THE OWNER.< /Text>

<Review>This place is beyond awful, manager treated to fight me.

Came here last year and auto glass replacement was a failure. But the car broke down before I could bring it back.

Came back a year later and they broke my rear view mirror and acted like it was always like that. Called the police to file a report. Manager threatened to fight me after I tried investigating. This place is beyond terrible.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

I went into the shop needing a windshield on my bmw and i saw they had there special $98. I was scared they were going to damage my leather seats, but they did a clean job. I was impressed with the price and their customer service. i recomend them to anybody who is looking for windshield or window tinting. thanks brian!!!!!< /text>

<Review>DONT COME HERE!!!! I came here to get my windshield replaced. at first they had order the wrong year so I had to wait another week. when I took it in the guy was taking off the windshield OUTSIDE the back garage in a SUPER WINDY day. this place is surrounded by nothing but dirt. I thought they will clean up all the inside from all the dirt but they didn't! not even the dashboard!!! ITS A BRAND NEW CAR!! I will rub my hand in the seats and it felt nothing but dirt!! My interior is a light color and its fabric not leather, the guy was touching around (the seats, side of the door, arm rest and the top) with his dirty hands which left stains everywhere. I took it back and the guy refuse to clean it!! even the dirt all over my dashboard. That was not it, all the plastic top seal around the glass was sinking in between the glass and frame. I took it back and the guy said DONT EXPECT TO BE PERFECT AND CLEAN JOB, its a china glass. basically he said you get for what you pay!! The inside of the car around the windshield was damaged, I don't know how the guy pulled it out, but the tool damaged the frame from the inside, again ITS A BRAND NEW CAR!  Last thing right after they took my car to the back I remembered I left my purse there, I asked the guy if I can get it, he took me through the back and guess what? they had KIDS working on a TINTING WINDOWS with garage door close. its a family business but they have their kids working. kids don't know how to be careful with scratching cars, specially if its a brand new car. any tools they can easily scratch it from the inside or outsdie. so if you want kids to tint your windows and touch your car bring it here, they will do it for you with no problem!!! I told him I want the original glass now from the dealer and he said ok its $900 to keep me shut, ha is it made out of gold? because in the dealership with labor is $550. I should of took it there but I wanted to save money, very unhappy with the work and customer service, the owner walked away after he refused to wipe down my car from all the dirt the wind brought. BAD PLACE TO COME!!!! DONT COME!!!!!!! after they take your money they basically say F*** you.</Review>< Pics>

Terrible experience. my food had hair, when i called and expressed to the owner she said input it in there. i poured the salad for the pupusas in my plate from bag that they gave me. she will not give a refund. i am calling health department also, while the lady was back there it was another person coming in and out picking through the food with her hands, going in and out of restaurant. the beans was very salty and the rice was heated through the microwave, the rice tasted like it to was old..

I had the Chicken, with Orange sauce with marinated Onions with Green Pepper. With a side of Refried Beans an Spanish Rice. It was excellent. I was pleasantly surprised. I was in El Salvador for a short layover recently. I did manage to have Lunch there. Masahuat was just as good. Two thumbs up. I really liked it.<//Text>

Worse customer service from this place. I called to order for delivery around 7:35pm today and they tell me they don't deliver but they advertise free delivery🤔. Then I decided to give it one more chance and I call again around 8pm to order for pick up. Lady tells me they are Close! But they advertise they close at 9pm.  Extremely disappointed at the poor customer service from this eatery.< /Text>

<review>I first stepped foot into The Barbers Inc Southside back in 2017. once I walked in great music was playing, people were laughing and the place was just pouring chill vibes. I was greeted by Gomez The Barber, he asked me to take a seat and he’ll take care of me. And from that point on it’s nothing but good times and great laughs. He’s come a long way from when he first faded me up to now. He takes his work serious and makes sure his clients are taken care of. If anyone is looking for a great cut check out Gomez the Barber @ The Barbers Inc Southside.< /review>< pictures>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Last week (6/16/2020), I got a haircut from a barber named Tawnie. The barbershop is temporary closed due to the pandemic. I had to go to her place to get a haircut. Last time I got a haircut was three months ago. It was very long due to the stay at home order. Appointment with her was actually challenging. She had other commitments. I was patient. I let her focus on her other commitments. What matters is that I got a haircut from her. I feel much better now with short hair.</Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x808e3256da84f7cb:0x88b08ab937b7b294< /GmapID></record>

<Review>First timer - walked in just before closing.  Staff were very friendly, very patient.  Barber Vicky took the time to do a careful job even though it kept her past the shop's closing time.  Very customer oriented. Overall good experience.< /Review>< UserId.>

Hands down one of the best cuts I’ve got in a long time. It’s a nice clean barbershop all around, and good vibes from the moment you walk in. Shoutout to everyone in there for the great professional service, especially Dot for for the fresh taper and waves!<//Review>

(Thia review for the dude Gomez) I came in for my first time to this shop for a simple line up. Long story short, this guy totally messed me up. He f****d up ny hair line and gave me some queer shape on my sideburns that i didn't even ask for. On top of that he didnt even offer me a discount except he gave me a "my bad".. never coming to this location again. The barber shop in Downtown is much better. They talk less while cutting your hair so they don't actually waste your time.. real bad experience<//Text>

<Review>Gomez Worst barber.He doesn't listen what you tell him. So unprofessional!!<//Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1541902538408, 'text': "Mehari,\n\nWe apologize that the experience was not up to par with your standards. Gomez did offer you a free haircut and told you that you didn't have to pay to atone for the miscommunication.\n\nAfter you decided to pay, then call the shop later for a refund, he offered you a refund again. Yet you insisted not to accept the refund he offered. We still want to make it right and offer you the refund or free service that's still on the table.\n\nFeel free to contact myself at 408-396-1919.\n\nThank you,\n\nDave Diggs"}<//Resp>< GmapID>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I met Teresa and Nick when I got to the office and they gave me great options for my storage needs and showed me some really great ideas for protecting my items. I ended renting a 5X10 which was perfect for what I needed. Teresa took her time and went over my items and got me the perfect space. She gave me excellent tips on how to stack and saved me money. I filled it up to the top like she recommended and it was perfect. I love the locking system. It's much safer than most places. It's a little different but worth it for my peace of mind. Also reasonable insurance options that won't break the bank. Clean facility and climate controlled is a plus.
Thanks Teresa and Nick for helping me.</Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Was looking for a small storage space for my things after moving and got the best help I’ve ever had from a young individual named Leslie! Made everything fast and simple and easy to understand! Not only that but the storage space itself was extremely nice and well kept. This is definitely worthy of a 5 star review! Keep up the great work!< /text>

Ask for Theresa! She is the kindest and most helpful service provider. I didn’t need this storage unit for very long but I know where I’ll be coming back to when I need storage in the future.<//Text>

<Review>Leslie was so helpful.  I had a last minute storage need and she was able to help me find a solution.  I'm so grateful.  The storage facility is well organized, clean, friendly and they don't try to gauge you on the price.  It was relief to find this place.  I highly recommend it if you have any storage needs.<//Review><Date>1604433825431< /Date><name>Ronald Salzillo< /name><Rate>5<//Rate>< pics>

Their payment schedule is inflexible.  1st of the month. My check comes on the third, so each month I'm overdrawn for a day until the check comes in. Can't be good for my credit score.

And if they post early and/or my check comes late (rare but it's happened) I get an overdraft fee from my bank.

Anxiety producing. (And no, I don't have enough money to get ahead of this by leaving $500. just sitting in the bank to cover the next month's bill.

The people working there are wonderful, helpful and sympathetic but corporate makes the rules.</review></record>

Why do you have a awesome staff over here at public storage they make life pretty easy they’ll call you before you get a late fee they won’t get you locked out Leslie Barbara Esmeralda will take care of you a great customer service highly recommend the storage facility over all the other public storage is and always has availability and easy access to your storage so if you need a storage you got to come to this public storage because they have Leslie Esmeralda and Barbara working here so if any supervisors read this I highly recommend you give them a raise<//Review>

I always purchase my packing supplies from public storage. The boxes are so sturdy and reasonably priced, especially when you purchase in bulk. The clerk at this location was so helpful and pleasant, she made great recommendations and helped load the boxes into my car.<//Review>

<text>I want to thank Teresa, Robert, and Felipe for their outstanding communication and customer service skills. They are very efficient and knowledgeable.

I would like to thank Teresa and Esmeralda for their expertise, their patience,and compassion for me and my brother!!!!  Teresa helped me tremendously yesterday trying to find another small space.  She went out of her way as always....when you walk into this building to make payments Teresa and Esmeralda welcome you with the smile and are both so kind!!!
Teresa, I will never forget the kindness you showed my 94 years old brother each time I brought him around.  We feel so safe entering this building!!  Felipe thanks to you as well for your kindness and generosity!!!< /text><pictures>None</pictures><user>111025415531841307253< /user>< rating>

Both Esmeralda and Miguel were very professional, courteous and outdid themselves as far as giving the best customer service possible.  Esmeralda  was extremely knowledgeable and helpful ensuring we had the most appropriate unit for our needs after asking specific questions when we phoned in for information. The actual visit was very brief as we just had to sign the paperwork after viewing the unit so it was a very good all-around experience.<//text>

Perfect when you're moving and you need some extra space.  The units are easy to access, and you get your own private code for security.<//Review>

Great service & they answer calls quickly and efficiently. I wanted to see how big of a space of a storage unit would be and was able to get dimensions and capacity. Very fun, friendly and attentive. Also, Gabby was always ready to answer my questions and give me a tour of my new unit.</Review>

< Review>
I went in two days ago to rent a storage. Great energy. Received lots of help from a young lady named menely. She had no need to help me move my things around and she still did. It's good to see that there are some people who still enjoy their jobs. Big beautiful smile she deserves 5+stars.
Great team. I will absolutely recommend this location.< /Review>

I used Public Storage for over ten years and had a great experience with them. This year my family was in search of self storage facilities in the Los Angeles area. The PS site at 5500 San Fernando was/is right for us and will be right for you! The facility is clean and the associates who work for the facility are knowledgeable and helpful. The attendant named Robert has been superb and has gone out of his way explaining the nuances of my contract with me and the supervisor/manager, Mr. Gomez has been extremely responsive to our needs as customers. I and my family travel extensively inside and outside the continental United States and need service we can count on. The price is right, the people are right....put your belongings and your trust in Public Storage.< /text>

<review>Manely is amazing! She helped us find the perfect sized storage without hurting our wallet, and she helped us get all the materials we almost forgot we needed. She was a great help, and the facilities are very clean and safe. I feel confident having a storage unit here. Also love that they have temperature control!!!<//review>< pics>

This place is clean and the staff is really friendly-smiles everytime. I have used this location a few times and the service and space is constant.  Happy place plus Golden Road is across the street so you can get a bite and drink after a long move or just popping by.< /Text>

<review>This public storage is the cleanest location and by far the prettiest. It’s pretty large and has the nicest staff; they’re extremely helpful and approachable too. I’d highly recommend choosing this location as it’s not crowded by other businesses and right off the 134 freeway.<//review>< user_name>

And second: the little units sit above bigger units, so if you plan on putting heavy objects in there, ensure you can comfortably carry it up a flight of stairs and lift it into a space on your own</Text>< Response>

Teresa, Jerry, & Robert are so kind. I have had my belongings stored at this location for almost 2 years. The location has always been clean, and more importantly safe. The fact that you can't even access the building without a code is a major plus. I appreciate that while traveling, I have had a place to store my important valuables without worry. This team has been amazing and I am grateful.</Text>

This is by far the best public storage I've ever been. While it's true that the climate system, and the security system puts it ahead of any other location,  what it really puts it ahead is its staff. They are by far the friendliest! Theresa and Robert are always with a smile and willing to help.

If we keep renting from this location is because of the staff. People like Theresa, Robert, and the rest of the staff is what makes this location being the best.</Review>

Teresa, Esmerelda, and Robert are fantastic. I've been storing here for years and this is by far the best location around. Cleanliness is very important to me and they have the cleanest bathrooms around. I  would encourage anyone needing storage to  rent at this facility. Not only are they professional, but also hilarious and fun to be around. I find myself coming in just to talk to them.<//review>

The place is always clean and the staff is always friendly. Several times I've had questions and they go above and beyond with customer service. I had some insurance questions and they answered them and helped me make the changes to my account without any hassle. I have several spaces there and will continue to use public storage for my future storage needs.</Text>

I never reviewed a storage facility but have to say something about this location.  I have rented here since they first opened.  This place is the best!  The facility is by far the nicest, the best maintained, and the cleanest Public Storage facility I have ever used or seen.  You can’t go wrong on any level for your storage needs.  Thank you to Robert, Teresa, and Jerry for always providing friendly and awesome service.< /review>

<review>The people at this PS are so genuinely kind and friendly. Teresa and Robert were very helpful. And Jerry is the absolute best! He walked me through the whole process and I felt like I was talking to an old friend the whole time. I rarely experience customer service this excellent anywhere! The facilities are safe and clean. I reserved last minute but still the entire process was seamless from beginning to end. And when I pop in to get things out of storage they remember me and check to see if I need anything. Moving is such a task but this was by far the easiest part of my move and I really appreciate their effort and efficiency. Helped to make the whole process less stressful for me. Thanks!!!</review></record></dataset><record>

Theresa, Robert, Angelica, and Adrian (the staff) are so kind with their help! I really appreciate how nice and patient they were with me last week; setting up an account and process... especially when I was feeling rather stressed out and frazzled. It was towards the end of the day on the last day of the month and I could tell it was quite a busy day for them, but they were positive and good natured. Customer service and kindness goes a long way!! :)</Review>

<Review>First acquired a unit in August 2015 when we were moving because our building was being demolished. Was able to reserve a unit easily and quickly.
At the time needed a unit close to the door because there was so much stuff to bring in. Was accommodated nicely and have had the unit since. Now we needed to clear out the unit asap and was able to close the account quickly and without too much hassle.
Teresa was wonderful! She was extremely helpful and friendly, always a smile on her face and a great attitude! =D

Thanks Teresa you're awesome! 💕< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2c042cb447ce1:0xe149ddc361f060d3<//Gmap_id></record>

Adrian is amazing!  He listened to my needs, was empathetic to my situation, and was all around a kind pleasant human.  For sure will come back to this PS for my future storage needs.  I should also mention, though I do not know her name, the woman he was working with was just as sweet and caring during my stressful move.  Thank you both!<//review>

This Public Storage is wonderful all around. Teresa and her staff are incredibly personable and helpful. The facility is top-notch with climate control and great security. It's by far one of the cleanest Public Storage I've seen. I feel completely secure having my things stored here. I highly recommend this location.< /Text>

<Text>I’ve been a tenant of several SoCal Public Storage facilities through the years. This location sets a new, high bar. The facility itself is brand new, or a few years old at this point. What sets it apart is the staff. I visit my storage location several times a month, and the staff always recognizes me and takes a moment to greet hello. I have come to learn a few of their names through the last year and I can confidently say Jerry, Teresa, Jesse and Jazmin always make themselves helpful, approachable and have an A+ attitude. The service paired with ample parking, the brand new facility and the temperature controlled space make this the flagship Public Storage location.< /Text><Rate>5</Rate></record></dataset><record>

Everyone here is awesome, with amazing character and attitudes,  and are very helpful! Jerry and Robert, especially helped me from start to finish with the process of moving in and out of my unit. The building is new and clean, which is a plus compared to other facilities I’ve been to. I highly recommend this facility!</Review>

<text>Teresa and Jerry are two of the best public storage service reps there are. They make life easy and are very accommodating…  this particular location is always safe and clean. Teresa and Jerry reduced my worry of finding a safe place to store my valued personal belongings  and kept the process straightforward and quick. I was in and out and all of 15 minutes…  This is the best public storage facility of all storage facilities....</text>< date>

We backed a 28 foot trailer into the lot and easily unloaded our locker, and once again, the staff was on point, getting the gate for the driver, providing dolly support, etc.  Shout outs to Theresa, Jerry, Adrian, and Robert.

Because all the employees are usually very helpful. They are polite, respectful , and courteous. They are knowledgeable, resourceful, with plenty  of good ideas. And what's more, not one time did they ever make me feel bad when I got lost in a maze of never ending corridor and could not find  my storage space.</Text>

<Review>I have nothing but great things to say about this PS location.  They are one of the best and have an incredibly helpful staff.  Jesse helped me find a larger unit to help consolidate two smaller units I had and was able to answer questions about store policies and availability.  Patty and Seth were also helpful on subsequent trips back to cancel the older units and to answer other questions.  All around a fantastic experience outside the service itself which is providing me a place to store items that are too bulky for my apartment.</Review>< Gmap_id>

Better than expected. Usual 8% increase in rent after only six months, when inflation is running less than 2%, but then one is a captive because of the cost of moving.</text>

The facilities are clean and the staff is extremely friendly and professional. Teresa was very helpful with my Pod delivery and pick-up - she went the extra mile so I could work with the Pod after business hours. Best experience with Public Storage and highly recommend!<//review>

<Review>Clean, functional facility, friendly and helpful staff.  Much gratitude to Jerry and Seth for helping ease the workload.  I would recommend this particular location to anyone looking for storage, as it's probably the most well operated storage facility I've ever been to.< /Review>< rate>

Well about this location i love t. I was planning to stay just a few month until i would get an apartment to fit all my stuff but i was going to look hard for an studio that would be cheaper although i ended up staying now for about 2 years. It has it owns secure gated parking. You need a code to access or otherwise you wont coming after office hours and to be honest when i did the reservation to look at my garage robert i just wanted to let everyone know he is like the best in customer service. Cool ask questions and charismatic guy. I went with my girlfriend and now we both love this facility also it has climate control and its in good condition< /Text>

Today is March 13, 2020 and I've just rented a larger space in the same building into which I will transfer the contents of my other spaces and what a joyful experience it has been! Saying  that I was merely helped by  both Teresa and Robert would be an understatement. Teresa helped me a few weeks ago as I began to assess my space needs and to minimize the cost  and Robert helped me continue to assess the remaining aspects of my decision, all with great patience and solid information. This facility continues to deliver a clean environment, great access, and cheerful employees who even let this old lady gab at them! 😄

2016:
I waited for this location to open mainly for close proximity to my current home, but the bonus has been the customer service at this location. Everyone has been very helpful and accommodating every time I've been there. Thank you!</review>

My experience at Public Storage on San Fernando Rd. was excellent in every way. The facility was very clean, temperature controlled and well lit.
The staff there are the best! Teresa, Robert and Jerry went out of thier way to make sure I had everything I needed. They even drew me a map to my unit so I would not get lost. They were extremely friendly, helpful and efficient.< /text>

<review>Public Storage in Glendale was beyond what we expected. Very clean, spacious, and well kept. Robis, Amanda, and Oliver were the ones who helped me get a unit for my company and they were beyond helpful. They were very friendly, attentive, and made it an all around great experience. They remembered me when I came back and their customer service makes you feel like you matter to them. The prices are fantastic, you can't beat it, and the service is top notch compared to other storage places I've rented from before.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

This Public Storage has an amazing location complete with amazingly helpful friendly staff, especially the manager Teresa, as she goes above and beyond with customer service! The grounds both inside and out are immaculate and this location is climate controlled, what more could one ask for when storing your prized personal possessions. Thanks again Public Storage!<//review>

Esmeralda was highly detailed when discussing the options that I had and she was easily able to multitask and I never once felt neglected. Manely on the hand was very eager and excited at the thought of renting a storage unit. It shows that manely truly cares about her job. Congrats to the person that hired these two ppl. You we're right on with your decision. Bottom line I felt as though I was speaking to the two owners of public storage because they were both treating the business as if it was their own company.

If you are looking for a secure location and the best staff, Teresa, Robert V, Adrian, Rob, and Robert are the best, then look no further.  The climate control, updated locking system, and clean facility make this the best Public Storage around.< /review>

I recently rented a unit for a few months while I was moving in to my place. Facilities were clean and easily accessible - and the helpful employee Amanda was courteous and quick to help me out with my questions. Would definitely use this place again should the need arise!<//Review>

Ever since this new location opened up I have been treated exceptionally well. My go to guys are Seth, Jerry, Brandon, and Jesse, those guys are always very professional and make me feel like a VIP.

I'm sad to move out, I always came in and payed my bill and loved the service from Teressa and Robert amount the few. The facility is always clean around my unit and in the halls and all the cameras make me feel safer than the other stoatage facilities in the area. Great job guys keep it up!< /review>< Pictures>

<review>This is the newest facility in the area from Public Storage so it is very clean and everything worked.  The people who work there were courteous and attentive to my needs.  I would have given it 5 stars had I been told about all the fees (insurance for my stuff, the new lock you need to buy to lock your storage).</review>< Pics>

This place is nice and clean and the staff friendly. The one star rating is due to their corporate customer service and policies.  After a week I decided I wanted to put more in storage than I had originally planned. I called the location office to upgrade to a bigger unit. turns out, it isn't possible to upgrade a current (1 week in) unit. I have to get another unit with no move in discount plus still pay for the full month of the unit I've had a week. So basically pay for two units when I only needed 5 more feet of space.
I called the national customer service and was told the same thing. I explained that I'm trying to give them more money. They gave me the alternate choice to move out of my unit then get a different unit in 7 days. When I said this was horrible customer service the person asked if there was anything else they could do. I had to laugh. I said she could figure out how to make this work. She responded with "have a nice day" then hung up on me.
I called the new Extra Space just down the street. I had planned to move from an Extra Space location in LA to the Public Storage location as it was more convenient and their prices were good. Even though I'm an existing customer with Extra Space they still gave me a month free and will prorate the month at my old unit.
If Public Storage had figured out how to do this they would have had a customer for at least the next 2 years but now they've lost a customer forever.<//text>

I was very satisfied with the location, facilities and for the most part the staff was helpful, although they are very anxious to leave right on time. While I am very confident in the security measures taken, once I was actually moving in I found the constant need to punch in a code for the elevators to be very inconvenient. I was also disappointed in the fact that the dolly's are only available during office hours. I wish there was some other way the dolly situation could be handled.</Review>

We're so happy we have found a final storage place for our belongings. I highly recommend you change storage and use public storage on San Fernando

<review>This location is an Excellent facility.   But not the Glassell Park Public Storage.  That Glassell Park facility says that they're climate controlled, but don't believe it!  It's so hot and humid inside their main building that I had valuable keepsakes ruined.  It's especially hot & humid if you have a unit on their 3rd floor.  Like a sauna on hot days.

Called the company to correct.  Resulted in AC being turned on for a short while.  Then off again a few days later.  It's even off during these 90-100 degree days we're currently having in Los Angeles.  Too bad this one location is spoiling the reputation of PS.  HOWEVER, THE NEW SAN FERNANDO ROAD FACILITY IS  ABSOLUTELY   F A N T A S T I C !  Nice people, great facility.  Honestly cool Climate Control inside on all floors.< /review><GmapID>0x80c2c042cb447ce1:0xe149ddc361f060d3</GmapID>< Response>

I have been using public storage for years sunland and glendale this is the best yet! Climate control is wonderful helps to preserve items I have in storage the staff is absolutely the best! Starting with Jerry & other team members Teresa Jesse and Robert everyone is so friendly and helpful I live nearby and am in and out frequently I pay in person and its always a joy even though Im paying a major bill 😬LoL keep up the good work! You guys are the greatest!!</text>

<user_name>Dmitry Yarchuk< /user_name><Rate>2<//Rate><review>Have been using the storage space for a few months and today received a letter by mail with my NEW monthly rate.

Without any explanation they just raised my monthly rate from $211 to $237. And there is nothing you can do about that as the agreement actually mentions random price adjustments at any time.

<username>Doctor Bill</username><text>SCAMS. They run three scams here: First, they will jack up your monthly rate severely right after you go to the work and expense of moving in. Secondly, they hard sell a virtually worthless (but expensive) "insurance". Thirdly, they promote "1st Month Free", but it's just another bait and switch because after you sign, they just give you till the end of the month free. If you sign up on the last day of the month, that means your one month free = one thirtieth! of what you were misled to believe.

The facility itself is fine, but the unethical business practices are nothing but bait and switch.< /text>< gmap_id>

< Review>
The only complaint I have is I wish carts were available after hours, and I wish there were trash bins around as I am downsizing.  If it is after office hours when I am there to go through my things, I have to lug a huge trash bag, load it in my car and haul it off.

The staff is friendly and helpful.  A friend helped me move stuff into the unit.  He is tall, young and able to reach high places.  While it made it easier to get more stuff into the unit, I had to get a few of those things that were out of reach.  One of the staff members actually came to my unit and helped me get those items I couldn't reach so I wouldn't fall and risk injury.

That was greatly appreciated.< /Review>

<rate>2<//rate><Text>We moved to this property to weeks ago, it is a new property, but unfortunatly it is not clean at all , our storage is in the 4th floor, and the floor is always dirty, the elevators are always dirty as well , and so dusty. Can you imagine, that we never a trash can in the property?? First day while we were moving to this storage we saw trash on floor all over the place. And i was telling my husband, tenant should be clean and should not through trash on the floor. But day after day i realized thst no trash can in the place, so tenants finds it easier to through things on the floor.
I suggest tgey should clean every day, cause i see bunch of employees sitting doing nothing all day. We were dissapointed since we moved to this storage. We used to be in a different storage , so cleannnn, have very nice snd clean smell always. Elevators are super shiny and clean and sll floors as well. I do regret moving to public storage. Maybe if they stsrt cleaning, and putting trash cans at least near the elevators or in the lobby, would be good for them.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<Text>My experience:  I made a reservation online.  Within 30 minutes a personable woman named Teresa called me back to to schedule an appointment.  When I arrived she was ready to meet me promptly.  She gave me a tour of the faciity and my prospective stoage space a 10'x 20'.
She anwered my many questions patiently and she helped me register and sign up professionally.  I would like to commend the young woman manager Teresa as being an execellent representative for the Public Storage Company.  She is obviously intelligent, professional, patient,  and very experienced in her position.  Not to mention that while she was assisting me so expeditiously, she was also training a new worker.  I could tell she was also a good teacher at the same time and she multi-tasked easily.  Thanks so much Teresa !<//Text><name>Hank Posner</name><GmapID>0x80c2c042cb447ce1:0xe149ddc361f060d3</GmapID>< pics>

<review>If you're smart you would take your business elsewhere. We are paid up for the month and have been denied access to our unit for late exit but we had left a car there and came back for it and got in as someone was leaving and put our code in to exit. This was Monday the 25th of Jan and Tuesday the 26th we were denied access and escorted out even tho we are completely paid up keep that part in mind. We notified them Tuesday and said we no longer want to do biz there so we were giving notice that we would be out by the 1st. Well it's now the 31st and we still have no access and so they want to keep our belongings because they saw what I had. Nonetheless we want out but they won't let us leave. They said they are thinking about evicting us but we already decided with notice that we wanted out. Daniel Knipp the district manager is a ignorant power hungry kid who does nothing but contradict himself and he's never available for any kind of emergency nor do these people really give a Damn about returning calls in a timely manner. My personal advice is to RUUUUUUNNNNN! I have a feeling this is gonna get real ugly.<//review><user_name>LOLA Delacey<//user_name><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

The staff are very polite (but *not* helpful), the facility is clean, and fairly secure.  But they are VERY, VERY, serious about their rules (Think; stalinist communism, or the DMV).

They will *not*  give any warning ,  and they will *not* discuss the matter with you, They will kick you out at the, first discovered event  (I say discovered because people break the rules all the time they just don't notice )

You will be given *2 DAYS* to find a new storage, rent a truck, and move (I had to move three truck loads), or they will repossess or trash can your stuff.

Do not stay late !!!!!!!!!
Do not smoke on permis (even in the parking lot , you have to go to the sidewalk)
Do not leave trash ( and I mean any trash !)
Do not  use the facility trash bin ( you have to pack it out in your car)
Do not store any unacceptable items (I.E. furniture ONLY! )
Do not park overnight ( They will absolutely tow you )

Do not get LOCKED OUT ( if you do you have both stayed late, and parked over night a double whammy, and even though there is an on site manager, there is no way to reach her, you have to call corporate office.)

Any of these, will get you booted

I got busted for staying late, which I was told was " trespassing" and "endangering the life of the of [public storage] employes ".  and she was VERY much serious.

Now if you mind you manners , and watch you P's and Q's, you can store your stuff there ( I was paying 213.00 a month), but if you don't :(  It's there way -or- the highway.

So in my opinion it's better just to go down the street, there are plenty of places to store. (I liked Stor-All I had a pretty good experience with them.)

<Date>1524895586880<//Date><text>The inane security here will drive you insane plus it still pretty expensive for a small unit with insurance included (don't be fooled). You must use a code to get in the gate outside of normal 6am-6pm hours and then you can't get in at all after 9pm. In addition, you need to use your code to open the doors inside and to even get out of the gate from inside. What is this, Fort Knox?</text>< Pictures>

Don't store here. They gave me a false quote online and when I arrived it was a lot more. Reluctantly got it anyways. Then a few months later they raised it again by $21. Very shady.< /review>

<review>I am talking about this particular RALPH store.
The problem is the Manager. I am not sure why but every time I shop there he will be waiting at the exit back entrance, and when he sees me exiting he leaves. This guy makes me feel uncomfortable. I mean does he think I am going to steel or something??? He is totally paranoid.
Some of the employees are not pleasant and welcoming.
I have been coming to this store for 5 years and the former Manager was nicer as well as the employees, but now it's not. They better change their attitudes otherwise it should be changed. Unfortunately it's the only store in Fullerton where I reside.
Totally disappointing< /review></record>

There is a good mix of businesses here. Anchored by a Chase bank, Ralph's market and The Black Bear. There's a Ralph's gas station next door and the prices are lower than most. Plenty of shops in between (Google it). So next time you go to Hillcrest Park swing by afterwards and check it out 👍🏻<//review>

< Review>
Ralph's prices are a bit steep. Some dairy products that I buy are $1 less where I shop. Not sure why Ralph's is higher.  They all get their milk from the same dairy.
Parking is a bit of a cluster.< /Review>

<review>Great little shopping center. Be cautious of the parking lot. It gets busy and is a little on the small size. If you have a larger vehicle I’d suggest parking on the north side of the center by Chase. The lot is bigger and has less traffic.< /review><user>117762320011584974129<//user></record>

This center has Ralph's, Chase Bank, a ton of eateries, and a Black Beat diner. Love this place. Plus... it's across the street from the park which is a lovely place to enjoy lunch or a snack or time together.  Get over there and check it out. #enjoylifeitsfree</text>

<Rating>4</Rating><text>There's a Ralphs supermarket in here. Ralphs tends to be a better store than the neighborhood it's in, and this one's in a rather upscale neighborhood near North Orange County Superior Court. It has a deli with Boar's Head brand products, a bakery with fairly fresh bolillos, grinder and Kaiser rolls, and a friendly, engaging staff. All of the shopping carts are clean and none have game wheels.< /text>< Pictures>

They also have a Starbucks inside. There's also a restaurant that I like to get pho from, and there's a churroholic for your sweet tooth.<//Review>< Pics>

That's why I drive extra far to come here and shop at this Ralph's. Been shopping at this Ralph's for 30 years It feels weird to go to another grocery store where people aren't as friendly. If i could give this Ralph's  a 10 star raiting out a 5 I would.< /Review>< pics>

Usually as ralphs or stop in to get gas. Coffee place in the plaza has good coffee, at times live bands. At the start of end of the Fullerton loop depending where you started but great for post ride coffee.< /text>

It does take a lot to keep a business like this afloat and while making customer service your top priority, some may see this as challenging.

I utilized Chase ATM. Google posted that this Chase had  a drive through. I drove 6 miles out of my way, to be disappointed. I had to use exterior ATM located on the sidewalk. I'm disabled, difficult parking.  Did not appreciate being mislead. I love chase and was able to complete my transaction.< /Review>

Finally a park not full of bums. This park is great and is undergoing a lot of construction for some reall nice improvements that are well needed. Especially since it is a veterans memorial park i feel that it deserves the upgrade!</Text>

I come to this shopping center frequently and I like it. The parking lot can get a little congested when Ralph's is busy but other than that it's great. I've been coming here for 20+ years so I suppose it holds some nostalgia for me as well.<//text>
