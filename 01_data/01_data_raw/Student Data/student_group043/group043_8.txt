I dine in this lovely spot quite a bit! This is the best place to dine.  I go to this spot routinely. The meals are of high quality, the workers are welcoming and the prices are decent. I like eating in this place to have a decent dinner.< /text>

I come here for the lunch buffet.  The food is very tasty and affordable during lunch time.  I enjoyed the garlic naan bread and the chicken masala was very tasty.<//review>

The best Indian buffet in San Diego.  Large selection of deliciously prepared dishes for a fair price.
Spoke with owner, this location is permanently closed.  They plan to relocate in a few months in the same neighborhood.<//review>

They had the food ready on time. The food is great. We had the chicken Tika masala, alu Gobi, lamb korma, nav rattan korma, chicken tandoori, vegetable samosas, garlic and regular Naan. Yumm! If you use grubhub via yelp, keep in mind that when you order the curries, you have a choice to get rice (whole plate) or naan (few pieces). We ended up with a lot of rice and not as much naan.< /Review>

This site is my number one site.  Of all restaurants I know I love it most. I always suggests to my friends to go to this restaurant. Whenever  I feel like having a good meal, this place comes instantly to my head. fresh and varied  food and a large list of dishes.well mannered team, and great mood. Also important, the tariff is reasonable. I recommend this spot with pleasure.<//Review>

<review>We’ve been coming to Ashoka the Great for years.  Our favorite thing is the lunch buffet (closed due to Covid-19) because you get to sample things you otherwise may not try.  We can’t eat things that are too spicy and the buffet accommodates for that.  Favorites are the chicken tikka masala and veggie korma.

Service is always exceptional, and kind wait staff.
Today we’re getting a combo plate to take away.  So happy that they have made accommodations to offer a combo plate during Covid.<//review></record></dataset><record>

The food was good in taste and quality. very minimal spice. I would not recommend for people like spicy food. As a South Indian vegetarian I had very little options(mostly is North Indian type food) . Probably little better for non - vegetarians .< /review>

When we first got into this bravo restaurant, we felt our sky turned blue again, the Stars shone again. We had the best ever food in our life recommended by the best ever brilliant waiter Markus. This super talented guy was so friendly, his smile made our sky even more blue, the stars even more shining. He told us that his name means king, but we felt we were the kings. This restaurant, supa nica. We would no doubt come back again. Memeda.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Great food, service and ambiance. The best thing about this place is the authenticity and balance of spices and the sauce, which the soul of the entree. Their sauces are what each entree demands unlike one sauce with slight variations for all foods.< /Review>

<Text>The food at Ashoka the Great is amazing because everything is simply perfect. They have great salad, just the right deserts (not too sweet), spicy and not spicy meals (not too salty), fresh fruit, and tasty rice. Everything tastes healthy and fresh, cooked with love. This is the first restaurant where the water was enjoyable and didn’t taste like chlorine.
A round adventure!!! 🍀 🙏  🌈 🍀
This place should have a 5-star rating! It is worth every penny!!!
They have the best naan bread in the world because it is crispy, not burned, and it has fresh garlic with parsley. The customer service is great!!! We will come back and hope you will come to enjoy it too.<//Text><Resp>None</Resp>< username>

Incredibly delicious healthy food which will please the taste buds going in and the stomach once down, this food is absolutely killer!!! I travel all over the US and can hardly wait to return back the Ashoka, my favorable food anywhere in the USA. Healthy & DELICIOUS ☆☆☆☆☆☆☆ And I don't work there, but sometimes I wish I did! I wonder if the employees get free food when they work?</Review>

Great food. We went for the lunch buffet and it was fantastic. Great prices as well! The staff is pretty quiet and the atmosphere is also pretty quiet. Great vegetarian options for the buffet. My only wish is that they would label which dishes are veg or not. Either way, I asked they staff and they answered my question easily. We will be going back!<//Text>

Best mutton curry, oriya people like more as the gravy is light and mutton is cooked well.< /review>

Excellent buffet, both lunch and dinner. Good vegetarian options. Nice masala chai. Polite and professional staff. Comfortable atmosphere.

Edit: Dropped to 4 stars because fried veg foods are fried in the same oil as foods containing meat.</text>

We had a stop over here for lunch buffet today on the way from san Diego to our home place canada. This place has fantastic ambience and friendly customer service. The prices are reasonable for buffet and we all left the place with full satisfaction. I would definitely recommend Ashoka restaurant for those who are visiting san Diego.< /review>

<review>The luncheon buffet is exotic and generous. Great choices for vegetarians as well as meateaters. The service is really top level, even with the buffet. They have alert eyes in the back of their heads and seem to always be there whenever you need them but never bother you otherwise. Please tip accordingly!</review>< Date>

<review>Good and inexpensive Indian restaurant. I alternate between this one and Indian village cuisine. Indian Village Cuisine is a little bit less expensive and the food  is a little bit better, but the environment is poor. So I go there when I am alone or with friends who don't care about the environment, and I go to Ashoka when I need a place that looks better.<//review>< Name>

Excellent lunch buffet and the service was good.  Moderately priced and very tasty.  They had a good selection at the buffet, the typical chicken and ghost dishes as well as a few vegetarian dishes.  The skis are great.</Review>

We accidentally ended up at this place since all other places were closed for dinner. The food was exceptionally tasty with right spicy level as requested. The staff was courteous and quick in serving. Ambience is good. I've given one star less cos the complimentary  papadam they give before serving the food is cold and almost tasteless. Either they should improve the quality of the same or don't give it at all!< /Review>

<text>I've been here multiple times and been happy with the food. Prices are reasonable and food quality is quite good. I like their buffet option which offer both veg and non veg choices and fresh roti/Nan served on table. Service is good and quick and usually easy to get seated without much waiting period.<//text>< pics>

You can see plenty of dishes you will end up eating nothing because of tasteless food. We had eat only the Nan and rice as no Curry's where taste. Don't waste of money and time.</Review>

Very friendly service. We came for dinner on a Saturday and it was pretty quiet. The saag paneer was good, the tikka masala was delicious, but the best part was the kabuli naan. We will be coming back for that alone.<//Text>

All-you-can-eat-buffet... A friend of mine treated me today and I was FULL after 2 plates. Friendly, cordial staff, quiet atmosphere. Salads and dessert. Most of the time, I would be able to chow down 3 - 5 plates but I guess I was wrong this time... LOL</review>

<pics>None<//pics><Review>About $10 for lunch buffet. One dollar extra on weekends. The food is good. It's better than Annapurna. But still, they should make the spicy dishes more spicy. It was kind of disappointing how much flavor lacked with the curries. Thats a sad excuse for a spicy dish. They do have samosas which is really nice. And their tandoori chicken isn't dry at all. And theyre not as expensive as royal India.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>The food is not authentic at all. Decent service. I'd encourage one to try Chennai Tiffins instead, which is right opposite, if it's authentic Indian food that you're looking for ;)</Text>< Time>

<time>1552077187655<//time><Rating>5</Rating><Text>This Indian food place is def one of my favs. I have only been here for the lunch buffet and I think it's spectacular, though my knowledge of Indian food is somewhat limited. I mean, a buffet is always a good deal, and an even better one when it's only like $12 a person and fantastic food! The naan is amazing here. I think another personal reason why I like Indian food so much is I can eat a whole lot of veggies and not even realize it! I'm big on meats, I'm a super carnivore, and I generally shy away at veggies. But no more I say! I can eat veggies hidden in their delicious panang sauce, or some of it mixed in with their tandoori sauce dipped on some naan. Whatever it is, I'm one step closer to eating slightly healthier!<//Text>< Pictures>

Ashoka - offers a decent buffet. Price is reasonable. Food will be medium spicy. Naan and Paneer Butter Masala will be fresh and good. Tandoors and Biriyani can be improved much.

Gulam Jamun will be delicious. It will be soft and flavorful.

The restaurant has a good ambience too.. Neat and Clean. Calm and pleasant.</review>

<review>Not happy with the service and food.It was ok for food taste and buffet had very limited selection. Gulab jamun (dessert) was served cold when it is famous and tastes good while warm. Chicken in butter chicken had smell. You have to ask for Naan (indian bread) to be served when finished as they will not ask you for anything you need. Looks like they don't care about their service but just waiting for your check. Never again.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

When you go to an Indian restaurant and it's filled with Caucasians, you shouldn't expect authentic food. Ashoka the Great is just such a restaurant. This place is made for those who think Dr. Pepper is spicy.<//review>

<text>Don't bother. These guys are taking advantage of their guests who walk in. Like a spider lures a fly...

Wife and I went to have lunch here, walked in, ordered drinks -- walked up to the buffet to see what was offered...

Then walked out.

These guys are are not even trying to be a decent restaurant.
Something is wrong here.

Drove west - two miles or so down Miramar Road to Virsa Indian and enjoyed a wonderful Indian food buffet - for only $9.95</text><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Regarding the extremes in the reviews ( one star or 4 to 5 )
Wow, a very opinionated bunch. The exceptionally low ratings, sounds "fishy" to me... this establishment has been a well known favorite amongst many I have spoken to in the past 20 years. It may or may not be your all the favorite, but giving them a 1 or 2 star rating is most likely very misleading... aka untrue.</Review><UserId.>118055638132495177964</UserId.>< Name>

<Review>Pretty standard Indian food. We ordered the butter chicken, a lamb curry, mix tandoori grill, order of rice and some garlic naan... plenty for 3 people. Everything was good but I wouldn't call it great. To balance out that statement, I would say nothing was bad either.

FYI, the rice is ordered separately. Given that I would rather just order more naan.

Oh and there's a lunch and dinner buffet. check the menu for buffet days/hours. I'd like to come back to try their dinner buffet.< /Review>< pics>

Ashoka makes a tasty curry chicken dish. It's my favorite. The pieces of chicken (bone-in) are soft, moist, and flavorful. HOWEVER, the bones are not sliced cleanly. They are fragmented at the edges into dangerous splinters, and one has to spit them out while eating -- and some splinters are so small they are swallowed.

One person in my family broke a tooth on a bone fragment, and it's only a matter of time before one of these bone splinters perforates someone's intestine and a lawsuit is filed against the restaurant. That would be a shame, since the food is delicious. If they chop the meat themselves, I strongly suggest they find a professional butcher instead. If they already use a professional butcher, it's time to change to another one. A delicious meal is not worth an expensive trip to the ER or the dental surgeon.

No other restaurant I've visited (of any ethnicity) that serves bone-in chicken leaves bone splinters in the dish. Surely this situation can be improved.

I hope the owners/cooks at Ashoka are reading this. PLEASE, no more bone fragments!< /Review>

Pathetic food and very poor service.  If you are an Indian and looking for quality food, then do not even think to go there.  Food is very blend with no taste.   If you do not care for quality, then sure go ahead and waste your money.  Samosas are made of plain potato, no spice.   Naan is of very poor quality.</text>

Fairly good selection for lunch buffet at reasonable prices. I've been going to this restaurant for 15 years and it's still my favorite Indian restaurant.<//Review>

< Review>
They don't know what Dal Makhani is and how it should be cooked. Gulab Jamun was as cold as a ice-cream when it should always be hot. Staff is extremely rude and i guess they don't want or expect any indian to come. For them serving to non-indians is what they want to focus on because they at most times may not be able to tell if a dish is correct or not</Review>

I ordered food for delivery. The food arrived 45 minutes later than promised. The food came without silverware and was mediocre at best. The food was also pricey for the quality and quantity of what was being ordered.<//review>

<text>Ordered through GrubHub. Food took 1 hour 40 minutes to get to us. It was 30 minutes past the latest delivery time given. Food was room temp (not even a little warm) so it was not as expected. I was very surprised and disappointed rice was NOT included. Apparently it has to be ordered separately.  The flavors seemed good, not great. The Tika Masala was "ok", Tandoori chicken was bland and very dry, the naan was a little "sticky". Just not impressed. If we ever eat here again (doubtful), we will try on site to see if quality and service improves when fresh and hot. I rarely write a negative review, we just could not come up with a positive one, other than it fed a starving family that had been waiting far too long so it passed the "edible" test. We just don't understand the rave reviews this place has gotten.</text>< pictures>

<Review>Horrible!!! First of all the food was not at all tasting Indian. It had no spice, no salt no flavor. And moreover, if you are a pure vegetarian, please be careful. I went there for buffet. They had a vegetable biryani in a container. After eating little food, when I went there to take vegetable biryani, it was replaced by chicken biryani at same place where they earlier kept vegetable biryani. No proper labeling, no separation of containers and no quality. Not just me but some more customers unknowingly took chicken biryani instead of veg biryani.

Service is very poor and waiters were very rude on our feedback of this biryani container.

Not at all recommended.</Review>< Pics>

I used to like them more but seems they recently shrank their buffet menu by a few items and they also now have a 1 refill limit on sodas. Not my goto Indian in the area anymore.< /text>

This is more of the temple/church for Laos and Thais.
Thais and some cultural classes offer on Wednesday and Sunday.  On Sunday you can get many hard to find vegetables and ingredients from the local growers at very good price. Also, on Sunday and you can get very cheap and authentic Thai food too. I bought Thai BBQ chicken on a stick and sticky rice for only $2.00 each. Hard to find parking.<//Text>

Open to the public, amazing place to go and re-energize through starting quietly within. The library is open ss well with thousands of books dedicated to the teachings of Budda and modern take on the ancient art f mindfulness and meditation.< /review>

<time>1620157772335</time><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Text>I've had take out from this place at least once a week for the last 6 months

There's definitely some issues to discuss. Is there good cooking here? Well, it's certainly possible. There's been times where've thought it was pleasant enough. But the truth of the matter is, Mountain View has always been a dead spot for good Chinese cooking, and if you need proof, just walk down Castro street.

Dumpling Garden is a restaurant where there are moments. Moments where the food is fine, especially as they are comparatively more affordable compared to other Chinese restaurants in the area.

The issue is primarily in the lack of consistency and the clear evidence of skimping. If you order the pan fried dumpling, you'll find yourself biting into the air as only 1/3 - 1/5 of the dumpling has any protein stuffing. If you order take out soup dumplings, they'll conveniently forget the vinegar and chili or the chopsticks. The Thai tea will taste of 25% sugar and taste muted.

Off memory, in the last 6 months, you will more often come across at least one notable issue that diminishes the flavor of the meal. It never feels like there's intent to make the food taste poorly, but there is a feeling of nickel and dime-ing.

Maybe the dine-in experience is better, but the take-out leaves much to be desired.< /Text>< response>

< Review>
Stumbled upon this place looking for somewhere to eat after a trip to Walmart. My family loves dumplings and we're always on the hunt for good places to eat while in other cities.

We ordered a few typical dishes we would to compare to our local dumpling spot. The marinated pig ears were nice and tender with good flavor. The mustard green soup was okay. It wasn't hot, but the beef was good.

We also got lamb with Napa cabbage dumplings as well as for and chive. Both were delicious.

Prices were about $3 more per dish than what I'm used to, but it's not too bad considering I didn't see another dumpling spot in the area.<//Review>

<text>Delicious food! Especially recommend the Marinated Beef Pancake Roll and the Chicken and Corn Dumplings! It's true that the food was a little pricey and the skin on the xlb was somewhat thick, but the flavors were great. The Shanghai style rice cakes also had a great texture. We will definitely be back!</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPNf7JktIKuTBvKx07tpwThepMyyQgvBmTHnAY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOJiGwl-NLrLgAJRWVmdLccHq5egTpxqkvL9J8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgf0qzVNfgz1ylqeJLFjYnQIOdbX1mcunslfxA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< time>

Do not order from here if you would like timely food. Terrible service and honestly just go down the block. If you put some effort into at least handling orders in a timely manner I may leave 2 stars. Sorry but no.<//Text>

had ordered salt and pepper shrimp. Expected it something like that of panda express. Definitely dissapointed. It was majorly covered in some flour / starch or some other food material. There was little shrimp inside each piece. Also for the given price, i wont order again.

Update : i Kept the leftover food outside for 15 days, surprisingly it did not get spoilt.. unsure what it is even made of< /Review>

I really like this place to have a quick authentic Chinese meal. It is not big place but really popular even in late night. Service is kind and nice, environment is acceptable. I recommend popcorn chicken, dumplings and shengjian Bao for first trial.</text>

Dumplings were OK. Definitely not worth nearly a dollar each, since they were small. I'll give them another chance and try a different dish next time but given "dumpling" is in their name, it doesn't bode well.<//text>

<text>It's fine.  Nothing special.  Nothing is bad but nothing is particularly great either.  Had dumplings, xaio long bao, green onion pancake, beef stew noodles soup, garlic string beans, combo fried rice and combo chow mien.  All of them are staples.  They were all just ok.  Dumpling Depot in Sunnyvale is the same kind of place.  They're slightly better.</text>< pictures>

Shanghai Dim Sum was pretty good. The crab meat Dimsum on the other hand was not. Then ordered 5 spice beef, came out tasting like it was lathered in a jar of super salty peanut butter. Definitely overboard on the peanut sauce.</text>

Little pricey but so freaking good. The fried rice (ironically) took a long time to come out but ended up being worth the wait. Careful not to burn yourself on the soup dumplings like I did 😅</Text>

Fresh tender dumplings. Soup-filled dumplings melt in your mouth. Pork stew with yams was delicious! Spicy pork shreds had the right mix of meat, tofu skin knows, and fungi, spicy, but not too spicy. Cold sesame noodles with cucumber was the perfect balance.< /Text>

Some improvements:
egg pancake- egg should b salty/savory, less sweet
Lamb dumpling- improve meat texture, too tough and stringy
General tsos chicken- not tasty @ all
Green onion pancake- less oil please

Ambiance could be improved; such harsh white light<//review>

Bad customer service, the waiter ignored my family of four. At first, I thought he just missed us since he only gave the lady after us a menu, and then he saw me looking at him. He went to get another menu to the lady while looking at me and ignored us again. The waitress saw me, gave me four menus, and asked why he didn’t serve us, he ignored that question. After debating while, we decided to just leave, since he obviously didn’t want to serve us but only young girl.< /text>

<text>Dumpling garden used to be really bad but they have recently revamped everything and it is now a lot better! Some dishes I've tried:

- Spicy boiled fish: Their best dish imo. Really nicely seasoned fish filets, perfect amount of spicy vs savory. Fish is tender, and there is a lot of it compared to veggies. Also has wood ear mushrooms which I personally really like.
- Cucumber wood ear mushroom salad: Not bad but missing vinegar or some kind of acid. Sauce is soy sauce and garlic basically.
- Bok choy with garlic: pretty good! Has nice wok hei.
- Roast five spice chicken: Better than expected in terms of flavor. It has a super dry five spice flavor, and the dish is served cold. It is kind of in the style of chicken jerky as the chicken is pretty dry but that's just the style. Don't expect juicy chicken though.
- Chow mein: It's fine, but it's not seasoned well enough and personally wouldn't get this again.
- 3 flavor dumplings: Tastes similar to frozen dumplings you can get at 99 ranch. Aka, not too bad but nothing special.
- lotus root salad: I don't really like this as the lotus isn't very fresh and the flavor is very one note (basically salt).<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<Rate>2<//Rate><text>Ordered ToGo: dumplings, pot stickers, salad, and turnip pancakes. This was our first of many trips. Was moderately busy at 6pm with customers and food delivery folks doing pick ups.

Had a moderate rate, but that was likely due to our arrival estimation.  Other customers at tables did appear to be waiting for service.

Turnip pancakes were golf ball sized balls with sesame seeds. Was expecting flat, but they were good.

Plenty of parking, but an odd shaped plaza. Might be hard to see their sign from the street on your approach.

Update: downgrade to a 2 star. We had hoped to pick up an order at 5pm, and called during the lunch hour. Promised for 5:15pm, we got there at 5:18, and waited until 5:50 when our order came out of the kitchen.

The pancakes are good. Online menu says they are turnip, but inside menu says radish.<//text>< Gmap_id>

We like this place a lot. The xiao long bao are pretty decent, but I really like their noodles which seem homemade - they hold up to eating over multiple days! The beef pancakes are delicious. I would order multiple servings but that seems a bit too decadent even though they reheat well. I love their spicy sliced tendon - addictive!
We also really like the chicken corn egg drop soup (yes, American Chinese food) which is great when you have a cold.

Got there around 5, for amount of busboys they don’t provide a very timely service. For the amount of food you get is way too over priced. Over all i would say don’t even go there. Spend $30 i barely got full.</Review>

My family makes dumplings at home, so I'm really picky about dumplings. Dumplings here are pretty well made, but the broiling was a little overdone. Also the chive pancake (not a pancake) wasn't crispy. Seems to be a skill difference with the person who made the food, and the person who did the last step of cooking it.<//text>

<text>I went there ~10:58. The door is open and there are staff inside. I was told they’re not open yet, which is understandable since the opening time posted on the door is 11:00. However, I waited past 11:00, and they said the waiter is still on his way. I left at around 11:15, since no one take my order.   Apparently, they are working on a big takeout order - I can see a lot of to go boxes stacked on a table. Btw, this is a dumpling place and I saw a staff carrying a plastic bag of what seems to be bags of frozen dumplings. You can guess what that means.</text><date>1530822283902</date>< rate>

<Text>This place is really good. New owners have brought a more rustic style of northern dumpling, but the lb and sjb are still solid. As well and the szechuan style like cumin beef. Can't really go wrong here, although the old school might consider the process a little high, they are ok. Go!< /Text><Response>None< /Response>< time>

< Review>
In a family with Dumpling Depot and it's Palo Alto sibling... I'd say this is the best one. It least the menu is the most extensive in a good way. TBH the regular boiled bore me, so the Sichuan spiced wantons and pan fried Shanghai dumplings make.it worth it.</Review>

Overpriced in general. Check their menu and prices before you come. Dumplings are mediocre. XLBs are OK but thick skins keep them far from being authentic. Sesame noodles are surprisingly good.</review>

<Text>Not bad dumplings with average other dishes. Where you can find most category of Chinese food (dumplings, soup/fry noddles, rice dishes, stir fries, cold dishes, Chinese pastries, etc.) in one place.  A bit pricy.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<text>Above average potstickers....not great service. And I say this reluctantly because they are so convenient for me personally. I've held off putting in this review in hopes the poor service I got was a fluke. Unfortunately they've consistently provided below average to poor / bordering on rude service.

For example, I asked for extra hot sauce and dark vinegar for the potstickers. I was told 'no' each time. Really?

They said food would be ready in 20 mins. Having had to wait in the past I gave them 30 mins. Food still not ready. I asked how long. They said waiting on one more thing. I'm like ok.....I waited another 10 mins. Asked again. The person behind the counter instinctively just said 'waiting on one more thing'. What????? It's like that's their default answer.

I finally asked him if he could actually go to the kitchen and check. Well what do you know he comes out with the final part of the order.

Kenny if you are reading this, I'm sorry but your restaurant has got serious service issues. I wish you well but you guys aren't the only place in town.  After tonight you've effectively lost a once loyal customer.< /text><Rating>1</Rating>< Resp>

Dumpling are okay, but do NOT order "孜然香脆小⻩鱼 Crispy Yellow Croaker w/ Cumin", too much flour, definitely not traditional Chinese food<//Review>

< review>
(Translated by Google) Super delicious, hot and sour soup, onion cake, dumplings, Shanghai fried omelet are delicious ~ ~ and hand-made frozen dumplings can buy! Easy to ignore in plaza comparison
They are dumplings and dimsum in house. Pretty cool to see they are making dumplings while I was eating. They have more dishes besides many kinds of dumplings. My fav are green onion pancakes w eggs and the hot &sour This place is a little hidden tho, right by the car wash.

(Original)
超級好吃😋點了酸辣湯、蔥油餅、水餃、上海生煎包都好好吃～～還有手工冷凍水餃可以買！在plaza比較裡面容易忽略

<Pics>None<//Pics><UserId.>109251459689622529612<//UserId.><text>(Translated by Google) The dumplings and casseroles are delicious. Snacks such as shredded carrot cake are delicious. Not American Chinese food. The only criticism is that we are not allowed to sit when we have a seat, because the seat is a multi-person seat and we only have two people. This is unreasonable, obviously, we can share a big table.

(Original)
饺子和砂锅好吃。萝卜丝饼等小吃美味。不是美式中餐。唯一的诟病是明明有位子的时候却不让坐，因为位子是多人位子而我们只有两个人，这不太合理吧，明明可以share一个大table。<//text><Name>YiYou Lin< /Name><gmapID>0x808fb0a4549331c5:0x4b5726dd50b48da3< /gmapID><response>None< /response></record>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The store is not big, but the dumplings are really delicious! In addition, the toilet has to go through the messy kitchen, which makes people lose too much appetite. . .

店不大，但是小笼包是真的好吃！另外不得不吐槽的就是卫生间要穿过很杂乱的后厨，让人降低了太多食欲。。。< /Text><userid>112124633976572979716< /userid><date>1554178618654< /date></record>

Let me get this out of the way: "C'mon Steve, it's just a mini Mart!!!" Ok, I know. If you could pick this store up and drop it off on a back road of Kentucky 50 years ago, it would be a winner. The middle aged Asian couple are just an absolute delight. This place is PACKED! Booze for years, winning lottery tickets cover walls. There could be ten people in check out line, but if the owner wants to tell you a joke, everybody waits patiently. Don't ask me about products, pricing, store hours etc. C'MON YOU GUYS!! It's just a mini Mart!!    Sometimes it's all about the character.</Text>

It's the only liquor store I go to because I've been going there for 14 years I know Sue, John Howard. And I refuse to go to any other liquor store because of the great hospitality I get from them they feel like family ❤️❤️<//review>

Cool hidden little liquor Store. Very nice owners it’s tucked away in the small complex - not easily seen. If you are a smoker, cigarettes are a solid .50 cheaper.  :)< /review>

I love this store. I just moved to the area and my neighbors sent me here for groceries. I was very pleased that the Owners were very friendly, personable, engaging, helpful and inviting. If I need a quick stop in for things, I'll always come here. Five stars and thumbs up 👍⭐</text>

<Review>Pitifully poor selection and they feel like they can charge you a dollar to use a card to pay.... highway robbery and they try to make you feel bad not paying in cash. Save your time and money and find a better establishment to frequent if you need refreshments. Maybe one day they will stop trying to shame people before stealing their money as a “fee”</Review>< Pictures>

Just got robbed in broad daylight...
Does not have a sign in the entire store that states they will charge you $1 for using your ATM debit card.. but he added an extra dollar when I went to use it... it's already expensive as it is... this store is close to my home but I will stay away from now on</review>

The owners son harasses customers by remembering what they buy (alcohol) and making fun of them when they leave to other customers. Horrible prices on everything, 99 cent store products are being sold 300% profit. Candy and chips are stale. Products being sold that are sun damaged and from the 1990's.</review>

Aside from being very knowledgeable and professional, they both went ABOVE & BEYOND to get my service installed. MANY thanks to both of you. You are both tremendous assets for the company and the type of employees that make a business a success. I hope that someone "higher up" in the company actually reads this and acknowledges both of you for a job well done........<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

< review>
People aren't too friendly. I just had to go there and replace the controlee and expected the guy to at least say good afternoon how are you doing. Or ask about what I was returning and why, but not. A nice clean place though I'd give him that. For the amount that you pay is like small car payment for a month , they should be a little bit nicer.</review>

This satellite store is nice if you go in person but if you try to contact them to get a simple question answered... good luck.  You will be placed to the comcast que from hell and still NEVER get your question answered</Text>

My experience with comcast has been I had a package that was roughly 70$ a month for roughly a year.  Then after a year they jacked lt up to 108$ and said we sent you an email saying the package expired.  When I questioned customer service on the price hike they told me comcast has to many customers to give anyone specific any actual attention.  After a frustrating phone call I went to a store to solve the problem in person.  There they informed me that to have the price I had before I had to decrease my speed.  I am now paying the same price for lower quality.  Customer service was fine everyone I talked to was friendly but all said that the issues I faced were company policy.  First chance I get to find a new company I will switch.  I gave two stars for the customer service trying to help but being unable to work with a conglomerate that apparently does not care about it's customers.< /text>

<review>This company has poor customer service, the office is too small, and they sneak extra fees into your bill without telling you upfront. Also, after doing a speed check multiple times on my internet, it reaches only occasionally what I paid for.  False advertising! Go with ATT or Syix instead!< /review>< pics>

They need to get their website hours corrected. Online it said they were open and I go to the store and it’s closed. There wasn’t even a sign for an explanation.</Text>

<GmapID>0x80db7de51c1838ab:0xc3aec1137bfd228< /GmapID><Text>Great place for small kids to come play. Each room has a different theme so the kids can play make believe in a fire station, class room, all the way to a kid sized gym. It didn't get too over crowded the one time I was there. Prices were reasonable for two kid's admission and the facility was decently clean especially due to the fact that kids play pretty rough here each day. Only suggestion would be the hours. Would be nice if they opened a little earlier then noon and stayed open on weekends. All and all, great place though for mom and kids to come play just to get out of the house.</Text></record>

I’ve been here TWICE and both times they were closed??? The first time a sign on the door, but they should post on the website, or at least their social media so parents don’t drive all the way there for them to be closed. I went again TODAY, and closed again. It’s supposed to be open play? Their own worker wasn’t even sure, and couldn’t contact the owner. Unprofessional. Was thinking of hosting my daughters birthday there, but don’t think I’ll be coming back at all🤷🏽‍♀️ There was also another family waiting as well to see if it would be open, because it was during open play hours.

EDIT: your site says suspended in DECEMBER. It is a Tuesday in January and I don’t see anything About MWF. Your website still say M-F 12-5 open play.< /Review>

Our website does say open play has been suspended and to ✔️for updates as well our f/b page does say when we will be open. We opened back up this week. Mwf 12-5.

3.5 🌟 We walked in and were greeted with a smile. The location was bright, clean and spacey. The kids had a blast playing make-believe. There were a few toys that were not functional or had no batteries. There is a play room that has a military boot camp theme. My issue, as a veteran is that they are only flying  4 of 5 military flags. Imagine Me Grow is a must do location for the kids.<//Review>

<Text>This place is amazing. Perfect for the 3-year olds we hosted for a party there. They played non-stop. And I was happy because it is very clean and safe. And the party options are great...you can pick and choose options to fit your budget and level of personal contribution. My son also loved the open play times. Overall I would recommend this place to ANYONE. Happy to have a place like this in the area.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>My 2 kids had a blast at this place!  My boy is 4.5 and my daughter is 3 and they both don't stop moving while they're here.  It is constant stimulation play interchanged with real life experiences.  It's a perfect indoor play place for children ages 2 and up!  Great for parties and gatherings!!  We held a painting party here over the summer and had plenty of room while others played in the facility without being bothered by our party.  Wonderful and accommodating staff who are always attentive and prepared.  Great job guys!  This is a "must have" for kids in the Murrieta/Temecula area!<//Text>< gmap_id>

<text>Hands down the best place to throw a kid party!

Our 5-year-old loves open play at this place. So naturally we knew Imagine Me Grow would be the perfect place to throw our youngest daughter's 1st birthday party. And boy were we right! It was completely stress-free and there was no mess to clean up afterwards.

We were allowed to bring in our own food/decorations; however, you can also purchase them through Imagine Me Grow. But regardless, the staff, which by the way, were the sweetest, helped set up our party decor and food/dessert stations. Oh, and they even took photos as well!

Also, most kid party centers do not allow you to bring in your own food so this was a major plus for us as our oldest has a couple severe food allergies.

But the best part of it all was that all of our guests had an amazing time. Everyone kept complimenting how fun and cute the place was. Some even mentioned they'd like to throw their next kids birthday party there.</text>< pics>

Fantastic place for kids birthday party!! My review is long overdue, as my son's party was almost two years ago, right after they opened. The owners were very accommodating and could not have been nicer. Last year for our son's party we tried something new but, I would love to go back this year to Imagine Me Grow.< /Text>

<text>It was fun for ages 1-9 but any younger there isn't really anything to do and they still charged you. We had a 10month old baby and they charged us. He didn't even play. So for 4 kids it was 30 and the place isn't very big. Better off just doing it as a birthday party not for Open play.< /text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

My children love coming to Imagine Me Grow because they can do just that...Imagine! They can be a fireman, a DJ, a chef, or whatever their hearts desire. It is a very bright and clean place, which is important for me as a parent. Definitely will be taking my children here more often!<//review>

I had a lovely time celebrating my youngest 1st birthday at Imagine Me Grow. All the kids at the party had a blast!!! My private event was PRIVATE and i loved it!!!! The only thing that wasn't it for me but the kids loved it was the kids pop lol the host and I joked about the music so many times. The host was also amazing, really sweet young woman. May be hosting another event soon.<//review>

Nice place for the kids to play.
Was hardly anyone there when we went. They are only open a short time during the day. By the looks of the sign in sheet only 6 people had been there all day.
Honestly I don't know how they pay the rent, must be some kinda money laundering operation....<//review>

Wonderful fun play stations! We attended a birthday party here today for a classmate of my son. 4/5 year olds and their siblings were welcomed and allowed to play and explore. It reminded me of a  children's pottery barn catalog brought to life! Very sweet moments as my son and friends served one another in the bakery and sea food restaurant. My younger two loved the fire station very much. The cars can be pushed around the road and this was a please t surprise. The dance room was often empty but once in a while the children would enter and burst into dance. It was fun! Each room has a small screen tv with the rooms topic playing on the screen. At first I felt this was unecessary but as the party progressed it made sense, and had no sound so it wasn't intrusive to their imaginative play.

A music room would be fun, but trust me the kids were very satisfied and the play kitchens, fire station and dance room seemed to be my three boys favorite.

If I had to give any critique it would be to share that it is not a tactile/sensory experience as it is very clean and free of any sand or water play. That is understandable as it accomadates cooperative play amongst many children, young children. The environment fostered cooperative play and surprisingly allowed children the freedom to cooperate and play individually. I highly recommend!

In a time where children play centers resemble casinos and bars, and are often filled with video games this was refreshing!

Created for the younger child I find it sweet that they are not bombarded with flashing lights and bribery of candy and cheap toys. If my older kids were with me I could see them getting a little "bored" but I would encourage them to play and pretend with their younger siblings and I know the entire family would be better for it! So often we spend time and money to celebrate our children but we end up just consuming and teaching them greed and consuming. This truly fosters imaginative play that will help families bond, social skills flourish and develop life long memories.</Text>

<Text>Our kids love the place, it’s different than other Yogurt places in town .. it’s also located in Canyon Crest Town Center next to Starbucks...if you have not been here bring your kids or grandchildren... ENJOY...<//Text><resp>None<//resp></record>

<Text>Very good selection of great tasting frozen yogurt. Stopped in yesterday while letting my grandson play in the water feature out front (yes, that's its purpose). The selection was great with typical lighter summer flavors. I opted for the watermelon and dole pineapple. Typically, I've found almost every frozen yogurt place makes the watermelon very tart, this wasn't the case here. Paired very well with the pineapple and added some yogurt chips for a little texture and neutral sweet punch. Their fruit toppings looked a bit less pleasant, so I skipped on those. All in all I'd say they're a 4 star easy.. Clean, great flavors and priced right.< /Text><username>Doc Chop<//username>< pictures>

Unique ice cream flavor but very good. The texture of the toasted rice is fantastic. This little ice cream shop is pretty cool. I really enjoyed the taste of their ice cream cones as well. I cannot wait to come back again.< /Text>

<review>Place is great. Always clean, never seen a machine out of service. all the flavors are good and pair well with the adjoining flavor purposefully. cute merchandise, rotating discount schedule. miss the old stamp card, phone app loyalty program is odd. guess your cost day is honestly a waste of time, you aren't making any sales with that gimmick.

Nice quiet place to go and spend time eating yogurt especially after loud and crazy day. Toppings are priced by weight. There are seats inside and out. We enjoy being outside in the sun so this was a perfect place for us.</text>

Very nice location. There's a little fountain outside that's good to sit buy with not bad music playing. Inside is pretty nice too. Yogurt is all self serve with tons of flavors and toppings. I made a mistake and got the chocolate though--I guess chocolate yogurt doesn't agree with my taste buds. My sister's cookies n cream was really good though. Prices are by weight so fill as much yogurt as you want!<//Text>

Came here for the first time last week with my fiance.  We enjoyed the variety of yogurt and toppings.  Store was clean and the gentleman behind the counter was friendly.< /Review>

Clean little frozen yogurt shop with great service. My only complaint is the yogurt is a bit watery, flavor is always great though. If your looking for a cold treat be sure to stop there.</Review>

<Review>The place is clean and pretty and my family loves frozen yogurt! I live a couple blocks away and this was my first time in, nice service, Excellent choice of Flavors! it was about 3 p.m.not too warm outside but inside the shop was so very. very hot!.... too hot to stay very long! I wanted to fill more containers with yogurt but couldn't take the inside heat,  don't understand why there was no  A .C. on, Hope to stop in agian.....</Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<review>I like them, indeed they are really good almost one of the best sweet yogurt places in Riverside. The add-ons tho are even better sometimes I am going to have those on top. I highly recommend them, neither so sweet nor watery. And if you are a Ucr student probably they’ll give you a discount.
There are fountains outside if you want to enjoy siting outside.
But it’s like 3 years that I am going here, they never changed anything, no new taste has been added so far.</review>< Pics>

<review>After finding myself in the beautiful Canyon Crest Towne Centre, while appraising some of the local parks in the area, I stumbled across this indigenous froyo vendor.  Looking too cute to pass up, I inspected the flavors on tap, and was stunned to get an eyefull of Green Apple.  I've never come across anyone else brazen enough to flaunt this tart tang.

So I loaded up a small ole cup with pomegranate, tart, mango and green apple... topping it with my favorite dry cereal from a long running cartoon series... yes, Fruity Pebbles.  I normally carry a baggie in my pocket, but today I had my Hawaiian swim trunks on, because I was going jogging at the park, and had forgotten my awkwardly small compression shorts in the next state.

But my lavish topping splurge didn't stop there.  I also adorned my dessert with fresh blueberries, sliced strawberries and kiwi, some mochi and topped it off with a maraschino cherry... which I topped with a single raspberry... which I then topped with a dollop of raspberry syrup.  Genius!

After I gingerly placed my creation onto the scale, the sales associate asked me if I cared to guess the price before tax, which if assessed properly, would allow me to walk out without paying one red cent (plus tip)

Sitting outside, I enjoyed watching the toddlers playing with each other in the courtyard, thinking about all those sweet yogurt pilgrims who had come before me, making today's treat possible.<//review><rating>5<//rating>< userid>

3 1/2 hour unload.   Not the best time but customer service was great from all.  I can see how it can be longer but after seeing some reviews of 11 hours or more to unload I was very happy to get out sooner. They do allow you to go out and get food if needed with no issues.  You check in with your "Txxxxxxxxxx" number at gate then park your trailer go to the office tell them if you have any load locks or straps they will make a note and they do the rest.  Just sit back patiently and wait for the call.< /review>

14 hours to unload 11 pallets...  all i can say that's a record for the inefficient hall of shame.  Or maybe they just ran out of crayons.  Either way,  it'll be a impressive facility once they find someone to work there.   Big zero stars there off target<//text>

MANAGEMENT. Could you please explain your yard drivers. If they dropped refer with temperature sensitive load inside, they MUST closed trailer doors.

I had two stops. First in Target, then one more. Target driver just dropped refer and was so lazy to close refer doors. At least one hour refer was on parking lot with opened doors.<//text>

this target distribution center in shafter CA (zachary)
for all truckers ,  stay away from this place , there’s many issues with this location , when your trying to deliver a load .
fist of all , if your delivering a load , plan on being there anywhere from 6 to 10 hours of waiting for them to unload your truck ,
last time , I took a load there , the office lost my BOL papers , and they just saying that they couldn’t find them , as if it wasn’t a big deal ,
as a driver , i have to have the BOL singed  by them proving that they received the load .
and they had the nerve to just tell me , basically that it was too bad but they couldn’t find my papers ..
this is not acceptable and or professional.

also this last friday , i took another load to this place , and in the trailer i also had one pallet from the previous load that i delivered earlier , this pallet i put it at the very end of the trailer so that it doesn’t get on their way when the target guys unload their pallets ,
well after waiting about 10 hours for the whole unloading process, they told me they finally had my trailer unloaded and ready for me .
and after hooking to my trailer , i found out that ,
the one pallet of product I had , was gone , and that pallet of product wasn’t for Target and they could clearly see it , because it was a pallet of (Tostadas) a mexican food product .
well the whole pallet was gone .
I went to the office and complained about them taking my pallet and everybody there said they didn’t know what i was talking about , that they didn’t see any pallets being taken out by the unloading guys .
they said they asked the workers and that nobody saw anything ,  so after that they just ignored me .

i already knew that this Target distribution center had a horrible service and working personal ,
but i didn’t know they were going as far as to steal property from the drivers ..
all those workers from there , are nothing but thieves . and they will steal your stuff too , if you are not extremely careful .
TO ALL DRIVERS , IF YOU CAN AVOID GOING TO THIS PLACE ALL TOGETHER, PLEASE DO SO .
unless you want to learn the hard way ..</text>

<text>Dont come here. They take up to 16 hours to unload a live load. Make sure your broker pays hourly detention, flat rate detention is not worth it here because they will easily waste your whole day. And dont pick up from dsc San Bernardino for this facility, you will regret it. Everything else was ok except the unloading time. No overnight parking and only 30 mins on facility after they unloaded you.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>my appointment was 10am and after 2 hours i went inside and they told me they were on break from 10am to 10:45am. why make the appointment if you will be on break. took 5 hours to get unloaded and then they took another hour to give me my trailer because they were on break. there was another 3 drivers who were waiting since the morning 6am and i left them waiting. their average unload time is 8 to 9 hours. Avoid this warehouse at any cost.</review>< pics>

Worst place to deliver to; trailer in a door for over 6 hours now and when I asked I was told detention doesn’t apply to them. Stay clear of delivering to this location if you want to keep your trucking business afloat<//review>

First time delivering there, hope it's the last! 16 hours from the time I showed up. 1:45 before my appointment at 1630.  You have to drop trailer and stay in bobtail area, Not knowing when your trailer is being unloaded, waiting on phone call to inform you that you are empty and paperwork is ready. If you miss their phone call, because you fell asleep, after so many hours of waiting, they don't call you back, they don't come out yo find you, they just make snide remarks about why you weren't monitoring your phone. Thier lack of hurry, made me loose my next load. I lost more driving time thanks to their selfish, unprofessional ways. They could learn from Wal-Mart and Costco how to run a distribution center efficiently and how to value truck drivers time.</review>

Setting up apts here absolutely sucks. They make the carrier do all their work by entering each PO individually which takes forever. They also do not answer the phone. Then after my driver is on time they take 8 hours to unload. This place always takes forever.<//review>

Truckers: The reason why they take nearly 10-12 hours to unload a truck is because they literally have one person unloading everything.

Future applicants: Prepare yourselves for long massive shift hours, soreness and strains, pressure and stress from  high expectations and standards. And if you are in a temp agency, it’s a lot harder to stay permanent because they’re looking for a good reason to terminate you, whether you aren’t meeting the requirements or whatever the situation or case may be. Being hired directly through target doesn’t guarantee you a stable job, whether you do a no call / no show or call in ahead of time, they’ll immediately get rid of you.  They don’t directly mention their 90 days of probation properly. Lack of management and leadership.

I recently got “injured” from improper movements and had a back strain for weeks. Nevertheless, the OM blamed “incident outside of work” and how could it possibly happen at work if “safety” always goes first. That’s where they are wrong, they don’t care about your health unless you’ve injured yourself badly. Medcor: Apply biofreeze and try to get someone to massage you... Oh, and to mention the OPERATING MANAGER was complaining about being “mentally stressed” because he had to show up to work at 3am, which was 3 hours before the 6am shift... and that he couldn’t do anything to help me out because he’s not a “doctor”... literally the worst person to speak to about an incident or injury.
As a result, they terminated me because of my “own injury” and I wasn’t fully preforming well or meeting the expectations, due to the back pain making me move at a slow pace. And lastly, I had called in a few hours late because of a serious family emergency and they didn’t seem to care or handle the situation properly; instead, the OM wrote me up as a “no show / no call policy” which completely gave me a major strike of termination....

The cycle goes on for days...new inexperienced people go in then back out. You’ll either quit, be terminated, or end up staying. Very few employees end up staying...

If you are looking for warehouse work, try somewhere else and truckers stay away from this location!</text>

I worked there for about three months and it the conditions you work in are horrible. I worked night shift and they would dust everything while we were still in there, I'd go home and when id blow my nose its just be a bunch of black stuff. They do provided us gloves but the biggest problem has to be the air quality it's very bad in there it's basically like smoking. Only reason I didnt give it a one star is because the break room was nice and had good options.<//text>

The most inefficient warehouse I've ever had the displeasure of visiting.  Not to mention the bathroom being filthy.  This is absolutely unacceptable and I won't return.

*update*  After going to the office and inquiring about what was taking so long, I was told that I could've been helping the whole time!  The staff was polite, but I wish I'd have known that from the beginning. That would've cut my wait time down drastically!  When I went in and saw how much work one person was doing, it all made sense.  That was way too much work for one person to do in a timely manner, and next time I'll be helping from the start.</text>

<Text>I work there, the supervisor always acts like she's all about safety. But she assigns us so many lanes (trucks), it is impossible to do catch up with loading that much boxes, and still follow safety practices. You are forced to skip safety and take shortcut. I've witnessed that nobody follows all the safety practices. But thats the only way to get it done on time. However, I don't like to get hurt, so I work how I got trained to do so, taking no short cuts, and the supervisor comes and tells me that I'm being slow, and I need to have a sense of urgency. Really??!!!! I'm literally exhausted because I've been working hard and trying to as fast as I can, and she assumes im not trying and that it's easy. She's never done this labor before. She should honestly do it one day, so she can see how it's impossible to do that much work and yet safety. The only way to get it done, is you have to twisted your body a lot, and throw boxes, which messes up your back and your arms.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

Target cares about drivers as much as Wal-Mart does. NOT at all! I've been sitting here over 5 hours for them to give me paperwork back. Unacceptable and shows gross negligence to our 14 hour clock. Won't be back.</Review>

(Translated by Google) It's awful to come to this place, I'm here since 8 AM it's 6:15 pm
10 hours standing here, it's a real headache to deal with these people, they eat your unimportant time, 😡😡😡

<Review>First time here and I tried the garlic bread appetizer and the baked Mac n Cheese for my meal. The garlic bread was a bit charred/crisp around the edges but that was just the type of bread, still great flavor. The olive oil was definitely high quality and the added season was a nice touch. The Mac n cheese was creamy which I like, but I wasn’t a fan of the flavor. I could tell it was a quality made dish, just not for me. The staff was super friendly and I will definitely be back to try the pizza. Total for the two dishes pre-tax was $19.50<//Review><Date>1524800517543</Date><user>110848546821851019408< /user>< Resp>

Good food but they recently changed owners and got rid of my favorite dish.
They are under staffed so expect slower service.  But otherwise a great place to go.</review>

My partner and I have been going to this place for years and it has never disappointed us. The ambiance is classy and cozy. The food is good and the service is friendly. They also  have a nice selection of beer and wine. It's a perfect place for a casual date night or a family spot. It's truly a hidden neighborhood gem.< /Text>

Pizza Moda is one of my favorite pizza places in the Bay Area, hands down. The staff is equal parts friendly and professional, and the pizza is mouthwatering and creative, with rotating specialities depending on the season (can't wait for the corn pizza to return in the summer!). Considering deals like Wine Wednesdays (any bottle of wine for $15), you'd also be hard-pressed to find a better deal. I really can't recommend Pizza Moda enough.< /review>

Great food with reasonable prices and wonderful service. The decor in the restaurant also definitely helps create an ambient mood. They serve pastas, pizzas and some appetizers. I definitely recommend trying the balsamic crisp, it's like a pie in a cup served with organic ice cream and it is worth the wait. Check this place out if you're looking for a place for date night.<//Review>

Pizza moda has some good Pizza, however since the owner changed it hasn't been the same (still not bad). It is up class but  still worth the cost either way.< /Review>

<Text>I really REALLY like their zucchini salad! I don't know what it is, but I was left craving it after the first time I visited the restaurant that I ended up going back a few weeks later to get it again. The pizzas were also good and well flavored. I would prefer the pasta orders to be a bit larger, but flavor-wise, was also yum.</Text>< pictures>

Can't speak too highly.

Quality and freshness of food...suspect

Hygiene....is lacking

Service....poor

It's Berkeley. Throw a rock and it will land on decent to great pizza of all shapes and types.

I won't be back.<//text>

Pizza Moda is great. I have a lot of food sensitivities, but ordering was no-hassle, and my food came out exactly as I'd ordered it. The waiter even suggested some good substitutions I didn't even think of.

They make house made vegan sausage, and you can do either Daiya or cashew cream as a vegan cheese. I asked for cashew cream on my pasta, which was delicious.

4 stars because we came in a large group and the service was slow (only one waiter for 25 people), but he was a nice guy, in any event.</Review>

Shanty operation.

The place looks nice. I only had a pizza to go, which was quite greasy and not really tasty. It's probably an ok "American" pizza, whatever that means, I wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for an Italian pizza< /Review>

<Time>1522831543883<//Time><text>The kitchen is unclean as is the establishment. Seriously saw some disgusting lack of cleanliness. Pizza is ewual to Dominos. Better off going most other spots in Berkeley. If you want thin crust, Zacharys has a thin option, in addn to deep dish and many others.

What a joke.

I've heard Jeff the owner describe the restaurant as his "art project" and he treats it as such. The level of detail in the pizza moda experience truly elevates this from your normal pizza joint. Well thought out decór, a casual yet classy ambiance, carefully hidden accoustic treatment so even though the restaurant is lined with windows it doesn't get too loud unlike so many other places in town, attentive yet unrushed staff, a well thought out beverage selection (arrogant bastard on tap!), and of course Jeff tying it all together with his personnal touch. Our favorites from the regularly changing menu have been house smoked salmon pizza with pesto & caviar creme fraiche, fritto misto, and all the pastas have been to die for. Killer espresso, too!</review>

They should be shut down. They lie about being organic & pasture raised and have for years. Their "vegan" items are prepped on the same cutting boards with the same knives and utensils they use for meat. Shame!<//Review>

<review>The best service I've ever experienced with a body shop. First I called my insurance to report the accident sitting in my car in my driveway. Hung up from them walked 30 steps in my house & before I can close my door to lock it, once inside. This auto repair shop was calling me back, like wow. Excellent customer service from the phone to the body shop. To fast service in a matter of days. My car accident was minor of course. The look of the repairs was SUPERB! I'm definitely telling everyone you won't be disappointed!</review><resp>None<//resp><rate>5</rate><user_name>Felicia G.<//user_name>< gmap_id>

<rate>5<//rate><review>My truck was so smashed in the front and I was so upset. I took my truck to them at the suggestion of my insurance company. I am sooooo glad I did. The job they did was incredible. I couldn't believe that I was looking at the same truck. My truck literally looked like it had just rolled off the assembly line. I am beyond thrilled. I can't say enough about this company. If my truck ever needs anything else done to it, whether voluntary or not, I will ONLY take it to them. Highly recommend and would not hesitate to refer family and friends. Thank you so much Cerritos Autobody.<//review>< pictures>

I would highly recommend Cerritos Auto Body to anyone who needs work done on their car.  The customer service was top notch and the desk was quick to contact me after I filed my claim.  My car came out cleaner than when I brought it in with the sanitization process and the work was done within 2 days of filing my claim.  It was much faster than I expected.  Extremely professional and friendly.  I will be back if I ever need work done on my car again.< /review>

<Review>I'm extremely happy with the service I received.  Not only were the staff, professional, friendly and efficient... They went above and beyond to buff out some minor scratches that wasn't part of the scope of work that they were contracted for.  They also completed work early and got me back in my car sooner than I would have ever imagined!</Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Marco and the rest of the Cerritos Auto Body were all very nice from answering all my questions to taking me home after I dropped off my car to waiting for me to pick up my car after they’ve finished fixing it. It was a great experience trusting them with my car!</review>< Pics>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>I will be posting about this using two different experiences.

I have visited this place about 9 months ago. My insurance (Progressive) set up an appointment here to take my car. When I walked in they were friendly and caring and asked if I was doing okay from the accident.
They also work with Enterprise so someone from Enterprise was able to pick me up and take me back to the office to pick up my rental car.

The work to the vehicle was beautifully done. I definitely recommend coming here. So much so, this Monday I was rear ended and will be bringing my car back here to be worked on.

So far the other parties insurance sucks, (Infinity Auto Insurance) The insurance basically told me to take it wherever I wanted and they issued me a check to cover the costs of it (Though the body shop has not evaluated it) I called Cerritos Auto Body and made an appointment to bring in my car, and even setting up the reservation for my car rental. To me, this is going above and beyond since it has nothing to do with them. I appreciate this gesture.

***Will update with more once my experience is complete.<//Review>< gmap_id>

This is the second vehicle I've taken to Cerritos Auto Boby. Last time they gave me my car the same way I bought it. So I will let them do it again. And yes it a different car. ✌</text>

This place is awesome. Tina was awesome. I got a loaner car from them which was a great help. I got texts giving me updates on my car often. Car was returned smelling and looking new. Thanks Cerritos. I can be a pain in the butt sometimes with my calls and requests but they handled it like champs. Very professional 👍👍<//Text>

I don't know how they got it to look so shiny and new.  They even buffed out her taillights and headlights from the oxidation that happens on cars over time!  Those were not even near the damaged area so they did not have to do it.  Very nice people, will def come back if I ever need repairs again.<//Review>< time>

Great service, and great workmanship. Had the misfortune of someone rear ending my vehicle over 10 years ago, dealer recommended this place. Haven't been anywhere else since. In L.A. traffic most of us have felt the pain of an accident, these guys definitely help ease the pain.< /Review>

Didn't fix accident repair right and transmission quit in less than a month and even tho 2 different mechanics told progressive insurance that the cause was due to the previous accident and wasn't fixed right they denied amending the claim to repair. DONT TAKE VEHICLE HERE. They will screw you< /text>

<Text>I went up to the shop for an estimate for a minor job, < $3K total. Marcos provided an estimate via email later that day. I later decided to adjust that I wanted to adjust the estimate to exclude some items and reached out to Marcos via email. He did not respond for a week. After 2 weeks with no response, I decided to call the shop and was told by the person answering the phone that he (Marcos) was "swamped" but would reach out to me within 24 hours. It has been a week and still no response. I have been a Progressive customer for over 10 years and they recommended this shop to me. Sticking with the facts, they were unresponsive for a small job as a result I would not select them for a larger, more complex job. I would suggest Penske Collision Center in Downey as an alternative. Even though it was a small job, they provided the same level of service as if it were a larger job.<//Text>< Pictures>

From our initial consult with Kevin through to installation by Matt & Eugene, we were very impressed with their collective knowledge, professionalism, and workmanship. They simply out-hustled the competition by listening to what was important to us, proposing a system that met our needs, being willing to do the extra work, and delivering a quality product.< /review>

<Text>The previous tech from Environmental accidentally blew the inverter inside the new compressor and Kevin was sent to replace the inverter.  Kevin was very knowledgeable about Lennox equipment.  Not only did he isolate the problem to the inverter only, he made a trip to Home Depot to get a replacement for the breaker that had also blown.  I appreciated his can-do attitude and his determination to resolve the problem for me today.   This speaks highly of Kevin’s professionalism and reflects well on Environmental.<//Text><Resp>{'time': 1623097464442, 'text': 'Thank you for sharing your feedback and fro instilling your trust in our team.

Eddie and his crew were excellent - they worked really well together as a team. They completed the replacement of our AC unit and relocation of our heater to the attic in 2 days. They were very respectful and friendly and we enjoyed listening to their friendly banter and laughter throughout the day. They were really good about letting us know what work was being done, answered our questions and cleaned up after the end of each day. They were a pleasure to have at our home and we were almost sorry to see them complete the job and leave. Nothing but best wishes to all of them. Thank you for a great experience.</Review>

I was really impressed with the whole team that came to my house and installed a new furnace, new ducts, and a new air conditioner.  Everybody knew exactly what they were doing and worked politely and efficiently.  Blake courageously lived in my crawl space for 3 days, connecting new ducts.  Eugene installed a nice flat pad for the air conditioner in the side yard.  Zavier handled all the electronics of the new furnace.  Nick finished off the closet to perfection.  Eddie (team leader) was delightful.  You could tell the whole team enjoyed being with each other which was nice to hear in the house after a year of pandemic silence.  They all wore masks the whole time and shoe coverings.  Overall, the experience was completely pleasant.  Excellent communication.  Finished work.  Kept house clean.  Good value too!<//Text>

We recently had this amazing company clean, seal, and put in new duct work to our attic, and insulation. I absolutely love the team especially, Kris, and Gabriel who came to the house multiple days. They were so kind, hard working, and courteous. They went above and beyond, explained things to me when I had questions, were on time, called as they were on their way, and I had the utmost faith in them and their work.

Gabriel noticed there was a board in the attic that was cracked. They came back and stabilized the broken board in the attic. Not only did they do that but they also puttied our ceiling, sanded, matches our paint, and repainted our ceiling. This kind of service it's not something I'm used to. They went above and beyond what they had to do. It was a great experience< /Review>

Hans stopped by to look at the current HVAC system and evaluate the potential for an upcoming addition to my home. We went up in the attic, changed the filter, and diagnosed a potential leaking problem.

Excellent suggestions, very congenial, knowledgeable, and professional. The office had given me the potential appointment arrival time as between noon and four. He was there at noon! When does that ever happen? I’m awaiting his proposal, but pretty sure it will be a winner.
Thank you!</text>

We are absolutely pleased with the work completed by Environmental Heating and Air Solutions. The initial visit to discuss our needs went just like they said it would—we had a lengthy conversation about what we could get from a new HVAC system, and Chris prepared a very competitively-priced estimate on the spot.

The installation crew showed up when they said they would, everyone operated at a professional caliber and they handled the job expertly even with a minor surprise water leak. We appreciate that they just handled some of the smaller details that came up during a new system installation (moving a light in the furnace closet, routing new drain and coolant lines and a water line leak).

Props to the whole crew for a very successful job. Thanks for the great work—Chris, Zach, Kevin, Nick and Matt.<//Text>

< review>
I had 4 different HVAC companies quote us on a complete system replacement, one was even a little less then Environmental, but none compared to the professionalism, expertise and knowledge of this company...  The two young men that came to install our system were very polite and respective while performing the installation.  They were also Very professional and knowledgeable about the systems they were installing, and taking time to answer every question we had as the installation proceeded.  I am very conscious of how well someone performs their jobs and I must say, these two installers were meticulous with respect to the job they performed... At completion, they spent all the time we requested to go over our new system and were very patient in answering all our questions... They did an exemplary job with the install and then did an great job of the clean-up process... I would highly recommend this company for any and all of your HVAC needs.  John in Roseville< /review>

The whole experience was very smooth. Tom was great from the get go for helping with every question my wife and I had (even on Saturday nights)!

The installation crew answered any remaining questions we had prior, during and after installation.

The crew was very professional and you can tell they all took a lot of pride in their work, which we are very grateful for.

We felt very comfortable with the company as a whole and will be using / recommending them to anyone who asked about heating and air related work.

A big THANK YOU to the whole team from front desk to sales and installation crew!<//Text>< username>

Alonzo does amazing service, he has been our maintain effective  guy the majority of the services done. Accept for the new heating system a few years back. Very courteous, wears shoes coves,, gives detail info on all maintain done. Cleans up after each job, Before he leaves he goes over his work in detail to make sure we understand. He is very though in making recommendations for what needs to be done to keep the equipment in top condition. We are very grateful for his very warm personality. Knows his work and very detailed in explanation of what he has done. We are grateful for Environmental Heating and air. The death of my grandson has kinda thrown me off a bit but we are working on getting everything updated. Again, thank you so much.< /Review>

Carey was very professional and informative on how to use the system for both heat and AC for all the zones that are installed in the home. We look forward to seeing him as we go thru the years and having maintenance completed to make sure everything is running in excellent condition.</review><GmapID>0x809b219ca5624b01:0xfed24a875d8e8051< /GmapID>< userid>

<Review>I had the opportunity to speak with Michael Goater regarding my furnace not working properly. He answered all my questions with confidence and put my mind at ease. This company goes above and beyond to provide an amazing customer experience. I'm looking forward to using their services in the future, and highly recommend Environmental Heating and Air Solutions to anyone needing heating and air services.< /Review>< gmap_id>

He came out for an AC replacement estimate but also gave an estimate to replace a bad fan motor. I told him another company came out and determined it was a bad fan motor. Hans said he can repair it now which I was surprised since the other company had a hard time locating a fan motor. Furthermore, he double checked that it was the fan and pointed out a few things that was done wrong in the last repair. I went with the fan replacement. The unit now starts quickly and runs quietly due to the state-of-the-art motor he installed. All done in 1 hour at an agreeable price. I’m glad they came out because I was not yet ready to get a new AC and I have high confidence in a job done right by a reputable company.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Carey was a really great guy and came in with a mask on which we appreciated. We have a 24 year old HVAC and AC unit which is struggling every day. Carey didn’t try to sell us on anything but went over the issues he found. We decided to schedule a follow up to see what are options are with replacing the units rather than fixing individual issues with the current unit.
Everyone that has come out from this company has been very nice and respectful. We hope to see some good numbers when they come back out next week.<//Text>< pictures>

From scheduling an appointment and all the way through the repair, Environmental was quick to respond, courteous, and informative!  My technician was Carey Sommer. He replaced a capacitor for my AC and was happy to walk me through each step. Carey showed an attention to detail that was encouraging, fixing a loose hinge and adding sealant to a leaky valve cap. I'd happily give this company my business again and have signed up for their twice a year maintenance plan. I feel confident that I'll not be stuck at home in 110° weather without AC again!< /text>

If he is representative of the entire company,  I could not have been happier. I explained verbally and had taken numerous pictures of our furnaces to show us exactly what he had done and what needed to be repaired, if necessary. I highly recommend Environmental Heating and Air because of the work he preformed.</Text>< pics>

<Review>On one of the hottest summer days we realized our AC had stopped working. After a few recommendations Hans was referred to us. He arrived at our house within 30 mins (on a holiday) and quickly fixed our AC unit. He was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. He set us up with a maintenance plan that will hopefully allow us to avoid any issues in the future. I definitely recommend Environmental Heating and Air for any of your AC needs!< /Review>< Pics>

Our AC went out on a 100 degree day and I was able to get Carey at Environmental H&A to come out that evening at 7:30 to fix the issue. Carey was awesome, very knowledgeable, and took the time to explain what he was doing and why. I liked the personal touch and his willingness to get the job done the right way. Definitely a solid company.</Text>

Carey was fantastic. He was professional, intelligent, explained everything he found and even took pictures so I didn’t have to crawl in the attic, and on top of all of that he was personable. Two thumbs up!!! Would for sure recommend to friends and family.<//text>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>Don't waste your time. Find a more reliable contractor.

I inquired through Costco and was connected to this company.  They don't often answer their phones so it's tough to get ahold of anyone, but I was able to schedule an appointment for 2 weeks out.  They called just before the appointment to cancel it because they're too busy with service calls. Too late because I already took off work to be home for the appointment.  They asked me to call to reschedule, so I did.  It took 3 phone calls to get someone from the company, not the answering service they use, on the phone to reschedule.  I scheduled an appointment for 8-9am the following week. See the attached email confirmation.

Fast forward.  They called and text the day before to tell me that I had a 9am appointment--not 8-9am like originally scheduled--a hard, 9am appointment. That's much better than an arrrival window.  I questioned it to confirm and they assured me that someone would arrive at 9am.  So, I take off work and wait at home.  At 9:10am, no one arrived or called.  I text to get a status.  No reply.  At 9:20am, I called and their phones went straight to voicemail.  I left a message and text again.

They called back around 9:30am to inform me their design person was 45 minutes away.  An hour and fifteen minutes late!?!? And I had to call to find out.  This means he didn't even leave the shop until well after he was supposed to be at my house.  I took off work to be home for both appointments which makes this incredibly frustrating for me.

How can you trust a company if they can't even be on-time for a sales appointment or have the courtesy to call in advance if they're running late?< /review>< pics>

<Review>Zavier & Eddie of Environmental Heating & Air Solutions did an amazing job installing a new air conditioner and furnace. I have done research with multiple vendors for months and glad I made the decision to purchase a new air conditioning system. The technicians were professional, friendly and  included a courtesy call prior to the arrival on the day of the installation. Once the technicians arrived, they worked non stop until the task was accomplished and did a walk through on the new equipment. Overall , I am pleased with their ability to adhere to the schedule without any surprises on such a big purchase item for my home.

Keep up the great work and professionalism.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1597082084662, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback on your new comfort system installed in your home.

This is the first time I have dealt with this company. Started out with Ms Shauntic on the phone and she was able to fit me in the same day. I met up with Hans in Antioch and he took care of my AC . He was very thorough on what he found on my aging AC. I was confidant in him and he explained everything in detail. I was very satisfied with the outcome. I phoned the office for their follow up and spoke with Chrissy. Both office personnel were awesome. I had to come from Hayward and the office made it work for me. I salute them.
Thank you so much. My tenants couldn’t believe how quick this was taken care of. God bless us.< /text>

You company was awesome, came out next day. when our AC went out unexpectedly on a  100 plus degree day.  The technician Nowel was right on time, and did a fantastic job quickly diagnosing the issue and repairing on the spot.  He went the extra mile ensuring we had the proper parts installed and even verified the temperature of our vents.. He was helpful, courteous, and a professional.  Overall I feel not only were the repairs handled in a quality matter but also the price was fair.  We will definitely call you company again for our AC needs!</Review>

Lorenzo, the technician that came to do the semiannual service check and maintenance on our home air conditioning and heating system, arrived on time, and was very professional and courteous.  He was prompt, worked efficiently, and ensured he checked everything properly.  He took photos, which facilitated the explanation of what he did.  After Lorenzo was done with his work, he described what steps he took, and answered all the questions we had, clearly and satisfactorily.  We were very happy and satisfied with all aspects of his visit and work.</Review>

<Review>Carey was my technician. Fantastic young man. Very professional, easy going, well mannered. Answered all my questions and provided descriptions of procedures. It’s becoming less common to find service technicians and representatives of this caliber, so it’s easy for me to say that this company set themselves up for success with this hire.<//Review><Rating>5<//Rating></record>

< Review>
At our home, we rarely used the heater or air conditioning during the year. We had a system that always had issues. My mom decided to purchase a new unit because summer season feels like it gets hotter and unbearable. Today, Ben Carter came by to check on our furnace and air conditioner units for a maintenance check. He was able to explain how things worked with our units and how to properly maintain them to make sure they continue to work properly. He also made suggestions due to fire season and blackouts, and explained the importance of the suggestions. Both him and the company are professional, knowledgeable and very helpful. Thank you so much.< /Review>

My experience with environmental started with the very first phone call I made to them. Gina answer the phone with professional greeting and a lovely attitude. I have to say I called several other companies prior to that but her voice and her vibe on the phone was the reason I chose this service.
It was followed up by a visit from Hans,  Who delivered a diagnostic to me regarding my furnace . He was professional, gracious and very ,very personable. On top of that he was knowledgeable and explained my options.
I was happy to have a follow up appointment a few days later where he replaced a part that was faulty . Restoring  my home with the warmth that it needed.
I invested in their maintenance plan because I look forward to seeing Hans again twice a year for tune ups.
I cannot say enough about this company, and it’s employees .... the service and conduct are amazing !!
I look forward to having a lasting relationship with this company and the employees it keeps...
Not only for my heater needs but that of my water heater and A/C unit. I know all will be safe in their keep!
Very highly recommend, trust me you’ll enjoy this interaction. Thank you employees of environmental! Look forward to see you in spring when I have the tuneup on my heater done. In fact you guys are so friendly can I just call and talk? Anyway I highly recommend !! I know you will enjoy your experience with them as I have. Sincerely, Kimberly<//review>

When Carey arrived from Environmental Heating & Air Solutions he quickly assessed and diagnosed the problem accurately and was able to repair the situation with common sense, logic, and skill. As an added bonus he was pleasant as well as professional. (One of the previous hvac techs had preached religion and politics, another had belabored about breaking up with a cheating fiancé the morning he came over. NOT cool)

I highly recommend Environmental Heating & Air. And be sure to ask for Carey!<//text>< UserId.>

<response>{'time': 1603409836068, 'text': "Mr. Thomas we will go ahead and do this again here, just as we did earlier. Rheem requires their warranty to be approved and authorized bye them, not a contractor.\nLet's tell the whole story.\nThe system was purchased 6 years prior to us ever coming out by another contractor who installed the system poorly, therefore they are out of business when we came out to your home at the end of 2019 (a year ago).\nYou heat exchanger was cracked due to the unit not moving enough air across it when heating. We took pictures and video, we shared the information with you, we contacted the manufacture on your behalf and we provided you options and pricing in November 2019. You and I spoke multiple times, I explained everything to you on each occasion, I clearly stated that if you were not comfortable with any of this that you could work with Rheem directly or call out another company to explore the options that they might have. Even up to the day the repairs were actually performed (Dec. 2019) I called you and verified that you wished to move forward and that if you were not comfortable, to not have the work done.\nYou had our technician out, you signed off on all the work and then you paid for all the work. There was never a point in time that you were not in full control of this situation and the fact that you keep saying that because you have a warranty, it should have cost you nothing and that Rheem should pay the bill is simply not the way manufacture warranties work. We tried to get Rheem to play the bill, they declined.\nSo as a small business it is not fair nor is it reasonable to believe that a system we had absolutely nothing to do with for over half of a decade, we should just do everything for free and take in on the chin.\nLast year we went back and forth on these review sites and now we are doing it again a year later. At least this year we know that you are safe and no longer have cracks in your heat exchanger as we approach the cooler weather. I truly hope that at some point you will understand and recognize that all we did was inform you of a very unsafe situation and do everything we could within our power to correct that situation for you.\nWe wish you the very best"}< /response><GmapID>0x809b219ca5624b01:0xfed24a875d8e8051< /GmapID>< date>

< Review>
When I called to set up an appointment the lady was RUDE and impatient for absolutely no reason. So rude I couldn’t handle it and hung up on her. Decided to go somewhere else the next day got a voicemail saying they would be at our house in 30 minutes. The ONLY reason we used their service is because they were there and it was 102 outside and we didn’t want our toddler to suffer in the heat. I was told on the phone that it doesn’t go by who made the appointment first it goes by who needs help more than others first. That’s not okay! That’s BS. Other than that he fixed the problem quick which was great. Over all won’t be calling you guys again.<//Review>

<review>There are 4 reasons why this employee and the company the best. First off punctuality. Casey, who's the most professional and stellar person I've had the pleasure of encountering, was not only exactly on time like he said he would be but he was more than willing to work with us on the time that he arrived. This was extremely helpful because of my work schedule. You only get one chance to make a first impression and ,let me tell you ,impressions like punctuality and willingness to work with customers shows a level of professionalism and quality that goes way above and beyond any other traditional company. Secondly, knowledge. Casey's knowledge is extensive when it comes to HVAC systems. Not only is knowledge important for repairs and diagnoses but how it's applied, or more importantly, how Casey applied it. Our breaker was the reason our AC wasn't working. He could have flipped it and gone on about his day. Instead of just replacing a part or doing a quick repair he actually thought to figure out WHY it tripped in the first place. Anyone can replace a part but it takes a very intelligent and true professional individual to figure out why it broke/tripped in the first place so future repairs won't be needed. It turns out there was an internal switch that wasn't functioning properly and would continue tripping the braker and burn out the compressor had he not thought to investigate further. This, again, speaks volumes about Casey as not only a person but as an employee and therefore about the company. Third, honesty. He was immediately upfront and forthcoming about pricing and diagnostic fees and didn't want anyone to be blindsided by price and wanted to ensure we started on the right page. He took the time to sit down and discuss in full detail what was going on, how it needs to be fixed, what the process and prices are. He was also extremely polite on the phone, very personable, and was even nice enough to let me watch him on the job so he could explain what was going on and how it was causing a problem. Lastly, the most important part of the experience is how fast the company was able to schedule someone. My wife is currently 28 days away from having our first child. Calling at almost midnight to set something up during busy season is one thing but having someone come, diagnose and then make repairs the next day is literally the best thing ever. The idea that their call center is 24/7 is GENIUS. Please choose Casey for your repairs if you can. The employees that this company chooses, makes this company the best hands down. It reflects on the morals and quality of the company. A+ job.<//review><name>Sebastian Sutton< /name><Rating>5</Rating></record>

We've used Environmental Heating and Air for the past 10 years. I wrote a Yelp review at my first interaction which was very positive and let us to contract for their services on a semi-annual basis. We haven't missed an appointment and have been pleased with the service ever since. They are ALWAYS responsive, prompt, communicate well and address any problems with pragmatic options. There are many companies who are happy to get our business but we will stay with one that has, over the years and through experience, proven themselves over and over again.< /Text>

Environmental called ahead to see if they could come early and it resulted in  perfect outcome.  In and Out.  Technician covered all the key points and made sure I was aware of all my options.  There was full transparency.  The monthly service plan includes both an AC & Heating check-up.  Great Value!!</text>

We’ve had the maintenance plan for a year now. We had to find a new service provider and we have been happy with the service so far. We had technicians come in the summer and winter to do regular maintenance. I appreciated the thorough assessment of our system and their recommendations. We signed up for another year and we are confident to continue to have constantly working heating and air conditioning.<//review>

Hans was an exceptional technician that possesses more superior knowledge and experience than the rest of the HVAC techs who came by to try to diagnose and fix my heater blower motor. He assessed, diagnosed and remedied the issue as quickly as possible, all while maintaining great conversation and a relaxed atmosphere. He was respectful and nice to my very curious 4 year old without getting frustrated at all his questions and lack of personal bubble.

I would strongly recommend his company and specifically Hans as a technician.< /text>

<Review>Walking down the hall one evening on a hot summer Sunday night, we noticed that we had the beginning of an indoor waterfall. This is NEVER a good thing unless you live in the Amazon and it is part of your house design. We don't. Not even close. Husband goes into the attic and the overflow pan underneath the a/c unit is filled with water. Keep in mind, it's like 90 degrees outside and 120+ in the attic. Tried getting the water with towels, but quickly realized we needed the wet/dry vac. Three trips down the ladder later, the pan was dry again, but in order to alleviate any problems during the night we turned the A/C off and slept with our windows open and fans going. During this time, I had also made several calls to local places to see if anyone was available, but on a Sunday night ... no one was. Imagine that. Then I started doing what I do - due diligence and looking at reviews looking at costs and general overall reviews. I came across Environmental Heating & Air Solutions and their reviews were positive so I left a message. Monday morning, we received a phone call and they had availability that afternoon. Hans was the technician they sent and he was amazing. He took the time to diagnose what was going on and gave us the news of what needed to be repaired, including what could and couldn't wait according to his expertise. He helped us break it down and choose what was imperative for maintaining it for at least a few more years. Some of the parts had to be ordered, so we did have to wait another week for them, but were installed without too much of a delay. We though we were done for awhile until the outside fan starting making a horrible grinding noise, so we called again hoping that it was a part that was under warranty. Nope - it's the compressor. We have been hit with a lot of bills lately due to an emergency surgery that our daughter needed, so money is extremely tight for us. Thankfully, Hans was able to help and gave us a reduced price on the part. We have a firm commitment to supporting the local businesses rather than the chains, which is part of why we initially chose Environmental Heating & Air Solutions, but now we view them differently and would highly recommend them as a company that cares about their customers. If you are in need of AC repairs, Environmental Heating & Air Solutions is the place to go and Hans is the technician you want to have. He not only takes pride in his work, but genuinely cares about his customers.</Review>< Pics>

<text>After our AC went down for the 2nd time, we called Environmental Heating and air to help us.  Carey Sommers responded to our call and diagnosed that we had a bad fan motor on our outside unit.  Carey attempted to order the part from Lenox distributor but ran a cross the problem of not having the part and was on back order and could not give a time when it would be available and Lenox did not provide any assistance.  Carey Sommers and Michael did their research and came up with a solution for replacing the unit.  I want to give both Carey Sommers and Michael a grade of A++++ for repairing our AC with great response and professional work, I would recommend them for AC repair.< /text><Gmap_id>0x809b219ca5624b01:0xfed24a875d8e8051</Gmap_id><Pics>None</Pics></record>

(This should actually be a requirement of all internet review platform sites to protect companies. It takes so much work to build a brand and reputation, yet only a few seconds for anyone in the world to discredit all that you\'ve worked for with a couple of key strokes.)\n\nThe challenge with internet reviews is anyone can go to any company and write anything they wish, without any verification requirements. This is unfair in this day and age of "Keyboard Courage"\nWhat defense does an organization have?\n\nHere is what I do know to be factual and true; There is not one team member here at EHA that is not committed to delivering a 5 star customer experience, which is clearly shown in the amount of 5 Stars reviews right here on Google as well as several other platforms.\n\nIf you were unhappy with our services from last year, why not call us? Why not allow us to look up your customer information and determine what we did and how we could have made it right. Every call comes into our office and is answered and dispatched from there, so I\'m not sure how you contacted "the rep who originally helped you"? What number did you call to contact this person?\n\nWe have so few 1 star reviews that if you scrolled down far enough and read them, you would know when we are at fault, we own it.\n\nWe know that we are not perfect. All we can do is give our best each and every day and make it our mission to serve at the highest level.\n\nIf you want us as well as the internet community reading this far into this review to accept your feedback as an accurate representation of our services, then help us identify you in our database.\n\nYou can call any of us (Matthew, Michael and Jillian) directly at the office Monday through Friday and help us identify this situation so that we can learn from it and determine exactly what could have been done to enhance our quality of service.\n\nIf you would prefer not to call, just respond to this message with the name on your account or the phone number you called to contact our rep that your are referring to.\n\nThank you,'}< /Response>

I had a horrible experience with this company. This was last summer, but the issue just came up again, which prompted me to leave a review. I paid quite a bit of money to have an issue fixed with my AC unit. It worked great for a short period of time and then it started acting up again. I contacted the rep who originally helped me and received the run around. He told me that it was normal for my unit to act the way it was, which wasn’t accurate. He said he would come back and take a look, but he didn’t show up on the date and time that we agreed upon. I recently ended up having a friend of mine fix the issue for this summer, who informed me that it was indeed not fixed properly the first time. Save your money and your time and go with another company. Based on the responses to the other poor reviews, I’m sure the company will attempt to discredit me in their response. It’s so difficult to find good customer service these days.< /text>

it started with a very pleasant conversation  with Jill as we discussed about the issue I was having. The appointment we made was very convenient and Ross, the tech was not only  prompt but very professional and courteous as well. After a thorough explanation of the issue, he gave me different options in addressing my concerns and I could tell that he was very knowledgeable. I sensed a lot of honesty from this man. I got a follow up call from the company the following day which is great customer service. What a TRULY EXCEPTIONAL EXPERIENCE!  I recommend this company VERY HIGHLY<//Text>

<Text>Colt and his team member arrived on time and was very professional and organized.  They kept the work area clean and communicated everything they were doing during installation, explaining the various details on connections and functionality.  Install took about 3.5 hrs and they cleaned up and before leaving ensured the water heater was working fine.  Would highly recommend their services< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I can't say enough about Environmental Heating and Air! I had a problem with my HVAC system on a Saturday afternoon and the dispatcher was very pleasant and easy to work with. She quickly took down my information a dispatched a technician who arrived within an hour. Thomas was very knowledgeable, skilled, professional and had my system back and running within 10 minutes. In an era where customer service is becoming a lost art, the staff at Environmental Heating and Air clearly excelled at providing any and all of my HVAC needs. I recommend them without hesitation.< /Text>

The install team, Ryan, Roy, and Eddy were polite, professional, and efficient—couldn’t ask for more.  In and out, right on schedule, no muss, no fuss.  I highly recommend these guys!!

Update:   Rodney came out and did our 6-month service today.   Thorough, professional,  and comprehensive!   Makes me happy, again, that we chose this company to do our system!< /review>

< review>
Called in to have someone come out and check our ac unit. The person who answered sounded very annoyed and impatient with me. After I gave him all my information he tells me that he can’t schedule anyone to come out because we are tenants so we have to have the land lord call. Our landlord lives in Sweden it’s currently 4am for him. He than hangs up quickly. Pretty rude!< /review>

All of our customer care representatives are female, so I need to determine who you spoke with so I can listen to the call recording with them and identify how we could gave served you better.\n\nIf you called in after 7 PM, the phones would have transferred over to a 3rd party answering service, which we have been coaching consistently on how to answer and support our customers. We are exploring all our options here, but a 3rd party answering service is our best solution as of right now until we can staff 24/7, which for a small to medium size business is simply not feasible.\n\nUnfortunately in the world we live in today, we are not allowed to perform any work on a home without the homeowners verbal or written consent. They have to give us permission before we can do anything.\n\nWe would be happy to wave any diagnostic fee if you can have the homeowner call us and authorize us to work on their equipment.\n\nAgain, we apologize for the way anyone of our team members, or people associated with our company made you feel.\n\nIt is simply not acceptable and until we hear feedback such as this, how would we know?\n\nI only wish the feedback was direct to our team and not in the form if a 1 star review, but that is also the world we now live in.'}<//Response>

<text>I have had several interactions with environmental heating and air. They have been accurate and efficient in helping me sort out and fix problems with my air conditioning that was poorly installed by another company. I have had several interactions over the phone with Charles in the office. He is courteous, professional, and has gone above and beyond!  I’ve had a good overall experience. Thomas the service tech was very thorough in the examination of my system.Hands down, I would recommend them to anyone looking for service on their heating and air.

Environmental Heating & Air Solutions is truly a professional company! They were wonderful when they installed our heater and cooler system. And they are fantastic with our annual check up and maintenance program! Rodney Mejorado did a great job with diagnostics and tuneup of the whole heater/cooling system. He also helped us with future options with our plan of replacing our old water heater. Thanks, Rodney!</Review>

Our somewhat new air conditioner went out recently and my wife and I were not happy with the big corporate company we used originally. After getting over 15 estimates we decided to go with Environmental Heating and Air due to their professionalism and reputation. The experience couldn't have been better from the initial appointment to the installation. They left our home spotless and nice and cool on a recent 90+ degree day. Would highly recommend to anyone in need of their services!</review>

Installed a complete ac/heat system in our home. From start to finish everything went smoothly. To begin with, Dan laid out some good options and then scheduled us promptly. From then on, we had good communication with the company. They were on time, nothing was rushed, and the installers are courteous and professional. Now everything looks clean and tidy. Oh, and we never had to hear 'there was an issue' or 'we have a situation' as the job was planned out properly from start to finish. The financing was a simple process too, really simple.

We are also quite pleased with the system that we chose and are looking forward to many years of good service and communication with Environmental Heating & Air. Was happy to have chosen them to help us with something that is very important to us. Thanks again!< /review>

<text>Our sales rep Matt Hooten was very knowledgeable and helpful. He even followed up with the install crew to make sure everything went as we had discussed. Everyone at this company has been very kind and professional. LOVE our new water softener. We didn't even realize how hard our tap water was, its lime night and day now.<//text><GmapID>0x809b219ca5624b01:0xfed24a875d8e8051< /GmapID><Date>1548952229163< /Date><rate>5< /rate><pictures>None< /pictures>< Name>

After many issues with our existing system we finally decided it was time for a new system when we came home to water pouring out of our light fixture. I called Environmental Heating & Air on a Friday and started working with Kevin Coulter. He was so on top of everything, knowledgeable and quick to respond. I could really tell he knew what he was talking about which is very reassuring when making a home investment. We were able to start our install on Tuesday. The install crew that came out (Matt, Colt and Connor) were awesome! They were so fast and detailed about their work and very professional. They explained all of their work to me and showed me every detail of the finished product. Just looking at the new system I can tell there is no possibly way we would ever encounter the nightmare we did with our old system. The install on this system is immaculate and they cleaned up the entire job after, it was as if they were never there - with the exception of having a nice cool house now!!! I am beyond satisfied with every aspect of service received from Environmental Heating and Air.< /review>

The technician showed up in short notice despite a scheduling error on my part. I was thrilled with the professionalism and courtesy I was shown. I was nice enough to put co era over his boots to help keep my house clean and went out of his way to clean up a mess that my ac left in my attic. Great organization, great business. I definitely recommend this company to any of my friends and family that has issues with ac.< /Review>

We've been extremely happy with how the system turned out. They were able to move the AC unit from under our bedroom window to the side of the house. Noise from the blower and motor were a big concern. The install crew took the time to insulate the furnace closet and that really made the system quiet.
We don't have to turn down the TV!!! The little things ya know.
Give Environmental a try. You will not be disappointed.<//review>< pictures>

Greg, Hans, and Peter.  I can't thank you enough for knowing your Lennox  furnace SLP98V Signature Collection.  Four and half years later I was told by Hans I  had the wrong thermostat.  I  investigated a little  and to my surprise he was correct in order for my furnace to operate the way it's meant to.   Gilmore,  a well known company denied this and said everything is working as it should.  Needless to say I got my i comfort S30 and a Reme Halo along with a HVAC maintenance plan. Honesty is what this Company is all about. Excellent customer service;  less than 2 hours to install on the same-day of Gilmores rejection of correcting their  mistake of wrong thermostat installed.  Sad to say Gilmore Sales and Service manager did not know Lennox furnace .<//text>

Lorenzo is amazing.  He took time to explain all that he did and showed pictures.  He also made recommendations that would need to be completed in a few months.  Sometimes technicians try to get customers to  fix things ASAP but Lorenzo said that it would need to be completed in a couple months.< /Text>

Noel, my Environmental Heating & Air Solutions Service Technician, just completed my very first Diagnostic Analysis and I must say I couldn’t have been more pleased!!!  Noel thoroughly explained what I could expect during the appointment and then proceeded to conduct the analysis as expected.  He also provided helpful tips to ensure my unit would work efficiently.   Thanks Noel!!!!<//text>

We have been using EHA since January, 2013 to service our heating and air conditioning systems. They have always been very professional in their dealings with us. Very thorough, explain everything so you understand what is going on, and very fair. We ended up signing a maintenance contract that provides tune ups each year to both systems and discounts on service calls. They willingly come back if the problem wasn't solved the first time. They never pressure you to make any particular repair. We highly recommend them!< /Text>

Today, I had a technician named Carrey come to my residence to remedy a problem with the unit. He was knowledgeable, competent, and professional. He went over all the details of what he planned to do and when  the job was completed he explained everything to me. He worked diligently the entire time he was here. I was so impressed with Kerry's competence and professionalism.   He represents a company!😀</review>

It's been a while since I have felt like I received 5 star system check. Rodney Mejorado was the technician who did my check and he took his time and I really felt like he did a thorough job. Thank you to Rodney and I hope he is my technician next time as well.<//Review>

This review is a bit different... In today’s times, it seems it can be very difficult to find a reputable company, especially in the construction industry... Well, you’ve found one here! I’ve been in the heating and air world for about 15 years now, and have had the opportunity to work with hundreds of HVAC contractors all over North America in many different aspects, primarily from business coaching, marketing and training for manufacturers and distributors. Environmental Heating & Air Solutions is a company who truly takes pride in what they do and I’ve seen them make a strong effort over the years to put their customers and employees first. They are an extremely reliable company and you can’t go wrong utilizing them for maintenance, repair service, or a new system installation... Don’t look around any longer, their team will take care of you!< /text>

< Review>
We had the pleasure of having Environmental Heating and Air Solutions do a full replacement of our heat and air unit with new ducting and added new attic insulation after their work was done. From the estimate to the installation we felt comfortable through the whole process.

Greg and his crew came out for the installation! They not only stayed on schedule, they were knowledgeable, professional, careful, and clean when working inside and out side our home.

After having the new unit and adding attic insulation, the unit hardly runs vs our old unit would run all day all night and never get to desired temp. Our house has never been so comfortable! Also our electric bill has dropped drastically!

So without hesitation I would recommend this company!< /Review>

< Review>
Our technician Thomas M. did an outstanding job servicing our heating system. He is extremely knowledgeable, thorough, and completed the job in a timely manner. He offered suggestions to improve our filtration system to decrease dust which will be great!
When he serviced our Air Conditioning last spring, he was able to locate and repair a leak that had been difficult to find. Also did a thorough cleaning of the outside coils.
Environmental Heating and Air installed our HVAC and we have been very pleased with the product and service they provide!

These guys are top notch! Nowel and Michael exemplify customer first mentality. My AC went down with 100° temperatures and this is the only company of about half a dozen I called that could accommodate same day visit.

Nowel showed up at close to 9pm and worked unrelentingly to diagnose the problem. As it turns out I had a refrigerant leak. Nowel came back the next day as promised.

In between visits I did my due diligence and saw what pride and care Michael the Ops MGR took to make sure most social media reviews were responded to and all issues addressed/resolved. So I decided to call him in between the first and second visit to have a candid conversation regarding cost concerns acknowledging they have a business to run. Michaels response was textbook “we want you to be happy and not at the expense of making a profit”. He went on to explain they will work with me and not to worry.

Nowel showed up today and did just that, worked with me on every line item to make sure he answered every question I had (sometimes 2-3x asked differently) and agree to a price that I was comfortable with and made sense for all.

In a hyper competitive industry where it’s hard to decipher honesty and integrity from the rest, these guys are the real deal for sure. Highly recommend! Thank you Michael and Nowel!!< /Text>

These guys are top notch! Nowel and Michael exemplify customer first mentality. My AC went down with 100° temperatures and this is the only company of about half a dozen I called that could accommodate same day visit.

Nowel showed up at close to 9pm and worked unrelentingly to diagnose the problem. As it turns out I had a refrigerant leak. Nowel came back the next day as promised.

In between visits I did my due diligence and saw what pride and care Michael the Ops MGR took to make sure most social media reviews were responded to and all issues addressed/resolved. So I decided to call him in between the first and second visit to have a candid conversation regarding cost concerns acknowledging they have a business to run. Michaels response was textbook “we want you to be happy and not at the expense of making a profit”. He went on to explain they will work with me and not to worry.

Nowel showed up today and did just that, worked with me on every line item to make sure he answered every question I had (sometimes 2-3x asked differently) and agree to a price that I was comfortable with and made sense for all.

In a hyper competitive industry where it’s hard to decipher honesty and integrity from the rest, these guys are the real deal for sure. Highly recommend! Thank you Michael and Nowel!!</Text>

Environmental Heating and Air Solutions provided everything they promised.
They called me for the maintenance appointment.
They showed up when they said they would.
Rodney M was the service tech.  He was very polite and answered every question I asked him.< /Text>

<Review>After looking around for a new unit for over 3 months. I started to give up, i wanted to give it one last shot so I then called this company. As i made my appointment i felt it was going to be another waste of time and just trying to upsale me for every penny i have. As the date came to my appointment, Kevin C was very professional, he came to my door with a positive attitude. I had a lot of questions and he had great answers, He was very detailed in his explanations. After getting an estimate, kevin made me very confident with my purchase. I Would definitely recommend him to anyone! I will also be letting my family know to give him a call for their new Outdated unit. I am officially a loyal customer. Thanks Kevin!< /Review>< rating>

Always a reminder call for my scheduled checkup and a call from tech saying they're on their way with an ETA.
If there's any problem or additional maintenance that needs to be done it is thoroughly explained. I never feel like I'm asking a silly question.
I have and will continue to recommend Environmental Heating & Air.<//text>

I really appreciate him. He is very knowledgeable.
The install team came on time and completed the job in less than a day. They are experienced diligent professionals who worked as a team and communicated well with each other and me.
I am very happy with the cost. Top quality products at a fair price. Costco financing is great at 2.99%. Go with Kevin & EHA Solutions. You will be glad you did.
P.S. Lennox system is very quiet. Also has app for your phone in case you forget or  want to change settings.< /review>< GmapID>

<review>When you have a child with serious medical needs, the last thing you want to have happen on a hot day is for the air conditioner to go out. Environmental Heating and Air Solutions came highly recommended so it was literally a no brainer who to call. Environmental understood how serious our situation was and very quickly and conveniently had Service Tech Ross out to our home. Ross was not only very prompt to arrive, but super professional, very well knowledge and very understanding of our situation and figured out our problem. Unfortunately we did need a new system...
That being said Enviormental as a whole, Matt the owner and Ross the service tech and installer of our new system made our stressful situation better. Everyone at Environmental was great and easy to work with! They even cleaned up their mess which is very professional in itself. When Ross left we were in full understanding how our new system and thermostat worked. Environmental is top notch and I highly recommend this company to anyone needing any type of HVAC work done.<//review><name>Jennifer Bell< /name></record>

My HVAC specialist was excellent from all  aspects of buisness. His knowledge was outstanding! In fact Thomas was the only technician that had the skills and knowledge to register us onto the lennox site.  Its been a year now since I could see what the temp is outside .displayed on my thermostat. He taught me alot about my system and care for it. What an asset to your company.
Thank you ,

I’ve known Matt, the owner for most of my life personally and professionally. We have worked with Environmental Heating and Air on several occasions, as an insulation sub contractor. I’ve seen so many clients over the years who were thankful for their service and had a great overall experience. We usually come in when the job is complete so we get to see the finished project and hear feedback from the homeowner. Anytime there’s been a situation Matt has made sure it’s handled as soon as possible for his clients. Kevin Coulter is an amazing tech and has so much thoughtfulnesss and knowledge about customer service and HVAC. Matt’s team is solid and he is committed to each clients satisfaction. I truly believe in this company because Matt and Kevin have integrity and they care about people getting what they expected with their project. I would recommend Environmental Heating and Air to anyone who owns a home and needs a trust worthy company to to take care of their HVAC stystem.< /Review>

I live in Benicia CA and after my son, who also lives in Benicia, had his home HVAC system replaced by Environmental H&A Solutions and had good experience, we had them replace our furnace and added air-conditioning in June 2017.  We went with the high efficiency Lennox products and have been very happy.  We also had them install a tank-less water heater in October 2017.  I was extremely pleased with how well the projects were planned, installed and serviced afterwards.  Every person we dealt with from the sales, installers, service monitoring and the office personnel in Roseville were the kind of folks that delivered service on time, in professional manner and never disappointed us. The folks that came to the house freely exchanged info as to what they were doing, so nice these days.
I would highly recommend if you want a business you can count on for your home's heating and air-conditioning.< /Text>

The salesperson Mr. Coulter was not only empathetic but kind and knowledgeable. He found the issue and suggested fixes but in the end we decided to simply replace the system.

Mr. Coultre’s deminer, thoroughness and the fact that he had a golden lab puppie just like ours made the decision easy.

Thank you Mr. Coultre. Thank you</review>

After getting tired of spending too much on bottled water my wife and I decided to get a water purification system installed in our house. (May 2017) I LOVE the new system and my tap water now taste better than bottled water. We purchased a Puronics system.  Install was next day and seamless.

In early August I was out of town on business and my wife called me in panic because our AC was not working. We have a young toddler and it was 110 degrees outside. Not having AC was not an option. I remember that the experience we had with Environmental Heating and Air so I called around 5pm to see if they could look at my house ASAP. Matt, the owner, came by my house around 6:30pm and setup and delivered two portable AC units so my wife could put our son to bed. He checked my heating unit in the attic and saw that the drip pan was about to overflow. They drained my drip pan and after the technician did some test to see why it was failing. EHS replaced the capacitor tried to fix my old compressor, but it still failed. We decided to go with a new system. We chose the Lennox XC25-AC and SLP98 furnace. It is really nice to be able to adjust the temperature zones on our phone. The install was booked and installed two days later.

Now we have had TWO excellent experiences with EHA. To top it off last month they provided me with two club level tickets to the San Jose Sharks game! The tickets cam with free food, drinks and parking. EHA has exceeded all my expectations and has provided a great value. I would recommend them to a friend and would absolutely call them again if needed.</Text>

This company tried to charge me $350 for a service that I was quoted from multiple other companies as being $70-$100. Also, when I asked for prices on things like freon they would not tell me over the phone. I  had to agree to an $89 fee for them to visit my house before any prices would be given. Some shady practices and what looks like price gouging.<//text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>I booked my appointment to repair my a/c late last night through Google and received an email confirmation for my scheduled appointment from 8 am to 10:00 am. I waited for the technician to arrive from 8 am to 10:10 am but decided to call to check on the appointment since no one showed. Apparently what I had booked was tentative which there was no indication of in the slightest. The appointment itself was buried in their system. The rep explained it was a new system but it didn’t make my wasted time any easier to swallow. Additionally there were no other times available the same day. Add on the fact that the advertised price of $69 cost for diagnostic was actually $89.  This was a pretty bad experience.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1623960308670, 'text': 'We truly apologize for your experience and are working with our providers to get a better understanding of how this brand new feature on Google works.
