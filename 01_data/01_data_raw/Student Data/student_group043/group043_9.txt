<Text>I've made it a point to visit this shop any time I'm in SoCal. The staff is very personable and knowledgeable plus the shop has an excellent product selection. The Baby Jeeter mini pre-rolls are my absolute favorite!! They do not disappoint!!< /Text>< Pics>

I’ve been coming here for years. They always carry the products I want or the products I ask about. Everyone is super cool,  chill  and patient. I never feel pressured or rushed to get something I don’t want. Clean friendly Covid safe and most importantly affordable. Thanks for being a reliable place for flower and cannabis needs. Thanks for joking it up. You have a customer for life.</Review>

<Text>This pandemic has been crazy! But the one consistent necessity I can say throughout this whole insanity has been LACC, my neighborhood dispensary for all my cannabis needs. From flower to pens to joints to edibles, LAVC has everything at incredible prices. I absolutely Iove  ALL the budtenders who I see on an almost daily basis. They’re always incredibly friendly and super helpful. I always walk out of LAVC in a better mood than when I went in. Thanks to everyone who works there and to Dmitry for making and keeping this magical Los Angeles local shop a reality. I don’t know where I would be if I couldn’t have my ESSENTIAL cannabis from the greatest shop in LA. Merry Christmas and Happy Holidaze!! 🎄🤶🏻🎅🏻🔥🌳🍁<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMEgeW-VeBgqnwLNEfUaigN0IqOOOCma3VQLvm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Resp>

Expensive weed. No big selections.
Careless background music(top40) on the bad sound system.
Unfriendly service. So so foods.
Nothing to see here. The money grab tourist trap. Don't waste your time<//Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><pics>None<//pics><text>This is my regular shop in the neighborhood of my office down on Wilshire. They are one of the few shops in the city that fully recognize my CA State Medical card and offer me the proper tax deductions without any questions. The tenders and managers treat me like family, maybe because I'm usually in at least once a week, but still. These folks run a stellar operation, and have continued to provide me quality service by delivering to my home near Hollywood through the COVID pandemic shutdowns. Had to come over to Google to show them some extra love while they're going above and beyond to deliver to my door. I feel bad for anyone who has written a bad review here citing a bad experience, has never been the case for me. Give them a first, second, third chance; they're great people who deserve your business.<//text><Time>1588965876373<//Time><username>Jeremy Miller< /username><Response>{'time': 1588996249720, 'text': 'thank you very much for the review , we appreciate your business!'}</Response><GmapID>0x80c2b93c05438b91:0x4768636a8cae6e54< /GmapID><user>116523182871694717561</user></record></dataset><record>

This is my local neighborhood dispensary. Everyone is always friendly and knowledgeable about all the products. Their Customer appreciation events are always a welcome along with the Pizza Parties! Seriously, the only dispensary that invited me to a pizza party that actually had enough pizza and soda and snacks. Plus their is so much dope art to put on your IG.< /review>

Got totally ripped off here. My wife & I did some shopping. One of the products (Indica flower) was completely unusable. Stale, dry...buds crumpled into dust. Would not burn. We immediately called to let them know (they did not seem shocked over the phone, mind you). We were just stonewalled & given the runaround ("managers come in & out, can't tell you when they're in"; "cannot leave managers a message"; "try calling the grower--sometimes they will help") Clearly this was ruined due to improper storage & handling.
This is the worst experience we've had at any dispensary (been to ~10).
Disappointing & unethical people.</review>< pics>

Been my favorite dispensary since I moved to the neighborhood 3 years ago.  They always stock quality product and the staff is all super nice and is knowledgeable.  Prices are good too.  Still wish they had the weekend wheel of fortune, but alas - it's still the store I go to pretty much exclusively. ;)</text>

<text>Been in a few times and Erin was the most helpful. The selection is wide and prices are very fair. The nice thing is they don’t rush you like some and actually are interested. Even when I was in a bad mood they had great attitude. It was just once that I was ignored but over all 5. My wife really likes this place.< /text>< Response>

This is my favorite dispensary. It’s small, but never super packed and their selection is great for their size. The staff is what keeps me coming back. Even though the interactions are brief, everybody here makes me feel like family. There’s a parking lot right next door and LAVC will validate, but I always go later at night and park right out front at a meter. Will always come here.<//Text>

Budtender Caitlin was extremely knowledgeable and pointed me towards some incredible Indica I wouldn’t have otherwise chosen myself. Loved the atmosphere of the shop, with a lovely staff as well. Would 100% go there first if visiting LA for bud.</Text>

<text>Small neighborhood dispensary with friendly staff and excellent service. I bought a Kurvana cartridge that started leaking from the top and they replaced it for free. Would recommend!</text></record>

I’m not one to leave a review (good or bad) but this customer service was so bad I decided I had to let people know. I had called in to ask if they had a strain in stock named Super Green Crack (as shown on there weedmaps page). They told me they do not have it and I shouldn't refer to Weedmaps cause its not accurate (even though it showed “updated 2hours ago”). So the guy on the phone tells me “we’ll we have another strain just like it called Jack Kraken” so I said oh ok kool thanks. We hung up. I googled the strain and every single breeder talked about what a great Indica it is. So i called back to make sure I have the right name for the strain and the same guy tells me “no its not an indica it is Green Crack and Jack herre  combined. Come in and take a look” I told him it was far (35-40min far) but I'm excited to try that now and will try to stop in. I go stop in. I show up all happy and excited. I check in and then this chick starts helping me and I tell her the whole story about the super green crack and how they said to come in a get the Jack Kraken and she tells me “oh no theres no green crack in that its a sativa hybrid at best” so now I'm confused because the guy told me its was a mix of those two strains..now she starts getting defensive and has an attitude while I'm explaining to her that I came from quite far away cause of what they told me over the phone and how every breeder online shows this to be an indica and super green crack is a pure sativa and they tell me “oh you cant believe the internet cause all the breeders are different”. So I shouldn't believe the whole internet but believe them who messed up and told me the Jack Kraken had green crack and jack herre in it?? The bud tender lady still short and aggressive starts telling me to buy other strains they have and to “just buy one of those”, I did not travel 40min for your over priced Jack Herre strain that I could get closer to my place for cheaper. This is where my review becomes helpful to the establishment. When you are at fault and have giving the customer wrong information causing this much of an incovience, you have compassionate and find a way to
compensate, that chick working there should not be in
any field of customer service. She then half way “helping” me (arguing), left and didn't come back. Talk about insult to injury not only did they tell me the wrong thing, I drove all the way down and wasted gas, and then showed up to be talked to rudely. Shame on that bud tender and all the people that were there 2/7/20 that could not think of one way to make the establishment seem good and responsible for there actions by showing fault and finding a way to please the customer they've wronged.< /Text>

<review>Been trying to check out all the dispensaries in the area and decided to check LAVC out, store was easy to locate and was very clean and tidy.. costumer service was amazing and they helped me find what I was looking for..
I really enjoyed the glass displays as it made the experience feel a lot more chill, kinda like a showcase anyway I was digging the vibe.. A little pricey on cartridges maybe 5-10$ more than other places in the area but they gave me a 10% discount as a first time buyer. The flower looked very nice, haven't tried it but the prices were relatively cheap and the product looked pretty and I'm sure it'll be tasty. :-)< /review><response>None</response><date>1536121076609< /date></record></dataset><record>

I experienced 2 instances of pretendo here. Stay away from the 1/2 gram pre-rolls. I tried Ghost OG and Mochi, smoked them all by myself and barely felt a thing.

My bigger issue was that when I went to let them know, dude with the curly blonde hair blamed the supplier and didn’t apologize or make any attempt whatsoever to appease my complaint. The second I asked if I could make a complaint he began rolling his eyes at me and started multitasking.

I wish they handled my complaint a little nicer; I would have liked to try out some more of their products before resorting to a boycott. Oh well, guess my business isn’t worth anything to them.</text>

LAVC always has the biggest variety of bud, concentrates, edibles, and more! I have been coming here for almost a year now and they never disappoint on quality and customer service. The people that work at LAVC are always attentive and more than willing to help you find what you’re looking for. Also, they have good prices for the location that it is in. Thank you LAVC for the good bud and vibes that you bring! Check this place out.</text>

<Review>Man this place gots e juice for the player price!!!!! I asked the price of a juice they had and when i was told the price it honestly took the ability to comprehend right away from me because i was in utter shock at how the price of these premiere e juices where so low. I was at a loss of words, i mean im just now able to type this review 8 hours later. 5 stars.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<review>One of the best places to get vape juices. 10 dollars for all of their 60ml juices. All other things are comparable to other vape and smoke shops. I travel from Sacramento at least once a month to get juices. Some times they sell out.< /review>< Pics>

Good customer service,  great selection of everything you could want in a smoke shop, and great prices!  Their Kratom prices are nearly the same as some online prices.< /Text>

Last night was my first time stopping by Even tho for me I have to pay a toll but it was well worth it. I really like the fact they are open till 11 espec on a Sunday! Where most are closed early. And they had a variety selection of juices I wanted online because i never saw in store. They have a good selection of nice vape mods and kits espec coloured ones not just your average black and silver. I got 2 60ml juices at 20ea that's sweet cuz normally id be paying  $25 at least. And another thing I truly appreciated was they didn't rush me out while time was their close time, they were very understanding and it showed they  care about their new customers being comfortable</text>

My review is the same as the people who have already reviewed them. However I have never been in a laundromat that was so big and everything was working. The parking lot is small yet big enough. There are these big  laundry carts ( they have regular ones as well as ). Also I was there on New Year's day around 3 o'clock. I had 20 loads out in 2 hours.</review>

This is the place to go if you want your clothes clean. Great staff. I used to go to the free dry place but they are always so crowded and with the way things are these days I'll go to this place.</review>

The price of the small washers went from $3 to $3.25, after they switched management. And they lower the temperature for the dryers, so it is not as hot anymore. I used to put $0.50 to dry my clothes but now I have to put $0.75 - $1.00 for every dryers I use.< /text>

Amazing customer service! So friendly and helpful, a little slow with only one person working. But tons of choices! The build your own fries were amazing and the churro ice cream bun was even better!! Made with thrifty ice cream!< /Review>

Good eats. Menu is a little confusing bc of the font & layout but fits the theme! Clean inside, employees were nice, service was a tad slow. Ordered fries, tacos, pretzel and churro.</text>

< Review>
Fun treats but service is very slow and rude. Showed up at 3pm as they opened and had to wait 20 min for a funnel cake. When I asked why I had to wait so long I was given a lame duck excuse and an attitude. After a verbal berating from the "owner" I was asked to leave and that I was not welcome back. Definitely not the way to treat paying customers.<//Review>

Staff was very friendly and food was very good. Yes we had to wait for our food, but you could tell it was fresh. Would definitely wait again (the wait wasn’t that long)< /text>

Food is mediocre, prices are just as expensive as the fair. very stingy with the toppings. Funnel cake barely had any whipped cream on top, the bottom was soggy. My carne asada fries were more fries than meat, the toppings I asked for were practically nonexistent on there.< /Text>

Read the reviews and went there. Waited over ten minutes for the full order.. funnel cake got cold and when I asked what was taking so long, the owner said “this is not the place for you.” So I got my money back.. bad customer service. I guess it’s not the place for my money either. Would give 0 stars if I could</review>

Called for a last minute appointment, the guy who answered couldn't be anymore nice. They were able to squeeze me in for a gel manicure. The woman who did my nails did a wonderful job. She took her time- went above and beyond to make sure my nails were what I wanted. I would go back as it was clean and everyone was very nice.< /Review>

<Text>Great for a quick pedi. Always came before covid and just started going back now "post" covid. Not really distancing inside but everyone has masks and little dividers. I figure with the vaccine it's ok to get pedi again. Overall pedis come out really clean. A couple times the lady dug a little too deep in cleaning the cuticles and caused an infection 😑 so now I always let the know beforehand not to go too deep.< /Text>< pics>

Absolutely love this place. I live in Laguna Niguel and make the drive to go here. Nails always look so good and last for a long time. I usually get gel manicure and they last for a month!< /Text>

<text>Irvine nail and spa has been my go-to nail place for the past couple years. The place is always spotless and I feel safe getting my nails done here. I normally do regular polish, but sometimes I get gel for my mani's. Good selection of colors and friendly nail techs.< /text><username>Ivette Rombs<//username><userid>107074662415244698051</userid>< date>

Very clean and the ladies do a great job! However, I don’t like that they guilt you into cash tips - I never have cash on me and always get the rolling eyes when I tip with the credit card because they have to wait until the end of the week to get their tips. I have to wait every two weeks to get paid so I don’t feel bad, sorry.</text>

I highly recommend Irvine Nails.  The owner, Tracey, is so nice and accommodating.  James, who does my gel nails, is the best!  He's not a talkative person but really good at what he does.  I would also recommend Tyler or Jasmine as a very, very close second. I live in Costa Mesa and drive 30 minutes because they are that good.  Thank you!< /review>

I've been back a few times, and every time they do a great job on my nails!  The only issue I've ever had was when they couldn't find my reservation I made the day before, but they were still able to squeeze my sister and I in for our services.  Still totally happy with the quality and the price of this place!< /Review>

I've been a few times now and they really are all great. Each tech has shown the same meticulous attention to detail and gave me exactly what I wanted. Prices are fair and the salon is comfortable.
Rarely do I distribute 5 stars - but so far this nail salon is well deserving.
Update: this is still the best nail salon I've been to.<//Text>

I have been going here for about 2 years. And the they have always done amazing work. However, I have had some issues with Tracey and her professionalism when it comes to her attitude. She has had attidtude with me and other clients many times, and it’s unfortunate. Because of her, I won’t be going there any longer. In my opinion, they could use new management, which would help run the store a lot better.< /text>

Tracy is so sweet, thoughtful and great at managing a very busy/successful business. Nail technicians are always amazing. Massage chairs are never a disappointment :)<//review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>I am new to Irvine and needed my nails done for an event. I walked in to make an appointment and was immediately greeted with a clean smell and a dozen Hellos!! I made an appointment with Kim for the following day. I arrived for my appointment and again was greeted with a clean smell and a warm welcome from everyone!! I was taken to an amazing chair and Daum began my pedicure. Next Jasmine came over and asked what color I would like and I showed her a picture of what I wanted. I was shocked how excited both woman were when they got to do something fun.( other salons I have had woman roll eyes or mumble under their breath in disgust) Both women were perfectionist and took their time making sure my nails were perfect!! I am very happy with my nails and would highly recommend Irvine Nail and Spa to all my friends and Family!!<//review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

I recently moved here from Northern Cal. and had been looking for my new go-to nail salon. This is the place! I have been here 3 times and have been very pleased each time. At my last visit, I got a gel french manicure. That was almost 3 weeks ago and they still look great- not a single chip! I have been to the beach 3 times since having them done(dug in the sand and all), moved boxes, and washed dishes every day. The longest they ever lasted at my last go to salon was 2 weeks. This salon is clean, the manicurists are kind and professional, and the place runs very efficiently. My only gripe is that one of the guys is a little rough on my feet- he could be a little more gentle with the loufa and his grip. Otherwise I'm a very happy camper!< /text>

I've been around to quite a few nail salons and this place always does the best job. My service is never rushed or hurried, and the technicians always pay the greatest attention to detail. I'll never go anywhere else!< /Review>

<Review>I called to book an appointment, the associate said there was no need for one just to come in-no wait time she assured. I drive there and they where full. I said how long is the wait she was scrambling to give me an answer. Then I said how much for a pedi and mani she said $85. I was about to loose it. Poor customer service. I left and went to Vina nails on culver . Sweet staff. Linn was amazing, gel mani and pedi , full foot, leg and hand/arm massage. Foot scrub, hot towels, dual color and friendly staff all for $55 . Yes a savings of $30 🤗<//Review>< Pictures>

Do not come here. They charge way to much for the end product. I have always paid $35 for a full set of gel acrylic nails and have always loved the way they turn out when I go to other salons. They charged me $55 and they were all uneven and some were coffin shaped while others were square. Go somewhere else to get your nails done.</review>

I just stopped at this place because it’s a tad bit closer than my usual nail place. I walked in and it was busy which is ok because what nail place isn’t busy Saturday morning. But I Walked in and got eyed down from head to toe by the ladies without even being greeted or asked what i needed. I sat for a few minutes to wait and see if they would ask but apparently i was invisible. I walked out. Going to my regular place. I will be sticking to my girls at Star nail around the corner. I don’t know what I was thinking 🤔 if you want good service go to Star nails it’s less than a mile down.<//review>

I think I found my go to nail place!!  After my last place went under new management and my nail lady left California.  It's been 3 years and I've been jumping from place to place to find one that's friendly, priced well, and CLEAN.  They have sterilized tools, they have you initial before they open their bag.  I'll definitely will be a regular here.

If you're planning visiting on a weekend, I would make reservations as they have only 8 pedi chairs.  So far it's been my 2nd visit and both technician has been great and attentive.< /review>

My wife loves this place. They are usually busy so an appointment is reccomended. Mani Pedi is $22. As a guy I don't know if that's good or not, but the service is enjoyable. Nothing makes this place stand out from the others though< /Review>

It's a real shame that I will never step foot there again due to how rude there are. Twice I was refused by the girl servicing my nails! First time I was told that only a certain"Holly" would be OK to do my nails, and several months later when I called and politely asked for "Holly" the Lady at the desk, once she got my name, tells me Holly is refusing to do my nails! How insulting! And it's not like I'm asking for anything special. (I prefer to add a light pink to french nailpolish instead of transparent) This is completely unacceptable and unprofessional from their end. They make it seem like you work for them. How rude!<//text>

The salon is relatively quiet. I am not a fan of people constantly talking on cell phones or hearing them ring. That is why this is my new go-to place. I am always allowed a nice quiet enjoyable mani pedi.< /text>< Pics>

Today, I had every intention of providing the 5 star review that I feel like this salon typically deserves.  But, today, they were far from deserving :(
My appointment started late,  despite me arriving 5 min early.  That actually doesn’t bother me too much.
I just got a basic mani and pedi.  I was asked to sit in a salon chair that was knowingly broken by multiple technicians.  Yet, they still recommended I put on the massager.  My back is not feeling quite right now.  Will probably need to go to my chiropractor on Monday.
I asked for clear polish on my nails.  That was completely forgotten.  They are bare.  I’ve been so uncomfortable here that I just don’t want to say anything.
The technician who did my pedicure hurt my toes badly while clipping.  I yelped our on 3 occasions.  I typically prefer to get callus removal.  This was not even offered.  When I asked if I could get it, the technician declined because her arms are in so much pain and she just cannot do it.
After this, she proceeded to give me a very, very subpar massage.  He whole time I felt guilty because I knew she was in pain.  Why in the world is this young lady even working today?  I politely asked her to stop the massage and just finish up the polish because I felt so badly.
So, I’m wrapping up here with a subpar treatment, aching back and a whole heck of guilt.
Only reason they are getting 3 stars is because every other visit of mine has been awesome.
So....  what is it going to take for Irvine to get a nice nail salon that performs a great mani/pedi that doesn’t cost a million dollars???<//review><gmap_id>0x80dcdcf490e5f161:0x967e071fc27205a4<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Update: (03/04/18) The same exact service they wanted to charge me $50 for, I got it done for $10 from FID’S SMOG & TUNE here in West Sac. Folks, that shows you how awful this place is. Just watch your back when you step on their property.

ALSO, these people are vicious liars! I asked them in person a month before coming here about how much they would charge for an easy oil if I supplied my own oil and filter and they even said $20. So when I actually show up, they want $50. Nice try but I’d rather not be highway robbed of my money.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: (02/15/18) This Review is in regards to their auto service center.

These people will charge you $100 for a $40 service. Be very careful with what you buy from them and shop around first and compare prices before agreeing to their auto service.

I came this morning to them with my own oil and filter for my Honda Accord and even though every place wants $20 for an oil change if you supply your own oil and filter, they tried to charge me an insane $50 for it!

Never coming here again, they have no integrity if they are ripping off hard working consumers so easily.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1519494172716, 'text': "you want free service should let us know because you brought prius. sorry but we have to pay for used oil and other service. we are hard working people also and if you shop around for $20 then why come here should have gone to $20 place. Next time you go to the place that's better for you please don't waste you'r time and ours because we didn't do it for free."}< /resp><gmapID>0x809ad420025816eb:0xcfaf0823b338f85a< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I recently had my oil changed and all fluid check before going on a road trip.
Greg was very professional and neat in completing the job.  He also did some extra things without delay.  Would recommend this shop to anyone who wants a good and honest job done on the vehicle.</Text>

Greg has been working on my 2006 Dodge Van for the last 8 years.  Has always been a fair price and fixed correctly the first time.  I would not hesitate to recommend Circle A Auto Service Center to my friends.</review>

<Review>Greg has worked on many of our vehicles over the years.  He has replaced power steering box, front struts and brakes on our 82" Toyota Corolla; replaced valve cover gasket, expansion tank, radiator and fan on our 2003 BMW; replaced universal joint, distributor and pulled and replaced motor on 67' Ford 250 p/u.  Very knowledgeable, methodical and trustworthy.  Highly recommend using Greg at Circle A Auto Service Center</Review>< UserId.>

Great snacks and ice cream/ nieves choices.  Some flavors aren't that great but everyone has their own taste.< /Text>

<review>These desserts are delicious and they have a vegan option with dole whip too! They are a little pricey, but they are huge (so not bad if you are sharing). I tried the cinnamon sugar cone with vanilla and caramel sauce and my husband got the vegan option with a coconut covered cone and dole whip. Both were super tasty!< /review><Resp>None</Resp><time>1605847178121</time><gmapID>0x80c2c716179b796d:0xc63bcfb747a47e53</gmapID>< Pictures>

Don’t come here if you’re on a diet... I’m shocked at the friendliness and warmness of the staff here... they took their time to attend us and helped us out with all of our questions. Even if they served rocks in a tortilla (which they don’t) the amazing staff would keep me coming back...</review>

The perfect dessert place! They have natural or artificial flavors for ice cream, delicious snacks (hot Cheetos with cheese, fresh fruit with candy spices) and Mexican culture desserts Mangonada (cut up mango with mango ice cream, chamoy and other spices). My favorite is the rice pudding ice cream bar (has bits of rice in it) $2.50 and also love their Nuez (pralines) drink $3. Their water ice cream bars are $2 and the milk bars are 2.50. Honestly pretty cheap prices for the amazing tastes and flavors. Truly recommend.< /Text>

Diferentes sabores de paletas de Aqua y leche.
Different flavors of Water & Milk popsicles.
.
Came in on a Monday Night very chill atmosphere. They played variety of Spanish party music, employees were friendly & helpful. Asked if we wanted samples (as many as you want to try :D). I had the Fresa con leche & it was delicious.

Friend tried the fruity pebbles (taste like fruity pebbles lol) & chocolate de abuelita.

Must try this Place!</review>

(Translated by Google) I give them 2 stars! You can tell me how it is possible for a place that has 5 employees to take 3 cakes. It took me like 30 minutes to make 3 cakes. The drinks were okay, I called "Las Toxicas" but the service was terrible. I hope this is read by the owner or loaded because they need better order speed! 😡

(Translated by Google) I think the workers are too slow, they take a long time. Even if it's just one thing and they're not friendly at all. If you order by phone and you get to talk to them to ask about the order, they pretend they are not listening. Bad experience.

(Original)
Creo que Las trabajadoras son demasiado lentas se tardan muchisimo Aunque sea solo una cosa y no son nada amables. Si uno ordena por telefono y llega a hablarles para preguntar por la orden hacen como que no escuchan. Pesima experiencia.<//Review>

<Text>So I don't eat curry. It doesn't agree with me, but they have a few options! The food was great, the food smell doesn't overpower the atmosphere. Speaking of which, the restaurant is very nicely laid out, not cramped at all. The hostess was very attentive and kept the bread and water flowing. Though I wouldn't normally go to Indian restaurants I'd be more than happy to come back.

Thank you for the great service!< /Text>< date>

The lamb was very good.  Not a big curry fan but my meal was very enjoyable.  If you love curry you will not be disappointed.  My wife like curry and proclaimed we will return for the curry fish.</review>

<Name>Ashi Vinod</Name><Date>1513555203873< /Date><Rating>2</Rating><Review>I love the food at most of the India oven restaurants. Unfortunately the buffet at the Lincoln location did not meet my expectations. I went into the restaurant around 12pm and it was empty. Most of the India oven restaurants are busy. My family was the only customer at the restaurant.

1. First of all, the restaurant needs to clean their bathrooms, put toilet papers and seat covers. Although we were the only customers, I expected clean bathrooms. It was very dirty and I didn't want to use it
2. The restaurant floors were dirty. It seems like they have not cleaned since the previous night.
3. Some of the appetizers were cold and hard. It did not taste fresh since the restaurant opened prior to my family reaching there.
4. The rice was a little hard.

I don't think the restaurant will survive of they continue at this rate. I'm not going back to the Lincoln location in future.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1513881134033, 'text': "We always do our best to present a clean atmosphere as well as fresh food, Ashi, and we're sorry if you experienced anything that was out of the ordinary.

<text>I have eaten here a few times and would go here daily!  This is by far the best Indian food I have had.  The food is cooked with love. The Tandori is moist inside and falls off the bone.  Curry's are excellent and of course the Naan.  The staff are friendly as well!  I will be going back many more times and wish their business the best of success!</text>< pictures>

We were the only one persent, so the cashier promoted their Indian oven card to us.  We accepted the offer to get a free buffet next time, and other offers.  I explained we live in N.Natomas and will go there.   I used the couppns, and guess what, the coupons were invalid. Joke was on us because i had to pay twice and food was also bad.  And the service in N.Natomas was especially bad.  Overall, pretty bad experience,  and would not recommend.<//Review>< pictures>

Told the staff there countless times how delicious their food was. I really enjoyed the cury in my Malai Kofta. I could eat that with rice all day. The garlic naan was very tasty as well. In addition to their superb food, they had great service. They were very polite and attentive. This will be our go to Indian restaurant!<//Text>

This was a terrible experience!!! My sunroof started to act up so I found ORR and chose this place based on Yelp reviews. Boy, was that a mistake!!! I scheduled a 12:30 appointment, but took it in earlier, at 8. The man at the desk said it would be fine and they would take at look at my car after the one they were working on.  At about 10:30 I got an automated text asking if I was okay with work estimate of $139.00. I agreed to it. At 3:15 or so when I had not heard from them I called, only to have them tell me they hadn't ordered part yet or calculated my total.  Confused, I asked what the estimate was for, if not for the work! He said for diagnostic inspection.  He would call me back shortly with total.  At 5:10 when I had still not heard back, I called again only to have the put me on hold for about 10 minutes and come on to tel me it would be $860. I said no thanks!  Turns out they took the liberty to run a full inspection on my entire car. Chris & Nathan they did this as a courtesy to me. HA!!! I  asked them to check my rooftop, what made them think it was okay to check my entire car! Horrible communication, deceitful practices, and terrible customer service.< /Text>

I found Orr automotive on Yelp. My dealership was booked but my check engine light was on. Orr automotive was able to see me that week and solved the problem! Very kind receptionist and everyone was helpful and welcoming! I will be coming back for any other car issues.</Text>

I had a very difficult, hard to diagnose, problem with the electrical system in my 2017 Subaru, which caused my battery to frequently lose its charge.  Apparently, it's a problem with 2017 Subaru Foresters.  The mechanic took all the time he needed and spared no effort to discover the source of the problem and fix it.  It took some time, but he didn't give up and didn't just tell me I needed to drive it more frequently (which I've since learned other mechanics have done when faced with this problem.)</Text>

Fantastic shop! Very kind, quick and courteous. Had my issue diagnosed quickly and my car back on the road in no time. Would recommend this shop to all my friends and family. Their price is fair and they stand by their repair with a great warranty.< /text>

My daughter had previously used Orr for an analysis of a problem she was having with her car, so I called hoping to get some information for another problem she was having with her car. I cannot tell you how much I appreciated the advice Nate gave me over the phone! He went above and beyond to help me. He couldn’t have been nicer or more helpful. I can’t thank him enough!<//Text>

Orr Automotive is honest, respectful and trustworthy. I feel confident in knowing I will receive quality work anytime I may need to bring in my vehicle. I was informed of an issue that was found when having taken my car in for a different issue. With that, of course, came an unexpected expense. There was no pressure and I was told to just take time and think about it, they would be happy to service the issue if I decided. I’m very happy with their service and definitely recommend them for your repair needs.</Text>

I have found the shop for my current and future cars. From the first visit, the staff at Orr Automotive made me feel welcomed. They are straight forward, do not hesitate to answer all my questions and thoroughly explain their service recommendations. Their passion for cars and what they do provides me with a sense of security that my cars will be well taken care of. Most importantly their prices are great! I have and will continue to recommend this shop to others. Thanks again Orr Automotive!!< /Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>The mechanics here are good people. I've been taking my Volvo S40 there for over 3 years. They do quality repairs with fair prices. They have been nothing but helpful and kind. Nate always explains the car problem in terms that I understand and shows me the parts that were replaced. When I'm tight on money he lets me know what needs to be done now and what can wait plus they offer carecredit to help with the payments. When I had an accident and other person's insurance provided me with a rental car Orr dealt with the rental company regarding how long I would need the rental for. He also advised me on how to deal with the guy that hit me because he just wanted to give me cash instead of go through his insurance. Nate advised against that and thank goodness because the cost of the damages were WAY more than the guy was offering. That's just a few of the many ways that he has helped me out over the years.

I would recommend this auto shop to anyone that wants an honest mechanic with quality service at an affordable price.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80c3319a0ac0ab67:0x30ba7beda3f072c7<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

While visiting friends in Montclair, my wife's Toyota Matrix started leaking under the dash (on her new suede shoes!). We weren't excited about the idea of another breakdown driving from Southern to Northern California, but neither were we excited about going to an unfamiliar mechanic. After research, we found ourselves at Orr Automotive and we're super glad we did.

John treated us right. He walked us through the steps of his diagnosis, took us out to the car to show us his findings, and gave us a discount on additional issues he found 'since he was digging around anyway.' Chris treated us well, too, driving us back to our spot and chatting us up about auto maintenance tips and life in Montclair.

Tl;dr: if you need a diagnosis and solution to a car problem in the Montclair area, go to Orr Automotive. They were kind, knowledgeable, treated us fairly, and acted like they truly wanted to solve our problem affordably and with quality.< /review>

I've had nothing but good experiences at Orr. This time they took care of a pretty big repair in an amazingly fast time so that we could go on vacation on time. I also appreciate that they are always honest and don't try to sell you on fixing stuff that doesn't need to be fixed.  Via Sure Critic< /Review><Date>1420776691076<//Date></record></dataset><record>

I've been coming here faithfully for my oil changes and also a few years ago my car was under warranty thru Carmax and they sent me here. They are very helpful to me all the time. I highly recommend this place for all your maintenance and car issues. They are very friendly and will definitely take care of you.</Review>

I have to say and this is a little late to write this but Nate did a awesome job on my Nissan Altima. Timing chain issues, broken cam shaft, you name it but he and his crew went above and beyond to my car needs and worked with me on the price. I wish I worked closer still to take my car in but I cant :( My only rant to say is I wish you all were still open on Saturdays.</Review>

<Review>Orr Automotive kicks A**. The shop fixed my husbands Honda Civic in one day and boy did that car need some work. My husbands car needed brake fluid changed, oil changed, the radiator fluid changed, new tires, alignment and a tune up. I have brought my old car to them a horrible pt loser (cruiser) and that turned out to have electrical problems (got rid of that car). The car I have now is a Honda Crosstour it will be due for service soon so I will bring it to Orr Automotive. They're reliable and   trustworthy and WONT ROB YOU. They NEVER robbed me at all. Believe me I have searched for good and honest mechanics they all robbed and didn't fix anything, finding a good mechanic that actually lives up to its standards is rare. Finding this place was like a needle in the Hay Stack. They will always be the shop I go to.I don't care if I have to drive a long way they have my business till I die.

A++ service. My 2002 Mercedes c240 started overheating on Christmas eve, on my way to a friend's house, I did a quick search for auto repairs facilities near the area and Orr automotive was the closest one. Any way to make story short the shop was just about ready to close around 2 pm, guess it was a short day for them after all it was Christmas eve!. Turns out a had a defective coolant thermostat and a damaged radiator hose clamp!!. the guys stayed a little longer just to get the parts and fix my car. and they where happy to do it too, they got me back on the road in no time, my car is still running. and I might add, I have spend more in a single oil change for this same car at different mechanic shop's, then what  I spend that they on the repair. this guys knew what they where doing, and did it fast, and they are good people tooo!!!!.</text>

<Review>During this time of pandemic and with the changes both small and big , major or minor , one thing is for sure and that's we can not shape things the way they were before we got hunted by this predator covid-19 . The impact and magnitude of the permanent damages and the large number of human lost around the world is probably up there with in the categories of  Holocaust and the only difference is that the harm and the Mayhem was delivered by humans to other humans vs a airborne deadly bacteria that's equipped with Hemi and it's supercharged . My visit to nearby  Starbucks yesterday early morning made me think , it was very quiet in there I was the only one and things were not set up the way they usually were before , Starbucks was rocking and rolling before 6:00 a.m. with all the movements and activities from the local neighborhoods residents. I sure would like to see that scene again in Starbucks</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Masks required, as in all locations. Still, polite and prompt service, and they were even polite about asking for a face covering. They did not, however, allow my two-year-old to use the restroom. The fast-casual restaurant next door, however, did allow it no problem. Note to Starbucks: bathrooms can be perfectly safe with the right protocols from staff. Train the staff and keep 'em open! Otherwise, still great coffee and the most innovative coffee drinks this side of the universe.< /Text>< rate>

<Text>CONSISTENCY of DRINKS: 5 stars
MOBILE ORDER: 5 stars
PROXIMITY TO THE HOSPITAL: 5 stars

I have frequented studying or working at a Starbucks for probably 15 years. My best friend was also a manager of a Starbucks, so I have rather high standards of the drinks, service, etc. I went here 2x during a weekend for a conference and was happy that my drinks were 1. made well and 2. made on time.

If you are staying at the Laguna Hills Lodge. I was able to Mobile Order from my room and immediately walk over and my drinks were ready. They are also very close/on the way to the Memorialcare Saddleback Medical Center, which is a plus.< /Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dce8835f55a85b:0x4f2cb188ac70dc26<//Gmap_id></record>

Man. I was so hoping for that job (Not at starbucks, though, one day I would like to be a barista, could be fun). I had a nice calming cup of Chai Latte half hour before I need to show up around the corner.

Starbucks is nice.

I did one day of work, and was called back by my recruiter who was terribly confused saying they love my work but don't want me. Yeah, I'm a 6 foot tall amazonian brunette woman, trying to fit into a workplace of 5'5" svelt blonde women. They were sweet. But, the CEO had particular tastes.

And they say sexism is a thing of the past.<//Review>

<text>I was just cut in line by two people. 2:40 on 5/20/19. When I was standing there after the first person cut, the girl working the cash register didn't correct it or even look at me and let a couple cut. When I asked her, "did you notice I was next in line?" She said, "oh I wasn't paying attention." Clearly, my dear. The girl who made my drink rudely said "yeah" when I asked her to verify she yelled out misto. This staff needs a retaining in customer service.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<response>None< /response><pics>None</pics><Name>Scott Hornbeck< /Name><text>I have a love-hate relationship with this Starbucks. I am absolutely addicted to Starbucks.  I love their product. The people who come here are people from Laguna Woods who are obnoxious, loud, old and slow.  There's never a place to sit down because it has "Starbucks lice", those people who sit around the store all day long with their computers. Also, even if it's not crowded I step up to the register and get a blank look from the person behind the register as though employees are not trained or expected to engage me verbally. Just a blank look where I'm supposed to just bark out my order. That's not the way you do it. "Hi! What can I get started for you?"  Nope!  Nothing half the time!  Friendliness,  engagement, accuracy and speed even if there's one or a thousand in line.  This location doesn't get this right consistently.  People take ownership of the places they like and frequent and it saddens me when the closest Starbucks to me is this one. Product:5 stars.  Workers:3 stars.  Customers: 0 stars!< /text>< Date>

Asked for a water cup because they forgot to put it in with my coffee order and she turned her head rudely and said "NOT LIKE I HAVE A FULL DRINK ORDER"
Will never to back and will also ask my family and friends to avoid this establishment. There is a coffee shop down the road that has very friendly staff.

The PSL is something I look forward to every holiday season. Starbucks does a good job of debuting this early - online but unfortunately, even after 10 years, their stores manage to royally screw up this experience.

On their PSL specific Twitter account, people were given the opportunity to unlock a code, give the said code to a barista, and get their first PSL. Woohoo! You would think all stores would play along but alas it's always a hassle.

I work near 3 Starbucks locations. The first two I called weren't participating until the next day, the last one I called (this one) said, c'mon by, we'll make it for you with or without the code. Hooray!

I showed up literally 5 minutes later and no one knows what I'm talking about. PSL what? Really? How long have you been around? Do I really need to speak to a manager? Oh, that doesn't start 'til tomorrow. Ugh! I just called you!!

Finally, someone found an email explaining the whole thing, the code, etc. Seriously? Do you not keep up with what your corporate store is doing? Communication royally sucks.

I got my PSL but she did a crappy job of making it. The first PSL of the season is always crappy until they catch on. It's like amateur hour. They really could have been nicer about the whole thing and it would be nice if all stores played along instead of making us all look like fools running around with some mystery code.< /Text>

Love Grocery Outlet. You never know what you'll find. With that being the case, sometimes you can't get what you're specifically after; still a great place though going in knowing that. Cheap too!<//Text>

Shop here 1st! Save yourself a lot of money. I first shop here to get all I can cheap, then get all the items I couldn't get here at a full priced store. I usually avoid perishables, but the meat is good, and the fruits and vegetables are great. I found being choosy on expiration dates is wise.<//review>

This place is usually pretty clean and the staff is usually kind. There is one manager at night who is off putting and somewhat rude to the other staff. Also they say they are open till nine but ask people to make their final purchases at 8:30. They do have a pretty good selection and the shelves are always full. As far as pricing goes they are pretty average for a grocery outlet.<//Text>

Always a good deal, some products can be close to expiration so keep an eye out.

I like Grocery Outlet they have pretty much most of the stuff that I need. They're less busy than other stores. They do rotate some of their products so it's not always the same thing every time. But I do like their produce.<//review>

Worth and we are told that turkey we have is not the one they said, but Jen 00 is the brand. They say oh if it’s a frozen one same brand same size not fromFrozen. No frozen  left.

Great deals on some higher end products, but you have to pick and choose based on the expiration dates. Lots of stuff just about to expire here, some stuff already has. Not a good place to stock up as most of it has a very short shelf life. Hints the great deal.<//Review>

<Text>The stock rotates, so you can't rely on getting the same products from week to week, but there always some good deals to be had, so making a plan to stop in at least once per week is usually rewarding. The staff is friendly and comply with covid safety practices.< /Text>< user_name>

There was a gentleman by the name of Lucas who deserves a 5 star rating.  There are not May young people that was as kind, polite, and helpful and a hard worker.

This is what brings me to the Anderson grocery outlet is because of him.

The lady in front of me spoke with his manager and just shook her head.  When an employee has a 5 star rating or just a good repor from the public to the manager they should acknowledge that and at least give the customer something to write a good review

Thank you Lucas for setting a great example for the employees to follow and always have such a good positive at work.

I hope this lands on his file so they really know what a good employee he truly is< /text>

Place is becoming a staple in the stores to shop at.  Pretty good selection and some unique items too. Sometimes the bagged produce isn’t the best but always a good value and selection for a smaller store.< /Review>

<text>The only 2 times I've been there when I was next in line a relief checker came up and asked the people behind me to move to the checkstand she was opening. 2 different times, 2 different employees and neither of them thought to take the person who was truly next in line. Both times I had less than 4 items too where the customers they grabbed had full carts. Let's train your employees to not just grab the closest person but to look at the line and say to everyone "I can help the next person in line over on checkstand X". Or go around to the checker side and look and make eye contact to ask the person who was waiting the longest personally.<//text>< user_id>

I really like the daily emails I get every morning with their top deals of the day.  You can also enter into the drawing (monthly or weekly, not sure). To win a gift card for the amount you saved by shopping each time you shop there.</Review>

I'm going to give Grocery Outlet five stars all the way across because they always have some kind of good deal going they honor their Deals they give rain checks they have a decent produce section and the staff are always polite and one of the main things I really love about them is unlike Walmart they have mobility carts that actually work and are charged up for their elderly and disabled customers and that in itself is a major brownie point<//review>

< review>
They constantly discriminate against ebt card holders. Watched them smash not only my groceries whilst being stingy what is supposed to be free bags, bags that are paper and aren't even supposed to have a charge, but also smashed all of the groceries belonging to a sensior citizen paying with ebt. WILL be filing a discrimination lawsuit as well hiring a PI to investigate their store.</review>

Check out was bad, not many customers,  all lanes open, but cannot tell because Store too bright to see lane open light is on. Also, one lane as I try to get to it, cashier comes out in front of it and just starts jaw jacking with friends, like she had nothing to do. So I had to get in a line behind 3 others in a different lane, taking a good 5 minutes extra if my time. Then as she goes back to her register she glances and sees my two items are on the counter, so instead of asking me to come around to her register she goes and gets somebody else to check out. I only had 2 items, lady in front of me only 1, and our clerk was still checking out somebody else.<//review>

This store just opened in August, 2017.  It is a nice, clean store with discounted groceries and home items like cleaning and laundry supplies, beauty and over the counter medicine items, and fresh produce, meats, dairy and deli items.  They have new items every time I go in there.<//review>

Pleased to find good nuts and dried fruit. Poor lettuce selection. New clean store, keypads. Dave's and Franz breads. When GO has it it's cheaper.< /Review>

This is a nice store although it is much smaller than I anticipated.  The prices I saw were somewhat comparable to Wal Mart or WinCo.  Some items a little cheaper and some higher.  For what I normally buy this is not the store I would go to.  When I checked out today it was about $18 and she told me I saved $28.  I don't know what they were comparing it too but it was ridiculous.  Even Safeway would not have cost me $28 more and they are the highest store in town.  My grandson and wife like this store very much as they are trying the vegan route and said this store has a lot of items they buy.  Sorry I can't say more good about this store but I am sure there will be a lot of people who are very pleased with it.  I will go there occasionally but it will not be a regular stop.</Review>
