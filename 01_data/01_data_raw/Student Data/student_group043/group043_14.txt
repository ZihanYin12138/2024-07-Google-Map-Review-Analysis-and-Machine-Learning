< Review>
Called Republic Services on April 9th to schedule the first of two allotted bulk item removal, included in our service. The one and only appointment they had was in mid May, on a day that did not work for us. Asked for another day and was told the system could not schedule out any further.
Was told to call back in a week or so.
Must be nice to have a business monopoly. It goes to show that competition is a good thing.</Review>

I was third in line and it took an hour and a half. only one person can go inside at a time with their recycling. There is not enough bins placed outside to put your cans and plastics in so if you are not ready because they did not give you bins they just skip you which sucks. The guy was nice. That’s the only positive.<//text>

Recently moved to Fairfield. I was told by a representative that they would replace the dirty trash and recycle bin with refurbished ones. In addition to that phone call, I have called exactly 5 times for the same service. Despite being given several dates, with my garbage pick up day being the last resort, it has not happened yet. Very poor service.<//Review>

<Review>I’ve been on hold longer than it took to develop a vaccine for COVID-19. At least the national line picks up right away. This branch not so much. All I would like to do it set up services. You think they would want that money. You would also think with so many people willing to work right now the current staff here would take their jobs more seriously. Horrible first impression.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Literally the worst company in Fairfield. First, scattered my trash on the street, second, missed trash pick up, third, the customer service took 30 mins to pick up the phone and promised to pick up the trash the next day, but nobody picked up. Transferred me to the supervisor then got disconnected. Honestly, the customer service is unprofessional and rude. The company should start looking into the people working in Fairfield, CA and re-evaluate their people.<//text>

I wanted to have a question answered about where & how to dispose of something. I don't have internet at my house and my phone is too small for me to look things up. With that said, I called them. When I finally got through the automated system, it placed me on hold & and informed me that they were assisting other customers and would answer once available.

I understand that I need to be patient a bit and to wait my turn. I am certainly okay with that. What I have a problem with is waiting a half hour on hold and when someone actually answered, I was told that they had someone before me and that they would be right back. So, needless to say, I was placed on hold again.

That really doesn't even bother me.  I am upset by the fact that I was on hold for another 30 minutes before I just hung up. I don't know if anyone has had that same problem, but that's not okay. Especially when they can just raise the amount of charges without an explanation or providing a breakdown of all charges.

I pay my bill on time. When I  call in to have a question answered, I shouldn't have to wait an hour on hold.

I hope the phones are taken a bit more seriously and that this was a one-time event.</Review>

This company definitely needs to be under new management- their customer service is polite and they seem to want to resolve issues but the delivery of resolution to the issue doesn’t get resolved.  I’ve been trying to have them pick up a trash bin that is not needed and they just won’t collect it although they tell me it’ll be collected each time I ask.  It’s been cluttering up my area for 7months and I want it gone!<//Text>

<Review>Called to schedule a bulk pick up of rolled pieces of carpet. First available appointment was two weeks out. Disappointed the wait was so long but accepted the appointment, Repeating it twice to ensure I got it right. I neatly stacked my carpet the night before and guess what? .... no pick up! I called republic services following  morning, they had no record of my appointment. Nice. My new appointment is now another 3 weeks away! So I have to haul it all back behind my fence, and re haul it again. Very poor service, no explanation given and no attempt to make it right by having it picked up sooner.<//Review>< Pics>

I do not normally write or rate for Reviews but having dealt with  such a small concern, of a missed Recycle pick and I requested for a return  that was not Handled by Management in any way shape or form. A Supervisor never returned a call as stated. very unprofessional management. i repeatedly called everyday and got the same  results: in which they flat out did not do what they said. NEVER GOT WHAT WE PAY FOR.< /Review>

<Text>This place is run worse than a toddler's lemonade stand. They don't pick up when they are supposed to, and want to charge $200+ to have an "unscheduled" pick up done, though their employees are the ones who dropped the ball for the pick up. Republic Services: I get it that there are no other options, so you don't have to care about losing business, but at least make an attempt at being decent human beings.<//Text>< rate>

< Review>
I live in Suisun City and wants to drop off my CRV and e-waste. I called and was informed that they don't offer buy back of CRV on their Fairfield location for Suisun residents. It's 0nly for Fairfield residents. But I can drop off my e-waste there... Ironic!</Review>

<Text>In the 3-4 times I have contacted Republic Services, I received excellent customer focused services.
There were even suggestions offered to assist me in saving money on my bulk pick up requests.
When I requested a replacement garbage bin, it was delivered on my next pick up date as promised.  5 stars is all that is listed, but I would gladly give 10 stars.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80853e42743698f9:0x256b4d9ba779114e<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Ordered a 20 yard container online and the website said in 48 hours it would be delivered. After 2 days I call to ask where it is and they ask me if I talked to anyone. I said no and they told me I wasn't going to get a container until I talked to someone. Not what website says. To top it off I ordered a container through a representative and they promised it by Friday. It was actually promised by Thursday on website. After a "problem" with my paperwork and redo they promised Friday again. No container on Friday, called off work, lost money, No one cares, and I'll get my container on Monday. Too bad I work on monday and all my help went home! Maybe next weekend but they will prob remove it before then because the website is broken except for payments and do not know what they are doing or saying. Ridiculous!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< gmapID>

< Review>
Your street cleaner just sucked up my doormat.  I live in an alley and there should never be any reason why one of your cleaners should be that close to my front door.  My doormat was not cheap either.  I tried waving down the truck after it passed and had no response.  Needless to say i am not happy about this. If I was to open my front door I could could have very easily touched the truck.  NOT SAFE!  I know the alleys are narrow but there is plenty of room to avoid being that close.  The truck passed over a wad of paper and it stayed behind but off goes my mat!</Review>

I have called the local number three times and each time I was put on hold to speak to an agent and the wait is about an hour each time.  I am hating Republic services.  When I spoke to a general agent I could hear a bunch of people in the background laughing and monkeying around.  They are not working they are having fun while we are waiting on the phone for hours just to make a simple appointment for spring clean up.  I am disgusted.< /review>

I have been repeatedly informed that the delivery of my trash cans would be on Friday.... then next Friday...... then next Friday. I have been waiting almost four weeks for trash cans. I have been paying for a service that I cant utilize. The service is awful. I expressed my frustrations PROFESSIONALLY to the customer service rep and she couldn't have cared less. She was extremely inappropriate and condescending as if not have trash cans is a small problem. I wish there was another service in the Fairfield area.< /Text>

<Review>If I could give a negative 3 stars I would. This is the worse company in over 35 years of business that I have ever dealt with.  They can't even manage to return a phone call.  My office and I have been on the phone over 2 hours during at least 10 different occasions trying to get a dumpster.  They make a lot of promises. Never got a single call.<//Review><name>Ted Curley</name><Gmap_id>0x80853e42743698f9:0x256b4d9ba779114e< /Gmap_id>< time>

<Text>Isn't is true that when you owe them money they are out to get you however if you over pay them they dilly dally without a concern. My banks (Patelco FCU) online banking system changed and apparently I paid $4760.00 to Republic Services by accident on October 18, 2017. I was notified by my bank that I am over drawn. I went to the bank and asked for help. They said they could not help me. I called Republic Services that day and they said that I would see the money back in my account in 5 business days. It has been 8 business days and no money!!! Just got off the phone and they said corporate does not know when they can refund me my money! I can't believe this is happening but what can I expect coming from corporate???? My mortgage is due....I need HELP! Help!!!!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

The worst company I have ever had to deal with.  Overcharge and under-deliver.  Pick up 3/4 of the time.  Waited months to get a recycle bin. Over charged me, then removed some of the overcharge but charging late fees on the overcharge that was removed.  haven't picked up for 5 weeks but insist on charging me anyway.  What a joke of a company.  There really needs to be a choice.<//text>

This company is horrible. I've called them over 8 times to get my service stopped and trash cans picked up. After 3 months the trash cans were never picked up. After 5 months they are still charging me for service I don't even have anymore (sold the house).< /Review>

Dr Parks has been my dentist for years and I highly recommend his services. From crowns, bridges, fillings, cleaning- Dr Parks does an excellent job. His staff is so very friendly, knowledgeable and responds quickly to my calls, texts etc.  AND their prices are great as well.< /Text>

<Text>I recently had a deep cleaning because my gums were hella sad. Thanks to the staff and Dr. Park my gums are now happy once again. My teeth are super clean and bright. I’ve now had a wisdom tooth removed, a root canal, a crown and now a deep cleaning. I’ve had a wonderful experience with all the procedures. Cannot thank the staff and Dr. Park enough for all they’ve done :D<//Text>< pictures>

Dr. Park is by far the best dentist I've ever had. Not only was I able to eat and drink like normal after a couple of hours, he did all my dental work with a type of painless precision work you would expect. So happy to have Dr. Park for all my future dental services.</text>

Excellent Dentist. Best experience I've had in years. Everything was explained to me in detail using the X-rays to show me what concerned him. Good honest dentist with no up-selling. Will be going back again.</Text>

My family has been going to Dr. Park for years and have always appreciated his thorough and attentive service, in addition to the professionalism and friendliness of all of the office staff.  Recently went for a cleaning and fealt safe and comfortable that the practice is going above and beyond to meet all Covid safety protocols while continuing their dedication to the excellent customer service to which we've become accustomed.< /Text>

Dr Park, and everyone in his office, are helpful, caring and sincerely friendly. Dr Park is so gentle, it’s rare that I ever feel anything. I moved to their office a few years ago and will never go anywhere else.<//Review>

I’ve been coming here since I was a child. I’ve aways had a fear of the dentists because of the drilling gave me anxiety. Dr. Park is always considerate if something bothers you while operating and will pause and adjust his work for you to feel as comfortable as you can. He hums while he works to distract the sound of the drills and to calm you down, which is very effective. I highly recommend him to be your dentist :)<//Review>

The office was clean and well organized.  The front desk assistant Sasha is awesome.  She patiently took her time to explain everything I need for my specific case and was very professional.  Moreover, Dr. Park was very informative and provided by examples what needs to be done and why.  He too was very professional and took his time in explaining what was going on.  I am very happy I was referred to this dental office by a family member whom has been a member over 10 years and now I too have decided to join this Dental Office.  Anyone looking for a professional dentist, friendly smiles, clean office, and great customer service, please consider this office for all your dental needs.  Ms. JW< /review>

Dr. Park is amazing... he has a friendly approach, does not rush at all, and shows care for his patients. My husband and I are happy we found this office after several mishaps at other offices. It seems that the office is well organized with its patients that the wait time is very short or none at all. I highly recommend this dentist!</Text>< date>

We love Dr. Park and his staff. Every visit has been professional. When one of my children had a less than ideal exam Dr. Park expressed disappointment the way a Father would. It makes dental care so much easier when the Dentist and staff make you feel like family. I highly recommend Dr. Park.< /Review>

Very polite and helpful staff!  They are always positive and make you feel comfortable.  Dr. Park has done amazing work on a wide variety of different issues on my teeth. I have been to many different dentists over the years and Dr. Park is very gentle and informs you step by step through the procedures. Sasha is very helpful at providing different options for treatments and their corresponding payments.  I highly recommend Corona Family Denistry!</Review>

I've  been bringing my grandson to Dr. Park since he was a toddler. He walks in willingly and that helps me a lot. Dr Park is as gentle and understanding as can be with children. He and his staff are always kind and very helpful and you are seen in a timely manner. They go out of their way to accommodate you time wise. The waiting area is always clean and neat.< /text>

The worse experience ever. I went in to have a tooth extracted and the dentist Dr Park gave me a shot to deaden the area.
I told him I still have feeling after he poked around in my mouth.
He says to me “I’m pulling it anyway” So he did while kicked my legs in pain.
As he finished I walk out to the front desk no instructions were given to me only to ask “What credit card did I want to use”.
I’ve never been back this guy does not care for his patients.<//Review>

My initial experience with the front desk staff was friendly and fine. My daughter is 4, and has not had much experience with dentists as her teeth came in much later than normal. The hygienist was kind, took X-rays (that my daughter sat PERFECTLY through), and then led us into the room where her teeth were going to be cleaned. The hygienist then "cleaned" her teeth, which in reality was a half done polishing job, and left the room. The actual dentist, Dr. Park, came in. He didn't say a single word to myself or my daughter, did nothing to help her feel comfortable. My daughter was startled because he leaned her chair back without warning and she slipped. He then whispered to his assistant and walked out.
We were informed my daughter had some cavities. I wasn't told how bad the cavities were, the surface of teeth they extended to, or ANYTHING.
Apparently, slipping constitutes behavioral issues as this dentist decided he was not able to treat my daughter. Behavioral issues because he didn't warn her that her chair was going to fall back?
I am absolutely appalled at the service I received today at this office. The lack of positive reinforcement is what teaches children to fear the dentist, the lack of proper explanation leaves parents unable to understand what is truly happening, and the obvious lack of professionalism leaves me baffled that this office has high reviews.
I will not be returning here, or using either referral they gave me. My daughter does not have behavior issues. This is simply a dentist who has no care nor sympathy for children who have no idea what to expect.
Again I repeat, if you are a parent of a young child, I DO NOT RECOMMEND Dr. Park.<//text>< Pics>

The office itself is clean and orderly.   I do not hesitate in referring friends to Dr. Park.<//review><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

He was extremely rude and impatient with his patients i was getting my wisdom tooth removed and he was just raising his voice the whole time left me with my wisdom tooth half ways out pushed his stuff out the way and said i cant do this i have to send you to an oral surgeon i had to tell one of the staff that i was moving because it was hurting my nerve but for him to just walk out in the middle and leave my tooth half ways out and say  i cant do it go some where else with out knowing my nerve was hurting is very unprofessional and he left me in risk of getting an infection . he does not know how to treat his patients, when i was in my room waiting he was just raising his voice and being extremely rude to other patients as well.. I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE..< /review>

<Text>Had a very bad experience.
paid top dollars for cheap service.  old equipment,  Doctor had a short temper.  Had a crown done  and kept going back because it was never done right,  getting the run around.  Receptionist told me why don't you go back to your old dentist.< /Text></record>

I absolutely love this office! The staff is so amazingly friendly and understanding. My 2 sons (11 and 19) hate going to the dentist! But since we have been coming here, they no longer protest when they have to go! I highly recommend Dr Park to everyone!< /Text>

<review>I went here last year. They told me I had 3 cavities that needed to be filled. I went to a new dentist a year later, when insurance would next cover a cleaning/x-rays. This dentist did not see any cavities or issues in my mouth. I feel like people with medi-cal or dentical will struggle feeling like a valued client. I'm still searching for a dentist equal to the one I had before I moved to southern California. The cleaning here felt rushed. At least they give you a cheap free toothbrush. The staff were friendly, too, but the cavity fillings I needed, which I don't need, are why the 1 Star. If anyone finds a good dentist in the area that takes medi-cal, please let me know lol.< /review><user_name>Heather Knightson<//user_name><Rating>1</Rating><UserId.>107600864847402160018</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

This USC graduate is a great dentist and is gentle.
He has great staff that care.
I looked for a quality dentist and found him...
This office has affordable fees for good dental work.

<text>The Pupper Club do great work and I would highly recommend them! Their day excursions are great for the pups and it works wonders on helping them get rid of pent up energy. They take great photos during the excursions as well (Before grooming) and their grooming services are also fantastic.<//text>< pictures>

<review>I brought my boy Colin in for the first time last week and so glad I chose this place after the research I’ve done in the DTLA area! Not only does he look amazing, but the entire team is so wonderful, professional and communicative about the entire process. Highly recommend!<//review><time>1620318449438</time>< gmap_id>

Found this place online and went in for first groom yesterday. My dog Sacha is a pretty anxious little girl and I've always worried leaving her at the groomer. When I picked her up, she was playing and taking pics with the front desk girl and I couldn't believe how calm she looked! The groom looks amazing and so happy i've found this place. Will definitely be back!!</Review>

<review>I have worked with The Pupper Club for 6 months. I work hard as a physician and don't have much help at home so I feel so lucky to have found The Pupper Club. My dog, Albert, an energetic Beagle/Dachshund mix, is so happy and tired at the end of the long day. They offer a ton of services including overnight boarding, day care, hikes, grooming, photos to lighten up my day, pick-up and drop-off at reasonable prices. Eileen, the owner, is super-awesome, professional and provides feedback and tips. Her staff is great too. My pup and I have been so happy here. I give my highest recommendation without reservation.< /review>< Rating>

I needed a place to bring my maltese Mochi for a the day, since I had to be on the road for work. I called to make an appointment and found out that they also offered grooming - a plus! I had just flown from out of state and had her vaccinations and rabies info with me which was good - I could show them that she was ready to mingle! The shop was close enough for us to walk to from my building in DTLA (which sadly also gave us another good reason for her to need a groom). We were greeted by Eileen who was really sweet to Mochi and she gave us a quick tour of the facility. I did notice that the space despite having other friendly barking dogs, HAD NO DOGGIE SMELLS!!! I asked Eileen about it and she said they were really fastidious about cleaning - it shows! Despite being a little hesitant to be left behind, Mochi immediately started making friends and barely noticed I had left.

When I returned to pick Mochi up, I was pleasantly surprised to see how how bright white she was! And on top of it, she didn't actually want to leave and go home with me lol. Pricing for the daycare and grooming was reasonable and the hygiene cut she got was great. Will definitely be back! I've already recommended their service to neighbors in my building. A+<//Text>

They listen very patiently and take time to make sure our needs are met all the time! They are gentle and take such good care of my dog!
Today we had our pup groomed by Eileen and holy cow he looks handsome!
I cannot recommend this place enough!< /text>< pictures>

<Text>SO happy to have found this place! I have 2 one year old Pomeranians, and took them here for their first grooming just before Christmas. I wish I could remember the groomer's name -- he was amazing! I was so nervous about the puppies having their first trip to the groomers, but all of my fears were quickly alleviated once arriving at Pupper Club.< /Text>< Response>

I took my Shih-Poo, Elliott, in for bath/haircut/grooming/teeth cleaning.  Lucy was his groomer, and she did such a great job, giving great detail to his cut (yes, I notice!).   Even better, she was very sweet, and seemed to really care about Elliott. We will be returning to Healthy Spot, and recommend Lucy for all your grooming needs!<//text>

The people who work here are always so kind and friendly and helpful. They will take all the time in the world to answer questions and are generally very knowledgable. I get my dog groomed here as well and they do a fantastic job, they are quick and reasonably priced. Would give 10 stars if I could!< /Text>

<Text>I have been using Pupper Club for grooming for over a year now and the result is always amazing! My dog is a senior golden retriever and they take such good care of her, always making sure she's comfortable. They use 2 handlers to wash and dry her as it's hard for her to stand for long periods :( and always have her waiting in the front for me instead of crating! I always appreciate the extra care they take with her :)< /Text>< UserId.>

<Text>This is my number one dog salon even though I live in Hollywood and they are located DTLA that should say it all right there! I Go the Distance because they always accommodate my last-minute scheduling needs and have the friendliest staff who are so good with my two puppies I feel confident when I leave there that my babies are in the best care! They also do the hippest styling there with their colour-pop die jobs you can get your pups dyed any color where they have like fur and you want to accentuate those features! My mini Lhasa Apso gets pink bell-bottoms on her feet and my mini should sue gets a blue faux hawk and it is the show stopper they look so amazing every time and their prices are totally fair I love this place and make a day of downtown LA just to come here.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics></record>

<Review>I had a horrible experience with this place. I left my dog for boarding for a few days and when I got picked her up from it she was hurt. Because it was night and dark I only saw the wound when I arrived home. I saw she had blood around the fur in her eye which came from a scratch near her eye. The owner never let me know about that, which made me even more distressed that I left my dog in a place where they clearly did not pay attention to her. Also, her fur was full of knots that where so close to her skin and hurting her that I could barely touch the spots where they were (which were many). It was a traumatic experience for my dog, since I left her healthy and happy and got back a dog that was hurt and scared. I felt so bad for having left her there that I feel strongly about warning new customers. If you love you dog and want the best treatment for her, do not leave your dog here.</Review>< user>

DO NOT BRING YOUR PET HERE.

I picked my dog up yesterday to find a half inch open cut on her leg. No one notified me when I picked her up. The dog is 11 and has never had an issue with a groomer.

This is second to the owner cutting her hair so crooked that 3 months later it's still not long enough to even out. When I called the owner became super defensive and refused to acknowledge the 3 missing inches off my dogs right ear. This place is a wreck.<//Review>

Came to this location to check out the space available for birthday parties and was greeted with great customer service. There was a young lady at the front desk ( possibly names jessica, i hate that i cant remember) but she was awesome! She was supper informative and attentive. The reason i gave 4 starts is because unfortunately there daycare only takes little dogs which sucks, especially when you own 3 pitbulls. Besides this the store is very well kept and stocked. They have a couple parking spaces available, didnt have trouble parking. Will definitely be back to shop but decided not to continue with birthday party due to size.< /text>

I had Hank groomed here twice and the first time was close to perfection.  The second groom was a little rough but the staff has reached out to me and received my feedback.  They addressed my concern and I will definitely be giving them another try.  I really appreciated their prompt response to my concern and can't wait to bring Hank back in!  I hope to update this review and add a fifth star once the groom is complete.</Review>

Highest recommendations for the Pupper Club. The staff are very attentive and keep the areas clean. I have boarded my pup for trips and we do day care once a week. It is a happy home away from home for him. I have taken him to other day care where he seemed bored and lonely when I picked him up, but, at the Pupper Club, he plays during the day and seems happier. Great place.< /review>

Ashley is wonderful. She is always willing to go the extra mile for my pup, Honey - has even stayed late just to groom her with a last minute appointment. She is always responsive and takes her job extremely seriously. Most importantly, she truly cares about all the pups and loves what she does - which is extremely important when leaving your pup in someone else's hands. 5 stars all around for Ashley!<//review>

The Pupper club is a little hidden gem in downtown la. If you want doggie day care that’s Boutique, attentive, personalized and just like trusting your fur baby with friends or family, this is the right place for you.
I got hooked on Pupper club when I realized I needed a home-like environment where I felt comfortable leaving my Maltese Yorkie, Millie. She’s a super sensitive personality and so sweet but very timid. I took her to Pupper when they first opened and she literally fell in love with one of workers, Gabe, and I finally felt fine leaving her. Now when I pick her up, it’s like she’s at home... she actually walked me over to the food area the other week! I was crying laughter. Eileen the owner is also awesome- she’s there most of the time and very hands on- you can tell that dogs and daycare are her passion. I’m very happy with my care for Millie, and I’m not a big reviewer but wanted to share!<//Review>

Eileen and her team did a wonderful job of taking care of our two elderly pugs (9 & 11) when we went away and left them in their hands for over a week!

One of our pugs is semi-disabled and needs a little bit of extra care and I'm very happy to say, this was no problem at all to the enthusiastic and friendly team. Our pooches came home almost a little sad to have left their Pupper Club buddies.

Will definitely use again and recommend.<//Review>

New facility. I take my dog here twice a week for daycare. Also boarded him a couple of nights. No complaints. He's always happy and exhausted when I pick him up. Staff is friendly and the rates are better than other places in the area. Would highly recommend day care. Note that they only take small dogs.<//text>

Brought the dogs here for day care and grooming, they came back so clean, dapper, and most of all happy!

They even delivered the dogs to my place; talk about full service!

Much more of a boutique and personalized experience than other doggy daycares I've been to! I will definitely bring the dogs back here!</review>

<Review>The pupper club is my favorite doggie day care place! The staff is super friendly and the environment they have set up for dogs is wonderful. My dog has special needs and they were able to cater to him without a problem!
Will be returning!< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>Kuma & Uni (my shibas) love going to daycare here. Eileen does an amazing job with management and with keeping the dogs happy and comfortable. They also post updates on their social media so you can see your dogs throughout the day. They do a very good job with grooming too. Being in the veterinary medicine field, I see a lot of crazy scenarios from doggy daycares.... I wouldn’t trust my furbabies anywhere else. Thank you Pupper Club !!!< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>The pupper club is amazing! Fang and K9, our two rambunctious scotties, spend the afternoon in day care every Tuesday and Thursday.  We moved from a home with their own yard to a apartment downtown and I was really worried about their transition.  The pupper club has been a god send,  also we use fit pet, to walk them there and back, it's been a really good fit for our family.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1549039699933, 'text': 'Mercedes thanks so much for trusting us with your fur babies!

They truly are perfect little lap dogs :) Yesterday we lounged a lot!'}< /Response><text>We are so glad to have The Pupper Club in our neighborhood. We have two dogs, Maybel and Sleepy Pete. Maybel is 7 years old and generally dislikes doggy day cares, which are usually loud, dirty, and chaotic. Not pupper club! The floor coverings and furniture live up to even her high-class expectations, and they always have the right amount of pups in there. Sleepy Pete is a very shy 7 month old, and he always enjoys his time as well. The staff is communicative, professional, and very kind. This is honestly the best dog daycare that we’ve found. Thanks, Pupper Club!</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

I am sooooooo excited The Pupper Club Petit is open for business! Took my doggo in yesterday for a little bath time action and they FAR exceeded my expectations!!! My doggo got a facial, complete with drops in the eyes to avoid any burning/eye watering and then a good ole scrub a dub dub! Once he was all sudsy and rinsed, he got a nice blow dry and several applications of wonderfully smelling sprays to brighten his coat and freshen his scent... I had no idea doggo cologne existed! After all of this came a nice solid de-furmination!

My pup was so happy afterwards and got sooooo many compliments on his scent (he actually made my apartment smell more fresh!!) I also asked if they would file his nails, but Sam, the groomer, let me know that he didn't need it... no pressured up selling here! Just sincere people who really love dogs! I know where we'll be getting our baths from now on!

Any size dogs are welcome for grooming and if your fur-friend is 35 lbs or less, they have an amazing play park and a separate lounge!! If you have a dog and you love them as much as I love my little man, Arnold, you'll want to check this place out ASAP!!

Side note: the decor in this place is so stinking cute I can't stand it and all the staff are super duper friendly!!!<//text>

Excellent Mexican food! This may be the best reasonably priced food in town. Better than the place across the street, sorry. Everything thing was fresh and well seasoned.<//Text>

< Review>
Not only the best tacos in Lone Pine, and a new must eat when In town. These tacos rival any tacos I’ve ever had. The Asada and carnitas was incredible and the salsa is not for the weak!

Also, this tack truck is cash only, when I went to pay with a card he kindly let me know and without hesitation allowed me to take the tacos free of charge. Of course I couldn’t stomach that and went to the ATM across the street. Kindness does exist!<//Review>

<review>Stopped to grab lunch on our way back home from Lake Tahoe. I'm glad we stopped the tacos were delicious. I tried the asada and the adobada which is similar to al pastor, and carnitas. I did not like the Carnitas as much as the asada and adobado those were very good and the salsa's they give you are very tasty. The tacos are a good size. You won't be disappointed.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<text>Terrible! Terrible and expensive! $10 gets you a small carnitas burrito that is literally rice, beans and carnitas. Cheese? No. Onions? Cilantro? No. Pico? Salsa? Anything?!? Go fish.

Flavorless.

< Review>
I got a shrimp burrito and my husband got a carnitas burrito. Both very tasty. The carnitas were a little crispy but the shrimp was seasoned perfectly. And as a Hispanic person who regularly eats beans I can say that was some of the tastiest burrito bean I have had! There is a small seating area if you don't want to take it elsewhere.</Review>

Came here everyday for lunch AND dinner during our stay in Lone Pine. Best tacos I’ve had since Mexico! Get the carnitas and cachete. Lovely people as well, they remembered that we came every day and gave us a heads up on when they would be closed. Love this place!!!< /text>

I stopped here Friday evening for a burrito and it was bomb! I thought I would be able to eat and drive but the burrito was definitely a 2 hander, and really really good and hot.
I'm from southern California where there is a lot of taco spots this is one of the better burritos I've had.
I work in Bishop so this will probably be my spot on the way home every week.
They are opening a brick and mortar location and I can't wait.< /text>

<Review>If you're anywhere near Lone Pine, you need to eat here!

THE best carnitas tacos I've ever had, and I take them very seriously.

Came three times in one week for lunch, tried all the tacos (except chicken neck that they ran out of), Carnitas and Fish were especially fantastic.

Service is friendly, food is fresh, and prices are good.< /Review>< pictures>

<Rating>4< /Rating><review>$2 per taco is a steal in comparison to what we got. The meat was fresh off the grill and so tender and juicy. The truck has a salsa section to add toppings to your tacos, along with sodas and other drinks. Nice seating area outside. Only issue was communication with the ladies in the truck, but that was fine.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>My friends and I were hungry and most of the restaurants in town closed at 9pm. We drove down  to get some gas and spotted this food truck tucked away a bit. The food was quite good and they were even willing to accommodate vegetarians, even though they don't have any vegetarian options on the menu.<//Review>< rating>

Awesome Tacos. Thank you so much for making me tacos tonight after you were closing. The Asada Tacos and Red Salsa were AMAZING. I have a 2 hour drive ahead and these tacos were really what I needed to keep on going late into the night. Godspeed.<//Text>

I had the beef burrito. The portion was huge, which is always good.
I would probably recommend the tacos instead.< /Text>

Amazing reviews, amazing tacos, plenty of photos on Yelp.

I'm from SoCal and I have to say this place is on my Top 3 list! Delicious, fresh, inexpensive, amazing!

Their salsas & hot sauces are amazing. They have red, green, mild, hot, everything!<//review>< Pictures>

Agree with others. Really awesome tacos. It was freezing night when we went there. Started with carnitas, asada and fish tacos. Super yum. Ended up lordering lot more and eating like a pig. Service was excellent. Definitely a place worth going to.</Text>

Delicious fish and shrimp taco, fried pork burrito was awesome! Found this place on Yelp before my JMT hike, I had to come back again after I finished my hike. I think my appetite scared the owner lady. :)< /text>

<Review>Tacos here are great. Asadas and Carnitas are what we ordered and we were Not disappointed. They use full size corn tortillas, which is rare from a taco truck and slightly brown the tortillas which . Will do this again.< /Review>< Response>

< Review>
we were visiting from los angeles. We were a bit skeptical to try this. Once we did we LOVED IT!!! THE TACOS WERE DELISH!! They are giant and full of meat!! The tortillas for the taco are crisped up a bit but it is good!! They are 2.00 each though but it is worth it for how much you get!! Definitely recommend carnitas and asada first and its worth a stop along hwy 395 to pick some up!!! Im seriously going to miss this place going back to the city.< /Review>

Real talk: get the tacos. The steak is great, carnitas ok. I got a steak taco and carnitas burrito, and it was too much. That burrito is BIG. nice crust on it, but too much beans n rice got a little overwhelming.</Review>

One of the few Turkish bakeries around OC/LA. I tried acma, pogca, simit, kadayif, ay coregi and everything tasted pretty good. Almost as good as the ones in Turkey. They don't have a lot of drink options.<//text>

I usually do not ask for the price of the items since I already know how much I used to pay before. After I was done with my purchase today, I asked for the receipt and I realized that most of the items were way overpriced. I will never ever buy from them anymore.< /text>< Pictures>

From Acma, to simit everything is very tasty and extremely fresh. Lately they started making "Pide" and they remind me so much of home. Definitely try the Sucuk version or the ground beef.

Made a mistake of not asking about the price of a cake when ordered. Was surprised to find out it's $275 when picked up, and that was for only 25 ppl. Negotiated down to $150 which was still high, but didn't want to get stuck without a cake for the event.< /Review>

The pork Ramen with the Miso soup is AMAZING! The service is great, very fast. 10/15 Mins for take out, very nice people. Haven't eaten in yet but the place looks nice and clean.</Review>

We were group of 5 ( half hour ago.). We are from Canada and we drove  40 km to visit Gulluoglu. We told her so. We ask for tea she said no tea than she said yes she will serve. We were watching her she took old cold tea to microwave to serve us. We were shocked, unbelievable we stopped her. After begging her for tea she decided to make it
She used same old cold water to do cold tea and served us
Nobody drink, we order few pastries. She charge us for all. Now we are at Starbucks across to enjoy what we missed is "smile and service". I never regret something like this. It was such a waste of time<//review>

I love this little pastry shop catering to the tastes of Turkish, Armenian, Persian residents of the valley. The ladies are always welcoming, the food brings me back to ny home country, the tea is always fresh and delicious and the su böreği is amazing. Whenever I'm in the neighborhood, I make sure to stop by.<//review>

(Translated by Google) He was very happy to come on vacation from Canada and hear Gulluoglu in Los Angeles. Although we were about 50 km north of the city center, we went, but when we left, we got stuck. The image of baklava was not nice. (stale) I added chicken gogsu, my wife, we wanted to eat sutlac with my friend. We wish we didn't eat. Our Migd was very bad. They even sent us to other side neighbors for our toilet needs. I don't know the people, but these are our experiences and prolongers.

(Original)
Kanada dan tatile gelipte Los Angeles te Gulluoglu nu duyunca cok sevinmistik. Sehir merkezinden 50 km kadar kuzeyde olmasina ragmen gittik,fakat gidince sok olduk. Baklavanin  goruntusu hos degildi. (bayatti) Ben tavuk gogsu, esim ekler, arkadasimda sutlac yemek istedik. Keske yemeseydik. Migdemiz cok kotu oldu. Tuvalet ihtiyacimiz icin bile bizleri baska yan komsularina gonderdiler. Sahislari tanimiyorum ama bunlar bizim yasadiklarimiz ve uzucu.</text>

Some good routes, not too crowded  and very short drive. Good climb only until noon since it is too hot after. Ideal time is 8 to 12:30.</Text>

Mission Trails Regional Park is a beautiful and tranquil place to hike, mountain bike, enjoy trail running and so much more. Once you are down into the park near the river bed the sounds of the outside world fade away. There are trails available for every fitness level. Well mannered dogs on leashes are welcome.</Review>

This place has everything for walkers runners, bikers and climbers. If you are just looking to get lost in nature and learn while you are at it, the trails have interesting learning facts strategically  placed for viewing.   There is also a unicorn of a waterfall that flows for a few days after a heavy rain then  magically😉 disappears again.</text>

Classic climbing in San Diego.  A.k.a. "the grunge" one can expect to find footwork difficult to get at first.  But if you can learn to smear at rhe gorge, then your gonna be able to smear anywhere.  I recommend doing Suzies Wild Ride, Hangmans Climb, Escapade, Quantum Leap, Dark Rider and General Dynamics.  For those looking for a real challenge there is the Thumb, I wish you luck on that beast!< /Review>

<Text>Professional work as always personally I've been going to Andres for years but any of the gentleman that work there are quite the gentleman. If you're looking for a up to date stylish haircut that they take pride in and are all Barber trained and certified when you found the right place. You have to not mind spending $30 for a haircut don't forget dropping a tip as well they do straight razor beard shaves for around 10 bucks but I've never gone for that.  Great place as long as I'm living in Santa Rosa I'll be going there for my hair..< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I'm a college student visiting the bay area, and decided to get my hair cut here after months of camping and backpacking. Randy probably gave me the best haircut of my life. Randy knows how to cut hair into modern, fashionable styles. His attention to detail is immaculate. Outstanding!</text>

<text>I’m very, very satisfied with my haircut. I had gotten a haircut at a different location and they completely messed up my hair, didn’t think it would be fixable unless if I shaved my entire hair off! My man Charles was up for a challenge and he made it happened! His knowledge and skills impressed me a lot! Best haircut I’ve ever had in my entire life, not exaggerating! Respectful and professional! If you need anything go to my guy Charles , you won’t be disappointed at all!<//text><Time>1524349981711</Time><rate>5</rate>< Pictures>

Rather than going down to the mall and just getting a quick cut I decided I to look online for a more high end and near by place. I found it here. Right in the center of town. Relatively busy so best to book and appointment, but I didn't and I still got in within a reasonable time frame. Rick, the guy who cut my hair, did a great job and cut my hair perfectly. He styled it, made sure there was no hair on me with a massage/vibration device that felt quite nice. This is my new spot to go to. I'll always go back<//text>

<Resp>None< /Resp><review>I've shaved my head for 12 years. Thought I'd grow it out and get a fade. My friend Erik recommended Armando C. at the Gentlemen's Parlor. I've been twice now and plan to go back regularly. His work is amazing. The atmosphere and music is to my liking. I'm not a fan of change so this was a big one for me. Armando makes it simple and enjoyable every time. Thanks Armando! See you in 4 weeks.

This is a great shop to go to for men's haircuts. It's clean and there up on all the latest men's trends. Pro Tip: make a reservation because this place gets busy (which is a good sign). I'm usually in and out within 30 minutes.</review>

I've been going to the Gentlemen's Parlor for about 4 months now, and Charles is my go-to (though all the guys are great). Hands down, Charles is the best barber I've ever had, and the place is busy yet clean and orderly. Whether it's a cut and/or shave, this should be your new stop!<//Review>

I’ve been here before but this time it wasn’t so great, i’m assuming he was new barber. He himself knows how to fade my hair but he didn’t really get what I wanted I asked for a short trim on top and bald fade on the sides but he ended up cutting more off from the top than I asked. He didn’t let me look at my hair at all when he was cutting it so it felt like I was in the dark.< /review>

The worst barbershop in town. They will let you wait an hour before telling you that they're only seeing appointments for the rest of the day, and they take forever to actually cut your hair. Don't bother coming here if you're trying to accomplish anything else that day. And they definitely cost more than $7, more like $20.<//Text>

I don't usually write reviews about restaurants I frequent, but I had to say something about this place. I have to say the decor made me feel as if I was in the Mediterranean somewhere. The service was on task and very   nice. The food was so authentic, portions were generous and extremely tasty. I can't say enough about my experience. I live an hour and half away, but I'll put this in my favorites. Give it a try you won't be disappointed.<//Review>

We like the Mediterranean decor, but the furniture is a bit plain. The food is very good. We like the casablanca pizza but it is no longer on the menu. The hummus is very good and comes with good pita bread. We also enjoyed their penne pasta. They have good fried cauliflower. They have a Greek burger and a cheese burger. We got the very good cheese burger with bacon and fries. They have very good zatar bread. Mandaloun is one of our favorite Mediterranean restaurants. We go there once in a while.</review>

<text>I am an out of towner... so take that in to concideration. I thought the atmosphere here was cool. The food was good too. We had a VERY large crowd and preordered our entrees. It made things tricky for the wait staff. They brought out random dishes and called out the name of the person who ordered the dish. Because noise echo and our group was loud, it was hard to hear and I am pretty sure dishes got mixex. I think there is a lesson here for the staff at Mandaloun (e.g. get the name of the person with the drink order. That way dishes can be passed out more seamlessly)... but with that said, i had a good time. I would try it again (with a smaller group)<//text>< Pictures>

I walked in almost at closing time, but the owner was very kind to allowed us to get a table, I was very happy, the food was delicious, the sangria and dessert out of the world, but the best part was a private party with live music and dancing, I fell in love with Arabians after that.</text>

Where do I start !! The cemetery is a very nice resting place to bury your loved ones it I’ve notice that  over the years it has not been maintained like it use to be.we buried my mother June 12,2020 .3 months ago we picked out my mother’s head stone and we’re told we would be emailed to have the final authorization done to proceed w/ getting it done before my moms 1 year anniversary of death may 21,2021 . Well we just received the final email to have it engraved not only is my family livid we are very disappointed that our mom will not have her head stone on her 1 year because the ball was dropped .her services were paid for and this is not what we expected we were told it would be another 6 weeks to process and we’re not not given a apology or have not received her death certificates .</text>

<Text>I have seven family members buried there.  I travel from out of state yearly to visit the graves. The grounds are no longer maintained.  The markers were a disgrace.  The staff was less than helpful.  I could not locate my grandmother's grave and when I  went to the office and gave them her name I was told they had no record of her being buried there.  After a very upsetting run around they finally located her grave.  Talk about a negative experience this was it.<//Text>< userid>

He saved for over a year to pay for this headstone and as a surprise to me got my father a new vase cause over 30 years of being there it was broken and in bad shape. So on April 7,2021 we went up with cash in hand and paid in full for a headstone and a flower vase. We where told the headstone would take 2-3 weeks to get a proof and about a week to get flower vase. After two weeks and the vase not being installed and no proof about headstone we called and no call back. So we waited two more days and went up to office  and talked to the counselor we worked with she insured me the vase was in (we didn't stop at grave site before going to office) and headstone proof will be coming soon she would call on it.  On way out we stopped at father grave no flower vase contact by email and got email back next day stating the vase will be installed that day May 4. May 8 I contacted her by email and told them once again the vase has not been installed. Got nothing back. Two weeks later was contacted by phone and she told us the vase was installed the work order was made for April 22. We went out to cemetery and called her back and told her no vase. We waited for awhile to see if she would call back instead she pulled up on golf cart. We showed her the graves and at that time she informed us she made a mistake and put the vases on someone else grave. And that we would have all this fixed that day cause she was going on vacation. Here I am 11 days from two months and no flower vase and no time line on headstone and no calls or emails back. I understand they have alot going on but come on now. I just want a refund and take my business else where for the headstone and fix the flower vase myself. Not good buiness especially for the price u pay for things.</text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

These people are not trustworthy. Don't listen to them, instead read your contract. They tell you something and in the contract put something else and during the funeral, have you sign other papers without telling you what and bingo, a new bill. Even if it is for a few dollars, they threaten to send you to collection even after you have paid them already more than ten thousand dollars. Don't ignore all the negative reviews.
Beware.< /review>

Full of it. Tried to charge my family $600 to see their husband/dad for 10 min...After they paid the almost $20, 000 funeral balance in full. They have yet to receive a the death certificate (from 1/21). It's May.  It does NOT take that long. I process these daily and it does NOT take 3+months to process a death certificate. Incompetent is an understatement.</review>

This Mortuary staff is by far the most unprofessional group of people I have ever dealt with. Speaking as a licensed agent who works with burial insurance and from a consumer standpoint. I almost held my own mothers service here. Unbelievable. Please do yourself a favor and find a funeral home that treats you and your family with the utmost dignity and respect during your time of loss. The entire staff, including the reps answering your phones need to be trained on empathy and customer service skills.< /text>

Please I can’t over state this, do not use this place as final resting place for a loved one. They are extremely unprofessional and rude. My father had already made his contract with one of their sales representatives prior to passing and we had to go with them. They stated one thing and did another, when we question it, they are extremely rude, some of their staff even responded with “ we are busy all we want to do is bury one and move to the next as quick as we can, so no accommodation are being done” and walked away. Please use someone else. The area where my dad purchased his plot is dry and dead and they won’t even allow us to try to maintain it .< /Text>

I was not satisfied with the quality of service from Montecito. They did not show the utmost respect to my loved one or our family. They made our loss alot more painful. They postponed our loved ones service date because they did not get to the coroner in a timely manner. They admitted they messed up and gave us some money back, but at that point it wasn't about the money! Just not the professional I would expect. Very disappointed!!!</Text>

The lady Karla who I am working with sent me the same proof two different times and then when she finally sends me the 3rd proof it was still incorrect. When I told her it was still incorrect and I feel that it's taking too long she informed me that she doesn't "design" the headstone. I understand that she doesn't design the headstone but she is the middle man and before even sending me the proof I think she should checking to make sure it is what I have requested. It's so frustrating that  my family go to visit his gravesite and they have to see a little green tag instead of his headstone that was paid for months in advance.</text>< Pictures>

You would think that you would get excellent treatment with arranging the funeral of a love you. The mortuary/cemetery funeral home directors are not suited for theeir positions.  They were clueless each time I called to arrange the funeral of my mother. My mother had Dignity life insurance and when arranging the funeral these people would not remember that we had prepaid arrangements. They did not return calls or return emails, as promised.  To this day, I  still dont have an email from the cemetery side regarding my mother's headstone.  I asked them to confirm the funeral time schedule.  Then we arrive and we were told a different time. Thank God we flew in a day early. Then the women I had been dealing with on the phone/email didn't even come out to talk with us. They sent some other person. This was the worst experience of my life.<//Review>

We buried my stepfather here on October 2020 and they have not put a headstone yet and have not put the grass either. It’s very sad to go visit him and only see dirt. Even after so many times that we have reported it and asked for them to take care of it they actually had the nerve to tell us that they have been busy and burying the other bodies was their priority. I guess there will only be patches of dirt everywhere since all they care about is burying as much as they can only to collect all the money they can get. Ps Most people we have talked to say they have put the grass themselves and I guess we will too only because my stepdad deserves a beautiful burial. I hope this gets someone to look somewhere else to burry their loved one.<//review></record>

My father passed away on 9/8/2020.  We had the pleasure of working with Karla, Virginia, Lake and John.   All the Montecito staff were very professional and compassionate.  It was easy to communicate about my dad's services from selecting the appropriate package all the way to the day of my dad's funeral.  Everything was well planned and we were given the opportunity to ask questions throughout the process at any time.  Karla took us out on a tour to see the plot and location of burial.  Everything was clearly explained.   The day of the services, we met Lake and John.   Lake was very friendly and easy to talk to.  She was very sympathetic and took the time to talk to us during the ceremony.   I was very thankful for the sincerity and understanding we were given by Lake.  I was very appreciative of our conversations and her friendliness, it made my day go so much smoother.
John was also very thorough and very friendly to work with.  He explained the process to all the pall bearers and the burial services.  We were very lucky with the staff that worked with us.  On behalf of my family,  I would like to thank Montecito for the services provided.  Everything was well organized and  made a very difficult day much more bearable.   We already started pre-planning for my mom's services and plan on returning for future planning of our family as well.  I greatly recommend Montecito Memorial Park and Mortuary.  The scenery is also very calming and peaceful.  Thank-you to all the Montecito staff who helped us get through a very difficult time.</Text>

<Text>Used Montecito Mortuary services for my mother’s funeral... won’t be recommending them to anyone in the near future.
The hearse was late to the service...we had to call to find out where they were. Our service started at 10:30am, they showed up around 10:15am.  Which also meant the guest book was put out late because it came with the drivers of the hearse, so our guests had to sign the book on the way OUT of the services.
The slide show provided by Montecito had the computer tool bar showing at the bottom of the screen thru some of it which appeared unprofessional like we made it at home on our own computer instead of having paid good money for it. At the cemetery, they put one of the wreaths the wrong way so you couldn’t read the banner properly. But the most heartbreaking part of it all.. they didn’t even style my mother’s hair even though my Father PAID for it in the pre paid arrangement package (& a picture was sent to the mortuary to show how she normally wore it!). Montecito.. although to You we may only be dollar signs, WE are real live families you are dealing with, and these are some of our darkest and saddest hours of our lives...a day in our lives we will remember for the rest of our lives...a day we will NEVER forget..you would think your company and representatives would act in a more professional and caring manner.</Text></record>

Despite the current circumstances with covid19 she was able to make it very special for us and for that we will always be Thankful and full of gratitude. Thank you Sandra for guiding us and helping us along the way. Joe had a beautiful farewell and I know he appreciates everything you were able to do for us.

My mother passed in September. She always wanted to be buried at Montecito, since that’s where her grandparents are buried. If she had known the stress that this facility would put on her family after her death, I’m sure that she would’ve chosen a different funeral home.

Their staff is unprofessional and disorganized. They seem to have it together up until the point that you pay for services. Then their staff becomes unresponsive, rude, and incompetent. I cannot stress enough how unprofessional their staff is. Here are examples of a few (of many!) bad interactions with their staff.

We had a staff member complain about my sister, not knowing that she was in the next room and could hear him.

We had the funeral home call us less than a week prior to my moms funeral claiming that they didn’t receive the casket we shipped them. They were extremely upset and claimed that it was probably too late to order another one in time for the funeral. We had ordered the casket two weeks prior. We asked them if they could check again to ensure that it wasn’t there. They refused to check again and ensured us that they didn’t have it. We contacted the casket company and got confirmation that it was delivered. The next morning, we called Montecito and insisted that they check again. They looked, and the casket was, in fact, at their facility. Very stressful night for us, on top of a very stressful time. All because they couldn’t be bothered to check again to see if the casket was there.

It has been two months since my mom passed away. We paid Montecito for the death certificates. We have not received them, which is needed for life insurance processing. We have called and been assured that “they are processing, COVID is just slowing the courthouse down. Don’t call back, we will call when they come in”. Finally today we call and the lady again tries to brush us off. It’s been two months. We know someone that passed a few weeks ago and their family already got their death certificate. We were adamant to have her check the status of our certificates... only to find out that Montecito never submitted the paperwork to the court. Their response was very flippant, and not at all apologetic. When we reminded Amanda that the burial/funeral was nearly $20,000 and we needed the death certificate for the life insurance, she replied “I don’t know where you got $20,000 from, our records show $8,000.” Great records, Montecito, and even better customer service.

Honestly, I could go on. But these examples certainly give insight as to the company that you’ll have to deal with if your loved one dies. Please, consider using another funeral home. I wouldn’t recommend them to anyone.<//text>

<Review>From the picking out the spot to the paper work to the burial to the aftermath, This place has given us nothing but problems on problems. The workers that we have worked with have been very unprofessional and rude. Our service was on Monday and by Tuesday everything was gone, while other spaces here have flowers from days if not weeks ago. They requested pay way before the burial, they have yet to give us our flower cups and they threw away our holiday decorations way before the actual day. They are unprofessional, rude, and disrespectful.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

The staff is extremely rude, they have no respect for the graves. They are so unprofessional. I went into the office to speak to management about maintenance ruining our stuff at our loved one’s gravesite and she only gave me an attitude and was absolutely no help. I don’t recommend this cemetery at all they have no interest in making their customers satisfied.< /text>

This was the first time experiencing Monticito's services, and they came highly recommended.  The staff I encountered on the phone were kind and friendly, and the staff representatives were equally so.  Lauri was the person I dealt with most of the time, and she couldn't have been more sympathetic or thoughtful.  it was not an easy process to arrange for our son's cremation, but Lauri made it so much easier, informing me of the current status of each step on the way.  I highly recommend Monticito Memorial Park to anyone facing the death of a loved one.< /review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I chose Montecito because I had attended a going home service there for another family member and felt it to be nice, well kept and peaceful. Hidden away in a nice location. Much more than I expected. Everything went very smoothly. Lauri and Anthony were so attentive and never to hard to talk too or contact. Everyone very pleasant and just a good vibe in working with everyone. The package we chose for our son was so beautiful and well put together everything I could possibly think of was included. I would definitely recommend Montecito Memorial. They took care of everything and I was very pleased with the outcome. Thank you so much Montecito for your unfailing attention to our needs and helping us get through this very tragic time in our lives.

My dad’s services turned out better than I had expected. The only thing I would suggest is they give you a checklist of what needs to be done and turned in, after losing a loved one your mind can be foggy.<//Text>< Pics>

We went to place flowers on my mothers grave today and they were closed! There was a sign out front that said they were closed due to Covid precautions. Their security guard wasn't even wearing the required mask when he threatened us with trespassing. Hillside Memorial was not closed.

Its really sad that the landscapers that mow the law are so lazy that they cant get off the lawnmowers to remove the old dead flowers and just mow around the  dead flowers. Isnt that part of their job to throw flowers away weekly? So sad how how families have to bring their weed eaters to do this themselves when I'm pretty sure this is part of the workers job description.< /Review>

As a Mortician of 30 plus years, I can not believe how poorly my family was treated. My Family spent many thousands of dollars on a Pedestal,  Stephanie was very unprofessional as to after you pay she forgets about everything, she does not follow up on anything at all,  the engraving, the damaged base of the pedestal, I spoke to her about this and no call back or anything. I had to contact the Manager Kelly, she was nice and got the Engraving done in time. I also spoke to her about the damaged base, still not fixed. all she cared about was the money. SCI should do a better job,  then at my Fathers funeral they had some unshaved slob that did not even speak to us, Stephanie was not even at the Grave side, the ones that take your money should be there to make sure everything is ok. most people have no idea that SCI owns most of the Cemeteries and Mortuaries, so if you get Treated bad it may be an SCI mortuary.<//review>

<Text>Montecito is stunning beautiful and well kept.  I been coming here since I was a young kid to visit my family members. Since 1976 Montecito has been our place to put to rest our love ones.  My dad got sick so we purchase land Deanna was wonderful pleasant and kind.  When he died a few days later I had to make final arrangements. Deciding and making arrangements were made quickly with no pressure from the staff. I thought wow this is great, they are going to take care of my dad.   I am on my way to dads memorial service,  I get a call stating his oil paintingPortrait did not arrive.  they said they are sorry but it’s not their fault. I was so upset I had to pick  up a cheap frame and put a picture in it. I only  had 5x7. Next thing the sheet where the urn sits was wrinkled. Come on guys!  I had five  flower deliveries from family.  Only one was in the chapel. Please be careful Monceito has two addresses. So the flowers went to the wrong location however they were on Monceito property. When my in-laws called the manager he said that’s not their fault. Ok here’s a tip if there’s a delivery find out where it goes and take it there! Four arrangements were not in the chapel because when they made it to my location the service had already begun!  My three concerns were major and heart breaking to a daughter grieving.  Please check on everything don’t assume it’s all being taken of.  The services were on a Friday, I send a email Friday night because I was upset. On Monday the manager called she was wonderful and understood.  I needed to be heard. I am leaving this review to help other families ask the right questions.  Please check and make make sure everything is done, please don’t assume. I made a mistake by trusting others.  It’s a beautiful place. I am updating my review my mother passed away on Monday, 6 1/2 months after my dad. I been working with Ernie and he is wonderful. I told the team that I was concerned by my last experience with them. He ensure me he will be in touch and keep me updated and check on the photo and the other stuff as well.  Osbelia is very kind and nice as well. I will keep you posted as the date gets closer. As of now I feel confident the services will be celebration of my moms life. I added a star hopefully after Saturday’s I can give them 5 stars.  Today once again their team came though for me and my family they manage to put my step dad and mom together in the candle light video. I lost both of them this year, this made me happy and smile . Thank you Ernie and your team! Today my mom services were perfect! Thank you !Please thank your team again. I would recommend your service to my family and friends.  Unfortunately I had to deal with Monceito again September 2020, I lost my brother. They did a wonderful job with my  mom.  I lost my brother, and now my sister in law is getting the run around.  We are really hurt he is without his marker, it been paid for since Sep. But it’s so hard to get in touch with anybody.  The follow though is horrible.  So two bad experiences out of three .  I am very disappointed and hurt. I change my review to 1 star for one job done correctly .update - March 12 still no marker . I will keep my review updated .<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<review>My mother prepaid much of her burial expenses.  What she did not rearrange was the flowers, coffin, body handling and the actual service.  The office staff was very helpful, HOWEVER (and this is a BIG however) the pastor that was provided ruined the entire service.

This pastor called me in advance and we discussed what I would like said and the facts and particulars of my mother's life and personality at length.  He then told me that he would write up what he would say and meet me and my siblings an hour before the service to go over what he was going to say.  After our conversation I felt comfortable that there was no need to ask anyone else to speak.  He was also texted additional information about my mother's career.  Instead of meeting us as agreed he showed up 10 minutes before the service saying he was stuck in traffic and told us not to worry. Imagine how disappointing it was when he said nothing that we had discussed and his generic description did not fit my mother AT ALL!  He obviously had not prepared and actually picked up his cell phone during the service as if he were going to read from the text at that time!

There is no second chance with a funeral and my mother deserved so much better.  This man's lack of professionalism or concern is inexcusable!</review>< Response>

Highly recommend for good service, caring staff, and gorguse scenery.< /Review>< pictures>

<review>treated our Fire Chief like dirt while going through the burial of his mother. I can vouch for this person spending multiple days of his life defending the homes from fire in the hills near and in Colton, CA. To be treated like he was is shameful. If fire is ever approaching your business, You all have nothing to worry about. We have something you don't. Integrity, Sense of Duty and Honor. There is somethings we can't control though, like Karma.<//review>< Pics>

<review>We didnt take into consideration that there gates for visitors is only from 8am to 6pm which is hard for me to accept. I'd like to go visit my father at any time of the day or night. It feels like I have to sneak in if it's before or passed 6pm just to go sit with my wonderful father. It's a major dissapointment personally.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Name>Jose Dorado</Name></record></dataset><record>

< review>
It's a desert town in southern Cali, don't expect the neighbors to be normal, just don't walk around at night. The hotel manager was very accommodating, and the rooms are spacious and comfortable for what they are. If you want a cheap rate and a decent place to stay, with a view of your vehicle, as well as friendly staff to work with, this is a good place to stay.<//review>

I wouldn't even put food on any surface. Sink just spews out water loudly. Wouldn't provide a military discount or anything. The door was difficult to close from the outside. We only stayed for the night because my mother was too sick to go further.

Front desk was rude to my disabled veteran mother who was sick last night when she asked for a refund and to top it off it was Mother's Day. He threatened us with problems if he sees a review after giving $10 discount in cash for a credit card purchase.<//Text><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

I need an laundry done, and they volunteer to do it for me. And did a great job. I meet some of the people staying here, and they all are like one big family that keeps coming back here when ever they are back in town. And with Red Roof Inn rewards it makes it even better.

<Review>The customer service was terrible. Grouchy guy up front didn't make it welcoming, both mattresses in the room were broken, a few big dead cocroaches decorated the room, they didn't provide us with clean towels the 2nd night, the sound on the TV was cutting in and out,  and we had to wake up the person in the office when we checked out at... 10am</Review>< Date>

I stayed here this weekend for one night as part of a school trip. We booked 9 rooms. The rooms were clean and had plenty of towels. Rooms had a microwave and mini fridge. Beyond that, I forgot my glasses during my stay and they shipped them to my home free of charge! Great service. There's also a delicious Thai restaurant nearby.</text>

Dirty, old rooms. No toilet tissue in bathroom. Was given room next door to latino field workers who partied all night outside of room in parking lot. They were cooking by 2 grills next to room door - was major fire hazard. No phone in room. No remote for TV. Will not use any Red Roof Inns again.<//Review>

< Review>
The rooms were nice, especially for a budget hotel. Customer service, not so much. There was a coffee pot in the lobby but when I asked about morning coffee, I was told to go to McDonald's. Checking in after a reservation was made and 7 hours of driving was difficult.  I came down in the morning to pay for another night and no one answered. I had to clear out the room just in case so I went to another hotel. NO coffee makers in the rooms. Tiny desk, very small refrigerator, laundry area was very disturbing. If you stop by for 1 or 2 nights and do not drink coffee or need tabletop accommodations, this is a good spot. If you're here for a week or more, there are 3 other hotels in the immediate area that are far better.< /Review>

One of the best place to stay off of The Old Buisness Route Hwy 58.
The other two businesses on the south side of the road are ultra run down & in bad shape. The Desert Inn is the worst.< /review>

Great manager.  Got in late and he got me a room fast.  Since it was late not much to choose from so I walked down the road to try grab something but the dining areas were closed.  When I came back he checked my room out and even turned the ac on.  When I told I  manager they were closed he offered to drive me thru the drive through since I was in a big rig.  Nice way to end a tough day. For the service and treatment I would expect to pay more than $60 for the night. 👍👍👍<//Review>

There was not a telephone in the room. The bathroom was in need of several minor repairs. The bed was lumpy. Pros: I found no signs of bedbugs.

<Text>Not the fanciest place around but it gets the job done. WiFi is decent, microwave and mini fridge in room as well as full tub. Best part about this place is that you don’t hear the train at night. Train track runs right along the Sierra Hwy. This place is far enough off the highway to where you don’t hear the trains all night like at both Motel 6s in town.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Great place to rest your head.  It is very clean and looks like it has recently been remodeled.   The girl at the front desk was very courteous and accommodating.  If I'm in the area again I know where I will be staying...</review>

<Review>Bed bugs. I don’t think I really need to say anymore. And it just isn’t a clean place. I’m sure everyone is nice enough but I have 51 bites all over my body. Unfortunately I’m also having a severe allergic reaction to them. My little ones thankfully only had a few bites or an insignificant reaction to them. Sleep in your car rather than this place.</Review>< gmap_id>

The exterior looked maintained, there were plenty of nice well kept work trucks parked in the lot, so I'd say this place might be one of the nicer, but I wouldn't know.

This place said open and had vacancy yet after ringing the bell 4 times at 3am no one came out to help me.  I totally understand if you're not going to accept guest late night who really just can't drive on any further, but turn off the lights then!

The Desert Inn just down the block got right up took my cash, and handed me a key.< /review>

< Review>
These rooms were definitely freshly redone. New bed and tv. New hardwood floors. Nice tiled bathroom. New ac unit adjusts the temp in the room super quickly!
The front desk was manned by a sweet couple who went above and beyond to be accommodating!
The wifi works great and the price can't be beaten in Mohave.
The room was a real diamond in the rough here. Felt more like a Hilton at a budget level price. Awesome deal!< /Review>

We stopped here on the way back from mammoth because this was the first town that had anything available on a holiday weekend that wasnt highway robbery on the prices..  It had pretty decent reviews online so i thought why not.. The only reason I am giving two stars instead of one is because they checked us in very late..  When we got to the room it was dirty,  makeup stains on pillows,  dirt on headboards bathroom was so dirty.. Air conditioner would not stay on and when it did it was very loud..  Every other motel in the area has free continental breakfast except this one..  Would not stay here again..  But we were so tired we could not drive any further..< /text>

Simple, not fancy place to stay. Has refrigerator n microwave, flat screen, free Wi-Fi. O did notice that the smoke detector battery door was open n missing. Everything looked clean, older style furniture, but functional. It's on a kind of industrial road, not noisy or anything. Restaurant are less than a mile or so away.<//text>

< Review>
I booked this room when I suffered a blown tire with no spare in the middle of nowhere. When traveling alone, my room requirements are four walls, a roof, a bed, and dogs allowed.

I prepaid the room on Priceline, and I called in advance to make sure someone would be there when I checked in(it was already late and I was waiting on a tow).

I arrived tired, wanting only for the towing company to drop the car so I could unload my car and lay down.

The man that came to the front desk was immediately confrontational about the rate Priceline had booked me at. He insisted that I show my confirmation after I explained that I had paid more than whatever his computer was showing.

After showing my confirmation, he started asking me if “Priceline really took a 20% commission” and that it’s not fair, and then tried to refuse to give me a room. I said that I would if he gave me a refund, to which he promptly told me to “take it up with Priceline.”

I eventually got a room, but only after listening to this guy complain about a myriad of issues that had nothing to do with me.

During my brief stay in Mojave, the people I interacted with were genuinely good to their core...with the exception of the owner of the red roof inn.< /Review>

The door didnt work properly, we had to have someone open it for us, there was dust and dirty in many places, no shampoo, the beds and pillows were not very comfortable, the pool was drained. There was just a lot of negative factors. The only upside was that there was no use with our late 10:30 check in.< /Text>

I ordered the Goat Cheese Omelette and it was delicious. An interesting combination with artichokes and chives - I definitely recommend it as a pleasant vegetarian breakfast option. The hash browns that came with my omelette were a bit too greasy to my taste, I will get the home fries next time instead. Great breakfast food and reasonable quality of cafe latte. Will be back!< /Text>

Food was delicious, and service was SUPER fast. No in door dining/seating as of 3-20-21, however there are plenty of seats outdoors with heaters and cover. Good price for what you get, and the atmosphere was cozy and inviting. We will definitely be coming back!< /Review>

<text>Great experience! Outdoor dining, great weather, friendly staff, and yes good food. Always better on weekdays vs weekends as no waiting. Try the Huevos con Chorizo, salmon crepe and the house special is always good. Guatemalan coffee to top it off.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMsjiZXIOfl23gvmNa2uXxJ6O48ZCXeckM0Hko8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAZwLJIawqkVTzH0OzFOHd5H3Sei-UMN9gyEbE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< resp>

Breakfast all day.... I'm in!  Wonderful breakfast and lunch selections.  I love that they offer a variety of sides...not just potatoes.  Service was great, very attentive.  Prices are fair.  They also have specialty coffees.</review>

<text>Wonderful little spot near Stanford with great service and delicious food. We came on a Sunday and noticed the local Farmer’s Market was set up across the street. We had a small party got there early which allowed us to get seated faster. We sat at the bar and had excellent prompt service. Servers were very on top of filling up our coffee. What set them above and beyond was that I accidentally spilled my coffee and the service was so quick to respond I had fresh napkins and a clean spot shortly after. Great experience overall and we recommend to anyone coming through.<//text>< Name>

<review>They are more like 3.5 stars, but I feel generous. This analysis is before the strict instructions for lockdown.

I have always walked past this cafe, but until now, I have never managed to eat here. We came for an early brunch, and fortunately it's just not packed as usual yet. The outdoor seating is spacious and shady. We were sitting in a corner and the menu was conveniently taped to the table.

I got a smoked omelette of salmon and it was fine, but I should have demanded that the cream cheese be withheld. There's a really fluffy omelette.

Our waiter is very sweet, polite, and focused on protection. He asked us to ensure that when we order or when food is delivered to us, we wear our masks.

Overall, this is an excellent place for quick, attentive service.< /review><resp>None< /resp>< name>

<Review>Joanie's Café never disappoints.

They have plenty of outdoor seating with heaters. There's still a line and wait time like pre Covid but service it very fast and friendly.
The menu is laminated on the table so you don't have to touch one and they clean well after a table leaves.

Goat the goat cheese omelette for the first time and it was delicious.</Review><name>Nicole Spoljar< /name><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9EkO-zeThHnHmECtEc0YYUlZKog8QI_UviUnK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKNXthvrsB9SayKYMXakZUccEdJFdEPehAoFC_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< resp>

Good place to do take out orders.  They are taking extra care to package breakfasts carefully, so it comes as close and possible to eating in.  We appreciate the effort.  The food is great, as it always has been<//review>

The place has a very good setup for covid. You can enjoy the brunch in the bright and open seating. Very helpful and amazing staff. Their special muffin (buttermilk tangerine muffin) was just amazing. Good coffee as well!< /Review>

DISAPPOINTING! I just ordered from this place. For an omlette that isn't big at all, was $20. Totally over priced if you ask me. The quality was just not there. Not only did I order this with a side of toast, they seemed to have lost the toast.

This was ordered at 9:47am and my food was delivered to me by 10:31am. It was not Door Dash is delay either. I watched the status of my order the entire time on my screen. I am literally less than a mile away from here. I heard this place was mediocre but I wanted to try it out and won't be coming back.<//Text>

Food was great, but beware of the wait! We visited on a Saturday afternoon at 12.30spm and waited until about 1.30 to be seated. Be sure to sit outside if it's a nice day, definitely worth it. Whole-wheat pancakes were yummy, as were country potatoes. Hubby liked the burger. Staff were friendly but closed right on time - 2.15pm.< /review>

The place has a very good setup for covid and they give instructions to ensure everyone follows them. You can enjoy the bright and open seating. Very helpful and amazing staff. The service is very good.
We got the scrambled eggs and egg benedict, both were great! I am sure I will try the French toast next time! Their special muffin (buttermilk tangerine muffin) was just amazing. Super light and tangy; and went great with coffee! Good coffee as well!

Would highly recommend for a calm and chill brunch or evening coffee or bite!<//review>

We were treated to wonderful service and excellent food this morning. The unhurried, friendly atmosphere made for an unforgettable (in a good way) breakfast. The Salmon Benedict was delicious and the hash browns were prepared as ordered- extra crispy. I’m looking forward to our next visit.</Review><Gmap_id>0x808fbae5f439782b:0x7acba1d408420ee5</Gmap_id><date>1526669326547< /date>< UserId.>

<text>I love having brunch here and have been here a few times!
I always got the Smoked Salmon Egg Benedicts with hash brown and they come with seasonal and colorful fruit on the side.
Excellent services with friendly staff, a very nice place for Brunch :)< /text>< name>

This place is popular. I came on a day where it was rainy, and people were still lined up to go! They had heaters out which was nice. Wait wasn't long at all. Food was great! I had a shrimp and crab scramble :)<//Text>

Came here on a Thursday noon and had to wait about 10 minutes for a table for 2!

Food: I had gone for an open faced breakfast sandwich and boy was it huge! I was pleasantly surprised how large the whole portion was, each face was like a meal and the hash browns were really well done and crispy!

Service: Food actually came quite quickly in 10 minutes or so! The waiters didn’t check on us too often but refilled our waters occasionally.

Ambiance: Classy brunch location! Pretty casual but still classy.

Overall, a standard brunch restaurant with decent prices and good portions!<//text>

Quality of food is good but it's a bit overpriced for their portion size. The person who was refilling coffee came to our table to offer a refill when we were signing the check and were about to leave.< /Review>

<review>Very good food and service. The wait was a bit long but expected for 8 people on Saturday morning. We waited about 45 mins but worth the wait. They won't seat you until all people in the party are there. And they don't take reservations as expected. Quite busy place. Try the Mexican scramble!< /review>< pics>

<Text>Good service, nice atmosphere, and LOTS of coffee refills. Definitely got my caffeine fix for the day.

Got the smoked salmon egg benedict and it was delicious! Loved to see that fresh fruit is included with the home fries. Friend got the beef hash which looked amazing. Would like to come back sometime.<//Text>< user_name>

We came here on a Saturday at around 1.30pm for brunch and it was quite packed. We had to wait but the wait went quick. We sat outside which was nice because they have heaters.

We got the goat cheese ommlette and the Mexican scramble with hash browns. Both were excellent! I particularly loved the goat cheese ommlette.</text>

Great tasting breakfast and friendly staff. Came early in the morning to try out their corned beef with hash browns. I believe I read on the menu that the corner beef was made in-house as well as their hash browns. When I order corned beef hash, I like to order it with sunny side eggs and mix it in with the hash browns and corned beef. Once mixed in, I eat it on top of the toast. Honestly, everything was great and I think it was the best breakfast spot I've experienced during my time in Palo Alto.</Review>

The restaurant is tiny and often has a wait on Friday mornings around 9am. Today we were lucky and were seated right away.
The eggs were nicely done (over hard as I requested). The bacon comes a little more cooked than I usually prefer but still tasty.

I always have to request extra butter for my toast but the bread is really nice and fluffy.

The hash browns are awesome and come with onions and little diced red peppers.

Overall I like this place and it's service.< /review>

Very popular brunch place. There's always a long waiting line. If you're not too hungry, it worth the waiting. Egg Benedict is very good !< /Text>

My sister and I chose this place because it was our aunt's name. We were very glad we did. The outdoor seating was lovely.
The menu selection made it hard to choose! Everything we ordered was delicious. My sister had a latte, and said it was the best she'd ever had. The food was fresh and delicious. The prices weren't horrible.
Overall a very good choice!<//text>

We were 5 people plus one kid went for breakfast for this upmarket cafe at Palo Alto. There is seating outside and inside the cafe.  We were able to seat for 5 but one of us has to squzee in .
I ordered crepe complete ( Two scramabled eggs,Swiss feta cheddar cheese served with seasonal fruits) the portions was big and I finished with difficulty.  Fruits were generous in number .
Other people  ordered Hauvenos Santa fe, Goat cheese omelette, cherries french toast and orange Juice ,coffee and cappuccino.  Orange juice was yummy. All items were served sliced fruit, choice of hash browns or home fries.

The service was good and the food ahs big portions and generous sliced fruit and tasty was  very good< /Text>

It was a solid restaurant. Staff was friendly and service was fast. My breakfast was nice, but not terribly memorable. I wish the flavors were a bit stronger. It seems some elements were toned down to be more palatable for a wider audience, but still measures of quality such as how the egg was cooked, plating, and ingredient ratios were all on point.<//Review>

<Review>You can smell the yummy goodness of what's in store for you long before you reach the door. Met a friend there for breakfast. We picked it based on Yelp reviews. In spite of the extensive, varied menu, I knew what I wanted as soon as I saw it: they had me at "goat cheese omelet". She ordered the smoked salmon omelette. Both were hearty proportions, and came with a choice of fruit or potatoes AND choice of toast or banana muffin. I think the highlight of the meal was the shredded- style hash browns. Total comfort food. Muffin was so-so... kind of dry and a little over baked, I thought.  I bake so I am really picky. My friend liked it, though. Place had a nice homey feel, and I was glad we were there early because it got busy later and there was a line to get in as we were leaving. They didn't pressure us to leave and we were able to sit and visit. On a nicer day, they have a nice outside area in front which is also good for people watching on the main California St. drag. Overall a great experience and I will definitely be back.< /Review>< Pics>

Absolutely love this place. Food quality and quantity is great. I’m always super full after going there.
On weekends you’ll definitely need to wait a while to get a table. But if you’re party of two, you’ll get seated within 10-15 mins.
Their staff are always friendly and attentive.<//Text>

Nice little breakfast/lunch Cafe, with pretty wide selection to choose from. Staff is extraordinairely friendly, and definitely makes the atmosphere here worth coming back to. If that doesn't do it for you the food definitely will. We all ordered something relatively different and all the dishes came out perfectly. There's also a nice outdoor dining area, that is great after a nice hike. I couldn't really find anything to complain about to be honest, service was fast, all the servers constantly checked on you to make sure you have water and coffee, and checked on our food several times to make sure that it was up to our par. Most importantly, what you come here for, the food was great. If you're in the area, come try it out.< /text>

Great food and a good variety of food options both in veg and non veg. We ordered pancakes, french toast, grilled veggie burger and crepes, everything tasted amazing and the portion sizes are as per one full meal!
For coffee lovers, their brewed coffee would not disappoint!< /Text>

<review>Great american food,   We went for brunch.  Inside the restaurant is noisy.  Outside seating is available and was better for our group.   Lotʻs of children and families.   Outside seating is best for wheelchairs just because there is more space .  We had to wait for a table on a Saturday morning ...</review>< UserId.>

<review>Very popular spot for brunch!  Serving sizes are good, staff is friendly, put your name on the list and wait!  Your whole group does need to be present to be seated.  They have both indoor and outdoor seating, food comes out quickly, staff is friendly!

I was pleasantly surprised. Never heard of the place. It was spotless and the  food and service where outstanding. In an area with fusion, tai, vegan etc it was nice to have a tasty steak and egg breakfast. We will definitely go out of our way to eat there again. Bravo.<//review>

I'm not totally sure what happened, I think maybe the cap for the salt came off when they were making my food, so my experience may not be characteristic. The potatoes were almost inedible, though I was hungry, so ultimately edible. The place has a nice vibe though it has apparently achieved the network effect of brunch places where you need to hang around for awhile before being seated (I am still not sure the mechanism behind this effect, it does not seem to be related to the quality of the place, but more the "coolness" or "transmission of desirability"? Still trying to figure this out, it may need more focused study). Not sure I need to go back here, though I always catch a bit of uplifting energy as I walk by on California street heading somewhere else.</Review>

This place had great reviews so I tried it with my best friend.  Atmosphere was totally Palo Alto.  This is a place where busy friends meet to catch up on life while enjoying a meal together.  We had the breakfast.  We had barely sat down and ordered when the food arrived almost instantly.  I had french toast with potatoes and eggs.  The eggs were hot and made to order.  The potatoes were made at least several hours ahead and had been sitting in oils and arrived barely warm.  The french toast would have been fantastic if made fresh instead of in a batch kept under a warmer.  I like the plate and food to be hot.  The clientele here seemed pleased with mediocre food.  The burgers looked much better than the breakfast.  They were hot off the grill and people were devouring the fries so they must be good.  At a cafe with Palo Alto pricing, I expected a homestyle straight off the grill hot meal.  I was sadly disappointed.  Forgot...the servers were fantastic.<//text>

It was a lovely place to have a nice breakfast. Definitely a change of pace. When I arrived a quarter to 9 in the morning it was nearly empty and very quiet. Within minutes the place was filled. I got there just in time to get my order quickly. The Omelette was delicious. It was goat cheese and artichoke hearts. Such a beautiful combination that I would have never thought of.< /Review>

Joanie’s Cafe is a good choice for some reliable if unexciting comfort food. The service is friendly and fast, the food is reasonable and you’ll be neither disappointed nor delighted. If you’re in the mood for some quick and mediocre comfort food then this is the spot for you; if you’re looking to satiate the more adventurous foodie in you then this may not hit the mark.<//text>

Super large portions and good service but the food is not great.
No organic ingredients. Poor coffee. My kids did not like the pancakes as the butter and syrup tasted odd to them. My salmon crepe upset my stomach.
Not recommended.< /Review>

<user>112648842151274542476<//user><resp>None< /resp><Rating>4</Rating><Review>Joanie's Cafe is such a nice place to have breakfast/brunch at! It has a homey vibe, seating indoors and out. The servers and staff were all very kind during my visit. It was a very comfortable environment.

I ordered the eggs benedict w/ smoked salmon, came with fresh fruit and my choice of hashbrown over fries. My boyfriend ordered the chorizo omelette with his choice of hashbrown and sourdough toast. I honestly loved my dish, the crunch and crispiness of the hashbrown the fresh fruit selection didn't go bad. And the main star of the dish, the smoked salmon benedict, had a very nice runny yolk and the sauce was light. I usually never had smoked salmon with my eggs benedict, so it was a nice change to my usual!

I'm never in the Palo Alto area, but if I'm back and want brunch then I'd definitely come back!< /Review>< username>

I came here on a Saturday morning for breakfast around 9:15AM, and the place was packed! Even though I came by myself, I still had to wait about 10 minutes. It was worth it though! I ordered the French toast, and the food came out quite quickly. I'm not sure whether I ordered the wrong item but it didn't have berries like I wanted; there was an array of other fruits which was fine but I would've preferred the berries. Anyway, the French toast was really soft and it was delicious. I really enjoyed the meal a lot! The service here isn't great because it's a bit overrun; it took me a while to get my order taken and for the check to get handed to me. If you're not in a rush, I would definitely recommend giving this place a try!< /Text>

< review>
A very cute cafe with great service and good tasty food. We went for brunch on a reasonably warm spring Saturday morning. There was a reasonable amount of wait to get a table and we decided to sit outside. The tower heaters provided a nice touch to keep us warm with the unpredictable bay area weather.

Food was delicious and service was attentive. What is brunch if not for having a few good mimosas. They all are tasty! Highly recommend this restaurant for people watching , tasty food, and it's attentive service!</review>

Worth the short wait that is almost always there.  High quality, fresh and non-greasy breakfast.  The smoked salmon benedict, the breakfast burrito and the freshly baked muffins are awesome.</Review>

I cannot say enough about Joanie’s Cafe. It was the most wonderful discovery! The dishes were outstanding and so beautifully displayed. The ambiance was charming and the service first class. The best part was that they were not out to make political statements and we were offered biodegradable/compostable straws and we were not assessed a surcharge. We have stopped patronizing restaurants that add the 5%+ surcharge and make us feel like scum when we ask for a compostable straw. We love this place and will definitely return as well as spread the word!!< /Text>

<Text>We were looking for a traditional breakfast while we were staying in Palo Alto, and we stumbled upon Joanie’s Cafe at 405 California Ave, just a block off El Camino. The staff were delightful and the food was everything we’d were wanting. My corned beef has was made in house and delicious, and unlike at most breakfast joints, my wife’s poached eggs were just right. But the best tell that this is a terrific place is that every local we told about our breakfast said, “Oh, Joanie’s? That’s where we go for breakfast! We love it!”</Text>< user>

THE best brunch place I've been to in the Bay Area. The brunch food and service are both amazing. My favorite things to get here are the eggs benedicts. The line during brunch/lunchtime on weekends can get a bit long. I went with a group of 4 on a Saturday, and we waited about 50 minutes before we got seated. I've also gone there about half an hour before they closed on the weekend, and there wasn't much of a wait. Either way, it's worth it.< /review>

Best brunch I have had in a while. It is currently rated best Brunch Location in Yelp as well. I ordered a basic crepe and yet it managed to taste amazing. Each order comes with fruit and hashbrowns I believe.< /Review>

Big portion for the proce, making it an excellent brunch spot. Hashbrowns were good without ketchup and the crepe I got was so good I cleaned the plate. I just wish they had more options without pork products, but the fish was fine and the veggie options sounded excellent too. Would go back to impress others.</Text>

<review>Had a great time trying this place out for the first time. I had the Smoked Salmon Omelet with homefries and blueberry muffin. It was delicious! Tried the Pineapple and pomegranate syrup mimosa too. The service was great, and I swear they hire ninjas with the way the servers always came out of nowhere to fill up our waters. Even during a busy Sunday morning they were always aware of their customers. Delicious food and amazing service, I would definitely recommend.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

As far as breakfast places go, Joanie's is a solid and safe choice for a great start to your morning. While there is usually a long wait on the weekends (especially on Sunday with the farmers market outside), it's worth it. I generally go with a make-your-own omelet, but have also ventured into their pancakes and waffles.<//Review>

I was here for brunch but couldn’t
secure a seat early enough due to the long wait time.

I was too starved to wait another 30 minutes so        had to move to the next available restaurant.

However, my brief interaction with the waitress was warm, friendly and the coffee was good.

On my next visit, I’ll factor in the wait and expect to be served something delicious.<//review>

Reliably good food in a cozy neighborhood cafe.  Prices in line with the local area, but that's a bit higher than for a comparable cafe in most other Bay Area suburbs.  Attentive and very pleasant staff.<//Text>

Yummy breakfast. I like the bustling atmosphere and the friendly service at Joanie's. Try the French Toast. My wife orders it with a side of bacon. I almost always have a scramble or omelet. There is usually a wait on weekends, but they have benches and outdoor heaters in winter.< /text>

I live in a rural part of CA, so the pricing was a bit high than would a typical diner breakfast be for me, but the meal was excellent.  I had the chorizo omelette w/ home fries and toast.  A bit spicier would have been nice, but it was otherwise a generous and well prepared ommy.  Late on Friday morning, there was around a 20 minute wait, but the service was fast and accurate.  Don't know if/when I'll be able to go again, but Joanie's is on my go to list, situation permitting.< /Text>

We have been here 2 times already. The food has been always very good. Wide selection and delicious. What we didn't like each time was the service. They treated us without any attention. Did not even look at us when we were ordering food with her and did not check on us regularly. I understand that sometimes, after a long day, you do not want to engage with people. I am sure it is not normal for this place, but it happened to us each time, unfortunately.</text>

<Review>We were visiting my sister. It’s a small restaurant with a family atmosphere.  We wanted to try different breakfast places while we were visiting. But this one wasn’t one that we enjoyed. Customer service was good but the Food was overpriced and mediocre. The breakfast was nothing special or stood out. The portions were ok for the price. My search continues for a breakfast place in California. I would try another place in town.</Review><name>Jenny McIntosh<//name>< Pics>

< Review>
I went to Joanie's early in the morning, so there was plenty of room, but the place filled up quickly. I ordered crepes and granola, but the portions are huge, so I left quite a bit on the plate. The granola was simply delicious. The crepes less so, but they were good. The coffee was also good.

The waiters seemed a bit confused and inexperienced, but they were still nice.<//Review>

The food was very very decent brunch food.  The omelet was well-cooked with lots of fresh ingredients; eggs and corned beef hash were both solid.  The Belgian waffle was a bit more chewy than my liking.  The hash browns were definitely the highlight - crispy on both sides, and well-seasoned.
We'd probably come back again, but next time we'll get here either earlier or later to avoid the brunch crunch.< /Review>< Rate>

Upscale, clean, attentive wait staff.  Breakfast was good, but not outstanding for the price.  Not surprisingly, waited about 30 mins for a table on a Sunday morning.<//Text>

Nice breakfast place in Palo Alto. Either try the freshly squeezed orange 🍊 juice or the mimosa’s. The menu has variety of options for veggie lovers as well.</Review>

Super fun place for brunch and lunch on the weekends. It is always crowded and the people here are so friendly. Joanie's is really a treasure in Palo Alto and is loved by so many locals. I recommend the salads but all of the food is good.<//Review>

I have been there many many many times for the offer two years so service is great. My favorite is their hash brown. Second is their feta omelette because of the crispy bacon bites in the egg, yummm. It us bet favorful already so I usually ask for no feta on the omelette. Their options are huge and good to split and share.</review>

A nice cafe downtown Palo Alto. Food was good, I had some breakfast eggs (omlette) . The food was ok , nothing special the service was good too. It was really crowded so make sure u can accommodate waiting time. It is a tad expensive compared to other diners.one weird thing was that food was a little cold by the time it came in.< /Text>

<Review>Great food, decent mimosas -- they let you choose what type of juice to mix with your champagne. Not the best service though to be honest. No, the servers weren't rude or anything, but it took a while to flag someone down to put in our order, get the check, etc.<//Review><Response>None<//Response>< pictures>

We came here for lunch. The service was nice. The food super greasy. I couldn't finish my sandwich because it was so soaked in fat. It was really yummy and it was probably olive oil but it was just too greasy for me. But besides that the food is good. My husband was happy with his burger.</text>

Waited for about 45 minutes to get a seat. We ordered some of the vegetarian stuff and it was quite underwhelming. Had the garden burger (have tasted better).< /Review>

Absolutely the worst. Waited in line for 70 minutes with my kids, only to have the hostess seat a table that arrived 15 minutes after us because, 'they are running late for something' and asked if they could be seated. When I asked why we were skipped, I got a glare, a rude answer, and decided to skip this BASIC spot. There's nothing special about the food here.</Text>

Not by coincidence voted as best breakfast place, we waited for an hour and it was worth it! Super friendly and quick service, food tasty (had salmon benedicts) with fair portions. Nice vibe, good location, you can check farmers market on Sunday mornings.

Only surprise was $5.4 for 4 pieces of side bacon.</Review>

Great cafe, good service.  I get the steak and eggs or the steak frites almost every time.  But my friends live the omelettes and other breakfast items too.   Service is always friendly.  Gets busy and you can wait for a table at peak hours.</Text>

<Review>Love the waffles they serve @ brunch although expect a pretty substantial wait on the weekend.  They also have delicious dinners-even breakfast for dinner, which is awesome.  The owner is also very friendly.</Review><gmap_id>0x808fbae5f439782b:0x7acba1d408420ee5<//gmap_id>< pics>

It's okay, but it's expensive. Its typical of modern Palo Alto. Luxury prices for lackluster food and service. Still, the food is perfectly passable, if no more than that.< /Review>

I just spent $24 on tea, omlette, and a chicken apple sausage. The tea was great, the rest mediocre. Ordered the feta omlette. The bacon was burnt inside,  overall taste even disregarding the bacon issue was bland. I asked for salsa hoping to salvage it, obviously was salsa from a jar. The sausage was awful both in taste and was overcooked. Two stars for pleasant atmosphere and decent servers.</text>

<Text>Great breakfast! We tried the mexican omelette and the daily special french toast - both were delicious and inventive (omlette included tortilla strips, black beans, and salsa, and every bite was packed with flavor). Large selection of sweet and savory classics with fresh flavor twists. They had gluten-free toast available. We were there at 9am on a Saturday and got a table right away, but there was a wait list forming behind us. Outdoor seating very pleasant with heat lamps in cool weather. Friendly service. Would eat here again!< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I feel bad because this place is really cute and the wait-staff is nice.  But, I think the food is pretty bad.  We had the pancakes, which tasted like bisquick.  We had the more expensive brioche french toast, and I swear it tasted like anti-stick spray for a griddle.  There wasn't much else taste to it than that.  After adding syrup (which I'm pretty sure wasn't even maple) it was edible.</Text>< pics>

<review>Joanie's is a favorite neighborhood destination.  It's a great place to go for a basic bacon and eggs breakfast, but they also have terrific breakfast specials, omelets and scrambles, and oatmeal.  If you have the choice between toast or muffin, try the muffin, they are delicious, baked daily with fresh fruit.  Yum!< /review><gmap_id>0x808fbae5f439782b:0x7acba1d408420ee5<//gmap_id>< resp>

<review>I feel bad because this place is really cute and the wait-staff is nice.  But, I think the food is pretty bad.  We had the pancakes, which tasted like bisquick.  We had the more expensive brioche french toast, and I swear it tasted like anti-stick spray for a griddle.  There wasn't much else taste to it than that.  After adding syrup (which I'm pretty sure wasn't even maple) it was edible.<//review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Service is a bit slow. I was waiting a long for a bill, and then waiter told me that they don't accept discover credit card. I expect from the stuff to know these things before they going to swipe the card. It's a waist of time.
Prices are somewhat high, but portions are huge.</Review>

Went here on a sunny afternoon. I ordered the Fettuccine Carbonara which was good but was a bit bland. Nothing in particular was wrong with the experience, but it was just average - thus the average rating (3 of 5 stars).<//Text>

One of my favorite places for breakfast in Palo Alto. I've been there many times and food was always very tasty. I like their Crêpe Bretonne, Eggs Benedict, various omelettes. Hash browns are better than usual.
The only negative thing is *huge* waiting lines on weekends.</Review>

< Review>
Waited for a table on Sunday at a busy time. Put name on waitlist. Waited 50 minutes. 5th member of our party was walking to place.  Would not sit the 4 present of the 5.  Gave away our table.  Ridiculous customer service at the entrance. Cannot seat 4 of party of 5 when 5th is walking here.< /Review>

We went there for brunch, and all of the food we had was good to very good: Eggs Benedict, blueberry muffin, bacon, corned beef hash, and hashed browns. The exception were the scrambled eggs, which were dry and flavorless (maybe they use liquid eggs, yuck). The drinks were excellent. They served my wife's Americano as an espresso with pitchers of hot water and hot (!) cream so she could doctor it to her own satisfaction, something that we've never seen before and hope becomes a trend. They served my Mimosa with the remainder of a split of Blanc de Noir and a little pitcher of orange juice, so I was able to get something like three helpings out of it. And the service was excellent. Warning: portions are large. A very solid brunch option!</review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) It's always very crowded from the morning! They will line up, so we recommend that you go early!

The French toast is quite voluminous, but it was delicious without being too sweet!

(Translated by Google) It is a place where you can eat American breakfast properly. You have to wait, but the taste of the food is enough to compensate. Especially for tourists, it is a place not to be regretted to go to and eat. It is not exactly what is happening in front of the store, but it is supposed to be held on Sundays and it is a good spectacle.

(Original)
미국식 아침을 제대로 먹을 수 있는 곳이다. 기다려야하지만 음식맛으로 충분히 보상이 된다. 특히 여행객에게는 찾아가서 먹는 수고를 해도 후회되지 않는 곳이다. 가게앞에 시골장이 열리는데  정확하지는 않지만 일요일이어서 열리는 것으로 추측되는데 좋은 구경거리이다.</Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Very good breakfasts, very tasty potatoes and perfectly cooked eggs (liquid yolk as I like it), although going on a Sunday in the morning can be crazy for the amount of people that go.

(Translated by Google) Absolutely incredible! We came here for breakfast and were surprised by the incredible service, space and food. The place has indoor and outdoor space. Although large, the number of people is so great that you may have to wait a little while to sit down. Regarding the menu, we went for breakfast so we only focused on these options, which are already very diverse! Prices are around $ 15. Here you can order from pancakes to eggs. Very nice and wonderful space!

Absolutamente incrivel! Viemos aqui para tomar o pequeno-almoço e fomos surpreendidos por um serviço, espaço e comida incriveis. O local tem espaço interior e exterior. Apesar de amplo, a quantidade de pessoas é tanta que pode ter de ficar a espera um pouco para sentar. Relativamente à carta, fomos para pequeno-almoço por isso só nos focámos nestas opções que já são muito diversas! Os preços rondam os 15 dólares. Aqui pode pedir desde panquecas a ovos. Muito bom e maravilhoso espaço!</text>
