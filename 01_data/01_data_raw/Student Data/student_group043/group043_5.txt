I went to 4MBA for livescan and had an amazing experience. The people working there had such great attitudes and sent my finger prints to the correct location. I needed to do an expense report and lost my receipt. I called with the expectation that it might be too much trouble. I called and had the receipt in 1 minute after verification of course. Thank you so much!!</Review>

Instead i got formidable advices on how to get better on my taxes.4MBA employees are  professionally coordinated and outstanding. I recommend 4MBA for your taxes, book keeping and other business operations. 4MBA is with a standard to recon with.< /review><time>1579045985864</time><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Super solid guys. I moved pretty far away two years ago and it’s still very worth it to me to make the 2 hour drive  to see these guys. Before them I went to H&R Block for years and now I’m taking home waaaayyyyyyyyyy more from my taxes. You will not be disappointed! Give them a try!!</Review>

I stopped by 4MBA oneday and they immediately sat me down and talked to me about what they could do for me, and I really appreciated that they took the time to answer all of my questions. They helped me identify deductions that enabled me to maximize my refund for 2013. This is a great place to get your taxes done!</Text>< Pics>

I feel a lot more confident about getting my taxes done thanks to 4mba Income Tax. I had normally gotten my taxes done online (and had some apprehension) but after coming here I have a clear and concise way of getting my taxes serviced.<//Text>

We were in and out quickly. The gentleman that helped us said that this particular store is generally steady busy and not crazy busy like the one on Jamboree. Maybe that will help you. Hope so<//text>

<Review>Myself and my family switched over from T-M to Verizon this month at laguna hills verizon store.. From beginning, we are having lot of difficulties and run in to issues for getting proper functionality. Due to Pandemic, LH store was closed for two + weeks. The Mgr. Gus at LH store referred us to Omar Rosas at this Tustin Store. OMAR is smart and knows what he is doing. He figured out the problem on my son's line from Verizon's system, and was able to help contact the corporate and get it fixed.  He spent 3 hours to take care of us with patience. Then my daughter's phone line was not working with getting a new phone activated... we had to go again to his store. OMAR took his time to help get the problem corrected...issues were at the Verizon's end.  ....Omar has provided the best customer service I ever received at Verizon stores. He is knowledgeable and smart.!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<text>Came here to activate my Apple Watch on business line.  Went online and it says to bring watch and phone to store and they will get it done.  At store is a different story as they told me to contact my business rep but he doesnt work on weekends.

Only come to this store if you are spending money.   If you need help with your products.  They will just pass off as this can be done at store as this is where I had it first connected.

Verizon stores are a mess.  Just avoid them and buy online.< /text>< pics>

Tried to get satisfaction over the phone, No luck. Had to go to the Verizon store to find someone who enabled a feature in my account (not in my phone). Only time will tell if that solves my lack of coverage issue.< /Review>

Went in to switch over from AT&T after being with them for over 15 years. Omar the manager pushed a plan that wasn't part of the Buy one iphone 11 get one free saying that if I purchased $200+ in accessories that he would provide 2 - $200 credits towards my bills. I tried to contact Omar and his cell phone no longer takes calls. Extremely frustrating and regret ever stepping in this store.< /text>

<text>So much confusion with one of the sales associates, I simply wanted to turn in a device for a down payment and she was confused throughout the whole process as if she was a newbie.. she messed up the plans and deals like 5 times kept going back and forth smh.. until the GM stepped in it basically took over the whole situation with me getting a new device. He helped a lot then at the end we came to an agreement and she still managed to mess up again... lol y’all stores needs more experienced workers...<//text>< time>

<Review>I was told about a deal, by one of their employees, that was going on for the s10 where I could bring in an old phone up to an s4 and as long as the front screen wasn't cracked. So I brought in my s7 with a small crack on the back and then suddenly they changed it and said that I could only get half the normal trade-in value instead of the promo value they were offering.<//Review>< pics>

<text>Went in to buy a new phone. I already know what I want. Nobody available as I walked in so I waited for about 15 minutes for someone to become available. Once someone became free he was in the corner on his phone. Unfortunately, went to another store and had the salesperson be rude. Guess it's the company not just this store.<//text><gmapID>0x80dcdc21ddc96315:0xfca40096a8e1daae< /gmapID><Rate>1<//Rate><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Date>

Went to this store last Nov. Me and my wife got a “trade your old phone and get $300 off” deal to move to Verizon. They also introduced a plan for small business which best start with 5+ lines and they can transfer our $300*2 credit to new business lines. I brought two employees and my wife to the store on Dec. They started a business line (4 phones and 1 tracker) for us and told us our $600 credit has been transferred to business. “All set”.

We thought we are in a 5-lines, $45 each / month plan.

In fact, my two lines had never been transferred to business because we need to sign extra papers to give up $600 credit first. This credit cannot be transferred from a regular line to business line. Those store guys just didn’t know that. I went to the store many times, they said it was their mistake, but they can do nothing about it.

The store guys said, “Call Verizon is the only way”.

I called Verizon more than 20 times. One of the CS even said, “you signed the paper to open the business account, it is your mistake.”

They told me “go to the store, they might be able to give you the credit, that is the only way”. One of Verizon’s local sales called me and gave me the store manager’s personal number. I called many times, but no one answers.

In the end, we gave up $600 and transfer to our business account. Then we found that they’ve added an unknown line to our account which cost us $100+ already and mischarged some other fees as well. First bill cost $675, which should be no more than $300. I called Verizon for another 4 hours to correct it.

I didn’t make any mistake but lost $600 and at least 24 hours. They made all the mistakes, but they just need to say, “sorry but I can do nothing.” Worst experience ever.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Why I gave a 6. Yes a 6!
The store was clean, Male Employees were attentive, kind gestures, genuine smiles and helpful. They were calm, caring. This put me at ease and helped me feel I could focus on my thoughts and put my energy in overcoming the difficulty I expected to have explaining my husbands non working phone.
But instead they went right to work and now I'm getting a new phone because the LG defaults are continues looping. A manufacture defect. They Over night a new phone and we will receive it tomarrow. Good thing. I'll keep you all posted. Can't wait to witness an overnight delivery according to Verizon and their warranty policy for a manufacture defect.
Cool. Walked away peaceful.</review>

This store is under remodeling, and it's kinda Dusty and it looks smaller but I'm sure when the remodel will be done it's going to be better than before, maybe with some New phones and/or accessories.< /Review>

Had the worst experience ever at this retailer so much so that being a customer after almost 15 years with them I switched to t-mobile so here is what happened...

Me and my girlfriend about a year ago today went into a retailer to upgrade our old phones we both had galaxy 3s upon arrival we where approached by One of the sales reps who will remain nameless but he knows who he is....anyways he shows around and explains about new features with the new note 7's but at the time they where catching fire and not a very reliable phone to get so moving forward he showed us the brand new phones that Verizon had to offer the Motorola droid turbo 2 and Motorola Z Force  instantly we loved our new phones while purchasing and moving forward with the phones he's was explaining to us about all the new products Verizon has to offer, he said we would be able to upgrade after one year after buying the phones and as long as we continue to make our payments we would qualify for this new program we where so excited about this went on our way with our new phones.

So fast forward a year and me and my girlfriend end up hating the phones they had crazy battery issues and kept resetting over and over again so it was about to like to claim the offer that we where told we signed up for..we call Verizon and get ready to upgrade our phones and are told we have to either wait 2 years or payoff the phones which is the complete opposite of what we where explained about. We went on to explain to the store manager what was promised and like a broken record we where told the same thing over and over again like we love to waste our time with 0 results..

This was a huge slap in the face as it seems that Verizon gives 0 f**** about their customers and they can change programs on you at anytime and no one seems to remember what program your in and you're held responsible for the word of the agent after this experience I will never recommend Verizon to anyone nor will I ever recommend this location as well since both the sales rep and the manager have 0 accountability for any of their actions and only the consumer will pay...< /Review>

Have our company controller brought in a iPhone XS Max (that we ordered online from the Verizon website) to the Verizon corporate store at the District in Tustin, and asked them to transfer the setting from the old phone to the new phone, but they refused to do it.  Spent close to $1000 to buy a phone and got no service...  Why pay the premium for Verizon?!</Review>

<Review>I rather drive to this location than the one at the district which is only 2 blocks away from my house.   They actually listen and help rather than "Sell"   you at this location.   The general manager Dustin was awesome and was very helpful.   For some odd reason my account was so messed up (after 3 months of fixing and countless calls to customers care) we thought it was all settled   but nope it wasn't.     He figured it out the mixed up in 10 mins what went wrong with our account,  and called in to fix it.   I would recommend this location over Irvine District location.< /Review><rate>5< /rate>< Pictures>

I bought a phone here, they told me I had 14 days to return for a full refund. They lied to my face. When I bought it back a few days later cause the phone sucked, they said they are giving me only a partial refund and taking a $35 restocking fee. I was never told this. I never signed a receipt, instead I signed a signature tablet they handed me which didn't have any text on it.

Then when I returned it they did not give me a refund but said it would go on my debit card I had paid with. But now days later still no refund. I called they said they were supposed to give me the refund in the store. But they didn't give me a receipt.

I feel like I have been robbed in broad daylight by Verizon employees.<//Text>

<Text>I agree with the others. Worst customer service ever. Lots of sales people that do nothing. I also left my USB card to get it activated and worker indicated that it was all ready to go. When I got home nothing was done to it at all. Call Manger back and they couldn't care less. Don't waste your time at that store.< /Text>< Pictures>

I was here about a week ago to get their tasty bean and cheese burritos. Someone needs to tell this lady that this isn't how you wear a mask. She was talking to the lady at the register while prepping food like this the whole time I was there.

Also my burrito had several chunks of ground beef in it, which wasn't a huge deal for me, but really not good work guys.< /review>

I tried this place on an absolute whim since it was not too far from my place. I was entirely surprised, it was very similar to what I used to get in San Diego. There was a little too much sour cream on the tacos for my liking, but that’s totally adjustable. I know next time to ask for less, not a big deal. The tortillas are crispy on the inside and give a nice cheesy crunch. The carne asada is mouth watering, and they give a generous amount of guacamole. The pricing is very fair. Would go back.<//review>< pics>

< review>
I've been a loyal customer for over 12 years since I started my business Stoneman Fabrications in San Mateo we are constantly driving around  from our shop down the street at 2310 Palm ave to job sites around the bay  Charlie's became our favorite due to their delicious food and salad bar  no to mention the service very efficient very professional we always order for pick up  and if they tell you it will be ready in 10 minutes you better believe it will be ready my employees love Charlie's every time I treat them for lunch or we are around at lunch time nothing beats charlies I personally call it soul food.</review>

Raining when went,so thought extra service. Wrong. Got the cheese enchiladas with no bean.#5. No sause,burnt cheese,and yeah...beans. it's on the top of the menu. Shouldn't be. Other customers was correct got no smile no hi. Just yes and that's it (for me) Ambient  holey seat at counter  with some dirty glassware. Authentic..no.rice had no veggies of any sort. I'd say try another.<//Review>

One of the best burritos in the peninsula. The super burrito is absolutely gigantic so don't eat breakfast before coming! The regular plates are also pretty delicious. Come to Charlie's and you'll never be disappointed<//Text>

<text>What I ordered: super burrito combo with rice and beans
Meat: grilled chicken

The burrito had a good taste

The rice and beans on the side were not good at all. The stuff in the burrito was better.

No black beans which wasn't the end of the world

Definitely more taste than Pancho villa</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Great salsas, great food. Lots of space. This place mine and my girlfriend's favorite place to go out. The menu is pretty big. Their burritos are really good and I love that they give you the option to have them be wet. The beers the have on tap also go well with the food.< /Review>

The food is simply amazing, cold drinks and fast and friendly service, their grilled chicken burritos are to die for, everything on their menu will not let you down.  Parking may be a challenge during busy time but if you can bypass that they will not let you down.<//review>

The food is great. But the people working there is awful. They are always rude and not friendly at all. If you can get pass by that the food is good if they get your order correct. The prices are good too. But for me every time I go I always have to go back because they get the orders wrong. If they had other people working there this would be a good place to eat.< /text>

Been coming here regularly. I've enjoyed different plates, they are all good 👍

Update: If you like cocktails you have to try their shrimp cocktail! The portion of shrimp is generous and it's really delicious! Last 3 times I've been here I've ordered their shrimp cocktail!</review>

So sad! They don't have the spicy tuna tacos anymore. They replaced it with Hamachi but I had it tonight and it tasted rotten! it was so dark in the restaurant so I couldn't see, ate it and hope i don't get food poisoning! The carne asada tacos are still good but sad for my fav item on the menu being gone. Probably will visit less often now.<//text>

< Review>
This is my 2nd favorite taqueria in San Mateo. Portions are a good size, prices are reasonable, and the chips and salsa bar are the best.
Last couple of times though the food was just so-so. Chicken was dry and lacking in the usual good flavor; if this continues, will have to dock it a star and move on.</Review>

Its funny how they can run ur card and say its not accepted but when ur bank says its been charged. I didnt even eat there because they tried to steal from me even after i went back and told them. I didnt go back through the doors the third time i had to send someone in because how unprofessional they are. Wish i can give them a zero : stealing is a bad way of business</Text>

<Review>Favourite taqueria in SM! Nice decor & ambiance here. Love the enchiladas plate with rice & beans. Burritos here are gigantic! Salsa/chips bar is well kept with pico de gallo & variety of spicy sauces. Kind staff.</Review><Gmap_id>0x808f9e64fb2614cf:0x82f93f5b0fc68077<//Gmap_id><date>1521252356597<//date>< pictures>

I'm not much of a food critic or a foodie. Generally I just favor a restaurant based on price and menu options. But Charlie's is one of the few places that stands out to me. Get a carne asada burrito "wet" and it is no question the best burrito I ever had.<//Review>

< Review>
Didn't get the FYI that the burrito would be wet nor was I given an option otherwise, and the sauce overwhelmed the beef flavor inside. Got the carne asada and lengua tacos, and they were fine, though not outstanding. Salsa and unlimited chips bar near the front. Horchata came in two sizes, was good. Order at the counter, optional tip bin, cash only.<//Review>

The place is kinda nice  but the environment is not really good my wife felt kinda unsafe because there is a lot of homeless people around i am sure theyre good people just looking for a place to stay but i would not recomend to bring your kids here.< /Review>

I WAS THERE AROUND 5 PM WITH A FRIEND AND WELL AT THIS TiME ITS ALREADY KIND OF DARK OUT AND WE PARKED CLOSE TO THE EXIT OF THE PARKING LOT CAUSE WE REFUSED TO GO SIT AT THE DARK BENCHES, WE WERE CHILLING OUTSIDE OF OUR CARS AND SOME CRACK HEAD LADIES KEPT COMING IN AND THEY WOULD STOP RIGHT IN FRONT OF US AND SAY SOMETHING I DIDNT REALLY PAY ATTENTION THEY WOULD GO PARK IN FRONT OF US ND THEN REVERSE ND LEAVE THEY DID THAT ABOUT 5 TIMES THE WHOLE 2 HRS THAT WE WERE THERE..  THEY WOULD GO DOWN THE BLOCK ND STOP AT THE MIDDLE OF THE ST WITH THEIR FLASHING EMERGENCY 💡  ND SHOUTING NAMES AT US ND IDK WHAT..  WE FINALLY LEFT FOR A MOMENT WE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO GET SHOT..  DEFINITELY NOT A GOOD PLACE CAUSE EVEN THOUGH U DO NOTHING AND AREN'T CAUSING PROBLEMS THOSE CRACKHEADS STAY PASSING THROUGH THERE JUST TO GET U UNCOMFORTABLE.. SHOULDN'T BE A PARK IT SHOULD BE A PLACE WITH THE NAME C.C.H CRAZY CRACK HEADS< /text>

Nothing but drugaddicts....not safe.I dont get why all the homeless drugaddicts with shopping carts and tons of blankets are allowed there!!!!Its not safe for anyone especially children. Beware!!!!Moms with small children beware,this place is not safe at all!!!!The City really needs to do something here.So sad to see the playground covered with homeless everywhere,not safe at all!!!!!< /Review>

<Text>The first question you'd ask when you come here is "why does this place even exist?", I really don't know either, I'm the first glance it looks pretty big and looks to be family friendly but the main issue is it's very dirty and it's filled with trash, homeless, and druggies, the only thing this park would be good for would be for questionable Craigslist deals.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<text>This has become a favorite park for many reasons. They have clean restrooms, with flushing toilets. Tons and tons of shade, benches  and places to lay out a blanket. It has two pirate themed play structures, fit for all ages. However, the best part of this park, is how diverse the visitors are.  Younger, older,  moms, dads, grandparents, two moms,  and every cultural background and skin color. We are here weekly and it's our 'go-to' park.<//text>< date>

This park has two softball fields, a two team horseshoe pits, swings, piriate ship play structure, a small kid play structure, shaded tables, a walking path, and lots of room to play. Great place to bring the family.</review>

<Review>Such an interesting park for the kids. They absolutely loved the pirate themed play structure and there were enough obstacles that they couldn't yet master as they're on the small side, so they're already excited to go back sometime soon. The toddler park was off limits but there was still enough to do to keep my two year old happy chasing around the bigger kids. Easily five stars even without the toddler area being accessible.<//Review><Time>1563044302087</Time><rating>5< /rating>< response>

The play structure for the older kids is a lot of fun. Two out of the three slides were too hot for my son to use today (the tube one was fine). The toddler play structure is being renovated right now (20190907) so is fenced off.  Some of the landscaping could be trimmed bit but the park certainly isn't horribly overgrown.</review>

This pirate themed park with two ships (one for the 2-5yr olds and one for the 5+yrs old) was great. The many opportunities to ascend the largest ship make this a great park to return to again and again. The large ship is in great condition. The small ship for the littles, in the sand, could use a little bit of love from the Parks and Recreation Department. Overall my just turning 3yr old begged me to promise that we would return to this park.<//text>

We had a good time at this park. I took my almost 4 and almost 2 yo boys. The pirate ship playscape is really cool, but geared towards older kids. It's 3 levels high and has a lot of physical challenges.

I think we would have enjoyed the park more if the smaller pirate ship with sand play was open. It seemed more geared towards my kids' age. It was fenced off and appeared to be in disrepair.

I will also add that all the play areas are in full sun starting at 9am in Sept. This place gets hot quick! There is a decent bathroom on site.</Text>

<Review>Great park for children under 1, toodlers, kids, and even adults! Updated and set up really great that you can see both playgrounds from the tables and the bathrooms are close. Has a huge field for baseball or other sports.

This is a fine park, with different playgrounds for different ages. Bathrooms, shaded picnic area. With a  baseball field and basketball courts I am sure this park is a local favorite.< /text>

Very clean and spacious park with baseball, basketball fields. There's also a large sectioned kids play area which is also maintained well. Benched picnic area with bbq grills are also available. A huge plus for being dog friendly (leashed).<//review>

This field was super close to where we live and I didn't even know it existed. It's in two baseball fields. Real grass and big and wide field. Really a well kept up area. We played in the winter where the tree shade kept us cold but I imagine would be fantastic during the summer months. The parking was limited but just enough for two opposing teams.< /Text>

New renovations have included more play structures for the kids. I've taken a lot of the children I baby sit, here, and they love it a lot.

Choosing between this park and Feist, Hillsborough has more to do for little kids. More variation.</text>< time>

Delicious Gelato made from scratch daily. We visited during the pandemic and they’ve taken all safety precautions. The pistachio and vanilla bean flavours were a hit. Definitely recommend.<//text>

<text>Oh man. We stopped for some Gelato because we were close and boy did we luck out! The owner / master chef behind the Gelato came out and talked about his favorite flavors / combos and was extremely nice. Every flavor we tried tasted natural and great. I got banana and chocolate mix and pictured here is the thin mint flavor. Definitely worth stopping!</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-z-1j6jwSRrQS8OimB2fmQvmoU1-NK3TFv3lQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCMzeRKB94igjvVq-6ukTgfeIE1Cvpke7mrYUN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><response>{'time': 1617408417357, 'text': 'Thank you very much for the kind words Luke.\n\nJean-Paul'}</response>< Gmap_id>

Best Gelato in town. We tried the Mango Serbet, Vanilla, Chocolate, and Oreo. Creamy and not to sweet.< /Text>

Gelato is excellent! Definitely more expensive than ice cream but it is a good place to try when in Half Moon Bay when a chain ice cream shop just won't do.  Flavors are small batch and limited.  Don't know if that's due to Covid-19 though.<//Review>

<review>Hidden gem on Correa at the end of downtown Main street in Half Moon Bay.  You can taste Gulino's passion and expertise for gelato in every bite.  His sorbet is also divine and always features fresh local organic ingredients.  We love supporting local family businesses like this.  Just go, now, before they sell out!<//review>< Pics>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>I waited two years to finally try this Gelato. After vacationing in Europe I wanted more Gelato but all we had here was ice cream.  So while wine tasting near this shop i came across the owner who my wife and I talked to and he said he was going to open up a gelato shop here. We were excited at the prospect of a gelato shop near a beach we like so we promised ourselves we would come back to try it. Fast forward two years we came to the beach with our 16 month old son and finally got to try some of the gelato.  It was really good, just like in Europe. I would really recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic gelato.</Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x808f0b4e06bc5bb7:0xcbbaff746bea1ae1</GmapID></record>

The most delightful experience in Half Moon Bay!’ On top of making just scrumptious gelato, the owner is a wonderful story teller if he has the time. We were lucky to have found this gem on our way out of town on an overcast slow day for gelato. Ended up hanging around talking with the owner for almost an hour. So much fun! Can’t wait to visit again!!! 🥰< /review>

Amazing!!! My son says the owner/maker should be on America’s Got Talent for his Gelato. He’s not kidding. It is delicious. We originally tried Almond Butter thinking we wouldn’t like it and WOW! We were wrong. It was so good!!! We went back the next day and had Banana and it may have been even better. The owner was so friendly and warm. We can’t wait to go back and try more gelato.< /text>

The owner was extremely rude to my mother daughter and myself because he couldn't comprehend the order which was a simple 4oz cup 1/2 strawberry and 1/2 biscotti and a 6oz up1/2 mix Berry 1/2 Oreo, we spoke out very clear yet he got mad at us for still buying the ice cream< /review>

The portions are exactly the same as any other ice cream or gelato shop with a similar standard in The Bay Area.  Now, rather than calling the vanilla “bad”, it would be more understandable if you said that you didn’t like it.  Many of my customers come back just for the Vanilla which is made with real Vanilla beans (extremely rare) and not concentrate or extract. My dark chocolate is made with Guittard dark chocolate from Burlingame and 100% – cocoa powder.\n\nSee above:  Just implying that saying something is «\xa0bad\xa0», is subjective, as well as judging my person.\n\nI hope to see you soon, best.\n\nJean-Paul'}</Resp><gmapID>0x808f0b4e06bc5bb7:0xcbbaff746bea1ae1<//gmapID>< Name>

Honey rosemary was very, very good; dark chocolate OK, vanilla bad. Portions are small, so I’d rather get medium or large. I’ll definitely go back to try other flavors when I re-visit Half Moon Bay.

See below: The owner is too touchy and unable to handle reviews from customers.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I have come twice now and each time I’m pleased with the gelato and the owner is super friendly.

Be sure to stop by and get yourself a great treat.<//Review>< pics>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Absolutely delicious Everytime I come here!! Totally worth it to come here and eat this homemade gelato. The owner is so nice and helpful and genuinely enjoys his customers and his work that his attitude is contagious. Sometimes you can even catch him mixing the ingredients of the flavors that he's making for the next day and as he talks about it you can tell he loves and really dedicates himself to his product and it just makes me love it all that more. Ugh can't wait to come back for his pumpkin flavors now that it's fall. Just make sure to come kinda early because he does sell out, the gelato is that good 😋</Text>< Time>

Best gelato 🍨 this is like discovering what gelato SHOULD taste like, and you can taste the freshness of the ingredients!
Favorites are: Mint, Mango, Speculoos.
My Hubby loves Chocolate, daughter loves Oreo.
So there you have it! Deserves 5 stars and the crew is always very nice!</review>

Jean-Paul’s gelato is delicious. Strawberry basil and mango mint was a perfect combination, thank you for the suggestion. He makes his batches from scratch, everyday so it’s fresh and creamy. Merci beaucoup Jean-Paul, je vous souhaite beaucoup de succès.

Happened to be in the mood for ice cream / gelato and stumbled up this little gelato spot. The owner of the shop was very friendly and gave the best recommendation. Everything in his gelato is made from scratch and the smallest size 4oz cup won't be enough after you try it :)  Splurge for the next size up!< /Review>

I believe we met Gulino, a young man from Italy. He described how he made his gelato, not ice-cream. Unlike ice-cream, gelato contains no air and therefore is much smoother and richer.
Indeed we loved his gelato- I forgot what flavours. We sat leisurely on the pavement and enjoyed it in the sunshine.
At the end we suggested to Gelino that he should place his advertisement sign board at the main street to boost sales instead of putting the gelato to waste.< /Text><Rating>5< /Rating>< gmap_id>

< review>
The ice cream is delicious. I happened to get the first scoop of freshly churned ice cream. The ladies working were not very friendly. They dropped 2 of the 4 orders we had on the floor. One the lid cracked and they simply replaced the lid. Once we reached home I noticed broken plastic in the one container. The mix is was barely mixed.
So the staff needs work. The product however was tasty aside from the plastic. Despite being in the low 40s outside the line was out the door.<//review>

One of my favorite ice cream spots in Stockton. The salted caramel with Kit Kat is my favorite go to ice cream here at Cold Stone. Customer service is always friendly and welcoming.< /Text>

<Review>I love this place. Who doesnt like custom ice cream? The young people serving are always nice. My only issue is consistency in serving size. I go in with my two kids and usualy one bowl is almost overflowing and the other is just at the rim. Sibling rivalry kicks in and momma goes crazy. Lol<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>Coffee lovers is my absolute love any day/time of the week. Happy with customer service and how hard they are at work back there. I was in line with people in front and in back of me and more walking thru the door. One of the ladies made great suggestions. The other asked if it was ok to help the next family. Courteous and friendly. Dont forget to tip these ladies most are 'starving students' paid minimum wage and love their job.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I am a big fan of Cold Stone any day. This particular day was not as inviting as the others. The customer service was spread out between employees trying to get off and some not wanting to be there. One employee that was servicing me and my kids actually took a phone call while starting my selection and then walked off to continue the call. I didn't know what to say except,  " Are they coming back to finish my order?' Another employee took over to finish my crew up. They come back to give me my total of $47.69. Ok so I ha d them a $50.00 bill. She says that they cant accept Bill's over $20. I said "Well given the total and to the fact that it was the smallest bill I had in my wallet can you accept it do to the price amount." I needed a manager to approve it as the manager saw it as I did. All of my kids as well as myself already possessed our individual ice cream cups and I wasn't a out to go and find change.  Just saying, this was not there best moment.  I left a tip anyway.< /Review>

First time there and was told it was the best. As I walked in and looked for seating all the tables were dirty. I then ordered and cleared a table for myself and family. Sat and ate for about 20 minutes. Tables were still dirty and nasty with used napkins on them. There were 3-4 workers and I'm sure one could of went out and cleaned the tables. Also a worker had friends there and she was tasting the customers (friends) drink. I believe that was unprofessional.  If the front side is dirty, who knows how dirty behind the counter is. I'm just saying.<//Text>

The employees were helpful and fast. You can get icecream cakes and ice cream cupcakes that are to die for. As with all cold stones you can get any mixture of items they have. This  place can get busy so if you know u want icecream don't second guess it just go and get your lovely desserts</text>

<rate>1< /rate><text>Horrible customer service, great ice cream not worth coming here though the girls at the front are extremely rude. My wife and I came here to get ice cream and we will not be coming back, it's worth driving to a different cold stone . Haven't had an experience that bad in a long time so I thought I would share,  if your in a good mood go to another cold stone thus place will ruin your mood with the attitudes of the girls serving you.</text>< date>

In our opinion, they are the best Chinese restaurant in town. We love the Honey Walnut Shrimp and those little won tons with cheese inside.  We usually have food delivered.  They are  always prompt and friendly.  Prices are not as high as some.<//Review>

This place has gone slowly downhill! 2-3 years ago was good and consistent. Now mostly bland and overpriced. Probably will look for a new place to order take out. Disappointing< /Review>

Absolutely horrible experience. Only one family was already there. Me and my girlfriend were really hungry, waited for about 25 minutes, only to have the servers phone ring incessantly while we tried to give our order. Before we could even finish, she left to take a phone order, and never even returned to take the rest of our order.

This place has horrid customer service, avoid like the plague.</Text>

<text>The waitress was on her phone, chitty away, and the food there was okay at best. I ordered their ribs was given five 1/8 inch wide ribs that was mostly bone! And the combination fried rice had only 3 pieces of shrimp. Not to mention she never refilled my water.<//text>< GmapID>

< Review>
I had waited thirty minutes and they called and said in order to deliver I would have to wait an additional HOUR! I live in walking distance but I could not leave the house since I have my young children with me and I didn't want to leave them in the car to go in and pay either. They were very rude when I called them to confirm that they received my online order and were rude when I explained that I would not wait an additional hour. I do not recommend this place, service was terrible!</Review>

My wife went  to this establishment  reccomend by  family. Manuel  was very nice  and helped  out my wife.  He  replaced  two tires . During conversations  with MY WIFE he asked for her number several  times and declined multiple  times he then proceeded to ask if she had a whats up app and if he could talk to her there... she again declined  and felt very uncomfortable. When it came to payment he then tried to over charge her. She disputed that she has never paid  that much for two used tires . They negotiated  price .  Then MY WIFE shocked that he then made a gesture  and said  "OR" and padded  on the couch he was sitting on next to to him as he gave her a look.  MY WIFE WAS COMPLETELY  DISGUSTED  BY WHAT HE WAS SUGGESTING  FOR HER TODO. SHE PAID HIM FOR HIS WORK AND GOT THE HELL OUT OF THERE...THIS GUY IS A REAL PIECE OF $H!t .. SO BEWARE DONT SEND YOUR WIFE , GIRLFRIEND, MOTHER , DAUGHTER  HERE...SHE'LL  PROABLY  GET HARASSED  OR SADLY SOLICITED FOR SEX!!!!</Text>

<name>John Urban</name><Text>I went here to obtain a used tire. When I showed up, I explained what I needed,  confirmed price and asked if they preferred cash. They said yes and off I went to the bank to get cash from the bank, one off of Rancho California and Ynez. When I returned,  the shop was wide open with no one in site. I walked through the shop calling out with no response. I walked the building and I returned, still no one.  I waited 10-15 minutes and still no one.

I left as a frustrated customer and saw a competitor of theirs down the street and was taken care of.</Text>< UserId.>

I was calling around for quotes on 225/40/18 everyone all quotes me $90+ for a tire. Even tire shops in big cities didn't have better deals. Manuel the owner of MMG quoted me the LOWEST out of many other locations. I highly suggest EVERYONE who lives in Temecula or Murrieta come here.< /Text>

<Review>REAL EXPERIENCE!!! I bought a tire from MMG Tires and the tire blew the same night. Took the tire back the following morning and the owner tried to tell me I must have hit a bump in the road. The tire had no signs of hitting anything it just blew. It was obviously a bad tire. The owner was very rude and spoke very little english but managed to let me know that I obviously did something wrong.

He can get any tire you want and his prices are very reasonable,
much better than Discount tires and Ramona tires, or any of the other
so called tire stores. I suggest to make an appointment so that when you
go to get your tires your in and out in no time.  If you pay in cash he will discount
you even more....< /Review>

But then he says he doesn't have the tires he said he had over the phone an hour prior! I can't stand that about used tire shops they tell you oh yeah we have them and I show up for nothing, anyways... He had some smaller tires that would fit my rim but there wasn't much tread at all so I talked him down 10$, cool now we're on the right track, or so I thought. He tells me to put my car on his lift and guides me in, my car is lower than most and him being the professional I assumed he'd know if my car would be ok since he's guiding me in? Nope my car drops onto the lift and it's way to low and the bottom of my car was touching the lift preventing me from taking the clutch out of first gear and into any other. I tell him what's going on and he just kept this "oh well" attitude about it... Then when "I" tell him to grab a jack to lift up my rear cause he had no idea what to do nor did he seem to care much, once he lifted the back my clutch freed up and I was able to move through gears... But my car was still in the life... I tried pushing but the gravel the jack was on was so crappy it didn't want to budge.... Seeing how I didn't have many options, while on the jack I put it into reverse reaaaaally slow while he dropped the jack... My pregnant wife was with me and it was my birthday what a horrible scary experience.. I don't have the money to fix my clutch if I lost my car right now it would have been all bad for my family and I'm upset he put me in that situation... I mean it was his shop and I'm the one going through his tires looking for a fit and finding a way to get my car out safely.... Where in the heck was the professionalism. My car is my baby if you can relate then you can understand my anger.... Next time I'll go across the street from mc Donald's like I have been for years for my tires...

< Review>
Went to this location, looking to transfer my family plan. The supervisor at this location had stated the plan would be $120, assuming I purchased phones. Came back the next day, explained we would be bringing our own phones, and suddenly price went up to $260. No information was collected from me, as far as personally identifiable information, so as to say the price surged due to a credit check or short credit history. I felt very discriminated against, and hope their regional manager can get the locations in this area in proper order. So glad we found another provider with excellent customer service, honesty, and transparency.</Review>

{'time': 1605735934049, 'text': 'So sorry you felt discriminated against. Are prices do change according to what phone you may be bringing in or what phone you may buy. We also are a prepaid company therefore we do NOT check credit. Which means the price quoted did simply change because you were in fact no longer bringing in your own phones like you stated. Please feel free to contact the store once more so we can help further.'}</Resp>

<text>Eli (spelling?), owner of the store was very helpful. We ran into a lot of problems trying to get my boyfriend switched over from Verizon to Boost. He tried so hard to get it all figured out while assisting other customers! It was a very stressful situation for everyone involved and he handled it very well! We ended up not being able to get the information we needed from Verizon, which meant my boyfriend couldnt keep his phone number and the phone through Boost wouldnt be free. We couldnt afford to pay full price. Eli was so kind to give us a great deal. We ended up leaving very happy. Oh and the store closes at 6:30pm Eli stayed open an extra hour or longer to help us. Amazing! I have never had any kind of issue with Boost Mobile!< /text>< pics>

This new employee they have is the nicest most helpful person I have ever dealt with I just wish I got her name to give her the recognition she deserves but she makes Boost Mobile a cellphone company worth dealing with</Review>

<response>None<//response><review>Worst customer service ever, there was an open bag of frozen montere burritos on the counter, no help was given, couldn’t help another customer either, worst employee. They should never even hired her. Will NEVER go to this store again. Very rude and disrespectful, didn’t offer to call customer service to get any help to figure out the issue. After I left I called the customer service line and they 100% helped me within 5 minutes and I was in the store for about 30 minutes and she couldn’t do anything for me nor did she care to at all, I’ve talked to this person before with issues in the past and it has been the same result, very rude, disrespectful and not helpful at all. I thought maybe her attitude would change but hasn’t and she should have no rift to be employed for a store that has to do with customer service skills</review>< pics>

<Text>YOU CROOKS. Someone fraudulently used my card with your business and instead of cancelling the charge while it was still pending your customer assistance rep lied and said they are reversing the charge. When I pointed out that he didn’t even ask for my name or my card information and my phone number is a Verizon number, he told me that a manager would be calling in 5 minutes. Surprise, surprise, no one called. I called back and explained what happened and this rep said that all I need to do is call my bank and have the card cancelled. Obviously I know this. I told her I will but I wanted to make sure the transaction was cancelled first. She said the bank will do that for me but thats not how it works. I explained that if it’s not cancelled on their end it will go through allowing the crook to benefit from boost mobile with money stolen from me and my bank will then reimburse me. I explained that she could cancel the transaction with my debit card number and the transaction number that came with the charge on my bank account but she refused. This company is as crooked as the thief that stole from me! YOU, boost mobile, stole from me! I will get my money back Monday but my bank will take the loss.

<Review>Went into Boost Mobile on Mangrove. First time ever going in. The building just reeked of old building funk. It also has the appearance of a hole in the wall. As I entered I was greeted by a young female who at first didn’t seem busy until I approached then just stared at the computer screen and rarely would make eye contact. As I started to ask just a few questions all answers were very prompt and gave me the feeling that I wasn’t welcomed. The service was about as good as the look and feel of the arrangement of the business. Another poor example of bad leadership in a business in Chico. Come to find out Boost uses Sprints towers so it wouldn’t have suited to my needs however had it fit my needs I wouldn’t have done any business with the girl working there anyways. Just not very customer oriented.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<review>Food here was pretty good. Y wife had the chopped cobb, which was okay, but the blue cheese tasted a little weird.  The chicken club I got was really good, especially with a side of their honey mustard.  It seemed like they didn't have enough staff, so the wait was a little longer than I would have liked.  Overall it is a cheap option for breakfast or lunch if you are in the downtown Napa area.</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOcqZ6TRM8fLIF853j58wThZ5SxjQ2QFO-x7DRN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Me: Oh baby! This steak, salad, onion rings, cornbread and green beans sure look good.

Wife: yeah they do. I can't wait to eat.

Me: Steak perfect. Food is so freaking good.

Wife: How about you hand over your wallet?

That's when I remembered that I'm not married and this person I've been talking to is actually a robber and here to take all my stuff. But this food is so good that I am totally disinterested in what's going on with said robber and after spacing off for a bit, thinking about what my steak could possibly be seasoned with, I came back to Earth and realized that my dog is now attacking said robber..........

Pepper is all I came up with in the end. Maaaaaaybe garlic salt. But that's because I ate this steak too fast and didn't really pay attention visually. Now I need to call the police to come clean up this robber's mess. Blood and hair everywhere.

Anyone know of a good stain remover?

Thank you for the great food Black Bear Diner< /Text>< Pics>

So I ordered DoorDash that was 60$...  two separate meals,  One with pancakes, the other with a waffle
Eggs came with both of the meals

Food was delicious

But no syrup/butter and no condiments

That would just be common sense no?

I had to wait for the hotels food service to open to Order hotel syrup lol</review>

Wait time was long, staff attribute it to COVID restrictions on indoor dining capacity, but it appeared like they were just standing around most of the time; not professional.
Food was decent, for the price. I got a waffle with fruit, and my companion had the avocado toast. They were underwhelmed with their meal, but I enjoyed my meal with a few cups of Black Bear's coffee. We both got drinks and my friend got a side of potatoes. Came out to about $30.
I imagine that if COVID were not as much of a concern, this would have been a much better experience, which is why I gave this place 3 stars. But overall, I'd recommend you go to IHOP, just across the street, unless you want a sweet cream waffle.<//text>

It's always a great experience when my friend Ron & I come to eat here. The food is very tasty & served well by Marissa & other waiters & waitresses. Our favorite drinks are firmly ensconced in our servers brains.< /text>

<review>Wow great food. One of the best breakfasts I've had, the biscuit was 6 inches tall and perfect, the chicken fried steak I cut with my fork, gravy was awesome and everything else was cooked perfectly.  On top of that service was fast and polite<//review>< Pics>

<Text>This was a terrible experience,  the food was severed cold,  the all you can eat fish, chips, coleslaw and hush puppies were a one time serving and they were out of hush puppies. I received a second order of fish to go and finally got the coleslaw to go as well. Even the normally delicious Bearclaws were sub par, no royal icing and barely any filling.  I was extremely disappointed,  normally Black Bear Diner is one of my favorites.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

This was actually one of the highlights to our Napa experience. Adorable atmosphere, friendly waitress. It was very well priced and it was the perfect, carb-y meal to start on a day of wine tastings. Large portions too. The cinnamon roll French toast was incredible.  We’ve been craving it since!<//review>

Not as corny a restaurant as the name might suggest. The waitstaff both accommodating and efficient. I had a breakfast dish,...a variation on an Eggs Benedict, sans meat. My own special request. Our Server didn’t bat an eye! Food was delicious! And the portions were quite generous. The bill wasn’t too unreasonable. The only thing that I can say, and this is common in most restaurants, I found it a bit difficult to get the attention of the wait person, once the lunch crowd arrived.<//Review>

My coffee cup had lipstick, and my plate had stains on it, from previous food because the dishes weren't washed right. BBD needs to do a better job on cleaning the dishes and the staff serving the food needs to work on their attention to detail. My hashbrowns were burnt.</Review>

<Text>A great little restaurant. They serve breakfast throughout the day as well as lunch and dinner options. There are salads available if you want to eat light or if you looking for a vegan snack and there's always highs for dessert.

Restaurants welcomes toddlers teens adults as well as aging adults it is handicapped accessible there are bathrooms for use parking is free and abundant I'm not sure if they allow service animals they're open from 6 a.m. till 10 p.m. I have found myself there on a number of occasions each time I'm greeted in a friendly manner most of them remember where I like to sit for what I like to drink I always find it clean the food cooked to order and the staff friendly.< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQkOECusplaKgi24RW2CZhH6dzE5WkK9IWmCEd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNH3FddQxmuAaN2kFVSgcXs51SVEwKmpV6vVfHg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvm-JbpG2TZUY-I7cV9XiGz0_-NUbS8EZnRlq2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPfi5gyyXEasfymfjFAXJ070rjt2BxUFwdVCtF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Response>

I always love going to the Black Bear Diner! Their portions are large and their prices are reasonable. If you're going with more than two people plan on a wait no matter when you go. If it's just you or you and one other person you can usually get immediate seating if you're willing to sit at the bar stools. In all the years I've been going to Black Bear Diner's across the state, I have never ever had a problem with their food. If you've never been you need to try them!</Text>

Ordered the fried chicken. Had way too breading and was over cooked.

Tasted like it was cooked last week and then put in the deep fryer to reheat.

Not impressed!!< /Review>

<Review>How can you go wrong for a good, big breakfast from this place.  I will say, add a little more crunch and grease to the shredded breakfast potatoes.  My go to is the country fried steak and eggs.  There is a mondo size but I would die as it is a lot of food.  Love the rye bread, nice and thick.  I'm a fan of the coffee too, nice deep robust flavor.  Comfort food at its best!<//Review>< Gmap_id>

< review>
Tried to order food for like 5 minutes, before they closed because I wanted my food to be hot and fresh when my dad went to pick it up and it was a last-minute order. But the first time I called, it kept ringing for a solid 3 minutes. The second time I called, I head a loud beep that nearly deafened me, and there was no voice on the other line. I tried to say "hello?" several times, but there was definitely no one on the line. The third time I called, they waited until 8 on the dot to pick up the phone (closing time) and said "sorry, we're closed and can't take any orders." So clearly there was someone there to pick up the phone the whole time, they just deliberately chose not to answer until after closing time so that I couldn't order dinner. It was incredibly rude, and if their staff are like that then they don't deserve your money. I would advise getting your dinner elsewhere.<//review>

Amazing staff and great food. We have been coming to Black Bear for so many years with my Papa who lives at the veterans home. We only get to see him about once a month and the routine is to go tot he Black Bear and then to see a movie! Thank you to all of the amazing staff for always remembering my family's face and especially to everyone for being so nice to my grandpa (he just loves you guys) Get the taco salad or the tri-tip dip...its huge so bring your appetite< /Review>

Black Bear Diner has been consistently one my favorite breakfast joints. Unfortunately, the service and food were horrible today. We sat at the counter and watched our food sit under the warmer for 15 minutes. A server ate a fry off a plate, and even after our breakfast was served we had to wait for eating utensils. Our food was barely warm and lacked the consistency we’ve experienced in the past.</text>

<text>My family and I went here for dinner on 8/22/19. We had the best restaurant experience eve . The staff was very professional and exceptionally friend and kind. Our waitress ( I believe her name was Luci) was the greatest waitress ever. I can't say enough heck words can't explain how awesome of a waitress and person she is. Looking forward to going back here again<//text>< pictures>

This place has a great atmosphere and aesthetic. The interior looks better than the average Black Bear Diner. The service is great, and the food is perfectly fine. However, the location of this restaurant is its biggest downfall. They are positioned right next to an IHOP, which is cheaper and not that much worse in quality. However, I would still recommend it.</Review>

We ordered online for curbside pickup.  The restaurant is understaffed and do not answer the phone so no curbside.  Potatoes were undercoked.  The rest of our meal, Bigfoot Chicken Fried Steak, was OK.
Curbside pickup should not be an online option without staffing for it.<//text>

Horrible. We arrived at 6:30pm. They said they were closing at 7 and are not seating anyone. It was Halloween and the manager was dressed in a skimpy unprofessional costume. We ordered food to go and asked 4 times for extra gravy and if mashed potatoes come with the open faced turkey. Twice the girl that took our order said it did. When we got home no potatoes or extra gravy. Apparently it's more important for them to leave early then take care of their customers. Won't go back there ever!< /Text>

< Review>
Black Bear is my favorite go to restaurant when we're on a road trip. This location disappointed both of us. We stopped in around 7 PM on a Sunday expecting the usual stellar experience we have always had at other locations. When we walked in there were several employees at the hostess area but we were not acknowledged or greeted by any of them for what seemed like an eternity. We were seated in a booth in a quiet area. Our drink order was not taken by the host who seated us as it usually is at other locations  and it was several minutes before we saw the waitress. She seemed new and quite nervous as we placed our drink order asking us if we wanted water in our iced tea then corrected herself and asked if we wanted lemon in it. Placing our food order was difficult as the first three items we chose were sold out. My GF settled for the third item on the menu that sounded good to her. I had to settle for the third item also. I don't understand a restaurant being out of signature items so early in the evening. The items were Chicken Pot pie, pot roast and onion rings. I could forgive them being out of one item but three in row is three strikes and you're out! The waitress was sweet and apologetic but poorly trained. This was truly a disappointing experience for us.  Not only was the restaurant out of the food we wanted to order but the meal I settled for was not properly prepared and very disappointing flavor wise.<//Review>

Even though you usually have a short wait for Saturday morning breakfast/brunch it is well worth the wait. I love it when we get Michelle as our waitress. She is always so up beet and kind. The food is always good and plentiful. Don't be afraid to ask for what you want even if it's not on the menu. Their French toast is amazing and they even have French toast made out of their cinnamon rolls if you really want to be sinful.  I have a noise sensitivity and am disabled, so when we go they are always kind enough to try and find us a booth that is in the corner. Enjoy!!😄< /Text>

The proportion sizes were big for when you're really hungry. The place had great customer service and one of the waiters were really nice and friendly which I like to see in any restaurant and for the food it was fast and it didn't took long to come by. I will come back and order those chicken tenders, once I come and visit Napa again.< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>Had the BIG FOOT AND PAN CAKES . The meat got thinner and the breading got thicker . The hash browns were more of a ribbon cut and a little to burnt in some spots . Other spots weren't browned at all . The grill was too hot , and we're cooked too fast . The eggs were perfect and the PAN CAKES were GREAT 👍. Server was polite and fast .  I should have gotten the ribeye dinner it's only 2 bucks more . All in all I left belly bulging feeling nice and fat . Your Friend Johnny</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Sad to say that the food here has really gone downhill over the last year or so. When you spend around $70 for breakfast for 3 people, it should be MUCH better than this! The California omelet should just be a mushroom omelet, really dry with a couple little slivers of brown avocado on top...yuck. Also, paid extra for gravy, didn't receive. We will NOT be coming here again and nor should you!< /Text>

The absolute best breakfast in Napa.  We go here almost every morning on our visits to Napa.  Great way to start the day before tasting endless amounts of wine.  I can promise you will almost never finish your entire plate.  They always make sure to give you plenty of food.  Menu is pretty large.  The pancakes are my favorite thing on the menu.  Good mimosa's too!  See you guys again soon.<//Text>

I figured they had new staff after 2 years so I thought I'd give this place another shot.

Came in by myself,. And simply only requested a table.  After waiting a half hour the waitress wanted to put me in a booth sitting in a chair in the aisle.

If you're not going to let me eat at the location you right up front so I don't have to sit around and waste my bloody time

I still recommend highly going someplace else.< /text>

This place has really gone downhill.  I got a piece of meat that was 30% fat.  I can't even believe they served it to me.

I have a pic but can't attach it with my phone.  Just nasty!!

<Review>Definitely went beyond expectations in terms of food and service. The pancakes are to die for - their recipe is seriously one of, if not, the best I've ever had - so butter and fluffy, yet creamy as well. It is easy to mess up breakfast, but they do it well here and with a smile. Love the theme of the restaurants as well and the fact they support the community and organizations, such as the National Park Service. Very cozy and enjoyable experience.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

The service was GREAT (shoutout to Tessa who served us professionally, friendly -just superb- at 11pm!
We got a lot of food for the money we paid so no complains there. However, it was very heavy and the quality could have been a tad better.
I would recommend it if you are on hungry and in need for a good feed!<//review>

<review>The portions are great especially for breakfast. Dining area is clean and  neat, They don't try to vacuum right next to you while you're eating. Staff are always greet you with a smile, on the ball with service. But my issues are small... They should open at 0500 and close at midnight (come on!) and quit changing The side dishes...I mean really who eats that much asparagus or squash, with one piece carrot or broccoli...</review>< pics>

<time>1508118825313<//time><review>I am compelled to write this.  WORST SERVICE EVER!!!

The server was very nice..  But, what's up with the dude who delivers the food?  He should be working at Domino's Pizza..

I ask the guy add some garlic bread to my order as he delivers it..  And, he laughs in my face.. I kid you not.  It was so bad, I confronted him about it.. Then I left, and didn't eat the food..< /review>< user_name>

More than usual and the waiter did an excellent job. They all seem to really want to work.

I wasn't impressed at all! I ordered a medium well classic hamburger with sweet potatoe fries, and I got, a rare hamburger with burnt sweet potatoe fries, fewer than a McDonald small order of fries! It was awful! That was the first and last time I'm going there! I only gave it two stars because at least the order was ready when we picked it up!< /Text>

<review>Didn't have the Trump tip again.  Until I said this is second time and we were going to leave.  Waiter went and asked them to cut some up for us and they did.   It wasn't exactly as rare as I like and it was chewy.  But, he did try.</review>< UserId.>

I recently went to Black Bear, and never have I gotten worse food poisoning. Got regular pancakes with scrambled eggs and fruit, came home and my gut was growling like a damned grizzly. Only reason I'm giving it two stars is because our service was good. Valentino was very pleasant and didn't just disappear as soon as you sat down.< /text>

< Review>
We had breakfast there this morning because I wanted pancakes on my birthday! My girlfriend had a dinner salad and eggs. She has not eaten since that breakfast and has food poisoning! It’s baaad! We will NEVER EAT there or any other location again. Now we are about to get on a plane and she is vomiting and has the runs.< /Review>

I passed a poster for Black Bear, they said they had a new menu.  They do and most of what changed was their prices: no surprise, they went up.  They are still one of the slowest restaurants in Napa, where waitresses walk by and purposefully ignore someone because it is not their station. I am not thinking there is anyone overseeing the place as staff wander around in pairs, talking but no one is attentive to the patrons. It was sad. So if personable service by someone is what you want: go someplace else.  It is still a ton of food for an order.  If you can make the wait.</review>

The food is reasonably priced and portions are generous. The service was subpar. Except for my toast, the food was good. My toast was served burnt. The waitress never came back to inquire if food was ok, did not ask when she picked up plates ( and uneaten burnt toast). The gentleman that took our money did not ask if food, service was ok, nor thank us for coming in.<//Text>< response>

The server was excellent the open face hot turkey sandwiche was terrible. So salty was the gravey I could feel my arteries harding lol. Sent it back brought me another plate of just turkey ...the turkey was also salty. Gave up at that point. I usually love the food there I eat all the time at the one in Vallejo.  Was not the servers fault she tried so hard to make it right even offering me different items from the menu. I could see both cook looking over at my table so at that point I was uncomfortable. I got a Black Bear Gift card for Christmas think I will use it in Vallejo.< /review>

I love the portions at black bear, i actually used a to go box and that's rare! The food was really good on my breakfaet visit. This location in napa tends to be packed most of the time. The service at the 'bar' was decent except that i was able to watch my meal sit under the heat lamp for about 5-10 minutes and we got a kick out of the tv screen that showed 0% of orders were going out on time.</Review>

The biscuits were big but tasted gross and had a wierd texture. And the hash browns were barely cooked at all. It's a shame though cause the service is always top notch.< /review>< date>

The food was over cooked and not very good. Fries were almost burnt and chicken strips dry. No dressing on Cole slaw. Fish was tough and no flavor, over cooked.  We were traveling and have come to expect consistency from the Black Bear chain, but we're very disappointed with Napa Black Bear. We will not eat there again.<//text>

Bur seriously... SO MANY F*****G BEARS.

Oh btw, they serve food. And it comes in bear size portions. The surprising thing is that it's actually really good! The vegetables (though hard to find) are fresh and flavorful, the meats are plentiful, the biscuits as large as your fist and the service is exceptional.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<rating>3< /rating><text>Usually my favorite place to eat. However I was very disappointed with the slow service on our last visit.  After our food was brought out our server took what seemed like forever to check up on us.  I ordered the all you can eat fish fry.  By the time she came to check on us our whole table was completely done eating. I wanted a second serving of fish, only to be left waiting longer to finally have the manager come over 5 minutes later to tell me they ran out. Really?  We were seated before 7pm. All I'm saying is that if you can't keep up with the demand for a promotion that you are putting on then end the promotion.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Honestly, we were in Buttercream's parking lot -- which didn't have a stall to park in ..so we ended up here.
Party of 3 -- around 11 in the morning .. about a 20 minute wait she says.  I'm telling you, it was packed!  And it was a Saturday haha.  They didn't take longer than maybe 10 minutes -- super quick for them.  We was hangry too.  So hangry my son didn't order from the kids' menu AND he ate all his food.  That almost never happens.  The man had an omelette and one waffle.  The kid had chocolate chip pancakes (2), 2 over easy eggs and bacon.  I had my usual chicken fried steak and eggs with their hash.  We were very pleased .. with the food and the service.  Will we come back?  Heck yes!!</Review><user_id>101949640776967591916</user_id><Rate>3<//Rate><Date>1520542171857</Date>< Name>

This place is terrible, service is too slow, waitress was kind of rude, food was lacking on flavor and poor technique. You can see there are not very capable cooks in  that place. We had to wait a lot for a table and it wasn't worth it at all. Not going back ever. First and last.</Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>4 of 5 stars to the Black Bear Diner on Soscol Ave in Napa, CA. I've been to several Black Bear Diner's and so my comment will reflect the others also. BBD is a great place for a great big meal! Each has a somewhat unique atmosphere with plenty of black bears about to keep you company. BBD is great for breakfast and I highly recommend "Bruce's Meat Lover Omelet". For dinner I suggest you be very very hungry and go for a "Bob's Big Bear Burger". I do highly recommend Black Bear Diner.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<text>I chose a date it been about 2 years. I’m on oxygen and have other problems and I want to order food delivered in Napa, Ca
only they do not deliver food. I tried Grubhub and Eat.24 and they will not either. There are senior citizens in Napa so you would pick up a lot of business.<//text>< pictures>

Worst experience in my life.  Food was cold , ordered then was told was out of the product i requested then I reorder to be told ten min later they ran out of that too. When i finally reserved my food it was cold i asked for it mid rair . Yet it looked as tasted a if my food was sitting on counter for several hours. Was rubber and rough  Even after i made my complaint to the one in charge all i got was a I'm sorry several times with no resolution.  Bad food,  dirty bathroom no tp. Orders where plated with the wrong idioms and had to be replated all they did was scrape from one plate to the other for my company and I  .  I was completely appoled on how this place was ran.  Pore food and pore management.  Do not go here unless you want to have a bad day.<//review>

No discount was given and I paid full price.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x8085060e6ab52965:0x5c46475997b07c31</Gmap_id></record>

Extensive menu for breakfast, lunch & dinner.  Food is definitely a few steps above Denny's, IHOP, & other diner style locations.  Price is reasonable.  Cozy environment.< /Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) I have been to that place 2 times and the first time they gave us a table but they took a long time to attend us, in the end we left the place and no one ever came to take the order, the second time it was worse we were just standing at the entrance waiting to be served , they only looked at us but nobody attended us and the place was little crowded 😒 bad experience
