<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Phenomenal customer service and treatment center. I usually don’t leave reviews for businesses unless they do an over-the-top job . I came to Sherman oaks Prolase a few years ago  after having a terrible laser experience at Newlook (very rude/uneducated staff and lasers that didn’t work on me... they would make my hair turn darker and longer AFTER treatment- and yes I have light skin composure w dark hair). I decided to switch over to Prolase and have been going there ever since. Staff has always accommodated me whether I needed a last minute appointment change or cancellations, taking me even when I have come in late, super genuinely friendly staff that makes you feel comfortable throughout your whole process, well-educated nurses and not to mention great laser results! I no longer need to shave/wax/bleach my hair, 0 laser treatment incidents and feel so much more confident with my body now. Choose Prolase and you won’t be disappointed!
Thank you so much Prolase staff!<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

I wish i could give them 0 star, it took 45 minutes to make an appointment with them! Then few days before my appt they called and said technician will not be there so they rescheduled me and I never ever received their call or text for confirmation! Since i was unhappy with their customer service i dudnt show up and they charged me $22.5 for no show! I never gave them my credit card info for appt! They just kept it in their system without my permission! I never suggest them! They recently become too busy and they dont care to clients! They want to make money in any f* ways they can!</Text>

Isadora is the best nurse you could ever ask for. She is very knowledgeable, patient and takes her time to provide a perfect laser treatment. The office is clean and there is no waste time for when it’s your appointment.</Review>

First time having laser hair removal done. Great experience here, with very nice and helpful staff. Would definitely recommend checking them out here! Always seem to have some good appointments available based on my schedule, which will really love. They are even around on Sundays! Considering having some other areas done in the future. Be sure to check out their package pricing if you need some treatments and want to save some cash.< /Text>

<text>I will be honest everybody results is different. This was my sixth visit every time I had a different nurse but today I had a person that deserves recognition. Her name is Caresse. Caresse goes beyond her Duty and what I mean by that is number one she reviewed very carefully my previous treatments. Number to she's been decent amount of time asking me what kind of results I am looking for. Number three she went to consult with another nurse how much she can increase the settings on a laser. Number four she was constantly asking and make sure that I'm comfortable with the new settings. After all she's very caring very compassionate employee she deserves recognition she really likes what she does. She communicates very clearly with the patients. she always ask if you are comfortable and if there is anything else she can do for you.</text>< gmapID>

<Review>My experience covers both locations in Glendale and Sherman oaks. I’m very happy with the results I had for the Botox treatment and my partner had the cool-sculpting.
The front desk people were extremely friendly especially Dolores, and when I was signing up for a package, Tony the manager was professional knowledgeable and gave us the best packages, then he helped us signing up for rewards programs. Moving on to the treatment part of the experience, Ramak was sweet professional and took the time to evaluate the areas to be treated and made sure we are comfortable. I met many injectors, but she is by far the best of the best. Her hand was light and steady.
I can’t thank you enough for the great experience and looking forward for future treatments.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Name>C Vasoyan<//Name><Review>The CONS & PROS:
First, parking is a CHALLENGE at this location.

Secondly, today wasn't a pleasant day at Prolase. I was getting a discount package deal completed and honestly it took 27+ minutes. It frustrated me, so I stated that they should make a suggestion to those who can make a change with their system and they (both receptionist) said that's the way it is and it can't be changed...WOW (Program the system to do two items, on a single transaction; what a concept.🤔)  They did one transaction at a time with separate charges. It transaction took around 15 minutes.
Ladies don't get upset when somebody gives you their opinion or suggestions, it has nothing to do with you personally, it's not your fault.
Patronize your clients and possibly state something like "I will certainly pass on your suggestion on but sadly, as for now; there's nothing I can do."

PROS: Laser really works their "Nurses" are fabulous and professional. I'll still keep going to this location because all in all I like the service. I'll just keep my month closed.< /Review><user>105860084994441123167<//user>< Time>

I was told I would see immediate results. Instead of widening my face, my cheekbones were made higher resulting in my cheeks appearing sunken in. A few days following my appointment, I called Prolase to express how upset I was with the way I looked. An appointment was made for me to see Dr Karo in the Glendale
office on June 13, 2019. Instead of fixing the problem, he told me that all the models want high cheekbones and sculptured cheeks. What do models have to do with what I want? I want a fuller face, and that's not what I got.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

I had told the workers i would want a discount on my next appointment instead these people thought that it would be better to get a angry customer moreee angry they go and give my money back and tell me to go to another laser clinic. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!! If women have to go through this just for a laser treatment that is very sad! I used to go to NEW LOOK SKIN CENTER and they were GREAT at the work they do I WOULD RECOMMEND GOING TO NEW LOOK CENTER THEY OFFER GREAT SERVICE AND QUALITY WORK!!<//Review>< user_name>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>I've had 3 session with my nurse Hedieh at Prolase now and she has been wonderful. I would highly recommend requesting her when setting up your appointment. She makes you feel totally comfortable throughout the process, she keeps you engaged in conversation, and she is very meticulous with her work. Most of my friends who have lasered with different companies in the past have all told me how awfully painful there experiences were, but I personally never feel any pain at all. I'm sure this has a lot to do with finding the right location with the right equipment, and the right person who knows what they are doing.< /review>< pics>

I had a great experience here, I purchased 3 packages of 3 different areas, each for 6 visits, I am now done with all 3 and I plan to return for others areas and return for upkeep in the already lasered areas.Look out for great monthly specials and lock them down by purchasing few sessions. This was a great investment!!! I am very sensitive to the touch of a raiser, nothing had helped before, it is so amazing not to shave for weeks and weeks! amazing results! word of advice, the better you deal with pain, the higher you can go on the machine and the better results you will see (I am lucky to have a high tolerance to pain, but honestly it is not that back atttt alll!)</review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

<Text>Googled for a Mexican meat market and found this place. All these years in Glendale and we didn't know it existed. The people are very friendly, lots of products from the typical Mexican staple foods to household products. The meat looks fresh and the prices are good. I love supporting these type of places. ✊🏽< /Text><name>Diana Rodriguez< /name><Rating>5< /Rating><resp>None</resp></record></dataset><record>

Trate de ser lo más amable que pude. Antes de despedirme.  No me viera gustado perder su amistad. Pero. Ella no le interesa. Quiere obligar alas personas usar mascarillas.  Nadie me puede obligar a algo que no quiero. Bye<//Review>

Expecting for them to fix it that same day. Waited an hour and a half after my x-ray examination just for them to tell me nothing will be happening to fix my problem and wanted to schedule me on "another day". Their reason: specialist only comes in twice a month, on weekends only. WHAT AN INCONVENIENCE. Sitting there wasting my time for 90 minutes FOR NOTHING. I walked right out.. called my insurance and requested to switch dental providers ASAP! Also switching dental providers for my child. Also, they assumed I came in a car and said wait outside in my car, AFTER examining my State ID, clearly not a driver's license.. I felt a sense of negligence and condescending rudeness.  DON'T COME HERE. DON'T BRING FAMILY HERE. STAFF IS PLAIN RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL.</Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

people here wants to get paid by insuarance doing everything they can to not work.  even down to their supervisor.  place was empty not business.  they didnt even try to help me out and rather have me wait 2 months if i wanted their service. shady health care workers.  wants to get paid by insurance without helping people.< /Review><GmapID>0x80dd4a6e614e5073:0x1f1d497425f6de12<//GmapID><user_name>Jae Ko<//user_name><time>1597869608751</time><user>115595350102719738587</user>< response>

Wait time is absolutely ridiculous here. It’s no reason a person should have to wait over an hour if their appointment is booked at 8am. I’m supposed to be the first one seen. I’m not sure if it’s the staff running late or what but this location is the worst.<//review>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>The wait is horrible It looks as they booked soo many patients @ the same time. The room was full with patients horrible even more with the pandemic going on very inconsiderate of Western Dental. They have only a few chairs available to sit 7 to be exact you would think they are respecting the social distancing but wait we are a total of 17 persons in the room. Dont know how they book but they are calling other kids that came way after my son I complained and they said you will be called shortly, ugh very disappointed.
**patients keep coming in...</review>< Pictures>

Nice clean office. The lab tech, receptionist were polite. The doctor was nice and easy to understand treatment plan. My only disappointment was either the total cost. Very expensive recommended treatment plan.< /Review>

I supposedly had implants done and was told that I would be so satisfied with there work. WRONG!!!!!!  I’m paying out of my pocket and I do have ins. But they won’t see me, cause I have HMO, what is the difference, ins is ins. Well now my implant don’t stay on, have to use glue and gums where the metals are hurts so bad. Not only I have $15,000 bill to pay, the last time I was there they needed to put a part in and I had to pay $170. And it fell out and they don’t want to see me cause I don’t have the right insurance. They saw me before with the ins I had HMO. I do not recommend this place to know body!!!!  Oh, if you don’t pay your bill, they make so many calls to collect there money but to finish the work  they start they turn there backs and say I have to go somewhere else and pay some more to another dentist to finish someone else’s job. They are rude, unprofessional, etc!!!!!  I should not even give them one star but I needed to make a review on this!!!!!< /Review>

DO NOT BEING YOUR CHILDREN HERE. AVOID THIS PLACE ALTOGETHER. DON'T PAY THEM ANYTHING! THEY TELL YOU ITEMS ARE NOT COVERED, WHEN THEY ARE. I checked with my insurance and they covered what Western Dental wanted to charge me $8,000 for!!!  If you have had work done, check with your insurance and if they cover it, SUE THEM for your money back!<//review>

They recommended  unnecessary expensive services that insurance doesn’t cover. Also, they can’t keep their appointments straight. Several times, I made appointments and got calls saying that the particular specialist who had to do the procedure didn’t work on the day they had set for me. That said, the work they did do was good, the staff was friendly, the facilities were clean and convenient.< /text>

<review>DO NOT GO HERE. Dentists are only available ONCE A MONTH!!  It would have been nice if this was made clear to me, as I WOULD NOT have chosen Western Dental. Maria Lopez has NO CLUE about Customer Service, and there is no one for her to have to answer to, so, she does and says whatever she wants, and changes the story later based on what's beneficial for her. She tries to force you to pay for unnecessary services- it is NOT proper etiquette to force a patient to make decisions while they are sitting in the chair in the middle of a procedure and then state that the dentist may not have time to perform the procedure because so much time was taken to explain things. It is NOT the patient's fault if the Dentist, Dr. Lee, is she lacks the appropriate communication skills, and if you feel uncomfortable with anything she gets defensive and this is what Dr. Lee said to me, "I'm the doctor, what I say, goes, and if you don't agree or don't feel comfortable with anything, there's nothing I can do for you.
Luckily, Dr. Avi saw me, and agreed that the two implants Dr. Lee installed were in fact failing and needed to be removed.  He said that he would oversee the removal of the two failing ones and implanting two replacement ones, this time, hopefully, correctly placed. As per a set of dentures, it has been a year, and FOUR sets later, and they still have yet to produce a functional and cosmetically appealing set. I was in for yet another fitting, and this time at the end of my appointment, Maria stepped in and said, "I will handle her appointment set up," to which she commented something to the affect of, "complete this procedure . . . ."  I certainly hope that she doesn't think that this is my final appointment in regards to implants. The original placement required several follow-up appointments just to check on the healing process alone, not to mention several fitting and adjustment appointments for my prosthetics. I just get a sinking feeling that Maria wants to just get rid of me as soon as possible. Trust me, I want this over with, too, but I WILL NOT be allowed to be operated on and not receive the proper post/follow-up care!!  COMPLETE INCOMPETENCE, NEVER GO HERE!!<//review><Name>M</Name><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< user>

<text>we had a horrible experience on western dental on PCH Lomita CA
today
They hiring  very low profile middle stern  dentists to perform procedures.
The dentist does not  know how to behave with patients.
they use low quality dental filling material so that is last for few months and the patient should return for second filling.
please do not use this place for your dental care.< /text><gmapID>0x80dd4a6e614e5073:0x1f1d497425f6de12< /gmapID>< Time>

<Text>My 9 year son couldn't have his cavity treatment despite our three visits.
1. First visit was only for X-ray. Doctor did not have enough time.
2. Second visit was only for cleaning. We needs a child specialist.
3. Third visit, doctor didn't give any words to my son for local anesthesia and my son almost ate the toxic! We had to return home.

I'm  so done with this place, too.
No need to talk about an hour waiting time.

i have to agree with the many negative reviews posted. please be overly and extremely cautious, review all dental cost with your insurance company before any procedure; additionally, compare the western dental cost with another local dentist. i have no opposition to the dental office chain attempting to be profitable; but, the practice here is just immorally greedy. western dental is a dental office factory with numerous dentists and dental chairs churning out patients as quickly as possible. heed the warning: caveat emptor... buyer beware!<//text>

As always, amazing care at this office! Dr.Pandya is exceptional in her specialty. She is wonderfully upbeat and genuinely caring. That is important in a medical field such as dentistry. Arsenio is precise and is great at impressions. Jeanette is a thorough hygienist and a pleasure to be around! Sandra and Jovan always greet you with a smile.

<Text>Lied about a periodontal disease to try and upsell a $1000 deep cleaning. Said they would provide a routine cleaning if i signed a waiver but only provided a 1 step polish. a routine cleaning has 5 steps. they preformed 1 out of 5. Leaving out the scaling and flossing. they said they cannot preform the scaling or flossing steps because they recommended the $1000 quadrant deep clean and i refused. The first time i went to this dentist they were great and preformed a routine cleaning but that was only because i told them about having my teeth cleaned 3 months prior. if they find out its been 6 months since youve had a cleaning they will automatically upsell a $1000 deep clean, its standard business procedure for corporate dental offices like this and its happend many times. i will go to a new dentist, tell them its beem 3 months since my last cleaning and they will provide a routine cleaning.

< review>
This place is for sure a "wholesale" dentistry where the main objective it is not to provide good customer, professional service but to take as many patients as possible, and make a lot of money in a short period of time. Their focus is not "quality" but "quantity". The "socalled manager" is totally unprofessional and doesnt have a clue what it takes to be a professional, or provide good customer service. I made an appointment for my son for a simple cleaning and possible braces. I arrived early and waited more than half an hour, when i submitted my forms i was told the dentist might not be able to do the cleaning cause didnt have time, very professional! so what was the purpose of making an appointment then? They made me waste my time, and the socalled manager instead of apologizing and trying to accommodate me since i have made an appointment for cleaning she was ironic and told me simply "if you arent happy with the service, you are welcome to go someplace else, have a good day!" Very, very professional! this is a total lack of respect with a patient and its time. I sat right there in their waiting room and filed a formal complain with my insurance company and since i wanted to talk to the "so called manager " and she just ignored me i have to write a note to her suggesting they focus more on quality than quantity. Do not go to this wholesale places, choose a facility where their practice is small, read reviews, do your homework, etc. You are paying good money for your insurance and deserved good quality service!<//review>

< Review>
This place is unprofessional and should be shut down.
They are rude and unhelpful.
I went in on my first time to get an evaluation and the Dentist didn’t even speak to me and instead was ignoring me and talking to the assistants.
I went in for my Wisdom Tooth Extraction and my appointment time came up and told me there are 3 people ahead of me and their backed up.
I’ve had my wisdom teeth pulled out before and it takes under 30 minutes. So I left and will never go back.
I’m so happy I never let them actually operate on my teeth because I could tell it would have been painful.<//Review>

I’m a 15 year old girl with braces. I was scheduled for a dental cleaning at 8 am and 2 hours later they finally cleaned my teeth, which ONLY took about 10 minutes.  Before that, one of the dentists was removing my bands to take off my wires and ended up poking my lip with the tool. My lip started to bleed. Now I’m waiting even more for them to just put my wires back on and I know for a fact it only takes them about 5 minutes to do so. The service is terrible and the staff is rude. If I had a choice I’d give this place no stars.< /Review>

<text>My family had booked an appointment for today and received a confirmation text that all is well and ready for us to be seen. My mum uber’s in to the clinic, only to get told that the dentist is not in and is only in the office on Mondays?? Once asked why they did not let us know prior, they say that they don’t have control of letting us know, as it is a remote message sent to us. So who’s job is it to tell the customer that they can’t be seen????</text></record></dataset><record>

< review>
I've been here quite a bit for crown work with Dr. Moeller, and he and his staff have been really great in managing my case and following up on my overall dental health to make sure I was doing well. The front desk staff were also always helpful and polite, like helping me modify my treatment plan when I got a referral to an endodontist for a fused molar root canal.

Besides the compassionate treatment I've been given, this office also provides emergency dental care - I was seen on short notice for a broken temporary with no hassle. There can be some times where you can wait a bit to be seen, but if you're waiting it's likely because you're either there on Saturday (it gets busy!) or there's someone in an emergency in front of you.

And if you're complaining about the cost.... dental care is expensive pretty much everywhere, even with insurance! I got great care and I'll come back for more great care again.</review>

<Review>I scheduled my daughters to have some work done, I had the scheduled together to avoid having to wait a long time and I have been here waiting 2 1/2 hours and counting and they still have not called my other daughter. It is not a good experience to have to sit in the lobby with one daughter who just had a tooth taken out and in pain and the other who is falling asIeep. Now I have to wait another hour or so until they decide to call daughter. When I asked why I have to wait so long the girl says because the dentist is over booked. I wish they would have said something before. Please think twice about coming to this place. Unless you don’t mind wasting your whole night.<//Review>< Pics>

Warning WESTERN DENTAL HAS AN "F" WITH THE BETTER BUSSINESS BUREAU stay away from them.

There customer service representative are very rude, one cursed me out and hung up on me. With another leaving me on hold for over a hour and never coming back with a SUPERVISOR like I asked And another told me to take my 12 year old to the hospital with a prescription for pain pills. Really great advise expecially in the opiate epidemic our society is in great advice!!!
My daughter is in a lot of pain due to the placement of the braces and one of her adult tooth is now lose due to the braces being to tight. Yet, the orthodontist is in only one day a week so we have no one that can help her. They said they would charge my insurance but could not do so to Monday (We went in on a Saturday) so I put it on my credit card now they refuse to charge my insurance and credit my credit card. I have no idea how we in Lomita allow them to be in the city this CORPERATION is poorly ran, they lack customer service skills.
If you Don't believe me look it up under the Better Business Bureau.
Only have it a start becuase I had to.

Dont take your kids here!!!<//text>

It's the worst service I've had. the manager is so unxperienced. I've had so many issues with them since 2016 up until today my bridge is not fixed. They sure did charge the insurance but haven't done their job, unfortunate I had to send everything to the department of dental board and hope this to be finalized.
👎👎👎👎👎to me l not recommended.

If you can't open when you're suppose to, then why schedule appointments for 9am? Oh I know why, you think people will just keep coming back. Well if this is how you treat your patient's it speaks volumes for the wkrk you must perform on them. You're in the business of taking care of people not neglecting them. Shame on you!

This company is less than professional in all areas, on all levels.  My son has been a patient at the Lomita office for more than 3 years, now all of a sudden they cannot find his insurance coverage information??? I am just trying to make an appointment and the lady on the phone wants to ask me 25 unnecessary questions because her training was inadequate.  This makes no sense, just make the damn appointment already.  I was hesitant to call them and now I see why.  And the service at the Lomita office is terrible.  There is an additional 60 minute wait when you have an appointment.  They are always over scheduled and under staffed.  I am so done with this place.  It is a disgrace to the dental industry.  DONT GO HERE FOR ANYTHING!!!< /review>

Zero stars. CLEAN YOUR DOOR. (it's probably still unsightly dirty) I wanted to utilize my medi-cal coverage since I got off my other insurance.
Most horrifying experience at a dentist. I went in for a cleaning as a new patient.. 2 people in there, took 2.5 hours to get x-rays done -ok whatever. The dentist lady, was the least compassionate person, didn't say anything to me for about 5 minutes as she stood there, told me I had 2 cavities, and needed a root canal. I had been very stressed the month prior recovering a torn meniscus, so it reflected in my teeth. Made me feel extremely uncomfortable. I scheduled a cleaning for the next day despite the weird feeling everyone gave me, they pushed a filling, which I scheduled but backed out of last minute. The next day for my cleaning they seemed to be mad that I made the decision to back out of the filling, even after telling them I had a motocross race the next day and I didn't feel okay with having tender teeth for, since I clench. Long story short, the dentist said nothing to me during the cleaning, clearly mad, the assistant literally choked me with the spit sucker. She grinded my teeth in all of about 2 minutes which hurt like hell, didn't try to avoid my gums. I was squirming and she never asked if I was alright. When she finished she just walked away and didn't say anything leaving the assistant with me. I literally shed a tear because I couldn't breathe with the spit sucker down my throat, and I even gagged a couple times. After that, the assistant put thick fluoride gel on my teeth, which I don't use fluoride because it's TOXIC and I'm allergic and sensitive to chemicals. It's been about a month and she grinded my back tooth into a sharp edge which has caused me pain and more problems. Since the fluoride treatment, my gums have been hurting and my teeth are ultra sensitive. I had to call my old dentist, and will gladly pay the fee to see them. They are even giving me a discount after hearing about my experience with these quacks. Please don't bring your children here. This place is unprofessional and dirty.
Show some compassion to your patients! Though, I will never come back here again. It wasn't worth a free cleaning from my insurance. :(< /text>

It took 1 1/2 hrs. to be seen by dentist. She told me it would be another 45 min. to clean my teeth. I was shocked and complained to her regarding the scheduling. In defense, she casually stated that the corporate assigns appts. all day and the dentists are to take on the appts. in the order/timeliness that are "priority work" (my words). All others are to be shuffled in as time permits.
The worst policy I've ever heard of and the dentist was unapologetic for any misunderstanding. She kept insisting that this is a corporation as if this is normal procedure dental/patient care.
Please define "patient CARE" or "customer SERVICE" to me in view of this policy of appt. scheduling. In other words: what makes Western Dental anything but a "mill"- a large-scale commercial operation where profit is placed above the well-being of people?</Text>

< Review>
I am also a victim of Western Dental in Lomita Branch, On July 7, 2017 for tooth cleaning, a lady came to me to sign a forms and she didn't give me a chance to read it and when I came home to read it the toothbrush kit they gave me it cost me $205.50 I thought it was a compliment. The dentist charge me of $1,431.00 and she don't even tell me what it's been done. Never introduce herself, don't even tell me if something wrong with my teeth I also asked her if she can unjust my upper partial teeth because it's kind of loose and she said she don't want to be responsible if she breaks it Front desk is terrible so rude. I really don't recommend Western Dental.</Review>

<Review>*going on month 4 and endless calls I shouldn't have to make to smt and this location and I STILL haven't received my refund, western gives every excuse in the book to not repay YOUR money* *its been 3 months and a month since posting on here, and I still havent received my refund for work that was never done, but yes of course they'll give the run around! Sick of calling sick of forcing these IDIOTS to do their job*   Please take my advice and don't come here, I went to have a root pulled from my gums and left with a fractured jaw and a severe infection. The oral surgeon was rough and the staff is rude and unhelpful! You truly leave in more pain than you came with. Wait times are terrible. I got conned into signing contract with them just to have a root pulled that insurance covered but not a root canal I needed, the female dentist that works there (brown hair-white) was helpful when I first went in; then she started getting ruder and ruder every time I told her how much pain I was in, seemed like she just didn't want to help. The place has no privacy at all, and they kept bringing up my medical history, pain meds I've been given which made me feel very uncomfortable if I am in pain because of their work they should be able to do more to help that! There is always a waiting room full of people in pain and crying with a staff that's always gossiping and looking at you in disgust when you ask how much longer it'll be after waiting hours (with an appointment)! I'm shocked that this place hasn't been shut down by now and with all these complaints. Trust me when I say there are better dentists around and you just shouldn't risk your health dealing with these dentists.< /Review>< GmapID>

<Text>No benches or restroom. Benches are behind a locked gate so you have to stand while waiting. The security gaurds will leave you alone as long as you don't cause any problems though so it is a safe place to smoke and there is shade to wait under. Has a vending machine with cold drinks and a snack shop, but it is often closed.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80c25ac7f1a6e159:0xccfa9284741e893b<//gmap_id><rate>3< /rate>< date>

<text>There is a Snack Bar with a variety of liquid refreshments.
The Proprietor is a very kind and friendly gentleman!!!
The bathrooms are sorta nasty but what do you expect?!?!?!
You have to get a token from The Armed Security Guards!
There is a covered area to wait for The MetroLink, with Heaters that I do not know if they actually function.
The Hood is a bit sketchy... do NOT leave anything unattended!!!
The LA Sheriff’s Station is a couple of blocks North, so I would assume the Trouble Makers realize that and act accordingly!<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>The staff is very friendly and helpful, however there are a LOT of weirdos that hang out there and homeless people on loud speakers and stereos blasting their music. But they do have a "Snack Shack" that's open during the week days, so that's a HUGE PLUS in my book!<//Text>< Gmap_id>

So they need a place safe so I find it's a 1-10 scale I gave it a 9 rating on how safe it is to arrive at our local Transit Station, it needs a bit more for a 10 or a 5 Star Rating.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

That picture is not from the Lancaster station , the Lancaster station has a very small waiting room or lobby, one restroom very dury , the only good thing about it I think , is the snack shack, I can get a hot coffee , or hamburger they have a real person , attending you , and I can get a good sit ,on the train</review>

This is my favorite little juice spot after a morning workout in South Orange County. Yes, it is fairly corporatized, but they serve a mean strawberry surf rider with extra lime and vitamins that is very refreshing in the desert summer sun. If I am working out in South Orange County, then this spot is definitely a tasty treat for cool down. When you truly find things that you love, making a routine out of them is never boring. Routines built on love seem to last. Your life and light shines bright, even on a day when things don't go smoothly. Enjoy your Jamba!< /Review>

I ordered doordash from this location. My order was a Pitaya Bowl. Apparently they were out of banana, but I was never called and made aware of this, or asked if I would like to exchange it for a different fruit, or offered a refund for my order. They wrote a note in sharpie on my lid that they had added extra strawberries, which I never asked for. Very unprofessional.<//Review>

So slow and so smelling. Also no hygiene here. No gloves no washing hands in between handling money and making food. Gross. Their ac vents are gross as well as floor.  Gobs of grossness along wall and floor. Did I mention how bad it smells< /text>

<review>The smoothies are delicious and the oatmeal is super tasty especially since you can customize it to your likings. The reason why the 2 star is because within my last 3 visits 2 out of the 3 times something has gone wrong. The first time they never received my order that I made online, so had to wait extra while it was made. The 3rd time which was my last time I placed another online order which is how I normally order. I got there and my smoothie was there but they had no oatmeal. Ok so I asked for a refund something that couldn't be done because I ordered it online. They never offerred to give me something else in its place. They reached out to their manager and the manager didn't know how to refund an online order. They mentioned that they would get back to me and never did. I stated in the note my information that if they were able to refund it or not it was okay but I still expected some sort of call to at least let me know the outcome. The staff is great but their ordering system not so much that's the reason for the low score maybe they should also have some kind of protocol for when situations like this happen especially when they're so rare from what it looks like.< /review><user>100768367361099147817<//user>< Pictures>

I love Jamba juice but I can't believe how expensive it has gotten lately! I mean I ordered two drinks and it cost me almost $13.00!!  I didn't even add anything extra to it either. No powders or boost's. I couldn't believe it! It's a bit expensive for juice in my opinion!!</review>

I've never had a bad juice here.  Its not the healthiest in my opinion becauase its loaded with sugar but taste very good.  They have lots of options and I have tried almost all of them.</Review>

Also one time I ordered a ice cream thing and they gave me a spoon.  A FREAKING SPOON. I asked for a straw and they said no because you can't drink it through a straw. So I stole a spoon and the money at them and ran and now, I use uber eats to get all my jamba juice straws< /text>< Pics>

Just came for drinks. I recommend the Irish Mule. Very tasty. Right now seating is all outside and to get a table you have to order an entre. We were provided with stools since we were not eating. Worked well< /Review>

< Review>
No disrespect to the the door guy seems like he has a miserable life. Was there for the fight and was respectful when he said it was full and was waiting for people to leave. After a few parties left, still made myself and another girl wait in the rain when it had way more room to occupy us. He also went out of his way to cover the screens from the door instead of having the respect of people waiting outside in the rain to see the fight. Seems like a nice spot. Door man needs to be retrained. Power trip or just having a bad day I think I have nothing against him personally but having people wait outside when there was lots of room for another party of 8+. When there are people waiting outside that was already inside and need to reconnect with their friends accommodate them. Good luck to you and your business.<//Review>

Great neighborhood sports bar. Can get crowded on weekends during college/NFL football games. Friendly staff, great location for watching any/all sporting events. No food is served in the bar, but there are plenty of local options for take-out.< /text>

Great joint for watching any type of sports. Bring in outside food if you want. Friendly staff, mix of neighborhood locals and folks from other neighborhoods.</Review>

Yesterday my friend and I happened upon this establishment after her fantastic hair appointment.   Kieran the bartender was more than charming and made it the end to a perfect day.  Kieran, if you read this we were the two gals that ordered Titos martinis (cause you had no Kettle one)  cant wsit to go back to this jewel on Haight.<//Text>

<text>My father and I showed up at 330pm looking for a few good drinks and a cool bartender, but instead not one employee was insight-- an electrician had to get one from the back. When we asked if it was open he said "I guess so". I suggest walking right back out of the bar if the bartender is an old, gray haired, frail man</text>< time>

<Text>Fun place to watch a game (it's known for soccer but any big game is fun). Crowd can be hit or miss (read: sometimes douchey) but the bartenders are always friendly and fair. I've seen a bartender diffuse some heated situations with grace and kindness while still being firm.<//Text>< pics>

An excellent place to watch early morning Premier League games. There are normally about 10-15 his there on Saturday and Sunday mornings. A good crew but not so big that it's overly loud.<//Review>

A well lit, smallish Irish bar is a nice neighborhood where they’ll quickly learn your name and favorite drink. It’s usually not too busy, which makes it a nice place to unwind with friends after a long Friday. But if you come during one of the popular game days, there could be a line well out of the door.< /text>

<pictures>None<//pictures><Text>Fun outpost in the Haight for the Brainstormer trivia empire!

We showed up at 7:15  for the 8 pm trivia night on Wednesday and were able to score a little side table for four.

Standard Irish pub beers ($5) like Smithwicks and Guinness. And since they serve no food (they do sell some chips), patrons know to bring in Rosamunde sausages and pizza from down the street.<//Text><Resp>None</Resp><rating>4<//rating><user>114423743672147906343</user>< Date>

I'd give you a higher score,but someone there is getting people's debit and credit card info and attempting to make withdrawals.Do not use your cards there someone is running scams there.Its happened to me 3 times now this year.Someone tried today and I had to lock my card.About to get police involved.If you can investigate that and resolve that.< /review>

They have 6 pumps and are usually rather busy. It's located on the corner of Limonite and Etiwanda and can often be a hassle to get out of.< /Text>

SO much to see and you will still miss something. We were looking for old doors to make into a barn door. Searched the stacks and found some old apartment doors, some still with tenants names & numbers and stickers on them. So cool. Prices were good. These doors fit EXACTLY into my vehicle for the 1-hour drive home. Perfect! So thankful we found this place as we had been looking forever. We are going to be in the market for a pantry door soon and will be back. Super helpful and friendly staff!</review>< Date>

When I moved across the country, the lamp my grandfather gave me broke and Olde Good Things was able to fix it and bring it back to life. He was extremely gentle with it and had it done on the same day. Excellent service! I highly recommend going to him.</Review>

Olde Good Things was able to change the plug out on the spot, saving me a lot of money, and he had the special size lightbulbs I needed, all for a VERY reasonable price and done within ten minutes.

<Text>Think of it as an expensive flea market. It's eclectic. First off, there's $3 admission fee. There's an entrance on Melrose and another one on Fairfax. Get there early to find (free) parking. We got there around 10 and they were still filling up the parking at the high school but when we left around 2 there was a line of cars waiting for spaces in the parking lot.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1595093172629, 'text': 'WRONG PLACE!!

Really lovely antique shop with a really, really wide selection of furniture. All kinds really. Beautiful tables, unique wall art, really expansive set of chandeliers and other light fixtures, bathroom fixtures, doors, and even fireplace mantles. They also have an extensive set of items from the Waldorf Astoria. You could just about any unique piece of decoration here, though this is reflected in the prices of some of the items.</text>

<review>I had a great time here! Lots of cool wares and yummy food! There's valet parking where they work off of tips but i didnt realize that it was valet until i pulled in and was imediatley asked to get out of the car, this was unexpected so i needed a few seconds to grab my purse etc out of the car. I explained to the man that i needed a second and didnt realize it was valet and he mumbled "cabrona" under his breath.. needless to say i didnt tip him... i dont understand why he insulted me after a misunderstanding where i was clearly apologetic and rushing out of the car, it definitely wasnt necessary..<//review>< pictures>

<review>I went into this place after driving by for almost a year and being intrigued. I'm specifically looking for a chandelier and there are literally hundreds of used chandeliers in a multitude of styles. Even better, is the fact that many of them are wired so you can see how they look lit. The owners were amazingly helpful and gave me excellent customer service.<//review>< pictures>

Extraordinary place and a great deal of collectibles at Olde Good Things!

Visited this store out of curiousity and was not frustrated. Great store and incredible items.

They parcels to browse and have great arrangements. Heaps of collectibles at reasonable costs. The assistant was even kind and pleasing. I truly welcome that.

Olde Good Things is an incredible place I will say it once more, 5 stars for the items and the staffs. Praise!< /Text>

<Review>I must’ve driven past this place a thousand times and never even realized it was here. So glad I got off the freeway are ran into this place. All of the guys who work here are super knowledgeable and eager to help you find whatever you’re looking for. They have such a wide range of inventory, it’s easy to get caught up in one area and miss an entire section of this huge warehouse. And, it’s actually two shops next door to each other. The larger of the two houses mostly large furniture, decor and hardware items. All of it is super well made. Just looking at each piece, you can see the history and the stories it tells.

Next door is a bit smaller and, although there are furniture items, there are also smaller decor and houseware items as well as some totally random, antique everything items too. I bought an iron monkey and several vintage Olympic pins and a few small jewelry items. Bob, who works the smaller shop, is very nice and helpful. He gave me a good deal on the bundle purchase and took the time to show me a few pieces he hadn’t put out yet.

It’s obvious these guys are passionate about what they do. If you’re looking to decorate or remodel or even just want to look at some really cool stuff, this place will not disappoint.<//Review>< pics>

Lots of amazing things, but be ready to pay.  Im not saying that their prices are too exorbitant, just saying that they can charge what they want because you won't find anything like what they have.  Super helpful staff, very welcoming.</Text>

Excellent spot with everything antique from old NYC and Los Angeles architectures interior and exterior. From door handles to pool lights, to old sketch desks and chandeliers, drawers, doors, tin ceiling tiles,  old bulbs, posters, art. Litterally two warehouses worth of amazing.  Prices are steep, but their product is excellent and cared for.</Text>

Great place to visit and get inspired, but if you earn less than $150k a year you can't afford anything in this store. Prices on salvaged lighting fixtures, doors, windows and hardware are obscenely overinflated. Prices on everything are overinflated. This store is for designers shopping for their wealthy clients.<//text>

I asked my husband why he was going to R&S for a tune up instead of  Jiffy Lube.  "They do an excellent job on my corvette...they're worth it."  [Clyde has been taking his 2014 Vet ever since he bought the car.  He trust their service, respect their integrity and  they care as if its their own car.]< /review>

<Review>My 2012 Chevy Camaro has needed a few repairs and R&S is certainly trust worthy. They specialize in performance cars (although I'm sure they can handle anything). Their prices on performance cars are competitive to the rest of the industry (they aren't a discount automotive shop). However from what I've learned, that when it comes to a performance car, you get what you pay for. And these guys are straight shooters in respect to price and needed work. They won't try to upsell or oversell you something you don't need. They are also very quick and stand behind all the work they've done for me over the years.</Review><resp>None<//resp><rate>5<//rate>< Date>

<time>1612464545137<//time><Text>I have been going to R&S ever since I was able to drive. My family has been using them for years. When I moved out of the area for 8 years I needed to find a new auto shop to get my car serviced and for any of my needs. I was greatly disappointed at the lack of integrity that other shops had. I was shocked because I hadn't known any different having only used R&S for the majority of my life. This led me to drive back to the valley just to have my car serviced anytime something came up. I knew I could trust them to be truthful with me and only recommend the work that actually needed to be done and do so at a fair price. I would recommend them to anyone.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><gmap_id>0x80c2868c59a43c97:0x88d597770e6ddd15</gmap_id><Name>Tony Ker< /Name>< user_id>

Super friendly, super fast, and super trustworthy. Kevin at the front counter is THE MAN! Talk about above and beyond, this gentleman established a new relationship with my fleet company in front of me, allowing them to service my company truck instead of relying on the poor service of other local chain shops. All of my vehicles are now serviced by the amazing team at R&S!</review>

<Review>FIVE stars in my opinion for over eleven years now. Eddie and his crews do an excellent job of diagnosing, repairing and maintaining my vehicles and take great care of me as their customer. Prices are always fair and the parts and work always good. LOWEST priced shop? Maybe not. However, it's easily the best VALUE, hands down. Far superior to any dealer-garage experience I've ever had in the SCV.
Highly recommended</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80c2868c59a43c97:0x88d597770e6ddd15</gmapID></record>

Our daughter goes to school nearby and her car is old and needed to be looked over from top to bottom to ensure safety and that everything was working fine.  Eddie worked with us and made sure we got everything done that was needed and pointed out what can be deferred for another time.  Friendly and efficient service.</review>

Miracle workers!  I've been coming here for years; the fact that I have two older vehicles, one high mileage, makes no difference--the vehicles are always kept at factory standards!  Recently we collaborated on an upgrade project for the 2000 6.5 diesel that required exquisite attention to detail--the shop went way above & beyond that resulted in an excellent outcome--I feel confident in driving anywhere, & the first trip up the 395 at 8000 feet confirmed that--she roared over the summit effortlessly!  6.5's are notorious for being unreliable, finicky, and in general very difficult to maintain & operate--not this one!  We may be moving back east & I feel confident that we'll pass state inspection  (been there, done that--Maryland basically tears the car down as an example)  with no drama.  Great shop, great rates, great service.  Thanks R & S!< /text>

This mechanic is overpriced. They promised to get work done in one day but at the last minute delayed the pick up until the next day. They didn't want to take responsibility for their technician crew up. Their customer service is disappointing.</text>

<text>Price was average for regular maintenance but way higher to replace my tie rod ends and to get realigned, always get more than one quote. Satisfied with service and seem to be very knowledgeable. They also got me in and out a lot quicker than expected. Steve took time out of a busy schedule to go on a test drive with me and Jerry was a pleasure to deal with. I’ve only been there once but will be going there again. Steve also gave me a great tip to get better mpg with my diesel.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

Mario, Dylan and the rest of the group are always polite and courteous.  They give great service.  I have never had any problems with their mechanics.  I especially enjoy the shuttle service when anything major needs to be done.  I was referred to them by a very reliable source; so I knew even before I started using them.<//text>

<review>R&S Automotive have been our mechanics for the last few years. We find them professional and attentive and quite reasonably priced. They never push us to carry out any unnecessary repairs and always provide a fairly accurate estimate of costs before making the repairs. The staff is very professional and polite. They used to be open on Saturdays occasionally, which was very convenient for our family, since we have small children. Hopefully they'll decide to open on Saturdays again soon!<//review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

< review>
R&S was recommended to me 4 years ago by a trusted friend.  As a widow who knows nothing about the workings of an automobile and doesn't care to learn, I took my friend's advice.  So glad I did.  Mario and the guys have taken excellent care of my car and motorhome.  I had a problem with a tire once and they advised me to go to a tire store.  I did and the tire store not only fixed the tire (free) they told me I needed an $800 brake job,(not so free) which they would be happy to do right then and there.  I took my car back to R&S and asked them to check the brakes.  They found nothing wrong with them and did not charge me. That was two years ago.  The brakes are still fine.   I'm a regular customer who knows R&S to be honest, professional, trustworthy and excellent at their job. I highly recommend them.<//review>

<Time>1548893432851< /Time><text>Well, I have been taking my vehicles to R&S for a long time.  You don't go here to save money but due to the fact this a family business I believed in the quality of work they should do.  It always seemed that every time I took a car here there was always another problem with the car within a few days.  I always chalked it up to the fact the car was getting older.  This particular incident is different.  My wife called ahead to ask for the wait time if she came in for an oil change and tire rotation.  They told her she would be out in under 45 minutes.  My poor wife waited over two hours and 45 minutes before the car was ready.  They also told her there was a nail in the tire that was in the sidewall, meaning we needed a new tire.  They ordered the tire and had her come back then next day.  Once she left they charged her $236 for one tire, which took them over an hour to put on.  The problem is that when she got home the nail was still in the tire.  She called R&S who stated she must have picked up another nail (in the same place as the last nail).  I drove down to R&S where they showed me a hole, not a nail, that was not in the side of the tire.  They told me my wife was lying about the time she waited for the oil change and told me there was nothing they would do for me.  I had to go to a different tire store who patched the tire for free.  I truly believe they took advantage of my wife due to her being a woman and overcharged us for the tire, had her wait an unacceptable time for the oil change and would not accept the fact they changed the wrong tire in the first place (even though it should have just been patched).  I will never return to R&S for any type of service.< /text><user_name>Mark Man</user_name><Response>{'time': 1549302030421, 'text': 'We apologize that your recent visit did not meet your standards. The oil change service would have taken the estimated time of 45 minutes, but the customer showed about an hour after calling in. The total time of service was 2 hours (reviewed on the security cameras), which included additional services aside from the oil change. The tire had a nail puncture outside of the legal repair zone, and was very close to the sidewall; we are looking out for your safety, and would not want to be held liable if the patch failed. The tire that was replaced, was also rotated to the front (being a FWD vehicle) which explains the misunderstanding of us "replacing the wrong tire". We have called both of the customers to further discuss, but were told we "have the wrong number" by the recipient, and disconnected shortly after.'}<//Response>< rating>

I've been going to R&S for nearly 25 years and you can always count on them to be honest about what your car needs done and then fixing whatever the problem is correctly the first time. I've never had to bring a car back because they didn't do the job right the first time. They do great work and are completely reliable.</Text>

Nice people, clean comfortable waiting area. Honest techs. I have been going there for years, mainly for smog certs, but I trust them totally. They helped me diagnose an RV battery issue 2 years ago. No charge.< /text>

R&S has been my go to shop since I owned a car.  They are very knowledgeable and only give recommendations for stuff that actually needs to be done.  They won't try to tack on a bunch of unnecessary repairs.  They are honest and trustworthy.  I'm pretty mechanically inclined but anything that I can't (or don't want to) take care of myself, I take to them and they get it done fast and at a great price!

I would recommend them to anyone!</text>

R&S Automotive did everything that they said they would in the time that they said they would and even took care of a problem that another repair shop had tried and failed at twice. And all at a very reasonable price. By far the most professional and respectable repair shop that I have ever dealt with.</Text>

<text>I've been going to R&S for over 20 years. R&S is reliable. Quality work they stand behind. If they say your car will be ready - it will be ready. Usually in and out in a day. There are less expensive auto shops but the price is worth the quality work and reliability.
Mario is awesome! Eddie is always open to hear about our experience good or bad. Rarely is there ever a bad experience.
Best place in SCV to have work done. My whole family takes their vehicles to R&S!</text>< Pics>

Don't go here if you expect to save money compared to a dealer.  These guys were 25% higher on a repair than what the dealer wanted to charge. Outrageous. I asked if they wanted to take another look at their price but they stayed firm.  I guess 7 years worth of service, repairs and patronage doesn't account for much to them.  Or maybe I just dealt with the wrong guy.  Oh well R&S just lost a long time customer.<//review>

This established group, is just that, Established, An honest group,they come with an array of vehicle experience, Quality Customer Service, and well thought out estimates, that can be within your budget.

Personally, I've brought to them my 2008 FORD F-150, 2008 LEXUS RX300, 2012 TOYOTA PRIUS 4, 2004 AND 2012 FOR EXPEDITION'S.

Give these guys a try, ask for Mario!</review>

<text>R&S Automotive is everything a repair shop should be. The shop is very clean as are the technicians, no grease monkeys here. The staff is knowledgeable and provides easy to understand explanations of the work needing to be done. I found the cost of service and repairs to be very reasonable. You can be confident that you will not be ripped-off at R&S Automotive. R&S Automotive also has a great waiting room with free coffee and Wi-Fi plus a wide variety of magazines to help pass the time. If you cannot wait for your vehicle to be serviced R&S Automotive also has a courtesy van to take you to your home or office and they will pick you up when your vehicle is finished; and Gene, the van's driver, will entertain you with witty conversation.<//text>< Pictures>

This place is terrible. I'm a journeyman lineman and if I know anything it's that you have to be good at your job to get a good reputation and make money. That's not the case here. I took my truck in to have a valve cover replaced and both inner tie rods changed. I get the truck back and the dash is lit up like a Christmas tree and the oil pressure gauge doesn't work. And the alignment is all loose after a day of driving on the interstate.<//Review>

You failed to mention that we took care of your oil pressure gauge situation, as it was only a loose connection - but we do apologize, again. Also, your vehicle is highly modified with a lift, bigger tires, and multiple electronics; we doubt your truck ever rode 'tight' on the interstate. We hope you find another automotive repair shop that can meet your needs."}< /response></record>

My experience over the years with mechanics has often been disappointing. Often what I am told by the service writer does not quite make sense. I guess you could say that I have become hard to please.
This was my first visit to R&S. When I initially described the problem with the vehicle, Mario, the service writer, understood what I was saying. During the repairs, Mario kept me informed about the repair process. You could tell that he had first hand knowledge of the work being performed. The problem was correctly diagnosed. Unnecessary repairs were avoided. Price was fair. R&S has a new satisfied customer!</Text>

This is my 3rd or 4th time taking our 2010 Nissan Altima to R&S, and like each time before, the experience was great. I had a smog check, oil change, and rear brake pads and rotors changed. I like that they provide you with an itemized estimate of the charges prior to your servicing, and then call you with updates or changes. My whole family goes to R&S and I would definitely recommend them to a friend.</text>

Honest, professional and thorough.     R&S has been our go to mechanic for over 10 years. And I have no reason to change.

Their quality is top notch  and they standyby their work.      But the most impressive part is their integrity.

Two examples:    I had some work done to my van.   It was rather extensive and the price tag reflected it.    The following day, I get a call from Eddie, the owner.   He said that he reviewed the bill and found that some of the work was covered by their warranty   "Where would you like the refined chris eck mailed for the $500".

Second example happend just last week.   My Sedans power steering went out.     I have them check and it needs a new pump.    But instead of the $300 charge to replace it, Mario, their awesome service advisor, tells me that Chevy has a service advisory on it, and if i take it to them, they will replace it free.    Who does that?!!    They could have made $300 and I would have been none the wiser.

That's why I take all my cars and highly recommend R&S Automotive.< /Review>

I switched to R&S on an enthusiastic recommendation from a family friend. I became suspicious of my old mechanic when he slapped me with over $700 in maintenance and repairs on a drastically over-priced used car he'd sold me. Up to that point I'd only racked up 2100 miles on it. When I brought it to R&S to fix a coolant leak, they identified the problem as a leaky hose and stuck thermostat, and didn't try to add on any suspicious or arbitrary services. They charged me $75 less than their original estimate.

They also carted me back and forth twice between Newhall and Canyon Country at no extra cost. Everyone I met was friendly and approachable and patient with my questions. As far as I am able to judge, R&S is a fair, honest, and efficient mechanic, and for me, that is everything.< /review>

Bought our first Subaru here; visited a few Subaru dealerships and this one was by far the best! Harley took care of us (and be sure to ask for Don in financing); everything was super easy and, most importantly, fast! Best experience I ever had buying a car. I’ll be coming here for our next car, for sure.<//Text>

This is our go-to Subaru repair shop for the last 5+ years. The last two times I was in I was helped by a gentleman named Don Doyle. He was very friendly and conscious of my time. He really listened to my concerns and made sure to review the warranty coverage I had purchased. Both
times I was in and out quickly and all of my car issues were addressed. Thanks Don & team!</Text>

Bought my first car here, no problem. The issue was as soon as I took advantage of getting my car serviced here. First time my brakes started making a screeching noise when I would stop at lights and signs, never had that issue before I had my car serviced and it was never resolved. Second issue was when I used the last free service on my car and my car would shake aggressively simultaneously passing a burning rubber smell through my AC. Not one to make bad reviews, but I’ve had the car for 3 years now and they never fixed any issue with my car.<//review>

I just bought my 2nd Subaru from this dealer in February of this year and Dan Gressman made the whole process very easy in a year of chaos. They didn't have the car I wanted on the lot but Dan went and found the exact model and I was extremely pleased with my purchase.<//Review>

I bought Subaru Ascent last January and we only used it recently with 300 miles on it, unfortunately  the rear tire got punctured. We have upcoming trip to Utah the following day. I seeked Subaru of Ontario for help and so thankful for Mr Carlos the service manager, he helped me immediately and goes above and beyond to help me rectify the problem. He helped me out of goodwill and I couldn't be more thankful and happy. If I could give 10 stars 🌟 I will give it with all my heart, they deserve it.</text>

Edited to add Service Manager Carlos called me to apologize for the poor customer service that I received. Once upset I am not a very nice person. Carlos did an excellent job handling my issues. Thank you Carlos!
Scheduled an appointment for an airbag recall and was advised to check in early. I did get there early only to be ignored. Promised a loaner vehicle and didn’t get one. Was promised a pick up from Enterprise and didn’t get that either. Finally a service porter drove me to Enterprise only to be offered a tiny Versa. Thank you Subaru of Ontario for your less than subpar customer service and thank you for ruining my daughter’s 8 th grade graduation day!< /Review>

Drove here from Victorville to pick up a part and they closed parts counter 30 minutes before they said they were gonna close and then said they couldn't help me. When I came to buy my car I wanted to buy here and they didn't even want to show me the cars because they thought I was just a kid looking ended up buying at another subaru dealer. Should have remembered that and not come back.<//review>

<Review>Was given the run around all day after giving my information over phone to purchase a vehicle since I live out of state. Was told twice that my salesman was with a customer (me thinking “ok well I’m a purchasing customer too”) I kindly asked for someone else to help me which I was abrasively told I’d have to wait for the salesman I started with (me now thinking, “he’s done nothing with my information, and I want to purchase”) Salesman rocky gave minimal time and follow up until later that evening. Come to find out another salesman sold the car that I was trying to purchase all day long. Never again.</Review>< pictures>

The best experience I’ve ever had purchasing a car. Just for reference let me tell you I am a young single woman so going into a dealership by myself was intimidating. Everybody has heard the horror stories I’m sure… But when I came to Subaru it was the most pleasant experience I’ve had thus far buying a new car. The salesman listened to everything I wanted in the car and matched me up perfectly while staying within my budget. The paperwork went really smoothly and quickly surprisingly. It was also understandable and they made sure I knew exactly what I was signing up for and that I was OK with everything. All in all I felt really comfortable purchasing a car here and I highly recommend this dealership. If you’re looking for honest people and a straightforward experience definitely come here!< /Review>

I had a wonderful experience with this dealership! They are really friendly and straight to the point. I even called back 2 weeks after in regards to a document that i needed help with. Iman was very helpful and explained everything to me. Shoutout to Iman of the financing department, she is really sweet and will help you out. I recommend you go to this dealership instead of shopping somewhere else as they have great customer service!</review>

On October 10th I brought my 2014 Outback in to evaluate a violent shaking in the front end. Wheels had been balanced & rotated the day prior. Service tech stated it was due to the tires that are not factory size. Problem is I have run the same tires for over 3 years with no issues. They also stated they could not replicate the issue. They recommended a wheel alignment, which I agreed to. As soon as I left the service department, I was able to replicate the issue, without a problem. Unsatisfied, I took my car to a local repair shop. Within an hour, the shop had diagnosed the problem as a faulty control arm and bearing. They were able to test drive the vehicle, replicate the problem, and then put it on the rack to check the components. What this tells me is the service personnel who handled my vehicle are either lazy or incompetent. Very sad because I purchased my vehicle from Ontario Subaru in March 2014 and it was one of the best car buying experiences I've ever had.< /Text>

I will Highly recommend working with the great people at this location. Debbie, Carlos and Vanessa Felix are such a cool team to work with. I recently had to replace my windshield and Carlos help me through every step of it. While Vanessa kept me updated with the process of my windshield order and installation. Debbie when as far as giving my wife the option to use a rental for the few hours while my car was getting fix. thankfully she didn't have to, Due to how fast the installation team and calibration guys worked. Thank you everyone at Subaru of Ontario!! Cheers.< /review>

But its definitely one I'm going to now everytime I need service just because of Mr Clay. He was the biggest help and really took care of me with the upmost respectable customer service. So if you guys need absolutly anything to be done to your Subaru. I highly reccomend coming to this dealership and if possible. Ask for Mr. Clay Sensi personally he will take care of you!< /Text>< GmapID>

< review>
My wife and I found this vehicle for sale through the Schools First FCU TrueCar app as a certified pre-owned vehicle on Feb 24, 2021. When we went to view the vehicle three days later on the weekend with a scheduled appointment the vehicle was not washed vacuumed or certified for sale. Subaru of Ontario still proceeded with the sale of the vehicle to my wife and I. During the certification inspection they found damage to the vehicle that they wanted us to help pay for after the deal was finalized. My wife and I ended up driving back to the dealership to cancel the purchase of the vehicle because three days later the vehicle was still not ready for delivery and no one at the dealership ever gave us an honest answer on the vehicle. Now March 11th 2021 I just received a bill from Subaru finance for a vehicle I never received because Subaru of Ontario still has not filed the paperwork. I cannot say this is how all car sales are dealt with at this dealership but this was my buying experience at this dealership. This vehicle is still on their website for sale today.</review>

Subaru of Ontario handed me the best car buying experience of my adult life. I did most of the financing online, so when I came into the dealership the process was quick and painless. I waited longer for the car to be washed than I did for financing, etc. I was helped by Aaron while doing online financing and then assisted by Adrian in finalizing the details. Both salesman were helpful, respectful, friendly and informative. I highly recommend this dealership if you’re in the market for a Subaru.< /review>

I had been in the market for a WRX for a few months. Talking to 3 or 4 dealerships. Luisa was honest and easy to work with. This is my first Subaru purchase but I don’t think it’ll be my last. The honesty was a huge reason I went with Luisa at Ontario Subaru. Thank you!</text>

<name>Jenifer Gerrick</name><Review>We purchased a 2020 Impreza tonight and the transaction was easy and both employees we worked with were fantastic. Our salesman, Harley Hays was professional, personable and not a typical car salesman. He identified our wants and needs and found the perfect vehicle and options for my daughter without pushing us into something more. I opted to apply for financing online in order to pre-qualify and get the process started. The finance person Don Horrigan wrote up our paperwork and had us in and out after offering a few more options. Overall I’m very pleased with the purchase and my daughter is beyond excited for her brand new car. Thank you again Harley and Don!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><GmapID>0x80c34aa17f442b8f:0x4a0508565192b8a9</GmapID><Date>1611204832234</Date>< Rating>

<Text>Was in the market for an STI with different dealerships. Subaru of Ontario won my business over with there customer service and we're fast at getting back at me with any questions I had. If you get the chance ask for Aaron Brown or Amber Arias they were straight up and honest from the start. Any offer other dealers made Subaru of Ontario were able to match it and do better. I'd suggest to give them a chance to earn your business. You won't be disappointed.<//Text><resp>None< /resp><Rating>5< /Rating><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOYQhucF2cVVEq7Fu3r4QtvL1a9-ZR7MuKsluZX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVqKMjo0AoRAci4ala0Nv_-kkBvzW6-XI7wb7X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><userid>109505233184882487385< /userid>< date>

<text>I always wanted a Subaru ever since I was in high school. They're amazing and reliable cars to own. I eventually graduated college and decided to own a Subaru. So I went here at Subaru of Ontario to find out more and I can safely safe. The staff working here is amazing. From the mechanics, to the parts department and the sales team. I had a great experience overall when picking my new Subaru :)<//text>< Pics>

<Rating>3</Rating><review>To begin, my salesman Marc Contreras was amazing. There was no haggling, he listened to what I wanted and didn't push me for more features that I didn't need. If I was just reviewing him, I would give him a 5 star review. I was very happy regarding that part of my experience. When it came to the finance department (particularly in regard to Lisa Clark), I was less than happy. I left after signing the paperwork, but about a week later was contacted by email saying that she forgot to get me to sign something for my car loan. I tried calling her 6 times over the next week, including leaving messages, to try to get in contact with her. I also emailed her back. Finally, she got back to me, and we finally agreed to sign the paperwork via email as I live over 2 hours away from the dealership. Following this, I got another letter in the mail about this missing signature, dated after I had gotten the signature back to her. I felt very attacked, making it feel as though it was my fault that I had missed the signature in the first place, when I was never offered this paperwork when I was signing paperwork. I was also frustrated over how difficult it was to get back in contact with her. This is why my review is 3 stars.< /review>< pictures>

I just brought in a WRX MY13 for a Pre-Purchase Inspection. They were very busy as were the surrounding Subaru Dealers. But the Service writer got one of his guys on it almost straight away. They did a decent job of checking out the cars overall condition. I purchased the oil and they did an oil change pulling a sample of oil in a white cup, so I could see if there was any visible metal. (another long story). All was good, and the car proved to be in great condition for a 7 year old vehicle with 124K miles.
Not the most cutting edge dealership, probably fairly old. But they get things done and are professional. For my limited exposure, I had a 5 star service.
Thanks Guys.</text>

Highly recommend asking for Aaron Brown! So personable, almost makes you feel like family. Also got me an amazing deal on my Crosstrek, as we needed a bigger car that fit our son and fur children.  Will forever come back and ask for Aaron once my husband decides what he wants or I end up picking for him.<//text>

Subaru of Ontario was one of the dealerships i contacted and they were very helpful and informative with their vehicle availability and finace options. One of the cars i was interested in was in transit and they kept me up to date on when it would arrive. Once it arrived, we schedule an appointment so i can test drive a few of the cars I was interested in.  Dan Gressman was the salesman that took care of me. He was an awesome salesman and very informative on the cars. On top of that, he prepared all the necessary paperwork and was out of the office in my new car in less then a few hours. He broke down the options and took his time explaining what each option meant. Overall i had an amazing experience that Subaru of Ontario and everyone there was awesome. If you happen to be in the market for a new car, ask for Mr. Gressman, awesome salesman.</text>

<text>This is my second Subaru that I purchased at Ontario Subaru from Aaron Brown.  I just bought a Subaru Forester Sport in a dark blue.  It looks black at night and shiny blue during the day. Aaron Brown made it easy and all of my paperwork was there when I got there after negotiating on the phone. He made sure the car was clean and ready to go. His customer service skills are wonderful and I will definitely buy my next Subaru through him. Subarus are the best cars and Aaron Brown is the most helpful salesman.<//text>< pictures>

My partner and I came to this location to buy a new Crosstrek and our experience was WONDERFUL. Amber was amazing and she took such great care of us and walked us through all the steps and all the features of our new car. She was so friendly and welcoming. Michael also helped close our deal and he was extremely pleasant to work with as well. He explained everything to us clearly and worked with our needs and questions very patiently. Both of these workers were great, despite the circumstances of this pandemic and being understaffed and over-worked. They are awesome, give them a raise Subaru!<//Review>

<review>We just bought a 2020 Outback limited and it was a happy time and a sad time. Happy as we bought a new Subaru from great people and sad because of the times. They had to lay-off half or more of the dealer staff. Can only see cars by appointment only. We hope all businesses will weather this economic category 3 hurricane. Many thanks for a very good and smooth sale.<//review>< pics>

Not what I expected. They need a better communication system. Waiting 4 hours for an oil change because no text or call was made, seems unreasonable.  Saw an email when I got home that car was ready two hours into waiting (glad I had appointment 😔,,). I was given a number to text, no answer. I do appreciate the cleanliness of my car and labor .</review>

<Review>I recently purchased my 2020 Subaru Outback in February. I began speaking with Dan Gressman at the end of last year, which I was immediately surprised he did not push the sale on me then when I was just starting my car search, he gave me time and space. I reached back out to him after doing some research of what I wanted, and how much I would like to pay, and again definitely happy with Dan's overall communication and openness. My immediate family is a Toyota family, it's what we are familiar with. After my conversations with my extended family and friends who are Subaru owners, and talking with Dan, I was much more comfortable with my choice. My choice with purchasing from Subaru of Ontario overall came down to location, and my overall experience with Dan.

I am loving my Outback! Thanks Dan for your patience and input of knowledge throughout the purchase.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Adrian Diaz was absolutely amazing. I’ve never owned a Subaru before and was very hesitant at first. He was very informative, to the point, and no BS. I really got a good deal on my new Subaru. He goes above and beyond in all aspects. Highly recommend going to him when considering becoming or continuing as a Subaru owner.<//Text>

<text>Ask for Cheryl Sauer. She helped our family with two car purchases over 4 years. We were out of state and she made it all so simple with exceptional service and follow up to close all loose ends.  Always available for questions and support like a trusted friend.  Reliable and trustworthy dealership.</text>< pics>

<review>I called them up to return the leased car as directed by Subaru Finance team, the associate David outright told that they are not accepting lease end vehicles now... WTH! My idea was to talk about buying a new and a leased car from them once I finish discussing about the lease end. You lost the opportunity SubaruOfOntario, not one but two vehicles because of employees like David.
Dealers should be more careful on how they deal with customers specially during these testing times<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>I’ve been in the market for almost a year now. And as a customer I’ve been scared to go in and talk to sales just because of experiences I’ve had in the past. So recently I’ve been pushing hard to get a new car and put in an inquiry for about 5 local dealers. One called me and I asked about pricing. That dealer said “we can’t give pricing over the phone cause we can lose a sale over a few bucks” hung up on him cause I knew that dealer was no good. Next dealer said they couldn’t get me to a price I wanted. Cool. 3rd dealer gave me a crazy low price but it wasn’t the model I wanted.  I know it wasn’t cause the Msrp didn’t match up. I kept asking if it was the limited model and he wouldn’t give me an answer. Literally kept copying and pasting a link when I asked him a question about the car and would say stuff like “like I said check the link” I told that guy what I wanted and what color. And he literally wanted me to go above and beyond to get him an exact stock number when he could’ve done his job and did it for me. So I passed on that dealer. Other dealers didn’t respond to me and took me as a joke so I found the closest dealer to me which was Subaru of Ontario. Went in and got help from the salesman David You.

This was the best car sales experience I have ever had in all my years of buying cars. I’ve probably went through 15 cars so far. And this was the best. David You helped me get the car I wanted. He had no issue running in and out of the dealership to grab keys to see another car. He was happy to help. And that experience tells you a lot about David and the dealership. Whole deal and process went smooth, and David answered all my questions. Even if I forgot to ask him a question before he ran to his manager. I felt bad for making him run back and forth but David did it with no problems. After agreeing on a deal he brought us into finance and Lisa in finance helped us with everything including a service contract/warranty. Whole process in finance went quick and smooth as well and we were out.

After finance David showed us the car and everything about the car. He was very informative and it felt like we were in and out.

Love the car and will be a lifetime customer from now on. If you are looking for a new car ask for David You. Yes “You” is his last name. He will help you out.<//Review><time>1591921531186< /time>< pictures>

This review and stars are for Austin Day.  Austin is incredibly knowledgeable about all of the safety, convenience, organizational and entertainment features of Subaru automobiles.  He came to our home, answered all of our questions and shared any information he thought would help us.  He made sure that we had all of the special programming that makes Subaru unique.  A polite and enthusiastic young man, Austin goes above and beyond the call of duty.  Thank you.< /text>

<Text>I rarely ever write reviews but I feel like this dealership definitely deserves this review.
First of all, we literally left with the best car (2020 Subaru WRX STI Series White) from Subaru of Ontario. We had such a phenomenal purchasing experience from David You. Not only was he knowledgeable on the cars that we were interested in, he was very patience and honest. He wasn’t pushy and definitely didn’t pressured us into buying a car. He thoroughly answered many of our questions and concerns. Most importantly, he was willing to work with us even if that involves him running back and forth many times. Once we came to an agreeable term, we met with the Finance Manager, Lisa to finalize and to sign the contracts. Lisa thoroughly went through the contract with us and kindly answered every financial questions that we had. It was a breeze.
After finalizing and signing the contract with Lisa, David took his time showing us all the features that our new car has to offers even down to syncing our garage remote to SafeLink in our car. We are not first time car buyers but it’s obvious that he went above and beyond to show us our new car’s full potential.
Coming from someone who worked in customer service for 12 years, I truly appreciate the time, efforts and positive attitudes that David and Lisa has shown us. We are so pleased with such pleasant and relaxed experience at Subaru of Ontario. We are over the moon with our new car. If you’re in the market for a Subaru, do yourself a huge favor and just go ask for David You. You won’t be disappointed.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Highly recommend this dealership!  The purchasing process was the most pleasant I've every experienced.  No high-pressure sales, which was SO refreshing.  The employees were helpful, knowledgeable, kind, and efficient.  Vince (sales), Michael (finance), Rocky (test drive), and Josh (technology) were all AMAZING!  This is my 1st Subaru purchase, but I expect to love it and return next time I need a car.  I will definitely recommend this dealership to my friends and family!< /Text>

<review>I'm so sorry to have had a bad experience here. My wife took in her car for its regular maintenance and they told her she had a nail in her tire and they were going to fix it no problem. They patched it up and sent her on her way. Great!

After they patched the tire, she got a low tire pressure warning and sure enough, the tire wouldn't hold any air. We figured we would take it back so they could take a look. The manager mentioned to her that it wasn't the patch, there was a pin-hole, showed it to her, and said there wasn't anything they could do. We were a little surprised because the tire was holding air just fine and there were no problems prior to bringing it into the dealership. The service center manager was rude to my wife, to the point where my wife doesn't even want to return because of how she was treated. He claimed there was no way that could have happened there or that his machine caused the hole. Instead of helping out a customer, offering some sort of solution, entertaining the idea that there is a possibility that the issue was caused at his garage, he was rude to my wife. Now, I'm not saying that he give us a free tire, but rather, try to problem solve.

At the end of the day, the tire doesn't matter, it's the treatment of a customer that just needed some help that matters.

Needless to say, we will no longer take our car to be serviced there, look to purchase any cars from there, and do any business with the Subaru of Ontario.</review>< userid>

The service department changed a bunch of settings in our family vehicle. They said our key fob was in the vehicle and it was not. Took close to 20 minutes to get our key fob back. The lady on the phone directory would not even give us a chance to leave a message. Other than that the sales associates were polite.< /review>

Why give me an appointment to take my car in a week from now if you guys can’t keep up with service ? I took the day of from work they wasted my time. I’d avoid this place at any costs no customer service at all. If theirs an issue going on in your business call you’re customers ahead and save them the headache with wasting their time.<//Review>

Made an appointment to have my car serviced and was told it would be about an hour and a half. Come back in an hour and a half and my car is still in line to be serviced tell ing me it will be another hour. So made an appointment to not even be serviced at the time of the appointment. Very unhelpful staff.</Review>

They didn't even clip on the part on top where the side airbag is on passenger side. What is worse they never told me they didn't have the part so the air bag was exposed!! My husband is the one who noticed about 2 weeks after and they had to order the part. Really? Could've done it before. Also they charged me $1,000 to what they thought was the problem in my car and it wasn't! Then they tried to charge me $3,000 more for what might be the problem. I said no give me my car and my car fixed itself. Everytime I came here bad service. Not even a good morning. My kids have more manners then they do.<//Text></record>

<Review>It was the best experience ever. The price we closed online, was the price on the final agreement. Two hours, and I was out with my new Subaru. They tried me like a king. Anthony Gullart was the internet sales professional that was taking care of my deal from the beginning to the end, he never lies to me. Definitely, I will be back to this dealership again!< /Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<Name>Sachin L C<//Name><Review>Limited stock of vehicle I was looking for. They were kind of rushing due to price point.

Had a great experience at Subaru of Ontario! Every Subaru employee I interacted with was nice and professional, especially Amber! She helped me with everything for my new forester and made sure I was within my budget. The whole process of ordering my car and the delivery was so simple and stress free. I would definitely recommend purchasing a car from this dealership! :)</text>

Usually when I walk on to a dealership lot I am greeted by a sales person. Sometimes that can be annoying when you just want to look around. However,  I have sold cars before and I know the protocol. This particular visit did not follow that protocol. I was seriously interested in test driving two cars because my wife and I are in the market for new cars due to our leases ending soon. We are very interested in Subaru vehicles because of their reputation. Unfortunately, we could not get anyone to help us. I did notice that the dealership was busy, possibly because of the red tag sale they were having, however, that's No excuse. I was always taught that no matter how busy you are, you should always acknowledge new clients and make sure they are taken care of. This didn't happen. I even went inside the dealership and ask if we could speak to someone and no one responded. So I will take my business elsewhere. Ontario Subaru, you missed out on the sale of two additional cars because I will never return to your dealership.< /review>

<Text>Just recently purchased a 2019 Subaru Outback from Adrian D. I can honestly say that he took the time to ensure that I was completely satisfied with the vehicle before signing any paperwork. He was very kind and professional the entire time that I spent at the dealership. Before I drove off, my daughter wanted to take a picture of me and my new outback- Adrian made sure the background of the  photo would perfect by moving my new car to a picture perfect location. Thank you again Adrian for all of your help with the purchase of my new car! This is my second time purchasing a vehicle from Adrian. Also, thank you to Mike and Daniel at Subaru of Ontario!</Text></record></dataset><record>
<username>Cathy Goshen< /username><Text>I just recently had service to my Forester again due to my sales agent, Rocky Gutierrez. He has consistently followed up with me with reminders of “service due”. I really appreciate this as with my busy schedule I sometimes forget. He not only did a super job with the purchase, he continues to show accountability with these friendly reminders. Anyone looking for a Subaru look up Rocky at the Ontario facility!  My friend has already bought 2 vehicles from him and the Ontario store.
Thank u Rocky!  See u at the next service call.
The service department is really great too!<//Text>< date>

Poor customer service across the board; Sales and Service is horrific. Parts is the only department I've interacted with that hasn't been a complete debacle (if not for the Parts Department, the rating would be 1 star). Don't waste your time acquiring or servicing a Subaru here. Save yourself the headache and go to Puente Hills, San Bernadino, or Riverside. Sales will play games with you. Service will create issues with your car that did not present themselves before your visit, then blame you and accept zero responsibility. I've dealt with this dealership off and on for the past almost 7 years, and can count on one hand the number of positive experiences I've had. Avoid the tomfoolery; go elsewhere and get the customer service your hard-earned money deserves.</Review>

MY husband and I had the best experience at Subaru of Ontario. We started off emailing with Alexis. We explained what we wanted and she had the perfect car for us! She took the time to find what we were looking for and gave us the best deal possible. Thank you Alexis for your extra efforts to ensure we got exactly what we wanted! When it came down to going in to purchase, we met up with Diana. Diana was the absolute best at helping us buy our family car! She was very knowledgeable and was up front and honest about everything. She made us feel comfortable and at ease. Mike in finance was great! he explained everything in detail for us to understand what we were signing and made it quick and easy. My husband and I are more than happy with our purchase and will recommend all of our friends and family to purchase a car here.</Text>

What a mess! Despite having a bad experience at this dealership when I bought my car, I came here to get my cars first service because of it’s convenient location. What a waste of time. First, when I pulled up the driveway was full of double parked cars ( the fire department needs to come and  shut that down) that people were parking and leaving because no one was coming out to start any check in process. People were randomly walking around waiting to be acknowledged, more and more customers showing up, and nothing. I went to find someone inside to ask what is happening, and a woman at the register window said, yes, that’s just how it is here. I left because there was a good chance my car wouldn’t even get serviced that day. Do yourself a favor and don’t waste your time at this dealership. I will never go back. Why would I trust someone to check my car that can’t even properly process customers in an organized or safe way?</text>

Everyone was extremely helpful  and made the experience easier. Our sales representative Enrique Parra explained all the best options and also took the time to explain all the great features our new Ascent comes with. Michael in finance was also extremely helpful and gave us our best options for leasing our beautiful new vehicle.
Thank you to all who helped.</Review>< Name>

After an unfortunate incident with my previous Outback, I needed a new car and I went to Subaru of Ontario. I spoke with Adrian and he was so helpful and we made arrangements to come and see him the following day. He greeted me at the door and then we found out he had come in on his day off. To me that is above and beyond customer service. He was friendly and  made sure I was happy with my purchase and made the whole car buying experience smooth. I would highly recommend Adrian! Thanks again!<//review>

I traded in my 2016 Forrester for a new 2018. Rocky Gutierrez helped me once again. The entire process took less than 1-1/2 hrs. This agent  exceeded my expectations. He is an exceptional representative, knowledgeable and most important to me, genuine and honest. I am planning on purchasing another Subaru for my daughter in the next few months. Although there are several Subaru dealerships closer to where I live, I would not consider purchasing another vehicle from anywhere other than Subaru of Ontario!!!<//review>

Rocky Gutierrez was amazing.  He listened to all my needs and was calm and patient through out the entire car dealership journey.

If you are interested in getting a Subaru do yourself a favor and ask for Rocky.  The guy has been in the business for 30+ years and it really shows.  He knows how to make you feel welcome and does not overwhelm you like some other sales consultants.

I have already recommended Rocky and Subaru of Ontario to many of my friends and family.  Hell, I even gave Rocky’s card to a random guy at AAA.

Kudos, Subaru of Ontario.</text>

Excellent service from Francisco - I had such an easy car buying experience- courteous, friendly, and quick. Michael in finance also easy to work with - drove all the way from San Diego to purchase my Forester and recommend this dealer for the great customer service!<//review>

<review>I took my Subaru to Ontario Subaru last Saturday and I was very pleased and delighted with the service given.  I arrived and not long after I walked into the service office, I was heading out to the lounge after talking with the manager about the sevice I thought I needed.  We talked together to clarify my car's needs. I then went into the comfortable lobby to wait.  It was not long until I was told my car was finished, I was handed my paperwork, had the car brought to me....It was then I noticed they had washed the car.   Nice folks and great service ---I was very please with my visit!< /review>< Pics>

<review>I loved the low pressure during the sale.  I felt the salesman listened to my needs, and helped me find just the car I wanted.  When I wanted to look at other dealerships, there was no pressure to buy at that moment, instead, he handed me his card and said to call if I needed more information.  After trying a couple of other cars, it was clear that Subaru of Ontario was the place to go.  I continue to get this same friendly service when I bring my car in for routine maintenance.  I highly recommend Subaru of Ontario.

Update:  I brought my car in for service this morning, and it was a great experience from start to finish. Marrissa greeted me as soon as I arrived, and when I said I planned to wait, she suggested I head to the waiting room, and she would bring the paperwork to me.  She said the work shouldn't take more than an hour, and 40 minutes later, she came back to tell me everything was done.  She was pleasant, and very helpful.  Great customer service and I continue to be impressed by this dealership.  It is nice that the friendly experience continues well beyond the purchase of the car.</review><Rating>5<//Rating>< Gmap_id>

<rating>3< /rating><review>BE VERY WARY OF THE FINANCING DEPARTMENT. Dan Gressmann was very nice and helpful (internet salesman for Subaru Ontario), I have nothing but positive things to say about him. The purpose of this review is to warn you about their financing department. The VERY LAST document the finance department forced me to sign was an agreement to a $100 "theft registration" service. The paper stated very clearly that this charge was OPTIONAL and was NOT required to buy the vehicle. I asked more than three times for it to be removed and the finance department wouldn't budge, saying it was "to protect cars from being stolen from the lot". I asked why they were passing this cost off on to me and they had no answer, nor could they explain why I was being charged for it. In the end I caved because I had already signed the long-form sales contract, but I should have walked. Be warned: look for this ridiculous charge as you sign your long-form sales contract and threaten to walk if they refuse to remove it. Learn from my mistakes. It's really a shame because I wanted to give Subaru Ontario 5 stars due to Dan, but their greed for $100 ruined that for them. $100 is a small charge relative to the car but it really affects my otherwise positive perception of this dealership.<//review>< pictures>

<review>I've had my car serviced here since I bought it in October of 2010.  I found myself in a jam recently when my radiator went out.  I had the car towed here and was helped by Marvin Clay.  It was late and approaching closing time so I was thankful I could leave it here for Marvin to handle.  My car was repaired 2 days later when parts became available by his team while I could focus on my work.  It was a reassuring feeling to see a familiar face and be treated with respect and professionalism.   It sometimes takes finding oneself stranded and realizing how important our cars are to appreciate the team that gets us back on the road.  Thank you Marvin.</review><Rating>5< /Rating>< Time>

I just purchased a Forester and it was the easiest car purchase I have ever made.  I never felt pressured and Amber made the experience so pleasant.  Amber helped me get a monthly payment that will fit into my budget without having to haggle and barter over a trade in price and interest rate.  All the people I came into contact with at Subaru were nice and did not try to hard sell you.  The car is awesome with everything I could possibly want on it and it drives like a dream. I would recommend Subaru of Ontario to anyone.</text>

This dealership service is hands down the best I ever had. I had appointment at 8:20 and I told them I would wait for the vehicle. Estimated a 2 hours wait for my 30k service. Not bad I think, but I was out on the road in 1.5 hours. Can’t say how much I appreciate the quick service.<//Review>

<review>Bought two cars. It was a great experience and we got a good deal. Previously, I've bought from Ford, BMW, Mini, Toyota, Jeep, Hyundai, and Carmax. The Subaru of Ontario experience is right at the top of my list of 5-star dealerships. I'm a logical buyer, so this dealership was perfect for me because they knew I wanted finance numbers and specs, that's what they gave me. Great team, very organized, top dealership.< /review><name>Benjamin Theisen< /name><Rating>5</Rating><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

If you deal with Cheryl Sauer, you will get the best car shopping experience here at Subaru.  We were able to work out the finances through e-mails and then when it was time to come into the dealership, I was in and out in under an hour.  Even after buying the car, she's still responsive to texts and e-mails when we need her.  This has been my best car shopping experience !< /text>

<Review>Excellent customer service. The guys from Subaru Ontario are professionals, courteous and very detailed oriented.

I recently went in to trade my lease and was able to get a much better deal, Rocky was very personable. A true gentleman who put my needs first.< /Review><userid>106269261862668394973< /userid>< time>

<Review>Awesome experience from start to finish. Our salesman, Brian Johnson, was helpful without us feeling pressured. We got a great deal on 2  2018 Imprezas. Ontario had by far the best selection. We live in the San Fernando Valley , but the trip was worth it. I would definitely recommend this dealer to anyone looking for a Subaru.<//Review>< pictures>

Had the 1st service (6,000 mile) performed last week and have nothing but good to report. The service writer was friendly, as was the cashier and other employees I had contact with. The facility was accommodating for my 1-hour stay, providing my much needed morning coffee. Service was completed in a reasonable amount of time. Thank you Subaru of Ontario, and see you in 6,000 miles.</review>

<Text>This is one of the smaller subaru dealerships and the worst customer service I've dealt with in the many times I've been here (check yelp). The service advisor is rude (and not just to me), but I've been told she's seeking employment elsewhere. I also brought friends to the lot and was not helped for 30 minutes so we ended up leaving. Overall, love the brand but not this dealership.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Wait time for a scheduled appointment is on par with doctors' visits. Had a 1000 appointment. Arrived at 0950, there was a line out to the street for service department. Around 1000, cars were finally being tagged and moved. I was asked to move my car toward the front. I went ahead and parked behind one of the cars in line for service, only to be asked to move the car again. Was given a service tag around 1005 and told to wait for an advisor, was finally helped at 1015...on the upside, recall service took less than 30 minutes, and there's a Starbucks coffee/chai latte/hot chocolate machine in the lobby.

Also, be prepared to get your email spammed with daily appointment reminders and deals for a new car.

...had the above review from about a week ago saved as a draft, wasn't planning on posting it, but after today's experience on the phone, they've lost me...Was told I needed an alignment done while getting my tires rotated at Costco. Tried calling Ontario Subaru's service department to get a quote on alignments, only to get held up verifying all my contact info is up to date then promptly transferred to an answering machine...< /text>

They are not like the typical dealer where they try to push you on the most expensive car, they want to make you happy and want you to be in the car that you love! The salesman that I had was so amazing and truly listened to what my husband and I wanted and were looking for in a car. They also did everything in their power to fight the bank as the bank was trying to give us a 24% interest rate, but they got the bank down to a 7% interest rate!!!! I absolutely love it here and they truly make you feel like family!!! I love my new Subaru Impreza and am so thankful that I bought from here!!! I very highly recommend going here for your car needs!!!!!< /Text>< Pictures>

They were so helpful and really tried hard to get me into the car that I chose.  I can’t say enough good things about them only that if you are looking for a straightforward dealership with no games then look no farther.  I will definitely be back for my next vehicle purchase.  I am a new customer on the Subaru vehicle product.  Ask for Adrian and say that Arturo sent you....</text>

I had a 7 AM appointment for routine service and was met by Matt Baker, who took car history, wrote up a quote and told me that it would be a 45 minutes wait. I went to the comfortable waiting area to read my paper. 43 minutes later the same Matt Baker came to tell me that my car was done and walked me to the cashier. After paying I left to walk to my car and as I passed the service area Matt Baker appeared and showed me to my car. I call this PLATINUM service by Subaru of Ontario! Thank you Matt Baker!< /Review>

I bought my car here and have been taking it here for almost a year now; so far, I haven't been disappointed. The service I get here is never bad and I don't feel mitigated by the staff. When I take my car in, I get updates on the status of my vehicle and appreciate how professional this establishment is. I'm very impressed and satisfied. Thank you very much! :)<//Review>

<review>Brought my car in for service, when I came to pick it up my door was crushed no adviser or mechanic said anything. They acted like they all had just found out, the door was fixed but couldn’t match my decals ,the service manager advised me go to my decal people to get it done and they would reimburse me. It’s been 5 months since it was done still waiting for them to send reimbursement they give you a big run around all there managers have been replaced so no one ever knows what’s going on. Wasted 2 days here Multiple hrs and still no check. Take your Subaru to San Bernardino or any other dealer besides this one customer service here is the worst!<//review><name>Jorge Urizar<//name>< resp>

It's been 13 days and counting to make arrangements with crystal. I have Spoken with Jenny many times. My husband has also left his cell number with her. Since no management ever calls back. Even after leaving multiple messages. This service department does not care to make sure your vehicle is well maintained nor care for your customer service. This location simply only cares if they sell vehicles. I believe Rocky is the only person at this location that truly cares about you.< /review>< pictures>

Worked with Aaron in consummating a deal on a Forester Touring model. Aaron honored his quote made via an internet query and the whole purchase experience was painless. Loved Aaron's enthusiasm for the product and his knowledge pertaining to the model as well. It was well worth the hour drive from Orange County to secure the price we thought to be fair.< /Review>

<text>To be fair, I've used them prior to this with no issue and would say the service I received to be on par with other service departments.

Today, I went in after scheduling an appointment 3 weeks prior.  When I arrive 15 minutes early for the appointment they asked what I was there for.  I tell them I had an appointment scheduled for an oil change and to fix the recall.  He immediately responds that they could not get it done today.  Confused, I state that I had made an appointment and stated specifically for stand by (which I've done previously).  He asks if I "just" made it, so I correct him and tell him it was made weeks ago.  He looks it up on the computer and finds my name and appointment time on the first page he brings up.  He replies that all the people who could do this were already gone for the day and I would need to go back online and schedule an appointment prior to 4 PM.

I'm frustrated but I try to be flexible and ask if they have a loaner car so I can leave it there and return to pick up the next day.  This is still a hassle for me because I now need to return again when we had agreed to just be the once.  To this the manager (or who I assume is the manager) states that they don't make enough money on an oil change to warrant a loaner car and besides they are all already gone.  Additionally he has already sent home all of this workers so there is no one here to help me but he tries to track down someone who is just pulling up from a test drive.  He agreed to fix the recall, but was "unable" to change the oil.  I resign to this and ask to get done what he can.

I ended up driving to Jiffy Lube to pay for an oil change that was supposed to be included in my new car purchase to prevent waiting another month to get an oil change which was due last week.  I am very disappointed in whatever changes took place there between my last time and this time.  It seemed his consideration of my time and his customer service to be lacking today.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Text>The people were really sweet, friendly and caring through out the whole experience. It did however leave a bit of a bad taste in my mouth that they did not fill my gas tank all the way to full like they said they would and they did not wash the car nicely. I had many streaks down my windows and mirrors. I do love my Subaru and it is really fun going on adventures with it.<//Text>< pics>

<review>Overall, their service was good. Some other guy came, while I was waiting to check in, pulled up to working station. But they did recognized I was there first. And they took me in first. This is little thing, but I feel they were treating me fair. It was just oil change. So, it was fairy quick. It was good experience. Making appointment was tough part. I had to wait 10days to get appointment. When I purchased the car, sales man said, no appointment is necessary. Just drop in, and they will take care anything right away. But that was not true. Because of fouls comment from sales man, I had to take 1 star off.< /review>< Pics>

Great customer service. The staff at Subaru of Ontario were very helpful, and went a above and beyond my normal expectations for a dealership. If You're in the market for a new vehicle, give them a chance first, no matter how far you are they will do their best to get you into what You're looking for.< /review>

My wife and I had an idea what we wanted to purchase, but fully expected to spend the next 3-4 hours at the dealership. Thankfully, we met up with Adrian Diaz who was extremely helpful and congenial, and we drove off in our new vehicle within two hours! Everything explained was concise, and everybody was accommodating for our precocious 4-year old son. This was the single best experience I've had purchasing a new vehicle.<//text>

Daniel T. helped me and my fiancé out. He was such a sweetheart and made us feel comfortable. He didn’t hover when we needed a private moment to speak. He wasn’t pushy. He helped us with what he could on getting our dream car. Thank you Daniel T.  The first car experience was enjoyable.  Along with Mike the finance guy. He was cool and made it an enjoyable experience.<//Review>

Ordered a replacement part for a defective radio. Took 2 months to receive it. After contacting Subaru of America, it turns out they had the part in the parts department for 30+ days and it was shipped back, despite the fact that I called every 3 weeks to check if they received it/if they would contact me when the part arrived.

I understood that it was on backorder, and had that been the only reason for the delay I might be grumpy about it, but still understand. But the fact that I had to wait an additional month despite my attempts to keep tabs on when the radio would arrive... that is some incompetence I have not seen before<//review>

<Review>Extremely unprofessional experience. I came to the service department to get my battery checked out on Monday and they told me it was completely dead and that I needed a new one. Therefore I purchase one and come to find out it’s not the battery that’s the problem so I have been calling since TUESDAY it is now Saturday and I was not spoken to by anyone at all. The only person I spoke to was the receptionist but my call would ALWAYS get transferred but NEVER answered! Yes I did leave voicemails with my phone number. I even left my email. I tried the online chat and they explained someone would contact me shortly, but eventually NEVER did!! I have been trying to contact someone all week long. That’s is absolutely absurd!! I work from 6am-7pm every day therefore it is not like I can simply go in. So I have to wait until today Saturday to drive all the way to the damn dealership, mind you I do not live 15 minutes away I live 45!, just for someone to tell me that I had to speak the the manager who is not there today!!! I wasted my time, and someone else time to bring the damn battery back to try to return it for nothing. If i would have been able to simply speak to someone on the phone who could have given me that information I wouldn’t have had to come over here for nothing!! I am extremely upset and very disappointed with the service here! Never again! If I could give a negative 3 stars I would.</Review>< Pictures>

They got the job done.  I have a 2015 Outback which has been leaking transmission fluid since I purchased it new in 2015.  It was a very slow drip and another dealer told me several times that there was no leak.
Finally decided to take it back to the dealer where I purchased the car.  At the first appointment they thought they had found the problem but unfortunately it kept dripping.
I took it back and left it.  They spent hours on it and finally found a hairline crack in the transmission case.
It was frustrating for them and for me but I am so grateful that they finally found the leak.
I have a new transmission and a clean garage floor.
Thank you service crew for all of your hard work.  An especial shout out to Matt who kept me informed throughout the week and had the job finished on time as promised.
These guys and gals are the best.<//text>

Great customer service. Easy buying experience. Did 90% of the purchase through text messages. Kevin in sales took all the headache out of buying a car. This was the easiest purchase I ever experienced. Thank you to the whole sales team and managers for the great deal and easiest purchase ever! #TeamSubaru<//Review>

< review>
This was absolutely the worst car maintenance experience ever. First, I was told that it would be two hours for my car to be done for only an oil change. I looked around and there were no cars being worked on at that moment. They took me to a nearby Starbucks to wait for my car to be done. I called the dealership.  I was on hold for 13 minutes until finally they sent me to the managers line. He did not answer, so I left a voicemail. He has yet to return my call. I had to walk back from the Starbucks to the dealership to go pick up my car. When I returned, my car was not ready. It looked as if they were waiting for an employee to get back from their lunch break to start working on my car. He was leaving just as I got there for my appointment.  Once he got there, he started the oil change. He just stared at the oil as it came out of the engine.  I asked them to go ahead and rotate the tires since that was a part of the deal instead of waiting for the oil change to be done and then rotate the tires (I was in a hurry at this point). So, they did.
In the end, it was a very frustrating experience. It would've been much different if the manager called me back and I didn't have to walk back to the dealership to get my car.
I bought my car from this dealership. This experience is making me question my purchase in the first place.<//review>

My wife and I have had been looking at Subaru for sometime and we finally decided to walk in on a Sunday (approx. two weeks ago). Adrian approached us and provided by-far the best customer service we’ve received at a dealership. Adrian was patient, extremely helpful and went well out of his way to help us feel comfortable about the whole process. We didn’t feel pressured at any moment, as a matter of fact, we felt guilty for all of the requests we were making. When it was time to leave, Adrian offered to take our picture with our new car in front of the dealership, it was great! Thanks Adrian! Thanks Subaru! We love our 2019 Outback!!!<//Text>

Marvin was great. Said it would be 11/2 hr for oil change and tire rotation. After 2 hours I checked on my car. It was still in the service dock.
Everything was fine except the 2 hour wait...for an oil change?  I even had an appointment ☹️<//Text>

I'm grateful Marvin was there to help out when I brought my car in for an oil change. I always enjoy seeing him when I bring my car in.
The dealership was overloaded with cars since several folks decided to come in after missing their appointments due to the rain, yet Marvin got me out of there in good time.
He is always so helpful and friendly!<//Review>

Overall we really like this dealership. We have bought two new Subaru vehicles in the past 3 years here. The first time was better than the more recent purchasing experience.

The test-drives were easy to arrange, options easy to understand, hardly any hidden fees and they were pretty upfront about the available plans. Minor annoyance was pushing a color we were not too crazy about. I was led to believe a color was available on a dealer-to-dealer swap but received no information about it. Upon coming in, the color we spoke about was not available and instead we got $500 off the color we weren't originally interested in.

Other than that, the service on our vehicles we receive here are good.< /Review>

I just picked up my new beautiful sepia bronze Forester this past weekend.  Not only am I super happy with my car but also with my online purchasing experience.  During my online searching a couple months ago, I came in contact with Diana Luce. Although I had read the best deals are to be found online, I wasn't sure how I felt about not actually being physically at a dealership and meeting someone face to face.  My doubts disappeared when I began talking to Diana.  I felt very comfortable with her candor and relaxed nature.  She was absolutely there to help me get the car I wanted at the best price - which meant having to order it. During the ordering process she was great at calling and emailing to keep me updated on the status of my car.  It was a very smooth and stress free purchase.  Thank you Diana and Subaru of Ontario!< /text>

Pedro was great at helping me find the Outback in the trim and color I wanted.  He spent several days contacting other dealerships in the area to retrieve the car I wanted and eventually picked it up from San Bernardino.  He was really easy to communicate with, responsive, and overall very helpful and involved in the whole process.  10/10< /text>

BUYER BEWARE! Horrible customer service. We purchased a Subaru, the experience was great. BUT.. My husband and I were disappointed in the lack of customer service and quality of service repairs. We experienced delays in the car being serviced, promised times for pickup missed, inspection of car was inconsistent resulting in having to take the car back, long delays sitting at the dealer. We ended up trading in the car on a different car, different brand. Our Sub was still under warranty, but didn't trust the brand, it wasn't backed by their own service. To us, it's the whole packaged and if we're treated like second rate citizens after the buying experience, then the trust is broken, and the loyalty lost.   It's been six months and we still do not have the refund from the dealer. We've attempted to call, leave messages, email without response, and when we did get ahold of a person, Michael in Finance, he seemed to care, but then didn't follow up with us, said he call back by the end of the day, the call never came. We tried escalating to the Finance Manager, spoke with "Veit"?. He was rushing me, dismissing off the phone, trying to transfer me. He placed me on hold, said he was calling the cancellation group, and told me the check would be out to us in 10 days. Three weeks later, no check, sent an email, left voicemail for "Veit" - nothing.  I would think twice about purchasing SUBARU. They sell a good product but don't back it  - BUYER BEWARE!</Text>

I went to three different reputable tire company's who told me I had to buy 4 new tires which I understand with the all wheel drive but they told me that the tread on my tires were all different 5's and 6's. I took my car back to the dealership and they looked and my car and said that wasn't true that they were 7's .  I asked for them to put it in writing.  Their document showed that the two front tires treads were a 5 and a 6 and the back two were 7.  Their manual states all four tires must be the same in terms of manufacturer, brand(tread pattern) construction and size. And that you are advised to replace the tires with new ones that are identical to those fitted as standard equipment. For safe vehicle operation Subaru recommends replacing all four tires at the same time.my vehicle is supposed to be certified preowned not sure why they would sell me car that does not meet there recommended standards and then refuse to replace all the tires.  Well I highly recommend not purchasing a vehicle from this location nothing but crooks. They refused to do anything to make this right.  The managers offer was,  for me to pay half for a new tire that they would shave down to match the back tire.

Recently purchased a used 2017 Impreza hatchback. Overall experience was stress free and pleasant. I drove from north county just to purchase this vehicle, it was everything I hoped for. Shout out to Bryan Johnson, the salesman that helped me out, who was patient and super informative and answered all the questions that helped me decide to actually go through with purchasing the car. Just an overall wonderful experience at Subaru of Ontario. Thank you!< /Review>

Service was good but there were challenges getting the appointment. I went through “chat-help” to set appointment. System was down and I was asked for my contact phone to call me back. Never got the call-back..< /review>

Austin Day came out to the house as part of the "Subaru Love Encore" program. He showed me several things about the car (known and unknown) I had no idea that my 2020 Subaru Outback could do. He helps you set it all up. A great experience, definitely worth taking the time to do. I highly advise every owner to sign up for this 90 minute preview. Also...shout out to Amber Arias (Internet Sales) for selling me my 2nd Outback. This model has it all. SHE is a great salesperson...go see her.</Text>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>Probably one of the most unprofessional service people I have ever spoken to.  My car was having trouble starting at 31k miles while still under warranty so I knew it was the battery dying, you could also tell because the OEM battery was leaking.  So I called to see if I can stop by to get my battery replaced under warranty and they told me no,  I have to make an appointment otherwise, wait 3 hours to get it swapped out. 3 hours!! for 2 screws and a new battery.  The appointment they gave me was also a full week out. Keep in mind, the car is already struggling to start.  An hour later, I got stranded on the road and the person that claims to be the service manager didn't even care. And told me to go to a different dealer.  Don't be fooled by the 4 stars on Google, check their YELP page and you can see all the complaints were about their poor service.  Take the "service advisor's" advice and go to another dealer .< /review>< Name>

We heard nothing from Service and so started calling around 2:00 pm. We could get no answer from the Service Line. I left a message asking for a call back. We received no information. Finally around 3:30 we tried calling the dealership phone and got no answer there either. Finally, in desperation, I called the person that had sold us the Outback about 7 months previously, and she was VERY helpful. She walked back to Service to see if she could find out what was happening. She found out that the car was not yet ready but should be soon.
Shortly after we ended the call with our salesperson, Service called us back to say that the car would be ready between 4-4:30 pm.
We then left to pick up our car but were now in afternoon LA traffic and it took us an hour to get to the dealership. The reason we wanted an early service time was to avoid this traffic.
When we arrived, the car was obviously ready, so I went in to the cashier to get a release for the car. She could not even tell me if anything unusual had been found, etc. so I had to go back to Service and wait in line to find out that all was well with the car.
All in all, this was probably the worst experience we have ever had with car servicing. We even started to worry that the dealership was closing as we could not reach ANYONE at the dealership.
We will not be going back to this dealership but will try to find another one in our area that has some semblance of service available.<//Text><rating>1<//rating><user_name>Mary Johnson< /user_name><userid>114785814731069285456< /userid></record></dataset><record>

I made the mistake of not reading the reviews before scheduling the service appointment.  We've purchased two Subarus from this dealership in the last couple of years and have nothing but positive comments to make about the experience.  Unfortunately, when you read the reviews on both Google and Yelp, it is obvious that this dealership has a profound problem with their service department and they appear to have little interest in solving the problem.  Today, we dropped off our car for an 8:30 appointment and by 3 PM they hadn't even bothered to look at it. No  commitment over the phone to do anything on the day of the appointment.  Yesterday, we brought in the other Subaru for a minimal service and was told that new rear brake pads and a transmission service were needed, but on the service record/invoice, no indication of how much pad material was left on the rear nor on the front. No indication why a transmission service was needed.  We proceeded with both because of prior great experiences with the service and sales departments, but after today and reading the reviews, I regret bringing in both cars.   We will move our business to another dealership.

I do love my Subaru, though!<//Review>

This was the best car buying experience ever. Aaron Brown was fantastic. I told him what I wanted and that I did not want to do the "dance" back and forth. We did the deal over email, filled out the paperwork on line. When I arrived the car was washed, with a filled tank waiting for me. My wife went in and signed the paper work in about five minutes, and left for an appointment, and I was about 30 minutes behind her. Greatest treatment ever. This is how to buy a Subaru.</review>

I had a great experience with the service department. They made what could have been a nightmare turned to a very pleasant experience. Having car issues has always been a pain especially when you deal with dealerships, however they made case simple and easy.

Marvin in the service department is a very pleasant and honest person to deal with. He made it clear and was always there during the process. A very patient guy who understood what people need....and that is Service.

Highly recommend this service company.

Not a good experience; as soon as they noticed that I was not easy to close, the salesperson ignored me and left the desk where we were negotiating, and basically kicked me out of the Dealer. Today 4 days later, I went to St. Mina dealer and purchaser a car with an excellent service and respect.</Text>

<date>1500561212809</date><Review>Easily one of the best car buying experience ever. Originally, I wanted a 2017 forester and they had it in stock at their sister store. We discussed the price over email and it was agreed to. Got emailed a few minutes later and turns out the sister store already reserved it for another customer, but they said they were going to get the 2018 in about a month. A month later, I was contacted about the new forester. We discussed pricing again and I arrived a couple of days later since the car was not ready yet (just off the transport truck) to test drive. Decided I love the car after the test drive and made the deal. No surprise or hidden fees. No pressuring and pestering if I wanted the extras which i declined. The whole process took about 1.5 hours.<//Review>< rate>

<Name>Laurie Francis</Name><rate>1</rate><review>The service communication at this dealership is the worst I've ever experienced.  Three times I've needed a part ordered while having my vehicle serviced for other issues and all three times I had to follow up on the status of the ordered part on my own only to find out that since nothing was done with it the part was sent back.  It's gotten to the point that I dread having to have the dealer do anything because it ends up taking months before it's finally completed.  When they do finally service the vehicle, they are courteous and apologetic but then it happens again.  I wish there were more Subaru dealerships around so I have other options.  Very frustrating!!!!< /review>< date>

Subaru of Ontario has a very professional service department that provides high quality service at a reasonable price. Always feel like the routine maintenance service is tailored to the car; never more or less work on the car than is needed.  Work is fairly fast compared to other service departments experienced over the years.< /Review>

<review>I took my 2015 Outback in for an oil change and tire rotation. The service was done quickly, the service representative was very nice and they had the car back to me within an hour and 20 minutes. They even washed the car for me. The cost was very reasonable compared to other alternatives such as Jiffy Lube. My only complaint was a service technician left a grease mark on the interior headliner near the door frame.< /review><time>1511972937029< /time><user_id>111079418787798798026< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

Walked in with no appointment to get my vehicle seviced. I was assisted right away and my vehicle was taken back for an oil change.

The service took about an hour, including oil change, tire rotation, and car wash. The waiting area is very nice with complementary water, coffee, and popcorn.

Special thanks to the service clerk Tiffany, she was very helpful in getting my vehicle serviced.<//review>

Daniel was THE MAN at Ontario Subaru. I had already been to 3 different dealerships and hands down Daniel was the best I have ever met. He was super nice and went into great detail about every aspect of my legacy. Made things easy and made sure I left with what I wanted at a great deal. You should see this guy if you want to have a good experience.</Review>

Matt is great in the service dept. He took car of my car fast and made sure I was taken care of the whole time I waited. I learned my lesson trying to service my car elsewhere... I'm definitely sticking with Matt and service in Ontario in the future.<//Review>

It was a pretty painless car buying experience, I was not expecting to trade my 2015 WRX after doing a service but, I had already been in contact with the sales woman, to schedule a test drive for that day. Went on a test drive, like the vehicle, got what I was asking for my trade-in and walked away with a great deal after going back and forth in negotiations. Great experience, the saleswoman was a delightful!< /text>

Subaru of Ontario treated me so well when I went to go look for a new car. At first I had my sights set on a 2017 Crosstrek, but after walking around the lot a little,  I then had my eye on a used Forester. But after talking to Rocky earlier in the day and coming back to work with David - they both worked with me on finding the perfect car. I told Subaru specifically what I was looking for and they offered me exactly what I had in mind (and around the price range I had set). The customer service and atmosphere at Subaru of Ontario was great and I couldn't be happier with my purchase!<//review>

This is where I purchased my current Subaru Outback.  The price was fair and the car has been great.  The people in the service department go out of their way with scheduling, warranty work, and helping the customer to save money.  Highly recommend.<//Review>

My brother purchased a car from them about a year ago and it really made me interested in buying a Subaru. I test drove the car in San Bernardino and it was a horrible experience!! But as soon as I walked into the Ontario location I was completely turned around.

I am glad I am a Subaru owner. Staff at Ontario are extremely professional, courteous, and helpful. They even dropped my daughter and I off at the mall one day as our car was being serviced. Kim in the service department is wonderful!!

Many thanks to all :) !<//text>< date>

Thank you, thank you, thank you!  We had an emergency need for a transmission bolt on a car for our [disabled] friend who lives in Arrowhead.  I text Ontario through Google maps & got an immediate response, as time was of the essence.  We had called closer Subaru dealers (Riverside, San Bernardino), but they were not willing to help at all.  Only Robert at Ontario was willing to leave the part with the cashier after hours.  We drove 50 mins one way to pick it up, and it allowed us to fix her car (until 9pm).  Robert saved the day!  Kudos for going the extra mile to help us.<//Review>

<text>In short: They did work on my car without my consent, did not do any diagnostic work that I paid for until after I called back for the SEVENTH time and was put through to the manager, and still returned my car filthy with oil stains on the tan interior with loose wires (after I was charged for "car detailing" as part of my invoice).

The long story: My boyfriend had brought his Impreza here to get his breaks done and had a good experience, so we brought in my 2005 Forester after it overheated. There was an apparent crack on the top of the radiator, as well as a leak on the driver side of the engine, both of which I brought up while dropping it off. They said initially they would do a full diagnostic of the engine/breaks/etc. which would cost $129, but be applied to the cost of any repairs needed. Three days after dropping it off, they call to inform me about the crack in the radiator, and told me it would be $800 to fix. Very concerned about spending too much money on an old car, I called them back three different times to get more information about the rest of the engine, including the apparent leak, and was promised every time I would receive a call back with information before they moved forward on the fix. They called five days later informing me they had repaired my radiator (without my consent) and that my head gaskets were blown as well - a fix estimated at around $2,800. I was finally put through to the manager, Paul, who did finally get the shop to actually do a full diagnostic, and after three calls was able to tell me where the leak was coming from. He offered me a discount and was active about communicating with me which I appreciated. I was feeling less frustrated about the experience and just ready to get my car back (after over TWO weeks in the shop and hemorrhaging money), but when I finally got it, it was in such garbage condition that it just reinforced how frustrated I was, and their lack of attention to detail. There are cords hanging down from below the glove box, oil hand prints all over the tan material, and the car was extremely dusty inside and out from having sat there for so long. They have since offered to wash my car, but the kicker was that when I re-read my invoice, they already charged me for a car wash.
One star because my car runs, one star because Paul tried pretty hard. Unless you like throwing money away and not receiving the service you're paying for, I would not recommend coming here for service on your vehicle.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Gmap_id>

Right from the inquiry, Edwin was very helpful in getting my first car, exactly the color and trim that I wanted. He made my experience feel like I was a part of a family, and not just business. He went through all the important topics with me about the car to make sure I didn't miss anything important. I definitely recommend this place if you are looking to buy a car.

Pleasant and simple buying experience, no hard push and understood what I was looking for.

Their service is reliable too.  Took car in for oil change and rotation and it was found one of my bolts was bad.  They fixed it no problem, told me about it right away, and were very courteous.

Service department is adequate.  There's only 2 service people working at a time so there's a wait to drop off your car sometimes.  They do offer rental car if you have to leave the car for a long time and you need to go to wok.</review>

The sign to this Subaru dealership is so low on the ground, might as well hide it. Once I finally managed to find it, it took a while to be acknowledged. I know I don't walk in the limelight, but jeez. Dear Subaru, some dealerships will greet you the moment you enter their parking lot.</Review>

I've had a great experience with Subaru of Ontario. I purchased my 2017 Subaru Forester XT Touring back in August 2016 and have brought in the vehicle for two oil change services since owning the car. They were very straight forward and offered great communication in the purchasing process. I haven't had any issues when bringing in the Forester for service. I highly recommend this dealership if you are looking for a Subaru in Southern California.</Text>

<Text>First time Subaru owners and so far we're two happy campers. So glad that we chose this auto dealer over the others who quoted us in True Car. They gave us the best price for our purchase value. They made the deal right and even better. We walked out the door with a clean fully-loaded Outback that came with a special deal on gold extended warranty. Special thanks to David Young and Aaron Brown for the accommodation. Now driving my Outback with pride. Just referred you to family and friends.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

This is my second visit to the dealership for service on my 2017 Outback, and so far I am very pleased. They are prompt with their appointment times, and on both occasions I have been able to wait for the service to be completed, as it was done in a reasonable amount of time.</text>

<review>Our experience with Subaru of Ontario, and particularly Diana Luce was outstanding from beginning to end.  We ordered a custom-equipped 2018 Crosstrek and it arrived earlier than anticipated.

Vince was nothing but helpful while we shopped around for our new Outback. He responded to every email about the car and made every effort to beat out other competitors on price and incentives. Michael in the finance department was informative and clear on extra warranties but never made us feel like he was pressuring us into anything that wouldn’t otherwise benefit us. Highly recommend.<//review>

Repairs themselves were fine, though I had to call back a second time to ask for a courtesy shuttle before it came.

Also, just odd i'd be quoted $35 to change the front right side marker light (which costs <$3 for the bulb itself), despite the fact that my right low beam bulb was already being changed and you get to both bulbs the same way.<//Text>

Amazing experience. My dealer David was very accommodating to my needs, patient, thorough, and hand-delivered the car to my home after picking it up from another dealership! The staff at Suburu of Ontario were all very kind, informative, and helpful for my first-time buyer experience.< /Review>

<user>112368939927650773449</user><rate>1< /rate><name>Gaja Andzel</name><Review>I rated this dealership after buying my new Subaru Forester in Sept 2016 FIVE STARS. My experience was just perfect! Coming back for my first service was..... a cold shower. I must say that if I knew what service I will be getting in the future I WOULD NOT PURCHASE MY CAR AT THIS LOCATION.
Problems
- I am quite busy and my time is valuable. I set my oil change appointment 2 months in advance. Upon arrival I was told it will take 2.5 to 3 hours.  I asked how come, since I had appointment etc. This is why: we are small service, many clients, busy,
I understand explanation like this when I walk in, but ... this was scheduled in advance!
- my previous car was Nissan purchased at Redland's dealership. The difference between service at Nissan and Subaru is like day and night. I got zero info on general car review, car not washed, waiting area comfort not comparable.
- I had 3 questions regarding use of my car: despite reading the manual etc I still can't figure out some of the functions, what irritates me. I asked car salesman on the floor, 2 car service reps, and no answers. Completely clueless.
- I had concern about doors and brakes. Something weird happened 2 times, and it would be great to have reassurance etc. Nobody ask if I have concerns etc. I felt that they want me out of there ASAP.
This is my 3rd review of my service experience, two previous were internal Subaru feedback opportunities.  I got reminders to provide google review x 3, each time I email back to Subaru in Ontario suggesting to stop reminding me / bugging me, as my review will not be positive. Reminders kept coming, what I found annoying. This is why, finally, I am writing this review.
Summary: I feel like I had great wedding (buying the car) but now I am in for horrible marriage time (service). I know I don’t have to come here, but … it is free for 2 years, and in theory this should be place where experts in my car are. I will try one more time.<//Review><response>{'time': 1475271275885, 'text': 'Thank you for sharing you recent experience with us, Gaja.

<Review>The staff here is very friendly and accommodating. The complaint my husband and I have is that when our vehicle was returned to us after the oil change and tire rotation is that the passenger side seat (along with the glove compartment and right side arm rest) had black dirty stains on it. Our vehicle has the white leather and my husband had to come home and spend some time cleaning the dirt off. So really the technicians have to be a bit more mindful about that. I give it 2 stars because of the time and inconvenience of having to clean those black marks off our white interior<//Review></record>

1. REV REWARDS- not really a big deal, but told us that we could use the rewards to buy parts in the service dept.
2. Told us our warranty wouldn't be void if we added aftermarket parts.
3. Last but not least- we were told that we had to purchase their extended warranty or Subaru would not finance the car for us. "Subaru Policy"

After being told the REV REWARDS and the aftermarket parts were not true- we did our research.: We found it's ILLEGAL for a finance manager to force a buyer to purchase their extended warranty in order to get their loan approved. Not only did he tell us that- but we found out there are several other complaints on this guy- Michael Cordona.

Also found out that you can cancel your warranty or renegotiate anytime. Dont be a VICTIM to this scam here at Subaru of Ontario.. I will not be buying my next Subaru here or Monrovia!

Agent was very flexible with services wanted/needed. Wasn't forced into unwanted expensive services for the mileage on my vehicle the day I went. Another great perk; my puppy was welcome to wait inside with me while my vehicle was being serviced. They washed my car before driving home. It was great!! Left with a smile on my face.< /text>

Prompt friendly service with Marvin, the service writer.   First experience with service department,  as this is a new vehicle in for our first oil change.   Tires rotated and vehicle washed in about an hour,  maybe less.   We will be back in the future.   Side note, this is not the dealer we purchased from but treated well regardless.<//text>

Thank you Chris Garchitorena for that long overdue upgrade! Excellent customer service from his part was actually waiting outside when I pulled up a few minutes after my appointment was scheduled. Went inside for a quick, no bs overview of the process, run down of all the buying information, and then a quick evaluation of my trade in. Literally in and out is what it seemed. He even took the time to go over all the features of the car and what to expect performance wise. Highly recommend seeing him if your in the line or prospecting a new Subaru! Ps thank you for assisting in removing my dashcam which was basically 3m welded to the windshield.<//text>

The service people are terrible. They have awful attitudes and just don't care.  I wish I had never dropped off my car there. Check out the Yelp reviews if you want to know how bad these people are. Apparently, their sales staff is okay, but I wouldn't want to buy from a dealer that treats customers like garbage in the service department.<//Text>

<review>Brought my 2019 WRX for a check up and to check on  mysterious green grease on the inside of my wheel. The service advisor Anthony asked me a few questions and told me that it won’t be done until the end of the day. I said no problem I can leave the car the whole day. Hours passed by it got closer to 7Pm ( the time the service department closes) I give Anthony a call, asked him about my car. Anthony gives me a “ oh yeah your axel boot is ripped we need to order the part and it won’t be done till tomorrow afternoon.”

(Next day)
I still don’t receive any call about my car being ready nor if they started the install of the new axle boot. I get off work around 4.. still no call I get home around 5 still no call. So I decided to go to Subaru I get there around 6:50 and I walk up to the cashier and to see if my car was ready.. and sure enough it was! I was ready since 4!

(On my way home)
On the drive home I start to hear a noise, I turned down my radio and sure enough it was coming from the same wheel that the axel got replaced. It sounds like I have bad breaks when I don’t ! All I hear is sheering.

If I could no start I would. Subaru of Ontario is a no go for me.. I’ll go use my warranty at A different Subaru from now on.</review><Name>Hugo Ruiz</Name></record>

Since leasing my '16 Forrester at Subaru of Ontario last March, I have brought my car in for regular servicing three times now. (I am a road warrior & have traveled quite extensively this year!) Each time, the servicing staff has been courteous, expeditious, and done a great job servicing my vehicle! I also love how easy it is to schedule my appointment online for quick in and out for my oil changes. Thank you and keep up the good work, Subaru of Ontario!</text>

I bought a Forester here a couple weeks ago, and everyone was so polite and helpful to my family and I. I knew an idea of what kind of car I wanted, and Francisco and Zhang did a great job helping me narrow down my choices to fit my budget and my needs. The process was typical of a car dealership, with the paperwork and all, but they made sure it was as seamless as possible. Thank you so much!< /Review>

<Review>I am a 70 yr old senior citizen. Over the last 40 yrs or so have purchased several new cars . As a result have had contact with shall we say a number and variety of service writers and results . Customer service and appreciation has returned . 3-30-2017 took my wife's 2016 in to Ontario Subaru for a scheduled appointment. I was immediately greeted by a friendly service advisor. We reviewed what needed to be done. I had a question about the bill and was told before final payment all questions would be answered. Not only was I treated with respect and appreciation, but all my questions were answered to my satisfaction, and one other small issue I did not mention when I made the appointment was immediately resolved.

It is nice to see customer service and customer appreciation are both still practiced.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1477981906829, 'text': 'We always love to receive great feedback. Bob, thank you for taking the time to leave us a review!'}<//resp>< GmapID>

I came to this dealership because I always wanted a Subaru but when they made the Hybrid Crosstrek it became a no brainer! Subaru of Ontario gave me a great deal and Chris Garchitorena was very helpful in assisting us with our purchase I would definitely recommend this dealership to my friends and family! I love my Crosstrek. They do owe me 1 bar on the gas tank though. But Chris said he will make sure he takes care of me on that. I will be back with an update on that.</review>

Met with Bryan Mercado explained that I was interested in the Impreza Premium 2.0 Hatchback, color, price range per month, what I was looking to put as down payment  and what was my credit score was, oh what day I wanted to pick it up, too.
That was Sunday, on Thursday the process was two and half hours from time I arrived to out the door with my Impreza. Thank you, Bryan. Special thanks to Aaron Brown.< /Text>

Went for double re-call work which I booked online and had to change once - Seamless.  They did it in the time estimated and the waiting area is pretty well stocked. I had expected a wash but... I would have opted out anyway had they asked, but they didn't. Chatted with the sales staff and walked around some other dealerships - not so good an experience at the Toyota place.<//text>

Where is the no star button? The customer service here is non existent, unless you are purchasing a car that day. I can’t get any call backs. I haven’t been able to set up any maintenance appts. Make sure you read all reviews on yelp and google before entering this location. Seems to be the norm with not getting any follow up help. CarMax had better service appts.</text>

Got a flat tire while driving on the 15FWY. At first the team was only able to check my car and make sure everything was still working correctly. Luckily for me, they had one tire that fit my car on hand that they were able to sell me and get me back on the road. Many thanks!< /review>

Came here to this dealership at around 8:30pm on a Thursday night just to look around or may do a quick test drive. I was planning to get the car on that weekend and want to see if they have my preferred color. I was helped by David and showed me around without any questions even though it was already late as they close at 9pm. He asked me what i was looking for and gave me a quick rundown of what they have including those that were just delivered and not even available on their website. On my way out he asked me if i want a good deal and who would say no to that question. So he then told me to give him a number and they will try to meet that price that i want. I thought it was just gimmick because he is a car salesman but he came back to me telling me that they can do the price i gave them. From there, they did all the paperwork and I was out of the dealership with a new WRX in just an hour and a half. This was done after their store hours and i appreciate the assistance they gave me. No drama during the whole process. I highly recommend this dealership.< /Review>

My husband and I purchased 2 new (2018) cars a week ago.  I loved that they had a good inventory for us to choose from and that they are NOT high pressure sales.  Our initial contact was Bryan Johnson who gave us the best deals!  We checked all the dealers in our area, LA County, and only Ontario had two cars that we wanted to purchase.

Bryan Johnson was super efficient, knowledgeable, nice, personable, with a good sense of humor during the purchase process which isn't a short period of time..  Test drive, two sets of paperwork, and two people to show around the cars.  And we both LOVE our Subaru Imprezas!

Michael Cardona did an impeccable job of creating two sets of accurate financial paperwork and created a great system to make our use of time very efficient.

All in all - it was 2 hours to Ontario, 1 1/2 hours home, and 4 hours at Subaru of Ontario.<//review>

< Review>
The people are nice enough, I assume the mechanics are competent, and I'm very happy with my car.  However, in the last 6 months, I have gone into to get an oil change and in both cases I made appointments with the service desk.  In both cases they did not even take my car into the garage for more than hour after the scheduled appointment time.  After this happened the first time, I made a 7 am appointment for the second visit -- it's the first of the day, so how can they be running late, right?  Wrong.  At 8 am I went to the service desk to complain about my car not even being in the garage yet, and then they took it.

I just do not understand how Subaru can run a business in this way.  They work so hard to make great cars, and then they are just garbage on the service side.  I don't want to take off work, drive 20 minutes each way, then have an oil change take 90 minutes.  Ridiculous!  I'm really annoyed and disappointed and can not recommend taking your car to their garage.  Find a local mechanic and have them take care of your car.</Review>

<Review>Very courteous service staff.  They were quick to get my car into the service bay while I was waiting.  Alan, the technician, also came into the waiting room twice to discuss with me about the issues and the solutions to make sure I was happy with the way he was going to address the issues.  He was also very courteous and accommodating.  Subaru of Ontario is a good place to have your Subie serviced.

Update:
The services of the Service Department deteriorated tremendously after my previous visit.  Therefore, I went to the Riverside dealership to have my Subie serviced.

A few weeks ago, I went back to the Ontario dealership again for an urgent battery issue because it was closer to my home.  I found out that the dealership has since had a new service team.  The two ladies in charge of the department were very courteous and accommodating.   They squeezed me in and replaced the battery even though I had no appointment.  They also kept me informed of the progress while I was waiting.  I like the dealership of Subaru of Ontario again will return for future service.</Review>< user>

I was extremely satisfied with the customer service I received from my sales person, Angelina Reyes.  In fact, she is the only reason I purchased my car at Subaru of Ontario.   I had talked to at least 5 other dealerships before calling Angelina Reyes and she impressed me the most.  She was extremely prompt and thorough throughout my buying experience.  Every time I had a question or concern she handled it right away.  Every time I spoke to her, she had a great attitude and made me feel like I was her only customer.  If it weren't for her, I would have bought my car at my local Subaru dealership 10 miles away (Subaru of Ontario is 30 miles away from me).  I was impressed with the staff at Subaru of Ontario and would definitely refer everyone I know to Angelina Reyes if they were in a market for a Subaru.< /text>

<pics>None< /pics><review>My car needed part replacement that's under warranty.  When I came they told me they need to order the part and will call to schedule the appointment.  The rep didn't call me until almost a month later.  I scheduled but I had to reschedule again and told them that it is to replace a part that they had already ordered.  When I went for my scheduled appointment, I was told that it should take about an hour.  I checked up back to the counter when it was almost an hour and was told that he has bad news that they returned the part back because it has been over 30 days since they ordered it.   There were so many breakdown in their service system.  They should have known when I called in if the part is still there and if not, reordered it and informed me.  2nd, Iwhen I checked in, should have known in their system that they no longer have the part and could have told me then to reschedule instead of waiting an hour.  3rd, the rep as soon as he found out could have informed me right away knowing that I have just been waiting there for a service that will not happen that day.  Hopefully, they will get it right the 3rd time I come back.< /review>< rate>

Update:
I called the deanship four times today (plus my wife called), and I complained about the service. Finally they gave me an appointment on Wed. At least when you complain a lot, then they will do something to help.

I do not like this Subaru dealership. First, you have to wait three to four hours to get your oil changed when you made an appointment ahead of time. If you have a morning appointment, you can basically do nothing all morning except wait for your car. Last time I was there they said they would take me home while I waited for the oil change, and pick me up when they were done, but they ever came back to take me home. Such a liar! The worst thing is that when I had a flat tire on Friday, they told me to come back in the following Wednesday to get the tire replaced. When I realized they did not tell me what time to come on Wednesday, I decided to call on Monday to find out when to come in on Wednesday.  They told me they could not find my appointment in their system. So I had to make another appointment for Friday--one week after I got the flat tire. The reason I did not make an appointment successfully was because the mechanic told me to come on Wed. and that he indicated he was the person to make appointments with. If the mechanic guys are not in charge of making appointments, they should at least let us know we need to make an appointment with a certain department before they commit they can do it on a certain day. Now I have to ride on my spare tire surpassing the number of miles recommended to drive on it and it is a brand new car. I don’t even think this auto center deserves one star. I have consistently had bad service here.<//review>

< Review>
Subaru of Ontario is by far the most genuine car dealership I have been to! The whole process of leasing my car was way more relaxed than I thought it was going to be. They truly treated me like I was a person instead of trying to take all of my money. Rocky and Javier were the ones I was helped by. They were sincere and up front when I got on the lot to when I drove off in my new Subaru Impreza. Thank you for everything! You best believe this will not be the last Subaru I have!<//Review>

<review>I worked with Diana in the internet sales office. She was easy to work with, no pressure. Got all the paperwork done but unfortunately there was a fuse problem with the car I had chosen, and it was not an instant fix. Another car of the exact same make and model was coming in the next day, so Diana had all of the paperwork redone with the new VIN number, and brought the car and the revised paperwork to my home to be signed! It was a let down to leave the first day without my new car but Diana went to great lengths to get the situation resolved.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>My last car was totalled by another driver and it put us in a bad spot. Even though the car had been paid off by insurance it hadn't cleared my credit yet. The team at SOO went above and beyond to help us out, even though we were first time customers to them. Diana Luce and her co-workers bent over backwards to get us into something that not only worked for us but that we really enjoy. My hat is off to them and I will definitely be  returning.</Text>< pics>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Very enjoyable experience, Amber was knowledgeable and before I even got to the dealership had two cars prepared for me to look at and test drive. She was also very patient and polite when I changed my mind and went for a forester instead, at 8 pm on Valentine's Day. Overall great experience and I would definitely buy from Subaru Ontario again.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Good selection. Pleasant sales staff. Good deals. Fair trade in on our high mileage Forester. We recommend asking for Rocky if you want a very nice, helpful salesman. No high pressure sales games experienced at this dealership. Very happy with our 2017 Forester. Drove a manual transmission Subaru since 1984 and was skeptical about the CVT automatic for all the mountain driving we do. The CVT works quite well uphill and downhill and I'm getting great gas mileage as well. If you live at high altitude where winters are cold, do yourself a favor and go for the winter package as we have for the last four or five Subaru purchases. There's nothing as great as heated seats in below freezing weather.< /Text>

I live in No. CA but was more than willing to fly down to Ontario and drive my new 2017 Subaru Forester 450 miles back. I found Subaru of Ontario's prices to be the most competitive in the state plus they had exactly what I wanted. Internet sales manager Brittanie Burner was gracious, efficient, helpful and acted with  great integrity.<//Text>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>Well purchasing a vehicle (19 ascent) from the dealership was kinda smooth. (On 9-30-19) We walked in and were greet by David. We requested a sales representative named rocky. Was told by David that he had the day off. As we were discussing the vehicle inside. We saw rocky. He Came by to say hello to us. We felt betrayed by David for not mentioning he was inside the building. He was in the restroom at the time. . We did leave purchasing the vehicle since the manger did work well with us on our numbers. He was great. Five stars for the manger. Now my one star is also for the parts department. This is by far the worst parts department I have ever had to deal with. I believe I'll be trading ascent now. obviously they dont not care if you vehicle is in good shape or not. During my visit(3-13-19) I mentioned my brakes are shacking  as I come down to san Bernardino from big bear. The rotors are already warped after 6k miles. I was told they are under warranty for replacement and need to change them asap. She mentioned the rotors where not in stock. She said she would order then and have them in by a week and also to schedule appointments to have them replaced within a week. She mentioned the rotors are warped due to the water being in them. We live in big bear were most of the winter is wet. So I can see how that can be a problem. I did called 5 days later and left a message with the parts manger on Monday (3-18-19) around 10 am. Have not heard back from anyone. This experience is very disappointing to my family and I. Lucky we have more then one vehicle we can use. The ascent is sitting in our drive way now. We are currently leaving for vacation. So I will address the matter when we return..<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80c34aa17f442b8f:0x4a0508565192b8a9< /gmapID></record>

First time car buyer. I went in alone to this dealership to look at a used car. I called ahead to see if the car was available which I highly suggest. As soon as I got to the lot everyone was very polite. A lot of smiles. And I got paid attention to right away. Diana was my sales associate. And she was so comforting and super helpful with making me feel comfortable. As soon as I realized she was just there to help me my whole view about car buying changed. I always was told don't let salesman talk you into this or that. But going in I was very informed with what I wanted to buy and what I could afford. Which is also something I highly recommend you do research on before you go to a dealership. Diana made it easy and fun buying it. She helped me get the prices I want. And even though the other staff was all so helpful. I really enjoyed my car buying experience here. I came in at 6 and left at 7:45. But the whole time flew by I didn't feel pressured and I didn't leave feeling taken advantage of. I left super happy with the dealership. The finance guy I dealt with was chuck. And that's where all my red flags went up. All these opinions tell potential car buyers beware etc. etc. Chuck honestly was so nice. He didn't pressure me to sign papers I didn't want. He was very clear about the rewards program they have at the dealership and he was very light hearted. He made great conversation and he put me at ease.

I can't recommend this dealership enough. They made me feel at ease. Thank you so much Diana and chuck. You guys were so amazing.<//Review>

Disappointing that this is Subaru  of Ontario's service. Service team has not contacted me in almost 2 weeks i'v left 2 vms and used there online chat associate  gave all my info just for an oil change and till this minute eve after contacting again yesterday nobody has contacted me. My kids and i love the subie nation, but this is the 1st time we don't feel part of the subie  family.

Sales team is amazing i refer my team there and out of 152, 4 sales in 6 months,b and my guys rave about them most recently Amanda.</Text>

First and foremost I want to thank Subaru of Ontario for their warm hospitality. Came in Friday with my puppy, and tons of love and affection were shown along with a subaru hat for my pup, as well as a first aid kit and collapsible doggie bowl.

This review is strictly for Jonathan J.
Jonathan is one of the newest sales rep at Ontario Subaru. I believe hes been there about 4 months. Although he may be a little rough around the edges, he is amicable and is eager to go the extra mile for you. He comes across as very genuine, even though he gets stretched in all four directions only bc he is the rookie and the vets like tugging at his chain any chance they get. He is also a kind hearted, positive young man who keeps his word and respects your time. I came in with a 2015 STI near 500whp and I walked away with a new forester sport. I had many reasons why it was time to move on, but in the end it all came down to customer service. My only wish was to have the general manager throw in the STI shifter for the forester as an homage to my STI - but apparently it was asking for too much.

Anyhow, if you are looking to purchase a Subaru, ask for Jonanthan. Let's help this rookie get on his feet.<//review>

<Review>Don't go to their service departments. They are really bad in getting the work done.

I made a appointment and bring in my 2012 Forester for airbag recall service.  The service took 2 hours to finish (not sure if it should take this long).  Then by the time I went home, I figured they disconnected my interior illumination light (subaru oem kit) and forget to connect it back.

I brought my car next day to have them fix the problem.   And that wasted me another 2 hours for that.  But you know what?  They forget to put the fuse box cover properly and the cover was loose in the engine compartment!!!  Lucky I was planning a trip and need to open the hood to charge the battery in the meanwhile to found this out.

I have no idea how they screw things up not once, but twice.  But I am totally lost confident to their service department!<//Review><GmapID>0x80c34aa17f442b8f:0x4a0508565192b8a9< /GmapID><time>1517015698820<//time>< userid>

<review>Took my Crosstrek in because the key was getting stuck in the ignition. It was there for 10 hours. Made an appointment and Dropped it off at 9:20AM. Called in asking for an update at 3. They said a part was being replaced and it would be done by 5. Got there at 5:30 and had to wait until 7:00PM before it was done.  When i booked by appointment they said they would be able to give me a ride to my work in claremont. But when i asked for the ride the service tech said i would have to find my own ride because it was too far.  They can only take me 10 miles, my work was 12.5 mile away and he wouldn't make an exception for the extra 2.5 miles. Pretty sure they completed all of the other cars there before working on mine even though i had an appointment. It was a simple part they had to replace and theres no way it should have taken 10 hours.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1541437375864, 'text': 'We regret to hear that you had a negative experience with us, but would appreciate the chance to turn your experience around, TJ.

< review>
Got our 2017 Subaru Forester here about a year ago.  Their free service for 3 yrs was a great sweetening deal compared to other Subaru dealers in the surrounding areas. And it just so happened one Forester with the exact features we wanted had been delivered that day and had only 4 miles on it.
We knew what we wanted so didn’t have any lengthy sales process - just got right to it.
It was almost closing time when we arrived- probably 9 or 930pm and the staff stayed and helped us without any pressure about closing time.
I had originally planned to buy outright, but the manager encouraged us to lease since we would be using primarily for business purposes and the entire lease is deductible.  The buyout value at the end of the lease would also be lower than resale value if we took good care of it, so that meant also meant we’d get a credit towards a future one.  This was great advice and council for us and we’re glad we did lease.
It was about midnight by the time the paperwork was done and we could drive off and the staff were great the entire time.
They gave us a $50 gas card if we would return a different day for new owner training, and we obliged.

We found when we got home that the protective cargo tray mat in the back was defective and too small for the space.  We also noticed a few scuff marks inside on the fabric.
When we went back in for new owner training, they cleaned up the scuff marks for us and even though they’d never seen this mat issue before and were quite baffled by it, they found us a replacement that fit. They also found 2 other defective ones in the process but stuck with it until they got us a proper one.

When we purchased I was skeptical about the service as I’d read so many negative reviews here, but I’ve now had 2 official service appts and have been very satisfied with them.
The online scheduler did not seem to work right, so I call and schedule by phone.
They’ve gotten my car in promptly both times and had it ready within an hour.

I had a tiny paint touch up that was needed and they put it on for me.
Most all of the staff have been kind, pleasant, and very approachable, and on the rare occasion I first get someone who isn’t knowledgeable in what I need they quickly find me someone who is.

We’ve put 12000 miles on the car in a year and love it!

The only problems I’ve experienced are these:
The sales guy told me he’d call me to schedule the new car training, but he never did.  I had to call in and was basically told to just come in whenever was good for me.  So I did and all was fine.

When I ordered the touch up paint, they never called to tell me it had arrived.  I called and checked a few weeks later and it was there on hold for me.

Overall I’ve had very positive experiences and highly recommend this dealer!< /review>

The reason for 1 star is once you have purchased from them, their service is absolutely horrible.  They do not care about their customers. I bought my Subaru in August, 2018,  financing with Subaru of Ontario and buying additional packages, due to how great they said they would service you.
So my problem:
I have contacted them 6 times to get a simple question answered. Nobody can be bothered contacting me. 1st time no answer, 2nd time left message for Business Manager, 3rd time went through online chat left my email and phone #,  4th  and 5th times left voice messages for the service department. 6th time (day 4) Called roadside assistance department - and guess what they go home at 5 p.m.
I have a cracked windshield I have called 4 days in a row to get a simple answer - A. With the extra packages we purchased with the Subaru is the windshield covered (we paid like $3000.00 for several different extra programs.) B. If not, what is the price for getting it replaced. I don't want to schedule service for an amount that I don't know. Without a quote I am at the mercy of the dealer setting any price they want.
In comparison I was to able to get a quote from every other window replacement company, actually received four within 30 minutes from Yelp, and then two additional ones from larger glass companies on their websites. However, the people I paid $35,000.00 to that promised the world with the purchase cannot be bothered to take 5 minutes to respond.
Secondary issue that I would not have commented on publically, but since I am here - We had a recall which we scheduled an appointment for. I turned up 10 minutes prior to my appointment. It took 30 minutes after my actual appointment time to check in. Now the service at that point of check in, getting the car taken care of and pick-up was good. However, as a customer coming in  because of a manufacturer defect, a 30 minute wait for a scheduled appointment ,again shows the absolute lack of respect for their customers. My time is also valuable. I had someone else waiting on me, we had plans scheduled - based on a promised time that was not honored which we almost missed. Highly unacceptable.
My advice - do not buy a car here. They have zero ability to be helpful.</text>

No organization in service department,  line of cars and they do not attend customers in order they come in. I asked for shuttle service, was told they would check to see if it was available,  plus they couldn't warranty a pick up. Regret buying a car here, never again.<//text>

<Review>This dealership does not take their customer's privacy seriously. I, myself, have never been to or bought a vehicle at this dealership. However, they erroneously assigned my e-mail address to one of their customers.

In April 2018 I received a service reminder e-mail. I thought it was odd, so I clicked the "Unsubscribe" link and was taken to a screen where I could see the name, phone number, address, and vehicle information for this customer. I informed Paul Hayley, Service Manager, of their mistake and the clear lack of responsibility to their customer's privacy. I received a response telling me that the IT team had been notified and expected that to be the end of it.

Fast forward to now and I am still able to see their customer's private information and am still receiving e-mails meant for them. Since these e-mails are asking for feedback, I figured I would give some feedback.</Review>< UserId.>

<text>I’ve been at Subaru for over 30 mins waiting to check in. No one has even come to my car to say hello. Or it will be awhile. I got out and asked the guy inside. He says there busy. He said I see you looking at me. I must say this is the first time that the service has been rude and sucks.
At 50 minutes I was motioned to move forward. Prior to that I was sandwiched between cars and could go no where.
Finally at 1 hour I am greeted and my service should take an hour.
I’m just disappointed in their common courtesy!</text>< Date>

I went in today to have my 2018 STI headlights replaced under warranty because part of the housing inside is melting.

My appointment was at 9am and my car wasn't seeing until 9:30am.

About 10:45am the service advisor tells me that there's nothing wrong and that it's normal and part of the design. So I speak with the tech and he tells me the same thing. The tech even shows me another car of the same year and make and it has the same issue. The service advisor also showed me one of the showroom cars, but that car didn't have that issue. How is melting a part of the design and normal?

I'm truly disappointed in how they failed to acknowledge it as a problem. Not only is this a design flaw, but a safety and fire hazard. This dealer completely disregards one's personal safety on the road, which is sad because Subaru is all about being safe.<//text>

< Review>
After being bullied by what appeared to be a finance manager in San Bernardino, we stopped by Ontario expecting similar treatment but we were pleasantly  surprised.   Within 10 minutes we were quoted a price on the car we’d decided on that was nearly $3,000 less than San Bernardino had told us and almost $4,000 less than s ticker price. No haggling, no discussion, just a great price. We had to wait as we wanted a popular color but when we came back in everybody treated us like important customers and we were don in about 90 minutes. I was shocked as I used to work at A Subaru dealership 20 years ago and we worked more like the high pressure San Bernardino lot. They even turned down the overhead radio in the lobby for me so I could hear better.  Two weeks after buying the car I sent a message to ask a question and they answered within an hour!  Highly, highly recommended.  Best car buying experience I’ve ever had.< /Review>

Having problems with vehicle after 18,000 miles.  We have had it in 3 times for a sensor problem. The major problem is my wife driving the vehicle cannot regulate her core temperature after Chemo and Radiation. When the sensor goes out, A/C, speed control, etc. all shut down.  I got it back last week after the 3rd return for the same problem and found the fog light was now out.  They fixed it immediately and that was great.  Subaru corporate is reviewing the case at the present time.  I am hoping they do stand behind their vehicles.  The dealership is great, and the service people are fine, the vehicle is the problem now.</Text>

<Text>Sold them my Impreza today, which I bought from them 4 years ago.
The manager and the staffs are  nice, honest and professional.
Good resale value of Subaru!  One offer and it's a done deal !
They know the car is well kept and maintained by themselves!

5 minutes evaluation on the phone, bringing in the car,
and I got my full-amount check within the next 15 minutes!

And they even offered a free ride to send me back home!

A very pleasant experience in dealing with them for the last 4 years!

They wouldn't let me test drive a second car unless I filled out tons of forms. They already had my personal info due to purchase a few years prior. Will never buy from them again.<//review>

<Review>I went to get an oil change from this dealership and they did not afix the oil pan back on the bottom of my vehicle. This lead to my steering column locking while I was driving and the pistons to warp. The engine started to smoke while was in it.  I eventually contacted the dealership and told them what happened they fought me on the accountability of the situation.  They blamed me on me taking the pan out.  The dealership in Las Vegas was helpful and told me that the engine is damaged.  I was rudely told that I had to wait till Monday and I still haven't gotten a call. I don't know where my car is or if it is being fixed.</Review><user>108933108988492435413<//user>< Pictures>

<gmap_id>0x80c34aa17f442b8f:0x4a0508565192b8a9< /gmap_id><text>Made appt for airbag replacement.  Waited almost 1/2 hour in line past appt time before service rep was able to process car. (Apparently very busy day). Was told they may not have airbag, even though I made appt several days in advance of bringing car in, but they were able to locate 1 left that would fit my vehicle. Was told would take 2-3 hours to replace it, so they gave me a ride home (nice!).  5 hours later wondering why I still didn’t have my car.  Called dealership several times, and got automated message to leave VM for service dept. which I did. (no real person answered, and calls never returned.)  3rd call (6 hours after dropping it off) finally got a real person and was told if my car was done, they would have called me. Shortly thereafter, service rep called and said car was done.
Pros: did offer rental car if they didn’t have airbag available, shuttle service is nice otherwise I would have wasted a whole day at the dealership. Service rep was friendly.
Cons: calls not returned, no real person to answer phone for first 2 calls, took way longer than expected (and promised) to get my car back.<//text>< user>

This is the second time I have leased at Subaru Ontario. Cherly Sauer helped  us out both times. She is the best. Absolutely NO usual sales pressure whatsoever, very straightforward, provided all the information/advice that we needed and got us the best deal both times. Javier in finance was pretty cool as well.<//text>

<Review>SUBARU OF ONTARIO HAS ABSOLUTELY THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD. MY 2014 SUBARU CROSSTREK HAS 96,000 MILES AND HAS BEEN BURNING OIL FOR 3 MONTHS. I SCHEDULED A SERVICE TO INSPECT AN OIL LEAK AND THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT ASSURED ME AT INSPECTION THERE WAS NO LEAK AND THAT I NEEDED TO PAY FOR A CONSUMPTION TEST.  SUBARU OF ONTARIO HAS CHARGED ME UNECCESSARY FOR OIL CONSUMPTION TESTS TWICE AND EVERYTIME I AM THERE AND WITH A SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT THEY TELL ME THEY CANNOT HELP ME. THEY ALSO TELL ME THERE IS NO MANAGER I CAN SPEAK TO. SO FAR THEY HAVE CHARGED ME TWICE FOR OIL CONSUMPTION TESTS AND REFUSE TO COMPLETE THE TEST, NOW THEY SAY THERE IS AN OIL LEAK AND THEY CANNOT PERFORM CONSUMPTION TEST. MARVIN AND CARL IN THE SUBARU OF ONTARIO SERVICE CENTER ARE THE RUDEST AND MOST UNPROFESSIONAL SERVICE TECHS I HAVE EVER MET. THEY DOWN TALK THE ENGINE AND CARL (WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE A SERVICE MANAGER) TOLD ME I WAS LUCKY TO GET 100,000 MILES OUT OF MY 2014 CROSSTREK ENGINE! HAD I KNOWN THAT I NEVER WOULD HAVE PURCHASED IT! MY KIA SPECTRA GAVE ME 298,000 MILES!  MARVIN SAID THE ENGINES WERE MADE OF STYROFOAM AND KNOWN TO BURN OIL. MARVIN ACTUALLY RECOMMNEDED I LET THE ENGINE BURN UP AND THEN CALL 1800-SUBARU3 FOR A REPLACEMENT. CARL SAID THEY WILL NEVER REPLACE IT, THERE IS NO SUCH WARRANTY ON SUBARUS. I HAVE NEVER FELT WORSE ABOUT A VEHICLE PURCHASE. I AM STILL BURNING OIL  AND WHILE I DID CONTACT 1800-SUBARU3 TO REPORT THIS TERRIBLE SERVICE. THEY TOO HAVE DONE NOTHING TO HELP ME GET A QUOTE OR FIX MY “LEAK” OR “OIL BURNING” UNBELIEVABLE. NEVER BUY A SUBARU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!< /Review><Time>1546277649013< /Time>< resp>

< Review>
Service department did excellent. Had some trouble identifying an overheating problem through various mechanics, but eventually (it did take some time), these guys found the problem and took care of it. Brian is an especially nice guy who makes you feel taken care of and definitely does not try to upsell you or deceive. Thanks a bunch!</Review>

<name>K And<//name><review>This is the second Subaru I have purchased from Subaru Ontario. First off I would have given a 5 stars, but I waited 3 days to be contacted back with an “internet price” after calling multiple times, leaving messages and sending emails, and finally speaking to someone to never have my call returned. The car they had was a forester “black edition” which Is hard to come by, so I didn’t really have a choice besides driving a few hours to get what I was looking for. I finally drove down to the dealership and took matters into my own hands. I will say I was pretty upset when I walked into the dealership. I was greeted by Rocky who listened to my frustrations and helped to smoothe everything out. Because of Rocky, I had a 5 star experience. He was very patient and apologetic at what I had been through. I would recommend anybody to go see Rocky if you want an easier car buying experience. Side note: I would give zero stars to the internet sales lack of responsiveness to a customer for 3 days and the other salesman (I won’t mention any names) who neglected to follow up with me after he told me he would call me back. In the future I will return to this dealership but only if Rocky is my guy.</review></record>

< review>
Have you ever walked into a dealership and felt pressured buying a car? Well at Subaru of Ontario you will have a great experience! No pressure at all!
I came in a few days ago on New Year's Eve! Hands down to Sales Associate Pedro V., he definitely went all out to help us get the best deal for a WRX 2018! Believe it or not, we laughed, joked around, and simply felt like we were family! Something I've never experienced before!

Pedro V., went beyond what his job description entails to get the best offer for my brand new WRX! He was very genuine and did not play the numbers game like most sales persons do. Really, its simple math and Pedro had no problem breaking down those numbers for a better understanding. Trust me! Pedro will hustle, you won't be disappointed!

Also, let me add that I had several sales people assisting me to buy my car; Pedro, Francisco, and David. They were all very friendly, helpful, and patient. Most important there was no pressure. They all showed interest in helping with your budget.However, I highly recommend Pedro V since I did most of my interaction with him in making this purchase. Also, many thanks to the Finance Manager, Javier, who was very helpful and generous! Really, I'm very happy to be part of the Subaru Family!

Thank you so much!</review>

<text>Poor customer service.

If there was a zero, I'd pick it.  On 7/30/18, my son and I drove from Palm Springs to buy a 2016 WRX only to be treated with utmost disrespect. We were passed around from one sales person to another.  The manager did absolutely nothing to help out though he was standing a few feet away.  They must have assumed we were not ready to buy though my son has a significant down payment and great credit.  Sucks to lose a willing and able customer. We should have started at Palm Springs Subaru. At least they treated us like humans.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

In addition, he said it would take about two hours and it was just about 2 hours to the T when we called letting me know everything was ready. When going to pick it up, I discovered they washed my car as well, and didn’t charge me for it, or even letting me know they did. Even though it is part of their job, there’s some humility they all seemed to carry. Good job subaru!<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1528814974255, 'text': "Thank you for your kind words and this wonderful review, Vince!

They're great people and they did my oil change fast. Only thing I wish they did was wash your car afterwards like some other dealers do for even the smallest service purchase.< /review>

<Text>When I brought the car in, I  waited at least 15 minutes before someone was available to take my information.  My car was not ready for 90 minutes after the time promised, and I had an appointment.  Two screws were left on the floor after they worked on my dash.  That makes me wonder if things were put back correctly.</Text>< Pics>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>Ontario Suburu gets 1 star because that is the lowest rating.  I bought 2 new Outback Limited 3.6 cars there over the past 2 years, and I bought a third Outback Limited 3.6 elsewhere because Ontario could not give me the car I wanted and refused my trade in.  My present complaint is regarding service.  I phoned them no less than 10 times yesterday for a service appointment and finally just left a message on their answering machine, which was finally returned 24 hours later.  They could not service my car at any time next Tuesday despite my attempting to make the appointment on Thursday of this week.  Thankfully, there are several other Suburu dealers within an hours drive and they will get all of the future service work on my fleet of 3 Outback Limited 3.6 vehicles.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

The experience was fine.  But, the problem is still the same. We took the crosstrek in because every time we start the car the hybrid light comes on and says to restart the car.  The problem is still happening and now we have to restart the vehicle 2-3 times before the light goes off.  Do you have any suggestions?  Should we bring it in again?</Text>

Recently ordered a 2019 sti from the Sherman oaks dealer. Took my car for service at Ontario Subaru for simple oil change and my car comes back SMELLING like BURNT CLUTCH. I was very disappointed. My car has 12000 miles on it way over breakin and it smells like clutch.

For two days it smelled this way. It scares me to trust any service there.

Don’t take you car there if it’s manual. Either that or he took it on a hot ride because the lot smelled like burnt clutch</Text>

I drove from Boise to look at a car that I had been sent pictures of from the dealer. However, I was mistakenly sent pictures of the wrong car.
The sales person apologized and compensated me for my fuel and time.
Great people to deal with and not scam artists you usually deal with at a car dealership. U<//text>

<review>I took my WRX in with a very specific issue I needed the service department to address. Since they couldn't "replicate" the issue they instead blamed me saying the issue was caused by driver error...implying I don't know how to drive stick. It was a bit insulting, considering I've been driving stick for 16 years/5 cars and have never once had this issue. (I've never even had to have a clutch replaced, so in no way do I abuse or wear out my clutch with poor driving.)

I'll give their service department one more chance to fix the issue (since, surprise...it's still happening) before I go straight to Subaru of America.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<Review>I was disappointed to find this dealer was not so different from others I have dealt with over the years.  I found a staff that was not so in-tune with their customers and not all that interested in providing customer service.  I had found a Technical Service Bulletin online that pertained to an issue on my new Impreza and made an appointment to have some new software installed to resolve the problems.  Only after I showed them a printed copy of the TSB and confirmed my appointment with them, did they proceed to take my car in for service.  The software update was completed quickly and they did wash my car before releasing it to me, but the quality of the initial service was mediocre at best.<//Review><Time>1517851221937</Time><rating>3<//rating>< UserId.>

Constantly treated like we are stupid here, I've owned 6 subarus and I've been a mechanic for 15 years and when I say there is a problem with my car I'm not making things up. This is the worst experience I've had with any dealer new or used. Our next car will definitely not be from this dealer. We are also in contact with corporate over this. I suggest that if you need a new Subaru go to San Bernardino or Riverside.< /text>

The purchase of my new Subaru was a delightful experience.  I searched for my new car on-line using the AARP website.  Amber from Subaru of Ontario contacted me.  She had the exact car I was searching for.  She was great to work with; firendly, professional & knowledgeable.  And the whole buying process was very good.<//Review>

<Text>I cannot explain how much I hate this dealership. I came in with full intent to buy a car in the next two weeks because I had a $12,000 coming my way from a previous settlement I just won that I was going to use as a down payment. The salesman DANNY approached me and after explaining my situation, he REFUSED to show me a car, he REFUSED to get the key so I could turn the car on(NOT TEST DRIVE) just to look at the dash when it was lit up, and then he blatantly lied to me saying “well all of the key porters are off today.” Are you freaking kidding me? THEN he said “why would I show you a car if you’re not making a decision today? Why don’t you come back in two weeks when you get your check and then I’ll show you the car.” I was freaking livid. I have never been treated like that by any salesman I’ve ever come across. Guess what Danny in sales, I went to Penske Honda across the street and threw $10,000 CASH down on a brand new 2018 Accord Touring and then I threw the salesman over there $200 on the side for being so awesome during my car buying experience. Go see Manny at Penske Honda, he’ll show you a car anytime any day. You’re freaking rude Daniel and I hope you get fired. STAY AWAY FROM DANIEL</Text><GmapID>0x80c34aa17f442b8f:0x4a0508565192b8a9< /GmapID><user_name>Houston Monticone</user_name>< userid>

After we did the process of the vehicle and I was approved, gave my down payment and took the car. Get a call a week later saying that I needed to bring the car back because it needed some work done to it as far as warranty. Needless to know it was so they can keep the car because after a week had gone by the bank supposedly did not want to finance me!!! Complete joke!!!</text>< Pics>

Once we arrived and looked around for about five minutes Rocky one of the sales associates approached us and asked what we were looking for. Which was a 2018 Crosstrek with all the bells and whistles, he then directed us to the inventory and saw " the one," that caught my girlfriend's eye. Need less to say started the paperwork and drove off in our new Crosstrek. Thank You Rocky, Daniel, and Aaron ! ! !< /text>< Pictures>

<review>The Subaru of Ontario Team and our Internet Sales Manager Vince provided an outstanding purchase experience.  Contact and pricing was through the internet with conformation and questions answered over the phone.  No new "story" or games when we arrived for the test drive and started the purchase process.  Every dealer has additional stuff to sell- it's a business and they have to keep the lights on and meet payroll.  The difference here is that offered add-ons were announced with price tags and value benefits clearly stated- not belabored.  We made a longer drive to give them a try and it was worth it.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Third or fourth time here and it is easily the worst experience yet. Tried asking one question via phone and by chat 5 days ago, in which I left three voice mails on two different machines, and I never got a response. Went in today for the oil change and I had to wait 20 minutes just to check the car in, and when I asked why a simple oil change would take an estimated hour the service rep gave me an attitude. They clearly have no modern triage system, as they take cars first come first serve despite some cars taking hours and other jobs taking minutes. I then went in to the service manager to express my frustration and dissatisfaction, and he could not have seemed less interested. I got a generic "we are trying" response with no specific promise to improve my next experience or make up for today. As this happened I caught the service tech sitting in my car with the front passenger window down during the pouring rain (I had to go out and tell him to close the window.) Would not recommend Subaru of Ontario, I'll be taking my business the extra 10 minute drive to Subaru of Riverside.</Review>

While I was very appreciative of the swift attention to my vehicles particular issue, a damaged "steering gear". I was less than satisfied when I collected the vehicle. The system had not been properly bled, causing the steering wheel to constantly vibrate. This condition remained for approximately the first 5 miles, until the system ultimately came up to temperature and then all was calm and quiet. I have not had any further occurrence, however if it had been my wife or daughter collecting the vehicle, they likely wouldn't have been able to drive with any confidence. The car should have been road tested to be certain all was functioning appropriately prior to release of the vehicle.

Our sales men, Enrique was friendly and professional.
He asked what we features we wanted and showed us the car.
We then went for a test drive and he showed us and explaned all the
features on the car.  After wards he went through the process
of priceing the car with Francisco Perez.  We agreed on the price
and left with a new car.  We had a great experience.
The next day we returned to have Francisco show us how to use
the features in the car. He was clear on his explanation and patiently
anwsered all our questions.
If your trying to decide on a Dealership, this is the one you should see.< /text>

<review>My family and I walked around the lot for 45 minutes and don't even get a "hello" from a single salesman. I've never been to a dealership where, even though we walked by several, never even got a greeting from a single employee. We went to San Bernardino and we're treated bad as well. Finally ended up buying our Outback from John Hine (awesome experience).< /review>< Time>

<name>Nick Barge</name><review>I am dropping my review from 5 stars, down to one. Once the car was sold to me, the service department began to SERIOUSLY drop the ball. at 3,000 miles, my brand new Impreza had a low oil light. No one cared. At 6,000 miles, the low light came on, again, and I was told "The car was probably under filled from the manufacture, low oil is normal." Being naive and thinking hey, I just bought one of the highest rated cars from a brand known to take care of the owners, I let it go. at 9,000 miles, the low oil light came on AGAIN. The dealer finally began an oil consumption analysis and discovered the car was 1.4 quarts low, scolded me for checking the oil myself (they mark the oil dipstick with RTV to see if you have checked it) DESPITE living 30 miles away. If the car would have been out of oil and I would have driven it in, I'm sure they would have made me out of pocket the cost of an engine.  at 12,000 miles, the low oil lamp came back on predictably. I checked the oil... and took the car in. I was then told that the car wasn't consuming out of limits, as the service rep insisted there is only 10 ounces in a quart. After telling him no there is more than 10 ounces in a quart, They admitted it failed topped off the oil and told me to come back once the light came on again... instead of doing something about it... on the 4th reported instance of this happening... I was out of time and exhausted so I went home, stewed on it over night, and returned the car the next day insisting that I get the new engine that the paperwork they gave me says I was entitled to and that I get comped a rental. They did finally say ok, we will put you in a rental and replace the engine. I wish it ended at that.

After about a week in the rental, of which the car its self I have no complaints about, I was rear ended in a hit and run. Obviously no fault of the dealer in any way, life happens. Rear bumper was crunched up and muffler was dented pretty bad. I inform the dealer and my insurance, that all goes over well, until I request a new loaner, as I am making payments to drive a new car, and if I was hit in my personal vehicle I'd be placed in a similar new and un damaged rental to drive until the repairs are done, I reasonably expected one. No response. I called for several days and left a lot of voicemails with the service manager. no response. I mean, not a deal breaker, especially seeing as at this point I thought it might only be a few more days until I got my car back.

Nope.

It took 36 days to replace the engine on my Subaru. I was told "It'll be done by friday!" THREE times. Then it took over 2 hours to receive my car once they told me it was done, and I even waited until the next day! I arrived to a car that hadn't been washed and was rushed to sign paperwork before I even SAW the car. So they hurry up, wash it, I insist on at least giving the car a once over and at the surface it all looks ok, finally. THEN I waited another 45 minutes for the car porter to get off break, I couldn't even get my stuff out of the loaner as he TOOK THE KEYS BEFORE HE LEFT. Once he got back he was constantly rushing me and telling me how much work he had to do. If he would have SIMPLY LEFT THE KEYS I WOULD HAVE ALREADY MOVED EVERYTHING!

I drive the car home, all seems fine and happy. FINALLY, I have the car back and it hopefully won't have any more issues.

Then a week later the blower motor starts chirping at any fan speed, and the car begins bucking when under load in first gear, which as anyone else who lives in the San Bernardino Mtns and drives a stick shift will tell you... you spend a lot of time climbing hills in first gear. At this point, I'm loaded with work and don't have time to stop and waste 3 hours. So I called. Every day. For over a week. Leave a voice mail with either service or the service manager, with NO response. At one point I heard the phone get picked up then promptly disconnected.

This is hands down the WORST customer service I have ever experienced, and I would advise anyone to go to LITERALLY ANY OTHER subaru dealer in SoCal.<//review>< pictures>

I recently took my car in to get service for a transmission issue and recall issue. The techs were very friendly. They were able to examine my car with no appt and in a timely manner. I was lucky enough to have my transmission on my 8 yr. old subaru outback covered. They took care of some light bulb issues which I had not known about, as well as suggest another issue that was wrong which I had been delaying to fix. Great Service for this delearship. I will be continuing to bring my subaru here. My Fiance' and I are actually in the market to buy a new Imprezza for her next month. The tech explained very well what was wrong with my car and took the time to make sure I knew.<//text>

<text>OH my goodness!!! Words can not describe how my wife is so much in LOVE with her Crosstrek!!! From the first visit with Daniel T. Showed us what we were looking for, went for a test drive, and choosed to purchase a Crosstrek. My wife is very pickey!! It's all about the color of the car she drives. I am all about the safety!! We striked it rich by waiting for the blue Crosstrek to get to Ontario!! Couple of weeks, but VERY well worth it. Now she has her cake and can eat it too!!! My wife goes out to the garage every night and says " Good night Ms. Sexy!"  Happy Wife = Happy Life!!! I'm HAPPY!! Thank you!!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< user>

I lost 41 minutes or more as other customers were checked in ahead of me. I did not get out of there until after noon! What a waste of my time!

I sent him a client and it was like they were doing me a favor, Doug from internet just brushes you off if hes not making a lot of money from you so watch for that. I gave them a second chance and brought them a second client, Doug took an eternity to give us a deal. We drove 1.5 hours to the dealership to find out the numbers were a mistake and not doable. Doug shrugged his shoulders and said "whooops! It is what it is"?.. Definitely a rookie in the business, Doug seems to  need more coaching on customer satisfaction and training on the Sales process. The size of this dealership makes it obvious why they HAVE to make a big profit and why their focus is how much they can rip you off rather than making a deal. I will never bring clients here again or recommend them to anyone. Unless you're trying to pay 2k over sticker price. Worse case scenario ask for Aaron he was better educated and experienced but instead think of a different location maybe towards Los Angeles since they sell in bigger volume.< /text>

This is the third time I have dealt with Cheryl Sauer and Ontario Subaru, and I have had the easy handling of car purchases over the many car buys I've made in the last 20 years.  I was treated well and   , I believe, honestly.  I would highly recommend Cheryl Sauer for any Subaru purchase.  In addition, I've had my Subarus serviced at a number of Subaru dealerships the last few years, and I prefer this service department over the others...and apparently, everyone else does too.  The service department seems to be constantly backed up, though I have high confidence in the service department's work.</text>

Well it finally happened. I had heard rumors of Subaru dealerships requiring credit applications BEFORE test driving and this is one of those dealerships. I honestly could accept the credit application requirement for test driving an STi,  but they also required an application for the WRX! Absolutely ridiculous.

I came in today to do my research ahead of the termination of my current lease, which expires in March. I have several cars on the list and have worked my way through almost all of them. Every salesman I have met has been courteous and very understanding of my research. Today I was met with hostility for the first time ever. I have driven Alfa Romeo, VW, BMW, Audi, Honda, Dodge, Ford, Mercedes-Benz and none of them cared. Half of them didn't even require a drivers license to be turned over before the test drive. I gladly turned over any personal information they needed, except for SSN, and was very open with them.

I have never been asked to provide a credit application before driving a car until today. The salesman did not introduce himself, did not ask my name or my partners name. He had no knowledge of his inventory. We walked around looking at stickers to figure out which was a base model WRX. Finally we found one. The right color, right basic options (I'm a no frills guy, not cheap) and a manual. I'm ready for a test drive. After 30 minutes of jerking around I get hit with the credit application bull. We tested the back seat space and left. I am so dejected.

I will go to Carmax to test drive both the STi and WRX where they are happy to have people come in. And if I like them over my current front runners, I will probably buy from them. Their bumper to bumper warranty is better anyways.< /text>

<Text>Do not bother wasting your time coming here to turn in your vehicle, service ladies wonderful, sales and lease return on the other hand, garbage!  Drove all the way down here from Ft. Irwin(2.5 hours) after speaking with the sales rep the day prior only to be told in person to make an appt?  Great customer care Subaru! Minus the service staff, this place is not worth the time and energy and it's diassapointing especially being a ten year Subaru owner. Never again.

My experience with Subaru of Ontario started off well but ended badly. Hopefully this review can save you some trouble if you're considering a purchase from this dealer.

I sent an online inquiry from one of the car pricing websites and received a response from an internet salesperson at the dealership. We corresponded about pricing and options and she informed me she had two cars in stock, one black and one dark gray. The following is the actual email I sent to her confirming the quote (I've blocked out the pricing):

"Also, just so I understand, the quote would be as follows: Legacy 2.5i Premium PZEV = $xxx, Eyesight + Blind Spot Detection & Rear Cross Traffic Alert = $xxx, Leather Seating = $xxx, Total = $xxx."

The following is the actual email response she sent back to me (I've blocked out the pricing):

"The price you suggested below is correct according to the email quotes that are sent out. The only thing that it does not include which I always mention to my customers is the destination charge of $xxx. So it would be $xxx for the vehicle itself + $xxx for destination = $xxx + $xxx Eyesight, Blind Spot, Rear Traffic+ $xxx for leather = $xxx before taxes and fees."

I told her I was happy with the quote and that I'd take the black car. When I showed up to the dealer, the car they had waiting for me had navigation, moon roof, something called rear bumper applique, and a few other options that I wasn't told about, didn't ask for, didn't want, and increased the price significantly. When I pointed it out, they told me I misunderstood the quote. So I pulled up the email chain above. Then they tried to offer me a different car in a different color that I didn't want. When I refused that...surprise, surprise...the sales manager came out. We went around and around and he finally came to the point where he just flat out told me the quote was a mistake and he wouldn't honor it. He was rude and unapologetic about it as well.

Do I think this was really a "mistake"? I have no way of knowing for sure, but I did a google search on "car dealer bait and switch" and thought I was reading a recap. I've drawn my own conclusion; you can draw yours.

I wish I could direct you to Honest and Ethical Car Dealer X, but I can't. What I can do is save you a trip. If you live in LA and are considering making a trip to this dealer because they offered you a straight-forward, hassle-free quote--what you actually get may turn out to be neither of those things. Stay closer to home. You'll probably still have to deal with shady sales tactics, but at least you won't be subjecting yourself to a few extra hours in traffic to do so.</review>

<review>I had a wonderful experience working with Vince & Aaaron of the internet sales team this past weekend.   I received a quote via email and was able to hold the car until I could get to the dealership.  When I arrived car was exactly as discussed (I have had past experiences with other dealerships on misquotes or quotes on nonexistent cars) So having everything go as discussed made the process so easy...no haggling and the team showed the utmost respect the entire time.    The team even said they would continue to hold the car up for 3 days to allow us time to make our decision and think things over.  It only took us a day and we were back to process all paperwork.  Aaron even came in on his day off to help us finalize!
Overall, really great experience and that comes from someone who hates car buying!!!  We are very excited about our new cross trek an would definitely go back to this dealership.  We actually will also be driving 45 mins out of our way to return for the oil changes and check ups!!!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1515447821430, 'text': "Meagan Edmond, it's experiences like yours that really keep us motivated!

<review>Sincerely cannot express how easy & surprisingly enjoyable it was to purchase a car from Subaru of Ontario. Our internet sales manager, Brittainie Burner, was the leading reason why. I farmed out emails to approximately 15 dealerships from the Desert to San Diego. We were looking for not only the best deals but just an overall great buying experience. She came through & performed head & shoulders above the rest. She was particularly impressive with her level of detail & the fact that she actually addressed all of our questions and concerns throughout the process. I'm easily discouraged by the transactional nature that a buying experience can bring. After a few back & forths w/ her, I genuinely felt like she was a friend working in a dealership & I felt like we were in good hands. Another huge factor was that she was very patient. We never felt rushed, instead we got very detailed, to the point responses all within a very timely manner (we took our time and much of our buying process was conducted through email as it was important to us that we understood every aspect of buying a new car & didn't want to be nor feel rushed, thus making a poor buying decision). There were times I needed to be assured that she was truly going to bat for us, there were times some tough questions needed to be addressed, she was the consummate professional from beginning to close. We wanted someone we can trust, we wanted someone that would go to bat for us as if she was working on behalf of a friend, doing the actual work, we wanted attentiveness, we wanted someone that was knowledgeable & we wanted someone we'd be happy to give our business to....Brittanie came through for us on all fronts. ****we did all the closing paperwork w/ their finance specialist Michael. I was originally nervous that being passed off to another person to complete the process would fall short of what we've experienced up to that point but can happily say he was equally as professionally & seemingly a genuine good person, where we felt like we made the best decision we could make given such a daunting process of buying a new car. Highly Recommended....2018 Subaru Crosstrek Limited</review>< resp>

<text>My 12 year old WRX has been a great car and I’ve never had an urge to replace it. My wife needed a new vehicle and Subaru was at the top of the list. We went to Carmax to be disappointed by their Subie selection and the quality of the vehicles. We decided to check out Subaru of Ontario even though I avoid car dealerships like the plague because aggressive sales people drive me nuts. Jeremy Fan asked us if we needed help. “Oh boy, here we go” I thought to myself. I explained that we were just spending our Saturday browsing. He asked if we needed help and I told him “no”. He asked that I let him know if I needed anything and he left it at that. I was stunned that he was intuitive and knew not to be aggressive. We took our time and walked the lot. Came around to a warm smile from him and nothing more. I looked at my wife, she gave me the nod; I asked him if we could drive a beautifully equipped 2015 Forester. He abliged promptly and before you know it we’re the happy owners of Subaru#2. It was the first car we noticed on the lot and it’s the one we came back to in the end. It was THE car for our family. The whole process went so peacefully that I didn’t even think to haggle with them over the price. I knew what I saw at Carmax and I knew what I was looking at here and there was no comparison. Same price, way way different experience and much nicer and better equipped and better condition vehicle. No comparison whatsoever. Got it for 2k under KBB value without any hassle. I appreciate you guys, you changed my whole outlook on car buying. Thank you Jeremy for this great experience.<//text>< Pictures>

My wife recently purchased a new 2018 Subaru Impreza with five miles on it. It was all fine until we were told that we needed to bring in a cashiers check for 15,000 and when we got there we were told it was 15,000.59. So we had to pay the 59 cents or no deal really. Ok fine we let it slide but then we were driving home and heard a rattle coming from the dash. So we called and set up an appointment for that and our fog lights to be installed. The fog lights were installed fine, but they said they couldn’t find the rattle. Then a few days later the radio resets over and over. The Bluetooth won’t connect and all the radio stations reset to the manufacturer settings. We notice the headlight indicator no longer working and had set up an appointment to replace the instrument cluster. Comes to find out, this car model doesn’t come with that and none of the mechanics knew... they had to go look at other models to see if they had the same light.  When bringing it back we heard a squeak on the outside of the door and rattle on the inside of the door. So we bring it in they look at it but they don’t have the right mechanic on sight even  though Paul Haley set up the appointment himself. This trip was absolutely pointeless, having no appointment for me wouldn’t be so bad but I live an hour plus away. I call my salesman Marc who is more concerned with getting a 10 on his review then helping me. I call him to talk to him about my concern and his response is, he may send me another survey to do so if I could please give him all tens it would help him with his bonuses. So we go back for yet another appointment; they look at it and say they will fix the issues. So I go in to pick up the car and while driving away, the fuse box door falls on my foot so I go right back to the dealer after dropping off a hertz rental car to have them fix it. This is when we notice the steering cover isn’t attached, the center console has a pin hole in it, the steering cover looks as if sand paper was taken to it, scratches on the inside of the speedometer plastic, a huge gap in the speedometer plastic, a gap in the dash frame at the door, the dented trim near the radio from them removing it, the heater clicks every time you turn it on, and a screwdriver was wedged in my driver’s seat. They argue with me over it then state they will fix all the damages they have caused and I said fine I’ll make yet again, another appointment. I called corporate  to tell them what’s going on and Kyle says he will call Paul.  Then I get an appointment with Paul Haley to go over all the problems and now damages done to the car. Paul is driving in the test drive and admits to hearing all the rattles. He writes two pages of notes on the damage then proceeds to tell me I’m better off trying to get a replacement vehicle because they will never be able to find the rattle in the dash and my car will never be the same again....ok great. I tell this to Kyle at corporate who says he will contact Paul. A week goes by no hurry, right? Kyle calls and states that all he knows about is the radio and door rattle he knows nothing about the damage to my car. Paul never sent the 2 pages of damage info so either Kyle or Paul is lying to me and my wife. I call Paul and he now says that he will need to have someone look at the damages (the damages that he already knows about! Then, why would you have looked at it for an hour?) So now I get a email not even a call from corporate stating they will not replace my car and nothing can be done till I take it back in. It also has now developed a rattle in the engine when starting. So now I have to go back in for my 7th appointment in three months. I put over 700 miles on my car specifically going to the dealership for repairs (not to mention the gas and time off work it has cost me). I have sent corporate numerous photos of the damages done and still, this is the result. I just want my car fixed and to be done with this ripoff company. UPDATE I had to get an attorney.</text>

<Review>This review is for my internet car-buying experience (so far; note that I'm waiting for the delivery and I have not yet been to their physical location).

I used their "contact us" form on the website to request a quote for a built-to-spec 2018 Crosstrek (I'd already test-driven the car and knew which options I wanted). Vince Sperling responded quickly with a competitive quote for the exact build I requested, no nonsense about "you should come in" or "we can't give out quotes online" or "how about this sorta similar vehicle we have on the lot" or "please call so we can work out the details". He followed up the email with a quick friendly call to make sure I had his quote and it was for what I wanted. I later got a slightly better quote, but Vince matched it. Eventually, based on his quote and the great experience I'd had interacting with Vince, I've decided to go through with the purchase with Vince and Subaru of Ontario over a similar quote from a different dealership.

Note that I contacted 14 LA area Subaru dealerships for this purchase. Most of them were pretty bad - quite a few were awful. Getting quotes was like pulling teeth. So Vince's help here, getting me the quote I asked for, being responsive, not pressuring me into something I don't want, being honest and straight-forward -- as "customer service 101" as that sounds, it really is exceptional in this business.

The car is expected to be delivered in October, and I'm anticipating the rest of this purchase will go smoothly, with the same no-nonsense no-hassle no-pressure experience I've had so far. I look forward to picking up my new Crosstrek. :)< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Just an FYI, I telephoned in the middle of the day on a Monday, (Mar. 3, 2014) with a question about a vehicle I saw online. After 7 rings, the call was answered, which was no big deal. The woman transfered me to another location, (since the car I was asking about was used), and I got no answer at all there ~ just an answering machine asking me to leave my name and number. LOL ~ if it's that hard to reach someone when I want to BUY a car, I shudder to think what will happen if I had already handed my money over to them! Sorry, they may be nice people, but hopefully this review will spark them to reexamine their customer service approach.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

<text>Sales department: Friendly, no pressure toward purchase, one month later i am ready for a new forester, had to wait like one week because they didn't had any 2.5i touring in stock.  They have the best price toward new car. 5STARS
Detail department: They had my car wash, but problem is the guys they hire to do the detailing, use dirty towels and put scratches all over the exterior paint, I see swirls everytime i get into my new car. 1STAR.
I would give them 5 stars, but their detail guys are terrable!!!<//text>< pictures>

<rating>1</rating><text>My actual car-buying experience was very smooth and easy. Then I drove away in my new Legacy and immediately the StarLink system which the salesman had kindly linked to my phone for me began to malfunction. It beeped continuously, so I turned around and went back to the dealership. My salesman wasn't able to be found, so they contacted Michelle who was very sweet and was perplexed as to what was happening. The system kept beeping and wouldn't let us unpair the device or even change the volume. After 20 minutes, we finally were able to unpair the device and she told me to "drop in" at the service department on Tuesday. I did and was told that the salespeople do this "all the time" and they don't take drop ins.  He said he would need the vehicle for at least 3 days to work on this as they don't have StarLink devices in stock. I live 2 hours away, and was not offered a loaner vehicle or a ride back home. My StarLink works about half the time, but will randomly change screens, beep incessantly, suddenly change volume, or start "loading" when there's nothing to load. I never know what to expect every time I turn the key.< /text>< Pics>

I called Subaru of Ontario on June 24, 2017 at approximately 7:30 am & had the privilege of speaking with Ashley Pedvin, Service Advisor for Subaru of Ontario. I shared that my wife & I were on vacation & I had some issues with my 2012 Subaru.  Her voice indicated she had a genuine concern for my situation.  Even though I had made an appointment on live chat the night before for Saturday June 25th at 7:30 am (no appt's available for Friday morning) she told me to bring it in & the techs would take a look at it.  We brought the Forester in & I had the privilege to meet Ashly, she was as genuine in person as on the phone.  She was able to get me in and the technician (Jerry Lopez) found the problem quickly, made the repair, ran diagnostics, topped off our fluids, & performed a safety check and we were on the road again in less than an hour.  Ashley was so compassionate & kind, she is definitely a keeper, & if I were her supervisor I'd give her a raise to keep her.  Ashley you were a blessing to us and you made our experience a joy!<//text>

< Review>
Had a memorable experience with Subaru of Ontario. Zhang Haiqian was easy to work with and made me feel important. I use to be a VW owner, but over the last year, I encountered multiple disappointments with their service and customer experience. VW did not make me feel like a valued customer. However, Subaru did which is why I am now a loyal Subaru owner. I will recommend Subaru to my friends and family!</Review>

<Text>After shopping around and getting horrible quotes. I finally found Subaru of Ontario and was quoted $500 less then all other Subaru dealships. Amber Arias was a life saver and gave me a huge discount on my 2017 Subaru Impreza. I custom ordered my Impreza and got the exact features and upgrades I wanted, without having to pay for the ones I didnt. I love my new Impreza and thanks to Subaru of Ontario I got it for an excellent price.<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>Made 3 internet inquires and 6 phone calls last week to set up an appointment to come down to buy a Forrester. We knew package and color we wanted and already had finance approval. Just needed to negotiate payments. It has been 7 days and still no call or email. The same said for San Bernardino Subaru, nothing from them either. Must be a company practice.. Well I bought from another manufacture about an hour ago .. too bad we were your easiest sale ever..< /Text><user>116029027522727146158</user></record></dataset><record>
<text>The service on my Subaru was taken care of within an hour and I have no complaints with how either myself or my vehicle were treated.

I have chosen to give four rather than five stars because I witnessed some rather unprofessional behavior while I was there.  Two different employees, on a couple of occasions within my hour visit, sat (rested their behind on the hood/bumper) on the hood of an unsold STi.

I don't believe that they caused any real damage to the vehicle, although any contact with a painted surface that is not spotless or otherwise lubricated with some sort of cleaner/soapy water can cause swirl marks (fine scratches in the clear coat).

The real issue for me is that this kind of behavior symbolizes a certain lack of respect for what will eventually be a very significant piece of property for someone else.  The kind of person who buys an STi likely loves cars and driving, and wouldn't like the idea that their vehicle was sat on by anyone.

I realize that we aren't talking about a Ferrari or a Cadillac here, but as I said earlier, it simply seemed disrespectful to me.

Ultimately if the staff think that sitting on what is soon to be someone else's property is acceptable, I have to wonder what else they believe is within the realm of good behavior.

This may or may not bother you, but as someone who is very passionate about cars, I felt compelled to share with others who may also share my concern.<//text><user_name>Nick Culver< /user_name><user_id>102583415314885238659< /user_id><pictures>None<//pictures>< rating>

While the required recall services were quick, I was very disappointed that the service tech took no measures to clean up afterwards, or keep clean my Forester's interior. Fingerprints were left on the glove box and dash surrounding the glove box, and a big shoe print was left on the floor mat indicating they used no paper floor protectors as most service depts do. In addition, the work also required disconnecting the battery. In doing so all my AM-FM radio station presets were wiped out. Usually where techs have to disconnect the customer's car battery, they write down the station presets before so doing then reset them as a courtesy after the work is completed. The tech also didn't reset the clock to proper time. None of these are costly or damaging faux pas, but they are very annoying — It's no fun getting onto the freeway after leaving the dealership only to find you can't tune to your favorite stations. Trying to do so while on the road is dangerous. S.O.O. needs to go the extra mile to show they care for their customers and their customer's car. As I have noted, this is standard service courtesy with most service shops. My Firestone store does this for my vehicles each and every time I go in for service.<//text>

<text>I brought in my 2016 subaru wrx cvt because it was having problems during a cold start. When I was trying to get on the freeway the RPMs would smoothly go to 3000 then suddenly jump to 6000 and redline. I recommended a factory reset on the CPU and so far that seemed to fix the problem. My only complaint with the visit would be the shoe scuff marks on the side skirt of the driver side door. The clear coat is scuffed up and now I have to get it professionally detailed to get the scuff marks out.  This seems to always be a problem when I get my car serviced since it's not the first time it has happened.< /text><response>{'time': 1482775625181, 'text': 'Hi Christopher, we appreciate you providing us with this feedback so that we can improve and make sure that scuff markings do not happen again.

Bought an Outback. Brittanie Burner from Subaru Ontario was the best. Used my GEICO app to contact several dealers. Brittanie was one of the responses I got. I liked Brittanie from the get go. My gut said straight forward and honest. That she was knowledgeable and efficient was a bonus. Got a great deal.< /review>

Terrible customer service, no one ever answers the phone and have had the phone hung up on me several times or if not they leave you on hold for a long time then eventually hang up. Very bad communication in service  dept. They will make appointment for you and then when you get there they say they gave to reschedule due to being short staffed.</Text>

<Date>1490042945753</Date><Review>Last week I took in my subaru in for its first oil change and let me tell you about my horrible experience. I took my car in the morning. I was greeted by the ladies at the front desk of the service dept they were very polite. They told me I would have to wait about an hour. No problem. After the wait I get my bill and the maintenance report and I pay my bill & leave. I first notice that my car wasnt wash even though like the two people before me to pick up their car were told that they had washed their car as little added bonus. Its one of those things kind irks you but whatever not really a biggie unless something worst happens and something worst did happen.

After that I go home run some errands & attend to some business, I pretty much end up driving around the whole day. At 6pm on my way back home my car check engine light comes on and the low oil light also comes on and my car start to smelling. I pull over open my hood to see what is going on and thst is when all this smoke comes out of it and my engine is covered in oil.I check and where the oil filter is its sitting in a pool of oil and that where the oil is coming from. The mechanic at this dealer did not properly tighten the oil filter and that is where all of the oil from my car was coming out from. I called this dealer immediately to let them know what happened luckly the lady who helped me in the morning was still there. I told her what had happened & she told to drive it in. I asked her if they could tow it in she said no she did tell me that I can call for a tow but I would have to pay for it. I asked for the subaru road side assistance number and she gave it to me and then she told me she was leaving for the day but to just leave my car at the dealer and she would leave instructions with her team as to what happen. I asked how would I get around and they said that they would have everything ready for me when I got there. Well I had to wait 2 hours for the tow truck to come pick me up. In those 2 hour my cars battery died. Pretty cool guy actually. We got the the dealer and nothing was ready. No one had a clue what I was doing there until the cashier remembered that someone mentioned that someone was dropping off a car for service the next day. I asked about getting a loaner because this is my main mode of transportation and I was told that I was suppose to have a ride already after that her and an older gentleman that works there were talking about just giving me a loner said something about needing an RO & "just deal with it tomorrow."

I asked the lady that was helping me out about a refund, "she said that she would not be able to do that." I was asked for my insurance card so I had to go to my car to get my documentation. I ended up having to help the tow truck driver out with unloading my car because we asked the car maintenance crew that was there for help because the battery was dead. They just told us no because it was their problem. I get having an attitude if your the best of the best at what you do or your part of a team that is the best of the best but when someone has to return a car the same day it was just serviced because the owner can not use itbecause you and your team could not do a simple oil change properly You dont have a right to an attitude. I had to sit in the car with my foot on the break because the tow truck driver had to look for a way to secure the car he found some long pieces of wood to stick under the tires so it wouldn't roll away because they couldn't be botherex to help us with it. After all that I finally get back inside to deal with the loaner & I leave the next day they told me called me to come & pickup my car that everything was fine. I asked them if they had replaced the engine they said no that they did a visual inspection and road test and everything is fine and that they replaced the battery. I picked up my car and I have been driving it for a while now and I have noticed issues especially with the car especially in traffic and acceleration some times when I have to stop and go. So extremely bad service< /Review>< Name>

<Text>After I had looked previously at another Subaru Dealership and was unimpressed by the sales staff. I went into the dealership after inquiring online about the 2016 Crosstrek.  I met with Brittanie Burner and she was AWESOME! She was the ONLY Subaru sales person at any dealership that told me that I could order my car from Japan EXACTLY how I wanted it. She told me it takes a few months to get here but I didn't mind. She made buying my new car so easy and I was so happy that I have already referred friends to her. I LOVE my 2016 Crosstrek! Thank you so so much Brittanie!!!!<//Text>< Pictures>

It is all your decision that go to this dealer or other dealers. Also i am not saying this is good or bad for you guys. Because if you are okay with this number you may not care about it.

I went the ontario subaru to buy a 2016 STi base.
They charged me $47,000 OTD for 2016 base STi. But i paid $38,500 OTD at another dealer.

I do not know that it is okay to mention the name of dealer which i purchased my STi.

It is one in near Azusa ave.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80c34aa17f442b8f:0x4a0508565192b8a9<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

To top it off.  when I went out of my way again to return when asked to.  CHUCK sales manager look at it for 2 mins and siad ok call me tomorrow to see what we can do.  When I called CHUCK back he said sorry nothing we can do,  his eact words were "it is what it is"  this car is sold as is.  He would not give me his supervisiors number nor the number to corperate.

<Rate>5</Rate><review>I called Ontario Subaru after having a very bad and aggressive encounter at another SoCal Subaru dealer.  I spoke with Amber on the phone and was quickly quoted fair out the door prices (with no haggle) on an Impreza hatchback, with all the different options I was  considering.  After the test drive she arranged a dealer transfer to track down and find the exact model, color, and details I was looking for.  It was completely a no-pressure purchase.  Even with the service packages and the other items that are always offered with a car.  She gave us the information and then left my husband and I to deliberate what worked best for us.  I had the feeling throgh the whole buying process that she wanted to only sell us what was valuable in our eyes and not to try to upsell us.

Absolutely the best car-buying experience I have ever had. I highly reccomend Subaru of Ontario as long as Amber is working there.</review>< pictures>

<review>Passenger window stopped working so i took in my WRX, was helped by Crystal, she helped me avoid having to leave the car,taking a shuttle, and then coming back by staying after hours and going above and beyond to get my window fixed on the spot, FREE OF COST. Crystal a real one and deserves a raise!<//review>< pictures>

The woman in charge of HR (Mary Ellen Russel) has to be the RUDEST woman I have ever spoken to! Immediately started screaming at me and then hung up! HOW RUDE!! I'm not sure how they conduct business but if their business office is any indicator I would steer clear of this place!<//Text>

I had a scheduled appointment time for just an oil change. I arrived before the appointment time.  It took an hour and fifty-five minutes past the scheduled appointment time to complete the oil change. No explanation was given as to the length of service time nor any apologies as to the lengthy wait time.< /Review>

So i recently Purchase a New car at this dealership due to their lower sticker prices now, don't get me wrong i don't regret buying Subaru,but the Customer Service here stinks  I made an offer 11,000 down as cash(almost paid for half the car) and people here were not really wanting to negotiate,they added on Security fees almost $1,000 worth (watch for those). I'm a a first time buyer on my own felt like no one was helping, what pisses me off the most is that they kept pushing extended warranty until finally i got it understanding it was hassle free cancellation it has been less then a month trying to cancel going back week after week they keep giving me the run around talking to Javier Finance Manager there and he said call the bank that holds your loan. I did that they told me in their exact words go to dealership and they should cancel.  When i went in Javier told me it hasn't processed? which is B.S. next time i went in he kept brushing me off making me feel stupid saying there is nothing we can do until its processed also he said if i cancel my interest would go up because they "help me out by lowering it 0.6%" and that if i canceled it they would raise it up by what was original % so are they making their own numbers or what?! So I called next day to actual service department i asked them a specific question giving account number for extended warranty and asked has it processed they said yes, which then i was furious because it's been processed the whole time but they didn't want to help me cancel because they lose money on it, so now because of this they lose my customer loyalty along with anyone else i encounter i will be sending else where!!! Chuck ain't to much of a friendly guy either i gave him an offer up front and he said "I'm in the business of making money not loosing it"  So now I am going directly through and mailing a letter like told over the phone to the Subaru extended warranty department to cancel like, come on who has time to write letters now a days! Never again DO NOT BUY EXTENDED WARRANTY ON NEW SUBARU CAR!</Text>

I had an appointment at 8:30 AM for an oil change and tire rotation. My vehicle wasn't done until 10:00 AM. Normally that's not a big deal, but with an appointment? I don't believe that's acceptable.< /review>

Poor management and customer service. My wife and I walked in and didn't receive a greeting until we had passed at least two members of management. Find another dealership....especially if you're a minority. Management doesn't deal with minorities.</Review>

Went to a few different dealerships to find an SUV as a new car. Put an online inquiry and Ernie reached out the next day. He was more than helpful answering all the questions via text, test drove a similar car (because the Ascent was not in), we loved it so much that we put a deposit down on the 2021 Ascent. Ernie stayed in touch every few days to make sure we knew when the car was going to be delivered. When Ernie texted us the car came in, we had to make a late appointment to pick up the car. Ernie stayed and assisted the entire process.

Anyone looking for a new Subaru, call Ernie.< /Text>

<text>I bought a Crosstrek from Ernnie Chan and this was the best car buying experience I have ever had. He was very knowledgeable and I never felt pressured. He just wanted to help me!
