This is their main distribution center, and they can answer all your FedEx questions. I had a package delivered to my home, addressed to someone I didn’t know. I went to a different FedEx and the package kept getting returned to my house. Then, I went here, and they were able to figure out the mystery behind the package, and made me feel better to return the package to its rightful owner.

For any purchases you must bring a government issued ID to complete the transaction. It’s a new rule in place, so just don’t leave your ID in the car or at home.

They have all the packing supplies you need to send off a package. Plenty of space out front for parking. The space is clean, if no one is there when you walk in, just wait and you’ll be helped.<//text>

FedEx has been very reliable for my purposes but the woman working on 10/29 at the desk closest to the managers name plaque was not trustworthy. Not only was my package not delivered on 10/28 by 8pm as promised but she also was phishing for too much personal information from me. My package had gift cards for my customers. Not only was I already concerned about her holding on to the gift cards but now I also have to worry about her possibly trying to steal my identity. I hope they send her for more training or she at least shows some initiative to learn about her customers before she treats them that way.</text>

It's been years since I used FedEx for shipping. I usually ship via USPS, but wanted to ensure my packages got to their destinations promptly. I received excellent service at the counter and greatly appreciate the time spent with me to ensure that I send my packages in the most efficient and cost effective manner. Kudos to FedEx employees at this location!<//text>

<text>Their drivers are the absolute worst. If this center is responsible for delivering your package and it needs a signature, don't expect them to deliver it. They will lie and say they attempted to deliver your package multiple days in a row without ever stopping by or leaving a door tag.

< Review>
I dropped a package at this location on Monday, March 23.
They had only one person working and a long line so I just left the package with other prepaid packages.
My package was stolen by employees  and never showed up in the system as shipped. They have camera and record that I dropped the item but no one ever bother  to help me. Filing missing package report was a joke and did not produce any results.</Review>

I am at home but they didn't knock so I loss an important mailing, bad service. Now I had to go here to track my package. The mail man, could you please knock the door when deliver package? I feel mad when I didn't get the package even if I am sitting home whole day waiting for that.

<Text>Delivery card said that parcel would be available for pickup after 4pm. I commuted 45 minutes to get to this location, only to be told that I need to come back after 6pm. I waited 2 hours until 6:30pm, when finally the worker said she'd check on my package but requires proof of address in addition to my passport. I showed her my RENTAL LEASE on my phone, and she said "We don't take nothing electronic." Are we in the stone age? Who even gets paper bills these days? Do you really think that paper bills can't faked?

<text>They broke my 65 inch TV and then when I filed a claim they said it wasn’t it the right box. No one at the store told me it was an incorrect box after I told them multiple times it was a TV. They offered no type of coverage, not even a refund on shipping, nothing. What is the point of a shipping company if they just break your things. I could’ve dragged it behind my car for less.</text><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

This location only specializes in FedEx domestic and international shipments, hence the name, FedEx Ship Center.

Lines can get long if you drop by during lunch or close to the domestic and international shipment cut off times. Easy parking. I prefer this location to the FedEx Print and Ship Center on Maxella if I'm only doing shipping.

They've done away with the paper airway bills so the clerks have to enter names and addresses manually on the spot -- I don't have a FedEx account so I can't enter in the info via the website, but next time I go, I'm going to bring a typed list of address info so I don't have to dictate from/to infos regarding my shipments.<//Text>

Came in at 7:30 on a Friday. The location is clean and the gentleman who helped me greets me when I walked in and promptly got my package. Good customer service, lots of parking, hassle-free. No complaints here!<//Review>

Terrible service. The manager needs to staff this location more appropriately. I waited 40 minutes just to be told that they would not be able to process the request because the "system was down." Wasted my entire lunch break, please be more aware of customer's needs when working in the customer service industry.</Review>

Amazon shipped an order with Fedex and this location is handling the delivery. They said they attempted delivery on Friday, but couldn’t access the building. I’m pretty sure that’s a lie since EVERY single other delivery service has access to our building. UPS, USPS, OnTrack, even Amazon themselves has access. You’re telling me that Fedex is the only service in LA that doesn’t have the universal code for our building?? Stupid.</review>

I went in saturday morning at 8 Am and Rick was at the main counter.  He was so rude to me and wouldn't answer any of my queries.  He was busy shipping out packages and when he finished with these few packages he started sweeping the floor!

I have never been so dismissed by an employee anywhere as this.  If I were his employer, FEDEX I would pay him NOT to show up for work.

Needless to say I would NEVER set foot in that place again.  I wonder if they screen their employees..............< /Text>

<review>i had an issue with a package that was sent to my daughters address and returned to the M D R office undeliverable. I went to the office to pick it up. It was complicated and unfortunately i was losing my temper. Employee Diana Townsend is an exemplary employee and deserves huge kudos for her professional and kind service.She not only helped me she helped me with friendly and professional service. Thank you Diana, with my humble apology, T. Goldenberg<//review>< pictures>

First..they  have no reception to do wifi..you go there and they can't download your document. U have to go back home and send it. Problem is they don't tell you.  They act like it is unexpected when it is a constant problem.  Second..time I came.. pleasant Braziliangirl decided  to stop waiting on me in the middle of my transaction and wait on a girl her age (w a baby) who just walked up.   ..it took 7, 8 minutes b4 she returned to me.   At first I thought she must have been waiting on her before me,  but no.  I filled out my 2nd  envelope and she just  took someone else.  Perhaps my elder age .. Made her feel i didn't matter.  Outrageous. If I were a young man I would not be treated so boldly rude. . Bummed me out.  Manager did nothing of course.  But..Helpful Gusys the 1st time I came....(  tho they should have told me on the phone there was no wifi reception.) so I give 2 stars< /review>

Their Fedex driver tried to deliver 3 times on 4/14, 4/15 and 4/16. They left 3 door tags with 3 different door tag numbers. So when I went to the Fedex ship center on 4/18 with the latest door tag,  they said they couldn't find it. I called customer service later and they finally located it, but they said I can't get it anymore because it's being shipped back to the sender. It has only been 4 days since the first delivery attempt. I asked if they can hold it for one more day so I can go pick it up the next day. The answer was no. I found the whole thing a huge waste of time and I would try to avoid using Fedex in the future.<//review>

NIGHT AND DAY difference to Happy Nails on campus, this place is 1000% the better choice. My nail tech was gentle and did an amazing job and my manicure cost less (!) here. Very pleased and would return again.< /text>

<text>Everyone was very kind for my visit! I stopped  in the day before to get an idea about cost and they weren’t pushy like other places to get me in a chair. I came back the next day to get my nails done and they were great! They lasted forever too! I can’t wait to go back!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<text>It’s in a nice place , has a good receptionist. They have verity  of very good colors. My specialist would show she knows very well,
I did not like my nail work, when the nails grow, it will not look natural, which is the biggest negative point of her work. She charged $ 60 but even could not figure out what nail shape is best for the fingers.<//text>< Rate>

Had great colors and sanitizing following Covid procedures but my acrylics were not up to the standard I expected. I got a full set of gel acrylics in a coffin shape and they fell off after 6 days. The shape was uneven as well as the acrylic was uneven. You could also see the clear part of the unpainted acrylic when looking at the nails in a Birdseye view. Not only that but they took a little longer than 2 hours to get done. My mother had a great experience there just getting a regular manicure so maybe acrylics just isn’t their specialty. I have had much better experiences at other nail salons and I personally won’t be returning.</text>

I went here to get my nails done before our cruise. I also got a pedicure with a design on my toes. Both girls were excellent. The leg massage wasn't spectacular but the nail design was really good and only $5 for both toes. Nails lasted the whole trip even without gel so I was happy. I have recently went to a different salon because I'm new to Irvine and wanted to try another place, but wasn't as pleased even tho they were cheaper. This place is worth the cost. Just make sure you have an appointment they were very busy.<//Review>

My wife went there a few times and always gave them a second chance! But definitely she won’t go back there anymore! Their customer service is 0 star! No matter if you have an appointment, you have to wait 15-30 minutes! Then they change their nail stylist in the middle of the work, because their schedule is messy! Their nail work can be also done dirty and not satisfying because they don’t pay attention and don’t care about the customer!!!!

Last time she made an appointment and she went there 5 minutes late, and they canceled her appointment, because she was a few minutes late, while you have to wait a long time before they check you in most of the times due to their terrible scheduling!

Not Recommended AT ALL!!!</Review>

<text>Best nail salon in Irvine area yet!  I've been getting my nails done for decades so have been to my fair share of salons in and outside the area.  This spot is extremely clean, nice ambiance inside, quality nail technicians and reasonable prices.< /text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80dcdf95bb25f8a5:0xb1c6e3714adb4652< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Amazing service.  As a business owner myself, I appreciate the cleanliness but also the customer service.  They offer champagne, sparkling water, water and goodies!    If you get a chance, ask for the VIP room.  And I love the Chanel retro chic modern look they have!   😍.

And ask for Nancy!  She’s amazing and a sweetheart!  She did a great job and I’ll for sure be seeing her again!</review>< Time>

<Text>Really bad gel manicure experience. I had Vicky do my nails. She left a lot of dead skin on my nails and she didn’t even use cuticle oil she just poked at my skin with her tools. I just have gel on my nails, no decent manicure was done. Very disappointed, won’t be coming back here!< /Text>< Pics>

Very bad experience. Stressful and unprofessional. The lady that was working on my nail was watching TV while working on my nail And had headphone and listening to music at the same time and was filing my nail very aggressive and harsh . Bad customer service, old instruments. Stay away.</Text>

Nails have always turned out great, BUT if you’re like me and enjoy whatever massage time your procedure comes with, you might be disappointed. I just felt the emphasis on the massage was very weak and could use improvement.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Impeccable reception service. I did not like the manicure. The girl was not having a good day. Perfect pedicure. For the rest I liked it. I will be back

(Original)
Atención de recepción impecable. La manicura no me gustó. La chica no tenía un buen día. Pedicura perfecta. Por el resto me gustó. Volveré</Text>

What a fantastic class! I highly recommend that you check out their studio. It’s incredibly clean, but more importantly, your work-out will be intense. I guarantee your body will get into fantastic shape if you start taking their classes. I’m eager to attend regularly in hopes to get bikini ready!!<//Text>

<text>Amazing class, the instructors are great! I had a blast coming back from doing Ballet back in childhood, this Barre class gave me so many good flashbacks. I loved how all my muscles were involved. Great toning class.
Also, a nice little studio, clean and neat.
thank you.< /text>< Pictures>

It was my first time doing barre and I loved it! Marina went out of the way to modify for me due to my bad knees and wrist, and gave each person individual attention to improve their form. The facilities were pristine. I will definitely be coming back. Thanks Pure Barre!</review>

< Review>
after years of not taking any kind of workout or dance class i decided to give barre a try! i started with the first week free trail, and even though i have gone 4 days straight. I am so excited for my 5th class! the teachers are so friendly and have made me feel very comfortable to keep coming back. i cant wait to continue with classes!</Review>

<rating>5<//rating><review>I've been going to Pure Barre in Redondo for almost a year and a half now and I couldn't be happier with my experience! The pure barre work-out is the only type  of fitness that WORKS for me (I dropped 15 lbs in the first three months) and I also enjoy it! The instructors do an incredible job of mixing up the classes and the music so that it continues to challenge and I never get bored. I have the type of body that bulks up from lifting weights, but PB has increased my strength while leaning out my muscles (I went from a 10 to a 6). The staff is super fun and helpful, and I really just can't say enough good stuff about PB Redondo.</review></record></dataset><record>

I went to my first class at PB and immediately left there sore in all the places I've been struggling to tone up. Since that first class I go just 3x's a week and feel stronger and more fit! Classes are always changing and the instructors are so encouraging! A really fun environment!</Review><Response>None< /Response>< Pics>

Edited 7/31/2019: The new Reform (Pilates-based) classes are amazing and super challenging. The amazing instructors at this location keep me coming back.
---I love the "new" Pure Barre! The workouts are constantly evolving to incorporate more cardio and ballet/dance-style moves. The new "Empower" classes are intense! The instructors at Redondo Beach are so sweet and friendly - and amazingly fit - really take good care of their clients! Love this place!!!< /review>

Best workout in the Southbay, fun and challenging, great music and if you want more cardio, try platform classes. Classic classes , a low impact class that works each muscle group and in no time you will feel stronger. Teachers are the best , music is fun and everyday you’ll feel grateful that you were there!< /Text>

<time>1522290497781</time><Name>Sasha D< /Name><text>This is one of the nicest fitness studios in the Southbay and I should know because I’ve done a Groupon to pretty much all of them.  I’ve been going for three months and I seem to never plateau because the workouts are always a little different and always challenging, and  being a music snob, I must say the music is really good...It’s hip, driving, and  pumps you up  👌👌👌  Barre hub  could use a playlist like their’s because their music was outdated and sped up so fast that it sounded like chipmunks were singing...Sorry BH,  your playlist was a huge turn off.

Loved our time here! The beer is so good and such a great atmosphere. Love the food trucks! Definitely worth a visit. If not becoming a regular. Do they have a trivia or live music night? If so, I am so here</Review>

<Review>Great fresh mix of hazy's, ipa's, stouts, and saisons brewed up with care. Nice, tucked in an industrial environment taproom on the edge of Oxnard and Camarillo. Nice and friendly appreciative and attentive crew. If your in town and need some quality beers (of course you do).. stop in and grab some to go! Hopefully soon they'll be able to at least reopen their patio to consume on-site!!😁🍻< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYNpNXzw5PDjimwDx4vVpOtn_cTq9IFRl7-hf7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPc15QRGQfTnCKRN31gXUmY_J_xGBTOycPLHqOE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

I randomly found this place and I'm glad I did!!! If you're fond of sour beers, then you have found your heaven. I got a flight of four different types of sour beer and each one was completely different from the next.  The staff was friendly and explained what a sour beer is made from and how they make their beers.

It's located in an industrial setting, so it can be hard to find. Google Maps will put you right there, though.

They have barrels aging their beer, kind of like a rick house, and it's a fun place to relax.

Go try one for yourself.</review><response>None< /response></record>

Great beer, but none of the 3 food servers who work here wear masks. This is dangerous and illegal. A purchase of food is mandatory here, so they should figure this out.<//review>

First time in. A bit pricey on the take away options. Will have to sit in next time to try their taps. Easy enough to find, and even with COVID limitations, the place seems nice.</text>

SOUR ALERT! Located in a super industrial spot.  It almost seemed like we were in the wrong spot... but then again most good breweries are located in these random areas.
They don’t do tasters, but they do half pours.  On a scale of 1 to 10 on the Frambues, I’d say it’s an 8! 👌🏻
Definitely check them out.</Text>

It's interesting to see how places are navigating social distancing! I enjoyed the rice beer I had and Smokin Jay's was so bomb!<//text>

Great brewery specializing in sour beers, saison, and NEIPA. Cool vibe. Cool place to hang out when it's hot outside. Easy parking in an industrial park. Food trucks sometimes.<//Review>

<rating>1</rating><Review>This was my first time here and I can’t say that I was impressed. My partner and I accidentally walked into the wrong door. And while one employee greeted us super friendly, the other gave us the dirtiest look. I assume they were having a conversation and we interrupted. We decided to try it out anyways and sad to say the beers weren’t that impressive either. Both of the beers that we ordered were flat and I felt like we were being rushed into ordering. The decor and atmosphere were cool I did like how the place looked but unfortunately it seemed like we were bothering them.  To be quite honest they aren’t even deserving of the one star I just gave them. Wish the experience could’ve been better</Review>< Pictures>

<review>We come here about once a month. They always have great beers for any taste bud (sours, IPA's, stouts) and super friendly service. Highly recommend picking up cans if there's any available when you go - we've not had a single one we were disappointed with. I think their Hazy IPA's are comparable to Monkish and the drive to Oxnard is always less trafficy :)</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1581964105298, 'text': 'Thank you for your kind words.'}<//resp>< gmapID>

As a lover of sour ales, I just had to visit Casa Agría ('Sour House' in Spanish) once I heard of it. They did not disappoint. Their great selection of sours (farmhouse, saison) and one IPA, stood up to our tests. I heard that they're expanding into a neighboring space and plan on adding other types of beers, as well as food, to their menu.</review>

Not family friendly. I was really looking forward to spending the afternoon here. Our family drove 45 minutes to get to the brewery on Father's day only to be told at the door that no children were allowed. We've been to plenty of breweries and this is the first time I've seen one where children are not welcome. We turned around and drove home, but decided to stop and check out Institution on the way. Glad we did, the place had a great atmosphere that wasn't hurt at all by kids sitting at the tables. Afraid I can't comment on Casa Agria's beer since I didn't get the chance to try any.<//Review>

I'm glad we searched for "ventura sours" and found this place! The beers were great, and the bartender was friendly and nice to chat with. The brewery is strangely placed in the middle of a business park, and not very obvious with the signage, but worth the slow drive through the parking lot. We wish it were closer; we'd come more often!<//Text>

Tucked away in an industrial area between Oxnard & Camarillo is where you can find the BEST sour beers in the 805!! Marcus & all of the Staff are very friendly & knowledgeable!
Take home a bottle or two, trust me, you will get the hankerin' for it when you get home. The artwork on the labels are always on point as well.
Really nice vibe here with colorful artwork on display and there is usually a food truck available in the evening. Free comedy nights are an awsome way to spend your Manic Monday's.
Casa Agria is where it's at!!!!</text>

Great place to visit, especially if you're into sours and wild ales. Huge selection, which also includes a few solid IPAs and stouts. Friendly staff who can offer good recommendations. Very unassuming and no signage from the street so don't miss it!</Text>

The place has potential however it seems like the staff either doesn't care or is too uptight. Their air conditioning didnt work so it was stuffy and humid. They charged me for an extra beer after one of the workers opened a second tab for me. Another worker put the charge on my first tab and said he was going to void the second tab but never did, so now I have to call back to get it fixed over an $8 Beer (not happy). The beer is fine, but the staff is very unprofessional.</review>

Tried three sours. Their base, don't remember it's name, and 2 la. Llornya, a peach sour built on the base. I love a good sour and I wasnt disappointed. I wish I was a local instead of a visitor.<//Text>

Excellent offerings and currently the only brewers to supply a selection of lambics and sours here in Ventura County. They seem to specialize in sours (and good for them) but have also produced really nice Vermont style IPAs. Seek these guys out.< /Review>

<Review>Remember when you first tried Lambic and thought, wow, this stuff is amazing? Well, you can get sour ales—for that is what Lambic is—close by. Eric and the genius brewers behind their Casa Agria (Spanish for "house sour") in Oxnard have crafted a most amazing assortment of sour ales to delight and tantalize your palate (for the record, the ales I tried have not been sweet). Try the salty one (La Llorona)—don't worry—it's only mildly salty. Or Mega Citronic—hoppy, citrusy, complex. Listening to Eric talk about his brews is like listening to a composer talk about his symphony: “We collected the wild yeast in an organic field and then . . . we aged it for four months in a bourbon cask, then switched it to a port cask and finished it off with . . . " I don't remember the details, but I was spellbound listening—these guys are off-the-chain serious about extreme creativity when it comes to brewmanship, changing and responding to what’s in season and imagineering exotic new tastes. But mostly, it's the ale. It's always about the ale. Just sip and think and enjoy. Casa Agria will be YUUGE someday, you can feel it. Now it's tiny, so go quickly and try—while you can still talk to Nick and company and get a dose of sour-mania first-hand.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

Good selection of products and food, went to buy some chicks, had a good selection,  but adult chickens were missing all kinds of feathers,  not sure if it was mites, didn't want to take the chance on bringing something to my chickens at home,</Review>

<Text>This is a very cute little spot. They have tons of cute stuff in the store. It is small but it's definitely worth to stop by to just look at all the stuff they have. On top of animal supplies they sell alot of cute decorative items and very cute pots for plants.<//Text>< Rate>

parking isn’t great (have fun leaving the parking lot)
All of the chickens have their tail feathers plucked out
They have large rabbits inside and sometimes guinea pigs and hamsters
The rest is feed and tack
Prices aren’t cheap but aren’t super expensive
The chickens are all out in the back and they only ever have silkie chicks that don’t look that good
The store itself is kept in good condition but it is a bit small< /Review>

<review>This place is the real deal. Charming, friendly. Not only feed for your pets and farm, but unique gifts, outdoor/garden items, family owned. New businesses try to create this kind of historic charm, but Malibu Feed Bin has it. My son and I stumbled upon it on our West Coast trip from Virginia. Aside from a friendly mom and daughter who served us, there were live animals: chickens, turkeys, lizards, chinchillas, guinea pigs, birds. Go see!<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

< Review>
On october 20th, I got two pet guinea pigs. At first it was an obsession and I thought that it would never happen. My mother has pet chickens so we would go there for chicken food and various other chicken products. Seeing guinea pigs there every time crushed me knowing I would never be able to get them. When a circumstance arose that I could finally get guinea pigs, I freaked out. I thought I would have to go somewhere else to get actual guinea pig products and that they just had guinea pigs there, but they have the whole nine yards! Not to mention the fact that everybody there is super helpful  and sold us just the right products  to keep even the pickiest of pigs happy. Two months later I now have what I believe to be the happiest guinea pigs in the world thanks to Malibu feed bin and they're amazing selection a various pet products and pets themselves!</Review>

<text>Great experience with this rental agency I hadn't really heard of before. Best price that I found for the area and accurate listings, which seemed to be a problem with other rental agencies around here. Great car and super smooth rental experience and drop off at the airport. Had to share to reward my great experience here when I was pretty stressed about finding a rental.< /text><user>112712914960321064703< /user><Pics>None</Pics><Time>1614462399651< /Time>< Gmap_id>

My sister and I had to take a last minute trip to LA that we had nothing planned. Upon arriving to LA we were able to reserve a car at this location thru the app an hour before pickup, which was super convenient. This was one of the few car rentals in the area of our hotel. Layton was a joy to work with, he gave us an amazing deal on a Range Rover HSE and was super personable and friendly! He was quick, efficient and thorough throughout the pickup process,  he made our last minute trip to LA a lot easier. Would highly recommend visiting Layton at Sixt in West Hollywood if you’re visiting LA!</review>

I booked a reservation in January 2021 for June 2021. I was picking up at Studio City and dropping off at another location. Since booking, Studio City location closed. I was forced to re-book at West Hollywood and was told my original rate would not be honored. My new rate was more than double what I was quoted at Studio City.  I went back and forth via email with representative from SIXT and nothing was resolved. It was very difficult to get anyone on the phone. Everytime I called, I would get disconnected or told that they could not honor my original rate. It was not my fault that their location closed. Any reputable company would have honored my original rate. I have since cancelled my reservation after a month of trying to make contact with SIXT corporate managers. I was able to get a much more reasonable rate with a competator. I am very disappointed with this company.</Text>

<text>Arrived about 15 min. early.  I was greeted warmly by SIXT representatives Dustin and Dean. Great conversation ensued while I was being serviced.  Dustin took the time to thoroughly explain all of my  options and immediately address my one concern.  Dean went the extra mile and gave the car a thorough wipe down before I left.  This's is the level of customer service that you expect when you patronize local businesses.  Very satisfied and will return . Thanks Guys<//text>< Pictures>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Rate>5</Rate><Review>Had a great experience here! Recently rented a car to get out of town for a few days and the national online site was easy to use and Sixt offers a nice selection of cars. When I arrived the day of my rental, the staff was very helpful and helped me with an upgrade for a very reasonable cost. Upon returning a few days later, car return was quick, staff was again very helpful, and was on my way home in a matter of minutes.

Worth noting, this particular branch in West Hollywood is currently inhabiting a very small lot, so it can be a bit hectic and hard to get in and out of if you arrive in another car and multiple rentals are happening simultaneously. That said, I was told they are expanding to the space under construction next door and that should help with their space and inventory management a lot!</Review>< name>

<Rating>3</Rating><Text>They are mostly nice in this agency but they are not very keen on upgrading you even if you pay regular monthly price for several months. To be fair they upgraded me once but it was mostly because I had to return the car they gave me as it was really filthy. Also, the last 2 times I returned the car they tried to pin damage on me (I am still dealing with the 2nd claim) that I never ever did as I am very cautious. So be very careful when renting with Sixt.<//Text>< gmap_id>

<Text>I'm typically a long term renter and rented for the first time with sixt from March - Nov. 2020 in The greater Los Angeles area. I had a jeep i was very happy with. Unfortunately when I asked to purchase it, the local branch was unable to help and referred me to "sales" phone number.

The sales department was not interested or knowledgeable on how to sell me the vehicle. Didnt offer solutions. I asked the phone rep for the Germany HQ info and the rep didn't know it. I got the feeling they didn't care to try to sell or at the least extend my current long term rental with a comparable rate considering I want to extend for all of 2021 and eventually buy it from them. No knowledgeable person available to make this transaction happen.

I had my contract update 2 x during my 2020 rental. Both times they took zero consideration to try and keep me as a customer in a fair rate. My rate double 2 x during this time period! It went from 400 (start of covid) a month to ending at 1400 a month (oct). So much for customer retention.

Furthermore,  there is a bad disconnection from their Germany HQ with there local reps at the stores and on the phone.
I would have kept renting from them but why bother? They don't really care to keep you renting. At least that is the impression I got.
I guess it's back to hertz for me. Such a shame. Lost a loyal customer who rents a lot for business and pleasure.</Text><GmapID>0x80c2bed0b381840b:0xcc1726084500ea10<//GmapID><Resp>None</Resp>< rating>

<Rate>3<//Rate><text>You know, this rental joint is pretty good. It's hard to articulate why I don't give them more stars.

There  is just a general sense of malaise, which I feel I share with the employees of this place. And I am not criticising them.

I've written many reviews and I try to be specific. In this case, it's difficult.

My best guess is that there is some trickle down problem that derives from a corporate mismanagement issue.

I like renting nice cars, and this company advertises this is their specialty. However, they just seem to never actually have them. And there seems to be no interest to accommodate the needs of their customers.

Maybe this is the issue. Its false advertising maybe. They seem to present themselves as a premium service, but they just aren't.

I wouldn't feel this way at Enterprise or Budget, or whatever. I would expect nothing.

At this place, I expect something more because they present themselves in marketing as offering something more.

But they simply don't.

There it is.<//text>< GmapID>

<Review>The worst customer service ever! Never have cars in stock, though will tell you they do on the phone. Impossible to speak to corporate. Turned in the car early and was double charged. So disorganized. They will even rent you a car with oil light on and tell you to "you can just put oil in it". Not my responsibility.</Review>< gmapID>

<date>1598883580158</date><Rating>1<//Rating><Text>I will never rent from this company again!  I prepaid for a rental to pick up a car at DFW as I was traveling from LAX to visit family on August 4th.  On July 20th the country went into a second lock down and the word was not to travel unless you had to. Also many states had mandatory quarantine and businesses were closed.  I made the right decision to cancel my trip on July 26th.  I cancel my flight in American Airlines and was given a refund. I canceled my car rental through my app and was still charged since I had prepaid the rental.  I called my credit company American Express and disputed the charges.  Sixt sent me an emails requesting I still pay for the rental. I emailed them back explaining the situation why I canceled.  In the meantime I prepaid for a local rental but when I showed up at the counter I was not able to rent because accounting apparently had blocked me from renting however I had prepaid this rental two weeks earlier an had gotten emails asking if I wanted to ad extras to my rental.  Not was did I receive an email about not being able to rent.  I manager apologized and said they would refund this rental however that did not happen a charge still showed up on my statement and I have disputed those charges as well. I’m sure another email will soon arrive requesting payment for a service I never got.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<UserId.>103127226838074847490< /UserId.>< Review>
This was my third rental through Sixt. The reason it was my third consecutive rental was that the prices are good and I never had a problem with them.  Until this third time. I had paid at least one month in advance and indicated I wanted a Mercedes class vehicle - or similar. I understand "or similar". The first time I rented, I also said I wanted a Mercedes (which they did not have when I went to pick up) and they instead gave me a Land Rover. THAT is "or similar".
When I picked this vehicle up it was not a Mercedes SUV - or similar. It was a Cadillac SUV.  I am NOT the only one who thinks a Cadillac is NOT in the same category as a Mercedes.  The attendant stated that "We rarely have a Mercedes available. We classify the Cadillac as in the same category as Mercedes". With nothing else available, according to the attendant, and my vacation ticking away,  I took the Cadillac.
The vehicle had not been cleaned. Specifically, the passenger seat had debris in the seams; there were white dusty marks on the glove box; the touch screen had fingerprints all over it (especially disturbing during Covid 19) and the exterior had black specs on it which the attendant said not to worry about, that this "had already been noted" as damage to the vehicle. These black specs subsequently washed off!!
When I returned the car, I told the very same attendant how dirty the vehicle was when I picked it up and my concern about it not having been properly cleaned which surely meant it had not been sanitized against the corona virus. The attendant told me that they sprayed the vehicles with a sanitizer; and then he assured me he would speak to whomever cleans vehicles upon return.
Oh, come on, Sixt!!  You just told me the procedure is to spray a vehicle with sanitizer BEFORE (or IN LIEU OF) cleaning it???
I would think that with business probably just beginning to pick up for you, that you would make certain every customer is a happy customer. The attendant should have offered me options when I stated that I was not pleased with the Cadillac SUV. AND YOU SHOULD HAVE MADE CERTAIN THE VEHICLE WAS PROPERLY SANITIZED.
No excuse for this.
EDIT ADD ON 2 DAYS LATER  -
My friend left his phone in the vehicle and didn't realize it until after we had returned the car.  He drove back to the drop off location and was told that the cleaning people hadn't found his phone and the vehicle was already rented and gone. He kept calling the phone periodically and later that day the current renter answered and affirmed he'd found the phone under the seat.  Another great cleaning job, Sixt.<//Review>

Hands down the best rental agency out there. My 1st experience with Sixt was renting a car in Brussels so I was ecstatic when I got home to see that they're also in the USA. I rented from the West Hollywood location several times now & have had an excellent experience each time. The staff is extremely helpful & friendly. The prices are very reasonable & the car selection is top notch. I'll never rent from anywhere else.

Keep up the great job !!!!!</review>

Thank you for the fantastic service! The Sixt rental office in West Hollywood is everything you can ask for - the staff is super professional and very service minded. You can tell how much they enjoy their work, and to make the customer the priority, they helped solve an issue that came up with my reservation, and I have only positive things to say about this office. Thank you!! I'll be back soon!</text>

Worst car rental experience ever. I made a booking online and stop by to pick that up but they tried to tell me that they don’t have any car available and funny part is I’m looking outside there were so many car were parked and one guy kept on bring the one after another car after wash.
I usually go to Enterprise but this Sixt location was closer for me to pick up and drop off but didn’t realize that their employee is there to con you.
Now he kept on telling me it was their system fault of taking this reservation and wanted me to pay twice the price for different car and saying that’s the best price for a that I don’t even want. On top he tried to tell me that he had to ask permission from his GM to give me that price.
So I’m looking at their site on my phone to check the price it was way cheaper than the car I booked and what he quoted me. I showed that to him and he said it was a glitch and it’s not gonna let me book that price.
So I wasted my time, money and energy because of their faulty system if I believe their employees story. They didn’t even try to help me or accommodate me with something similar. I guess customers need aren’t that important for them. Scamming and jacking up price for their profit that’s their moto.
He kept on acting like renting me a car like doing a favor to me so I declined his favor and got an Uber made a booking at Enterprise went there picked up my rental pretty smooth an easy.
So be very careful if you go there for you next rental from their tricks of charging you more than you supposed to.<//review>

I rented a car here to visit family, and when a shelter-in-place order came into effect due to Covid19 a Sixt representative instructed me that I could return my car to the local Sixt office at no charge so that I wouldn't put myself or others at risk. Except, they DID charge a one-way fee 4x the original price and then tried to dispute that a representative never told me this. Such unethical money-grabbing when so many are struggling financially. If you want to be treated with respect and consideration, look elsewhere.</text>

<text>Reserved car online and paid in full. When I got to the location they informed me that an additional $500 deposit was required on the same cc used when reserving the car. No where does it inform customers that a deposit is necessary when reserving a car and paying in full. Additionally, they would not take cash or my debit card as form of deposit for the car I already paid for in full..so I thought. RENTER BEWARE!! They are not flexible, lied about calling their district manager for assistance and from personal experience avoid at all costs. Or experience frustration like I did when renting from this shady, not up front with hidden deposits, company.< /text>< Rating>

I called customer service before my pickup time so that the branch would know to hold on to my car until I could pick it up the following morning. This never happened. when I got to the branch that next morning my car was not available and I had no other choice but to pay an extra large sum for a more premium vehicle. while I recognize there was nothing that the branch employee could do to help it is not acceptable that she was not aware of my situation when I came in that morning.</review>

Changing my tune.. it took a minute but this company went outta their way to help me out after I was mislead on their pre-paid policy. Not only that but they always upgrade for free and their vehicles are always quality<//review>

Great Service!

Considering their computer systems had gone down all morning, staff were cool, calm and provided a very good service. I would recommend and return without hesitation.<//Text>

Sixt is a total shakedown operation.  When I picked up my car, the location was chaotic.  The cars were parked very close together with no chance to really inspect.  The agent at the location never left her seat and never inspected the car.  I am absolutely certain that I did no damage to the car.  When I turned it in, they claimed I damaged the left front bumper.  They did nothing at the time, but checked me out and billed my credit card for the agreed amount in the rental agreement.  Then, several weeks lated, I received a bill for damage of $417.08.  I wrote back and told them it was bogus, but they pressed forward and threatened a collection agency.  I then searched the company and found out they do this all the time.  A total scam that tripled the amount of the rental.  I will never rent from them again.</review>

This is the only car rental service I rent from, in any city I can find them. Their locations are usually super convenient (the one in West Hollywood is right down the road from my last three apartments and the one I use in Miami is super convenient as well) and their selection is better than other places. Sixt definitely seems to consistently have the best prices and their service is always on point, especially at the WeHo location. They’re super friendly, helpful and timely. Renting from there again in a couple weeks and I’ll stay loyal to this location, as well as Sixt in general, for as long as they continue to treat me like Gold. It truly is a great experience every time.< /review>

<text>I'd recommend this branch and this company. I have had bad experiences with car rentals in the past -  but SIXT in West Hollywood was a very positive experience. I appreciated the help and professionalism and the flexibility when I needed it. There was no wait time either picking up or dropping off the vehicle and my deposit was returned in a timely fashion.< /text>< Pics>

I love this place. If you want to rent a nice car for a good price this is the place to go.  The only issue is you now need a credit card to rent a 7 passenger truck.  The staff is friendly and obliging.</Review>

<text>Unfortunately the car I reserved 1 month in advance was not available.  The only possible substitution was almost 2 times more expensive (not saying it was GMC Acadia).  Kind of blackmailing: either for unknown time or take what we give for 2x price.  I’m very unlikely to use Sixt services in future.< /text><username>Alexei Zhurba< /username><Rate>1<//Rate>< response>

<Text>Reserved a midsize car (Mini Countrymen or similar) on Expedia for $33/day at 5pm the night before for an 8am pickup. I walked to the agency 8:30am and they didn't have a car for me because I "booked last minute"... After standing around at the counter for 20 minutes was told they didn't have the car and my other option was a Chrysler 200 for $55/day. I don't know in what world a Chrysler is worth more than a mini, but the fact they wouldn't honor the price for a midsize was enough to make me leave. I called customer service later and was offered a minivan for $33/day but no midsize like I reserved and like a Chrysler 200 isn't because it's a compact C-segment car.

<text>Please do yourself  favor and rent car from somewhere else. worst experience ever in my life when I went here to pick up the car that I prepaid for it 3 weeks in advance. the Agent that was helping us was name Andrew , the worst customer service and doesn't know how to talk to customers. rudest person ever i have meet in my life. They didn't have the car we booked for and they started giving us BS about why they don't have the car, we booked a SUV and they were trying to give us a Van. asked for Manager and they said there is no manager at this location. Andrew came to us and said you can take the Van or you can go somewhere else an rent the car. non of them had name tag on and when i asked for their name, they said they don't have name!!! i got lucky to ask Andrew's name from one of the customer that was returning the car and he said don't waste your time and go somewhere else, they not going to help you man.
manager never called me back to explain what happened, even when i called several times and left my information. how they are running the business without no manager!! if i could i would give them 0 not even 1 star.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

this was probably one of the easiest transactions ive done in a long time. Unexpectedly I needed to get a rental car [at 6pm at nght] I rented the car on line and headed to the location who were open until 7pm.. They called as I was on the way to confirm the details and once I got to the location I was in and out in around 5 minutes. Cant say enough good things about this car rental location. Very happy and would definately recommend.<//review>

Fast return of van we rented. Not on the corner lot so need to be watchful to find the location.  No close by gas station so need to fill up before returning the vehicle.</text>

<review>Very good community based rental car agency. As well a major company, good community presence. Always has good specials and senior discounts. Fantastic cars, upgraded more than most other agencies and very new, not run of the mill models, in excellent condition. Great staff, very friendly  and accommodating .  Open 7 days a week. Very convenient.<//review>< pics>

<Review>Wow - what rude staff.  Renting is 50/50 with Sixth - sometimes they would accommodate, more often they would have this crazy story about how even though you reserve a certain class car, they don't really have the car in inventory, that Mercedes convertible just became a Chrystler mini-van.

Bottom line, they always try to gouge you for more money and punish you if you won't cough up. The guy started giving me the same routine today, except this time I made sure to look for other less expensive cars first.  When he started giving me the hustle, I just didn't want to hear it and said what can you give me that's the same price I agreed to pay online, and the guy just refused to honor my reservation.

This will be my last interaction with this shady company.  When I asked for the district managers name, they gave me nonsense - the name of the Enterprise district manager - as I discovered on LinkedIn.  I wonder if one of the actual Sixth exec's I found there will respond.  I doubt it though,  to treat me that way as a customer is a systemic failure far beyond a personality conflict at the store.  Avoid at all costs.< /Review><user>104592698250528725997< /user><Pics>None</Pics><time>1560826858466</time>< username>

I dont have a credit card and was willing to put it on my debit card but they refused to do that as well. They told me that I need utility Bill's under my name which I am a renter and dont have. in the app it says cash deposits are available if I dont have credit card. They refused to give me a car AND THEY ALREADY TOOK MY MONEY no refund was given because of this. horrible customer service DO NOT COME HERE I filed a claim with my debit card issuer since SiXt does not care about their customers<//review><username>Navid Mahkhatam<//username>< resp>

<Review>I asked for a Mercedes (for which they never seem to have the cars they advertise available) and some how in their minds a Cadillac is in the same impressive league (Which it is not) they sent a Cadillac in place of the for mentioned Mercedes coup, the main office sent me a car that was dented and scratched on one whole side! the front license plate looked like it was just hammered flat enough to fit the front, a total Rent-A-Wreck situation. At this point I don't know if i'd feel comfortable recommending this service, the first two times i used them it was a flawless experience! I flew in walked to the counter got my car and was out. i don't know what changed, but there are other options for high end rentals here in Los Angeles, the only reason i'm giving them 5 stars is because of the customer service of Mr. Desmond J. who was understanding and accommodating  of the situation and also surprised knowing the high standards that Sixt is known for. i'm hoping this is a one off, and something slipped thru the cracks but this type of service is very disrespectful to your customers luckily i was able to procure other means of transportation. sometimes its not about just getting from here to there sometimes its about your image when getting from here to there which is why a lot of your customers choose Sixt. thank you Mr. Desmond for making an unfortunate circumstance  pleasant and tolerable.</Review>< Time>

<Rating>4</Rating><Text>I was renting a specific car as we wanted to test drive a car my wife was interested in buying.  I appreciate getting the exact car I asked for and the staff was congenial, helpful and informative. BUT...the car wasn't ready for me at the time requested.  I was offered a replacement in order for me to drive to Beverly Hills and pick it up there.

This where I have a few issues: 1) since I had to drive to a 2nd location to get the rental, shouldn't my rental time be adjusted to the time I picked up the car I rented? 2) the car I picked up wasn't "clean" to a standard I think it should have been; a) Immediately evident: the wheels were covered with that gray brake dust, and b) although there was sticker reminding renters NOT to smoke in the car, I could see remnants of ash in the cup holders and on the dash.

Drop off was EXTREMELY easy! Again staff was very polite.< /Text>< Pictures>

Supposedly they were for other customers arriving later that week. I am still trying to contact sixt to get a refund of the 800+ dollars I spent on a rental that I never drove. They are ignoring all my emails despite me sending emails to their customer service, and no refund has been issued yet.< /text>< pictures>

Very easy and fast pickup and return. Not happy that I didn't have a choice of vehicle but happy that the vehicle I got was the best option in my category. Lot was full so there was cramped and limited space to open the boot for my luggage. Vehicle was fully loaded with all bells and whistles and was just 8 months old with 7500 miles on the clock. The price was almost half than the nearest competitor and I would definitely choose them again. Kudos Sixt!< /review>

<review>DO NOT TRUST THIS LOCATION!!! We prepaid for a vehicle that totaled $1,200. They called us and said the don’t have any vehicles in stock and they can’t assist us with rebooking at another branch. Also, the manager “was unavailable” so we couldn’t get a refund. We have called dozens of times in past 2 weeks and the manager is never “available” to process our $1,200 refund. THIS PLACE IS A SCAM THAT WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY!! Don’t book through Sixt West Hollywood unless you are prepared to lose every dollar you pay EVEN IF you never get the car. I am still waiting for my $1,200 refund from August 4th.</review>< response>

I was appalled by your service today at Sixt West Hollywood. I reserved a car weeks ago, with the understanding I would be able to pick it up without issues. However, when I arrived your employee refused to accept my card, on the logic that my card wouldn’t give the protection needed for that car type. This illogical course of action was taken on the misunderstanding that UK debit cards do not offer requisite protection for the payee, and  you lost my business.

As a result I had to go to a competitor’s location, where hiring a higher spec car ON THE SAME CARD proved to be welcome business for them. However, as I didn’t have a reservation it cost me considerably more.

As far as I’m concerned this is entirely Sixt’s fault, and I am owed compensation for the difference. A copy of this post has gone on the Google review and Facebook page.</Text>

<Text>I had the worst rental experience ever (I rent a LOT of cars), but that's not necessarily this branch's fault. They've been polite when I've been able to interact with them, but the fact is that's impossible to do without going to the branch because nobody EVER answers their phone. The calls bounce to the national center who try to call the branch and then just hang up on me. Their customer service line is absolutely useless and nothing can be resolved because you can't actually speak to someone. Use a different rental service if you can because if you have any problems which could easily be resolved at, say, Enterprise, it will be a NIGHTMARE here.

Furthermore, my friend from out of state rented from here, they never informed him they didn't have the car he reserved but they also tried to charge him for damage he pointed out to them on renting. Fortunately he recorded everything because documentation is clearly not the Sixt way.

If I could give zero stars to Sixt, I would. Because I'm reviewing the branch, consider the one star to be because as I mentioned, the branch staff are great when they are available. Which is never, basically.<//Text>< Response>

I made a reservation for a car online using my debit card, the day before I needed it, and showed up in the morning to pick up my car. I was on a tight schedule so I made sure to double check the requirements to avoid any delays. When I arrived I was told that I needed two pieces of mail to prove residence before I would be able to take the car. When I made the reservation online, all it said is that residents have to provide a valid ID, and non-residents have to provide a passport.

When I said that this information is not included in the rental process online, the clerk just replied with, "But yeah, it is."

Seriously? I checked everything on mobile AND desktop to make sure I wasn't missing anything and it wasn't there.

So now I'm out over $100 until the transfer goes through, and I'm way behind schedule.

If you want to go through Sixt, I recommend calling and triple checking their terms because obviously their online service is sub-par, which in this day in age is absolutely ridiculous.</Review>< pictures>

This was probably the worst costumer service I EVER had, and will ever have, we reserved a car about three weeks prior of our arrival at this place, and we reserved an SUV for the porpuse of having a high clearance and spacious car, first of all they did not have the car and they were lying in every way to justify the fact that they screwed up and were just coming up with excuses and “solutions” for us. They gave us all sorts of answers like: the car is in the back lot; someone picked the car up before you guys; and so on and so forth, we spend almost 3-4 hours!!!!  at this rental place and there was no manager on duty to at least try to solve our problem, instead of a manager there were these employees that started insulting us, and not being helpful, once we started asking for their names they started hiding their nametags. Getting closer to their closing time, they said that we can just go and rent from another place, we had already booked a hotel room and we were supposed to head there for our vacation to start, but no one seemed to care specially this guy named andrew.They offered us a van at the end which was not what we were looking for and ruined a good chunk of our vacation with their negligence. You might as well go buy a car and sell it after your vacation if you ever plan to rent from this place, it would be much faster and more convenient.< /Text>

When I picked up my car, they gave me an upgrade to a BMW from a Nissan. The only thing I didn't give 5 stars is that I knew nothing about any of the features on the car and had to figure them all out on my own. It would have been nice to go over them, first since it wasn't the car I was expecting.  I rented it for a week but something unexpected came up and I needed it for a few days longer. That wasn't a problem, it took about a minute on the phone. Dropping it off could not have been easier. I will probably rent from them again.</Review>

The branch told us that they gave our Mercedes SUV away to a last minute rental and that we can, for the same price, have an AMC, which is several booking classes less. They did not offer any free upgrades, since we were "late" but handed us an upgrade voucher for a future rental. Reality check - We will never make another rental with Sixt.< /text>< Rating>

<user>112809958816894152720< /user><text>Although I'm a Platinum member and rented with Sixt for over 100days in the last year,  the company JUST REFUSED to give me a car although I had a booking confirmed, they wouldn't tell me the reason and refused to do ANYTHING on their side!!! They kept repeating: we can't  do anything, call customer service, as if I had to deal with the fact that Sixt is unable to proceed a booking they confirmed with me THE DAY BEFORE. So I called customer service. However it was closed... Despite that, the desk kept telling me they couldn't do anything and now I spent 30USD in Uber for nothing, waisted over an hour in transport and argument, AND of course I'm without a car although I had a booking previously made! Sixt took ZERO responsibility for their mistake, I have NEVER EVER SEEN A company which such a low customer service and basic respect. Again, shushed from a confirmed booking with no explanation WHATSOEVER. This is unacceptable whatsoever and I will never ever rent with Sixt ever again.</text><time>1539556957009<//time>< name>

<Text>Lousy service from Sixt. I had a reservation paid in full and couldn’t pick up the car at the original time. I tried calling on 3 different occasions to change the pick up time and all three times no one answered the phone. When I showed up to pick up the vehicle they said it’s no longer available and didn’t have any other vehicle available for us at that time. I ended up going to another rental agency and because it was such short notice I had to pay four times as much. Never again will I use this company.</Text>< Resp>

Mostly easy rental besides bickering of employees re lack of air conditioning inside branch and then asking me 10x if i really wanted to decline certain coverages.  No joint walk around the vehicle. no instruction on the vehicle.  took me 10 minutes to figure out how to get out of the parking lot even tho i was blocking other rentals coming in and out.  after the rental it was not easy to just park the vehicle as the lot is too small. had to park on the sidewalk for 5 minutes. vehicle itself was more than perfect.< /text>

After charging my card in full for a two week rental, I was refused a vehicle upon my arrival due to not having the necessary documentation to finalize the rental. It seems that in contradiction to what my printed contract stated, they now additionally needed a copy of a utility bill to prove my residency in California. My official driver license from the California DMV which now has features making it virtually impossible to counterfeit, along with the card that they processed the full rental rate with, were no longer acceptable enough. I pleaded with the manager not to do this to me, that I was going to lose out on a huge job situation if I did not get my car and be on my way to the appointment I had. I told her I would even fax a copy of a utility bill later. She flat out refused. Additionally, when I called after walking out to get her, she said hold on, put me on hold and left me there a for 20 minutes before I finally hung up. Calling again sent me straight to a generic voicemail recording. I lost this job I needed so badly as a result, and have now been told to get a refund I need to request it by email.

The manager gave us another type of SUV (Kia Sorento) which worked out great for our trip up the CA coast.  Although it was not what we reserved, the manager and agent made it right and they were very nice.  Return at the SF location at Fisherman's Wharf was very easy as well.  The prices were much better than Enterprise and Hertz.  Just check with your insurance policy ahead of time to be sure you don't get talked in to paying extra for their insurance policy.

<Text>Small lot on Santa Monica Blvd but incredibly helpful staff.  The class of car I had reserved was not available, but the staff still got me out the door in a timely manner in an upgraded class.  Steffano was super! He explained everything and made sure I was happy both when I left and returned the car six days later.  The only negative was that the settings in the vehicle I received were still in Chinese (from the previous renter?) and it took me several minutes to figure out how to reprogram them into English.<//Text>< pics>

Worst car rental or non-rental experience of my life. I booked a rental 6 months in advance, wanted to rent a nice car for my wedding weekend. I confirmed, reconfirmed, and read the user agreement 2-3x, took a credit card out which would hold the maximum deposit required only to show up and have the woman say sorry you need 2 credit cards to be ran for a 2,499$ deposit each. I made sure to have 1 card, but the 2nd card I didn't have. I thought no problem, we have another card. NOPE both cards have to be in the same name. I was so frustrated. Luckily I left, went to Avis down the street and was rented the same car with only deposit required being the amount of the total rental amount. Makes no sense, policies are not clearly (OR ANYWHERE) stated, and to boot the woman I had to deal with was rude as hell and just kept rolling her eyes, like i should know I needed $5000 available for a deposit for a mid-tier bmw.

Awful awful awful.<//text>

I tried this location because it was fairly new company to me and being German, I thought it would be high in customer service. Boy was I wrong. They should change the name from Sixt to last place to rent a car.  It doesn't matter if you are platinum member or rented from them many times, your loyalty and business mean nothing to these people. They (sales people to the manager) try to charge you a higher amount and when you point out that their online pricing is actually cheaper than what they are quoting you, they give you a well-orchestrated over-booking song and dance routine. Either book early and make sure you are there early or be prepared to be extremely frustrated. I'm going to my other car rental option as they are more sensible and flexible. This location does not value good repeat customers so I will be avoiding them and you should too.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I reserved a mid size suv to pick up at 9. Seeing my guests flight delayed by two hours, I arrived at this joint at 11. I was told my mid size suv I reserved was gone. They want to charge me $20 extra per day for a smaller car, Cadillac ATS, maybe it’s an upgrade in comfortability but we had a hard time putting just two large suitcases in the trunk. They asked me to take my own Uber to their Beverly Hills location for another car. I had no extra time. I’ve been renting cars for the past 15 years and this is the first time a rental agency wants to charge me more for not holding the car I reserved. They blamed me for showing up late and not call but I had the reservation and there is my number on file, why don’t you bother to call me before giving the car I reserved to someone else?

Was going to give one star but added one more since the manager agreed to upcharge $10 Instead of 20. Manager needs to learn math better: he kept saying I was 3 hours late—my reservation had a pick up time of 9, I got there at 11, they delayed me till 11:30. It’s 2 hours 11-9; even 11:30-9=2.5, not 3

The passengers I was going to pick up landed at lax while I was trying to get this straightened out but they seemed to be in no hurry. Took me more than half an hour costing $10 extra per day to get a smaller car.

Very disappointed.

Update 8/9: my trip is ending today. One day earlier than planned. I’m downgrading my review to 1 Star since my two guests and I had a miserable driving this car around the National parks since one bid suitcase had to sit in a back seat all the way. My guests are a mother and son it’s a graduation gift that mom gives the son and they suppose to sit together. My spouse suppose to sit in the front now but couldn’t come since there was no room. This car ruined our once in a lifetime vacation. I had to squeeze this big suitcase into the backseat each time we check in and out of a hotel and now my back hurts as hell.

What a nightmare .  The response from their corporate showed no apology at all... so not holding a reservation and not calling the customer before giving away their car is their corporate policy?

I’m going to report this company to BBB. This is a dishonest company that should be shut down.< /Text>

GREAT experience at the Weho Sixt. Rented an SUV for the weekend, filled out all the info online which made the process of pickup SO easy. Like 8 mins tops. They upgraded us to a gorgeous, brand new Yukon XL with all the bells & whistles for no extra charge (which came in very handy and was quite luxurious to drive). Drop off was very quick as well, so easy, 5 mins and we were done. Highly recommend. FIlling out the driver info online beforehand is the way to go. You can just roll in and pick up your car seamlessly.  Will rent again no doubt.< /Text>

<review>Worst experience ever.
Worker doesn't have knowledges about their own policies. Especially, stupid manager is on meeting for forever. It was worst renting experience and also, wasting money too. Don't ever try to rent from this branch. Save your mood from danger :)
Ps. Do some meeting for staffs first because they don't know anything<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Really great experience at Sixt during my stay in LA! Robert was friendly and helpfull. I reserved à Ford mustang and because it was not available the day ai was supposed to get it they gave me a 2018 well equiped Mercedes C class cabriolet! You get unlimited milage on most of cars and this is great! For the rest or my stay I took a Chevrolet Malibu to get my big luggages at the airport and it was easy and great as well! Fully recommended.</text>

<date>1495652642149</date><rate>1</rate><Text>Worst experience ever. Never wrote a review until today. The manager at this location is completely clueless and only response to any situation including mine and several other unhappy customers was that he doesn't have any authority as a a manager to help in any way. The online booking is a mess, editing a reservation not only did not work making me miss my reservation (tried to move it up one day) but I also got charged the full amount due to cancelling when I was a no-show the second day when I showed up at the shop. I highly advise anyone to not use this company and location.< /Text>< Pictures>

<user_name>Almaz Amandos<//user_name><Text>I would not recomend this place. That was my second time of renting a car here. I reserved a car on their website, but once I get there they say that I'm not eligible to rent since I have only a debit card not credit. What?!! They say I either have to have a credit card or bills from my house given on my name or plane ticket with the date of departure. What?!! I'm international student, I study here, I share the rental of the apertment with my roommate. That's why bills come on his name every month.
And the most important thing is that last time they gave me the car when I rented it and there were no problems with it. Now they say that it was one time exception. Whaaaaat?!!
I had to cancel all my plans because of them. I'm very disappointed and would not recomend this place!< /Text>< GmapID>

Disappointed and not satisfied, we booked  for 14 days the star category. It should have been a mustang convertible or camaro convertible. At the day of the car pick up we were informed that our booked car is not available with the excuse “we have no mustang or camaro available because your rental days are too long“. We were offered a BMW 4 or with a little additional charge a BMW 6. Do not get us wrong this was a nice and kind offer we had appreciated but as we were made a roundtrip through the US and we wanted to have a full american feeling this was not what we wanted. In the fact we are absolutely not satisfied and will not choose this rental station or even SIXT again.<//review>

We at Sixt endeavor to provide our clients with their requested car preference.

(Translated by Google) I can only write good things about the company and the employees here. I went in, said I had a reservation and the guy had already arranged it. There were many cars in it so it was even possible to select. I also chose a Volvo XC90 that was only 500 miles away, so it could be a 1-2 week car. Next time I come here!

(Original)
Csak jókat tudok írni, a cégről is és az itteni alkalmazottakról is. Bementem, mondtam hogy van foglalásom és a srác már intézte is. Sok autó volt bennt így még válogatni is lehetett. Választottam is egy Volvo XC90-et, amiben csak 500 mérföld volt, szóval 1-2 hetes autó lehetett. Legközelebb is ide jövök!</review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Small, but fine station with good cars and RSA, with which to negotiate upgrades.

Have for a road trip in California get a BMW 430i convertible, which was a bit worn, but still worth every dollar.

Kleine, aber feine Station mit guten Autos und RSA, mit denen sich über Upgrades verhandeln lässt.

Habe für einen Roadtrip in California ein BMW 430i Cabrio bekommen, das zwar schon etwas abgenutzt, aber dennoch jeden $ wert war.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObYC6jEbJt4nSAmIogF9R-4-3hcFB5vRGsVbc6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZ9q935WslRovmucX-1yc1LNK9CP8WDpPtCjlV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMp99TLFUmLkgUnCjGPniqWOLEFIC59MKBhDmeT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCG3zWSKLO2agZS0ScRdWA4mvJ1YUdwrZWCfM5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1_pLAH96j9BfGIyxKENyppcl2xIbZt4qHxOW8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdxxQNXeifEeb0jQATQezba4YAYXINGQQciMbv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< resp>

<text>(Translated by Google) Poor service, the worst experience I've had at a video store. I rented a suv because I needed a bag for 3 large luggage and when they arrived at the store they had no car of the category sUv and put me girls down because I was in a hurry a suburban with an extra daily rate of 50 dollars a day, being that The car I had rented was only $ 74 a day, with the extra $ 124 a day and I showed the store manager that the vehicle he was charging me was $ 89 a day and yet he charged $ 50 a day. daily. As I was extremely late I ended up settling and sent an email to Sixt awaiting a position. I'm waiting for a position

Péssimo atendimento, o pior experiência que tive em uma locadora. Aluguei um suv pois precisava de mala para 3 bagagens grandes e ao chegar à loja eles não tinham ninguém carro da categoria sUv e me colocaram girls a baixo pois eu estava com pressa uma suburban com uma taxa diária extra de 50 dólares ao dia, sendo q o carro q eu havia locado custava apenas 74 dólares a diária,com o extra ficou em 124 dólares a diária sendo que mostrei ao gerente da loja que o veículo que ele estava me cobrando custava 89 dólares a diária e mesmo assim ele cobrou os 50 dólares de diária. Como estava extremamente atrasado acabei acatando para resolver e enviei email a Sixt aguardando uma posição. Estou aguardando uma posição</text>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) Great service and very friendly staff. We had the pick up one day when the transit of several main streets of LA was closed to cars for the exclusive use of bicycles, so from the office they managed everything perfect so that you did not have any incidence when picking up our car.

<Resp>None< /Resp><Text>(Translated by Google) To avoid !

I had made a reservation on 10/18 for a Toyota Yaris to be picked up at the Sixt agency in West Hollywood in Los Angeles. This car was reserved for 10/30 at 11 a.m. until 9/11 at 11 a.m.

It turns out that when I arrived at the agency to collect the car on 30/10, the car was not available and no other car at the same price was. I was asked to come back at 2 p.m. and that she would be available. So I came back at 2 p.m. and the car was still not available.

I can understand that some customers are late on the return of the car and I can accept to wait a few hours even if a commercial gesture would have been appreciable on your part. On the other hand, asking me to wait so long to find myself unable to honor my request is deplorable and indicates an appalling quality of service from a car rental agency.

Your agents on site took more than 30 minutes to find a solution to my problem. First I was offered a much more expensive car by offering me a reduction. Intrigued to be able to benefit from a Cadillac for less than a Toyota Yaris, I dig the subject with the agent and discover that in fact the reduction applies to a daily rate but that the total price will be double that that I have already paid for. I am starting to lose patience, I had reserved and paid for this car 12 days before, I still could not benefit from it 3 hours after the agreed schedule and I was offered an upgrade by disguising the fact that it would involve additional costs. It is simply outrageous.

Finally the agency offers me to pick up a car at the same price as mine in another agency, in Downtown LA and offers to go there with a rental van. It should be understood here that I am asked to do a job of exchanging cars between two Sixt agencies, therefore to do the work of the employees for them. And it's the only solution if I want to be able to recover a car at the price I paid. Another proof, if need be, of a dismal service.

What does it matter if I had an appointment elsewhere and that going to this agency distances me from several tens of kilometers from my appointment. What also matters to put in my hands a van whose volume is disproportionate compared to the city car that I had booked while experiencing, in addition, an incomparable urban traffic: that of Los Angeles.

I end up doing the car exchange at the Sixt agency in Downtown LA and leave with a Volkswagen Jetta at 3:45 pm. It was not the car I had reserved and we were 4:45 behind the time I was supposed to pick it up. The quality of service is catastrophic.

To flee !

(Original)
À éviter !

J'avais effectué une réservation le 18/10 pour une Toyota Yaris à récupérer à l'agence Sixt de West Hollywood à Los Angeles. Cette voiture était réservée pour le 30/10 à 11h jusqu'au 9/11 à 11h.

Il se trouve que lorsque je suis arrivé à l'agence pour récupérer la voiture le 30/10, la voiture n'était pas disponible et aucune autre voiture au même prix ne l'était. On m'a demandé de revenir à 14h et qu'elle serait disponible. Je suis donc revenu à 14h et la voiture n'était toujours pas disponible.

Je peux comprendre que certains clients aient du retard sur le retour de la voiture et je peux accepter de patienter quelques heures même si un geste commercial aurait été appréciable de votre part. En revanche, me demander de patienter autant de temps pour se retrouver dans l'incapacité d'honorer ma demande est déplorable et dénote d'une qualité de service affligeante de la part d'une agence de location de voiture.

Vos agents sur place ont mis plus de 30 minutes à trouver une solution à mon problème. D'abord on m'a proposé une voiture beaucoup plus chère en me proposant une réduction. Intrigué de pouvoir bénéficier d'une Cadillac pour moins cher qu'une Toyota Yaris, je creuse le sujet avec l'agent et découvre qu'en fait la réduction s'applique à un tarif journalier mais que le prix total sera le double de ce que j'ai déjà payé. Je commence à perdre patience, j'avais réservé et payé cette voiture 12 jours auparavant, je ne pouvais toujours pas en bénéficier 3h après l'horaire convenu et on me proposait un surclassement en déguisant le fait que cela impliquerait des frais supplémentaire. C'est tout simplement scandaleux.

Finalement l'agence me propose de récupérer une voiture au même prix que la mienne dans une autre agence, à Downtown LA et me propose de m'y rendre avec un van de location. Il faut bien comprendre ici qu'on me demande de faire un travail d'échange de voitures entre deux agences Sixt, donc de faire le travail des employés à leur place. Et c'est la seule solution si je veux pouvoir récupérer une voiture au prix que j'avais payé. Encore une preuve, si l'en est besoin, d'un service lamentable.

Qu'importe si j'avais rendez-vous ailleurs et que me rendre dans cette agence m'éloigne de plusieurs dizaines de kilomètres de mon rendez-vous. Qu'importe également de me mettre entre les mains un van dont le volume est disproportionné comparé à la citadine que j'avais réservé en éprouvant, de surcroit, un traffic urbain inégalable : celui de Los Angeles.

Je finis par faire l'échange de voiture à l'agence Sixt de Downtown LA et repart avec une Volkswagen Jetta à 15h45. Ce n'était pas la voiture que j'avais réservé et nous avions 4h45 de retard sur l'heure à laquelle j'étais censé la récupérer. La qualité du service est catastrophique.

(Translated by Google) When picking up the vehicle was not ready, so you had to wait about half an hour the staff was friendly. It is a little unattractive that the vehicle was put on the farm when it was filled up, but a refueling charge was made on the final bill.

(Original)
Bei Abholung war das Fahrzeug noch nicht fertig, so dass man noch ca. eine halbe Stunde warten musste das Personal war jedoch freundlich. Etwas unschön ist, dass das Fahrzeug bei Abgabe vollgetankt auf den Hof gestellt wurde, bei der Endabrechnung jedoch eine Betankung in Rechnung gestellt wurde.</Review>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Stayed on Venice beach for a 2 day stay and wanted some late night eats. Made it a half hour before close and they were so nice in still accommodating us. Ordered their Combination Fried Rice. Absolutely amazing presentation and some of the best fried rice ive ever had. My mate had their curry and only had good things to say. Highly recommend this place if your visiting or living nearby looking for good food.< /review><username>Scott Carey</username><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2baa2c1ad9729:0xe8c4b9f601081a5f<//Gmap_id>< time>

<text>Food is delicious. 5 stars. But...

Minus one star because I've only got a 50% success rate of getting "very spicy" when I order. Tonight I specified max spicy, saw "2 stars" on the receipt when I picked up my order, then got home to find no chili in my dish whatsoever. I got more of a burn from my piping hot soup than I did from my main dish.

Please. When I say "extra spicy" I MEAN IT. Don't give me Midwestern White Guy spicy. It's enough to make me stop ordering.<//text><Date>1616905523883</Date>< rating>

<rate>1</rate><Text>This place used to be my favorite Thai spot, but they renovated during the pandemic and added a new seating area and it appears that they cannot keep up with the increase of dine in customers.  I have ordered from here 3 times in the past month and every time it takes at least twice as long as the wait time they give you.  The first time I went back it took an hour and 20 minutes for egg rolls and a noodle dish (they were packed I will give them that) the second time I went back I gave them an extra 10 min until I drove over to get my food and they forgot to put in my order they said it will be ready in 10 minutes, I come back and they forgot to put in my order the second time as well, making me wait around an hour and a half again, for egg rolls and a noodle dish, this last time I went they gave me a 30 minutes wait time, I came 30 min late anticipating the super long wait, and still had to wait another 30 min in the restaurant so it took them an another hour and a half to make my food and they skimped me on an egg rolls on top of all of that, once again this place used to be my favorite Thai place, but because of these experiences I’ve had since the remodel I cannot say that I will be returning even though the food is amazing I cannot deal with the wait times being 3X longer than they tell me and skimping me on top of all of it.  Hope you guys can get it together at some point.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

All of the dishes are good if you are not a heavy meat eater since most of the dish does not have large amount of meat.</Text>

We went in June 2020 for a family vacation. Stayed close by as we wanted to walk to the beach, and the pier and then we found this gem right near the beach. We actually ate here twice as the food was so good and the drink selection was solid. Service was good but not outstanding.

I ordered the fried calamari, fried rice, coconut shrimp and tom yum soup. The portions and the food was very disappointing especially for the price.  Not much flavor. I've been recommended this place by my godmother especially since I live so close. I'm sorry to say I won't be returning.< /text>

Small restaurant next to the Venice Canals. Food was excellent! I'm giving it a 4 because only outdoor seating is available. Umbrellas provide shade. The green curry was nice and rich , not watered down. And their papaya salad and angel wings were flavorful and delicious as well!< /Review>

<Review>Excellent service and quality!

The menu was clean and organized. Finally a menu with lots of nice pictures of foods. Excellent and so helpfulI. I wish other restaurant's menu could have more pictures.

The staff were kind and helpful.

As we entered in to the restaurant during lunch time, many visitors were there to eat.

We were quickly helped to sit down at a table and right away and another waitress came to receive our order.

We ordered several different dishes. The food were hot, fresh and tasted excellent!

The amount of salt in the food was ok but the amount of sugar in salads and other dishes were more than expected. We wish the sugar could be less and they could serve some sugar at side so the customer themself can decide how much sugar they want to add.

The waiting time from order to be served was ok.

The restroom:
We didn't see any restroom. Does this place have restroom?

Here are some pictures I took.< /Review>< UserId.>

Very good Thai food with wonderful service. Tasty dishes, including lots of less common ones. Mostly outdoor seating, hence the name "Garden- so dress accordingly if it's cold (they do have heat lamps). Not sure what they do when it rains!<//review>

<Review>What a wonderful place.  We stopped here after touring the Venice Canal houses.  We had the Krispy Ka Prao Chicken and the Roasted Duck Curry with a side of white, steamed rice.

First, the ambiance is just amazing. We sat outside, our table overlooking the canal, a fresh breeze lightly blowing in on a warm and sunny winter day.

The chicken was tender, falling off the bone, with a sticky, crispy skin and crispy basil. I probably could have eaten another entire serving.  The curry had a beautiful kick of spice to it and the duck was tasty.

The service was great too.  The server kept our water glasses full and checked in on us several times.

We would definitely return here again.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

The food here is fantastic but the service can be somewhat inattentive. We waited more than 15 minutes for cutlery that never came even after we asked for it. I ended up getting some myself. No one offered us water when our glasses were empty. Having said that, this is still my favourite Thai restaurant in LA. It's reasonably priced and absolutely delicious.< /Text>

Where to begin, this restaurant was conveniently located to the Inn at Venice beach. The service is friendly and go out of their way to help with dietary restrictions. I was able to order salmon larb and Thai iced tea with coconut milk instead of cream based. Everything was delicious and served in a timely manner. I also appreciate the fact that I didn't need a reservation. I highly recommend this restaurant.<//text>

<review>A great mini restaurant, great food and great service. I recommend two plates: 1. Thai soup whit seafoods 2. Phat Thai noodles, simply spectacular with a great atmosphere The beer is wonderful and the Te too. Not conventional food but simply delicious. I recommend too the Thai Ice Te and after lunch you can walk between the Venice canals.</review><user_name>Cataro Michel Guerrero<//user_name><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPK_0ykEqxzI5fPyr3YGKEl90FKWHmpy8kmHYJE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOaaw3nro9ViUZi9VDw9VGHyy6Ai1S735wxp6x_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMoCAtWrY9PzHAQIF1VHK1vri31O8nfvFbVIUib=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< resp>

<rate>3</rate><user_name>Reyginald Rabel</user_name><Review>Considering I was the only one at the restaurant when I got there for lunch, the service was very slow. I had the pad Thai and the sticky rice with mango for dessert: the pad Thai was forgettable - nothing about it would make me want to try it again or make a strong recommendation for it. The rice from the sticky rice with mango was clearly undercooked. In all, if you are in the area and want Thai food, consider looking elsewhere.<//Review><Resp>None<//Resp><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFdJg7T9nc7QVxvocy4mKAJC2RKst5Q2cuA6dC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMyAVP6KZIxjIbKmSvpAMv8PatEAyr8md78z-yP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzGKo97WdFiolpQQZNNDtjrLRAUDouYpDPQbud=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODZyZSIyMMuNhBR0bCGCVIWZF5gVlrwWK1zOxf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO82eQmERcGrIyanj1JO9TPmbq9aBI5l6b4zxKl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><UserId.>109057494233568540836</UserId.><GmapID>0x80c2baa2c1ad9729:0xe8c4b9f601081a5f< /GmapID><Date>1484555558799</Date></record></dataset><record>

Very good Thai food in nice location. Nothing fancy, but really a nice place particularly at day time. We had a weird waiter, but the fresh coconut made up for it.<//review>

We ordered fried tofu and massamam curry. It was hearty and tasty. Liked the green ambiance.</Review>

The food is good and it's reasonably priced, go to service in basic cafeteria service they do not go the extra mile. The Waitresses barely speak English and just take your order and bring you your food you never see them again.<//Text>< Pics>

For salads, we loved the glass noodle salad as well as the papaya salad (Som Tum). The Siamese Hot Pot Delight soup is delicious and lovely. The Deep Sea Diamond from the specialty menu was also great. Even the mango sticky rice had a special touch. Oh, and their fresh coconuts are delicious! Very fresh.

The patio is lovely in good weather and they have kind service.<//review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

They may not have the biggest portions but the quality is top notch. I can definitely say that their Pad Thai, Pad See Ew, Tom Ka, mango and sticky rice are must haves.<//review>

Food was very good; nice outdoor atmosphere but our waiter today???!! Not sure what his trip was but what a POOR attitude 😡😡. Just in case he doesn’t know: we are the customer & would appreciate at least a modicum of enthusiasm that we were at your restaurant 🤔🤔.<//Text>

Hidden, small and nice Thai style restaurant right at the end of Venice Canals.
Pretty quite of Saturday afternoon, enjoying the sunset.
Dishes arrived quickly, all of them were great and to our taste.
Price reasonable too!
Definitely will come back soon< /Review>

Amazing place! I got the pineapple fried rice and my wife got the #2 pad see ew. The rice there is amazing and the pad see ew comes with flat noodles and they were great. We both got beef so not sure on the other meats but it was fantastic. The service was eh just two people handling busing and serving so we only had two interactions he took our order for food and drink and the food being brought and we found them for the check. Food though was five stars!</review>

A bit pricey but the food is delicious. Ordered a papaya salad(requested spicy, but came medium spicy for my taste), beef satay came in 5 little skewers(11.95), eggplant with tofu and sweet and sour beef and a large rice (5$).< /text>

The very best part; ending the day after a long walk seeing the sights. While we didn’t even remember what we ate (the food was F.A.B.) it was the warm welcome hospitality that was the most memorable for this Midwestern couple. Will definitely come back!< /Review>

Slow and inattentive service. Charged extra for rice when you order curry (although that might be a thing at Thai restaurants out here). That's like charging for noodles when you order spaghetti. Bland drunken noodles. Seems like a tourist trap.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Great little place right on the side of the canals walkway. Seated in a timely manner outside. The staff was hurrying around and doing their job. We ordered 2 entrees, this is where the problem started. My Pad Thai arrived in about 10 minutes, quick for how busy they were however my guest ordered the Emerald Curry arrived 15 minutes after mine. When questioned about this the staff had no excuse and just said sorry. This to me is totally unacceptable and a total failure on the front and back of house communication. The food was great, the timing was terrible.</text>

<Text>The portions are small, but delicious. Very cozy place, but there is some indoor seating. Don't come here if you have plans for later on a weekend though; they are often short-staffed and I've been here enough times to say that you will be here at minimum 1.5 hours.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<review>I love the food here. If it’s super busy you will need to wait but for the price and location and yummy level you get to suck it up.

<Review>Was meeting family here for lunch today (Mother's Day). My daughter and I waited  by the entrance but no one greeted us. While my family was finding parking, I took my daughter, who has a medical condition, to use the restroom. I'm waiting outside the restroom and this server runs up to me and YELLS at me that the restroom is for customers only. I told her we were customers but the rest of the party was parking. She continued to YELL at me that I should have waited and should have asked before going to the bathroom. After she finished yelling I called my family and told them we couldn't eat there because we felt so unwelcome. Who does that? I get it, you're not a public bathroom but we were customers who were never greeted and to yell at a child and her parent for using the restroom, please. Get over yourself lady. It's not that serious. Never going back again</Review>< name>

Stumbled across this little gem whilst on a stroll back to the hotel from Venice beach. Delicious food and excellent service! I got the drunken noodles and they were to die for, just the right level of spice! Nice quirky outdoor setting.</Review>

<review>Was looking forward to a romantic dinner in this small intimate restaurant. A total disaster!! My husband's food arrived, and after 20 minutes of waiting for my dinner, I finally asked the waiter in charge about my dinner. He informed me that the chicken I had ordered took 20 minutes and the  waitress was new, and had not informed me the wait. I told him she should not have brought my husband's dinner way before mine was ready! I did not receive my dinner, and eventually asked the waiter to cancel my order as my husband was finished eating. I asked for something already prepared and choose the chicken sticks and friedrice. I received a huge mound of rice and 4-5 chicken sticks. My original order had not been removed from the bill! We finally settled the bill and it was $20.00 for my part, which was 4-5 chicken sticks and some refried rice. No comp was given for the long delay!! Would never go back to that restaurant!!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Pretty good. A little overpriced for what you get, but still pretty reasonable considering this is right off the boardwalk. Friendly service, though a little slow.</text>

Unique for the reason that we have never eaten Thai food that tasted that bad before. Quick service, though not as quick as our regret in our choice of restaurants.< /text>

Prices are too high.
I asked for green paypay salad...it is a Thai resturant. They told me it cost to much they stopped making it. ....seriously_?!
No Fresh Spring Rolls either.
They got my order wrong also.
Rice not included w entree.</Text>

We took a take out. The portions were half of the takeout containers. Also food was grossly oily. Literally floating in oil.< /review>

<review>(Translated by Google) After admiring the canal, we walked into this lovely Thai restaurant to have a meal. We sat in an outdoor location, surrounded by beautiful plants, and we could enjoy fireworks while eating.
We ordered fried shrimp, fried chicken wings, spring rolls, fried rice, green curry and Thai rice, which were unexpectedly delicious! The waitress was very enthusiastic to ask whether our spicy level was acceptable, the service was great and delicious, and a family of four left with a full meal

(Original)
欣賞完運河，走進這間可愛的泰國餐廳用餐，我們坐在戶外的位置，周圍種滿了各種植物很美，一邊吃飯還可以欣賞到煙火。
我們點了炸蝦、炸雞翅、春卷、炒飯、綠咖哩和泰國米，出乎意料之外很好吃喔！服務小姐很熱心詢問我們的辣度能否接受，服務很棒也好吃，一家四口吃得飽飽的離開< /review>< Pictures>

<text>Sonny is actually one of my friends from college so I knew him before starting the process of applying for a home loan. I knew he was reliable and thorough so my wife and I wanted to recruit his help in buying our first home. Sonny explained everything thoroughly and would even record videos for us to explain certain aspects of the loan that we didn't quite understand. He was always readily available and didn't hesitate to answer all of our questions, even if he had to explain the same thing twice. Sonny made applying for a mortgage seamless and easy. There was one time where I felt the numbers were not adding up, but he was able to extremely break it down for us, number by number, cost by cost. I was really appreciative of this. There's not a bank or credit union that would give you the time that Alquizar gave us. He communicated well with our realtor and their teamwork made our home buying experience practically stress-free. I would definitely recommend Sonny to all of my friends and family!</text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80d95528a945fe65:0xa22ed1d8c1876098< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Anthony did an incredible job on our loan and ushering us through the process of buying our home. He not only answered a multitude of questions I had on numerous calls but also had us preapproved/underwritten so we could make the most competitive offer in this crazy market. Once under contract he followed up with me, both realtors, the escrow company, title company, etc. throughout the transaction to ensure we closed within the 21 days we promised to the seller. He was so efficient we could have closed in 14 days! I have already referred him to a couple family members and will use him on my next transaction. Thanks Anthony!!!</review>

<Review>Sonny was just a gem during this whole process. I originally reached out to see how much I could afford and he was even able to connect me with a real estate agent. He was very communicative, found the best way to close fast with minimal paperwork, and overall this was a smooth and stressfree process. Highly recommend to any other buyers looking for a lender.

As usual, Summer was great to work with.  We have worked with Summer on three different occasions and we had different desires for all three loans. Summer was very helpful in determining the right strategy for our needs each time and has always made the process smooth. Her communication, organization, and desire to help are unmatched. Thanks Summer !</Text>

<rate>5<//rate><username>David Mills</username><Review>Working with Kelly from APM was a lovely experience. He is very personable and informative, which was really helpful since we had a ton of questions throughout the process. Kelly also communicates quickly and often when needed via phone, email, or text, whatever was best given the situation. There were some issues at the end of the process with APM and not being able to meet our intended closing timeline due to a bottleneck in their processing, but Kelly still communicated with us and did what he could, even when it was just discussing the bad news. Overall we had a positive lending experience with APM despite the issues at the end with the company, but 10/10 would recommend Kelly to someone if they need a lender. He was great to work with!<//Review><Date>1598826744587</Date></record>

Amazing service provided by Doug Siebenthal and his associates at American Pacific Mortgage!!  Everyone on the team went above and beyond to push our refi through by the end of the year for us.  We are so grateful to have found Doug. He really is the best- his follow-up is amazing, always going the extra mile to help us. Always appreciate someone who works as hard as Doug does.< /Review>

<Review>Not only was Mark's service excellent, but his knowledge in the lending industry was good as well. He treats his customers with respect and puts their needs first above all. He was consistently reliable and fast to respond to my inquiries. All around a good guy to work with and helped lower my anxiety during the home buying process!< /Review>< gmapID>

<username>Jennifer Vinson<//username><Review>Friendly, personable, and consistent communication!  From beginning to end, Kelly Goertzen made our re-fi experience a smooth and informed one. He notified us each step of the way, clearly and thoroughly answered all of our questions. Kelly always made time for us, even pulling over to the side of the road if necessary to complete a call & transfer of documents.

Very professional team, overall, and would recommend without hesitation.</Review><resp>None</resp></record>

Top notch professional.

Mr. Rieger was very patient about explaining the process and costs of my two refi’s.  Recently, I came across a lower cost offer and he invited me to provide details and in the end encouraged me to pursue the competing company as it would be cheaper. (He joked he might go with them)

In the end his offers were close enough (maybe a touch more expensive)  that I ended up going with his company as I deeply appreciated his willingness to go through each cost line by line.  (Remember, I was looking at another company’s offer!)

He was patient and NEVER disparaged the other company when weighing offers. The competing company either was unable or unwilling to explain their costs that i felt uncomfortable in pursing their offer any further.

Bob was patient and transparent in each step of the way.  I found myself saving money, being better educated, and always comfortable by going with Mr. Rieger.<//Review>

Douglas Siebenthal has my highest respect and admiration for the manner in which he processed my recent VA loan experience.  He was constantly willing to clarify each and every question I had.   I learned so much from  him.    He was always courteous, patient, and kind.  Also, he responded to my every question in a very timely manner.

I give him five stars and my sincere gratitude for his unending efforts.  You will never regret using his services.

My loan officer, Sonny Alquizar, made the whole process completely painless. I was updated on a biweekly basis about the status of my escrow and any necessary documents and deadlines, Sonny found me special offers based on my employment status as a teacher, and he was completely transparent with all the paperwork and “numbers” that were going to be needed in order to make homeownership possible for me. The process went very smooth and felt very easy thanks to Sonny’s hard work and the professionalism of everyone on the APM team. I would highly recommend Sonny and APM to anyone looking to start the home-buying process.</review>< Pics>

Carter, Grant and Brent KNOW their job VERY well...and that's taking care of their clients. We are first time home buyers and the details of every step they provided truly made us feel at ease. All are super thorough and detailed. They answered all of our questions. Advised us when we needed advise. Answered all of our calls, texts, emails almost immediately. We purchased out of state and it felt like they were next to us holding our hands every step of the way. To top it off, we got an amazing interest rate locked in! Thank you all again from our family to you three for making our dream into reality.< /review>

Brent, Carter and Grant are an awesome team. We just recently closed on our house and the process was so much easier having them. They were able to answer any question and/or resolve any issue that arose. We were actually able to close in under 30 days, which was great for us. Would definitely recommend using them especially if you're using a VA Home Loan.< /Review>

<Review>This is one talented group of young professionals. They're knowledgeable about all types of loan products and are diligent about closing your transaction in a timely manner. Their operations team always goes above and beyond, putting in extra hours daily, to ensure you don't fall behind in your close of escrow. Their sales team communicates through every step of the process, making sure you're always well informed. I recommend this team to anyone looking to purchase a new home or refinance their existing home. If there were more than 5 stars available in this review, I would give it to them. Give them a call today!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

They understand that buying a home is probably the largest and one of the most important purchases of one's life and as a result everyone here is incredibly attentive and responsive. Not only do they walk you through the loan process with ease, but they make sure that no question goes unanswered so that you are able to make the most informed decision possible. 5/5 Stars, Definitely recommend!!<//Text>< Pics>

I worked with Doug Siebenthal with American Pacific Mortgage and he was truly amazing.  I was looking into a new community with a preferred lender, and it was not a great experience.  I felt like one of many clients trying to get this agents attention.  So last minute, I switched to Doug.   I had worked with Doug while looking for single family homes and the attention to detail he had to my loan as well as to me and my situation was top notch.  He listened, reached out to me all throughout the process and since I had switched lenders, was able to get all of the deadlines met ahead of schedule.  Made a stressful situation bearable.  If you want someone who has your best interests at heart, I whole heartedly recommend Doug. He went above and beyond for me and my family.<//text>

Very easy to work with. The branch uses a lot of communication tools to make it easier to follow where your loan is in the process. They are also very easy to get a hold of and very responsive. Almost everyone here works evenings and weekends just to accommodate the client. Thanks for the great service guys!< /review>

< Review>
What can I say about APM that hasn’t already been said about the wheel, penicillin or the IPhone. This is one of the greatest lenders of all time!! My husband and I would argue constantly over who got to talk to our lender. It’s one of those chores no one wants to do, you know the old I spent the entire day reading to our children or I took out the trash so it’s your turn. Not here, we both enjoyed every minute of the lending process and could get hold of them anytime day night weekends, wow what service <//Review>

<rating>5< /rating><text>My wife and I used American Pacific Mortgage for a refinance last month.  The process was fast, efficient and everyone we spoke with was extremely helpful and friendly.  The loan officer helped us lock on the best (lowest rate) day of the month thanks to his knowledge and instincts.  It was the best mortgage / loan experience we've ever had.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80d95528a945fe65:0xa22ed1d8c1876098</gmap_id></record>

Not only do I work here but I have also had the opportunity to get my home loan through APM.  I already knew I would get great service but actually experiencing it from the other side really helped me appreciate the hard work that goes into getting a home loan.< /text>

Fernando made our experience fun and easy. From the minute we got there to test drive the vehicle we were handed the keys and let go. We ask for additional accessories with the vehicle and we’re immediately accommodated. By the end of our visit we drove off in our new Acadia AT4.</review>

The people I dealt with were masked and observed protocol.  I thank them for that.
I was somewhat alarmed that some other people that were around GM didn't have masks covering both their noses and their mouths.  Another customer was inside without a mask.  The service, however, was good like I always had.<//Review>

< Review>
I Purchased car from GMC such high class name but delivered mediocre service. The company knows that the car they sold us has brought so many hardship to us. I have had the car in the shop 10 X in a year. They have offered no solutions and continue to have me pay for things that should be covered in the contract. I bought an additional coverage policy and they still wanted me to pay for unexpected breakdown covered in a warranty.
I was a honest paying customer but didn't get the service back in return. No follow from managers, everything is funneled through your representatives in the company that try to communicate but know little about customer satisfaction and leadership. No follow up from managers on issues that may need their interaction.
Good businesses will put people in place in the organization that they are trustworthy and confident to do the right thing regardless of paperwork stipulation, at the end of the day businesses should stand on whats honest, fair, transparency and trust. This is what separates the elite business from average.
Take some time and pop the hood on your businesses occasionally and if you want to know what's really going on and the culture you have, talk to the person that makes the lease amount of money in your business. They are usually the ones that are the closest to problem and will give you an honest testimony.
you will hear from me again.

<text>This was the best experience I've had. Scheduling my appointment was easy, I was able to get next day. The front desk representative was professional, nice, and friendly. She was very accurate with the wait time quote she gave me, they even finished a little earlier than promised. While I was waiting a sales representative let me browse the cars on the lot, no pressure and had friendly conversation. This is why I will continue to drive a GMC and get serviced at this dealer.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1567800777289, 'text': 'Brittany, thanks for the positive review and comments, we are happy to have lived up and maybe even exceeded your expectations.

They are not pushy at all and understand you when you say you are looking for something  in particular . They don’t try to push you to get something else you don’t want. Out of All the places I have bought vehicles I have now found a place I will ALWAYS come to for my vehicles. Larry the sales Manager here at Visalia GMC is AWESOME he went above and beyond I am very grateful for that. He really went out of his way to help me. If I owned a dealership he is definitely a person I would want on my team. You don’t find many people like him very Honest and respectful! Also the salesman Andrew was awesome too. As I said he helped me find what I really wanted and was never pushy. So Thanks Visalia GMC you have earned a lifetime customer!< /text>< GmapID>

<Text>i purchased a vehicle from them a few years ago. at the time of purchase they sold me the auto butler paint protector service for 3 yrs. i was told then that the contract was transferable to a new vehicle if i traded the vehicle in the future. well its not. i just traded my SUV in for a new truck a few weeks ago and they told me i basically lost out on the rest of the contract. its not transferable and its not refundable. so if you buy 6 applications of auto butler (they are done every 6 mo) and you trade your car in after 3 applications you don't get your money back for the remainder of the 3.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1572618711238, 'text': 'Junior, sorry for the confusion, the fact is Auto Butler is not transferrable to another vehicle, it may be transferable to the next purchaser of your vehicle in the event that you were to sell your vehicle to a private party.

I had a great experience here, buying a brand new pickup.  Fernando Gonzalez was my salesperson, and he made a stressful purchase easy.  He made me feel comfortable and did not apply too much pressure (which I have definitely experienced before with others). I needed to sleep on my decision and that was perfectly fine.  I ended up making a decision the next day with his help.  He showed me everything I needed to know and answered all my questions. The finance person was personable and easy to work with as well. I recommended this dealership and recommend asking for Fernando.< /Text>

Where do I start with such a long list..this is for the service dept.
In short, my vehicle has been in almost 40 times with about half of those visits within a few months trying to fix the issue. In the end, the issue wasn't fully fixed and now I'm dealing with new issues since having my car in to get "fixed". My vehicle is now out of warranty so taking it in to get looked at or fixed is going to charge me because they can't find out what's still wrong and say everything is good.  How does someone take their vehicle in only to get it back with more issues, but supposedly everything is good? I know my vehicle pretty well and there are issues. Trying to find out how to reach the owner directly so I can talk to someone who can hopefully actually help me as I have too much to explain on this review.</text>

Came in to the dealership looking to get a specific vehicle that my girlfriend was interested in a 2016 Chevy Malibu! Special thanks to Manuel Dias for helping us get a great offer on our purchase!

I made an appointment and when I showed up I was told it would be an hour wait because they do the walk ins before they do appointments. After they checked my vehicle and I went to sit in the waiting room I was told it would actually take longer between an 1.25 hours or 1.5 hours. I made an appointment so I didn't have to wait, but apparently appointments isn't important to this dealership.</text>

<review>When I first purchased my truck I rated them high, but I have an issue with them lying. I traded in a 2016 Honda CRV with less than 13000 miles on it and got a 2017 GMC Canyon due to my father passing and us taking over his business. Well I was owed back $2400 from Honda for GAP, warranty and maintenance plan I purchased. Instead of giving me my $2400 I’m being told they used it as a down payment but yet I was never informed of it until now. They don’t want to give me the money I’m entitled to. I told them I’m not putting anything down because of my trade in and they agreed. I now have to go tomorrow to talk to the finance person that helped us because he wasn’t there.
I will NEVER buy another vechile from them again. Be careful when you go here.<//review>< userid>

Horrible people work here if I give them a negative 10 I would. Andrew the sales man is alright not bad but the guy that put the numbers together to make the deal is an embarrassment they should all get fired. They are all crooks if you want to get screwed then go to Visalia Buick gmc. How these guys still have jobs is beyond me. If you want a Chevy giant Chevy is way better. To be perfectly honest and Ed deanas is good too.< /review>

<text>I will never get a truck or any car from this dealership. Told us we could get a gmc Denali at 4.99 Apr and we signed all the papers and everything and they let us take the truck thinking we owned it but called me 4 days later saying we didn't get approved for 4.99 Apr and it would be 9+ Apr. Very bad business, why would you let someone leave with a truck after signing papers saying x y and z then go back on all the numbers you crunched together to get us the truck. First time I went there they were too pushy, 2nd time I went there they change the Apr after guaranteeing we would get a low Apr, this place is all around a horrible dealership.<//text>< pics>

Nicely maintained. Located close to freeway, easy to find. Nice fairways with tall rough.  Not too difficult if you keep on the short grass. Greens can be tricky to read,  pay attention to your competitors!  Nice pro shop and cafe.  A few tricky tee shots but overall a good place to try<//Review>

Very lush Fringe areas nice and green, they had plugged the fairways so you will be sitting in a hole now and then, greens were plugged probably 2 to 3 weeks so you got the zig zag roll. Other than that, course was in good shape. Naturally when we made the tee time they did not tell us about the plugging.< /review>

<Review>I visited this golf course in on Thanksgiving Day of 2020. Courses are well maintained and greens are great. Not too hard golf course overall and you can definitely have fun out here. View is okay compared to other well known courses. Definitely recommend for checking it out.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<Text>The course was in great shape-lush fairways and true greens but very narrow. Brung your straight shots. But, when we booked, they quoted a $110 per player cost for a 16 person tournament. A little steep, but ok. Its Monterey. When we go to pay, they tell us then there is a $25 additional cost per person, per cart!!! Course was good, but not $135 good.  Sorry Del Monte. Be more upfront for your tournaments.<//Text>< pics>

<Text>Love this place. I little nod to the old school. Fairly narrow off the tee, plenty of healthy rough, well placed bunkers, and small sloping greens all point back to the way courses used to be designed. Still challenging but in a different way.</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNiFtmTiwoDXnmuFk_8d1DJpzH7358e77B5ABYS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_bBBy3ro_Pg10oSs2Hm5jqhQBDlEot4j0iUWS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNH1DUr7DqUhzr_6H-2w63legbS_SPzhHu26_F=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJEj4RIEnsLd-vFM_PgSALfgf8epVLVysH-L5D=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< response>

Great course, always in great shape. Tougher test than you'd think with the shorter yardage and no water hazards but it will fool you. Love it! Good food at the clubhouse too!</review>

I really liked this course. Challenging and the greens were spectacular! Nothing real flat on the greens and the speeds were fast and true. Looks like they take good care of this place. I only got into one bunker and it was thin of sand. This was a tournament for me so I don't know the regular green fees, but I would definitely like to come back.< /review>

On a nice day sit on the Patio.  Food is just ok. Full bar is a plus. Golf Course is in great shape. Rough is tall and hard to get out of. Greens are true and not too slow and not lightening fast. All good.< /Review>

<Review>I went to Del Monte never playing here before. I have to say, it’s extremely expensive for what you get.. they should not be charging resort type rates for this club. Very old school traditional course, up and down, every hole is basically the same. I have played Pebbles other courses, Spyglass, Spanish Bay, and Pebble itself and all of those are amazing courses and well worth the extra money.. don’t waste your time at this place.

I also was told I would get a rental set that fits my playing style when I booked the reservation, (Men’s Left Hand, Stiff Shaft). My own clubs have X Stiff shafts. I get to the course and find out that they don’t even carry a Left Hand Stiff Shaft rental. Very disappointing... had to play with regular shafts. They did comp the rental, which was nice.. but the clubs just didn’t fit my playing style. I wish they had comped by round as well, because anyone that is an avid golfer can attest that it would just be a huge bummer to be used to hitting X Stiff shafts and then have to hit regulars, it was like hitting a childrens set.

I honestly would have left when I got there, had it not been that it was my grand fathers 85th birthday and I was treating him to a round. And he did enjoy it, so that is all that mattered to me at the end of the day. The guys we played with were fantastic as well.

The course just did not meet any of my expectations whatsoever, and the rental club situation was a cherry on top. I’ll pay double/triple to play at Pebble’s other courses, any day.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

- Was playing pretty great for a few holes when I caught up some fellas from the Sonoma State golf team named Chase Fritz and Armand.
- I asked Chase who the big guy hiding in the bushes was; he said, "Oh, that's my dad, Billy."
- Chase Fritz uses the fattest putter grip I've ever seen!
- "You guys wanna play a game?"  -- Chase Fritz
- Armand rocked the bucket hat, and Chase Fritz told me about the time he saw Johnny Manziel throw a hot dog at a PGA event.
- Chase Fritz and Armand told me that the Sonoma State golf team was DI; what, you didn't think I would google it after the round?
- I shanked my mashie into the resort on #16 and doubled; @$*#%!
- Greens are so small I had to borrow my neighbor's magnifying glass just to see them!

< Review>
Very much part of Californian golfing legend, Del Monte is a member of the impressive stable of courses owned and operated by Pebble Beach Resorts. Compared to its peers, which lie to the west on the ocean-facing shoreline of the Monterey Peninsula, Del Monte poses a less demanding and less scenic golfing challenge.
The final holes of this pleasant parkland course are played in front of the Hyatt Regency hotel, the 17th green located just a few feet away from the hotel terrace.< /Review>

Good condition vs last year. Been coming here for three years now and the staff are always awesome. Food and beverage service is great too with friendly service all round.  Remember keep the ball below the hole or you'll have a three putt.</text>

It's a nice course, well kept and much easier and shorter than its sister courses part of Pebble Beach. I think the other courses are nicer but this one is easier and cheaper, nice course overall.</Text>

Great history but only the fairways and greens are actually green. Everything off the fairway was dry and dead. Visually, looked terrible.< /text>

I had been told by other golfers that Del Monte was nothing special but I had to check it off my Monterey bucket list because of it's history. In short I'm sorry I did. After forking over $85 to play I was greeted with
a course that was comparable to a bad municipal track in Russia. Skip this one and play Black Horse or Bayonet.< /Review>

<review>Every August here for the Mecum Auto auctions, the course is closed and bitchn' rides are sold here. The actual place is connected to the Hyatt Regency, due to the drought, the course is a bit dry and fire risky.< /review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) Pebble Beach is the easiest golf course to round out of the four golf courses. It's different from Pebble Beach, Spyglass or Spanish Bays, and it's located on the inland mountain side, so it doesn't have any seaside views, but it's an open course that even beginners can round with well-maintained fairways and good course design.

페블비치 4개 골프 코스중 가장 쉽게 라운딩 가능한 골프장 입니다. 페블비치, 스파이글래스 혹은 스페니쉬 베이 들과는 차이가 있고 내륙 산쪽에 위치해서 바닷가 경치는 하나도 없습니다만 잘 관리된 페어웨이와 무난한 코스 디자인으로 초보들도 라운딩할 수 있는 오픈 코스 입니다.<//review>

(Translated by Google) Golf course in Pebble Beach. This is the easier of the four courses. Quite rustic. There is no pool, and the wind is small without the sea. There is a shop that serves breakfast, clothes, and golf equipment. There is no other beverage restaurant in the 18-hole court, but there are cars selling drinks and meals. There is no shower. It is inconvenient to wash the ball after hitting. But this is a general habit in American courts. It is relatively unaccustomed to Taiwanese golfers.

(Original)
圓石灘內的高爾夫球場。這是四個球場中較為容易的。頗具鄉村風。這沒有水池、不靠海風力較小。有供應早餐、有衣服、球具賣店，18洞場內沒其他飲料餐店，但有賣車巡迴賣飲料餐食。也沒有淋浴設備。擊球完畢無法盥洗，較為不便。不過這是美國球場的一般習慣。對台灣球友而言是較不習慣。</Review>

(Translated by Google) It is a golf course that is played every July since 2001. It is the cheapest golf club in the Pebble Beach Resort and instead is on the mountain side, not on the coast.

(Translated by Google) It was an old and poorly maintained course that was not worth it compared to its reputation. It shouldn't be disregarded just like that of a local golf course, but I'm only sorry to do that.

(Original)
오래되고 관리가 좀 부족한, 명성에 비해 마음에 담기지 않았던 코스였다. 그냥 그런 동네 골프코스정도로 폄하하면 안되는데 그렇게 하게됨이 미안할뿐이다.<//Text>

<review>Yes, it's a bit odd having to rate a McDonald's, but tonight warranted me to actually leave a review. Normally, I'd just take a survey that is on the receipt-- but I didn't even get one. The girl at around 10:45 who was taking payments at the window was not having it.

I had decided last minute that I wanted to grab a coffee and she seemed absolutely disgruntled that I even had the audacity to order more. She even had a fan on (not even sure if that's allowed and keep in mind that it's a chilly night.

I get my food and she just gives it to me all without a single word. No semblance of basic customer service was given. I get it-- I've been there and done that but at least do the bare minimum and bid your customers goodbye or even a thank you.

The food was the usual from McD, but they made sure to practically fill my iced coffee to the brim with ice.

I usually don't really care too much in regards to fast food, but this experience in particular rubbed me the wrong way. Not getting a receipt and receiving customer support at this level is unacceptable for a business. If this is going to be the norm-- I'm afraid I'll take my business elsewhere to the jack in the box down the street. Hell, I'll even drive out of my way to the other mcdonalds on plaza blvd< /review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< Rating>

Nice little dining area, little kids play pen as well. There is no self serve area for sodas, but it was pretty clean overall. My food came fast and hot and my coffee was made perfectly.< /Review>

<text>I mean, it's Whack Arnold's. You get what you pay for 😂😂😂 I only get the deluxe breakfast and ice cream every now and then. I've never had a problem with service and they've never messed up my order, the drive thru employees are always kind and greet me with a, "good morning". They use to accept EBT but they stopped accepting it months ago, I don't know why they would do that (especially with the Covid pandemic going on and people falling on hard times) shame on you McDonald's for not participating in the Restaurant Meals Program in a time of need!<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

My fav spot for delicious cheap food. You will not be disappointed in the menu and service. The staff was friendly and observant. The bill was fair I would say.< /review>

<review>ZERO STARS

Nothing against the staff (they are always really helpful), but I have been going here now for about a month, and every time the soda machine is broken, but I am not told. The drinks are always flat or taste slightly off. If I was told on ordering at least I could order something else.

Fix your drinks machine please

Visited today after about a month, drinks machine was not working at all, so I had to have either tea or orange. I chose orange, then when I got to the register there was an extra charge of $2.50 for the OJ. If your machines are not working you shouldn't be charging your customers extra!

Not going here anymore<//review>< pics>

I didn't like the fact they lied to me . I ordered a mocha frappe and the machine was down so I said switch it to an Oreo McFlurry. They said okay that's fine and still charged me for the frappe ! The worst part is they charged my card after I left . I asked for a receipt and they wouldn't give it to me . I came back to complain to the manager and she tried to lie it was the same price ! I work at a McDonald's so I knew the prices and I told her how can you lie to me when I have the same uniform as you . She tried to say taxes . It's unbelievable a manager can lie to someone that knows how it works as well .< /Text>

Love their burger. Some store seems to pour salt on their burger patties after cooking. Experienced one time at Highland Ave branch, National City. That would be nice. Just not too much. Only a little bit please.<//text>

<text>We had been waiting in the drive-thru for about 20 minutes, we were 4 cars away from ordering and there were at least 6 cars behind us. An employee comes out to tell us that they were closed and the car before ours was the last one they were letting through. We asked why didn't they block the drive-thru at the cut-off time and continued letting cars to line up, then we asked to speak to the manager and the guy (Brandon) said that he was the manager. Then he goes inside and two other employees come out to tell us the same thing. We asked to speak to the manager again and the guy (James) says he's the manager. Not only are they liars but they have ineffective employees that don't know what they're doing. Bad system. I'm also planning on calling corporate, this store sucks!!!</text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80d9523c3ba92779:0x1dd929f2dbdbec4e</gmapID></record>

Ok. Seriously. They were serving soda from 2 liters. 2 LITERS! And the liters were open. If your soda machine is down, it’s down. Don’t serve soda. Period. And by the way, the two liter soda was disgusting. We literally spit it back out and dumped them.</review>

This is the ONLY McDonalds that I have been to in the last 2 months who has been fully stocked. Thank you so much. Thank you for wearing masks and gloves. Thank you for being polite. Thank you for a job well done. This is my favorite place< /Text>

The food taste exactly like it did when I was a kid. The food flavor quality almost the price stays pretty consistent. They’re fast and they will speak to you in English. They have a lot more Pride in their customer service and their product then Jack-in-the-Box absolutely. I think that’s why they’re always packed but they still will get you through quick no matter who you are where you come from or what time is it McDonald’s is hanging in there as an old favorite</review>

By 6:30 and still no food I went up to find out what the deal was, all the sudden they found a big Mac and my food was ready. That was after one of the workers came out to say they had no sweet tea, so they comped a caramel frappe, cool. But then with my order one of the drinks had been replaced by sweet tea, the same tea they said they were out of. Seems like the kids working here are just playing games with customers.</text>< pics>

I don’t leave reviews on chains like Mcdonald’s because it really just is what it is... but this is consistently the worst Mcdonald’s I have ever been to. They’ve been serving pop from 2 liters for probably two months now as their machines have been broken. They’re consistently the slowest in the area which kind of stinks because the only other one near here is on the military base and the staff always has an attitude! LMAO I think I would too if I worked here though. Don’t go here, go somewhere else.<//text>

This place is definitely predominantly populated by men, possibly because of its heavy metal theming, but ladies, don't let that turn you away! The burgers are delicious! I've been here twice and been satisfied both times! First time, I got the napalm death. If you like a little spicy kick, it's a good one! It's very filling, probably with the fried poppers that are included. My second time, I got the Powerslave burger, which seemed not as heavy, but still filling! Come here hungry!< /Text>

Picked up the lettuce from my chicken sandwich and it was dripping brown liquid from it and contained a foul odor 🤮🤢 the lettuce was completely black and obviously old...this is unacceptable and prime example of how customers get sick. Spoke to the manager, Danielle. She didn’t have much to say besides she will report it. She didn’t offer me a refund or a meal replacement. But no worries corporate will be contacted tomorrow morning and I will definitely be paying an in person visit for my money back!< /review>

<text>Worst driver thru order a deluxe breakfast with 2 real eggs and to come back to get the other egg and over priced from other Mc Donalds. 6.29 it's 5.69 at any other store. AVOID AT ALL COST unless you have gas to burn to go back for your order. Also this was at 9:08am there was no rush or line for this mistake.< /text>< Pics>

<text>Friday July 10th, 2020 at 6:55pm

I cannot keep quiet on what I witnessed today during my transaction through the drive-thru.

I saw that the employees were all wearing gloves but touching their hair and each other in the form of a back tap and then they went on to touch the food and surfaces.

I literally saw a female employee fixing her hair bun tightly and then preparing food without changing her gloves. This happened at 6:55pm on July 10th 2020.

I’m sickened by this incident and even more terrified at how about 7 employees were working side-by-side in a cramped space while they all sweated and disregarded changing gloves when touching their hair and each other. Aren’t we in a pandemic?< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<review>I ordered large fries thru drive thru and they were half empty. I got off my car to ask if they can add more and they said yes. They took my same touched container and fries and  tossed them back with the rest of the fries. Mix them around and filled up my container again. Nastiest thing ever. How dare they do that specially in the middle of a  pandemic. Couldn't even eat after that. Just imagining what else they do behind that drive thru wall makes me sick to my stomach. Complained and all they pretty much said was "my bad"< /review></record>

<Review>In the best-case scenario McDonald's is a perfect example of the corporatocracy that has destroyed this country. It wiped out all the mom and pop hamburger stands and replace them with second-rate generic products. It was a happy day when the McDonald's near my near my home in Washington state burned.

Other than breakfast the food is so lame as to be virtually inedible. Half the time this particular McDonald's can't even produce a large cup for their drinks. I quit going to McDonald's 50 years ago because you can't get a burger without gd mustard on it. But I will eat there for breakfast because it's hard to screw up an egg McMuffin in a coffee. This morning I asked him for a sample cup with hot water. Just a little sample cup with some hot water in it. They wanted to charge me for a coffee  I hate this place.</Review>< username>

The place is very busy... I got my order within 5 mins which is nice. It should a 5 stars if the cashier and the manager on duty are smiling and thanking their guest.</Text>

<Text>01/30/2020 1:15pm. They OFTEN forget the condiments. This time they did again,  didn't give me straws for the two unsweetened teas that I ordered "sweet" tea. Fries where old and unsalted.  I live in Chula Vista, I couldn't go back to correct their mistake.  I am HIGHLY upset. This is the worst location to buy from through drive through.<//Text>< Pictures>

I forgot about my post last time, I went inside this time, people got no work ethics at all, we ordered large fries, when I got home, it's large but the amount of fries is a joke. Never going back to this place.

Rude drive thru services. 1900 19January2020. Get rid of that rude person please!!

They don't have work ethics!< /text>

The sandwiches I ordered were typically bleh but affordable. I had to wait an extraordinarily long time and they were not that busy and had plenty of staff. I won't be returning to this location.</Text>

Well being a store manager back in the 80s I always go to McDonald's once in awhile I'm not a fast food guy. My thought on fast food restaurants is it's the people that will serve you quality food so if you get quality food from a certain fast food restaurant they got pretty good people there and McDonald's has always been pretty good< /review>

This McDonald's is not good they dont put freash ingredients I ordered a cheese burger and add extra items like Leaf lettuce and they put shredded lettuce I added tomatoes as well and they put soggy probably old tomatoes it made the whole hamburger horrible I won’t even give it one star I’m actually mad. Honestly I jack in the box is way better. I don’t recommend this McDonald’s! Horrible!</review>

<text>The only thing I like from MC D's is the salad everything else taste the same like your any other typical burger joint it's all the same seasoning it's pretty typical burger patty and cheese but the salad now that packs some flavor from the lettuce dressing to the bacon and small sweet tomatoes<//text>< pictures>

My grandson loves the plaza McDonalds because of play structure.  However, I noticed it's looking rundown.  My grandson cut his foot inside the structure...asked for band-aid, they literally have me ONE small bandaid and cleaning solution.  Noone bothered to come see if he was ok or to inspect the structure.  Also there's a wall outlet thats not only got this disgusting black stuff coming out of it, but it's all loose and falling out. Part of it is black like if it was already a burnt by a short.  That's a serious safety hazard.  Any child can reach it and get electrocuted.  This play place needs a serious tune up, cleaning, etc.<//Text>

I just came to this Mc Donalds and I had a bad service, the cashier’s attitude is just not aprópiate plus she was taking a customer’s order than I was next but instead she walked away to talk to a guy and after 1 min or 2 she came back to help me, I asked for a refill and she didn’t let me know that my drink was ready and so she left it sitting on the counter until I saw and the girl was talking to the same guy again.< /text>

<Review>So I came to this McDonald's tonight because it's close to my house and I really wanted to order an m&m McFlurry and the McDonald's employee that speaks through the intercom on the drive-thru Bryan Morales was really helpful and also made sure my order was correct because I didn't just order the m&m McFlurry I also got the four piece buttermilk chicken tenders a large fry and a sweet tea he then double checked to see if my order was correct which I really appreciate it and then also in for me that my chicken tenders were going to be fresh which I had no problem waiting for. I believe Brian showed really good customer service and if you're looking for good customer service you should stop by this McDonald's and I hope when you order your McDonald's that Brian is going to be at the register taking your order so you can feel my experience.</Review>< resp>

1. No sign before getting into the drive thru saying they only accept cash.

2. After ordering, they told me to pull up to the first window and no one was even there.

3. Pulled up to the second window with no acknowledgement from any crew member.

4. When I finally got my order and got home, which was a 2 minute drive, the fries were a mix of stale and extra stale and seemed like they were trying to mask how stale they really were with the extra salt they added.<//Text>

Bad and rude service on drive thru.  they told me the item I order was not available, (coffee) and have to wait in line of cars until I was able to get out only 2 car in front of me and wait for 20 minutes when I passed the window the young woman that took my order was laughing at me :(.<//review>

Excelent service. I can always come here anytime to eat from the breakfast menu which is really delicious. I do have to mention that lately it's been a very crowded place. I used to come here for quickbites but now it takes almost like 15-20 minutes to receive my order. The place is somewhat small for the amount of people that come everyday. The food is good, but I really think that they should bring back the blueberry pies. They where given around Christmas time in 2015-2016 and I really feel that they should bring back the blueberry pies.<//text>

Service was horrible. She forgot everyone's order including mine I had to come in 3 different times. Different people were coming up in the middle of me ordering saying they were missing fries,tea, and CHICKEN NUGGETS! She then said "Oh yea" and ran off in the middle of me ordering to get their missing food.Mcdonalds you really need to watch who your hiring.</Text>

Not to say much....Its Hot, Slow service, drive thru can't get it right. Restrooms still stink of nastiness and no toilet paper.
I've lived in National City for over 40 yrs. Spoke with the manager Monica without improvement. Seen the same management staff for the last 10 yrs without any service improvement.
Pleaee, new look, even placement from old foundation.....doesn't improve that team of " who give a damn" we are McDonald's....this Unit isn't Owned by Corporate.....so "we will do whatever we choose.<//Review>

This Mcdonalds doesn't even deserve 1 star .1 st my cashier gave me a medium combo even though I clearly said a large combo . Even my daughter agreed that she heard what I ordered and she's only  10. Then when she asked what sauces I wanted with my nuggets I said hot mustard and she gave me honey mustard which I didn't notice till after sitting down to eat ,so I got up to get the right thing and she gave me more honey mustard . So this time my daughter ended up going to get the correct sauce.  It took 3 times just to get it right . I then made a second order thru the kiosk cause my daughter wanted a Mcflurry and I wanted more nuggets so 20 mins had past so I went up to check my order and no one bothered to check or even get my ordered together . So I waited another 5 minutes still no order so I mentioned again that I was waiting for my order still nothing.Then I finally got frustrated and said I wanted my money back and still I was ignored not even a apology for my long wait . This was the worst visit just for a small lunch .And the bathrooms were the worst no freakin toilet paper and no soap to wash your hands , how unsanitary .The worst McDonald's to go to .</text>

Service is slow on the inside. Better to go thru the drive thru where you get faster service. I probably won't go inside anymore. It took 20 minutes just to get 1 ice cream cone and 20 nuggets!!! This place sucks!!!</Review>

Their drive-thru service was down and they did not inform customers ahead of time before getting into line so therefore it took extra extra extra long to place my order.<//review>

Waited in the drive-thru for 45 minutes for one order of tenders. Bad service over all. Wouldn't recommend this place, avoid if possible.
McDonald's in Plaza Boulevard is better.</Review>

My wife and I just got done going through the drive thru we got 2 medium caramel mc cafe with EXTRA CARAMEL and a medium fries. For starters if you charge extra for something and the customer is willing to pay then you should give them extra but in this case no... There was barley any caramel on top or in the cup and second we asked for spicy buffalo sauce and ranch and they gave us one of each. how in the heck are we suppose to enjoy medium fries with 2 sauces!?!? We made the mistake of stopping by this McDonald’s next time we will visit the one down the street in Chula Vista.<//text>

<Review>If I could I will leave it at 0 stars, we went to the drive thru my order was:
*2 promo fries(got a buy one ger one free coupon)
*1 value drink
*2 McDoubles (this weren't added even after we confirmed the order)
*HappyMeal (4pc nuggets)
Total 11.98
....... went to the pickup window that's when I realized the Mcdoubles weren't added, so I ask of I could order them they said yes okay so
*2 Mcdoubles(value menu) for 7.89 😱 I was like "how much for the Mcdoubles? 7.89!! No thanks, why is that much her answer was the best part "We aren't an actual McDonald's we are just a franchise with a private owner there is no control over prices" so my answer was "oh great thank you! I will never come back here"
We don't buy that type of food often maybe once a month but I think the price were kinda odd... still the fact she mentioned the franchise and private thing prices is a big no for me< /Review>< rating>

I always come to this mc donalds. I know it's Christmas day and times vary,  but i just saw two employees laughing and playing around in the back while like five customers were at the door trying to get food. I bet they Locke the door just because.  They were laughing too.<//Review>

Worst Mcdonalds ever! I pre order.  It tells me to let them know at the speaker my order number.  They decide to ignore it. Once i got to the windows i was told to go park.   I asked for ketchup and to my surprise they couldnt even get that right.  Now im 3 mins away from clocking in to work.  Plus 2 min drive.  They literally ruined my lunch today! Super slow.  They dont listen and chose to ignore the customer< /review>

Their food is fine, for the most part,  but their prices have  gotten outrageous, lately. Even if I use their value menu, it costs me about twice as much as  most other  fast food restaurants, to feed my family.<//Text>

<user_id>113560062301017080420< /user_id><review>This is a horrible McDonald's. My husband and I went thru the drive thru at about 1130pm. They were out of Sweet Tea (which is the one of the only reasons I go to Mcdonald's) and they would not sell us a McFlurry. I ordered 7 Double Cheeseburgers 4 without Onions or Pickles a Large Fry and a Medium Fry. When we got home which is no more then 5 minutes away our burgers were so cold. There was pickles on the burgers we ordered with no onions or pickles. And the fries were stale and cold. I called the McDonald's and got no answer. When I called this morning the "Manager" was not very friendly about the situation. Horrible place.<//review>< date>

Everything I come here it's the worst customer service. They always get my order wrong and I tell them no that's not right and they get mad at me. This morning was my last straw I'm never going back this girl yelled at me to move on to next window because I was putting my money away. Oh and yes this was after she messed up my order.<//Text>

<Text>Just because I was Chinese, they thought I didn't know how to speak Spanish so, they were talking and when our food was out, ( took my food for to go ) and when I saw it, I heard one of the employees say, " es para los chinitos que estan ayi " and when I left I was really offended. Overall the food is pretty good, but the employee was just being racist.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

The place has been rebuild and looks modern
But unfortunate the place stinks i spoke to a manager a brought that to her attention
The smell is like a drain or excrement .
It is very unpleasent trying to enjoy your meal and at the same time having that smell in the place.<//Text>

Can't discuss food,  we didn't get any.   Walked in after driving in from west phoenix at 11:15 pm, and were told they were closed and not taking orders. The sign posted said open till 12:00am.  Was to tired and hungry to argue point with young staff,  and left
Wont be back.< /Text>

Very disappointed with the McDonald's on Highland. Waited in line for 8 minutes and by the time we got our food it was cold. Also the McDonald's app keeps going down . This is my second bad experience at this location. Going forward I will  drive a further distance but I will not return to this McDonald's.</Text>

Drive-thru service sucks...takes forever to get your order and then they make you pull up to wait for your food and 5 to 6 cars behind you get their orders...and when they finely come to give your order theirs something missing or wrong....BAD SERVICE....< /text>

Every time I go there it keeps getting worse and worse they need to work on there skills how to treat customer I've been through the drive-thru and after I get my food I  say thank you very much all I get is a sliding glass window  closed in my face I don't think I will being going back there even though it's convenient I rather drive somewhere else and get treated right.<//text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Bad attention compared to the rest of Macdonald's from other Cities. They do not want to follow the same line of service, "because it is from a different owner" Thus, by avoiding the service rules stipulated by the Macdonald's franchise, all service and attention must be the same regardless of whether they are from different owners.

(Original)
Mala atención comparado con el resto de Macdonald's de otras Ciudades. No  quieren seguir la misma línea de servicio, "por que es de diferente propietario" Así heludiendo las reglas de servicio que estipula la franquicia Macdonald's, que todo servicio y atención debe ser por igual sin importar sea de diferentes propietarios.</Text>< pics>
