Ordered two "ICED" Earl Grey Latte. And it was brewed from tea bags for freaking 4 dollars each. The barista has to ask me about how much ice to put in the cup… and the latte is not cold but warm. Not gonna come here again. Will just buy pack of tea bags and brew the tea by myself.< /Review>

<Text>Always a great place to get breakfast or afternoon snack. Great pastries and cake.

During the pandemic they apparently do not serve milk tea. Just a heads up if you are planning on using your coupon (from your receipt) or 5 stars app.

For their cheese cake pastries, I recommend microwave it for ten seconds to make it creamy on the inside.<//Text>< time>

Finally sat down in one of these. The staff was nice and the space was kept clean. They had a large variety of baked goods to choose from and a nice sized menu of teas and coffees. This location was pretty quiet which made it a good spot to study and work.< /Text>

The prices are good. They have in house prepackaged treats. A-la-cart bread, pastries, cakes and coffees.  Loved the red bean pastry, it was perfectly cooked and delicious.</Review>

<review>Sometimes they don't have a lot of inventory as far as selection.  Very recently I noticed when walking in the selection isn't as good as it was before.  That said, I do come here quite often because when they have what I want (the prime rib sandwich is awesome) the food quality is really amazing!  Minor nit pick with the selection but I guess that just might be on days they don't expect to be as busy and they want the food as fresh as possible which could explain why it seems so empty when I go there sometimes.</review></record></dataset><record>

Their matcha roll cakes are pretty good, lightly sweet, firm but fluffy, and perfectly suitable for people who are sensitive to sweets.

As for the bread, I can't help but be disappointed. There's rarely anything here that's bad, but nothing so amazing or notable that I would come only here for it. 85C and Paris Baguette have their established niche, but Tous Les Jours doesn't quite have a strong impression yet.<//Text>

This place is a not bad Korean bakery and their offering is very similar to the famous Korean chain bakery store paris baguette. The bread and cakes do look pretty but I feel they can work on the cleaning of the store. The table is very sticky during my visit and there is no water in the water bottle.. I took one star off due to this.</review>

It look a long time to get one then I had to wait another 10 minutes for another.  There weren't may customers.  Then, I went to buy pastries.  I bought around 20 items.  The worker was eating a triangle sushi at the register.  I thought it was totally inappropriate but I let it go.  She put down a half eaten sushi to help her co-worker with the register.  I asked a question - did you get the 6 red bean items?  when I turned to look at her, she was rolling her eyes at me and appeared irritated.  Although I felt like just walking out without buying, I was buying the pastries for my elderly mom's friend.  I don't usually write these kinds of posts but I just thought for an upscale bakery, they really need to hire well and train well.  I will never go here again and I don't recommend this place for anyone who is looking for a good experience.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) The environment is very elegant, and the display of bread and cakes is also very appetizing. The color of macarons is as beautiful as a gradient blush, not very sweet, but the taste is generally not too crispy, rasberry is sour, and grapefruit tastes like orange. However, tiramisu is really good. It feels like cheesecake when the spoon is dug down, but the entrance is like Dove with a silky texture. So many layers are combined but they complement each other. It feels like sitting in a small courtyard with black tea. It's really a treat

(Original)
环境很优雅，面包蛋糕的摆放也让人很有食欲。马卡龙的颜色美得像渐变腮红，不是很甜，不过味道感觉一般般皮不太脆，rasberry偏酸，grapefruit像橙子的味道。但是，提拉米苏是真的棒，勺子挖下去像芝士蛋糕的触感，可是入口像德芙有种丝滑的口感，这么多层合在一起却种相得益彰，感觉配上红茶坐在小庭院里真是一种享受<//Review>

<Text>Yesterday, My family and I were hungry so we went to Pizza Hut for dinner. It was a good experience overall because I go there with my friends and family on multiple occasions. When we sat down they scrubbed the tables for us so we wouldn't get sick. They have great service too when they asked us if we wanted anything else to go with our food. The pizza was great it was not too cheesy and the crust wasn't too greasy either. Their food is not too expensive and it is not too cheap either so they have good prices. When we got a 2 liter soda we actually got to keep the drink. After we ate we cleaned our hands with napkins they gave us and got a box to take home the leftovers. It was a great experience overall and I would want to come back again.<//Text>< Pictures>

The "contactless" delivery went about without a hitch, the order was placed in the area in my vehicle that I requested, and I was kindly thanked for my patronage.</review>

The sauce was tasteless at this location. No love went into the making of these pizzas. Saw employees mucking about instead of handing me my order, I think only one of them is carrying the whole team.<//text>

<Review>My delivery order was wrong! I called the store and the girl on the phone was extremely rude about it.  I asked her to speak to the manager and she said she was the manager “Daniela Hernandez” but I doubt it.  I dont think a manager would talk to a customer like that.< /Review>< Rating>

Horrible, didn’t get my order because the driver went to the wrong house we waited in front of the door and he lied, never ordering from this place again. Shouldn’t even give them a star at all<//Text>

Went in and asked for the specials, girl gave me some while I was Googling then I asked large 2 toppings for 7.99 she responded only online order I checked....that was true. So I continued to order the $5 picks she said (only online).....not true and she went on with I'm sorry it's not that I don't want to take your order which it started to look like she didn't o I went outside placed my  order online 2 large 2 toppings 2 medium 1 topping and a pasta total after tax $35 and change she gave me 1 large 3 medium and my pasta I'm still waiting for my credit.  4 days and counting it usually takes 7 to 10 business days but she didn't give me a receipt for my credit and I didn't want to wait 20 minutes more for my pizza.

Gave Stars because I love Pizza Hut would have gave it 1.< /Review>

< review>
Just ordered five large pizzas for my team.  We're 9/10s of a mile from the Pizza Hut and the pizzas arrived 20 minutes late; they were lukewarm; and all five were hand-tossed although we ordered two of them as pan pizzas.

The new pizzas with the expanded item list and free flavor drizzles were pretty good (other than being cold) although the different crust flavors were rather difficult to taste.</review>

Their gud i guess .... Today was the 1st time ever that they gave me the wrong 🍕 pizza. The cashiers are nice and respectful... The cooks... Need to speed up their game in getting orders out in a timely manner. I ordered on line and went in 10 minutes after the time they said my order would be ready and it wasn't..i waited 15 additional minutes...this was alright with me...but when i got home...i was upset becuz i got a cheese pizza whrn i paid for a surpreme< /Review>

I waited over an hour for 1 pizza from this place. They have me store credit but they couldn't even drop off the pizza. Never ordering from this unreliable dump place again. I wish I could give it 0 stars.<//review>

Horrible service, I place a order online and then they turned around and canceled it on me. No one attempted to even get a hold of me, not by the driver or store. I like pizza hut, but no so much that I am willing to put up with the service that this location continues to provide. Choosing Dominoes better.</Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) I really am very disappointed in this place true if Before there was a lot of kindness the pizza was very well made but nowadays I do not have the same opinion the manayer is a rude nowadays I spoke to make a claim so that they will improve the service for the community that she is going to buy pizza but she behaved very rude and said that she does not have 10 minutes to talk nonsense about people and that if she was not going to buy pizza that was not taking away her time, I want you to take into account all this and If you can not go back and buy that Pizza lately they do not do it as you ask. I've been a customer for years and I'm very disappointed. I really want everyone who wants to go there to buy a pizza, because they are so rude. and they treat you badly When you make a claim They think you're dying of hunger and that's why you want to order something else that you already ate when your pizza that they sold to me is useless and be careful I wish you luck and you do a pizza well because I would not recommend it would really recommend that they remove that pizzeria and removed the staff they removed they put a more friendly and more attentive staff Okay I hope it serves you something my opinion Bye that happen a good day

Realmente estoy muy desilusionada de este lugar cierto si Antes había mucha amabilidad estaba muy bien hecha la pizza pero hoy en día no tengo la misma opinión la manayer es una grosera hoy en día hablé para hacer un reclamo para que mejorarán el servicio por la comunidad que va a comprar pizza pero se portó muy grosera y dijo que ya no tiene 10 minutos para hoir  tonterías de la gente y que si no iba a comprar pizza que mejor no le estuviera quitando su tiempo quiero que por favor tomen en cuenta todo esto y que si se puede no vuelvan a comprar ahí esa Pizza Últimamente no la hacen como se las pides Yo he sido cliente de años de ahí y estoy muy desilusionada realmente quiero que todo el que quiera ir ahí a comprar una pizza no lo haga porque son muy groseros y te tratan mal Cuando haces un reclamo Creen que uno se está muriendo de hambre y que por eso uno quiere pedir algo de más que ya se comió cuando sus pizza que me vendieron a mi no sirve para nada tengan cuidado y les deseo suerte que ustedes y les hagan bien una pizza porque a mí no no la recomendaría realmente recomendaría que quitaran esa pizzería y quitaron el personal lo removieron pusieran un personal más amable y más atento Okay Espero que le sirva de algo mi opinión Bye que pasen un buen día<//review>< user_name>

I like beer. His beer set up is nice. He rotates beers as not to get bored. Grab a glass of Martzen its my favorite. Sweet, crisp, with a red hue, very refreshing.</Text>

< review>
I really wanted to like this place. I have been wanting to try this place for weeks now. It was suggested to me by Yelp. I love beer and skewers so it's a no-brainer that I would like this place, so I thought. Poor beer selection - they only carry 7 JP Das Brew beers, the beef and lamb skewers were chewy and the dumpling were below average. Nothing bad to say about the staff but probably wont go back based on the food and drinks.</review>

The food was ok but the dry rub wasn't good. I also don't like how there's no combo options and everything has to be bought a la carte. Also, the shrimp skewer features whole head on shrimp with the shell still on...😕Probably won't be back 👋🏽</Text>

Garlic fries were excellent!  Much better than Flames on 4th St, and also better than City Fish.  But not as good as Gordon Biersch was before they moved away.

With the continuing surge in alternative restaurant options luring people away from downtown (the new eateries in Japantown to the north, the new microbreweries open in the south, all the new San Jose State University food court expansions to the east, and the new Whole Foods cluster of eateries on the Alameda to the west) more lower-end eateries downtown are closing, and more upscale restaurants are coming in, to cater to the people in the new hotel expansions and all the new condo towers that keep popping up.

It is against this backdrop that my menu items were found to be wanting: For example, the lamb skewer was only $2.50. But though the tongue finds the lamb to be awesome, the stomach declares the hunger hasn't subsided enough. One of the possible ways to address this might be to up the $2.50 price to $3.75, and add a mini-potato and/or other root vegetable onto the skewer, to increase the feeling of fullness.

Because parking is such a hassle downtown, patrons will often have to walk past other bars and restaurants to get to the one they want. The garlic fries are great, but IMO, could use a bit more of a tweak, to turn it into a culinary version of a "killer app."  See photo:

To be fair, this might be more of a place to drink and eat, than just to eat. But I haven't drank enough to know beer.<//text>< Rating>

Few but great beer options, and very solid skewers. Plus a gigantic and *very* good chili fries.  Definitely worth a repeat visit, everything was better than anticipated.

Somewhat rare and a huge +1: skewers are small and cheap so you can explore easily, or try *all* of them even with a small group.<//Review>

A few interesting beers on draft, and a few interesting items roasted on skewers. Each skewer about $2.45 for about 2 oz of produce. It was just what we wanted. We will go again.</Review>

<Text>Didn't appear to have a large selection of beers but still a decent amount. The food is reasonably priced. The skewers are priced per skewer so it's easy to get exactly what you want. Not a lot on each skewer though.<//Text><Time>1554622002276</Time><Name>Nick Ramirez< /Name>< Rating>

<Review>The staff and ownership are very personable people.  The had a wide array of beers that were reasonably priced, and the skewers were on point....not to mention served pretty quickly.  I definitely will be returning often, and with others.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Sorry really wanted to like this place, but had to wait an hour for the skewered meats because they ran out of food. Owners clearly doesn’t know anything about craft beer either and only carries JP Das Brew because they gave them the cheapest beer prices. I will give them a year before they close or sell.</Text>

< review>
I have eaten here before and the food was decent, not the best Indian food I have had but by far not the worst. Decent prices and portion sizes. However this time around, my experience was much worse. The food was scheduled for pick up at 1:00pm, and the restaurant did not confirm my order until 2:15pm. I understand that they were busy, but I did not know whether or not my order was received. When I went to pick the order up, the employee said that my order was canceled by Door Dash (it was not), even though I had received a message from Door Dash that the order was ready for pick up. After leaving without my order, and after a pretty rude encounter with the worker, I contacted Door Dash to ask why the order was canceled, upon which they said it was not. Ultimately, I did not get a refund from the restaurant, and was on the phone with Door Dash for 45 minutes trying to resolve the issue. My order was finally refunded, and it was determined that Naan Stop had canceled my order without telling me. Overall a very bad customer service experience, and will not be returning.< /review>

Absolutely love the guy who works here!!! I would argue that this is the best spot in IV. The first time that I went, I had a great convo with the boss (I’m guessing he is?) and he kept giving me and my friends samples and big portions of food. Came back again today to buy some boba for my roommate that graduated. We had a good conversation and have gave us two free bowls as a congratulations!! Support this business as much as possible! The thai tea boba is amazing and his food is the first authentic Indian food I’ve ever had! :) Thank you! <3< /Text>

Their Naan Stop and Sorbet is amazing! My kids loved the teddy bears & I got the piggies. Next time we're getting the bunnies and chickens in a cup! So cute, we'll be going back soon. Oh, they will also do a dog (cup only) and Pikachu.<//text>

The food tastes like home... if my parents were Indian. They toast the naan on the spot for you. The cheese naan I got had melty cheese inside. The chicken tikka masala and the coconut sauce were great.<//Text>

The Chicken Masala was fantastic, and paired great with their garlic naan. My opinion is a bit biased because I love Indian food, but overall a very charming little restaurant.

Sami is usually running the register and is a very warm guy. His suggestions are fantastic if you don't know what you want.</review>

I ordered the chicken tikka masala rice bowl. It wasn't creamy or sweet enough, but it was a good deal for the price. They also sell boba tea here, although I didn't try it. The naan was too oily. Unfortunately, this is the only Indian restaurant nearby.<//text>

Had an opportunity to pick some up today for the first time in a very long time, and I must say that it is just as good as I remember. And now I feel like I have been neglecting this IV gem. One of the last of the old, long running restaurants. I truly hope that the gentrification of Isla Vista won't make Naan Stop go.  I have loved every dish I've tried here.<//Review>< Pictures>

I used to love this place. Recently they changed their prices so that, instead of getting a better deal on larger orders, large to go containers cost disproportionately more than their smaller counterparts.

8oz Chicken is 5.75
12oz Chicken is 9.75
The difference in volume is 150%
The difference in price is 170%
Then they charge an extra dollar if you want Chicken Tikka Masala!

They clearly changed their pricing to a more predatory model to take advantage of drunk college students. This is a sad cash grab from a great restaurant. I cannot recommend this place anymore. If you want to get a delicious Indian feast, go to Masala Spice.</text>

The hospitality here was great when we went. The food had naan stop flavor! So delicious and affordable. Great spot for vegitarians as it has many options to pick from so that you can enjoy your meal now and still come back later to try other new options and combinations. They provided samples and helpful information in case one has allergies or preference. I highly recommend trying this place. I look forward to coming back and trying more of their foods.<//Text>

We ordered 3 different entree which cost us $50. When we got it, it didn't come with rice or anything. I called the restaurant 3 times asking them why I didn't get rice and the guy rudely said that's just how it is and hung up on me. The lamb was over cooked and it tasted as if it was previously frozen and heated as if it's newly cooked. I absolutely question all the good reviews here. Giving this place 1 star is VERY generous.</review>

The Indian food here is very delicious. The boba is ok, but I don't think that many boba places here can compare to ones in big cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, or New York. I recommend the chicken tikka masala. It is quite delicious.< /Text>

This service come really fast so they can serve you with food constantly and get you in and out. I think this is predominantly a Gujarati based Thali, so you can expect A lot of the curries & dals to be sweet.< /Review>

Both hubby and I got a plate dinner :consisted of 1 chicken & 1 vegetable + rice  for $9.95 ,enough to feed you. We chose the popular chicken dish and the "creme spinach/tofu -both tasty with true Indian flavors.

I had an almond milk tea, sweet, very almond flavor, I like it and could have Boba too added, if you wanted. It seem too sweet for hubby and daughter.

The sweet cheese ball dessert was ok, I had better but could be, it was late in the day, seem overly soggy.<//review>

It's not expensive and it's suuuuper good. The basic bowl with rice and chicken and any naan variation will make you feel super full even if you are not done yet.<//Text>

<text>Think Panda Express, but for Indian food.  They have trays of pre-made food and serve straight from them.   It's not gourmet, but I think it tastes pretty good, and it's not absurdly expensive!   I like the chicken tikka masala, but the veggie options are good, too!  If you don't mind paying an extra couple dollars, I'd recommend also getting either a samosa or warm naan.

A word of caution.  There are several menus in the store, so it's a little confusing to order.  I (and the people working there) recommend you just pick something from the blackboard next to the food trays.  I always just get a rice bowl.  Simple and cheaper than most other options!

Something I don't like about this place is the use of plastic and styrofoam bowls and utensils.  Something to keep in mind if you're bothered by using disposable things.<//text>< Pics>

A fast food version of the standard Indian lunch buffets, you can order complicated meals, or more commonly you can grab a 1 item bowl or 2 item plate. All the standards are here, Chicken Tikka Masala, Vegetable Korma, Chicken Vindaloo, Chana Masala, Saag Paneer, etc. They do variaties of naan that are good and fresh, and the owner who frequently works the register is very nice.
You can eat in, they have a sauce stand for the mint chutney, etc you may want, and some cramped seating for those stopping in for a quick lunch. There's a small shared parking lot as well, making it convenient for lunch even if you have to drive in from outside Isla Vista. Alternatively they do take out, providing separate sauce and rice containers to make it easier to transport, and have both GrubHub and DoorDash.
The prices are very good, it's slightly on the less expensive side for a lunch in the IV area.<//text>

Be sure to check out the larger menu, can get custom curries, samosa, dahls, etc. Buffet is inexpensive, full menu a bit pricier, but worth it. Small dining space, but happy takeout. Beware driving in IV as students wander streets as if cluless to vehicles, especially watch out for random foolish bicycles expecting world to watch out for blind entrance on busy streets.</Text>< GmapID>

I go here pretty often for dinner after late classes. It scratches an inch for indian food that nowhere else in IV really hits. The Tikki Masala is probably my favorite.</review>

I am actually obsessed with this place! Their samosas are so delicious, very flaky on the outside and moist on the inside. I love the new veggie korma they have begun serving. I wish they would bring back the vegetable rice, but I have truly enjoyed every meal I've ever had there! I love the clever name and I am stoked about the boba tea - especially the Taro! SO good! love naan stop</text>

A great indian place to get food quick. I come frequently and I can't leave the place without also getting a vegetable samosa. I sometimes come for the chicken curry and other times I find myself getting tikka masala. There is never much of a wait and the seats are fine but I prefer to get it to go.<//review>

They use only styrofoam containers to serve all their food in, even if you eat it there. This concerns me because it is so much plastic waste that is not recyclable and harms our local ocean and wildlife. I would consider going there if they changed their containers and eating ware. Please change your styrofoam! Something that is bioregradable,  environmentally friendly or reusable!< /review>

Soggy naan. Small portions. Food is heated up from frozen. And fyi the entrees don't come with rice. Anyone saying this is good probably just has never had good Indian food. I gave this place two disappointing tries. Stay away.</text>

This is one of my favorite indian restaurants in the Santa Barbara area for ordering a Chicken Tiki Masala bowl and a Mango Snow Bubble with Boba drink. However, I only go there when the UCSB students are on either school breaks or summer vacation because parking is impossible otherwise.<//text>

<Text>Fun pun alert! This place is awesome. If you're looking for something warm and cozy, vegetable korma and daal makhne are where it's at. Chicken tikka also great. If he's got lamb that going that day, you're welcome. The owner dude who is always up front is super rad too. He is always saying 'no regrets' ....you're darn right ;) Treat yourself and get a side of bread. It's so hot and just makes everything better.</Text>< Time>

A great deal, lots of food for a reasonable price. It only got hotter with time as the spicy chicken marinated in the curry. Most of the bad reviews seem to be for Boba, and service. I havent had boba here in a while so I cant speak to that but the guy working behind the counter couldn't have been more friendly or helpful.< /Text>

When you walk in, stay to the right; this is where you will find the menu on the wall and order.  I see people walking up to the register and trying to order, the setup isn't 100% intuitive but that's fine. To be honest, I did the same thing, but I figured it out while waiting for the register guy to ring someone else up. The customer service was good. I chatted briefly with the dude at the register. The two people running the front seemed nice.

I ordered food from here a few days ago. It was amazing. It reminded me of another Indian food place in Los Angeles. Imo the place is a two $$, but for this area it's a single $. After being deprived of food for so long, this really filled me up nicely.

The Earl Grey boba is not worth getting though; it's a real shame because Earl Grey done right can be a really outstanding choice for milk tea boba. The boba was cooked correctly, it wasn't raw nor was it overly soft and falling apart in the straw.

The biggest bonus I would give this place is that they have a cute girl working there ^_^ (They would get 4 stars regardless of her being there or not)< /Text>

Small room and not that much of a selection but the food is the best ever since Taja Malha and Indian Club closed. I absolutely love the Chicken Tikka Masala. The milk tea is also the best by far that I've ever tasted around here. It's not overly sweet like the other places that I've been to which is nice. It's also quite affordable which is a major bonus since I love Indian.< /review>

Great Tikka Masala, Dal Makhani and Saag Paneer.

<text>This is my go-to for Indian food. I wouldn't call it amazing, but it's very tasty, pretty fast, and SO cheap. I always get the chicken tikka masala with plain naan and rice. Don't forget to try out their sauces! The green sauce is really tasty: mint and cilantro team up for amazingness.< /text><rating>4<//rating>< user_id>

Ordered a simple breakfast burrito, waited 30+ minutes for it while watching people who ordered after me get their multiple orders. Opened the foil to my "burrito" (it was squished) and the burrito which they cut in half was falling completely apart.  Was pretty disappointed in my visit and wouldn't recommend. :(<//Review>

One of my favorite delis because they have lots of gluten-free items. If you are on a gluten-free diet this is the place for you. They have gluten-free cinnamon rolls that are delicious.</Review>

<Text>We have gotten countless breakfast burritos here. I used to love pre-ordering and pickup on my way out of town. But several months ago I ordered a veggie burrito they gave me a fully loaded MEAT burrito and it was disgusting biting into that. Threw it away and was already on my way and pressed for time, I couldn’t go back even though I was now hungry and missing my breakfast. Frustrated, I called the Deli. They said no worries, we will comp your next burrito. So I went back to redeem about a month later and they didn’t have record and made me wait 30 minutes while they called the manager and the manager had to call the person on staff the day my order got messed up, and then they still wanted to charge me extra for choosing a different burrito that costed a dollar or so more. I found this whole situation frustrating, hence me taking off a few stars. They are expensive but I’m willing to pay the price for a good breakfast burrito, but not if they treat customers like this. I emailed the company many months ago with no response. My husband keeps wanting to go back but I say no way. I like supporting local businesses, but only when their customer care is a positive experience.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<review>I like to think of myself as a connoisseur of breakfast burritos.... a burrito bravura if you will... and i have to say that this burrito far exceeded my burrito expectations. Almost makes me sad that my digestion processes will only allow me to retain this deliciousness for 6-12 hours before expulsion. The pickles are the size of enormous cucumbers and the fishy fish tank provides hours of entertainment. 6/5 stars<//review>< gmapID>

The place is really cute and based on the reviews, we thought we'd get some really great food. I had the potato soup, which costs $10, and it was rancid. They gave me a refund, but the sheer fact that a bowl of soup even costs that much in the first place is ridiculous. I expected it to be some seriously gourmet potato soup, and it was absolutely disgusting. The staff tried it too and agreed with me. The staff themselves were great, but I just can't see myself going there again after this experience.< /text>

It was my first time there. I very much enjoyed it. Very friendly people, good menu variety, build your own sandwiches, icecream...and all day breakfast. I had an awesome BLT with avocado. You can eat inside or outside among the redwoods on picnic tables. You can even bring your dog. Very nice quiet setting.<//review>

<review>I told the cashier I'd never been here before and she explained how to order at the food counter and then do your other shopping and then pay at the counter near the door. She was really nice. I said the Tuesday special sounded good and she said it IS sooo good, so I ordered it (and a brewed coffee). She was right. 10/10< /review>< Resp>

<text>Even though I was willing to pay for the whole egg... their "policy" prevented them from separating the yolks from the whites for me (siting cost effectiveness).

Pricey but huge breakfast burritos. Easily enough for breakfast and lunch. Coffee is usually very good but a few times it's been too weak. Great alternative if the other nearby coffee joint is too busy. Friendly staff and lots of very good fresh food. Their sandwiches are excellent.<//Text>

<Review>Great lunch spot for your sandwich cravings. They have a coffee bar, serve gelato, smoothies, and have decent snacks and drinks, including local wine by the bottle for take away. Everything is pretty delicious and satisfying. It is a little on the pricy side, the  staff are friendly (they are all pretty young, like highschool/early college age), the service can be slow sometimes, but it's a very popular lunch spot for the nearby businesses and school kids.<//Review>< name>

< review>
Their sandwiches are a little pricey and have had better elsewhere however they make great smoothies and will go back for those for sure. Cute out of the way with patio and small seating area inside. Nice aquarium with big colorful fish. Next time want to try their breakfast...looks delish.< /review>

Love the Palm Deli!  Food is super tasty.  They always have interesting salads and sides.  It's not inexpensive but it's worth what you pay.< /review>

Delicious sandwiches and salads! Slower service means I don't go as often, but we go on days when we don't have a timeline.</Review>

<Text>After waiting for the server to take two calls while standing there for 5 mins listening to him get the orders straight he finally asked me for my order. Im of the old school thinking that a customer in the store is more important than one on the phone. Instead of me holding when im there first surely you can ask the call to hold. Maybe im just hangry.<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>i bought 2 Acai fruit bowls and they where frozen solid and  hardly had any fruit t all, if i wanted a half microwaved frozen fruit bowl with a half banana 2 strawberries and a blueberry i would have stayed at home, waited extra long for it and just realized it was stuck in a microwave, and the guys working there are  obviously not trained at all in  making food, and customer care, the girls are a little more friendly, but after today im not going back, sorry microwaves mean lazy nasty food to me!</Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

The customer service was awful. I went with husband and she told us to stand 6ft apart. Really!!! We just came together in freaking car and she wants us to stand apart yet the rest of the men are in groups and it's ok. Whatever! Over all like going there just train the woman to be more polite to the customers.</review>

Reclaimed my laptop after my mom passed. It was in pretty rough shape. Ron pulled off a miracle and got it running like new again! Even updated windows for me while he was at it. Fast, thorough, professional and kind. Definitely will be recommending him to family and friends. Thanks Ron!<//text>

Fast and efficient. I had my laptop back the next day fully repaired. The man works out of his home so a phone call prior to arriving there setting up an appointment will be necessary but at $125 at least my laptop is clean and functional again.</Text>

Woke up one day to start my daily routine, and lo-and-behold, my laptop decided to commit suicide. Just like that, my day was off to an awful start. So, I took my my laptop to PC Fix and within 24 hrs I had my laptop back and I was happy again. lol. I was kept updated throughout the repair process and the price was perfect!
HIGHLY RECOMMEND PC Fix!!!<//review>

Ron is great! Over the phone I told him how my laptop had been acting. He knew exactly what was wrong with it. He works out of his home (THE ADDRESS IS REAL) I dropped my laptop off to him and he called me to pick it up literally 4hrs later. My laptop is working like new. I highly recommend PC Fix😎</text>

I needed a battery replaced on my computer ASAP and this guy definitely beat Geek Squad. I just called his number and he was able to take my computer in same day. He fixed my problem within an hour though your time may vary depending on what you need done. Great communication for a decent price!</Review>

Ron is very knowledgeable in his field as well as transparent about what should be done to a laptop or computer. His prices are heaven sent compared to his competitors. My laptop was fixed in under 15mins due to a battery issue. I recommend contacting this business for any pc issues before being charged too much by someone else.</review>

< Review>
I called PC Fix because I needed a new desktop set up. We couldn't figure it out. Ron came out the very next day. He was super nice and explained things as he set it up. His price was more than reasonable. I am super happy, and I highly recommend him to ANYONE needing computer help. I am super impressed! I know who I will be calling if I have any computer needs in the future!</Review>

Ron was incredible. He set our family desktop computer up with Windows 10 quickly and efficiently. He made a prompt house call to do so (My dad was frustrated with not being able to get an appointment at our usual big Retailer for 2 weeks. He did a search for computer repair and decided to give PC Fix a chance. My dad called Ron late in the afternoon and he was at our house the next day).

He set up our router improving service to all our devices. He even took a look at and ran diagnostics on my personal laptop which was not part of the visit.  PC Fix was convenient, affordable, and an incredible value. I highly recommend their services.<//Text>

Great service, quick response. My surface pro was smoking when I plugged it in, brought to Ron and he was honest, suggested I start with a new charger. Wellah, problem solved! Saved 100s of $$.

Thanks Ron!!!<//review>

Ron is AWESOME! He was able to fit in between appointments, and he was so upfront and honest about what he can and can't do. I took my laptop to him because I couldn't get it to charge, and he tried everything he could before having to open it up and charge me for it. Luckily he did, because its just a bad charger(so I just ordered one). And he didn't charge me for a diagnostic either. Ron, THANK YOU SO MUCH! You've saved me alot of money. I will be back if anything else happens, and Im definitely recommending to everyone I know. 😁< /review>

<review>Ron is always so helpful. I’ve taken my computer to him several times and have called him up so stressful cuz I want to just throw my computer out the window. He’s walked me through things and has fixed my problem(s) accurately and professionally and quickly every time. Local and Small Business is the way to go.

< review>
I was initially skeptical about trying PC FIX because it is a residence and I am used to the Geek Squad's "support", but I gave it a try because we were desperate to get the PC I just built looked at. I contacted PC FIX and he told me he does not usually look at custom builds but that he would make an exception to see if he could help. Long story short, if it was not for PC FIX I would have sent all my parts back thinking they were defective. Thanks again PC FIX!< /review>

Quick, responsive and diligent. He was very reasonably priced and highly informative as he fixed my issue. I will go to him for all my IT needs in the future!
Just recently had another computer issue and he once again like clockwork was fast on the response and fixed my problem in less than 3 days. Had to wait for part to come in. You can beat the prices and the quality of work he delivers. Very happy that I didn't have to ditch my my computer.<//Review>

<date>1543379070513</date><Rating>1<//Rating><text>I ended up having a rare experience. It had began well, as stated previously in my 4 star review. Then, for whatever reason.. after leaving that review I had received a text message asking me to "revise the review, -he spent several hours on it." I appreciate the heck out of people who do good work and are generally respectful, but that threw me off... After days of trying to catch him when he was available; he had the nerve to blame me for him cancelling an appointment and then requested $75. In conclusion, I disagree with his tact, level of respect and scheduling abilities. I understand that everyone has their own experiences.. It's a shame that mine was like this.</text>< pictures>

PC Fix quickly solved my problem right over the phone.  Saved me lots of grief and time.  He could have gouged me and I would have paid it because I was so happy to get my email fixed, but instead was very reasonable.  I will definitely use him again!</review>

After a few high-priced diagnostic fees and one guy saying it just wasn't possible for a "recessed" keyboard, he stumbled onto Ron, owner of PC Fix.
I can't say enough good things about our experience. He was quick, reasonable and kept us updated (by text) every step of the way! So glad we now have a place for all our PC needs!!! :)</review>< Rating>

<review>Great place to buy tires. Great prices, great service, and great quality. The management is on it, the employees are on it. I have been shopping here for years and never a complaint. Large area to hang out in while you wait. Also the location is easy with plenty of parking. Highly recommend going here for your tire needs!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>I hit something in our Tesla and saw this place off the freeway.  The guys were so professional, they checked for damage under our car, even pushed a portion of the side back in and found the nail in our tire, all in under an hour and all for under $30 bucks.  I was so relieved they were an honest crew.  They did not try to up sell me or persuade me to purchase a whole new tire.  I was so pleasantly surprised.and people will always write a complaint but I wanted to make sure I did not miss an opportunity to say they were fair.</review>< Pictures>

<Text>Yesterday I got tire pressure warning on my dashboard. 3 tires were OK and one was triggering the warning. This morning I used gauge to check pressure on all tires and realized that all were low with one triggering the warning being the lowest. Then I visually inspected that tire and found nail/screw sticking out from the tire. Quick search on internet – found close by Tire's Warehouse already open at about 7:30 AM.
These gays amazing. Car was immediately inspected with diagnose
“ nothing to wary – just short nail did not cause any damage to tire”
I was ready for the worse including lost day at work.
They could easily push me to buying new tire because that nail was very close to edge of the tire.
Thanks Tire Warehouse – you just go yourself new very happy customer.

< review>
I have been going there for the 8 years. Good service but if you try to claim your tires "beware". Purchased a set of 4 that was suppose to last 65,000. They only lasted 19,000 and when I went to get a warranty they said "we don't cover claims". They will sell but not cover the products they sell. Will go to Costco down the street from now on as when I mentioned they would pro rate the tires they sell the Sales guy said "Yea....we don't do that". Ask before buying......but then they may not tell you that at all.

*** Just confirmed that they will NOT cover any tire for mileage! Just defect within the first year. Go somewhere else if you want that type of customer service as other DO offer it.</review>

<review>Needed tires for my car.
Walked in, guy behind the desk finally said "whaddya need"?
Almost told him "someone who gives a rat's ass about their customers", but instead I said "new tires for my car and a ride to work about a mile down the road."
He replied, "that ain't gonna happen".
I said, "neither is my purchase of your junk tires, adios"
If anyone ever asks me about Tire's Warehouse, I'll tell them to keep on going to America's Tire on Brookhurst and Warner.
They treated me like a real person, and were happy to give me a ride and pick me up when they were done. Now THAT'S customer service!<//review>< Pictures>

This place is dirty. The bathroom has no soap. The sanitiser dispenser is empty. The cashier does not know how to smile. The only good thing is the price.<//text>

Very nice people. New place to buy my drinks!!! Came here late night with my girls and there was a suspicious guy outside. Once the employee (probably the owner) saw us park, he came out and walked us in. Good priced drinks and good deal on White Claw Packs! Once we got out he watched us get into the car and made sure we left safely. Our new favorite place to get our drinks! SIR, IF YOU'RE READING THIS, WE APPRECIATE YOU! :)</Text>

The person bringing the food out was good.
The order was incorrect and I didn't have time for it to be corrected.  I asked for mustard to be in packets and cheese melted on the hot dogs.  Mustard was caked on the buns.  The cheese was put separate on a piece of paper and stuck to it.  And they did give me mustard packets.  I had to toss the bun away.  The soda was good.  The fries were only warm.  The water was also good.  The person was told twice about the mustard and repeated the order to me on the intercom.  Odd how the preparation was so awful.  Usually it's real good at this Sonic.</Text>

Every few times I've have come to Sonic's it's a good experience. The employee's perform their duties well. The food overall is good american food who doesn't like that. The shakes and blizzards are best part of going to this location. It is a 15 mile drive for me but it's worth it since you can park and eat hey maybe play a movie in your vehicle while eating.</Review>

The shakes are delicious and definitely worth the buy. However I tried the chicken tender dinner and it wasn't that good though. Recommend you eat literally anything other than that one item. Overall pretty good.<//review>

It's like food at Disneyland or Great America. The drive thru is often packed and how it's laid out is a little cramped but overall this is a great place we go to to get our junk food fix.</text>< pictures>

<Review>I honestly only come here for the drive lol.
The drive in parking is tight! You can see people have hit the poles on the way in or out of the drive in. Other than that their pretzel dogs are good wings are good, tater tots are good so far everything I've tried there was good. I'll give them a 8/10 because I'm one of the people that scuffed my car in their tight drive in 🤦‍♂️<//Review>< Date>

<Text>Sonic is fun because you can drive up and order your food in stalls. Then you can eat it there. There strawberry slush is amazing. You can make so many different types of shakes. They have happy hour for half price drinks an slush in the afternoon and during the summer at night they have half priced shakes.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>I didn't really know Sonic is more of a shakes-and-desserts only place (aside from the side options), so I was disappointed when I found out that there are no proper vegan food options apart from onion rings and a grilled cheese sandwich. Still, the hot fudge sundae I decided to try out was nice - the standard, nothing special. I didn't understand the hype. I also got some nutella-filled pretzel things (the exact name escapes me). Overall, it's nothing I would keep in my mind the next time I want to curb a sweet tooth, but it's not the worst place for a bit of a fast food snack run full of random eateries. The worker who handed us our food was very friendly and helpful, so kudos to her!

Update: I added one more star, because the business read and replied to my review, which shows attention to detail.< /text><username>Aliza Siddiqui<//username><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1599073099557, 'text': 'Hi Aliza, we are sorry to disappoint you and appreciate you letting us know.'}< /response></record></dataset><record>

I love the drinks at Sonic. Sift serve mixed with ur favorite flavors makes any day better. If ur in the area between 2pm and 4pm make sure 2 stop by 4 happy hour. Most of the drinks half priced. Wat beats getting sonic grape slush wasted 4 half price. Enjoy!<//Review>

<Text>Sonic was so good for many reasons. first I love the fact that you can park your car and you basically dont have to get out if you don't want to. They have the menu right there and you can take your time looking at all the food and drink items. Then you push the button when you're ready to order.  We never felt rushed. We ordered a hot dog, double bacon cheeseburger vanilla shake onion rings pretzel limeade and tater tots. Which were seasoned perfectly. I feel like we ordered A lot of food but not close to everything on the menu. Which I want to try one day. Lol. All in all everything was fantastic. The food arrived promptly nice and hot not too long after we ordered . Everything was contactless for the most part except for payment. we sat there and ate our food while we watched the cars go by and didn't feel rushed. It's been a couple hours since our visit and I am still extremely full from all the food. I will go back to that location again although it is not close to my home it was definitely worth the drive< /Text><user_name>L Star</user_name>< date>

<Rate>2</Rate><text>I was walking out of Malwart, passing the Golden Arches, and thinking about getting a shake at this hour. But then I got a great idea. “I’ve never been to that Sonic, right outside. I bet they have better shakes.”

I get acquainted with the menu, and decide to try some hot food too. So I get a baby burrito with my classic hot fudge shake.

I don’t know how long it takes to make these things, but I’m guessing it’s instantaneous. Because however long it took to get someone to carry out the order, that’s how long my food was sitting on a counter, getting old.

What are those pink droplets on the hood of my melted shake? When I finished slurping, I found out those were the artifacts of the cherry that rolled off the whipped topping and sank to the bottom of that mess.  Because it was melted.

Zero Fox Given.

I get it. It’s a party night in summer, and you’ll all be going back to school next week. So this job is over anyway. Maybe the Xmas crew will do better. But next time I get that craving for a frosty treat while leaving the big box, I’m gonna just turn right around and grab a carton of mint-chip. Eating it out of the tub in the parking lot is guaranteed to be more awesome.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOY7bJkPBav6Bw6HWBWK3BO0NLLA6pvhHt1NqBP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< response>

<text>Great food, great service. This was our first time at this Sonic and we had a great conversation with the gal who brought us our orders. She was funny and delightful.

I would recommend this Sonic and should I ever pass through American Canyon again, I  will come back.< /text>< Pictures>

So I would give a higher rating, but honestly this place doesn't really deserve it. 1st off, missing food. 2nd, 2 of the hotdogs weren't even cooked!! 3rd, good luck trying to get ahold of anyone here. This place used to be great, now? Not so much. I don't know if we'll go again.< /Text>

Half price drinks after 8 PM right now! Great time for a late shake. Food has been good, but every time I've ordered the boneless wings with BBQ sauce. Drinks have always been good, too. Service has been great, and they always have some kind of line or wait but its expected. Not too bad of a wait for the car park area.<//review>

Fast, friendly great fast food. I like the fact that I can order and pay right in my car and they bring the food to you. You have to try the Chicago Dog on a Pretzel Bun. It was outstanding.< /Text>

So nostalgic. I love the pull up order menus and the eat in your car option. The wait was about 7 minutes which isn't normally an issue but the fries were cold so that was not cool but I still loved everything else.</review>

We waited and while we were talking we realized it had been 20 minutes. I hit the buzzer again and a different voice came on after I explained we hadn't gotten our drinks he said I'm sorry they will be right out.
The girl that brought them out said here are your drinks 2 cherry limeade slushies. I told her we ordered frozen drinks not slush. She said right this is what these are. I said why would you have frozen and slush wording if they are the same? She said it's how they let everyone know the difference between regular and frozen lemonade. I told I dont think that is true but this place has idiots took the drinks and left.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

I think they recently updated the menus here, new touch screen is great for reviewing your order. However! You can't order directly from it, but it certainly seems that what they want you to do in the future.

They are nice over the intercom, as nice as Chick-fil-a which is a great chance from other places around here.

I can't comprehend the size of the menu and it would take me months to work my way through the options.

Also the price is incredible, for $19 we fed two people with a couple combos and sides.

Wow! Wish there was one closer to me.<//Text>

Love the idea of Sonic's parking lot to give an old school way of eating. The food is filling and the staff are always cool. You can create any type of atmosphere you want because you're eating your own car!!</Review>

<review>Food is over priced with small portions. The only reason we go is for the drinks. Theres a large selection but only go during happy hour. The staff is friendly but not very knowledgeable.  Problems do not get resolved in any semblance of a timely manner. Staff has zero knowledge of the app or how to use it.< /review>< pics>

The shakes are really good. The small is medium the medium is large and the large is extra large. The slushies burn my throat and melt too fast. They don't have an option in the menu for a hamburger, only cheeseburgers, so it costs extra. We ordered a cheeseburger without cheese and they gave us a burger with nothing but ketchup and a patty</text>

A nice place to stop if you have children.  My daughter's love the drink choices and being able to create their own.  Food is pretty good, only reason I gave a 4 and not a 5 is because they put my daughter's burger in my bag and my double cheeseburger in her kids meal bag...we didn't figure it out until after eating haha<//review>

We used drive up window to order. Payed for order and was asked if we wanted a receipt, which we responded yes. Received our order, parked to eat and noticed receipt wasn't in the bag and the order was incorrect.  To much effort to get back in line and ask for the correct order which we payed for but with no receipt makes it even harder. (Tip) always get your receipt and check order before you leave window.</text>

<Review>My husband and I are from DeKalb Texas, staying with my mother here in American Canyon California. My sister recently visited from Houston. She was not feeling well but was very specific in her text about what she 'needed' from Sonic. Her order was as follows: “a Sundae, with caramel, strawberries, and hot fudge; each separated by a layer of ice cream. No two flavors together, please. No whip or nuts. They may need to use a larger container.”
My reply was: “nobody is going to do that!”.  Her reply to that was: “if you're nice they will”.
We stopped at the American Canyon Sonic drive-thru and my husband read the text exactly as written.
Not 2 minutes later Brandi brings our order. It was perfect! Furthermore, Brandi was so nice, friendly and understanding. I don't think we've had a nicer experience in a drive-thru.  Thank you Brandi!</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Terrible service and food, my shake was not given to me securely so it spilled over into car. My hot dog had onions on it despite me asking the server what the All-American came with and being told ketchup , mustard, relish .   I will be going in to get a refund as soon as time permits for the long drive again. A pure waste of time, money, and energy .</Text>

Great food but looses one star for a business model that's encouraging people to live isolated in their cars. One should always tip the server. Menu could be easier to read but push to talk button is obvious. Sadly,No gasoline,tire or other automotive care is offered.</review>

Very busy Sonic. It took 5 minutes from the time I hit the button to order food. Food arrived in decent time after ordering. I ordered extra sauce and they forgot it. Delivery guy didn’t know what was in the bag when it was delivered.

Only come here if you have lots of time and appreciate a incorrect order.<//Review>

Fast and courteous with options to go inside, use the drive through, or to stay in your vehicle and have your food brought out to dine or take to go. Endless drinks and some food options you don't find as much at other fast food places which can be refreshing.<//Text>

<Text>Food wasnt the best, it was basically cold by the time we got home (13 minute drive). Fries tasted cold and old, tot container was only half full with none in the bag floating around. The top of one shake wasn't really put on tight and my fiancee ended up wearing his shake all over himself.</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>It's hit or miss with this establishment. Sometimes their employees are nice and customer service friendly; other times very rude and could care less. Sometimes the wait for your order is reasonable; other times it takes 30 plus minutes to get a simple shake. Be prepared for both.<//Text><gmapID>0x80850c727eb1d863:0xb619058afeae4777< /gmapID>< user>

< Review>
Wanted to order three 32 ounce drinks with our meals but they were out of the medium cups.  The 44 ounce cups won't fit in the cup holders so we got 3 of the 20 ounce cups.  Before leaving I asked if we could get refills and we were told there would be a charge, which I expected sense I couldn't get the medium size I was thinking $.70 per drink but the manager said a refill charge would be the full $1.50 price of the small cup.  I asked if I could pay the difference between the small and large which would have been $.90 but they wouldn't do it.

The food was good but not very accommodating for their lack of preparation on a weekend.</Review>

<Review>They should get NEGATIVE STARS....I asked for Pop Rocks when Ingot to the window and as the guy closes the window to run my payment a female worker yelled, "Are you F*%$!EN serious!" When he opened the window I told him I heard what she said, he stood there with nothing to say. It's not the 1st time I've had bad service there, but it's the last time I'll put up with it. Sending it up to Corporate.< /Review>< pics>

<review>#AutismAwareness
How can you tell a mother that she and her son may not order in the lobby because he’s making people uncomfortable?  Sounds like the people [who were uncomfortable]have a personal problem to me, because someone is different it doesn’t mean you can discriminate.
This woman and her son just went to have lunch like any other family... because the young man has autism he was making people uncomfortable. This is OUTRAGEOUS.  If they’re uncomfortable they’re welcome to leave and this young man and his mother have the right just like everyone to order lunch in an establishment. Like everyone else. Different is not less, embrace people with differences, as you will encounter people who are not the “norm” on a daily basis.

I am disgusted and will not ever visit another sonic. Discrimination is NOT OKAY! Apologies are owed here.< /review>< user_name>

<review>We love going to Sonic's... it's our lil treat that we get once in a while but someone always seems to not read the order ticket, it says no pickles or plain and low and behold they screw it up....

But have had trouble with the staff getting the order completely correct 95% of the time if you order at the car stalls.</review></record>

What more can be said , Oceanwater is hands down the best drink ever!!!! Try it ! I sometimes drive a big truck and trailer that measure 44'.....so yes drive thru , I normally can't do. But SONIC has this amazing drive thru that allows big trucks, trailers, etc to drive on thru.  It can be a pain trying to find parking when on the road driving an obnoxiously long vehicle.  So thanks Sonic for Oceanwater and awesome architectural designed building!!!</review>

Staff is rude and horrible. Theatre is 10 minutes away. But after 4 visits with sane result will never go to this drive in again. Instead must drive over 1 hour away to San Jose to enjoy a drive in with my children.<//Text>

<review>Never again will i go back,  i ordered a number 10 and i got a PLAIN chicken sandwich wit a TEASPOON of mayo and two pickles and when i had told them that my chicken sandwich comes with lettuce and tomatoes not dry they took about 30 minutes for them to make another. But the person that brought my order he was nice.</review><Rate>1< /Rate></record>

First and foremost HOW DARE YOU?  You tell a mother with an autistic child that she can't order in because he's making OTHERS uncomfortable....how dare you insinuate that others have more right to be there than a little boy that was BORN WITH DISABILITIES??? PEOPLE like you make me sick!! I personally believe the mother in question should get an attorney. You violated his rights by asking them to leave because he made others uncomfortable.<//text></record>

<Review>Went to Sonic at 9:40 p.m. 03/27. While people were still eating in the car hop areas lights were turned off. Walked to the drive thru window saw employees not only is standing around with each other doing nothing they were ignoring all the customers. First awful experience.  The day crew are always friendly and professional.<//Review>< Resp>

<Review>Footlong corn dog wasn't good! They don't make them like they use to! The dog seem like it was just taken out of the hot water! Cheese always sticks to the see through packaging which ruins the whole Footlong! A black employee wipes his arm sleeves with a wipe in the front counter with all the food sitting on the counter! Do these people not know where the appropriate place to do this is? Do they know how to keep the food clean for us customers? Who wants their lint in your food?</Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Tried ordering from the drive through. We called to ask what time it closes they said 12 on a Saturday.  Came to the speaker box n no one answered. Came to the window said they were closed. Finally called again and said they were open till 12 and told them were trying to order and finally got to order. I'm not sure if they didn't want to work or just confused.  But we finally got our food.  :-/<//Text>

Slow and bad quality.

Took 35 minutes to get 8 cars through the drive through. People inside were just wandering around inside, most not in uniform. Malt wasn't mixed, all the powder was at the bottom. Regular tea had no ice and was sweet when I said three times NOT sweet tea.

Poor example of a Sonic. Will avoid</Review>

Excellent service. Decent food and wide selection of drinks. Burgers aren't the best, but the service makes up for it.</Text>

1/3rd of your customers are probably autsim parents buying your popcorn chicken. I would tread lightly, the autism community is a big one and you dont want to lose a big portion of your income due to a toddler. #AutismAwareness</review>

THEY KNOWINGLY OVERCHARGE CUSTOMERS -- READ!

2 pc Mozzarella sticks are $1.69 on the menu, but are $1.79 on the receipt. When I asked to talk to the manager about it, the manager in training said that they recently raised the prices but haven't received the new menu signs yet.

REALLY? So you're going to KNOWINGLY OVERCHARGE customers? And to top it off, when the carhop delivered the food, she asked if I wanted the receipt (which tipped me off that I should inspect it).

How about waiting until you install the new menu signs before raising the prices? I have a picture of the receipt & the menu board if anyone wants to see it, message me.< /Text>

High calorie food.  I ended up with a small chicken strips and water.  If I was 20 something with a rocking metabolism, I could eat there sometimes...<//Review>

Very slow service, one of the worst sonic experiences in my life and I used to work at a sonic. Waited over 20 minutes for 3 milkshakes.  Keearirra was our server and had a very poor attitude, not friendly.</Text>

Absolutely horrible, waited over 30 minutes for my food. When we asked for the estimated  time they could not give us an awnser while we waited they had over 10 cars served in the drive thru but couldn't help us. Now I am waiting on a receipt for my receipt. We will never eat here again and I recommend that you don't. Either</review>

<review>This place has gone downhill.  The latest was the girl that eventually took my order not knowing what a chocolate malt was. I had ordered and received a chocolate malt just three days before I wanted this one...the remnants were still in my freezer for crying out loud!! It's sad that my hometown sonic is so crappy.< /review><user_name>Aaron Beller</user_name><Gmap_id>0x80850c727eb1d863:0xb619058afeae4777</Gmap_id><Date>1530378318430</Date><Rate>1<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

Went tonight to surprise my bf and they were very busy and person who answered us was very rude and disrespectful to us after telling us that they wouldnt take orders for 15min. 3 times. Very ridiculous! Wont be back unless they apologize.<//Review>

<Review>We never got our food at the pull in parking spot. Instead we got to watch them serve the drive thru. When we asked to cancel our order so we could leave, it took us going up to them to actually get the void receipt. Horrible service here.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Worst Sonics I've ever been too. They forgot a burger in our order and we asked them about it over the intercom, said they'd be right out 10 to 15 min later nothing happens. Tell them again and they basically tried to accuse us of trying to get free food.< /Review><Rate>1<//Rate>< Date>

A beautiful drive in at the "Gateway to the Napa Valley"......aka AmCan. Skip the up-valley white table cloths, and bulk up with a pretzel dog and some cheesy tater tots before pounding some vino.  Clean, quick, and delicious.....it was everything I expected, and my kids were hella happy.<//text>

(Translated by Google) We find sweet and cool shakes when the weather is hot or weary, but getting off to the store is bothersome.
This is a drive-in, so after parking your car, check out the menu and order it, the server will bring it to you.
It's so good, and it's made with ice cream and it's rich in flavor, and even after a while, you can enjoy the same taste until you eat it.

(Original)
우리는 날씨가 무덥거나 피곤할때 달콤하고 시원한 쉐이크를 찾게된다.그러나  매장으로 가기위해 내리는것또한 귀찮아진다.
이곳은 드라이브인이라 차를 주차한후 충분히 메뉴를 살펴보고 주문하면 서버가 차로 가져다주어
너무 좋다.그리고 아이스크림으로 만들어 맛도 풍부하고 시간이 흐른후에도 맛이 그대로라 다 먹을때까지 똑같은맛을 즐길수있다.<//Text>
