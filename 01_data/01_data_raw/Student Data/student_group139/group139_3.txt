< Review>
This place is good. They have a lot of sushi options and other entrees on the menu. The AYCE is worth it especially for large groups. They're pretty quick with bringing out your food after ordering.<//Review>

<review>Food was great, but they could use a little more organization in getting guests seated or queued up to wait. There was no sign in sheet, and when I thought I was next they seated a party ahead of me. I was pretty sure I was there before them, but again, without any tracking, really couldn't tell. Our waitress was great and attentive.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80dceb096a3bdd83:0x61ab5a2025746113<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Gave them a second and third try. Sushi/Rolls are marginal at best. Some were just not stable. Tasted terrible.  Small portions. Service was slow and average at best.  The layout and decor make me feel like I am eating in a cafeteria. Won't be back.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>Great tasting food. I would highly recommend getting all you can eat, but be warned, if you don't eat your food it will be charged at menu price and you can't share it with anyone unless they are an all you can eat customer as well. Also the boba tastes really great</text>< GmapID>

<text>I stopped in for dinner on Sunday night and was pretty stoked to be seated right away. I tried their Korean BBQ dish Chicken Bulgogi and it was amazing. The chicken was seasoned and cooked perfectly and the mushrooms, peppers and onions were a perfect compliment... I will definitely be back.< /text>< pictures>

<Text>So this is all you can eat sushi, but you are allowed to order in 3 turns. They give you a form to order. Not a really big selection, and when you get the sushi, it's half of the regular order. The food is okay considering the price to pay. So, it's an okay deal</Text>< Pics>

<Response>None<//Response><review>I'm a returning customer here for quite some time now. I come here often with my girl friends, and never had a problem until recently when my friend (who has a gluten sensitivity) was told by both the rude waitstaff and the manager she couldn't order rice paper or no rice rolls and was mistreated the entire time on two occasions. Ridiculous was an understatement. This behavior by any restaurant is unacceptable. The only reason why I give this lace four stars is because Jaeb, the nicest waitress here is accommodating and pleasant.</review>< rate>

<review>The all-you-can-eat sushi has very few sushi selections. Their taste was not fresh at all. Other items such mixed tempura were bland-tasting. All items were low cost items - not surprising given the low price of the lunch itself. Not a worthwhile sushi experience.< /review><username>Warren Chu<//username><rating>2</rating><resp>None<//resp></record></dataset><record>

So I have to begin by saying I haven't ever got bad food here and that's mostly why I gave it three stars. But I have to be honest the customer service for dinner is horrible from the hostess to the manager, especially the manager. Will you feel that they close early already at 9:30 p.m. but the other day we went at 8:30 p.m. and they had a sign on their window that says they're closing at 9 p.m. now And they've already done their last round of AYCE. No apology or explanation as to why online it says 9:30 p.m. and now they just go by piece of paper on their window. This isn't the first time they've done this to us too. Like I said the dinner manager has no people skills. Gone at lunch and they have a younger manager who is much better at treating the customers with respect and have not been told that I could only order one round of AYCE like I have at dinner. They need to step up their dinner customer service game or they're going to lose a lot more customers.<//review>

<Review>The lunch is $20 and includes tempura and baked roles (most places don't offer these roles at lunch prices).The sushi was really good. Try the Coto roll it's probably my favorite baked roll. My only complaint is that the rice was firmer than I'm accustomed to. Every one working there is friendly and are quick to serve you.<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>My wife and I had an amazing first time dinning at Mizu.  All of the fish was fantastic and the portion size of the rolls and nigiri were very large.  It was very hard to choose from the enormous number of rolls which all sounds great.  The cocktail list was creative and well executed.  Overall it was a great experience!! Although it was the first sushi place we have gone to in RSM, I would have a hard time going anywhere else.</Text>< Pics>

I've been here 3 times..None of the fish at this place is wild, all farmed....except the mackerel and the live octopus which it was served topped with rice oil (I couldn't eat it). Over  priced.....<//Review>

Last October my wife and I walked into the store on J st to sign up for a basic service plan with a promotional free phone. Duane, the store manager, was very friendly and professional as he assisted us, he listened to what we wanted and showed us the options of free phones with promotion. We thought this is simple and left feeling great. However, a series of problems followed us for months. Instead of the package we requested, he signed us up for a lease program.  It was a complete surprise to discover our two free phones were on monthly leases.  We didn't even know T-mobile had a lease program until we saw it on our second billing cycle.

Of course we reached out to Duane to correct the problem. Duane promised to follow up with the regional manager and get back to us. As you may expect, I did not received a call or email, nor did he return any of my calls or respond to my emails. This was two months of attempts to communicate with Duane, ZERO RESPONSE.  At the same time, I started working with the T-mobile support,  Duane ignored their multiple messagesas well.  Eventually, the problem was resolved through T-mobile customer service. Duane wasn't going to correct the problem, they decided to issue credit to cover the cost of lease of the phones.
Please proceed with caution. If you are signing up for a plan, I highly recommend  double checking your written contract prior to leaving the store. What I thought was a simple and straightforward purchase, instead resulted in months of phone calls with customers service.< /Review>

This store is managed by the kindest and most supportive, manager and staff. They always are friendly and very knowledgeable about technology.  I wish to thank the Sprint Store on J Street for their unconditional support. They always help me with my problems or questions. They offer solutions, not the "run-around", found in so many other cellular providers.  Thank you Gary and your staff for always treating me with help, kindness and respect! Thank you!< /review>

<review>The customer service I received at this store is top notch. I don't typically write reviews but felt compelled to do so because of the excellent customer service I received from Gary Morse. In addition, I observed other Sprint store staff help people even when they were super rude to them. They have customer service down and have single-handily saved Sprint from losing me as a customer.< /review><gmap_id>0x809ad143402fd4d5:0x1792df9b9340692c</gmap_id><pictures>None<//pictures><username>Kristina Gin<//username><user>101444679321665155200</user></record>

<Text>Pros: Excellent service. Very attentive, and really try to work with you on your needs. Knowledgeable staff, with great in-store electronics servicing.

Cons: Sprint's wireless service is terrible. Plus, it seems as if Sprint does not stock this store with enough of a selection of accessories.

If you MUST do business with Sprint, this is the place to do it. Good people, good store. Hopefully Sprint treats them well.< /Text>< Pictures>

A word of advice for Sprint, staff your stores or get faster employees! Fast and knowledgeable employees is what the comsumers want. I have been a customer of Sprint for 10 years, may be time to move on.<//Review></record>

Don't bother calling, employees tend to disregard what you are saying, and talk over you. Which is pointless. If I'm talking, providing information or asking a question, let me completely finish, as I'm focused on talking, not listening. Wait until I finish, so that I may shift from speaking to listening.</text>

Pretty fast for around here.  I go weekends early morning and am always done within an hour.

I subtracted a star because of Jiffy lubes sales practice where the employees are obviously forced to sell you things you dont need.  This time of business model is destroying our economy and needs to be stopped.</text>

They were able to figure out why I could not activate phone on my own, and they got all my contact info moved over to new phone without a hitch. It was a chllenge because they were working with my broken screen phone that they could barely see anything on, but were patient and worked through the challenge.

Customer service sucks,  No smile, just a dry can I help you.  After I told her what I needed, she says oh hold on I have to get it up on computer, um what were you doing (besides talking to your coworker in an empty store) playing a game on the computer?  It took at least 4 minutes for her to start typing to logon.  Once she gets into my account, she tells me I need to contact customer care line to remove a hot spot I wanted removed.  I ask her another question regarding roaming charges, call customer care line.. I am so over Sprint, I'm one of the best customers they've had and I think it's time to go, pitiful customer service at EVERY store I've been too, except for when I went to BEST BUYS and  Leased a phone thru Sprint, oh yeah they don't work for Sprint.  BTW, I was able to REMOVE MY HOT SPOT online myself.. pitiful.<//Review>

<user_name>Sammie Lawrence<//user_name><resp>None< /resp><text>Normally when someone calls to check if your establishment has a particular item in stock, its kinda expected that the' sales person would have knowledge on their entire (or at least most of) stock of merchandise... this just so happened to not be the case. After calling and a long voyage via foot to their destination 4 miles away.... I come to find the ignorant big boned heffer who told me "oh im sure we have your item in stock" was not only incorrect with her assumption but wasted a large portion of my time. As a homeless individual my focus is to survive not deal with extra crap.

Very happy with their printing shop. I had invitations being printed for same day printing and they were nice enough to call me and tell me that the first draft I sent was very blurry and that they’d recommend I try and send over a better copy. I did and they called and told me it came and great and was ready for pickup. I so appreciated the call, because showing up with two kids in store to find out it was blurry would have a been a huge disappointment.  I will be coming back for all future invites.< /review>

I went in to print some documents. The gentleman behind the print station was Shane. He was busy problem solving a situation he had before I walked in. He was kind enough to help me while he working on the other situation as well. I had a hiccup with my self printing. Shane was able to help again. Great customer service. Thanks, Shane.<//text>

<review>Alan and his manager (I forgot her name) went ABOVE AND BEYOND to help me buy 2 new chairs today. Alan explained the benefits of the protection plan they offered and it was an easy choice to get that. Mrs. Manager even helped me all the way out to my car to load up my bulky purchase.

The only bad experience was the white kid lookin like Walmart MGK working the register behind me wearing a blue line mask operating slower than a tenured DMV employee while the rest of his team rushed around him to help not only me, but the other customers in the store. Fire that guy & get 2 more Alans.< /review>< date>

<review>Called a Citrus Heights Staples to see if they have Logitech Master mouse in stock, they didn't, but found that this place had it. They called this place to confirm that they do and were told that they indeed had it. When I got here, the customer support rep told me that no one talked with them and that they did have 2 in stock for an online order. Not for walk ins. Well...Amazon prime to the rescue.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Copy center customer service was very unhelpful, didn't seem interested in helping me at all when I struggled to figure out how to use my 10% off coupon, and seemed annoyed at me when my cards weren't ready when I arrived and it was almost 12 hours after I ordered the 4 hour turnaround business cards. They printed fast though, which made up for the fact that the border looked completely jacked up from what it looked like when I submitted it online. I think I'll pay a little extra to use Vista print next time so I don't have to interact with the customer service hopefully.<//Text>

Went to Staples in Roseville Tuesday afternoon after bad experience at Office Max Forest Lake. Needed invitations and rsvp cards by Wednesday. Ian in the printing dept was very helpful in helping me design my new invitations, gave me the estimated price (which was dead on) and called when they were done Wednesday(4-5-17) afternoon. Went to pick them up after work and everything was correct. Office Max still hasn't printed my invitations, I ordered those thru the same process 4-1-17</Text>

The worst experience ever! dont go near that store...
I walk in to buy a laptop Wednesday september 28th, I saw the one that I wanted and after all considerations, as expected, this places have laptops on display but they DONT have the actual computer on inventory, so I told the guy, well I really need this for this weekend because my kid its going away to collage next Sunday, I will buy it somewhere else, the guy told me NO PROBLEM we can have it shipped and here by Friday! and FREE!... bad bad bad choice! I went to review my order and I found out that it was shipped from Ontario, TODAY, and expected delivered by next tuesday October the 4th.... so I called the store manager and talked to him... he just said.. weellll.. mmmmm... eehhhhh... sorry, theres nothing I can do, but we can refund your money if you want...... WHAT!!??? this guy has ZERO customer service knowledge at all! zero, none, ... I told him but WHY one of you assosiets told me that it was going to be here by Friday? just to make a sale? he said well, I dont know..... long story short my worst experience ever, I dont go to staples often, I gave them a change, WONT ever go there again... this company really sucks...<//text>

I was in staples on 9/24 to purchase some cash register tape for my machine. I found it easily, thanks to the help of a young man stocking shelves who directed me to the area where it was located. I went to the front, stood in line, which was increasing in people who wanted to pay . there were 3 people checking and only one station had its light on to incicate it was open. The station I went to was unlit as well. The checker, a young man of approximately 25 ish and had short curly brown hair, announced " I can help the next person". When I got up there to check out  I said " you should tun on your station light so people will know you are open". He replied " I try not too". I just looked at him for a minute, appalled and said " oh, I get it, you don't want anyone to know your're open". He just smiled. Wow, as an employer myself if one of my empolyees had said that they would no longer BE my employee. Is this what you want to represent you , STAPLES ?< /text>

The manager of the store was very rude when trying to price match an item. Staples has a 110% guarantee for price matches, but the manager Patrick didn't honor it.</Text>

I avoid their copy center like the plague. They never have orders done correctly or on time. I unfortunately have to use them because they are the only copy center close to my store... Half the time i just print stuff here even though i need 30 copies....< /Text>

After checking stock levels online, I visited Staples in Citrus Hts, CA. The display rack showed no refills for my Zebra Gel Pen - - - - but the sales clerk rushed off to get the rolling ladder and accessed the storage WAAAAY up on the storage rack.  We did a price check - and when it did not match the online price - the clerk said just check with our boss upfront.  The boss heard me talking  - she has good hearing - and I bought 4 twin refill packs - for half of OFFICE MAX'S price.<//review>

I Love my Doctor! From there it goes below average fast. The phone number given for questions about billing is never answered. At my office visit, I asked the office staff for my balance so I could make a payment in full, but they informed me they didn't know what it is. Really, who does business like this? My account balance is not accessible on the office computer? So, at the end of my visit I asked for the total for the visit that day and paid it in full only to receive another bill with more charges added, but they are mystery charges as there is not explanation of the charges.  You need to get your house in order!< /text>

< Review>
I was pleased with the treatment and efficiency of this office. Dr Brown listened to my complaints and offered treatment to alleviate my symptoms. There were x-rays taken and I received an injection for my knee pain. The process went smoothly but I did not feel rushed or neglected for any period of time. Definitely left feeling better.</Review>

<Text>Dr. Iain Gallego is my primary physician and he by far has been the best doctor I have ever had. It can be difficult finding the right primary doctor, but I can say with certainty that you will be happy with him. He genuinely cares, listens to all your concerns, and is determined to help you. I mean it when I say he will tirelessly try all avenues in order to get to the root of the issue that ails you. If you are considering a new physician you can rest assure that you be very well taken care of by him and his team. As even his medical assistants are very professional, attentive, polite, and caring as well. Making for an overall great visit from start to end.<//Text>< Name>

Dr Valdez has always been a great doctor.  I was very disappointed to see him leave Dignity Health which I chose to stay with at that time.  I am happy to say it was very nice to be back with Dr Valdez.  He always makes it a point to listen to my health concerns and always is very helpful with my health questions or concerns. Happy to be with Dr Valdez and Adventist Health!<//Text>

<review>The staff sincerely care about the patients, are so polite, and make you feel very much at ease.  They radiate a genuine feeling of being happy to work there, and the physicians are among the most approachable anywhere. There is a sense that all are your partners in health care. While Adventist Health is a huge organization,  patients are dealt with personally, not impersonally, not like mere numbers.

Don't change a thing, except for one thing: Give those hard-working and dedicated people a great big raise!

<Text>I have been seeing Iain Gallego for about 4 years now and I have never had a doctor like him that cared and listened. I don’t feel rushed when I see him and again I have never had that. Every year when I have to re-enroll for my insurance I make sure he is in network so I can continue seeing him. The staff have always been super courteous and nice. I’m always able to get an appointment within a decent time as well. Thanks everyone for caring, it’s refreshing!!!</Text>< GmapID>

My Primary Care physician  is so wonderful, my daughter AND gtandchildten now see her. They are just as pleased with the EXCELLENT  care and concern she has for all her patients.. if you are looking for excellent, personalized care, you are doing yourself a great disservice if you do not check them out!</review>< pics>

So satisfied with Ian Gallegos: knowledgeable, personable, wish more physician assistants and physicians had his bedside manner. Highly recommend.</review>

<Review>Loved the way I was treated and the follow up calls I received.

<Review>Dr Amjadi could practice anywhere yet, fortunately for me, he chose Bakersfield and with his polite, competent office staff, one feels comfortable and cared for every single visit.
Dr Amjadi has pride in his surgical team which is reflected in his great work and positive patient outcomes.  Dr Amjadi and both of his elite hand-picked teams have earned my respect and appreciation.  Thank you again Dr Amjadi and teams, I am grateful for you.

I couldn’t find a more caring and compassionate doctor then Dr. Seidenstricker. He takes time to answer all your questions and  he takes the time to help you overcome your concerns about your health  you may be having at that time.
The main thing that I would have to say that’s a downfall with me is the return of phone calls from the nursing staff and the scheduling of an appts. For something that week.<//text>

I was referred to Dr. Amjadi because I had lower back pain and leg pain. Right when he saw my MRI an X-rays the look on his face showed deep concern. I could barely walk and was leaning to one side because I couldn't put pressure on my left leg. My case was so severe he scheduled for me to have surgery the next week. Its been 6 days since my surgery and I feel no pain. I would definitely recommend Dr. Amjadi to anyone with back pain or neck pain. Before the surgery I looked at Dr. Amjadi's reviews and there wasn't one that was bad and he had 5 stars to top off. I give him 5 stars hands down, Thank you Dr. Amjadi!< /Text>

< Review>
I was very pleased with the attention and assistance provided by Dr Potter and her medical assistant. Their  counsel concerning my long troubling issue with toenail fungus was very much appreciated and spot on. I look forward to my follow up and their commitment to care for my needs for outstanding foot care.</Review>

Dr Dini is excellent!! She really takes the time to listen and answer all your questions and concerns in a compassionate and professional manner. She takes her time with you answering all your questions. She is methodical in her approach and when diagnosing there is no guessing as I’ve had with other physicians, her diagnosis are based on actual facts (MRI, x-rays etc). I was told by 2 other physicians that I had a neuroma just ‘by feel’ and for a year and a half had injections to my foot. It ends up that I do  NOT have a neuroma at all she ordered x-rays and an MRI which showed an entirely different diagnosis. I am so grateful to her! I recommend her highly.<//Text>

Dr. Shih has followed my care since Sept 2020 and he is by far the best physician I’ve ever went to. I have seen many providers and he continues to impress me. He is very caring, compassionate, knowledgeable and I’ve had nothing but great experiences in his office. The staff is great and never had an issue getting messages to Dr. Shih. I have to travel almost 3 hours to go see him and although I can see a local podiatrist, I prefer the travel time because I know I’m in great hands. He’s helped get my life back and I truly cannot thank him enough. If I could give him 10 stars, I would.<//text>

Dr.Dini is amazing! She is very transparent and will let you know what to expect. I had surgery on my toe and everything went great. The downtime was what she said and I was back up and running. My toe is much more comfortable.< /Text>

< Review>
on Friday, I went in to see Dr. Dini for orthotics for bunions, I'd been suffering with for a decade. Considering I went in with such massive amounts of pain, I was put at ease under the professionalism of her team. They advised me, I received x-rays,  toe spacers, got a pedi-cure by Dr. Amelia and we discussed options moving forward and I was quickly on my way, feeling more prepared. Thank you, Dr. Dini!< /Review>

Its my second visit with Dr. Potter and so far so good. I feel really comfortable with her. She was spot on with some of my questions  Again, great service. (December 2020)

I guess my above comment wasn't posted. This is my third visit with Dr. Potter and I was finally approved for my injection. It was painless and felt something good immediately. However, Dr. Potter explained to me that I would need to gauge it through the weeks to see. So not a 100% yet, we will see. Great visit as always...(Jan 2021) Happy New Year everyone!<//Text>

This was my first visit to Bay Area Foot Care. I had been putting off much-needed general foot care, but a minor injury to one foot made me decide to schedule an appointment. Dr. Coast had been recommended to me by a friend. Setting up an initial appointment was easy to do online, and the office called me shortly after and e-mailed me the forms for a new patient. I was grateful for this as I’m trying to minimize time in waiting rooms due to COVID, and I was seen promptly at my appointment time. I was very pleased with Bay Area Foot Care and with Dr. Coast. He put me at ease, treated my foot injury, and clearly explained what kind of ongoing care I will need. I'm very happy to have found Bay Area Foot Care and Dr. Coast.< /text>

<review>I have seen many Podiatrists in my life...(I've asked quite a bit of my feet) and I must say that Dr Vartivarian is the most kind, knowledgeable and straightforward Doctor that I have ever had the pleasure to see.  He explained  the connection of the pain in my feet to the different places in my back that could be causing the discomfort.  He didn't encourage me to buy expensive orthotics until I tried some over the counter models and to also pay more attention to stretching and strengthening my core and back muscles.  Overall though, even above and beyond his extensive knowledge of the 'work horses' of our bodies, it was his kind, patient and gentle presence that I was most impressed.< /review>< response>

I came to UCSF because my doctor back home was unable to help a nasty wound heal. I saw Dr. Dini and Dr Reyzelman once then Dr Dini a second time. I really like her enthusiasm  and the treatment plan she has for me. The staff at her office were wonderful and helpful with answering all my questions. She also made very sure I understood her instructions before I left her office. Highly recommend Dr. Dini for your non-healing foot wounds.< /Text>

I found Dr. Potter online and chose to go to her with a sore foot  because of her 5-star ratings.  After my first experience, I am happy to add my five stars to the list.  I was attended to by two students before seeing Dr. Potter herself, and both of them were as welcoming and professional as they could be, as  was Dr. Potter when I met her.  She gave me a good explanation of why my foot was hurting and suggested orthotics to help correct the problem.  Since the office didn't have any of the orthotics she wanted me to wear in their office, they called a nearby Bay Area Foot Care office and arranged with them to have the orthotics ready for me when I arrived.  I was told that Dr. Potter always tries mass produced orthotics first because they are much less expensive than having them custom-made; I appreciated her concern for my pocketbook.</text>

< review>
Dr. Potter and her wonderful and well trained support staff did a fantastic job on my little toe! I've had a bone spur for years that I've been delaying surgery on, and I'm so pleased with the results. Besides the bone spur, she realigned (Arthroplasty) the joint, which was the root of the problem. The whole staff at Bay Area Foot Care, and everyone at the St. Mary's Surgical Dept. was top notch. If you need foot surgery, have Dr. Potter and St. Mary's take care of it. She's my first phone call if I have any other foot issues.< /review>

Dr. Potter is wonderful...very supportive, encouraging,  and fully engaged with my progress as a patient. I so appreciate her caring bedside manner, and feel as though I couldn't be in better hands as I move through this process toward complete recovery from a fairly substantial injury. Thank you!< /Text>

<Text>My first appointment experience exceeded my highest expectations. Front office logistics are convenient, efficient, and professional. Someone answered the phone right away, found me an appointment, and streamlined the first visit paperwork. Even getting my online portal set up before leaving the office was easy. Best was the care I received from Dr. Vartivarian and his medical staff. Suffice it to say, I’ve had the same foot issue for over 14 years, and today was the first time I left a doctor’s office not frustrated but instead hopeful.</Text>< Pics>

< Review>
My father came Dr. Vartivarian in October 2020 with the bleeding wound on his foot. Dr. Vartivarian treated his wound for several weeks, and diagnosed him with serious disease. For follow up treatment Dr. Vartivarian referred him to the  hospital, and offered that his office will continue to provide him with podiatric service when needed in the future.  In January 2121 we scheduled podiatric service in Dr. Vartivarian office. My fathers feet need special care now due to his desires, The service was done promptly and perfectly, my father was very happy. Dr. Vartivarian  and the staff in his office are highly professional, responsive and caring. If I could give ten stars to this office I would do it without hesitation.</Review>

< Review>
Walking into the office I was very nervous. After meeting with the staff they quickly put me at ease and made me very comfortable about my injury. I saw Dr. Dini—she is the best! She treated me as a person—with respect and dignity. She saw that I was taken care of. I would recommend coming here first for your feet problems.</Review>

<Text>Dr. Dini is an awesome doctor: she's empathetic to her patient's concerns, listens, and finds the care that is best for her patients. In my case, I was diagnosed with a bone spur problem for years; other doctors treated it using minor surgery that never fixed the problem. A year ago, Dr. Dini correctly diagnosed the problem as joint related; one surgery and one year later: no more discomfort or pain; I couldn't be happier. In fact, I went "back for seconds" this year — same problem with my other foot; I now have "happy feet" again. If your feet are bothering you, go and see Dr. Dini.<//Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Dr Potter takes her time, she listens, watches you move and makes assessments, but keeps an open mind when evaluating progress.
She determined one of my foot issues might be coming from a back problem.
She reached out to my chiropractor and gave him her opinion, he agreed.
So has been very helpful.</Review>

Knowledgeable, compassionate, upbeat, accommodating,  inventive:  If one way of healing doesn’t work (not all bodies, alike), she tries another.  She really goes the distance for her patients.

<review>I always think, I ought to review more often - good & bad. So, when it came to reveiwing Dr. Potter after my foot surgery, I felt it was a must! Her care, professionalism, knowledge, and guidance was amazing. She 100% has the patients best interests in mind & is available to make sure things are going well. Overall, Bay Area Foot Care was one of the best experiences I've ever had with a medical clinic. Thank you!</review>< gmap_id>

<Response>None< /Response><text>This was my first visit and I didn't get past the waiting room.  While filling out the stack of forms (which they could have sent me ahead of time to fill out), one of their medical personnel walked right by me without a mask.  When I looked up, I saw another employee wearing her mask as a chin strap.  In San Francisco it is required to wear masks outside, in elevators, and public buildings.  No one should be comfortable visiting a doctor's office where safety protocol are not followed to the T - particularly during the current COVID surge.  And yet the office called me after I left and rather than apologizing tried to claim that it "didn't matter because the person in question was just arriving to work".</text><Date>1594828168795</Date><user>111181897176095802273<//user>< Name>

Update: 6/7/2021 - Follow up visit and everything from checkin with the receptionist to review of current condition with intern and Dr. Dini was good.

She helped to diagnose my medical condition and provided the proper treatments and referrals to the proper specialist to manage the issue.<//Review>

<rate>4</rate><text>We went on a quiet Thursday afternoon. Their Hong Kong waffle is worth every penny. It's amazing, crispy on the outside light and fluffy on the inside, it comes out freshly made to order every time!  There's dozens of fillings to choose from for only 50 cents more, and there's different flavor waffles including mochi, green tea, chocolate etc.< /text>< Pictures>

<text>The chai latte is a little weak on the spice side, so maybe ask for extra chai. The jasmine peach cold brew tea was really good:) this is in a really really nice location. The shopping center has so many shops and restaurants, there's a fountain, and multiple neat lounge areas, and a koi fish pond. Super nice:)<//text>< pics>

<text>I love the early mornings before the gym. My cup of coffee keeps me warm as I make my way to 24 Hour Fitness. My coffee gets to me quick and served with a friendly smile. Great way to start your day:) check it out.<//text><time>1575628643266< /time><gmap_id>0x80c29c219f6fa67b:0x9b5e4a8c7cc051f< /gmap_id><Rating>5< /Rating></record>

Pleasant location, but the Village always is pleasant. I got the Mixed Berry Cold Brew Tea. If you don't like things overly sweet then I suggest asking for only 1 pump instead of the typical three. That was plenty sweet for me. It was pretty refreshing.<//Text>

Cool place to hang out and get some work done.  The only thing, I wish there were some more power outlets in case you need to plug in.

Would definitely go back.< /Review>< name>

Coffee Bean is the only place I go for blended coffee! The winter dream tea is my absolute favorite every holiday season! And the chai blend here is also delicious. They are very accommodating to milk and powder substitutions. I always have to get half powder because the full scoop they add is a bit too sweet for me. Happy to see this location is always busy and many customers sit and lounge on their laptops, it's not the quietest space but definitely a friendly staff.<//Text>

<text>The person making coffee was so lazy to change the coffee powder in the filter before making an Expresso shot. Usually this place has good coffee, but the staff is lazy and not so friendly. I believe the management is very relaxed and don’t care about their customers.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><time>1579906100196</time>< Rate>

<Text>I walked in this morning to get a drink while I waited for the stores to open (it's Saturday morning). I ordered a matcha latte. Sat down outside to enjoy but realized it was too sweet. I usually ask if the matcha is sweetened but forgot to do so here. I was gonna let it go and just dump the drink. But I had another 45 minutes before the stores opened. So I went in and asked the young man at the register if there was any way I could change my drink. Not only did he agree to do so with a kind smile, he brought it out for me when it was ready. I'm impressed. The five stars is purely for the service.<//Text>< pictures>

For how busy this location is they should have more associates to keep up with the traffic. Always messy, and trash always overflowing. This has nothing to to with the associates there they are clearly understaffed. This location needs more associates to keep up with the large traffic demand.<//Text>

<review>Super fun and tasty. You can order online or wait in line. They have crepes, ice cream, and boba with cute characters. The workers are incredibly as sweet as their treats.< /review>< Pics>

Fantastic. Nice character smile to round off a beautiful crepe. Not just the appearance is great but also the taste. Yummy, can't help but I guess I'll always come back for more flavors. Highly recommended!<//Text>

<Text>What a cutie crepe, I feel like that I just wanna stare at it the moment its handed to me, so cuteee! But I realized it'll melt if I didn't.
Taste is awesome, delicious, sweet and chewy. Can't wait to come back again then try another flavor. Highly recommended!</Text><time>1609282580214< /time><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPE-_wJv6-wnF1-6jJ2jgTjeM7n40nv--L8TYNE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< response>

Time after time, Belly Good never fails to impress me! There is almost always only one person in the stall, and the staff is always professional and courteous, regardless of how busy they are. Very reasonably priced with great flavor combinations! I always stop by when I am in San Francisco!!<//Review>

I ordered two drinks which I believe were mango with boba and peach with lychee and I also got two crepes. The drinks and the crepes were delicious! Also we were given ice cream on our crepes and we were told it was on them which was such a nice gesture. Will definitely be back there! The employees were very welcoming and polite.< /text>

It's always a pleasure to come here! Whenever I visit San Francisco or show people around there, this is near the top of places to go.
The faces they make on the crepes are unique and adorable, and the variety of crepe flavors are affordable and delicious. This restaurant is definitely a little treasure!<//Text>

<Text>Actually is 3 1/2 star, not so clean the place. Staffs very friendly and the crepes very funny funny when you ask wrapped. They make bear or other animal cute face. They only accept cash.< /Text>< pictures>

I don't care much for the designs they make on the crepe but they are pretty impressive. They put way too much whip cream and it was a little too soggy with the ice cream. They should of cooked the base of the crepe a little more.<//review>< Pics>

I'm a big fan of Belly Good crepes over the more touristy Sophie's crepe on the other side of Japan town.

Belly Good reminds me of authentic Japanese crepes from Harajuku. Soft and chewy with great toppings inside. I always opt for getting ice cream as well as a finishing touch. And they always top the ice cream with a silly face that's totally Snapchat or photo worthy.</Review>

Wanted to try a different crepe in this area and choose this one for the cute presentation. Ordered a custom crepe:

Expresso ice cream with chocolate sauce, pudding, custard and whipped cream. Original crepe batter (optional green tea)

Every ingredient was delicious. It had a large amount of whipped cream but it helped balance out the sweetness of the ice cream. The chocolate sauce had small bits of chocolate which greatly helped the texture of the crepe since we ordered all soft ingredients.

There's only 3 tables in the storefront but there are plenty of seats throughout the mall.

Tip: You always need whipped cream. I thank the worker for asking us. CASH ONLY</Text>

<text>A unique little find, tucked away in a shopping mall in Japantown.  Offering both sweet and savory crepes you will find a wide array of options however, there are numerous menu boards and confusing signs that will leave you a little confused until you start ordering.

We ordered a mixture of savory and sweet and waited and waited until our number was called.  a crepe of salmon and cream cheese for me and a crepe with ice cream for my kiddo and both were gr-iz-ate.

They even made the little bears on my son's ice cream which he got a kick out of.< /text>< Rating>

Staff is super insistent about you having your number even if you're the only one who's ordered in the last 15 minutes.  I have to assume that's management's fault.  The faces are cute and the crepes are tasty, anyways.< /text>

A hidden gem inside the Japan Town Center.... What makes this little dessert place stand out are the artistic creations decorated on top of simple scoops of Ice cream and dessert crepes.  They also dry their own sliced strawberries, to add as toppings and for decorations.  The family that runs this little shop are very nice and helpful ... Service with a smile!!< /Review>

The way these people make their crepes look with the cute characters made of whipped cream, ice cream, cereal, and such just makes me happy. I brought my friend from Santa Barbara here and she loved the boba here. It was her first time and she got lychee boba and she loved it. If you’re going anywhere here, make sure to visit here, nippon-ya, and the chocolate chair. This place is a must!< /Review><Rate>5</Rate>< name>

If you have kids, you have to take them here. Bring cash and tip.  Great double rainbow ice cream. Tasty and fresh ingredients.  Cute artistry.  Trying to get not get gluten cereal decor on a cup of ice cream with fruit can be challenging, language barrier. Trying to get crepe free bowl can be challenging.  I need ask what language they speak, so I can learn to ask exactly what I want. I should probably deduct a star, but when I want to suffer with my gluten intolerance, I don't seem to experience enough punishment to dampen the pleasure of these treats.  I prefer their desert crepes.</review>

So cute and Kawai.
Ice cream and Crepes with funny shapes. You can choose flavors, simplify or add toppings. Tea is good as well.
Friendly staff but the plaza itself needs to be taken care of.< /Review>

<Text>I only came here to pay $8 a crepe because I love novelty food, anything cute, sugar, and well, crepes and ice cream. TBH, I feel like I could stick a couple of colored corn chips and a marshmallow on a scoop of ice cream and call it a bear. Or a dog. Or elephant...

In reality, I wouldn't really buy a whole bag of chips to make one dessert and I sure don't have a crepe stove at home. The verdict - they were actually really good. I like the crepe part which was soft and chewy, and the ice cream (I chose vanilla) was really good too. I tired the green and it tasted natural and not artificial.

Overall, as much as I would like to make fun of this place, it's actually really good and cute as well. I'm such a sucker for cute and sweet foods

I've been coming here regularly for over a decade. My main order: green tea boba. I've ordered the crepes before too and am always blown away. It has had the same owner for at least 15 years and their prices have (relatively) stayed the same since opening. There is often a long line and very limited seating, but trust me, you won't be disappointed.<//review>

Always wonder what this place was like so we finally tried it after 10 years of first seeing it.  Food comes out fairly quickly and prices were fair.  Crepes are of lower quality compared to other shops in the area.  The crepe feels cheap, as well as the ingredients.  Fruits are sparse and whip cream felt oily and unhealthy.  They make very cute designs on their whip cream of animals.  Seating is limited.<//review>

<text>My favorite crepe place! Not only are they delicious and have adorable little faces, but this place has been open since I can remember. It's cash only (~$6-7), so keep that in mind, but worth it. They're usually busy, but also quick about getting orders out. Like most crepe places, you can watch them make it.< /text>< Date>

Very creative crepes. They can design your ice cream from an angry bird character to hello kitty to pikachu. The whipped cream they use aren't very sweet which is a plus for me. Definitely a must-try place !</text>

Being a tourist, my friend agreed to take me here after dinner. The concept of make a crepe cone and creating a bear out of the ingredients is so cute! I am a sucker for sweets and cute things. If I am ever in SF again, I will want to go back and try something different.<//review>

Sophie's Crepes usually has too long of a wait, so this place another great option. The wait here is never too bad, even if there's a line. Unlike Sophie's Crepes, the crepes at Belly Good are softer. There's also a lot of options for making custom crepes, but their premade ones are extremely delicious as well! They're known for their "happy face" crepes--which essentially means they'll make some kind of adorable sculpture out of the ice cream on your crepe. Always puts a smile to my face. :)< /review>

This is, by far, my favorite crepe restaurant in SF.   The crepes have the perfect consistency and texture - and they are delicious!  They use Double Rainbow ice cream and real whipped cream - yum!

Located in the Japantown mall, this place is staffed by very friendly people who seem to really enjoy their jobs.  Each crepe that comes out has a unique design which is always cute and loved by both children and adults.<//review>

Tip: it's a bit gimmicky but it's cute too. Order the simple crepes with ice cream and whipped cream and receive a special animal face.  It makes a quick and sweet dessert that the young at heart will love.< /text>

<review>Typical tourist crepe, but so worth it. I love getting my cute little face crepes despite the line, wait, and price. The good thing about this place is that they have a wide variety of options to choose from.

When we want crepes and Sophie's line is out the door, we come here.  There's still a line most of the time during the weekends, but they get through the line quickly.  The service here is friendly.  My daughter love that they made her a crepe teddy bear one time.</text>

Sooo cute. I think the crepes are good (not mind-blowing) but it's fun getting a crepe with a cute animal face on it. I got a strawberry cheesecake ice cream with whipped cream and a red bean add-on. The red bean was a bad idea and didn't meld.

The crepe itself is soft and chewy, which I really liked but I understand that others prefer a crispy crepe. It held up well, even after eating for a while - instead of getting my hands very sticky.

All in all, the face was adorable and made me smile but I kind of wish I had gotten the face-less banana and cream cheese crepe that they had on the menu. Next time!<//text>

These crepes are almost too cute to eat! No matter which one you pick, the staff uses ice cream and toppings to decorate your crepe with a little pig, bear, frog, etc. They are adorable and more importantly delicious. There's a variety of toppings and prices are reasonable.

It's located in the Japantown shopping center where there are lots of good restaurants and stores.</Review>

I came here since I was a kid and I always love it.

They're best known for the crepes and have a ton of options.
The crepes not only look cute- can be designed into a bear but, are great to eat as well!

The service is fast and friendly.</text>

Came in for a sweet desert crepe and wasn't disappointed. Made it for me in a flash and the banana strawberry filling was delicious. Wife got some interesting ice cream and waffle type desert which was also good.</text>

This was pretty cool. Never had Ice Cream in a crepe like this. It was tasty but seemed novelty. I'd rather just have my cone.</text>

The ice cream is very tasty, especially the mochi ice-cream. Every serving of regular ice-cream comes with a cute face. The price is very decent, we got to orders of mochi and two single ice-cream orders for 10 dlls. The staff is very nice and the service is fast. There is a table in case you want to eat there and there are benches throughout the mall. Also, you can enjoy the ice cream while taking a walk through Japan Town mall center.</Text>

The happy face crepes are filled with a bit too much whipped cream for my liking, so it was a 3 star crepe. The adorable happy face is totally worth a star though. :)< /Review>

Amazing ice cream.
Great style of crepe ice cream cone with adorable animals made out of toppings.
Totally worth it.
Strawberry cheesecake icecream with strawberries and nutella was bomb.</Review>

<Rate>4<//Rate><text>How cute are these crepes!!!

Honestly, the only lure that got me to come here was because I saw how they decorate their crepes (CUTENESS OVER TASTE...at least in the IG world hahaha) but luckily the taste did not disappoint!!

The crepe was soft and the ingredients were fresh! I liked how it wasn't overly sweet, a big plus for me!

And as many people stated before, CASH ONLY!</text>< Pictures>

<text>Come here if you want to instagram/snapchat/(add other social media) a picture of an adorable animal-shaped ice cream crepe. For a little over $5, you get a crepe with ice cream flavor + sauce of your choice adorned with other toppings to create an overly-cute animal face.

I got a green tea bear with marshmallow snout and fruit loop ears, and paired my ice cream with honey (one of my favorite combos is gt + honey). The crepe was warm, fresh and delicious, and all of the ingredients generally balanced well to make a not overly-sweet dessert. Other toppings such as fruit, having a green tea flavor batter, and sweets will run you a little extra, but they have tons of customization options. My simple crepe was still quite solid, and recommended as a photo-op and snack while taking a break from shopping in Japantown.<//text><GmapID>0x808580b8d7c745a3:0x8575070506231f69</GmapID>< Resp>

There's usually a long line everytime I come here but I had to take my sister and her boyfriend here. They loved the kawaii-ness of the crepe but was also surprised that the ice cream itself was good too. They almost did not want to eat it because it was too cute. They had the vanilla and green tea ice cream while I had the strawberry cheesecake one. They're all really creamy and good. The strawberry cheesecake actually had pieces of cheesecake in it. The line relatively goes by quickly and you get your stuff in good time as well. I think it was worth it if you're around Japantown.</Review>

Haven't tried anything else, so holding judgement on that, but the milk tea is actually just bad. Tastes like drinking sand. Easily the worst I've ever had.

The boba in the tea is also bad but at least bearable.</Review>

Disgusting Thai tea. Neon orange and artificial. Does not taste like Thai tea at all, more like tootsie rolls. Gross.<//Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Another ideal place for gourmets!
Belly Good Cafe & Crepes offers pancakes that can be brought to life by giving them a cutest Kawai look!
But do not trust their commercial aspect, these pancakes are prepared with the Japanese method and offer a really fine texture! You just have to choose your favorite ice cream and before!

I haven’t been in in a few months but always the best customer service from the girl, Amy, I believe. She’s awesome and very knowledgeable!

This successful small business has great staff, lots of selection & excellent prices... But that doesn't even begin to touch to express how special they actually are... As a friend and a member of the community, I am treated with caring - they do care - I always visit for a few mins.... I've been educated quite a bit on different products & I've even been encouraged to quit smoking...
Today blew my mind - he fixed the lock on my car door - who does that??? People who care about people 💖 Thanks again so much 💞</text>

<review>I quit smoking about 10 years ago I consistently go to this store all the time T and Morgan always give amazing customer service great recommendations and know what they're talking about they have very diverse selection not only in vaping but water pipes and other products I always go there for my supplies and I don't plan on changing anytime soon their family owned business their prices are exceptionally competitive and well and they're all about customer satisfaction I remember when my ex-girlfriend didn't like the mod that I bought her they actually gave her since they didn't have the color they wanted a better one and just completely swapped it never forget that but regardless if you want a great place to go with a great staff and good selection go there now!!!!!<//review><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>The chick that helped me was so badass! She was real with me about everything and didn’t try to push anything on me. My intention was to just check it out and get a juice but I fell in love with a vape I saw and she made it possible for me to get it and showed me how to use it and everything. She also gave me samples which I’ve never been offered from other stores I’ve bought from. Excellent experience!!<//review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x54d293327ff446fd:0x9e0b0346f57c02fb<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The woman at the counter was very helpful in choosing a new vape flavor. You never know until you buy it to find out if you like a new flavor but we followed the vaporista's advice and love it. Thank you!< /Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< name>

Always a pleasure, and wines are excellent regardless of price point (which to be fair, may be slightly higher than average, but so worth it). Have come a few times for wine tastings, once as a guest for their phenomenal harvest dinner, and just recently for the seasonal Eat Drink RSV experience (5 wine tastings and 3 mini course food pairings) which was an awesome treat — perfect amount for a light lunch. Was so good, signed up for their wine club Gluttons & Gourmands so we can come back more often to take advantage of their wine and food tastings and events!</Review>

Basically no wine education and no personal service just a drop and go service for wine tasting. Not what you want out of a napa tasting. Unfortunate, we were really excited for this one.<//Review>< Pictures>

The Libration White, Los Carneros 2019 was great and came with a complimentary bottle Ritrovo Selections Turmeric Balsamic Vinegar and about the wine and recipe.  I made it 3x already! Great pairing</Review>< userid>

Great experience with an excellent view and friendly staff. We tried multiple wine tastings in Napa and this was the best. We are not experts in wines and all we were looking for was a nice presentation, and a good history on what we were having. Chris was nice enough to cover all 5 wines (nothing orange, despite some other review I saw) and a brief history on the vineyards. As people who just wanted to have a good time with a nice view and outside seating (and not necessarily judging the quality of wine cuz I am by no means a wine enthusiast) we truly enjoyed the experience.<//review>

What a solid gem in Napa. It is not on the main road, but it is very much worth the detour. We sat on their sun soaked patio looking over Napa and the serving staff was phenomenal. They sat down with us (masked and socially distanced) to explain the origins of the wines and why they were different. I am not the most knowledgeable regarding wine, but they were not at all condescending or pretentious when I asked questions unlike other wineries in Napa. What else was so different about RSV was that I loved ALL of the wines in the tastings. Usually I will like 2 maybe 3 of the 5 tastings but at RSV I could have bought a bottle of all 5. I even bought a bottle without trying it (their Rose) because I trusted their wines so much. I will definitely be returning and am seriously considering becoming a member.< /Text>

They serve you 5-6 different types of wine (white, red, and “Orange”) all in a single PLASTIC cup. No care for the presentation or taste of their wine. It’s the single worst experience I’ve had in any wine tasting. Go anywhere else but here. You’ll be happier.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Did the chef's table yesterday with Justin as our server. I'm sure it's not as good as the pre-covid experience with the wine cave tour but it was amazing for what it was in this day and age. Started with a little garden tour.  All the courses we're light just the right portion and pared with wonderful wines. It was a relaxing 2 and a half hours though it got hot on the patio even in shade.  Comfortable experience not stuffy or pretentious. Excellent wines. I especially like the pinot. Worthy of your time in my opinion< /Review>

Beautiful patio seating to enjoy their flight of five which were good quality. Los Carneros Pinot Noir 2014 was the star of the show - a fruity, light red. Abraxas 2014 white the better of the two. The gentlemen serving us really friendly and knowledgeable when we asked questions.

What the Napa wineries lack compared with other countries is an attentive service at the table with the tasting, but it must be the style here so not a criticism of this particular one alone.</Review>

Had a super great tasting here! The abraxis was amazing, the 2011 Marcien had me wanting more as well. Gorgeous views. Good wine. Great people. Worth a trip here!</text>

< Review>
RSV is a very nice boutique winery on the Silverado Trail. This is a smaller but very interesting Organic winery known for its reds. The founder (Robert Sinskey) is a famous ophthalmologist from Santa Monica, CA

After 20 years, Robert Sinskey’s philosophy is that “Wine is not an athletic event” holds true to this day. His goal has always been to make “pure wines of character that pair well with cuisine”.

Was pleasantly surprised at how warm and inviting this place was. It was easy to find, easy to make a reservation at, and the staff was friendly and warm.< /Review>

We had a great experience at this winery. We originally stopped in because they were close and didn’t require reservations, but we were amazed at how beautiful the location was, how amazing the wine tasted, and how accommodating the staff was. This ended up being our overall favorite winery from our 3 day trip.< /text>

The Perfect Circle Tour at Robert Sinskey Vineyards was one of the highlights of our trip! We thoroughly enjoyed the wine pairings and small bites at our lovely table tucked in amid the wine barrels in the cave. The staff were all very friendly, knowledgeable, approachable, down-to-earth, and genuinely into the mission and vision of Sinskey Vineyards. We ended up being there nearly three hours and loved every minute! I highly recommend the Perfect Circle Tour!</Text>

The younger guy pouring our tasting rubbed us the wrong way and we wanted to leave half way through. Full of himself and condescending he was snobbish to us since we are new to this. He also basically just ignored me and was glaring/attempting to flirt with my wife the whole time. I think it would have been better if we had a different person. Definitely wasn't apart of the family and was hired on later, but acted like he had planted every vine there and wanted us to think he was the most important person.<//text>

Enjoy drinking wine? Enjoy Robert Sinskey wine? Buy a case to have your fee waived or stop complaining about a tasting fee. Who wouldn't want a few bottles to take home and help re-live good memories?
Wonderful friendly service throughout our tasting from multiple servers who were not only knowledgeable of the wines but attuned to the spirit of the Vineyards philosophy as well. Top that off with tasty morsels fresh from the kitchen and a peaceful patio to enjoy it all from. Thank you for a wonderful afternoon spent sipping on savory wines. We'll be back soon!<//Text>

We were looking for something a little different than "step to the bar and sip 4-7 different wines", and we really enjoyed the two-hour version of walking through the garden/cave and then sit down for a well executed lunch with loverly wines.  We ended up many bottles so we can recreate the experience at home.<//Review>

The hostess was amazing and wonderful, and the food pairings were awesome.  The problem is they wouldn't do the tasting I was hoping for.  I cannot stand pinot noir but they kept pouring it.  I love Petite Sirah and other varietals, and they have those, but we didn't get to do a tasting with that.  The Abaraxis is good for a white wine, but I would have loved to taste and shop for the wines that match my flavor profile.< /review>

<text>I'm a member at this winery. Fantastic hosts, always treat me like family, and their reds are to die for. Not to mention the fact that they provide a plate of small bites to enjoy with your tasting. Quite frankly, this place has ruined me for other wineries.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

Exceptional visit! Was toured and, more importantly, educated by our host Eric. His passion for Napa winemaking and Sinskey specifically was invaluable in helping us appreciate the process as much as the outcome
Thank you Eric for a wonderful day, thank you Sinskey family!<//review>

<Text>Solid wines on the tasting menu, but I'd focus on the reds here. I had the chance to interact with 3 different tasting room pourers during my visit and some were very knowledgeable and friendly. Their tasting fee structure is not conducive for those who just want to buy one bottle or two, but such is par for the course in Napa. Would definitely like to come back and taste some of the higher end wines here.<//Text><UserId.>107615480983540079483<//UserId.>< pictures>

We did EAt Drink RSV, and it was delightful.  The pairings were perfection, and we enjoyed our host, Eric.  He was happy to answer questions and overall, it was our best winery experience while in Napa.  Definitely plan a visit, if possible.</Text>

Raised tasting price to $45 per person but didn't advertise the increase anywhere. Wines are good but not memorable enough to spend that much on a 5 pour tasting! Our host thanked us for returning and bringing friends because we're locals but wouldn't waive a tasting fee even with purchases. We used to frequent this winery but will not be returning.<//review>

They showed what hospitality was and this place showed they are pretentious. Wanted to buy 6 bottles of wine and they wanted to charge a tasting fee of $40 each. $40 for a glass (5 tastings) when their wine bottles were 40-45. Bye.
Their Pinot Noir is good, but not that good.<//review></record></dataset><record>

i have visited and left a glowing review on Yelp last year. But since my last visit, they changed the tasting fee which is now outrageous $45 per person. Yes, it includes a tiny delicious snack plate, but there is no reason to charge that much, even in Napa. I LOVE Sinskey wine, and the bottles are reasonably priced (for Napa). But the tasting fee is not cool. I expressed my sentiment to the nice people pouring wine and they both agreed that the new price is not something they personally agree with as well. So I actually left without tasting or buying. I hope the owners will rethink their approach. $20 fee with an optional $10 for snack would be the average Napa tasting fee structure.< /text>

<review>(Translated by Google) As is well known, wine is a matter of taste, we didn't really like the wines here. The tasting for 5 wines costs 40.- per person, which is a very proud price. Unfortunately, the service was on the low side. The same wine glass was always used for the 5 different wines, whether red or white, so I expect a little more for this price. We weren't really looked after during the tasting and never really felt welcome. A bit of a disappointment right at the beginning of our Nappa Valley tour.

Wein ist bekanntlich Geschmacksache, uns haben die Weine hier nicht sehr zugesagt. Die Degustation für 5 Weine kostet 40.- pro Person, was ein sehr stolzer Preis ist. Der Service war leider eher tiefes Niveau. Für die 5 verschiedenen Weine, egal ob Rot oder Weisswein wurde immer das gleiche Weinglas verwendet, da erwarte ich für diesen Preis dann schon etwas mehr. Wir wurden auch nicht wirklich betreut bei der Degustation und fühlten uns nie richtig Willkommen. Eine kleine Enttäuschung gleich zu Beginn unserer Nappa Valley Tour.</review>< gmap_id>

I am so disappointed and upset with the service I just received (Sunday, November 22, 2020). One of my nails got smugged as I was being rushed out before my nails were fully dried. I told the nail technician. She brushed over the smudge with clear coat but it still looks terrible. Then she went to the back to get more supplies, I thought. After a few minutes I asked the receptionist if she could get my nail technician. She came back and told me that she left for the day. And the soonest they could get me back in for a nail fix would be Wednesday.</Text>

<Text>When removing the gel from my nails using the shaving machine, it took off a piece of skin from my finger. I understand mistakes happen so while that finger stopped bleeding she tried to finish the other one , when almost having the same mistake. I decided to leave and let the manager know the situation, turns out she was the young lady sitting at the front desk. Being a prior manager, if you hear an issue with your customers you go and give a helping hand, which she didn’t. Once she saw my finger her response was very unconcerned and trying to brush off that it was the first time it happens that my finger will be fine. I’ve done my nails for years and never had an incident like this.</Text><rating>1<//rating><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x808567264e3e330b:0x5da3a37e1f297fe1< /gmap_id><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQ9MlhMfgPUe9PE3GtwePHooPvORwvc4Yck7WZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMP-xIOMCwpxeNpJvh1fu08N0naxZQfdR-Wc2lA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><userid>109989728993757643224</userid>< user_name>

<review>I give two stars because the nail technician was nice. Overall service is poor due to not rectifying an error on their part. I was told that a re-polish would be done at no extra charge. When I showed up at the nail salon, I was told I would be charged! Don't think they want new customers.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x808567264e3e330b:0x5da3a37e1f297fe1< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Bollinger nails is my go-to salon! Van does a great job with dip manicures. She gets the shape perfect, and they last for weeks!< /text>

I paid extra to have her put rhinestones on both ring finger nail. The rhinestones on both nails came off an hour after of leaving the salon. Also when my gel nail polish was curing one nail on my left hand did not cure properly. She notices it when she went to put the top coat. Instead of removing the polish correctly, she just removes it with her finger, added another coat of polish and has me cure it again. It still didn't cure properly and the nail is lumpy. I ended up having to go home and remove the rhinestones, buff off glue off and add my own rhinestones. I don't think that I'll be coming back.<//Text>< pics>

Such a lovely, warm, inviting environment.  I enjoyed both a manicure and pedicure at a reasonable cost.  My technician Lisa was very sweet and professional, listened to my needs/requests and also provided suggestions.  She was able to repair a botched job done by a different salon.  I've found my new happy place!<//review>

First time coming here. It's been a long while for me. You would say I'm picky but I'm really just looking for cleanliness and great work . I  Read some reviews and I decided  to make my own judment. Called made an appointment 1:30pm. I showed up a couple minutes  before.soo freacken clean ! I had time to use the restroom which was also clean ✔. My lady Mary was on time✔ took her time✔ one of the best french gel polish ✔. Everything was out of  sealed  package ✔ so you know the take the time to clean there tools. Yes things do happen but I would definitely recommend  Bollinger Nail Salon. Next time I will add dip power nails. 💅< /Text>

Made an appointment this morning for a gel manicure and regular pedicure. A bit confused that I wasn't seated in the pedicure seat for both experiences. I hate leaning over for my nails to be done. Lily was very quick and efficient, though. Would have given a good tip for a good, deep massage on my hands and feet, therefore leaving a four star instead of five star review.<//review>

I have been going to the concord salon for over seven years. I love my manicurist however today I had a bad experience. I chose a color from the perfect match selection.  Clearly it was not a perfect match. I’ve had this happen before but never said anything. Today I spoke up because I’m getting ready to go on a trip and wanted my nails to match. The manicurist tried to put other colors on top of the existing color that she just did. I told her that I was not happy with this  and asked her to remove the polish and start over.  She was super sweet and apologized and removed the polish. She said if I wanted it to match 100% that I would have to get the gel and it would cost me extra. I said I shouldn’t be charged extra because their colors did not match up. She did the gel and I was charged an extra $15. I don’t blame my manicurist, she’s the employee.  I do blame the management. I’ve been going to the salon for years and have spent thousands of dollars. They should have provided as a courtesy. Not sure if I will be going back. I’m bummed because I really love my manicurist.<//Text>

Let me start off by saying that I have only gone to Bollinger nail salons for the past 5 years. I usually rotate between Walnut Creek, P-hill and Concord depending where I am running errands that day. I will never return to the Concord location and here's why.....first they called saying I was late to my apt. I booked it for 4:30 and I know that b/c I don't even get off work until 4:00. They had me down for 4:15 but not a big deal. Then I get there and have to wait 15 minutes to be taken back (still not a big deal). I always book 2 girls so the apt doesn't take forever. A lady came out and looked kind of confused and took the girl next to me. They grab me and I noticed I only have 1 girl working on me. I let her know I booked an apt for 2 girls and she doesn't understand me and grabs the girl up front. The girl up front says she has no note saying that, they are fully booked and I will only have 1 girl working on me. I notice the girl that was taken back before me has 2 nail techs so I put it together that they must have grabbed the wrong person. Too late now but it's extremely frustrating to see her leave 30 min before me b/c she had my 2nd nail tech working on her. I ended up cancelling my plans b/c there was no way that I was going to get out of there on time thanks to their mistake. When I go to pay, I let the girl know the situation and she agrees that they made a mistake. I was very much turned off b/c they didn't do ANYTHING to make the situation better. My time is precious and shouldn't be wasted!!!< /text>

Salon does not look like the luxury pics. Not impressed at all with my service. Believe the negative reviews. A basic polish is fine to get here,  anything else ie pedicure scrub, massage, posh salon, don't go here for it.  Pay more for more luxury service<//Review>

HORRIBLE EVERYTHING!! Staff and techs are rude! Tried to make appt two different times and each time had me scheduled wrong. Finally got in for new set and everything I wanted done was done the opposite! Color, length, type........(only due to a gift cert I recvd and wouldnt even think of regiftng!)  WORST PLACE EVER!! I'd rate neg stars if allowed! The staff needs serious customer service courses!!! Along with a Cosmo coarse! Naturally Nails a block over blows Bollinger away! Hands down. Wonderful, comfortable place, ladies are amazing in what they do and pedi is to die for!! New set nails lasted a month! Beautiful job! Thanks Bollinger, now I have the best nail service ever! You should all b ashamed for over charging customers with incompatant /horrible service!!</text>

<review>Worst ever nail experience I've ever had in life.  The establishment is beautiful, however, they should spend more money on equipment and staff and worry about the pretty stuff later.  Wayyyy over priced for horrible service.  I will never go back to this place again.  Took over an hour to do a basic gel fill.< /review><Name>Wilma Van Hook</Name><date>1456438949144<//date></record>

Tried to book an appointment, the person who answered hung up on me then when I called back I got "the computers are already shut off." Apparently this salon doesn't want any business.<//text>

Lawrence W. was very professional while helping me choose the right phone for my needs and was very knowledgeable on the products. Drake J. was also knowledgeable and very professional. He answers all of my questions and took the time to help me understand my new phone and helped me set up my new phone. I really appreciate the time he took to help me with my previous phone. Thank you both for being professional, helpful and for making my experience positive. It was refreshing to have a positive and wonderful customer service experience.<//Text>< Resp>

<Review>I've been to this store three times and it's been a roller coaster ride.  I went in to trade my phone with Royce and he's a really nice guy.  He said that my phone met all the criteria for trade in.  I waited for the new phone to come in before going to bring my old phone in.  When I brought it in, I'm told by Vinny that my old phone doesn't meet the criteria and I'll need to replace the screen of the phone, which was not told to me on my first visit.  At this point, my original phone has been factory reset and I'm using the new phone, so I have to shell out nearly $200 to replace the screen.  I go to bring in the old phone after this and I'm told that since I had originally asked for it to be sent back in via the mail, I can't bring the old phone into the store, which I was never told on my second visit, even though I had told Vinny I had originally asked for it to be shipped.  He made constant reassurances that I could bring it back to the store.  If I had mailed the phone after I had met with Royce, I'm sure I would have gotten nearly nothing for the phone, since it didn't qualify for the promotion, but I had no way to know this.  Working with Vinny was quite challenging.  I never felt welcome and he would continue to give me inaccurate information on both what the phone is worth and what can or can't be fixed on the phone.  I won't be coming back to this location, even if I have problems with the new phone.  I can't trust a word that comes out of their mouths because they were constantly wrong and I'm now hoping the phone makes it in the mail and it doesn't have any other problems that they forgot to mention.  Avoid if you can.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

What an amazing experience with my mom.  They helped us upgrade her phone, switch everything over but went above and beyond with some extra details.  They were patient and kind and made the experience seamless.   I highly recommend this location as not all locations are the same in this area. Our rep was Lawrence Williams.  He was so patient and kind with my mom.  Highly recommend you ask for this young man if you need to head to the location in Goleta.</review>

<username>Kylea Wong</username><time>1622565114318</time><rating>3<//rating><review>So I was doing a trade in of my iphone 6s for a 12 mini. They didn't have the color I wanted so I asked for it to be shipped but for some reason this location said that it doesn't normally have phones shipped to their location ( I think this is weird). I have a PO box so they said they couldn't ship it to me in Santa Barbara, but Royce who was helping me at the time apparently got an exception made for me, which I thought was lovely, and was extremely grateful. BUT, right after he told me he would make an exception for me Royce basically said I HAD to write a google review for him because he was doing me a 'favor.' His words verbatim "you don't have to but you kinda have to." I am a student and I felt like he was taking advantage of me because there was literally nothing I could do to get my phone unless it was shipped to this store. I DO NOT like being coerced into writing good reviews for a service I feel should be provided since my family has been with ATT for over 15 years.

When I went back into the store though I had a different associate named Diana help me and she was absolutely amazing. I didn't feel like she was trying to take advantage of me and would highly recommend getting help from her.<//review>< pictures>

Royce was very helpful, patient, and informative.  Even though I had a difficult time purchasing my iPhone mini online, he listened to my issues and provided good suggestions for solutions.  He also helped me find the best phone plan for my family at the best rate. He is a great example of providing world class customer service< /text>

<name>Brandon<//name><review>Do not go here if you need customer service, there is none. The guy here said he literally cannot help us with anything relating to billing or the account. He did not have any numbers to even call for AT&T customer-no-service. Do not ever use this company even if it's your last choice on earth. Don't expect to ever be able to go into the store to do anything expect set up an account or pay. Literally anything else will redirect you to a 3 hour phone queue.<//review><Date>1619993532108<//Date>< gmapID>

I had a really Pleasant experience  working with Aida. I  had came in looking for new service and I got a new 12 with an unlimited plan. She really knows her stuff and was so patient. I’m surprised and grateful that she took our time with us explaining and making sure we got the best possible program. There was a lot of people waiting in line but she was vary attentive to us and answered all of her questions. Amazing!<//Review>

Drake is one of the best sales representative we have had help and assist us in our telephone upgrade transactions. He is knowledgeable and very efficient. If you need any assistance in any AT&T service, phone upgrades or AT&T TV he is there to assist and make you feel comfortable along the entire process. I am definitely coming back to the AT&T the Goleta Camino Real Shopping Center location.</text>

I was anxious about coming in and turning in my old phones/upgrading to the new ones because I knew it could be a pain/take awhile. But Diana was awesome and made it such a smooth process. She walked me through everything and calmed my nerves about price and helped me with a breakdown of my bill and everything I’d be saving. Super appreciative of Diana’s time and attention today! I will definitely be coming to this location any time I need to go into an AT&T store again.<//text>

< Review>
Drake was awesome, really helpful and knowledgeable. He was friendly and personable and helped us through some really complicated changes without rushing or confusing us. It was a long wait as well even though we had a appointment because it was a busy day, and he was accommodating and efficient. There was another customer who was upset by the wait time and was very rude to us, and was making us feel Uncomfortable, and he spoke to her and asked her to please stop. We really appreciated his attentiveness and dedication to good service and helping us with everything we needed. Never had a better experience at AT&T!</Review>

<Review>My experience was so grate! My husband had to come in to fix his number transfer and I decided to come along to get a new phone. Aida was so amazing she found out that I was paying way to much and ended up switching to first Net service  and getting a phone and free watch and a ipad. Aida Took such good care of us Never had an experience like that before at At&t.</Review>< date>

Need someone that is patient, a problem solver, and to help you find the right AT &T products for you. Look no further, go to the AT&T store in Goleta and ask for Vinny. He was amazing! He opened my business account for my new business. Alsoooo nice eye candy to look at while your wait ;D< /Review>

This team at Goleta is amazing. Their customer service is outstanding. They are patient with everyone, regardless of how tech savvy each customer is. There’s a store closer to me, but I drive here because of this team’s customer service which has remained consistently superior over the years.</text>

<Review>I was extremely disappointed with AT&T service, coverage, and professionalism. I went to AT&T signed up five lines for my business was helped by Courtney. Courtney had given me a price with some promotions. My first two months because of the promotions should’ve  been free. Got a bill in the $400 range the first month. Went and talk to Courtney she said she would fix that  and the next two months would be free I just had to sign up for automatic pay. The next month automatically my account was deducted close to $400 again. Keep in mind my bill should’ve been a little over 200. Called Store Courtney no longer work there and was held by the manager Eric. Eric said he would look into it call me back.I can go on and on about my experience but the short story is five months later I’m paying double what I was quoted in the store. The promotional gift cards they said they would be sending me never showed up. My coverage is awful in Santa Barbara where I live. No one from the store calls me back when they say they will and nothing promised ever came through. I am switching my carriers. I will never come back to ATT. Externally disappointed and wasted so much time coming into the store and over the phone.  Do not trust this store or their employees! I will be complaint all the way up the ranks! I’ve never complained about a business before either but I’ve paid in five months close to 1000 over what I was supposed to pay.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Time>1605979397656< /Time><rate>1<//rate><user_name>Andrea Herz</user_name><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Miguel was the best service I’ve had, I switched over from T Mobile and it’s been great since the start! He’s got my back every time I’m in and he sets the bar above most, hope anyone who goes in gets him! He just gets it done and is honest and spells it all out for you during the transaction. Great service and carrier!<//Review>< Pictures>

I came in with my roommate to look for a phone upgrade and Drake greeted us promptly. He was super informative and detailed with all the questions we had with all the new style of phones. I think I’ll be happy with my new purchase! Thank you so much for your time and patience.< /review>

<Text>Vinny and Laurence were great. They helped me navigate thru technology pieces and contracts. They were incredibly patient with all my confusing questions. I couldn’t have asked for a better experience, not something one usually says when it comes to a phone store. I can’t thank them enough!<//Text>< Rating>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Drake was astonishingly helpful.  I mean astonishingly.  After 20 years with AT&T wireless, I was ready to cancel my account out frustration. I stopped in to the Goleta store today and Drake fixes it all — and more.  He is an excellent listener, understood everything quickly, and worked quickly to get me back up and running!<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Text>Went in to add some phones for the kids on my plan. I was helped by Courtney and she did a great job of showing me an optimized plan that saved me some significant $$. Had an issue eventually with an old # that didn't get closed out that resulted in what I thought was erroneous billing, and we called AT&T for help. Went back in to this location instead and Aida totally took charge and got everything cleared up within 20 minutes!  Cannot give enough stars to this spot, and I will be keeping my business there!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I recently went to the Goleta location and was assisted by Drake, he went above and beyond to help me and my mom activate an account and transfer all of our devices in the easiest way possible. I would highly suggest going to this location, Drake and his entire team will go to great lengths to help with any needs you may have .</Text>

However,  we were very pleasantly surprised thanks to Aida's knowledge, initiative and professionalism. She solved our issue, gave us good information and showed us how to avoid the same problem in the future. We highly recommend visiting the Goleta store. Ask for Aida!<//text>< Pictures>

They're open!!

I didn't know that this location had temporarily closed due to Covid 19. I'm so grateful that they're open and have a very helpful staff! I was able to get the phone my daughter wanted for her birthday.  They also helped me schedule services for my property in a different location. Very helpful staff.</Text>

The Rep Tito has great costumer service skills. He was very friendly and patient with me while I had to get my authorization for the account, & when I finally did,  he knew exactly what I wanted. It was a quick enjoyable experience, which I appreciate. Thank You Tito. 👍🏻</Text>

Aida was amazing I’m an old lady that doesn’t know much about phones and she helped me set my watch and my new apple phone she was kind and patient and I never got this kind of service before while visiting other store her manager Eric was so nice and really took care of me too. They both made sure I understood my bill. Good service I like stopping by to the Goleta store.< /Text>

<review>Went in to get an iPhone and the guy 'helping' me was extremely rude and wasn't even wearing his mask when I walked up. He didn't introduce himeself and completely shut me down without even exploring options to my account asking me to come back tomorrow. I called the customer service line and they explained the service I was asking for could've been done instores. The guy was just being a jerk.< /review><user_id>109514594546308925136< /user_id>< time>

I came into this particular store for assistance with my AT&T store for trouble with my prepaid plan. Erik at the store personal took an hour to make sure that my problem was resolved. I really appreciate him going above and beyond to make sure that my problem was taken care of. I highly recommend coming into this store for assistance with any AT&T products! Thanks again for all your help!< /text>

Horrible attendance by the staff, walked in no one greeted us or wrote our name down on the waiting listed, waited 30 minutes for nothing . They helped another customer who was there after us and ignored us !! DEFINITELY NOT GOING BACK THERE HORRIBLE SERVICE<//text>

<text>Went to purchase a phone outright ( and unlock it) on our AT&T family plan, as a sibling needed a new phone before a trip to europe. Management flat out refused to sell us a device without signing up some sort of payment plan, indicating it was store policy. Told us to go to best buy instead. Called AT&T support where a representative told me no such policy is in place. Also was told they were probably trying to make commission and the only recourse was to visit a different store...It's clear where their priorities lie. Avoid this AT&T store.</text>< rate>

At&t is able to engage in implicit theft via their associated business, directvnow:

If I could give 0 stars, I would. I opened a phone service with at&t back in March 2018, and I unknowingly got some kind of "free trial" with directvnow with it. I had no idea this was signed up under my name, that my bank information was given over to directvnow, and that I would be charged $35 - $40 every month after. I never used this service-- I never even knew how to while I had this account.

It was only after I closed my at&t account (for unrelated reasons) that I finally realized the directvnow charge was actually instigated by at&t. Somehow directvnow cannot locate any account with my information because is now closed-- and yet THEY STILL HAVE MY BANK INFORMATION and I'm STILL BEING CHARGED EVERY MONTH.

After changing my bank card three times-- STILL being charged from directvnow-- I actually have to close my bank account essentially because of unagreed terms and withheld explicit information on the part of at&t.

Essentially, at&t / directvnow stole from me, via bureaucratic technicalities. Seriously, how do you have my bank information for a monthly bill, and yet you cannot locate my account to cancel?

If you are with at&t or signing up, I strongly advise you look at their fine print agreements and your information they share with directvnow. Otherwise you may find yourself under theft every month, and having to close your bank account.<//text>
