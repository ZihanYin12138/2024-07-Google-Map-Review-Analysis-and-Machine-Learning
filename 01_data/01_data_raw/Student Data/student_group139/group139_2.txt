<text>Thank you Ahshia Anderson for your amazing help, I have been looking for a place of security for my mother’s belongings being of age who can’t afford to loose everything. You were so helpful and knowledgeable to any of my concerns. Thank you for your patience with all my questions, and assuring me that Advance Mini storage is the place to come not only for affordability but again security and decent space. Not only is it clean there and looked after. The staff could not have made it anymore of a reason to say yes I’ve found a great spot. Your amazing and I look forward to doing business here and referring others in need of a storage unit. Great Job Ahshia great customer service!!</text>< pictures>

Mary is the most professional, honest and caring employee I have come across while on my search for a Self Storage. I am so grateful to have found Advanced Mini Storage, and even more grateful to know my belongings are safe, and secure. I am so lucky to have been referred, I couldn’t have chose a better place to store my belongings! Thank you Advanced Mini Storage!< /review>

<text>Kristina and Mary are the sweetest things to happen to storage since the disc lock! They do not mind helping tenants with issues. We had never used storage before and after going around to a couple places we were just going to buy a shed because the other locations we visited were so rude. They changed our whole perspective on storage units! Thank you!< /text>< user>

Super fast, super easy, Mary made the process smooth and was very very friendly... She even made my kids feel comfortable, that’s a major plus!!!! No one likes kids and get irritated while trying to do business but when your kids are your life it makes it hard to do any kind of business work but here Mary and Christina made them feel just as important and special... thank you ladies.....<//Review>

This is a great place to be they have a worker there who goes above and beyond, I think her name is Christine, a lil mexican girl, I really love her customer service skills, hope they keep her there, it just feels good when you feel like a person cares about you, not just your money....😇</Text>

Love the staff, the only thing I didn't like is my storage door is a little hard to open lol and the gate closes at 6pm,  which is really early, because by the time I get home from work, its 5:30pm and I have about 20 mins to get there.. I hardly have time to pack and driving there alone, takes 15 minutes. I have to wait til the weekends. I would love to spend time with families or do other errands, besides going to the storage on weekends..</review>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Good storage place. It's July 10 and I just got a house and we don't have to give a 30 day notice but if I need to move out by August I have to let them know when I pay the bill again.
What I like is that I can pay by the 10th of every month or earlier.
Don't have to wait tell the 3rd or the 5th.
We have a 5 by 10 small space and only pay $29 a month.
Very reasonable price. I told my Grandmother she should of came here cause the one she has in Lodi for a 10 by 10 she pays $180 a month.
I told her that this place would of been more cheaper.
I don't know the price but I know it is not $180 for a 10 by 10.
Very nice people and the time is very reasonable too.
They open at 7am close at 5pm the gate closes at 6pm 7 days a week.
I like that cause don't get no late nighters or people crashing there everynight.
Keeps it safe.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1562964393686, 'text': 'Thank you so much Julie for being our customer!'}< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80900c88d892ef4d:0x3db714b7475ed05c<//Gmap_id></record>

Reasonable priceing for the space of the storage units, Amanda was very welcoming in helpful. Got my storage unit same day I called, just a heads up they haven't had insurance since 89 and my unit was broken into within the same month i was there, and i was SOL! I was told there upgrading all there security system in hopefully they will keep there hall way storages more secured.
(P.s get a strong locks circle pad lock) there more expensive but worth it in the long run.< /Text>

New management is ridiculous. Straight up lied about coming back, left for lunch at 3:30 and never came back left us and another customer waiting to sign up and an elderly woman waiting to pay. No one answers the phone, and we've tried both offices.< /Review>

This was my second surgery in the past five years, and both of them have been very pleasant. Dr. Shail M. Vyas Has been a very good doctor to have been in touch with. All that he had told me that he would be doing with the surgery was very informative. So far my recovery is going on great.<//text>

<review>My first encounter with the office was the office staff.  They are very professional yet very friendly.  I instantly felt I was going to the right place to get the care I needed for a fractured shoulder.  I was very concerned that surgery was my only option.  Dr. Vyas assured me that we could take a non-invasive approach and still have a great outcome.  I immediately felt relieved and confident that all would work out.  I was right I am back to normal.  I would highly recommend this practice.

Ultimately, though, knowing it's going to be a long wait is not a problem given the benefits of the doctor.  I just plan accordingly.< /review>< pics>

<text>Great bedside manner, office staff is very polite...wait time very but it’s never been too long...even if you do have to wait, the care you receive from Dr. Vyas and his staff is worth it. Had surgery and this by far is one of the best outcomes I’ve had after surgery. Dr Vyas made no promises but delivered an amazing experience...I’d recommend for all your orthopedic needs.<//text><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

While I seldomly review anything unless it is absolutely deserving and in this case it is. Dr Vyas is one of the hardest-working, most efficient people I have ever met. His talent and knowledge will be forever appreciated by me. Thank you.

*side note: it's mind blowing how nice the office and staff are as well.<//Text>

I am glad to see Dr. Vyas to alleviate my constant shoulder pain which I was suffering for last 7 months secondary to MVA.
He seems very approachable and took time to listen my concerns. His office are equipped x-ray machine, so he could see the results right away and make of decision and plan efficiently.

I had cortisone shot in my shoulder yesterday to help with rotator cuff discomfort.  I decided to not have surgery until this virus is settled down. Dr. Vyas was so gentle and I didn't feel a thing.  He takes his time with you and explains everything very well.</Review>

<review>TSApre check application office. Do not use the airport! These guys are Blazing fast. A model of efficiency.

<Rate>4<//Rate><Review>Generally, the appointment went well. I went in on a Saturdsy morning. I went into the office where my information was brought up on the computer. I presented my IDs, took fingerprints, then waited for the process to be completed. I was reminded at least 4 times that I now owe $80. A bit excessive. The gal doing the processing seemed pretty bored, but it was completed in less than 15 minutes.<//Review>< pictures>

I had my appointment and arrived early by about 30 minutes, since I did take the VTA light rail to get there. Since my son accompanied me (and we didn't plan for it and hence no appointment for him), they treated him as walk-in. The receptionist asked me to have his name in the sign-in sheet just below mine and gave me the usual 30min-3hr wait spiel for walk-ins. However, we both got called 15m early and the agent (Cassandra) in there, was super helpful. She had my son application done online on my phone and got the procedure done in about 10 min for both of us. She even pointed me out to couple of lunch places around the joint. It was smooth and I'd recommend this place - but go with an appointment.

(on a different issue, faced a nightmare at the VTA LRT station on our return, with a crazy guy going off rails!)</review>

Had a noon appointment for a TSA pre identity check, walked in and the waiting area was crowded. I waited maybe 60 seconds until I was greeted by a friendly staff member, who took me to a private office for document and fingerprint scanning. With small talk and pleasantries, took about 7 minutes. Paid with a credit card. The DMV could learn a few things here.</Text>

Reception staff is nice enough, but it seems the office staff is full of self important slackers and imbisoles.  They can't serve you because there are so many "meetings" where one fat guy walks into another fat guys office and starts chuming it up, cussing, and talking crap about other employees followed by closing the door.  The receptionist picks right up on it and says "they're in a meeting" then employees departing the company are waiting for them to turn in uniforms etc.  What a complete sh show.

At least they have a snack.machine, free coffee and tea, and decent chairs in the waiting room.

Most insecure security company ever.  If you want a uniform they are near the snack machine that is publicly accessable.</Text>

<review>Great park to take the family to. Baseball, basketball, running, you can do it all. There's a playground, a bathroom, and a sidewalk track around the field that's great for walking. I play softball here every Sunday and I'm glad the grass is always watered.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
Been going here for over 4 years now with my sons. Best barbershop I found to cut my sons hair correctly. My boys are mixed with black so there hair texture requires a different set of skills to make it come out the way I like and Herms has them. I’m afraid to go anywhere else now 💯< /Review>

<review>Besides today, the last time I was there was about a year ago.
Now I remember why I don't go there.

1. When I walked in, it was EXTREMELY loud in there.
They had the volume on the television and/or the stereo really loud, and had to basically shout at each other to be heard over the music.
Apparently nobody there has the common sense to lower the volume, so you don't have to yell at each other to be heard.

2. They said the wait time on both occasions was between 1 1/2 to 2 hours for a haircut.

3. Both times I was there, most of the barbers were either on their phones or having lengthy conversations with one another or the clients. Very little hair cutting was taking place, which helps explain the 1 1/2 - 2 hour wait times.

Perhaps I may return again next year.
Maybe they will have improved by then....< /review></record>

Your going to wait an hour or more siting if your a walk in. Also a lot of barbers will be cutting the same side of some guys for an hour. Thier a sign that you can't smoke or smell of weed, but some of thier random friends will come in drinking.

Edit: also keep in mind to all the five stars are from friends and family, or they payed they to give them five stars.<//review>

Haven't had a bad experience so far. The staff is nice. I would recommend making an appointment with the barbers before going.
You would have to ask them for their info.<//Text>

< Review>
Great place if you want to waste time! I waited for 2 hours while I watched them skip me just to do their friends haircut first. They're always talking and always on their phones. Plus bad service. After the two hours I went to The BlackBoard Barbershop where I got taken in almost immediately and made my $20 very worth it because they did a great job using other materials like a hot towel that I never heard of and don't know the uses for them but it felt good and relaxing. I'm not saying to go here I'm just saying it's WAY better than herms.</Review>

I've waited 45 minutes and watched 6 people walk right up for a haircut. I'm sure some have appointments. The place looks busy, but the 45 wait when my name is next since my arrival seems excessive. It's now close to 60 minutes, my name remains as next, but being next doesn't seem to mean much as others continue to walk up and go straight to a barber chair. 12 people have walked up, one man informed me he had no appointment but was called ahead of me. They don't look at who has signed in.<//text>

They are some good barbers here but the wait is terrible. To make an appointment you have to go inn. And it smells like weed. They all look like they are stoned to the stars. The owner seems to not have control of this place and I'll just take my coins somewhere else.</text>

Good customer on any kind of boys to gentlemen. I am sure herm's barber shop helps ladies too. By the way, herm's barber shop truly respect gentlmen when their hairs got cut so nicely. Know why? I sometimes notice when i was at laundromat. Know that is sometimes noise, steal, and loudly chat that sometimes guide to know other businesses supportive. Herm's barber shop is truly helping and provding good hairs on gentlemen including ladies.</Review>

<userid>104589973157535455857<//userid><Text>Came here this past Sunday.
Place was unprofessional.
I walked in, and it reeked like weed, and the music blasting on the speakers made it feel like I was at a Forever 21.
There were about six barbers that day, and two of them are complete nutjobs. Obviously one of them was the one playing the music.
Those two spent more time joking about tattoos, pop singers, and celebrities than they did cutting.
One of their homies walks in, and they instantly sit him down, and they completely forget that there were 10 other paying customers.
You might say it's okay if he had an appointment, but it was obvious that he didn't have an appointment by the way he walked in and they just sat him down.
It's like working at a Walmart, and letting one of your friends cut the line simply because they're your friends.
They tell you to take a slip with a number on it, but they don't even use it. Instead they just scream, "WHO IS NEXT!?", when they're done, like you're at some prison waiting to get a buzz.
Got my cut from one of the few chill barbers employed barbers, but, wasn't too impressed.
Can't believe a slummy barber shop thinks it can charge $15, and up to $30 for an appointment haircut and edge up.
Come get your cut here if you're under 15, listen Drake, wear skinny jeans, and smoke weed. Avoid this place if you're over 18, have a brain, and expect professionalism because you sure won't find it here.< /Text>< Response>

<review>A great barbershop, if i dont feel like waiting an hour or two cause its after school hours or a friday or the weekend then i just might as well go to Latinos @ mercado latino-theyll attend me in 15min tops. Only because Herms can take a while especially because they tend to be on their phones and talk a lot so that takes up a lot of time. Overall it can be worth the wait.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

My son and I waited for 1.5 hours with about 5 other customers. There were 7 barbers that cut hair very slowly. I was next for at least 30 minutes. Went straight to Supercuts and waited 15 minutes and they only had 3 stylists with 6 customers. Cash me ousside, how bout dah?!< /review>

Today I had a terrible experience at Vancouver's consulate, the same document my husband did in Los Angeles last week, which I tipped one document for my husband and exactly  the same for me to get AFP funds in Chile. In LA cost him US$5  and it was ready in 1 day but in Vancouver cost me US$35 ($47 Canadienses) and it was ready in one week. I was so upset! ... I congratulate this team, for me it is always easy to communicate (by email) and the documents are always on time.<//review>

I have received the worst service from the people that work there. There are rude and non professional. In addition they don’t do things properly the first time. Many friends have had the same experience and this is why I am speaking out. If you have experienced the same write a complain in the Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores. This mistreatment has to stop! We deserve to be treated with courtesy and respect!
I must add that I found out my identification card (célula de identidad) which they renewed and mail to me in November, was not activated. I found out the hard way a couple weeks ago (March) after I had to use it for a transaction! There incompetence is beyond my understanding. Another complain was posted in the Ministerio de Relaciones Exterior. Hopefully they will do something about it. It’s time! 😡< /text>

Please use this email to make appointments.  Also be clear to what your needs are. Appointments get book up quickly.  Bathrooms are close by and the consulate is on the 5th floor. I learned the hard way.<//Review>

<Time>1590776417891< /Time><rating>1<//rating><Review>Today my son headed to the consulate to renew his passport. Unfortunately he didn't know he was supposed to make an appointment, since Covid19 hit us. Despite of it, they did accept his application (since as always, they didn't have anyone on the waiting room)
As expected he was treated poorly by on of their employees. Making him feel like at home. What is it gonna take for them to treat their fellow chilean citizens better.
Shame on them< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>Where ever the place you can go, you will be welcome better then here !
Those completely unuseful people will give strictly 0 advice and will help you in any way !
They act as you are disturbing them during their such busy day, overbooked with nothing...
I used to travel around the world, always been welcomed and helped in the different consulate I went.  It's the worse I ever been.
Those people are just a shame for Chile.
I put 1 star cause I couldn't put 0.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80c2b93c67dd4e9b:0x7072fba31fa38427</gmap_id></record>

<Text>Rudest girls, without Service voluntarily. They forget that's Chilean government who's paying her salaries for they help to Chileans residents in USA. This it regular comment between chileans when they come back from there. When some service is required them answer rudely or simply treat us like idiots. I hope that this review may see it some manager from Chilean Embassy, because it's so bully make a question and recieve back answers like that.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< rating>

Truly an awful experience. The website instructions are wrong, and it was very difficult to get in touch with anyone via phone to get the instructions and the forms. The background check from the FBI must be less than three months old, and if not you will have to get another one. The online form will not accept a large and odd range of words and characters, from the word "and" to a "/." If you enter any of the forbidden characters, it will delete the entire form and log you out. The consulate staff does not tell you this unless you email back about the form not accepting your information.

The pictures I sent in were wrong (which was probably my own fault) but they were very rude in demanding that I have new passport photos taken. The original fee for the student visa was $140, which I submitted with my original application in early July. When I called in mid-August to make sure my application was complete, I was told that it was. I was then called a week later and informed that the fee had changed on July 1 to $160 and that I must send $20 more. I did, the following business day, then sent an email saying the money was on its way. Two days later I received a very angry phone call from the woman who works at the consulate demanding to know where the money was. I explained to her that I had already emailed and the money should arrive the next day. She hung up on me.

FINALLY, one week before I was due to leave for Chile, I receive an email from her saying my visa is ready for me to pick up on Monday in Los Angeles. This was on a Thursday, and I live in Colorado and was planning to fly to LA the following Wednesday. She told me I'd have to change my flight because the consulate does not give out visas on Tuesdays or Thursdays. I cried the whole day, positive that I would have to cancel my whole semester abroad. Fortunately, my father managed to call her and convince her to give me an appointment for Friday morning.

Picking up my visa took LESS THAN five minutes! And she wanted me to spend hundreds of dollars changing my flight.

Sorry for writing a novel...
Point being: Getting a visa will be a royal pain. It is expensive and the bureaucracy is unbelievable. The staff is rude and difficult to reach. I never want to leave the country for more than 90 days ever again.</Text>

Very bad experience , i lost a day of work taking my daughter to L.A. from San Diego and she lost a day of school. Then i get there and they say she needs a parent letter because she is under age. First , waste of time, second very bad service because they are very rude, and many days before when i called to make an appointment they should have asked if my daughter was under age.<//Text>

<review>BUROCRATIC, INEFFICIENT, CARELESS, UNPROFESSIONAL
Not only one but many bad experiences, traveling several hours to get there and I had gotten a terrible service! wasted my time and gas because they game the wrong info on the phone and the something was missing " sorry we can't do it you got to come again..", giving the run around instead of finding a way to help, with their attitudes like they are doing you a huge favor
Their schedule is so bad, only few hours/week
Their Consul doesn't returned his calls or voice messages, even when is an important matter to the person calling, leaving several messages and email, nothing.
Who are these people there to serve? What are they pay for??
A Consulate is suppose to be in a city/area to SERVE the community/ Country they represent. NOT this one for sure! Shame on you Chilean Consulate.
Anybody reads these reviews???<//review><gmap_id>0x80c2b93c67dd4e9b:0x7072fba31fa38427<//gmap_id><date>1375042475427< /date>< Rate>

They serve until 1:30 pm right? Just thinking that I have to go to the Consulate stressed me out, it is necessary that they answer the phone
We need information on the documents that we have to bring so that we do not lack anything to be able to successfully carry out what we require.

Atienden hasta la 1:30 pm verdad ? De solo pensar que tengo que ir al Consulado me estresó, es necesario que contesten el phone
Necesitamos información de los documentos que tenemos que llevar para que no nos falte nada para poder realizar con éxito lo que requerimos.<//text>< Pics>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Terrible attitude on the part of the employees, always with a rough and reluctant attitude in particular women ... MARIA FERNANDA AND SOLEDAD ARE THE WORST PUBLIC WORKERS THAT CAN EXIST ... never answer the phone and always complicate everything, sometimes they even act based on nothing legal but by its own wrong and inefficient criteria.

It also turns out that they lose the internet connection every simple week and according to them they don't come back in days ... Everything seems like a pretext not to work and earn their salary doing as little as possible, when I called days later they came out with me that there was a system but that I had to go before 11 in the morning because they were based on Chile's schedule ... what? That is totally false ... I personally was there with a relative doing the same procedure around 1pm ... I was calling from 9am and they never answered until after 11:30 and they gave me that answer ... TERRIBLE! !!

Ademas resulta que pierden la conexion a internet cada simple semana y segun Ellas no vuelve en dias... Todo parece un pretexto para no trabajar y ganar su sueldo haciendo lo menos posible, cuando llamé dias despues me salieron con que sí habia sistema pero q tenia q ir antes de las 11 de la mañana por q se basaban en el horario de Chile... what? Eso es totalmente falso...  yo personalmente estuve ahi con un familiar haciendo el mismo tramite alrededor de las 1pm... estuve llamando  desde las 9am y nunca contestaron hasta despues de las 11:30 y me dieron esa respuesta...TERRIBLE!!!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Do not carry your passport, they ask me to go to the police to report as lost, I tell them it is not lost, they told me that I only needed the ID. They respond to me, I do not see it, you report it. I go to the police, I tell them the truth, I call in front of a police officer and he tells me we never said that. Liars, slow, lazy, disrespectful. They leave the office and leave one waiting. They work like 5 hours and it seems that they are tired. Pity the attention.

<resp>None< /resp><text>(Translated by Google) I'm Angelo Durán and the anecdotes have been repeated with the officials of this consulate. The ladies, Fernanda Romero and Soledad López, I think it's called, have a hostile and burlesque attitude towards the Chilean citizens that we are going to do paperwork. This complaint does not go to the consul, whom I do not know personally and who is probably not on this side of the glass with us listening to the crickets. I went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Santiago and they were not at all surprised with my comments and they gave me a form to leave a formal complaint. The consulate is a piece of Chile for those who live abroad and should be a pleasant and hospitable place. I hope that the consul will read this comment and start investigating through surveys what people think of the service. I no longer live in the United States but I feel sorry for the compatriots who have to deal with these people every time they have to do a paperwork.

Fui al Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores en Santiago y no estaban para nada sorprendidos con mis comentarios y me entregaron un formulario para dejar una queja formal. El consulado es un pedacito de Chile para quienes vivimos en el extranjero y debería ser un lugar grato y hospitalario. Espero que en cónsul lea este comentario y comience a investigar a través de encuestas a qué opina la gente del servicio.

<Text>(Translated by Google) Today I renewed my card and signed a power of attorney at the consulate. Arrange the details before you travel. Phone calls and emails were answered in a timely manner with useful information. I was attended by officials Alonso Flores and Fernanda Romero in a professional and efficient manner. Everything was ready. The process took an hour, including the payment of fees - very cheap - and the purchase of a FedEx envelope to send me the card. The building is modern and elegant, the waiting room adequate and there is parking nearby at prices from US9 to US25, in the basement of the same building. I consider my experience as positive and at the level of the best. It is interesting to read the enormous differences of opinion regarding the attention of the driver.

<text>(Translated by Google) 2 weeks ago I am calling the number that appears here and they never answer, you cannot leave a message because the answering machine says that it cannot receive more messages, that is, it is full!

The same with the 24th extension of Mrs. Maria Fernanda Romero, she does not answer either and cannot leave a message. And worst of all, it is impossible to understand the voice that suggests sending an email to MFROMERO @ ????

Terrible service, the same goes for the Chilean Consulate in Mexico City. Nobody answers!!

Tratar de que contesten una llamada es una proeza, estuve por casi dos semanas llamando a ese consulado y nadie contestaba las llamas, por fin despues de intentar por dos semanas  de llamar y enviar emails alguien contesto y de mala manera. Quisiera saber que tipo de empleados trabaja en un consulado de un pais en vias al desarrollo y mas aun pagados por todos los chilenos.<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>If your looking for awesome, honest and flexible deals?, stop looking and give Corona Motors in Ontario,Ca a call!
We did just that yesterday and they were able to put us in this awesome 2012 Ford F-350 Diesel!
We needed a second truck for our growing business. Thanks to Amir and Mike for making it possible and going above and beyond with their customer service!
Definitely recommend!👍🏼👏⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️➕< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80c333c801293f79:0xee56c9d49e526c02</gmapID></record>

I’ve been here a couple of times and those both times my family and myself were helped quickly and were treated with respect. Best service I’ve had in a while and everyone was super helpful. Amir is really there to help you out!!! Super friendly guy!!! My family and I are very happy with our purchase and we’ll continue purchasing at Corona Motors!!<//text>

I have Super Challenging Credit due to my tenure with Uber which I quit in 2017 after 4.5 years of driving for them. I had an accident and was out of work for quite some time which caused my credit to take a BEATING!!! I tried for a couple of weeks to get financed for a vehicle but kept getting denied. I went to Corona Motors as a last alternative.

The salesman named Amir was not only able to get m e financed, but was able to get me into the vehicle I WANTED. Amir really went to bat for me and got me approved in less than 24 hours and for the vehicle I wanted. Amir is "The Man!" I really appreciate ALL the hard work he put into getting me approved.

If you have challenging credit, go to Corona Motors and see Amir FIRST! Don't waste your time at other dealerships that make promises and FAIL. Amir DID NOT give em a Promise. He gave me a GUARANTEE that he will get me financed and was true to his word. Honestly, there is no excuse for going anywhere else other than Corona Motors. Amir WILL work HARD and Get You APPROVED!!!!!</Text>

When we got in to talk numbers he was so informative, seeing as we only bought one other vehicle. Was able to get us the payments we wanted. Going home with a very ecstatic husband! Truck was spotless and clean on inside and out!
Thank you so much!</Review>< pictures>

Just purchased our 2nd car from Amir and it couldn’t have been smoother. Although this time was a little different with masks and all we were in and out in less then an hour. Highly recommend Corona Motors to all in need of a reliable used vehicle.

If your in the Ontario area and need a great place with lots of selection, check these guys out. Amir was very helpful and pleasant to work with. He was very honest and upfront with me throughout the entire transaction.I did NOT feel like I was being taken advantage of like most dealerships do. Overall great experience and I will come back in the future.</Review>

I had an extremely pleasant experience with shopping for a newer truck with this company, Amir was absolutely fantastic on helping me through with my very first financed truck answered any and all of my questions I had. without any pressure to purchase, I will absolutely be coming here again for my next purchase without hesitation, the 2006 f350 they sold me is in fantastic condition.
THANK YOU!!

Update -  One Payment 6 weeks and 3234 miles later iv had to had my truck towed home today, iv already replaced one sensor on the truck which seemed to help, but after shutting the truck off to get fuel this morning it refused to start.  (I do not blame the dealer directly) I just wish I would of brought a certified mechanic with me to properly look it over before purchase, You always take a risk purchasing something that has 167k miles on it and I am definitely eating this one. Have your cars checked by someone qualified before you sign on that line.<//Review>

When it comes to cars, I simply won’t go anywhere else. Ask for Amir. He made my car buying experience the best yet. The friends I refer to him always come back with glowing reviews. The folks at Corona Motors are not only absolute wizards — they take the time to kindly walk you through the whole process. They’re the best people I have encountered working in car sales!<//review>

Amir was a very nice dude and had great customer service, but sold us a truck with no maintenance  done on it. Looks good on the surface but it’s just to get a quick sale. Not even a month into owning our truck we did the brakes and there was no brake left on the pad AT ALL! They never did a simple freaking oil change. There wasn’t even a cabin air filter in the vehicle! We still have not received anything in the mail for the truck. No tags or license plate. We call and they refuse to give us straight answers about it all. If you’re going to cheat the system and not do the maintenance at least be honest about it so it can get done.<//text>

<Text>I dealt with AMIR and EUNIS -Excellent excellent excellent  customer service and thoughtfulness of my time and energy. They made sure everything in the vehicle was functioning properly and even delivered it to my home an hour away. Everyone was very responsive and polite. They even mailed spare keys that they found in their records to me after the fact. I most definitely would recommend and suggest dealing with corona motors. My Ford F150 is absolutely immaculate. They are very patient and answer all questions and made me very comfortable.</Text><Name>Chris Smith<//Name><Resp>None<//Resp>< rate>

Amir was extremely precessional and friendly. He showed my wife and I the truck we were looking for and test drive it. Amir wasn’t The usual pushy used car salesman but allowed us to take our time. Ounce we got to the finance part, he worked a great strategy deal that we could afford. We are very happy with our purchase and look forward to many RV adventures with our new F250 diesel truck.

Thanks Amir for making this an awesome experience.<//Review>

I was with a friend while he was purchasing a vehicle and the service was wonderful during the wait time. One of the salesman named amir offered complimentary coffee, water, and let me charge my phone. I would definitely recommend this place to someone who needs a car asap.< /review>

This company is a class act. I called them about a car I saw online. When I came down to the dealership, they didn't try to up sell me at all. It was for the exact same price that they listed online. I was in and out within an hour or so. Thanks.< /text>

Hello everybody out there looking for a vehicle,
Corona motors is the place to go!!!I just recently had my motor go in my work truck and needed another truck right away but I only had so much to work with for my down payment And what I could afford monthly. I called and spoke with Adrian and some of his associates ( sorry if I forgot your names) agreed to meet later that day (with Adrian)anyway long story short I got the truck I wanted at a great rate and a payment lower than I had expected, there’s was no haggling what so ever basically told them what I had and about what I can afford and WOW!!!!! They exceeded my expectations. The staff there is awesome I highly recommend anyone looking for a used vehicle to go there.     Thank guys!!!!<//review>

There is no better car buying experience. Amir is as knowledgable and friendly as they come, and treats you like his own family. I've had nothing but positive things to say about my entire experience there, from finding the right car, to financing, to taking delivery, the guys at Corona Motors are dedicated to your needs. I've recommended all of my friends and family who are in need of a car to give them a call or visit them before anyone else. Thank you guys!</review>

<text>I purchased a 2008 F250 super duty 5 months ago. I had some what I thought were small problems with it from the beginning. Come to find out they were part of much bigger problems. The twin turbo is bad and the possibility of needing a new engine is most likely.  Ford made the 6.4 model's for only a short time because they are not a good truck. So I have had this thing for 5 months and need to put $26,000 into it just to have more problems later. That is what I am being advised by the several mechanics I have spoke to. I called to talk to the owners of this dealership and all I got was sorry there is nothing we can do for you. Even though I have records of the truck having these problems from the beginning. I am now stuck paying off a $19,000 loan and I have no vehicle to drive. Looks like my only options are take the hit or file bankruptcy.  Unfortunately from my experience with this dealership,  I would tell people to run away!! DO NOT BUY  ANY VEHICLE FROM THESE PEOPLE!!! All they will do I rob you and put you in debt.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Amir was the most honest and patient person, especially with me beingcbeing so distraught.  5days after purchase with some concerns and he took care of all of it.  Fixed everything and went above and beyond for me.  Mike spoke to me very calmly, which I clearly needed because I was concerned buying a 2016 higher miles I didn't understand but they.
made sure everything was taken care of.  I love my new car and I definitely recommend coming back for anyone or myself.  Thank you Amir for your integrity and patience and Mike for a good deal with everything worked out !<//text>

My 3rd purchase from Corona Motors. My first was in 2001 and Mike the General manager who just helped me purchase my third car assisted me in financing my first car 20 years ago! Delivered as promised and I am beyond happy with my new suv. I recommend to all in the area looking for a reliable used vehicle!

No words I swear. Against all odds these guys were able to make the impossible possible . As a first time buyer I’m now I’m dipping a 2015 Sonata From a 2002 Explorer. Ask for Amir he’s the man that will make it happen!

Thank you guys 👍🏽</review>

<pics>None< /pics><review>Was looking for a car for about a month. First moment I spoke to someone at Corona Motors was when I found my perfect car. I spoke to someone named Amir and he helped me find the right car for my family and I. Even during the COVID restrictions, I was able to have all my
questions answered and was able to go in and leave with the car without any hassles.

I highly recommend you shop here. Call and speak to Amir and he will give you all the details you need in order for you to make a decision. Excellent professional service that I highly recommend!< /review>< Resp>

Don’t inquire for a vehicle or apply for credit check online ! These guys will run your credit for a vehicle then sell it before they even process your credit report therefore dinging your credit and wasting your time . They will even promise you another vehicle then sell that one too. I should of believed the reviews when I read them .this place does not run a professional business, if I could I would give it 10 negative stars . A WORD TO THE WISE SHOP ELSEWHERE!!!!!!!!!!!!   BUYERS BEWARE!!!!< /Text>

As customer service is our #1 goal here at Corona Motors, we’re not able to put any cars on hold because its simply not fair to other prospective buyers and we would never keep someones deposit for simply changing their mind. Since 1999 we have been working on a first come first serve basis and we always make sure our clients are aware of this rule.\n\nI understand your frustration as you have been in the market since November of last year (at least thats when you first contacted us).\xa0\xa0It has now been over 6 months and you haven’t made a single trip down to physically check out our inventory of diesel trucks, yet get mad when the “perfect truck” of yours gets sold days after we ran your credit.\n\nPer our conversation the other day and as promised, we purchased three new diesel trucks for you to choose from and would love to assist you. Just be quick as they will not last long on our lot.\n\nThanks,\nManagement'}< /Resp>< GmapID>

Definitely an interesting experience, Allan was delightfully friendly and incredibly helpful. We spent nearly 5 hours there and he made every second of our experience a memorable one. Would definitely recommend visiting this location if you're looking for warm, friendly staff. The car selection is a bit small but you'll definitely find something for everyone.< /Review>

<text>So lets start at the beginning,  I talked about a couple truck there and the gentleman on the phone was very helpful on what was available and details on them and what was already sold. We went down there to look at a truck but it wasn't quite what we were looking for. So Amir told me they would be getting in somemore soon. We keep in touch and also checked their website and found two that would work for us so we made another trip and finally picked out a nice truck that fit what were looking to do with it(slide in camper). They even took truck to upholstery shop to replace leather on arm rest. So the check engine light came on and they called me before we were to pick it up, they took it to repair shop and the turbo was replaced. We finally picked it up and we are extremely pleased with truck and all the staff at Corona motors. Its very rare to find honest car dealerships anymore. If you looking for a good truck or car you need to check this dealership first. Thank you Amir.< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOOokrQ-aml9h2kr-Zy559YF3LHZfGBkWFHUl-Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Response>

Please see Krista's review below I am in the EXACT same situation. I bought a vehicle from them in January, and traded in a vehicle, which they agreed to pay the loan off on. It has been 2 months and they still have not paid off my trade-in. I have called at least 10 times, they have sent me 2 checks to make the payments (how unprofessional). This is absolutely ridiculous. I have left many messages and spoken with several people and I am always told "We will call you back in 30 minutes." Then I do not hear from them. While I love my current vehicle all of this other nonsense is maddening. My next move is to pursue legal action if this is not handled promptly. CALL ME BACK.</review>

<name>Victoria Buniff<//name><Pics>None<//Pics><review>My fiancée had been looking for a low mileage diesel engine 2500 truck. He saw Corona Motors on Facebook had a larger  2009 F350 with low miles, great condition and few prior owners.  Price had been lowered for 4th of July weekend, internet or FB special  and it was within range of his down payment.  Amir was the sales representative and answered his phone call over the weekend.  He said he could have the first look appt. on Monday 07/06,  he drove and  liked the truck and decided to purchase.  Amir was professional, attentive and answered both his and all my  questions and did not push his decision making process.  Amir completed and explained all the paperwork in simple, easy to understand language.  The finance man Mike, worked like a trooper to get him financed with a payment below what he expected to pay.  He was even able to get extended warranty coverage. We are pleased with the service and his purchase from Corona Motors.  Thank you Amir and Mike for your above and beyond service.< /review>< Rate>

<text>They lied on interest rate to get me there, said theyd fix the issues w the truck once I bought it.    I've almost died 2 times now because they won't do the repair!   Or call me back.  I've made 1 payment....     I called it In w less than  the 250 miles  cut off too....  They arent honorable ppl...  Shady at best.    The owners or older guys are the shot callers.  They are cheap and dodge responsibility.   It's going to get myself or others killed.<//text>< gmap_id>

Quick and easy service, were in and out with the car in an hour. Super friendly salesman Sam and manager Arman. We went to several big name dealerships to find used cars and had the worst possible experiences. These guys were super personable and friendly and no hassle at all. Overall had a much nicer experience than most car dealerships.< /Review>

<Text>It was definitely a great experience working with Doug and Arman when purchasing the 2012 Jeep Liberty Sport. They were both very pleasant and worked in a timely manner to get us through the car buying process. The next time I'm in the market for buying another used car, I will most certainly go back to Corona Motors due to their honesty and integrity! Doug and Arman you're the BEST!!!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

I have been trying to get them to pay off my old car loan since Dec. 27th and they will not. I have talked with them on the phone, even gone down there because they had to reimburse me for payment twice. If they do no pay off the car by the 16th, the payment will be missed and will thus affect my credit. When that happens, I will move forward legally and sue for damages. I never have left a negative review for ANYTHING EVER. They seem completely disorganized and unprofessional. I hope by posting this whoever has been responsing to reviews (which was as early as this week) will know how SERIOUS I am.< /text>

Their car's are no good at all DO NOT FALL for the Carfax banners. They will lie to you and lie to the banks about the contract. Once you sign the contract and you have car issues they will try hard to avoid the problem. They have alot of engine problems with all their car's. It's  crazy how the check engine light does not come on with all the issues they have 🤔. If I am able to give Zero stars that's would be my Rate for the Dealership, Car's and Staff.<//review>

< review>
I've been searching for a long time for a car. I've been to countless dealerships, and I have pretty sad credit. I've been told that there was no way I was going to get a car within the price range I wanted at the payment I wanted. Well, here at Corona Motors, Doug made it happen.

Doug was quick and efficient from the start showing us only what had the amenities we wanted in a price range he felt would give us the payment we wanted. To tell the truth, I fell in love with the red Nissan Rogue the moment I first sat down in it, and a test drive only cemented my love. That was my car. To my absolute joy, Doug worked with us and kept up on finance to get us off the lot in that beautiful Nissan Rogue.

It really was a wonderful experience, and Doug made it super easy for someone like me who was new to car buying. I am so proud to have finally financed a car all on my own. Thanks, Doug!< /review>

<review>They are amazing. I had a really bad credit score back a couple months ago and they were the only dealership that approved me and worked about a week to do it and I got my dream car from them and it's feels and looks brand new, even helped when I need to get a new battery. Everyone there is so friendly and they do have a big selection. I was surprised when they had the one I wanted at an amazing deal. Highly recommended.< /review><username>Kayla Munday<//username><userid>118037261316738990433< /userid><gmapID>0x80c333c801293f79:0xee56c9d49e526c02< /gmapID><Resp>None< /Resp>< rating>

<Text>I was a little apprehensive at first and I asked a LOT of questions about the 2013 Mazda 3 before I bought it.

I noticed that the driver seat belt was pretty messed up and the back tires were cupping pretty bad. I told my sales associate Bill about it and they hooked it up with 4 brand new tires and an OEM Mazda Seat Belt.

I also checked and the fluids were all topped off and the oil's consistency looked like it just had a fresh oil change. I would recommend checking these things before buying any used car.

They tried hard to get me into a car right away and they were able to get me a loan with a really decent APR even though I had a bankruptcy and repo on my record.

If your credit is in bad shape, I would recommend coming to these guys. They'll do everything they can to get you into a car that you want. If you find any issues with the vehicle just tell them about it and they'd more than happy to help.</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvuFJEM6wjVKRvgahgzQaR6DC4os4RgUqcckZa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< response>

I went to buy a car the other day and I noticed touch up paint on most of the cars. Had a mechanic inspect a car I was interested in, and found electrical issues. I told them about it, and was even insulted. One of the salesmen even told me "do you want to take this outside?" When we actually we're standing outside. What a moron!! Don't do business here! Super unprofessional, and ghetto!</Text>

This Dealer is horrible..some of their reviews are fake they were done by themselves...they sold me a Chrysler 300 that wouldn't pass smog ,they took it to a shop that passed the car for them and then they put it on the lot and reset the car settings with a dead battery. Called them out about it and  they had all kinds of excuses either way i learned my lesson never buy from a ghetto dealer ...and No i do not recommend this dealer your better of going to craigslist</Review>

The guys at Corona Motors sold me a diesel truck in July 2012. I was new to Diesel engines and when I saw it smoking they told me it was normal for a diesel. I believed them because it made sense. But I've now been told by numerous diesel guys that this is not normal. So I took it to a couple shops. They've told me that all 8 injectors are bad. They don't all go bad suddenly so there's no way that Corona Motors didn't know there was a problem and they even somehow managed to get it smogged. I'm being told now that it couldn't possibly have passed inspection with it smoking this bad. DON'T GO THERE. THEY LIE AND CHEAT.< /review>

Where do I even begin with this place? Their cars will literally break down days after buying a car. They DO NOT help you and they never know what's wrong with it , they always say "I'm not a mechanic so I don't know what to tell you". Skip this place if you're interested in getting a car that ACTUALLY RUNS! Yes they have beautiful cars, but THEY DO NOT WORK! They only offer a 30 day warranty because they know their cars are GARBAGE! It's a huge headache getting a car from them. I TRULY regret getting a car from them because the cost in repairs for my car is $2,800-$5,000+! So think before coming here, you are adding a car payment to your monthly bills, DO YOU REALLY WANT TO ADD THOUSANDS MORE TO GET THAT SAME CAR FIXED?!? PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE!<//Review>

Service is bad, outrageously unprofessional, cars have multiple problems, horrible customer service. I was sold a lemon and when taken the car back due to having more than several problems, the owner, Mike, decided to take my car for a joy ride a couple of days after getting it back from their mechanics and he got multiple toll rode violations in my car. I had the car less than five months of purchase and was already almost $800 deep in repairs and that was just the start of the repairs. I cannot believe this business, they have lost all my business and I hope you find a better used car dealership before even considering going to corona motors.< /Text>

<Time>1343686220372</Time><rating>5<//rating><Text>I certainly appreciated the assistance and help I received when I visited the Corona Motors lot to look for a car. Before we got into looking at cars the gentlemen that helped me ... Amir Jafari ... went over my financial situation and pre approved me with a car that I knew I could afford. It was important for him to give me a car I can afford so as to now struggle anymore than I have in the past.

During the process of finding said car Amir was very patient in my selection process and when I did find something I liked he showed me the carfax (without me even asking for it)

The whole process was rather nice and went smoothly. I would definitely get another car from them and would certainly recommend others doing the same.<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Terrible service! From the beginning they treat you very well so that you buy, I bought a truck and it came out defective, they are only taking me long to fix it, more than 3 weeks with the truck parked and they only say I speak to you, they do not speak to me I have to go talking to them. Normally you buy a vehicle to use it, in my case no, 3 weeks with the truck if I have driven it 2 times is a lot, his mechanic has been saying that the part does not arrive, when the part is sold in Autozone, you do not even need to order because they have it in stock. In addition, it is not the only problem that the truck has (it is throwing oil and water), it is more than obvious that they did not check it and they solved the problems it had before putting it on sale, with the folder and the truck looking clean enough. For them, I personally lack professional ethics that they only care about selling and not about the well-being of their clients. I already made my first payment, because as I say to the finance company I am not going to give you the payment because the truck cannot handle it, it can't be true. Caution !! before buying, better take your mechanics before because later this becomes a headache.

Pesimo servicio! De principio te tratan muy bien para que compres,compre una troca y salio defectuosa, solo me estan dando largas para arreglarla, mas de 3 semanas con la troca estacionada y ellos solo dicen yo te hablo, no me hablan yo tengo que andar hablandoles.Normalmente compras un vehículo para utilizarlo ,en mi caso no, 3 semanas con la troca si la he manejado 2 veces es mucho, su mecanico lleva diciendo que la pieza no llega, cuando la pieza la venden en Autozone, ni siquiera se necesita ordenar porque la tienen en existencia. Ademas no es el unico problema que tiene la troca(esta tirando aceite y agua) es mas que obvio que no la revisaron y solucionaron los problemas que traia antes de ponerla a la venta,con que la carpeta y la troca se vean limpia es suficiente para ellos, en lo personal se me hace una falta de etica profecional que solo se preocupen por vender y no por el bienestar de sus clientes. Yo ya hice mi primer pago, porque como le digo a la finaciera no te voy a  dar el pago porque la troca no la puedo maneja, no se puede verdad. Precaucion!!antes de comprar, mejor lleven a sus mecanicos antes porque despues esto se convierte en un dolor de cabeza.< /Review><Rate>1</Rate></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I recently moved to Fremont and was so lucky to find this place on google maps. Everyone is so nice and caring! The staff greeted me with smiles and wasted no time in getting me to the dentist. Dr. Victoria Louie and her assistant were friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient. From X-rays, oral health check up, to cleaning, the entire process only took an hour. When I called to have my x-rays released to an oral surgeon they did so immediately. Highly recommend!!<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>I’ve been going to Dr. Louie for about 25 years now. Excellent service. I feel like a part of the family every time I go in.
His Hygenists are very good and thorough.
Dr. Louie is a great guy and does outstanding work.
I would recommend them to anybody in need of dental work.< /Text><username>Jonathan Palmer<//username></record></dataset><record>

I have been coming to see Dr. Louie and his staff for almost 15 years. We are all like family at this point. (sometimes better than). Dr. Louie is a very talented dentist in every aspect of the field. And, Everyone, from the front desk, to the dental hygienists on staff, have exceptional, super honest caring, personalities. I would not go anywhere else at this point.< /text>

Have been a patient here for many years. Always have a great experience, the entire staff is ALWAYS pleasant, and I'm always informed of what needs to be done, if it can wait, and cost. I live in San Ramon and gladly make the drive to Fremont. My husband became a patient a couple years ago, and wishes he switched sooner! Love dr Louie and all the staff!</Review>

Doctor Louie is always patient and understanding of my special needs. He understand normal numbing shot don't usually work. He has to do his magic to get my mouth numb. Dr Louie makes double double sure I am comfortable. No pain before he start to drill.. The shots are like an ant bite. He made sure my pain was minimum. I am not a resident in the area. But the drive to Dr Louie is worth it. I know I am in good hands with DR Louie... The staff is amazing always.

Thank you Dr Louie and Staff

I have no complaints about my visit. Excellent service.  I was very pleased.                                       The office was running a few minutes late, maybe 15 minutes the most.  Which I didn’t mind at all.   In the future, since I work so close to the office.  I don’t mind being called 10!minutes before the appointment time asking me to arrive 15, 20, 30 or how ever long it is.  I don’t mind.  Again, the wait was very minimal.  and not an issue.</Text>

When I was younger I had a very bad dentist that really messed up my teeth  I gave up on dentist because I could not find a good one . I was referred to Dr. Chris I believe it was in 2004 my teeth were pretty much messed up when I came to Dr. Chris.   cares so much for his patients very gentle and he is a perfectionist I will never change dentist Dr. Chris I give you a 10+ YOU ARE THE BEST DENTIST not just in Fremont but ALL S.F Bay Area Thank you<//Text>

<text>Dr. Chris and his staff are very skilled, pleasant, professional and timely. He doesn't try to sell unneeded or unnecessary services and products. On all of the procedures he has performed on me, he has shown great skill, been expedient and gentle with no complications or issues. The same can be said for the hygenists Janine and Gayle.  I would whole heartedly recommend Dr. Christopher Louie, DDS and his staff for any and all of your dental needs.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x808fc72d5377b3bf:0x74b57c4ef971ef49</gmap_id></record>

A+ helped us remodel a garage workshop into a one bedroom apartment complete with bathroom and kitchenette. It was a big project and went as smoothly as I could have imagined. We really appreciated the expertise and willingness to work with us to reduce costs on the pieces that were less important to us. Most importantly they were always responsive and consistently responded within 1 business day to our many questions and scheduling needs. Great experience, would use again for future projects.<//review>

<Review>Our journey with A+ started after reading one of these reviews, I believe on google.   And here we are providing one.  From Mike who helped plan the project, to design team in the office to George our project manager, everyone exceeded expectations.  No project faces and ours was no exception but we we were kept informed, provided options that were meaningful and all ended well.  i will highly recommend A+ for your remodel project.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhJ69qx8nORixekl0qpsyp9a_cHc46W2eEZ2Nv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNP0TxDeKr1kw_JF2qnJ6meVSf_z47wOlrExvLt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXozmumPmRHawsXS-YvBB0sGlVcHPuWb5Yuk6y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Resp>

A+ just finished our kitchen and my husband and I are so glad that it’s done and we can enjoy it now! A nice gentleman came out and measured our kitchen and gave us a detailed quote and explained what we would be paying for essentially, which we really liked. We also liked that we weren’t pressured into signing, which made us feel more at ease. We ended up signing with them and our remodel began shortly after. We really like the group chat with everyone involved in our project. We asked questions there and were kept up to date. The end result was great and exactly how the designs showed it during the process. Would definitely hire these guys again.<//text>

< Review>
I hired A+ Construction & Remodeling to remodel my kitchen in Spring 2021. We walked through what I had in mind, developed a design, made revisions, and chose materials all within a reasonable timeline. This process was expedited by their responsive communication with me via a convenient texting app, which I appreciated. Despite the difficulties presented by the pandemic in terms of scheduling work and managing appliance deliveries, their employees and subcontractors did their best. Any errors and miscommunications were addressed. They were efficient throughout and I didn't feel rushed. And most importantly, my finished kitchen looks brighter and the design is consistent, which were my main objectives.< /Review>

When my husband and I decided we wanted to remodel our kitchen we knew that we needed to find a good company to help us make our (ok more my) kitchen dreams come true.

From the first contact with A+, it was very easy and quick to get someone to come out. Mike was our estimator, and he came down to Vacaville on a Friday night to take measurements and get our ideas. Then we went up to their showroom to pick out options. We even had to push the remodel for a couple of months and A+ didn't harass or push us and when we were ready they got us on their schedule right away.

George was our foreman and he also came down to the house to check things out. I wanted a wall removed and George was the one who could say if it was load bearing or not-spoiler it wasn't!! He was always quick to answer texts and email - and gave input whenever we needed it. The designer that helped us finalize everything was awesome and even helped us adjust our island so we would have more seating around it.

The crews were always punctual and cleaned up after themselves. If there was ever a change on the schedule my husband and I were both contacted so we could make necessary adjustments. We had already replaced our floors, so the crew was very careful of them, and took the floors up and then reinstalled them, around our new kitchen. Once all the work was completed George came back to do a walk through with us and even showed my husband how we could adjust the drawers if we wanted too. The crew even leveled out our refrigerator doors for us!

I think the attached pictures truly show the quality work that A+ does!<//Text>

These guys do a high-quality job. The prices are reasonable. I also appreciated the communication. Every worker that came to my house was skilled and knew exactly what to do. The project manager kept everything under control and reported to us every step of the way. We did not regret going with A+ construction & remodeling for our full house remodel. We are more than pleased with the result!</text>

Ellie is the best and Vadim was pretty great too. I was really struggling with my architect on a pretty big addition, and A+ took the time to listen to what we really wanted. They showed us several iterations using CAD technology, which is SO helpful. Ellie has a great design aesthetic and was professional and easy to work work. We haven't moved forward because the construction market is a little too frothy right now, but I would trust A+ to complete my project 100%.< /Text>

They arrived early and were incredibly nice and professional and did very tidy work and made it look like nothing ever happened. The quality of work is outstanding, and our project manager went above and beyond his role numerous times to ensure that our restoration went smoothly.

We purchased a house in Sacramento two years ago and had it renovated by this team before the Covid-19. It was specifically for a total remodel of our master bathroom and kitchen. They are extremely professional and got the job done in a timely matter.
The accessories in the bathroom were replaced. The glass and tiles were feeling so nice, which makes me stay-long in the bathroom. We are very happy with the result. They are exceptional with their customer service and follow-ups. No hidden fees or costs for other services.
I will not hesitate to call on them the next time I have a home improvement project in mind.</review>

We have just completed our kitchen remodel. All that we can say is amazing! The staff and crew were great! The design was out of this world and the work was perfect. The job was done with my husband and I at work during the day, which was wonderful that we could trust these guys in our home. The installers were very professional and friendly. The staff dealt with our changes with grace and efficiency. We are looking forward to our bathroom remodel later this year and we wouldn't think about going any place else. Thanks!</text>

This was our first remodel and we couldn’t be more nervous and excited! We did not know where to start and decided it was time to seek professional help. We came to A+ and these guys were wonderful and knowledgeable. It was obvious they knew what they were doing. We now have a new beautiful kitchen and new flooring throughout the house. I am glad we went with these guys.< /Text>

A+ Construction & Remodeling did an excellent job in our small kitchen and bathroom. We had a shower leak that ruined part of the subfloor in the bathroom, and so the job entailed removing the old linoleum, re-caulking the shower, and replacing the linoleum with tile. The refurbished kitchen was really pleasant, and I was so pleased about it. The entire process is smooth and tension-free. I really love the outcome, and it was more nice and amazing now. Everything was done to a very high standard in a timely manner by skilled workmen. The project manager was a joy to work with, always available, and extremely responsive. We'll definitely use them for any future projects. Highly recommended!</review>

<text>We just purchased our first home and want some upgrades on the kitchen and redo the main bathroom. They performed all work within the time frame and on the budget agreed on.
We replaced kitchen cabinets and countertops as well as appliances. In the bathrooms, we replaced the showers and all the water lines and installed a new tub with a tile surround, and replaced all accessories.
All in all, it was a pleasure having them remodeling the house. It was a hassle-free experience. If I ever have another project, I'd definitely go with A+ Construction & Remodeling.< /text>< userid>

The contractor has communicated with us every step of the way. They made sure we knew the timeline for everything from design to pricing. We are very pleased with their work and asked them to complete a couple of other projects around the house. I would totally recommend A+ Construction & Remodeling to anyone else!</Text>< Gmap_id>

Fantastic Construction Company to work with. My husband and I bought a property that needed a lot of work, particularly the kitchen. A+ Construction went out there and was able to get us a very detailed proposal for exactly what the kitchen needed.
They will definitely go an extra mile for a customer. I absolutely love how my kitchen turned out and was very happy with the process from design through the install. Overall, we had a good experience with this company. I do consider using them again for our future house projects.<//Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>We purchased a new apartment in our building after falling in love with the view but quickly realized we needed to renovate an older model kitchen which was walled off from our living room, and re-do our master bathroom.  We had a general concept of what we wanted so we began speaking to several contractors.  Immediately, from our first meeting, we knew A+ Construction & Remodeling was the design and renovation firm for us.  When you are doing something as intimate and as important as designing and renovating your home, relationship and communication is of the upmost importance.   A+ treats you like family.  They completely understood what our vision for our home was and began working on a plan for us. Their design team were vital to us in helping choose color schemes and materials that perfectly fit into the vision we had for our new home. Their project manager made sure the project stayed on track and took care of every single little detail concerning construction.  The fact that they have a showroom made the process even easier for us, and was very helpful in influencing some of our design ideas.  After discussing plans and choosing materials we were presented with an in-depth walk through of what our future home would look like.  We were blown away by the professionalism and detail that went into our presentation. We could not have been happier with the result. Everything from painting, to lighting, tiling, cabinetry; was done perfectly.  We were so impressed with the work they did, and the relationship we forged with them that we have hired them to do renovations at another home of ours.  Stay tuned for those pictures!< /Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>We chose A+ Construction for remodeling our kitchen. The process was smooth, and they've helped you along the way, providing you with the next steps to complete the project. Indeed very straight forward with the whole operation, and there have never been any hidden costs or unnecessary delays. The team showed up on time and left on time, very organized, hard-working guys. The result has surpassed our expectations. I'm so satisfied with their work.</review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x809adfc29c3f0bc5:0x88038d63c614cae7<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Based on all of the reviews, I was eager to work with A+ on our modest kitchen project in a small kitchen area.  All projects come with a budget.  When I initially called, I was asked what my budget was.  When I provided that figure ($10,000) for what I considered quite reasonable for materials and labor, it was suggested, in not so many words, that an in home consultation would be a waste of time as my budget did not rise to the typical amount for similar projects.  Although how does one define "similar" without event getting a layout of the project.  Anyway, moving forward.  Two stars for at least answering the phone.<//text>

At the beginning of this year, we decided it was finally time to spruce up our house. We ended up getting a few quotes from different contractors but A+ stood out to us with their customer service and attention detail. We changed our mind on a few design aspects down the road and these guys were great at accommodating that.
There was a hiccup with the city and their delays with issuing our permit but these guys worked with them and got it moving along. We are glad we ended up choosing them to do our remodel.< /Review>

Happy with the final project. 400sq ft addition, a master bath and bedroom. Not happy that it took one year to complete. After all the mistakes and delays, I wrote to the owner voicing my displeasure with the project. Never heard from him. $133,000 job. You’d think that at the end someone would call to say thanks for your business. We never saw our project manger the last 2 months of the project. No one from the company ever came to see the finished room... only hired subs were here. Very sad. I wonder where all these 5 star reviews came from...<//text>

We met with A+ Construction to give us estimates on a complete remodeling of our home.  Curt(sales representative) was honest, professional and provided us options that would be best on our budget.   We hired them to do a full home remodel.   George Roselle(project manager)for this company was highly professional and had a lot of patience with the numerous questions that we posed to him. The scope of the project was very detailed and complete.  Communication throughout the process was good via email or WhatsApp.   They provided sound work and used good materials.   You get what you pay for: QUALITY! . The quality of work was exceptional and my wife and I are very pleased with the finished product. We get compliments all the time about the design and quality of the work... it shows!  Their sub-contractors are very experienced and they cleaned up the job site each day.< /text>

I found this company from our neighbors and so glad I did. My hubby has renovated several houses before, so we can speak from experience that the folks at A+ construction are amazing. Their design team is talented, they helped us create a spectacular kitchen. What was also impressive is that they were so organized and paid a great deal of attention to detail. When there were some issues with a cabinet that arrived with a small defect, A+ quickly got them replaced. I am a happy customer and have nothing but good things to say about this company!</text>

After moving to a new house, it became apparent that we needed to remodel our kitchen. We took our time looking for a company that could make our plans a reality. After a long search and numerous quotes, we chose A+. Quality was a priority for us. Since we have a non-standard layout, the project was not an easy job. It was necessary to create a convenient and practical kitchen in a limited space. A+ team came to the rescue and made it possible taking all our wishes into account. They were always in touch and were always willing to help. The job was completed on time and we cannot be happier with our new kitchen.< /Text>

Hired them for a kitchen remodel on a budget. They were able to deliver a nicely finished modern kitchen design that exactly matched the digital model provided and worked to keep the project within budget despite a small remodel surprise. The kitchen is beautiful, cabinet quality is good, workmanship is great. Easy to work with. I would recommend them to others.< /Text>

Some of the cabinets I chose had to be back ordered due to covid-19 so that was a bummer but they found a perfect replacement for them which didn’t cause any delays. Otherwise the job was done on time and I am very excited about my new layout. Thank you guys! You got yourselves a loyal customer< /text>

I have been dreaming of a Pinterest-worthy kitchen layout for the longest time but when it came to finding the contractor I made my decision pretty quickly. I found A+ construction on yelp and after reading the reviews I decided to schedule a home appointment. I really liked the designer’s input and agreed to meet him at their showroom. They showed me some of the options and helped me stay within my budget, that was very important to me since I had my wedding coming up. Then the remodel started. One of the things I really liked is the lock box system. I didn’t have to be around 100% of the time and I really appreciated that. We were in touch throughout the whole process since they created a WhatsApp chat with the people involved. I was aware of all the progress.<//Text>

We used A+ Construction & Remodeling to renovate our kitchen after our good experience with them on a bathroom renovation. A+ Construction & Remodeling is filled with beautiful sample rooms as well as a large supply of cabinets, counters, and glass samples to use when deciding on finishes. The experience is full service with a designer guiding the process and offering choices tailored to your needs. There is also a project manager that is onsite daily to oversee all aspect of the renovation. A+ made the renovation process seamless and in the end we got the kitchen of our dreams.< /review>

I was not wrong trusting this company to make a small remodeling. I wanted to surprise my parents from their anniversary vacation since they have been gone for 3 weeks. I had their kitchen and the bath in their master's bedroom remodeled for a good cost. The designer was brilliant at pointing out what to replace and how to make it spacious and more appealing to everyone’s eyes. And I was not disappointed, my mom and dad was very happy with it. Highly recommended.<//review>

The house we bought had a tiny kitchen but I love the rest of the house. We called A+ Construction & Remodeling to remodel my kitchen into something I could actually cook in. They were fast and professional, and I love my new kitchen. Thank you A+ Construction & Remodeling, I'll call when we're ready to remodel my bathroom.</Text>

<Review>I appreciate how much effort they put on our kitchen for it to be finished on time. They were very informative and responsive to our requests, calls, and even emails. They were on top of everything and I can't recommend them enough how professional they were with their work. Kudos to the whole team.<//Review>< Pics>

They were very professional and honest with their work. They were able to do a great job with our kitchen. They were able to put a granite top on our kitchen and it looks wonderful that adds beauty to our house. It was a great job they did and I do highly recommend them to everyone.<//text>

They were by far the best remodeling company that I met. The service was outstanding, their ideas were brilliant and they won’t cost too much for their work. They’ll give their A+ quality service if you need them. Simply worth recommending.</Review>

<Review>We recently completed a renovation of our Bathroom Vanities and Master Bath Shower and Floor.  The result was a beautiful transformation and we are immensely pleased with the job that A+ Construction & Remodeling did. From start to finish.  Igor and the various members of his crew and staff are real professionals and true craftsmen. Very pleasantly pleased with the process and amazed at the quality of work that was done on our project.  Definately will use and recommend again.< /Review>< pictures>

The kitchen updates I had done with A+ Construction & Remodeling came out amazing. We had a wine fridge installed into an already updated kitchen. They used so much the care and expertise to install it, it looks like it was there since the kitchen was originally redone. So impressed. Will definitely use this company again for any other kitchen and bathroom upgrade needs!<//Text>

Outstanding! I had to move to North Highlands last summer 2019 due to work reasons and I was required to look for a house that I can live permanently since the company I am working will pay the half of the property's cost. I was able to find a house at a low price but had to make renovations on the kitchen and bath. Thankfully, I found this remodeler to work for me at an affordable price. The workers then, started the job immediately when I got the schedule and plan done and finished everything within the time frame. They rechecked everything before leaving. I didn’t have to stress myself thinking if they will do the job right. Thank you.</Text>

I was glad that after purchasing a home, the agent recommended A+ to call if we needed some renovation before we move in. Well, it was worth the call, and they were very responsive and showed professionalism upon visiting the house that I wanted them to make a small adjustments.

But A+ Construction was surely worth my trust. They renovated my kitchen and bath even though without my full supervision because I was staying in Arizona and had to make a trip to visit my house, yet they showed honesty and high work ethics because during the final checking, everything was done fine and I am absolutely stunned with the improvement. It’s worth the money as well. Thumbs up for that.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x809adfc29c3f0bc5:0x88038d63c614cae7</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

DO NOT HIRE THEM!!!!
This could not have been the worse company my family has hired for major remodeling. None of their initial promises were carried out!!! After 100K and months of lagging they are still telling us very evasive as to when this nightmare will be over.
It began with lots of promises and smiles, and half a year later we found out that they have  fired all their employees and are now working with subcontractors. Had we known this would be happening, we would have never hired them.
Trash still standing out, the house is uninhabitable, and the timeline that they gave us is way past due.
Our next resort is Department of Consumer affairs ans civil litigation that even if it takes long time we will make sure that they do not do this to any other people!!!
DO NOT HIRE THEM!!!!<//Review>

<text>Job well done! This was our first time experiencing a home remodel and working with a general contractor. The workers were courteous and skilled. We stayed in the house during the remodel and the team completely cleaned up each night.  They were professional and knowledgeable through the whole process.<//text>< userid>

<Text>We recently determined that our kitchen was outdated and needed an update. We talked with several kitchen remodelers and determined that A+ Construction & Remodeling fit our budget and timeline. We were very happy with our choice. Their design staff worked with us to select all the colors and parts for our new kitchen. The work crew were courteous, professional and did a superb job. We had our cabinets refaced, with new fronts, drawers, pulls and silent closures. We also had them install new counter tops. We purchased the back splash and appliances which they installed. I would definitely recommend them without hesitation. All of our friends comments on how beautiful our kitchen looks.< /Text><Response>None</Response></record></dataset><record>

<review>Thank you A+ Cons for helping us with our new kitchen and bathroom project! The crew of plumbers, tilers, and installers were really great.  They are very skilled, and did beautiful work.  They were also very accommodating in many ways throughout the job, polite, timely, and neat.  Very professional team that delivers on time.</review>< Pics>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>They had exactly what I needed. If you need some random part, they'll find out exactly which part you need, and most likely have it. After I left, I realized that I never would have found the part I needed. The kitchen updates I had done with A+ Construction Pro came out amazing. We had a wine fridge installed into an already updated kitchen. They used so much the care and expertise to install it, it looks like it was there since the kitchen was originally redone. So impressed. Will definitely use this company again for any other kitchen and bathroom upgrade needs!</Text>< pictures>

<text>Company A+ Construction Pro had a great service and I was pleasured to work with them, I used them many times and always had a great experience. They offered a full service kitchen renovation that went beyond regular kitchen design and renovation. They helped create a wonderful kitchen after considering what we want and then adding their own unique design and features. The entire construction and design team worked well together to make sure our dream kitchen becomes a reality.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

A+ construction did a fantastic job on my Kitchen. The work was professional and the remodel was beautiful. We get rave reviews from everyone who sees the new kitchen and floors, and it looks like a new model home. All the workers are craftsmen and artists in their own right, and helped me with design decisions that had to made along the way. I would definitely use them again and reccomend them to friends.</Review>

As you as it gets is right! Best price, exceptional professionalism all the way around. Ours was a tiny bathroom remodel, but A+ Construction & Remodelingwas outstanding in making it the best bathroom possible. The material is superb. The floor and light installation was excellent. The fixtures are the best. We love it.<//Text>

I like this remodeling company, aside from they were affordable their service is simply outstanding and the workers were professional. They finished remodeling my bath in just a few days and finished my kitchen dew days after. It was not stressful for me, I didn’t have to deal with unwilling and awkward workers. Thanks!< /text>

I had a kitchen and 2 bathrooms fully remodeled by A + Construction.  Working with the team was very easy and a pleasant experience overall.  They made sure to walk me through the whole process which made me feel reassured since this was my first time remodeling my home and I was a bit nervous.  They were very organized and made sure to clean everything up after they were done.  They did such a great job that I convinced my friend to get her kitchen remodeled as well.  My new space look great and I would definitely recommend this company!<//text>

They did great work on remodeling our kitchen. They were professional, reliable, and great to work with. They handled the work professionally and pulled out all the stops to ensure the work was finished on time, and to the high level of quality we desired for. They are all highly skilled, hard working, with plenty of experience – and easily handled something unexpected that came their way.<//review>

We hired A +Construction Pro to remodel our kitchen and bathroom in our house.  The project manager, George, was a big help and helped us out through the process.  The crew transformed our home and we were blown away by the end result.  The bathroom and kitchen turned out so beautiful!  They finished the project in a timely manner and the pricing was fair for the beautiful work they did.  We see ourselves using their services again in the future.< /review>

A+ Construction…more like D+ Construction! If you are looking for a company with horrendous communication, shotty workmanship, total disregard for timeline, and argumentative contractors, then look no further! Our experience with A+ was, to say the least, an absolute nightmare! The scope of our project was simple: reface cabinets and replace sinks and countertops in the bathrooms and kitchen. We were told that the project timeline would take approximately 2-3 weeks, because it was not a large job. Having an understanding of the nature of renovations, we assumed that at worst it would take 6 weeks. We were a skeptical of the timeline because we were going on vacation on what would be week 5, but were reassured that that would in fact make things easier. Demolition for our project began on Thursday, January 23rd. Naively we assumed that once demolition had begun, the rest of the construction crew would be lined up. No one showed up to our house for the next 4 weeks, leaving us with the only running water coming from our shower (thank goodness we didn’t have them work on those as well!) Following the 4 week hiatus, we finally received communication that work on the cabinets was set to begin, and things would begin progressing. When asking about the delay, we were told that it was due to the cabinets not arriving (the real delay was due to the fact that the cabinet doors had not yet been ordered, despite us having paid upfront for the materials!) One would think that before you demolish what someone already has, that you would already have ordered what is going to replace it, however, that would have required common sense! With the lack of progress that had occurred up until that point, to say we were nervous to go on vacation was an understatement. We were gone for 2 weeks, and were expecting everything to be done, with the exception of some minor details, as the cameras on our house had indicated the crew being at our house well past midnight every day. When we arrived home, we were in for a rude awakening! Next to nothing had been done, which begged the question of what they were doing at our house for such long stretches of time! When we questioned the “project manager” about the lack of progress, we were told it was due to providing them with such a constrained schedule! (Not really sure how that is possible when you just had 24/7 access to our house for the last 2 weeks?!) It was problem after problem with this company! When our backsplash was installed, it was installed incorrectly, and we were not offered so much as an apology for the error. After the frustration of not having sinks for 4 weeks, it was another 4 weeks (total of 8 weeks) before we finally had someone come and re-install the appliances in our kitchen (we had to reinstall our washer and dryer ourselves). When our cabinets were finally worked on, not all the doors and drawers had been ordered. They came back painted in two different colors, handles were installed crooked, they were not soft close as promised, and some of the drawer faces were the wrong size! To make matters worse, they left everything they installed FILTHY! There were scuff marks, saw dust, dead bugs, you name it, left inside of those cabinets and drawers by the time they were done, and we were left to clean it ourselves. The lack of communication from everyone involved in the project, especially when something went wrong, was abysmal. The contractors that showed up to our house were constantly asking US what needed to be done (pretty sure that is direction you should be getting from the people who sent you?) We can count several instances which conveniently had “not been accounted for” in the original product plan. As of today, May 20th, we JUST had our final inspection. Things are still not done completely right, and A+ has no intention of fixing them. If we could give them 0 stars we would. DO NOT EVEN CONSIDER WORKING WITH A+!<//text>

<Review>A+ Construction Pro gutted my four bedrooms from top to bottom and did a good job! I knew that designers have ideas and think out-of-the-box, but their Rachel leads the whole pack! Bravo! I wish I were so inventive! OK, the company is a pleasure to work with. They listen to your suggestions and consider every detail with a perfect vision of your home. They’re polite and patient. They don’t push their ideas on you. It’s the client that makes the decision. The great thing about A+ Construction Pro is that they have direct access to the construction and finish materials needed so that there were no bumps. I love that all renovation work went smoothly and as scheduled. I had a greatly positive experience!< /Review><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

I usually don't write many reviews but I had to make an exception for world class. Just finished having my kitchen remodeled by world class.  They truly are world class. From design to finished product was  simply awesome.  It was the experience everyone hopes for when having a construction crew in your home.  Terry's crew was way ahead of schedule on completion and we were thrilled. My wife and I shopped around for almost 2 months before deciding on world class kitchen. The Prices  and craftsmanship can't be beaten. I am a person who has numerous questions every step of the way. The owner Terry was always there whenever I had a question. He had offered up suggestions that I would have never even thought of.  If you are ever in the need of remodel I would without a doubt hands down choose A+ Construction Pro for my remodeling needs. Thank you, Terry and your extraordinary staff for making our home a pleasure to entertain guests<//Text>

<Review>This has been the best remodeling experience that my wife and I have ever had. The team from A+ Construction  is at the top of their game starting with our first visit from their project estimator to the great professionals that labored to do the finest work possible. Ours was a complete remodel not just replacing cabinets etc. The job foreman and his lead associate were very considerate to Kim and I as to what we thought regarding their days work and if we were pleased. This is a first class construction company who believes in doing things right, much like the tradesmen of decades past. A+ will be doing future projects for Kim and I. You can trust this fine firm with your remodeling wishes. Thank you all from A+ for our beautiful kitchen.

I have just finished my house remodel. It involved my kitchen, two bathrooms, and a powder room. I was referred to the A+ Construction Pro by my friend who had used them and had very positive feedback.
Brendon was always responsible, professional and  dedicated to his work. He was also very patient and polite. Most importantly, he is very intelligent and knowledgeable about his trade.
I would highly recommend A+ Construction Pro<//text>

Remodeling our kitchen, we A+ Construction was truly a great experience! It was prompt, stress-free and the result was excellent. I would definitely recommend them for the job well done and I would surely hire them again. They used a high quality material, great design and the price was quite reasonable. I love it!< /Text>

<Review>We had a great experience working with A+ Construction Pro. We had a new bathroom installed in late 2013. Our old bathroom was completely gutted to the concrete slab and studs. A+ Construction Pro staff helped with the design and guided us through the process. They helped us pick out fixtures and worked out the project timeline. The contractor did a great job on the bathroom. Reasonable price and very easy to work with. Very high-quality bathroom. We are very happy with our decision to hire A+ Construction Pro.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1478780292987, 'text': 'Reading this review we feel incredibly proud of what we do!

Terry and his team were great from start to finish.  We were able to agree on a final price upfront which was comforting knowing there would be no surprise increases.  They completed our job in under 4 weeks which was great since it was a little bit of a disruption with our 9 month old.  Every member of the team that was on site was courteous and clean.  Thank you guys for the great job.  I will keep the referrals coming.< /review>

< Review>
We recently completed a complete kitchen, back powder room and laundry room renovation with A+ Construction Pro. They had renovated our Master bathroom a few years ago, and we are still enjoying that gorgeous space. The current results are absolutely stunning and this kitchen project was handled efficiently and professionally, the owner, as well as all of the people who work for him. Everyone involved with the project, from Brendon to his contractors and even the designer he recommended, added smart and exceptional details to this very large and very complicated renovation. We completely flipped the entire kitchen and it now flows perfectly and is a phenomenal area for both cooking and entertaining. As the project developed, improvements and changes to the plan were always met with a "can do"< /Review>

While Looking at their work, we know that the kitchen they have made for us is very special. I am no expert but from the result of the kitchen remodeling, its way better than any other kitchen that I have seen before.

Hiring a kitchen remodel company was a bold move for us but it was definitely a move we wouldn’t regret. Thanks A+ Construction Pro Inc.</text>< pics>

I trusted A+ Construction Pro throughout the entire process and didn't waste time worrying about being screwed. This was not an inexpensive project, but you do really get what you pay for.

Terry and his team renovated a master bath which was anything but master. The space is rather small and we wanted it redone from top to bottom. Terry came in and gave my husband and I some good ideas on how to make space look bigger. Once he and his team started, the process was completely smooth and easy. They were here at the same time every morning and took great care to cover the floors and carpets leading to the bathroom. At the end the day they cleaned up everything completely. The job was done within the time frame Terry stated and the bathroom is everything I could have imagined and more! Our next project is a kitchen renovation and when the time comes, I will use A+ Construction Pro for that as well. I would highly recommend them to anyone< /Text>

<review>We have been very pleased with the results of our kitchen remodel.  There were a few issues, like delays in the construction process due to orders not coming in on schedule.  While it was a little rough living out of our spare bedroom for the extended time, the company more than made up for our inconvenience.

Our project coordinator, Milan, was a pleasure to work with and really helped us on the design concept and the multiple decisions we needed, but weren't really prepared to make, like coordinating the various materials, colors and patterns, as well as choosing hardware, lighting, etc.  He really hit the nail on the head and gave us a great new kitchen.

I also want to commend all the construction crew, including Andre, Dmitriy, Art, Sergei, Paul, and Vasili.  I apologize if I missed anyone who helped out!  They were all a true blessing to have in our home.  They were true artists and craftsmen and were very concerned to make sure the job was done right.  Our house was kept clean (as clean as possible) during the process, and they were all very available to help answer any questions.  They truly went the extra mile to make sure our project was done correctly.

We plan to use the company again for a few projects in the future and can't recommend them highly enough.  Thank you!!!!<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>My husband and I wanted our kitchen updated and called A+Construction Pros. We yelped and Googled all the reviews and were very impressed. From the beginning of our project Michael helped us in choosing the products and design, George was there for us also answering all our questions and concerns. But the biggest asset to this company is Vadim. He's very skilled in all areas of construction and was able to set our minds at ease when something was delayed. Thank you again to everyone who was involved in this remodeling, we're very glad we went decided to use your company and would recommend you to anyone.<//Text>< userid>

<review>A+ Construction Pro's team is a joy! We had a wall taken down to open up the kitchen to the dining room. The entire crew lined up everything for us and detailed exactly what to expect. Courteous, professional, and above all else they demonstrated that they wanted us to be happy with the final outcome. We love the new space! Thank you!< /review>< gmap_id>

<rating>5</rating><Review>We recently had our master bathroom remodeled by A+ Construction Pro, which involved new flooring, removal of a garden tub and expanding our shower into a walk-in shower.  We also added quartz countertops and new sinks.  From start to finish, they were very professional and assisted in selection of materials and communicated with us every step of the way.  They completed the project on time and within budget.  Their staff were very helpful and the staff that performed the work were very experienced craftsman.  We would certainly go with A+Construction Pro’s for our future home projects.< /Review>< response>

The whole team were remarkable in helping  us to hone our vision for our kitchen reno, and were amazing partners throughout the process. Their design recommendations proved to be spot on, they were always respectful of our budget, were creative in finding options we liked and felt comfortable with, and were always generous with their time. They made a stressful process fun and inspiring.
Overall, we are thrilled with the results--we just love our beautiful new kitchen-- and highly recommend A+ Construction Pro. Kitchen Remodeling.</text>

This is a one-stop opportunity.  All the materials plus the installation are included in their business plan.  There is no need for a separate contractor.<//review>< response>

We planned to replace our windows and did our research. We found the best way to replace our windows through this company. We have a quote on window replacement from this company and another 2 window company. They had the better price, so we decided to call them and see how it turns out.
The new windows came in about 2 weeks as promised and they were nicely packed and arrange for secured transportation. When the windows came in, the installation was scheduled right away. The installer came on time and was great with the installation. When the job was done, they took away our old windows and cleaned up. They completely constructed and installed 6 windows within 2 days. After the installation, the difference was like night and day!
Thanks!<//text>

When we moved into our new house, we needed completely new cabinets for our kitchen. Brendon helped us choose all of the materials, came to measure our space, and then completely designed the kitchen for us. We have been cooking in our kitchen for 2 years now, and could not be happier with the placement of everything and the overall design we went with. When we had some problems with our cabinets recently, he came out and replaced the fronts for free. We would definitely go back if we ever moved to a new place.<//Text>

We had a wonderful experience re-doing a bathroom with A+ Construction Pro.  Brendon was great at helping us paint a vision from the pictures we had clipped online, and set us up with some awesome vendors for tile and fixtures.  Our contractor Terry was everything we could have hoped for - a great communicator, perfectionist, and totally professional.  He and his team did beautiful work and showed great respect for our home and our time while working with us.

We had a small issue with the countertop and the A+ Construction Pro team stood by their work and corrected the problem - and quickly.

Could not be happier with our choice to work with A+ Construction Pro on this project.< /Review>

Timely, Fast, Neat, Personable, Affordable.  Not many more accolades I can add for my experience with  A+ Construction Pro.  I called on Monday, they came on Wednesday, we talked.  Following Friday, they found a financial institution to finance the project.  Monday they were there to demo the kitchen.  Two weeks later to the day, the job was completed. Perfect scenario</text>

<text>We used A+ Construction Pro to renovate a hall bathroom and completely remodel our master bathroom in the summer/fall of 2014. Terry and his team worked through multiple design changes we made for the master bathroom project after construction had begun.  We were extremely pleased with the final product and workmanship. Terry and his team were professional, courteous, and maintained a clean work area.  Terry helped us with issues we encountered with some of our suppliers during the project, which required Terry to make extra efforts to resolve these issues.  This included chasing after the supplier almost a year after our project was complete to replace a flawed shower door.  Terry got the shower door replaced and installed at no cost to us.  We would definitely recommend A+ Construction Pro<//text>< pictures>

<Text>We highly recommend A+ construction. They are professional, honest and did an incredible job installing my counter, sink, faucet, disposal and backsplash. They gave me a two week time frame for project completion and finished within a week in a half. The foreman Vadim B. is excellent. He was in contact with me regularly, he is professional and has a good team of guys. George the general manager also gets high marks.

Thank you for a job well done!< /Text>< Pictures>

We worked with Brendon to convert a walk-in closet to a master bathroom.  Brendon was very timely, easy to talk to and really did an outstanding job setting us up with contacts to help us pick out all of our materials.  We didn't have to worry about any of the details because the people Brendon set us up with were outstanding, easy to work with and on top of all the details so we didn't have to be.  There was only one small hiccup and it was contractors showing up to work on a Saturday morning without us knowing ahead of time.  Only an issue because we have 2-year-old twins and they needed to shut the water down.  There were no other communication issues and in fact, our foreman, Terry, was fantastic at communicating throughout the project.  Timing was tricky because the job was done around the holidays, but there were no issues with work days or times.  Brendon and his team were not the least expensive, but the quality of their work was worth every penny<//text>

<Review>If you’re looking, stop! When I saw their prices online,  immediately I reserved my unit. Then I called as it said to do and Sean picked up the phone with such a friendly manner. His attitude was kind and welcoming. We made arrangements for me to go in the following day and the process was so quick and easy! I’m super happy with my unit and the price as well as the customer service!

Thank you so much Sean!!<//Review><Date>1610651964773</Date>< pictures>

<Review>Don't put your belongings in this facility,  the place is fility. Last year during the pandemic I had to store my daughters belongs from college. When we came back only 4 months later to gather her things,  the majority of her belongs were damage due to rat feces. The place is infested with rodens! Very dirty never again will I use their service again!!!! Think twice about this place!! Thank god for the Insurance that covered a small fraction of what her things were worth. The company's insurance took forever to cut a check.  Horrible customer service.<//Review><user_name>Gilbert A<//user_name><resp>{'time': 1618523178270, 'text': 'Gilbert A, we regret to hear that you had a negative experience with us, but would appreciate the chance to turn your experience around.'}< /resp></record></dataset><record>

My wife I had a great experience renting from here, very friendly and helpful people, we had to move out becasue we need early morning access for our BBQ sauce business, but we would have stayed otherwise. They are very safe, we never had any problems or saw anything strange going on around us, would give another star if they changed the hours back to the ways the were before</Text>

The place is nice and manager is extremely kind! Unfortunately, i did have a bad experience. I had my thing in a storage for 2-3 weeks. When i went this weekend to pick up my belongings and take them to new apartment i opened the storage door to see rat sh*t on my bed along with my brand new couches chewed all up ! i was so hurt because i just bought these couches now they are ruined. I called Anthony in the front office. He was very kind with assisting me on getting a claim started .<//review>

<text>I have mixed feelings about the storage. On one hand the staff are polite and courteous. On the other hand they won't work with you. I got sick and spend time in the hospital I Miss The courier payment. Want to have the funds for it they will not accept it and sold my stuff. So with the information in your hand you make your decision decision from that.<//text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80900cbf404f7e13:0xc2b87ca8d93846dd</GmapID></record>

The Manager Katie, was fantastic to work with, my boyfriend and I rented a storage today, and she went above and beyond my expectations. She showed us the unit which was clean, definitely not what I was expecting when I think of storage. Katie greeted us when we walked in with a great smile. The entire process was extremely easy. She went through the lease with us, which was very impressive. Katie made sure we understood every aspect of the lease. I would recommend Smart Stop to anyone that is looking for storage. Thanks Katie.</Text>

<Review>Very good place and good staff (original post)

Today: when I went to pick up my things the staff had put a lock on my unit even though I was up to date on my payments I open my unit and my things were ruined by mice when I told the staff the staff told me that I needed to make sure my policy had insurance on it which I was not offered insurance by Anthony when I first moved in these are things that I cannot get back these are things that insurance don't pay for either childhood memories and the childhood memories of my three children they have one bait station per row their facility is filthy when I was driving through yesterday they don't want to clean up because of the Heat I don't recommend this place not recommended<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I had a good time renting here until the last month when my unit got robbed, my crackhead neighbor jumped over my wall and stole valuables, but that's not the companies fault, and they were a big help when it came time to file my claim, I wil update my review when the claim is paid but I had the insurance so it should be taken care of, thanks Layssa and Anthony for all your help.

Going into Extra Space was the best idea I ever had. I got the best deal I could find in my area and my storage size needs. Cyndy and Amanda were the two most awesome people I've ever met. Very professional, and knowledgeable about everything I needed to know and answered every question I had with detail I could understand. Cyndi was so great entertaining my son while Amanda and I did the paperwork. That's pretty awesome in my book.
I have already recommended them to some friends that are in need of a storage. Thanks for all your help Cyndy and Amanda.
EDIT: THE STORAGE FACILITY CHANGED OVER TO SMARTSTOP SELF STORAGE AND THEY ARE EQUALLY AS GOOD AS EXTRA SPACE WAS.<//text>

<review>Very fast service, the first month free promotion isnt really free tho, you still have to pay $25 and insurance , and it doesnt cover everything i have stored, but the storage units are basic and clean, my neighbors not so much. Bring your own mouse bait or sticky traps because jerks do store food here even tho its not allowed. If i was storing anything that needed to stay clean i would store in bins not bags and wrap everything up 2x. Prices will increase over time, i just got my first increase but its only a few bucks, not like other places.
Good people working, helpful and i always see the bald guy with a broom or garbage can when i there, the place isnt spotless but its never dirty either.

overall, I would rent here again, or reccomend it to others, GREAT SECURITY SYSTEM</review>< Rating>

Best storage experience I’ve had so far. Katie made the process quick and easy. She showed us the unit before we signed any papers to make sure it was the right size which I’ve never had someone do before. Thank you for a great experience!</review>

<review>These guys helped me out of a financial bind I found myself in . My fault really, just forgot to pay the bill and fell too far behind, they gave me a chance to come back, keeping me on track with payments until i could pay my unit out of auction, calling me and reminding me when even i forgot to pay up, that meant a lot. only had one mice problem during my stay, but i would def put down traps and bait in case someone was storing food nex door. thanks for not auctioning my stuff</review><username>lamar r< /username><gmapID>0x80900cbf404f7e13:0xc2b87ca8d93846dd<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Current update, so I've been with this facility for over a year now. It's lately under new management his name is Sean. I've had to deal with nothing but attitude from him. This facility still has Anthony who is always polite. Sean needs to worry about the rats, ants and homeless people living in this facility that no one talks about!< /review>

<Text>Let me tell whom ever is thinking of going to this storage facility!!!! Look No longer. Since I've gone to this business I have had nothing BUT GREAT SERVICE THERE , VERY HELPFUL IN NOT JUST STORAGE PAYMENTS, but really welcoming and make one feel like they will work with you. Even Listen if you need to vent. All in All I have nothing but wonderful things to say about the storage place also it's very very clean and the hours are like no other storage. Garanteed you will be satisfied. In more ways than you could think of. Give them a call. Or better yet go see for yourself.< /Text>< Date>

Customer service is excellent and units are monitored daily by staff and video surveillance. Unit rentals are relatively low cost ($90 for a 10x10). I did have a problem with break-in's, however Melissa helped me alot, she remained friendly and professional while working with me on properly securing my items and unit.<//review>

Alyssa ability to multitask and do it efficiently was one of the reasons why I decided to put our belongings at smartstop self storage. Not only did Alyssa have a great customer service. her ability to explain everything in detail and answer all my questions without hesitation was exceptional. Smartstop self storage is a clean well maintained self storage facility.   I am positive that Smartstop is the only place Ill store my belongings.  Smartstop is a clean well maintained,secure self storage with great access hours and convenient drive up storage units and the price in my budget. They are 100% my favorite and only self storage business . Mahalo nui loa Alyssa for ur awesome help. You're great customer service is appreciated.</review>

<rating>1</rating><text>I have a 5' by 10' storage in the "A" row and I had to empty it out because everything inside was stained with mouse urine and covered in mouse feces. When I let the staff know they said "well this is an outdoor facility. the most I can do is put some pellets in there" So I called the insurance company that we are REQUIRED to pay an additional $11 (or more) a month to cover our belongings, and they told me that there is an "additional page" to the policy information (that we DO NOT receive) where it states that they don't cover damage due to rodents and insects. So basically I paid $72 a month to have all mine and my children's clothing and shoes destroyed by rodents and the facility doesn't bother putting out pellets unless there is a complaint. GREAT.<//text>< Pics>

Cyndi Sweeten was very pleasant and knowledgeable of units that was available. I was able to tell her what I was storing and was able to suggest the unit that was best. After moving everything in the unit was a perfect fit .

I have been using this storage facility for over 5 years. It has changed ownership 3 times since I acquired my unit there. The price of the unit continually increased every month, little by little, until I was paying twice as much for the unit.
Also, the security of this place has gone down hill. This is the ultimate reason for me leaving. There had been over 20 units broken into over a month long period as well as people loitering and living in the buildings. I complained to the office manager, but she explained that she couldn't do anything about them, since they were paying customers.
Don't use this place to store for anything valuable... It WILL get stolen.< /text>

Yes the place on Lorraine in Stockton is a great storage facility onsite manager and Sandy she's just a wonderful gal and I hope you keep her around for a long long time where she can become the owner of this place cuz she runs it she keeps it neat and clean and safe and secure as a matter of fact I think you should give her 10 Stars instead of 5 thank you< /text>

<text>Thanks to Sean I was able to move in quickly and easily. He was very helpful and very detailed in the policies that they have to enforce. Property was clean and well managed and so was the storage space. I’ve tried other storages and no one is as clean as this place . Thanks again Sean and the rest of the team! Stay cool, beat the heat!

This place has been going downhill for a while... it is father's day 2017 at 12:15pm, this is how the "buffet"  looks like  for the past half an hour., EMPTY!!! The meatloaf was raw, there was no cutlery,  and everybody was very upset ... they gave us our money back and we left.
this is the last time we come here...</Review>

So I came in yesterday with me and my kids. The food was delicious. The restaurant was nice and clean. The servers were really nice they kept up with the plates. And the manager at Felipe was awesome he kept checking on me and the kids to make sure everything was OK. We will be back again. My kids love the little ice cream cones and the desserts they have there.<//text>

<text>It's not so much that I disliked the place. I'm just partial to the Tracy location.

There was nothing wrong with the food's taste. Rather my issue is lack of choices. It was lunch hour so maybe I'm just used dinner hour and that menu.<//text>< Rating>

<text>Absolutely nostalgia and great buffet food here!! The fried fish, the popcorn shrimp, the ranch dressing, carrot cake and vanilla yogurt are a killer combination and will be the reason for my next nap. Also the servers are so friendly!

Let's just say there's a reason why hometown buffets are closing down. Run down, food is overall gross and doesnt look very sanitary. Spend the extra money and go golden corral if you desire a buffet.<//Review>

<text>This place is supportive of military, so immediate approval. The food is decent, for a all you can eat buffet is actually pretty good. It's cheap, and there doesn't seem to be many options that we've found in the area that are all you can eat. I would recommend this place if you're looking for a lot of food for cheap, but don't eat here to often from a health perspective. Unless you get the salads, salads are pretty good, and have a lot of options. Side note I eat keto and is do able here.<//text></record>

Felipe and his staff were fantastic as we hosted our Christmas in November event at Hometown.

The breakfast and lunch menus were delicious and the service was awesome.

Our guests felt welcomed and enjoyed themselves.

Loved it! Great experience overall!</text>

Buffet fans will love this place! Best hometown that's still around. If you eat at restaurants and don't know why you're going to a buffet and you have a bad attitude then obviously you probably wont enjoy any buffet. The place is clean, dishes are clean as they can get them assuming they have to use a washer to get so many dishes cleaned so often. Food is good, obviously not good as going to a restaurant charging $20+ a plate, but good for a buffet and great for a hometown buffet brand! I recommend this place to all fans, especially if you've been to Hayward location; this location is much better! Enjoy!<//Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>One of the last Hometown Buffet's left in Northern Cal... Run by the most excellent Felipe! Great All American favorites done in a classic style... The mashed potatoes and gravy are delicious, the fried chicken is on point every single time! Their breakfasts have all of the favorites without any extra stuff 2 confuse the issue! Great place for traditional food!<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>Good food, some a little cold. Great atmosphere. Alot of retired military go there. Waitresses there know them by first name. Great price just took my munchkin there for a celebration dinner after selling a home. Desserts are the best, peach cobbler is my favorite. Also you get #militarg discounts. On Mondays its called Military Monday there. Its great that they support our troops #holdenhomesrealty #justsellwithlynell #travel #lynellholden #justsellwithlynell #hometownbuffet #food #travelguides #fairfield #realestate #military<//Text>< pics>

Food was plain, no flavor, and cold. For as much as your paying per person I thought it would be better. And let's not even talk about how nasty the bathroom was! Don't recommend!!<//Text>

<text>If I could give zero stars I would. This place is horrible and disgusting. I’m not sure how they are still in business. There was spilled food all over the floors, the cups were sticky, the tables were sticky and gross, the bathroom looked like a tornado blew through there with paper towels all over the floors, and this was around 11:30 am! This wasn’t after a long day late at night. They had literally just opened. The food tastes horrible. The only thing I really enjoyed was my salad(s). It was very expensive for a salad! I won’t be back!< /text>< pics>

Was nice to find one still open. As a family, it is nice that everyone can choose what they want. The Fairfield location is about the middle of our 4 hour drive when heading to San Francisco or back home, so it is a great place to stop. We will stop again on another trip through .< /Review>

Not as clean overall appearance as it once was. The foods are getting boring. To offer the bulk favs. People go for is awsome however the offering is narrow on other selections. Aswell the foods are not as high quality in presentation.</Text>

They are okay if you like buffet food. I'm not a buffet person, but they do have a big crowd. Lots of people love this place. They have a nice gathering room. It's small but can be used for small birthday parties, meetings, baby showers ect.<//review>

It was ok nothing to rave about. Chicken was fried a little to hard for me, cornbread was hard on bottom. But the meatloaf is delicious and the mashed potatoes and gravy hit the spot. I'm sure it's something there you will like.</Review>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Text>Very quaint buffet with a militaryish theme and it was very relaxing. Our service was top notch. Our table rarely had dirty plate on it and if there was you'd blink and it was gone. Top notch service.

Reason for only four stars? While the food is good and nothing is like super wrong it was tiny bit bland and the Mac and cheese was watery.
Long shot from most buffets. I like this place<//Text><rate>4<//rate>< resp>

Good food and variety. The neighborhood was kinda sketchy (had a homeless person just come in grab food and ask if anyone wants sexual favors for money).< /Text>

I enjoy this place enough that I keep coming back. The food is nit Dancy but there is so many dishes to choose from in the buffet that it is not hard to find things you like. The salad bar is excellent. With salad, entrees, and dessert, the cost us no more than you will pay for just a sandwich elsewhere.< /text>

I came in here Sunday night and it was just awful. The water heater blew out (which can't be helped I know) which caused dishes to be scarce, but on top of that the food was very limited, and when they finally brought something out it was warm instead of hot. The options were just very slim. The floor was wet, some dishes were still dirty, the ice cream machine was also down. Just a horrible night and time. I wish they offered more variety, but it's the same every time I go. That with dinner costing $15 for what tastes like microwaved food? I'm good. Not worth it. I'm just going to go to Great Moon for my buffet options... Cheaper, more variety, less cramped environment.</text>

< review>
The food was disgusting the mac n cheese had no flavor and the majority if the food had no flavor. They more in likely have a new cook because the food was great just a few weeks ago.
A lot of the food wasn't refilled in there trays to serve and worst there were flies flying above the desert area that was a total turn off. We couldn't believe it and we didn't want to get seconds although we paid for it. We're not returning to Hometown Buffet.<//review>

< review>
So I use to live in Tennessee, where it is known as old country buffet. I grew up on this place and their food, nothing but great nostalgia. What happened to their quality of food? While the food is warm and cooked, everything was either overcooked or overly salty. Maybe my tastes changed as I got older, or the food itself changed. Now I'm going to give them another chance, but I must admit that my last experience really put me off of their food. Also, I remember there use to be a meat carving section at the old country locations. Maybe it's just regional, but I do miss them.<//review>

Everything tasted disgusting and the dishes and the tables were dirty. Everything was full of fat and I felt sick after 10 mins. The staff were a little rude and everything tasted horrible. Salads were ok but every other food was the worst thing I’ve ever tried, definitely not suggested😑👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼< /Review>

<Text>Super great!
I have many family visiting for Thanksgiving and did not have a place planned to go. So we decided to go to this place. After we walked in and payed they told us that the place was full and no tables available so we had to wait.
After explaining to couple of he employees about our situation they got a plan together to get a big table for my party.
Frankly, we wait for about 20 minutes but they were able to get a huge table for my party of 18 people. This was very impressive and we were very thankful for their service.
After that there were few of the employees attending our table assisting in removing dishes out and helping us bringing drinks for the little kids. This was a super service that even my family members whom come from El Pasó, Ohaio, Tennessee, Alabama, Oklahoma and New Mexico were amaized and glad for us of picking that place to go for our Thanksgiving dinner!
Great job to the team of this Hometown!!!</Text>< Rating>

<Name>Magda Tucker</Name><time>1555032164582<//time><review>The last 4  visits I have made to Home Town Buffet in Fairfield Calif,has been very unsatisfying.  Bathrooms is so discusting,no soap,tissues everywhere,trash is overflowing& bad odor,(female restrooms)... I have spoken to an employee who was cleaning tables next to where my family were seated& she stated to me,that they were going to put some hand soap,40 minutes later,discovered that the problem was not solved.....4 weeks later, I took my neighbor  there,to have dinner with me,she pointed out that the silverware were dirty& coffee cups had some lipstick, which it turned her appetite down. It was her first time quest to this Resteraunt & I was very unhappy due to her bad Birthday experience. ..last weekend,I give it another visit, long long wait,no clean tabels& silverware were not sterilized  well. I decided to send in a commend about my bad experience, cause my commute from my home to the nearest Hometown Buffet is 47 miles away. I do hope you will take my unhappy experience into consideration &  resolve this problem as soon as you can....Thank you again

This is by far the best one we've been to. Clean and fresh food was on point. The restroom could use a lil more TLC, but overall i rate them high. I felt bad i didn't have cash to tip our waitress-Viviana. She gave great customer service and a friendly greet. Im just not use to carrying cash, but hopefully me acknowledging her this way will make her the star employee!<//text>

The food server at the kitchen are not friendly at all, bathrooms are dirty , they do not have variety of foods and replenish them with latency.  they run out of steak so fast and the food servers are reluctant to refill. I will no longer go back to this place.</Review>

We drove from Sacramento to Fairfield just for Hometown. They closed all the Sacramento ones which super sucks. The food was better than i remembered and it was an overall good eat. Other than I ended up with an upset stomach from overindulgence, I have no complaints. We'll be back very soon!</review>

We went there last night because my father in law and my husband really wanted corned beef. We even sat through an hour of traffic to get there but when we got there they were all out and to top it all off, they're ice cream machine was out of order and they were out of water cups. It was just a little disappointing, but we'll be going back because my kids love it. It really is a great family friendly place.<//text>

I went there for the baby back ribs, roast beef, and cracked black pepper chicken Sunday dinner.  The ribs were too saucy, the beef was a tad dry, the chicken was surprisingly good.  However, for 10ish bucks it's a great deal.< /text>

Food is always warm, good seating, they always refill empty trays, and price is fair for a buffet. In an area where good buffets are non existant, this place isn't too bad. Downside? The taste of the food could be better. Its a step above frozen dinners, but its not restruant quality. Dont eat here for tasty food. Eat here for ease when you're really hungry.</text>

Welcome back HomeTown Buffet. Missed you after you closed in Pinole.So glad to have made the trip to Fairfield. The prices have changed, but you still get what you pay for. The meatloaf and the baked fish were a little dry. These are my only complaints.
Otherwise, keep improving and your fans will all be returning. lol<//Text>

The floors were terribly dirty, not a single person came to our table to clear plates the entire time we were there. Half the food and condiments were empty and still not filled by the time we left. I understand this when understaffed but they had workers everywhere and they had less than half the seats filled so no reason for it. Food was what you expect from a large chain buffet, prefrozen but fully cooked and edible but about all it has going for it.< /Text></record>

The bread was stale, the rice was half undercooked, everything was disgusting. I could've went to a gas station and picked up food that tastes better than this. The environment was just awful. Never going back.</Review>< pics>

Very very bland food and dry meats ended up just having a single taste of most things and left disgusted. Only one item was ok and that was the sweet and sour orange chicken.<//review>

<Text>At 10:00 am the breakfast is not that good, due to lack of replenishment of certain foods. Waffles, pancakes, eggs, bacon. It seems they cannot keep up with the demands to replace.
I guess you have to get there at 8:00am</Text>< name>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>Do not use a bank card here!😠 I walled into restaurant and ordered lunchtime buffet. Mgr charged me $12.47  for buffet and ice tea. I pay him with my bank card .I go to restroom to wash up and get a notification from my bank reguarding the purchase. So why did he charge my bank $14.97!😬 So I brought his attention to the over charge. He swears he didn't do it. I contact my bank ,and they say he did. So I demand my overcharge! He refuses. So I call police to make a report of incident. They refuse to acknowledge my claim. Refuse to make a report ,refuse to address me nor allow me to report the theft. Then they (Fairfield Police) tell the mgr that if I cause any further trouble ,to call them back and they will escort me out!!😨😬 So the restaurant over charged me for my meal and got to keep my money . I didn't eat ,out of disgust and anger. I was taken advantage of by Hometown buffet. They are thieves.! Beware!!!!</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

FIRST TIME HERE , JUST LEFT 5 MINUTES AGO WAS IN THERE FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES AND IT WAS BY FAR THE WORST FOOD I HAVE EVER EATEN!! MADE MY STOMACH HURT AND VOMITTED RIGHT AWAY AFTER LEAVING, LEFT WITHOUT FINISHING MY PLATE . THIS PLACE IS DISGUSTING I WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE EVER AGAIN. FOOD IS TERRIBLY DRY AND EVERYTHING LOOKED AS IF THEY JUST MIXED WHATEVER THE HELL THEY HAD IN KITCHEN TO MAKE A DISH. EMPLOYEES LOOKED UNPROFESSIONAL AND SWEATY , PULLING UP THEIR PANTS AND REFILLING THE FOOD 🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮 GET IT TOGETHER , IF THERE WAS A NEGATIVE STAR YOUVE EARNED IT!!!< /Review>

Honestly very bad service, food and cleanliness. The food at 5pm was cold and clearly been out for too long. Instead of using clean heating pans they just keep refilling them so you get chunks of old food. Somehow they even figured out a way to mess up the instant mashed potatoes. No desert out for customers either and nobody around to ask. I really felt like I was inconvenience from staff. I'm a pretty easy going person and I understand thing aren't always easy, but at if your going to charge people that much money for crappy food, I'll pass. Been coming here for years and I won't be coming back<//Text>

I would give this place no stars if possible. I walked in and the GM, Marc Brochansky was dealing with a complaint from one of the customers. The customer informed the GM that he would be alerting Corporate of how they were treated and the GM was angry. He proceeded to issue a racial slur saying “My names spelled Marc with a C, comprende?” The Hispanic customer immediately grew angry and called the man racist. The GM ran into the customers face shouting that he’s not racist and this that and the other and at this point I ran and separated the two grown men as fellow employees just watched in awe. I have never felt so disgusted.< /Review>

The staff is top notch friendly & helpful but the corporate office does not support the restaurant.  There is poor food planning.  On weekends they will run out of certain food products including the meat & poultry.  The bowl of new salad mix that was recently introduced is frequently empty.    The soup bar is not filled regularly & soup plates are not always available.  Many times you have to wait to collect your meal items because there are not enough plates, cups & utensils on hand at peak meal hours.  It appears the equipment is in disrepair as staff claims the dishwasher can not handle demand & the ice cream machine is malfunctioning.   Most of the time the ice cream machine is a dirty mess.   The beverage bar is out of ice & cups more times than acceptable.   The restaurant could use a makeover.  The lighting in dining area needs to be modernized.  The ceiling needs to be cleaned & brightened.  The open ceiling tiles need to be closed to keep the dirt & dust from circulating through the sub-ceiling into the dining area.  The walls need to be repainted a brighter color to make the place feel friendly & modern.   Some of the wall pictures need to be removed & updated.  This is not Horn & Hardart or Howard Johnsons.  In the warm months the management needs to do a better job keeping the mosquitoes out of the restaurant.  They hang at the front window area all day.  There is no bug control here. This restaurant's operation brings the chains reputation down & keeps away potential patrons.   If it wasn't for the reasonable prices & the frequent discounts offered most people would boycott this location.   The Bakersfield, CA  location is a model restaurant they should try to copy here.<//text>

But when I was there either it was too busy or the cooks were to slow. Not much food/selection was out when I was there.

The food is nothing fancy what you would expect that a Hometown buffet but it makes a difference from one to the  Other help people does their job whether they care or not there seems to be a new or manager he was a working around helping  every buddy, cooking, cleaning.  I was quite impress which also reflected on the employees that were around Him there has  Been 3 sisters working there for a long time that seemed to run the morning shift and they are absolutely amazing I hope they never get ride of those 3 girls But definitely better since new management came on
New day is January 2018
Came it at night for dinner
Sad no service t all most areas were dirty
No plates to be found
No clean silverware
Dirty barthrooms
no one ever come to our table despite being on the table next to us talking to the other guest
I'd think about other options before coming in t night ever again
Like i.mention before
This place is made great by luz Mila and her two sisters please never let them go they are the only best thing you have going for this place</Text>

Haven't been here for a few years, and it should have been longer, now its never again. The ONLY thing that was decent from the meat carver was the turkey. The roast beef was so dry, it soaked up all the au jus. The reason for the 1 star was the turkey, but that certainly doesn't compensate the dinner price.  It would be best to just go up the freeway too The Nugget and grab a couple of steaks, or Dennys.</text>

<text>Impressed. Went in on a Saturday night and everything is actually pretty calm and relaxed. Wait staff is very good for a buffet type place. Nobody has ralphed since we got here. Food is hot and fresh.

Great deserts.  Will visit again no question about it. Even traveling from Napa.< /text>< gmapID>

< review>
Great discount for active/retired/veteran military personnel on Monday nights! Most discount coupons are are trivial at best, except Thursday nights kids eat for $1.99 with a paying adult (limit two kids per paying adult).  On-line page depicts meatballs with spaghetti, but I have never seen meatballs with the spaghetti!  Beverage option with a meal are pricey!  When it was JJ North's, beverages were included with your meal.  I also liked JJ North's pocket menus!  When a beverage, or milk runs out, they are slow to adress it, if at all.  Usually a decent selection of food.<//review>

I don’t really like HomeTown Buffet but my man does. It really doesn’t have any real food to choose from for the price. I would rather go to Golden Corral.< /text>

<text>the more often I visit your Fairfield establishment the more I insult my intelligence and taste buds. but even more as a culinaires I insult my learned and professional status as a teaching chef, restaurant management and development and all aspects of food preperation and presentation. your food quality and taste leaves a lot to be desired and or bragged about. the silver and plates and bowls can be found always in need of being return for recleaning, very sad here. most of the times your salad green are cut and presented with browning ends and near wilted and rotten at times, like nearly every visit. management has been bad for a long time now. the rest rooms are always filthy, I just don't know why the public heath hasn't gotten to your business as yet. you people need to bring all of your restaurants up to latest standard, ie Sizzlers restaurants. very disappointing. try harder, pick up the action, do better, it can only help.<//text><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80851427906335a5:0x198fbf17ada26692</GmapID></record>

I was here in a Friday night, not busy and most of the food areas were empty that's not good for a buffet, customers want to get here and eat, don't wait for the food to be brought out.</Text>

(Translated by Google) For those who want a bit of everything I will not say it is the best but yes, the food is good from breakfast to lunch.
The waitresses treat you with great kindness.
the bathrooms are fine I will not say that they look good but the times that I have gone I find them clean.

Para los que quieren un poco de todo no diré que es lo más bueno pero sí,  la comida esta buena desde el desayuno al almuerzo .

los baños esta bien no diré que se miran bien pero las veces que é ido los encuentro limpios.< /text>
