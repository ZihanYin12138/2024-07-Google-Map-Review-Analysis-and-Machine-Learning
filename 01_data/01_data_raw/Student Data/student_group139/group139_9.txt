<review>Refused free tap water even though I had just bought a hot dog there. They don’t have to? I don’t have to give them a good review or buy there. Kudos to their neighbor, Panda Express for cheerfully providing Pink’s customer water. Nobody should be refused water. It’s the humane thing to do.< /review><user_id>101678361110967001170</user_id>< gmapID>

Bottom line: the fries and the dogs hit the spot.
We tried Pink's Hot Dogs and I can see why all the celebrities are enjoying these sausages. They're tasty, simple, and with a chili recipe that doesn't over complicate a good dog. Fries were delicious too, we got the orginal chili dog and cheese fries with bacon.
Staff: super nice Price: $ Yum?: Simply, yes! .<//Text>

<text>So many choices. I had them make me a bacon wrapped hotdogs with no bun. It hit the spot. This location has so much to offer being its in Universal Studios Citywalk.

Wish I could have tried their food. They were out of ingredients (including meat) and refused to substitute items to make up for it. Don't bother.< /review>

< Review>
Checking city walk out with my boyfriend, we decided to try out Pinks there. First things first, this is not like the original, it was more of a commercial fast food joint. If you've ever had the original, you know their hot dogs have that char and flavor from a grill which this place lacked.

We got the ozzy spicy dog and it was ok. The hot dog didn't taste grilled rather boiled and the toppings were like any other fast food guac and nacho cheese. Overall, this place doesn't compare to the original, probably never coming back to the one at City Walk. Overall, two stars because although it didn't live up to the original it was an ok hot dog.<//Review>

Great option for a filling bite on a budget. This one has the nicer people and I've never seen anyone at this location on their phones and not wash hands and all that. I see constant hand washing, smiles, and quick service. Plus, if I have 4 dogs and ask for foil, they give me enough here..< /Review>

Overrated. Go for the basic, smaller dogs. The Ozzy is a disgusting mess that instantly falls apart when you touch it. I couldn't physically take more than a bite without it becoming a salad on my plate. The dog itself is okay, the toppings way too much, but the experience was awful and there's no forks to have made it a little worthwhile< /Text>

I would definetly recommend coming here! Way less crowded than the one in melrose. We came during the week so there was no line at all. Even though they don't have as much options I experienced an exeptional service. I wanted a specific hot dog they usually do not have on their menu & the owner himself helped me get it personalized. They were not only very nice but also really took time to get exactly what I wanted and even offered me a 10% discount.

Fries were good but the bacon on my Mulholland dog was soggy and the mushrooms looked and tasted like they came from a can. My husband liked his Bacon Burrito dog so 3 stars for the fries and his dog.<//text>

(Translated by Google) You can eat hot dogs that are popular with celebrities and have delicious chili sauce that is not spicy. Spicy French fries are also delicious.

<text>(Translated by Google) The old hot dog shop has a special taste of the stars.
Although it is a bit salty for me, it is undeniably very delicious.

老牌熱狗店，還有明星特製口味。

<review>(Translated by Google) The branch of the legendary store that Eddie Murphy is said to have visited for a week. Chili dogs aren't too spicy and some people may find them fluffy, but they go great with sausages and are addictive. This kind of taste is rarely seen in Japan, so if you go to Hollywood, please stop by.

(Original)
かのエディ・マーフィも1週間通い詰めたと言われる伝説の店の支店。チリドッグはあまり辛くはなく、人によってはもったりしていると感じるかも知れないが、ソーセージとの相性が抜群で中毒性がある。こういう味は日本では中々お目にかかれないから、ハリウッドに行ったら是非寄ってみて頂きたい。< /review></record>

Great way to enter Yosemite. Breathtaking views. Beware that it is only open certain times of the year. When we went it was open & clear but there was only an hour in the morning and another in the afternoon where you were allowed through. Check the park website for details</Review>

A stunning drive over the mountain which at a height of nearly 10,000 feet, was quite literally, breathtaking! (Seriously, don’t underestimate the effects of increased altitudes if like us you’re from a relatively low-lying country. Drinking extra water does help though.)
The drive up just demands a number of stops to take photos, and the drive down into Yosemite is no different. We managed to get through before the first serious snows of the winter, but it’s always best to check if the pass is actually open as they don’t plough the road!
Just gorgeous!<//review>

This pass from Lee Vining to Yosemite has a lot to offer. Its a long drive, but definitely worth it. During day time, you will pass various lakes and sceneries. At nighttime, you can opt to go to a stop and watch the milky way and look for shooting stars.< /Text>

While returning to California one summer, our car overheated on Tioga Pass. At the pullout, we stopped to add water to the radiator and rest a little. Mom made coffee for dad, Grandpa and I walked around, while Grandma say in the hot car. Dad and I loved being out of the car smelling the fresh air with hints of pine and bear clover.<//review>

<date>1569679917007< /date><rate>5< /rate><text>This is a gorgeous road. It stretches from Lee Vining to the west on a pass which goes all the way to Yosemite.  There are lakes and creeks and the best time to take photos is during fall or first snow.

The road is very windy and steep so take it slow.  During this time of year (not sure if this is all times) you will be required to stop and pay I believe $35 per car at the 12 mile mark.

The drive however for those 12 miles is worth it.  You can turn around and not pay.

I highly recommend taking this pass if you are up at the Mammoth Lakes area or Mono Lake.

We didn't have much time, so we only took a few photos, but there are so many cool places to check out.  Totally cool drive!</text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<text>I'm giving this rating, because you'd think a person would have a kind heart, but not here. The amount of money these toll booths make off of the population, they couldn't even have a kind heart to a person in need..

Amazing views along the road. Inform yourself about the road conditions. It's closed between November and May because of snow. We went end of October and it already closed over 3 days because of the weather but reopened. Ask in your Motel, watch the information signs in e.g. Mariposa or call the rangers. To get to the other side of the mountsins the detour is about 7 hours when tioga pass is closed.<//Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) It’s a beautiful route, be prepared for the fact that very often we’ll stop taking photos. There are pre-arranged places for this, there is usually no need to avoid cars left on a narrow road. $ 30 is the collection cost for an average car, this is valid for 7 days, unfortunately there is no easy pass ticket.

(Original)
Gyönyörű útvonal, fel kell rá készülni, hogy igen gyakran meg fogunk állni fényképezni. Erre előre kialakított helyek vannak, általában nem kell a szűk úton otthagyott autókat kerülgetni. 30 $ a behajtási költség egy átlagos személyautónak, ez 7 napra érvényes, sajnos egyszerű áthaladó jegy nincs.< /review><Rate>5< /Rate>< username>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I think that in any road trip through this area you can not miss the Tioga Road, the truth is that it is awesome! It's difficult to describe it, you can only understand it!

(Original)
Crec que a qualsevol road trip per aquesta zona no pot faltar passar pel tioga road, la veritat és que és impressionant! És difícil descriure-ho, només es pot entendre fent-lo!< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>Staff is pretty knowledgable on pools and supplies. Would give them 5 stars but they discontinued a part for my pool filter and don't make it anymore. Not the stores fault but the company itself.< /text></record></dataset><record>

The staff are friendly, helpful & technically very competent.
Their free pool water test & analysis and the recommended products, plus a computerized procedure report have resulted in a crystal clear pool at minimal expense. They are also very knowledgeable about equipment that you may require. A thoroughly professional organization !<//Review>

The only reason I gave a 1 star was because zero stars was not an option... I am not even sure where to begin with the terrible service I received... so I will keep it simple. $700 later and 5 weeks after order date I am stuck with a custom spa cover that was made incorrectly.  The manager refuses to fix the problem and says that I am the one at fault... But that is hard to believe when the measurements I gave them for the spa cover (on my order form) are not the measurements that were delivered.  This experience was terrible, it took over 5 weeks to receive the cover (they admit they had trouble ordering the cover and had to make some measurement changes... Weird why didn't they call me to check the measurement changes????? instead they just made them up), a 25 minute wait to sign my credit card authorization because they could not find my order... I'll just leave it at that... The management here is terrible. Save yourself some time and go somewhere else even if it is out of town. My name is Jenny Stauts if anyone from Leslies pools would like to call me to fix this probelm correctly.< /text>

If your looking to save money during pool season search your local area for mom and pop owned stores there cheaper give friendlier service .Leslie's water test service is set up to recommend things you need and things you dont need they do this for extra store sales I found out the hard way buying the extra things I didn't need<//review>

<Review>This place was so fire! Doesn't taste commercialized and everything is flavorful. My favorite was the garlic noodles with craw fish.

Overall, an okay experience. I visited the Costa Mesa location recently and loved it so much, I checked out the Chino location!

Ordered their pork sandwich (delicious). Asked for Sriracha sauce and they didn’t have any (Costa Mesa location had it).

Beautiful Interiors and option to sit outside. Tables weren’t been bussed/cleaned and I had to wipe it down myself before enjoying my meal.

I would come back and give it a 2nd chance.<//review>

A bit salty but entire menus were good.< /review>

<text>Overall the quality of the food was really good, everything was delicious! The food was ready pretty promptly and was hot & ready.

My only thing was that everything seemed a little pricey. For everything we spent $37 total. Also I was not aware of all the ingredients in the rice bowl, so maybe that's why with the added chicken it nearly cost $9 together.

But I totally recommend this place for dishes like this. Everything was super good, and we will probably come back again if we crave it.< /text>< Pictures>

< review>
Came here last week at 12:34am and the lady told me they don't take any orders after 12:30am either inside or on the phone. So I spared them from a review but now I won't because they didn't want to take a phone order before 12:30am I called at like 12:20am. Now she told me the frill was closed because they cleaned it and they won't be taking any orders after 12:30 that involves the grill. I was very upset and annoyed at such laziness from the workers and the lies they have told me im sure it was the same lady too. Her name was Kim supposedly not sure but I got the phone call recorded on my part. I love the food here but these late night workers are lazy and useless costing the restaurant money for sure. I hope a manager sees this because who ever owns the place is loosing money and customers.</review>

<Review>I didnt see the nk slider so i decided to get it. It wasnt amazeballs but it was good ( there are 2 sliders). a little sweet with the mushrooms and onions. the garlic noodles are fire with the green sauce just dont put too much. the egg rolls are totally meh, needed sauce.

last time i tried the crawfish pasta that was pretty fire too. pretty good place, love that its open so late.< /Review>< Rate>

I’ve gone here frequently for lunch during work and have enjoyed every menu I’ve tried. Great price, healthy options, delicious food, and quick service. If you enjoy Vietnamese food (or any Asian food if you haven’t had Vietnamese), definitely give this place a try.< /Review>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Text>When they say garlic fries they were not kidding, the aroma and rich flavor of garlic was almost too much, not sure I would call them Cajun however. Adding the Bulgogi Steak was definitely a must, however I wish they added a bit more meat for the additional fee of $5.50. The pork egg rolls were a delight and worth adding to any order. The pork buns were delicious but a bit small and probably best eaten onsite. The grilled pork sandwich (banh mi) was fresh and tasty but lacked a bit of spice (jalapeno) I'm used to when getting this type of sandwich. The NK Sliders were lathered in bulgogi steak sauce and also another item probably best eaten onsite. Overall the staff was polite and I thank them for being open late.  I would like to try more of the menu and look forward to visiting again soon.<//Text><name>Eric Garcia</name></record></dataset><record>

<review>If I could give this place 5 stars I would but truly the wings togo are soggy by the time you get home. Their sandwiches are extremely good and well served.(I'm talking portions).

<GmapID>0x80c333064079945b:0x91c97e2182f03fd5</GmapID><text>Overall the quality of the food was really good, everything was delicious! The food was ready pretty promptly and was hot & ready.

My only thing was that everything seemed a little pricey. For everything we spent $37 total. Also I was not aware of all the ingredients in the rice bowl, so maybe that's why with the added chicken it nearly cost $9 together.

But I totally recommend this place for dishes like this. Everything was super good, and we will probably come back again if we crave it.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrcWeYoGZ4e3ZZegLwdEGHvZzY1vgXli-B6BmO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOe-UuwgvPNfEUJSCVOpHuff_IygV8ZZuOknZL7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfbJ5Rqj493vmtUYsrZLWWHwlkJAEcsaPiJ61A=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMsoBr7gQNVjARIhMxtCLJmFUtM_1XVOuWbxuxP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< date>

Looked interesting as it's been a while since we stepped out of our comfort zone and tried fusion *insert national cuisine*. Menu choices are limited so you won't get stuck standing there trying to decide what to have.

My two girls ordered bolgogi rice bowl, I ordered crawfish with spicy Cajun sausages over a bed of pasta with this creamy garlic sauce that you drizzle over and mix it up.

Wife got bulgogi over garlic noodles.

Pricing:  cost per order was setting $10 so it was reasonable considering that you get a decent amount of food.

Covid planning:  they separated the booths to every other one so thankfully we were able to find a spot for our family to sit.

The bulgogi bowl cane with some lettuce, pickled daikon and carrots and some sauce to mix your rice up with the meat. If you've never tried bulgogi you will be in for a treat as it's got the savory and slight sweetness to it that makes you want to eat and eat.

The crawfish Cajun sausage pats with the creamy garlic sauce was pretty damn amazing. Had just the right amount of spice and my son and I dusted our plate in a hot ny minute.

Definitely give them a go since they would really benefit from the place being recently opened before the Covid shutdown.<//Review>< time>

Not only is there outdoor seating by a water fountain to relax the place is open crazy late past midnight. Delicious found that is flavorful, healthy and respectfully priced long as you dont go overboard...which is hard because their garlic noodles, rice bowls and sides are soooooooo good. Hidden menu hint btw, you can order a fried egg (or eggs like I do) to add to any dish for an added punch of wow factor 🤤<//Review>

I can't say enough good things about the food. I ordered bulgogi short rib steak and also grilled pork sandwich with cucumber lemonade and they were all amazing.The atmosphere is really laid back. They have some nice calming tunes on, and it makes the place really cozy.The working staff was also very nice and friendly.Definitely recommend this place to everyone.< /text><Date>1575235058466<//Date><GmapID>0x80c333064079945b:0x91c97e2182f03fd5< /GmapID>< Pictures>

The food is outstanding here. I visited this place an hour ago and got an excellent experience. The working staff is the best I have ever seen. When I entered the place they greeted me in a very polite and friendly manner. They were very helpful and guided me through the whole menu and I got my best choice. The grilled pork sandwich and garlic noodles were out of this world. I had never tasted such a fresh meat before.I will definitely return here again in order to try the rest of the menu. Thanks very much.<//text>

Had the Garlic Noodles, Pork Banh Mi, the chicken wings and Cajun Garlic Fries.  The noodles were a little bland and the BM was just okay.  Best things were the wings.  They were crispy and was better without the sauce.</Text>

Casual quick serve place that is conveniently open late. The food is very flavorful! You know the food is too good when you forget to take a picture. I would suggest the bulgogi beef short rib rice, cajun fries, and pork noodles.< /review>

-1 star because EVERYTHING had a handful of cilantro on top.

-1 star because EVERYTHING needed sauce

I ordered garlic noodles with chicken breast. That came with a handful of cilantro on top and the noodles needed more sauce and more garlic flavor.

Bulgogi sandwich was kinda dry compared to other bulgogi I've had at other places. Needed more sauce.

The wings were perfect the way they were. No complaints there.

Cajun fries, I added bulgogi & a fried egg since that was recommended. Nothing to write home about.

Will I come back? If I'm hungry and in the area already.<//review>

<Review>I ordered 3 food items, they gave me the bulgogi fries and pasta but said the crawfish pasta would be a bit longer whoch i did not mind. After waiting 10 minutes I asked the cashier if my plate was ready, she then asked the chef who had not even made my order. By the time I recieved and tried my plate I had been waiting 20 minutes. The plate itself was barely any good. I would not go here again.<//Review>< user>

Good spot for day out, famous for balloon ride and farmer's market, ample of parking space, need not worry for parking, on weekend reach a bit early for balloon ride passes, i have not got as all the slots are fully booked for the day.< /text>

<Review>I didn't get on the carousel, but I did go up on the helium balloon. The helium balloon gives you the feel of a hot air balloon but with the comfort of knowing you're tethered. You go up to 400ft I believe. It was super high for me since I'm afraid of heights. You can walk around if you like. The pilot was very fun and friendly. He helped me get over my jitters. He gave us a mini sight seeing experience from above. I definitely recommend this experience especially for people like me that are afraid of heights.</Review>< Resp>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>I'd give it more Stars than 5. One of a kind park in the world in our backyard! Absolutely huge and incredibly well maintained. It's truly one of the hidden secrets or yet to be discovered secrets of Orange County let alone Irvine! I HIGHLY recommend  visiting and bring kids, family and friends here. Be prepared to walk as there is a lot to walk. I suggest biking as you can see more stuff around. The air-baloon and timeline walk is simply mindblowing!</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0gU_VY5qZ0ld_WF24SC6zz4LTMp0lszNQzcCt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzocdHnCznyxkyfCENZ8gHwWDlzSquiDsCXWJj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1767aWJHlWfqXY6x1I_pW2z64WGdwHoGN2iWM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlL-g8to5By1ZDHHtLdKZ43F8kUuFXzEJO5J-o=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< response>

We were there around 7:30pm hoping to ride the giant balloon but they said it is not going up tonight due to wind... the front desk advised to always call in advance and best times are around 10am. My son didn't get too disappointed as he got to go on the carousel at least which was beautiful and had great music.  Keep in mind the visitor center is only providing information about the great park and not the city of Irvine.< /review>

<text>This park is super cool, there's more than 20 fields for rent, a carousel, arts, food trucks, on Saturday or sundays I think there is a small farmers market they have little play areas too. Highly recommend bringing the family here.</text>< pics>

Sent in my Ariat lace-up paddock boots (22 years old and *well* worn) and a beloved pair of fashion boots I had gotten overseas (also well worn). Both were returned in like-new condition. I am extremely pleased with the quality of the work - both the look and the comfort. The pice was very reasonable. I highly recommend.<//Review>

Amazing from start to finish. The only place recommended to replace the soles on my expensive hiking boots, (molded soles) was nushoe. It took awhile from sending off and return, but what comes back looks brand-spanking-new. Not only are your soles new, but your whole boot is spiffed up and new laces installed. I bought the package for that. Easy walk through system where you print out the prepaid FedEx label to send them with, is very helpful. Would definitely do again when necessary.</Text>

<Review>I sent my shoes in the week before Christmas. They are the most comfortable boots a person could own, bought in Berlin and worn three years since. They came back new and familiar-- with all the old comfort, but refreshed with new solid soles. It took about six weeks, but who's going anywhere? They wrote twice, reassuring me that my shoes had arrived and were in process. Thank you for giving me my well loved shoes back!</Review>< Pictures>

I thought it was a little expensive, but after I considered the price I pay for a new pair, I decided the price was valid. Quick turnaround and fairly easy process. My boots came back just as comfortable as when I sent them in, but much cleaner. I really liked the look they had. Used and worked, but very well taken care of. I’ve already sent in another old pair I had laying around.<//text>

I'd purchased a pair of Doc Marten's at a thrift store that were broken in, but the sole had started to come off after wearing them for a week. I tried shoe goo, which didn't work long, then took them to a local shoe repair store, but his solution didn't work long either. I ended up sending them to Nushoe and they did a beautiful job! I love the repair work they did on my boots, and now they'll last another 20 years. Highly recommend!< /text>

<Review>When I first heard about the shoes, I was very skeptical on how it'sadvertised on social media.  But, I gave them a chance and purchased a pair. I read the reviews and I ordered half a size up than normal. I could have gone a full size up, but this will work. The comfort level of the shoes are very good and it's very flexible. The quality of the shoes looked good too. I wear an shoe insert for my heel pain and it is still comfortable. Definitely recommend them< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Had Older pair of work shoes that fit like a glove.  I have trouble finding shoes that fit me well.  They were bought in the 1990's.  The soles needed to be replaced.  Sent to Nushoe and WOW came back looking great and feel great.  Only negative is the soles are wearing down pretty quickly.  I would pay more for a more durable one.  Over all VERY HAPPY.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

My son's boots had not been worn in year and the soles were bad. You fixed the soles and cleaned up the boot to look brand new. He loves 💘 them. It was worth the price. The time to get them fix took longer then expected  but it was right after Christmas and Covid19. We are still very pleased with the service.<//Text>

Sent out a pretty worn pair of Thorogoods and got the total re build package....a little pricey but compared to a new pair, could be a bargain.....received the boots back and was definitely surprised and pleased with the rework. Boots were almost like new. Will definitely be sending .ore boots to this place for refurbishment
Thank you for a fine job.</Review>

I was skeptical of sending my work boots in, but glad I took a leap of faith.  It was convenient completing the work order online and printing the shipping label.  Customer service was very helpful tracking the status of my boots, and the workmanship is superb.  Very satisfied with my experience.  Thank you!<//text>

I’ve used them four times for my flight boots and will continue to do so. Much cheaper than buying a new pair of flight boots and when they’re done with them, it’s like getting a brand new pair of boots that are already broken in.

My only critique is that they recently changed the type of laces they send back with the boots. They used to provide nice brown laces to go with my brown boots, but now it’s just cheap black laces so now I just buy laces from a different vendor.

Highly recommended.</review>

<review>I have been wearing Thorogood (Union Made in America) for decades. They no longer make them in my size. I sent my oldest most beat up pair to NuShoe as a test. They did a great job. I've been wearing the resoled boots everyday for 6 months. The boots are holding up well. I'll be a return customer for sure. Thanks.<//review>< pictures>

Called Thorogood themselves & they referred me to this company because they are no longer making 4E sizes. This was my first time having a pair of boots resoled & Nushoe was very professional from start to finish. Very happy & if I had one complaint to say it would be that I wish they were Union like myself & that's more of a complaint towards Thorogood for even referring them. I was hesitant & like to support Unions hints why I purchase Thorogood boots. I'm not happy that they are not making 4E sizes but we are in a pandemic now & things have changed. After having them resoled I have to say I was super happy & will deal with them again. I have also told other Brothers about Nushoe that are going to be in my situation soon. They ask if they are Union & I have to say no but convince them they are good people & do great work. Us Union boys like supporting mom & pop small business as well hoping as they grow they will go Union someday. I.B.E.W. #401 MEMBER< /Text>

<Text>Shame I can not give negative stars. Horrible horrible company. They have had my boots for months I have sent email after email after email and none have been replied to. I called to find out they were out of the items to repair my boots.  They would be restocked in May here we are 3 weeks into May and nothing still. They just ignore customers and blow them off.  Besides having my booths for 4 months now.  bad customer service would be an improvement because they have no customer service and these guys are representing ARIAT (Which is an excellent Company) to bad Ariat doesn't cut all ties with them and find someone else to use their name and authorize them to repair their products.  If you can find someone else to do the repairs then do so. picture shows at least 12 of the emails sent to and from of them not responding except one time and then nothing at all ever again..............< /Text>< pictures>

I am not typically one to write a review, but I’m bummed...I sent my husband’s Thorogoods in to get a complete restoration. I was not pleased with job that was done when I received the boots back two months later, so I emailed and never received a response from the company. We ended up getting rid of the boots because my husband disliked them so much after the restoration. I had designated that I wanted a call if his exact sole was not in stock, but never received that call and ended up with a chunky, white, 70’s looking disco sole instead of the sleek comfortable sole he had become accustomed to in his original boot.

Communication is lacking and I wouldn’t pay $125 for another restoration. I’d rather spend more and just get a new pair and be satisfied.</review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>I have a pair of boots that I love and the model is no longer produced.  I found Nushoe and thought I would try it. They assured me the boots would be repaired with original materials or better than original. They kept me informed of progress through the tracking feature on their site. When I received the boots back they looked and felt like new (minus cuts or major scratches that I had made in leather due to wear). I only hope I keep them in good enough condition to have them reconditioned again if need be. Great first experience.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

I think the whole process took about a month from the time I initially contacted NuShoe to when I got my boots back. Very good service, excellent communication, and fast turnaround. I will definitely look to them for the next pair I need rebuilt, or repaired.</review>< pics>

Nushoe put new soles on a 29 year old pair of UGS.  Staff was thorough and polite.  Quality of work was excellent and repairs appear to be very durable.  I am about to have a pair of ECCO boots resoled as well.  Great Service.</text>

<Name>Megan Fitzgerald<//Name><Review>I wanted to give a good review, but my shoes were ruined. And they don't make them anymore. I loved my shoes and I was hoping a full restore would give them the love they needed. Instead, my shoes came back with a new sole and heel cap, but the same old dirty insole laid over a newer layer of padding. This  made the toe area of my shoes too cramped and I could not wear my shoes anymore. Would not recommend.<//Review>< Pictures>

I received my resoled Chippewa boots on 19 September 2020 and have worn them everyday since then. As of 13 May 2021 I have walked  1,167 miles on the new soles and they look like they are good for another thousand. I asked Nushoe to give me a longer lasting sole than the factory Vibram and they put on a Goodyear sole.

Very pleased - I'll probably send the boots to Nushoe again early next year for another Goodyear resole.< /text>

The entire process is about as effortless as possible.

Fill out the forms, ship the boots and wait for them to return. The wait not very long.

The tracking system is easy to use and a good way to keep yourself updated.<//text>

I ordered a pair of dude shoes that I couldn’t find anywhere else, and I’m definitely happy with my experience. They were the right price (not jacked up to $70-$80 like Amazon), had free shipping, and was at my house in just a few days. I will for sure be ordering again!!!< /review>

I have sent several pairs of shoes for resoling and rejuvenation over several years and one pair of boots 3 times now.  The work is always excellent quality and the staff who work on the shoes are top notch. I have recommended Nushoe to my family and friends and they have been very pleased as well.  I have talked to the staff there on the phone and they are knowledgeable and very pleasant and professional.< /text>

When I sent my boots to be re-soled, I thought,they'll never make those right again.
I was wrong, they were re-soled with a high density material that lasts longer than the original type.
My boots were pretty beat up when I sent them.
Nushoe did an awesome job of making my boots look great and better than the original. Plus you don't have to break the boots in again, they are already molded to your feet. Like getting an old friend back.<//review>

5 year old ramblers that take 10,000 - 18,000 steps per day. This is the 3rd set of soles, 2nd replacement by nushoe. Nushoe also replaced the heel guard inside the boot. They are the best and the reconditioning makes them feel better than new. Nothing worse than a great set of leather uppers with no way to resole. I hope to keep these going as long as the leather holds up.< /review>

Using the service via HAIX, was easy and painless.  Only complaint I have is the boots I don't feel were repaired as requested and specified in the description of service offered.  Re-soling was flawless, the toe cap was supposed to be repaired or replaced with the stitching as well and that was not completed.</review>

<rating>2< /rating><text>The re-sole of my shoes was nicely done. However the refinish of the upper was not. I purchased the chairman's craft, and based on the work description, felt that was to be most appropriate for my shoes. However the upper was not buffed, still had all the original creases from my normal use, and had a dusty appearance perhaps from dried conditioner. I had to polish and buff my own shoes when I got them back.

All total I paid 130 with taxes and shipping for the work. Based on what was advertised and the results I got I must say I am disappointed.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1615391843874, 'text': 'Hi Micah, I’m sorry to hear about your bad experience.

I had a favorite pair of Birkenstock sandals, and the sole needed to be replaced.  As it turned out later, I also needed new cork beds (which added $40 to the cost).  However, overall, I could not be more satisfied with the result -- essentially, a new pair of Birkenstocks.  The repair job was truly awesome, and I was very pleasantly surprised by the fantastic job NuShue did.

I wish I could include a picture, but just imagine what a brand new pair looks like -- that's how good a job they did!<//text>

I was hesitant.. but my boots came back like new, except that they were already perfectly broke in. Will definitely be using Nushoe again.
Thank you!, to all you who work through these old smelly boots. You do an excellent job!< /text>

Their work is excellent.  When you get your shoes back they look like when you bought them.  I have used them for several years and always
have been helpful and considerate.</Review>

This is my second pair of work boots I had redone with Nushoe.  Their work is great and the finished product is as good as new.  I appreciate them fixing the one pair that had scuffed toes.  They placed an attractive leather cover over the top.  Great work.</Review>

<rating>3<//rating><text>The work that was done was very good, including new soles, new footbed inserts and buffing and restitching where needed. I would have given a perfect rating had they not missed a very obvious needed replacement of a defective eyelet that stuck out in a way that made it useless. Less critical but also annoying was substitution of drab laces for the sporty and more durable originals.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I've used NuShoe for Birkenstock & Finn Comfort shoes . I was very pleased with the quality of the work they did.

Husband was about to throw out his favorite summer shoes until I suggested he send to NuShoe to resole & clean up.

Other than it taking longer than expected , the shoes are almost like new !

Would recommend to anyone who has invested in a good pair of shoes .<//text>

<text>My Finn Comfort hiking boots were refurbished and shipped to me, however I cannot comment on quality of workmanship as my boots were lost in transit. Nushoe gets a 5 star rating for customer service. Without asking the customer service told me that they would replace boots and the new boots arrived shortly afterward. I am disappointed that my boots were lost in transit because after 8 years wear they were broken in to perfection.<//text>< response>

I LOVE my boots. However, maybe I didn't love them the way I should. Just when I thought I was going to painfully find a new pair I ran across Nushoe. I was skeptical at first, but dived in and WOW!!! New soles, New inserts and MY BOOTS! It doesn't get any better than this. No breaking in, no pain, just MY BOOTS with another few years of life. You better believe I will send them back to Nushoe in a few years. Clearly better than a new pair.</review>

Went through everything to get my shoes refurbished. paid the 90 for it. sent them in. Sent them back saying they were unable to refurbish them as they did not met their requirements. However still keep my money and still show in the website my boots are able to be refurbished. I call BS on this and wont ever use you again.</Review>

I was really impressed by the expert craftsmanship. It was hard to believe they were the same boots on the first go around. I highly recommend Nushoe for anyone with a favorite pair of quality footwear. One of my favorite benefits of having footwear renewed is you skip the "break in" period; the leather is already soft asks molded for you! Love you guys & I'll be back, thank you.</Text>< gmap_id>

<text>I had a great experience with Nushoe, Inc. Through a recommendation from Birkenstock USA, I had my Birkenstock soles replaced. Nushoe, Inc., met my expectations and then some.

I am very pleased and will use them again in the future for my Birkenstock repairs.<//text>< userid>

I sent a pair of my 8" Thorogood moc toe waterproof boots to NuShoe through Thorogoods own program and wasnt pleased at all. When I recieved my boots back, almost all of the welt was sanded off in a couple of spots, and the color of "polish" was off and didn't accomplish whatever it was trying to accomplish. They look horrible, and I have only worn them once since.< /review>

I was disappointed to wear out the sole so quickly. More disappointing was the company to replace my soles was located across country in California. I sent my shoes and upon their receipt of my shoes, it took over a month before I received them back. Only to see my shoe laces were in contrasting color and not the same color of the shoes, as purchased.  I do like my shoes and the work that was done to them. But for the price, I'm not sure the long wait for repairs and the contrasting laces are worth the trouble.  I would request black laces to match my shoes please.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>Excellent service! My expensive Thorogoods were in dire need of new treads. I hated the thought of throwing away perfectly good uppers. So I searched online and found Nushoe. What a gem indeed. For a fraction of the cost for a new pair I could re-sole my already broke- in leather boots. I couldn't be more delighted. Thanks Nushoe.<//text>< Rate>

No only did they take over 4 months to resole my boots. They destroyed a $350 pair of boots with poor quality craftsmanship. They cut Into the gortex and leather rendering the boots no longer water proof and just glued their cut closed the repair and soles began to fail after 2 weeks I don't recommend anyone send quality boots to them.</review>

<Review>Shipped my Ariat boots to them and they returned them  with no repairs. Explanation was leather was damaged but leather has no holes and they are well worn boots. Wasted money on shipping coast to coast. Save your money and find someone local to repair.</Review>< Gmap_id>

I sent three pair of Ariat boots to have the original rubber sole put back on. They were returned quicker than I expected and all three pair had a new original sole, new Ariat insoles and the boots had all been polished and looked like the did when I first got them.

I recommend NuShoe if you have any of the brands they resole because they make them new again!</Text>

<text>I highly recommend Nushoe, Inc. I sent two of my favorite pairs of Mayari Birkenstocks to Nushoe to have them resoled, cleaned, and refreshed. They came back in a timely manner looking as good as when I originally purchased them. Nushoe's prices are a great deal for the amount of work they put into my Birkenstocks. I won't send my shoes anywhere else but Nushoe!</text></record>

< review>
HS Trask Chukka Boots.  I tossed them into the supplied bag and shipped them off. Easy.  Months later they came back. Looked great. New vibram soles.  I'm a pharmacist so I don't work in the weather.  Before long the adhesive begins to let go and the sole begins to separate. The part of the shoe the sole attaches to (midsole?) is now pulling away from the boot (leather upper?) so water gets to my toes. The stitching is coming apart.

I believe Nushoe delivered like they said they would.  My issue is with the short time frame from when I got the shoes back to when they started coming apart again.  Is it their fault?  I don't know.  I'm almost 60 and not some teenager who is rough on their footware but I believe they should have lasted longer than they did.</review>

Nushoe resoled and refurbished two pairs shoes for me, an Ecco Seattle Bike Toe Lace-Up and an Ecco Turn GTX Chukka Boot. Both are quality shoes that saw a lot of use the first time around. I am delighted with the results, and they were worth the wait. A more sustainable approach to shoe ownership! I will definitely be going back to Nushoe in the future.< /text>

Many years ago when I purchased sandals the end of a season, I left them in the box with the intent to wear them in the future.  When I did take them out quite a while later, the soles had peeled away.  I had never had this happen before.  So, I took them to a shoemaker who made a mess with the glue--glue leaked out all over.  I thought I would have to garbage the shoes.   I then contacted Nushoe.  I was surprised when they agreed to repair them.  They sent me prepaid mailing instructions,  repaired the sandals, and returned them. There was no charge.   I look forward to wearing my "new" sandals this summer.  Nushoe went above and beyond.<//text>

We sent my husbands shoes to be rebuilt by NuShoe. My husband wore these shoes daily for the previous year. So they needed a lot of work. NuShoes repair resulted in what looked like almost new.

The shoes were expensive when new and he has now had another year of daily use. In any case we would heartily recommend this company!< /Review>

I needed a resole, upper reconditioning and restiching of a leather loop that held a D-shaped lace tensioner in place.  I was happy the restitching was included in the "basic" package price.  The job took a couple weeks and things looked fine.  Unfortunately the restich tore out the second time I wore the shoes.  Actually, the leather edge at the site tore out.  It's too short to attempt anything again, so it's out of the shoelace path again.  The soles and uppers are fine, so thanks for the work, NuShoe.< /review>

Nushoe did a wonderful job repairing and restoring a favorite pair of Birkenstock sandals I've had for years.  They were professional, efficient, and prompt.< /text>

This is my 4rd or 5th time using NuShoe. I have always been pleased with the turnaround and quality of work. Shoes always come back in better shape extending the life of the shoe. I have always purchased shoes that can be re-soled because I know NuShoe will fix them and I can keep wearing them for years.</Text>

<Text>I had a pair of Finn Sandals that I was considering replacing with a new pair. But the cost of a new pair was more than I wanted to spend. I looked online and found NuShoe. For about one third of the cost of a new pair of sandals my sandals were refurbished and looked new after NuShoe returned them to me.< /Text><response>None< /response>< time>

I used Nushoe only because Ariat recommended them, and told me that they would be able to replace the original Dualpro soles. Guess what, they didn't. These boots are made of alligator skin,and I wanted the best they had, but my only option was the western sole. I sent them out in the provided packaging they sent me, with a check for the cost of the service. A few weeks later I got a call asking for payment. Apparently they lost the check. So I sent them another. About a month later they showed up.
I work in western wear retail, so I'm in a pair of cowboy boots every day. The quality of the repair was excellent, but they lost a star for loosing my check and not replacing the outsole with the original style.</Review>

I sent in a pair of Ariat boots with worn out crepe soles and heels. Nushoe replaced the soles with factory replacement soles, polished them up, and returned a pair of boots that looked like new. This is the second time they replaced them on this particular pair of boots, extending the life of them significantly. Great job!<//review>

Nushoe takes my Finn sandals made in Germany that I need for my orthotics and totally repairs them, new rocker soles, replacing any straps, stitching, etc. treats and cleans the leather and sends them back to me looking almost brand new for about 1/4th the cost of new ones. Quick and easy.< /Review>

Did great job reconditioning worn Ariat Work Hogs.
Exact Ariat sole. Nice job reconditioning leather on boot. However surprised and dissapointed interior lining not repaired broken side heel supports or torn insole. Was considering a 2nd pair for rework. Will try local boot maker in Daytona.<//Review>

Six months ago I had Nushoe resole my 6” Thorogood wedge work boots and also bought new ones.  The soles of my old boots were significantly worn on the outside edge and at the heal and the boots were uncomfortable to wear.  I had them repaired to wear for dirty work.  While my new Thorogoods are comfortable and solid so are my resoled boots and they (the resoled boots) are still my go to boots.  I wear my new boots only occasionally.  The repair work was first rate.  My thanks to the repair person.   Also, it’s very good that there is still a company like Nushoe providing this service.</text>

Have been a customer of NuShoe for many years. Quality of shoe "renewals" has been outstanding - shoes feel like they are brand new. NuShoe put extra effort into the small details - nice shine, new stitching where needed, new laces, etc. I will continue to be a customer,! Thank you, NuShoe!</text>

We have used Nushoe for boot repair for many years. They do a great job on repairing boots. Their customer service is excellent. My husband wears airet boot Sedona which the company unwisely quit making. Lucky we kept a couple pair so Nushoe can repair them. I don't know what we will do when they wear out< /review>

They refurbished an old beat down pair of Thorogoods for less than 1/2 the cost of a new pair.
I literally have had multiple compliments from unknowing people that my leather is actually 4+ years  old.

They weren't able to refurbish my boots, though this was through no fault of theirs. The soles of my particular Ariat model were backordered. Nushoe replaced my Ariat's for just the refurbishment fee, and sent back my original boots. Great customer service.<//review>

I wear ECCO Shoes exclusively & have for over 20 years because they are right for my feet.  I have a favorite pair of casual lace and the soles had worn thin but the uppers were still perfect.  I started a search to see if they could be re-soled & found Nu-Shoe.  Made a call, received the shipping info and forwarded the ECCO's.  Timeline, tracking & status of the repair were just as described.  I spoke with several reps during the process who were professional, knowledgeable & answered my questions.  While the Vibram (resoles) are different from the original ECCO, the Vibram will be longer lasting.  I will be sending in several other pair for the same repair.  I am very pleased with Nu-Shoe, their personnel and the repair service which they offer.<//review>

I had a pair of Chippewa 6 inch work boots that I had owned for 20 years. They were used and abused but were my most comfortable boots. There was so little sole left so I thought I'd try Nushoe. They resoled them with vibram mini lug 430 soles and the job done was top notch. A couple of issues though.  For some reason, my boots have become incredibly uncomfortable and don't feel like the same boots. Maybe they need a break in period all over again. Maybe it is the Nushoe insole they put in. Another issue is the leather reconditioning. Originally the leather had a nice matte finish. When I got mine back, the leather had a high sheen. I'm not sure if this is typical or what. Before I pass final judgement, I will be putting these shoes to work again. After a month or so I hope they become my old favorites again. If they stay this uncomfortable, I will be sad I spent the money with Nushoe.<//text>

I had a full restoration done on 2 pairs of Thorogood work boots. The foot bed padding is suppose to be replaced in a full restoration it wasn’t on either pair. Any bad stitching is suppose to be fixed there are spots on each pair of boots that the stitching wasn’t fixed when it clearly needs it and the stitching on the leather they did fix is poorly done. The sole stitching is so close to the edge you can see it in the sole. All together nothing done on these boots shows any sign that Nushoe is a quality boot restoration business. I will not be using there services again and I recommend that you never even try them out. I sent an e mail with pics and haven’t even been contacted by anyone. Poor service in all areas of this business.<//text>

They ruined a $750 pair of mine by trimming too close to the stitching around the sole, leaving them no longer water resistant and changing the shape of the shoe.

< review>
I’m impressed!
I have been buying 2 pairs of boots a year for quite some Time .((Heavy construction lots of hours very hard on my boots  cutting grinding etc))
I decided I would buy a new pair of the same boot and start having my boots repaired instead of constantly replacing them . September 23 I printed my label
October 16 they are back
They look great and the craftsmanship is great .
I will be doing this for as long as I can using 2 pairs of boots so I’m not in here complaining about how long it takes to get them back .  I did a total restore on my thorogood 8 inch work boots it was 125 plus tax and shipping . I believe they were in the 250 range when I bought them that’s 500 dollars a year in boots and now I won’t have to keep buying new boots ! So glad I got this service done ! Thank you<//review>

Mephistos sandals **********

Sent in my 25 year old sandals for an overhaul and  the results are spectacular.  These old sandals have never been more comfortable!!  I didn't know this was possible but since a pair of new ones would cost $300 had to give it a try.   Truly amazing - I give them ten stars.<//text>

I've used them twice, and will never use them again.  It's not worth the time and money to use them.  I will just buy new boots, if they are the only option for resoling.

I've sent the same pair of Ariat boots to them twice.  It's taken over 2 months to get them back each time.  And the first time, they didn't sew the heal liners back in.  I took it to a local cobbler to have that done, as I didn't have months to wait for them to do it.

Their customer service is also horrible.  No interest in being helpful to you what so ever.  I found out the soles needed for my boots was on back order, only after multiple weeks of being told my boots would be done at the end of the week.  Each time offering no apology or caring they were keeping my riding boots half of the season.  On top of that, they still didn't ship out when they said they would, and took more time than they said they would to arrive.

If there was a 0 star option, I would have used it.< /Text>

<Review>Still disappointed with these folks
.
Not satisfied due to returned boots stating leather was to out of shape. I have been using nushoe for about 6 years and I was surprised to open the package and see my same boots not resoled. So I found this union shoe repair shop called: Tulsa Shoe Rebuilders. They are union so this works out for me being I'm a union member out of local 1607. This shop understands how much I love my boots.< /Review>< pics>

Worst company ever! This is a total ripoff. I sent some expensive shoes which cost over $400 dollars. I wanted a tread replacement. I received my shoes back almost 2 months later. They literally cut the old sole off, and butchered my shoes. Even worse the sole was coming off in just 2 days. I called customer service, they said to send them back. My shoes took a month and a half to come back. I could pull the sole of with my hand! STAY AWAY!</text>

<text>I sent in my favorite pair of Mephistos and wasn't really sure what I was going to get back. I had read some reviews and was a little concerned. Much to my surprise when my shoes were returned, I didn't recognize them because they looked like a brand new pair of shoes. Getting my shoes renewed for less than $100 was a great deal. I highly recommend this company for anyone wanting to keep their favorite pair of shoes and save money at the same time.</text>< pics>

"Received my husband's Baduard loafers and they look brand new! The craftsmen did an excellent job. Mephisto shoes, both men and women's, are wonderfully comfortable and of high quality. The added benefit of being able to resole and refurbish our Mephisto shoes directly through Mephisto is a wonderful service. Thank you!" – Linda<//review>

Make sure the shoes you send are:
1) worth rebuilding. Is it cheaper to just buy new?
2) built so that they can be rebuilt.  Many shoes and boots are just glued together and really not designed to re-build .

High quality shoes totally worth the time and the money to rebuild.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Review>I would give them no stars if I could.

I shipped off a pair of Ariats for warranty repair in early May. They were received by NuShoe on 5/8/18. I was told it was a 3-4 week turn around on the repair and getting them back. They were "QC & Package" on 6/8, exactly a month later. I then called on 6/13 to ask why they hadn't shipped since they were packaged on the Friday previous at 12:53 PM and asked about expedited shipping on them since they took longer than expected, and was told that it was not possible, and they were shipping that afternoon. I then kept checking the status to see when they had shipped, and they did not leave the NuShoe facility until Friday 6/15. I am not scheduled to receive them until 6/20.

If I had been paying for this repair, I would be levit with this company and demanding a refund. Not to mention the Ariats were only 3 months old when the soles started to get a hole in them. If these "new" soles last less than a year, they will receive a phone call from me, because I can take my boots to a local shop and have new soles put on in no less than 2 days, and pay $80 and have soles that last for 12-18 months, (I wear my boots almost daily).

I do not recommend this company for any type of repair.<//Review>< Date>

<Text>I've been using Nushoe for over 15 years.  I used to buy only H.S. Trask men's shoes and NuShoe was Trask's "resoler of choice," which is how I got started using NuShoe.  I've had at least 10 pairs of shoes resoled from Trask, Neil M. and Allen Edmonds.  Every time the results have been amazing.  Basically, I pay the $80 and back comes a virtually new pair of favourite shoes.  They do take their time, generally 30 days or so, but you know that going in.  I can't figure out how so many people on here have had such a bad experience.  I'm totally satisfied.<//Text>< Date>

They ruined my shoes, charged me a lot of money, and persist in being rude about it. I'm exhausted. I have dealt with probably a half dozen customer service people over the past few months. I have sent them pictures of what the shoes originally looked like, what the new ones for sale still look like, and the difference between tan and gray, but their best offer is to keep my money and re-return my ruined shoes back to me.

Mephisto needs to find a different authorized refurbishment place. I loved my Mephistos so much! But this experience has been a nightmare.< /review>

Abysmal customer service. Despite 3 attempts to get them to tell me how to get an extra pair of laces, they never responded. When I called them, my estimated wait time kept increasing, from 3 minutes all the way to 15 minutes, over the course of about 15 minutes of holding. My shoes took 5 weeks to return and the job is so-so. The color looks artificial and the laces (!) they supplied were the wrong color (gold going in, black coming out). I didn't give them 1 star because the footbed and sole actually look nice. Avoid if possible.< /review>

I sent two pairs of ECCOs to them one with the polyurethane sole and the other was a rubber sole.  I had taken the time to carefully package the pair of shoes separately, as the polyurethane soles had begun to disintegrate and had a sticky residue.  After following their online instructions, I received a box from them a few weeks later with both pairs of shoes mashed together, and the residue on both pairs of shoes. No email, no phone call, nothing just both pairs of $200(+) shoes crammed into a box that was too small for them, and a note shove deep into one of the shoes (it took two weeks to notice there was a note because it was shoved into the toebox of one of the shoes). Completely unprofessional, and looking into how to hold them responsible for making my shoes worse by getting this residue on the inside and out side of the shoes!<//text><gmapID>0x80d9464af26784b9:0xccafc0ff735fc1b8<//gmapID><Name>PJ Rojas<//Name><Date>1528212855702< /Date>< Resp>

<text>My local cobbler took one look at my shoes' construction and just shook his head, so I decided I had nothing to lose in spite of all these poor reviews. Promised turnaround is 2-4 weeks; mine were delivered to them by UPS on February 23 and left their facility on March 29, the day after I emailed asking about an ETA. Total time away from me: six and a half weeks. Ding! That's one star off.

On the bright side, they came back exactly as I'd hoped. New laces that look better than the originals, and precisely the sole I'd requested (using the Vibram Sole Factor program). I paid $50 for the shoes and $75 for the resole service -- my feet are size 14AA, there are like six shoes on the planet that fit, so to me it was well worthwhile. NuShoe made it work. I'm grateful.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< UserId.>

I sent a pair of AGL Cap-Toe Ballet flats in for refurbishment because the soles were worn. The tops still looked good, but because I wanted them to look their best I opted for the "Ladies Ultra" service. What a huge mistake! The soles are now fine, but the tops came back looking terrible -- strangely dull and monotone! NuShoe's "ultra" service seems to consist of spraying the entire shoe black, including the patent-leather toe, patent silver-metallic strap, and the silver metal rings and buckle. It took me more than an hour (using rubbing alcohol, q-tips, and a microfiber cloth) to carefully remove the black spray from the metal and patent-leather parts. Fortunately, I was largely able to restore the metal and patent-leather parts to their former color and shine. What a disappointment and a waste of $80.</text>

About a year ago, during the pandemic, I sent my husband's black wingtips to Nushoe for new soles and heels and an overall refurbishment of the leather uppers, which were very scuffed and scratched. He has had these shoes for probably 30 years, and they were in bad shape. When the repaired shoes arrived, I was amazed because they looked like a brand new pair. The new soles and heels look quite durable, and the shine on the uppers is blinding.

I highly recommend Nushoes. The cost is a little high, but the improvement to my husband's shoes probably means he will not need to buy another pair of dress shoes for the remainder of his life. Customer service was also very helpful when I called for advice on which option to choose before I placed my order and mailed the shoes. The process for shipment between the customer and Nushoes is very convenient, too.</Text>

Great job on my boots!.  Repair was timely and results were awesome.  I prefer rebuilt boots as opposed to have to break in new ones.  Will definitely use them again when I  wear these new soles out!<//Text>

Did a great job on a pair of Italian leather shoes.  Looked the same as the original set up. Very comfortable and no issues whatsoever.  Thank you!< /Review>

<review>Glad to have found this company, they did a great job on a 20 year old pair of Doc Martens. The sole replacement is excellent, will do business with them again.<//review><GmapID>0x80d9464af26784b9:0xccafc0ff735fc1b8</GmapID><Rating>5<//Rating>< user_id>

<review>I ordered a seafood salad, extra well done bc I am allergic to raw. They brought my food and it was not well done. These people do not understand English. They refuse to remake my food. The cook said he cooked the shrimp for one minute, shrimp is not cooked well done in one minute. If a customer has a problem, fix it! If not, this place just has horrible customer service! and the place smells like raw something. This place needs inspecting and these people need to go back to school!</review><date>1494365651251<//date></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I really enjoy coming to dine at this place😋, the food is great.  I love food 💞, but I am very picky and have high expectations, and I seem to be pleased with every dish I've tried here! The only small problem is the host might seem rude dew to "The language barrier" but as long as the food is great I can bare it, The prices and portions are very fare 👍< /Text><user_name>Anna Gomez</user_name><date>1525753858865</date>< userid>

Best Thai restaurant in the Inland Empire bar none. Nobody does fried rice dishes better than Supanburi! Been going here for more than 15 years. Nice relaxed atmosphere. ☺ Dec. 10, 2017</Text>

Came here with a friend and got some yellow curry (lunch special) and my friend got the green curry (dinner special). I'm a yellow curry kinda gal, but when she let me taste her green curry I was just like 😍 wow. Also, we got there right when they opened at 11am ish so it wasn't busy, but by the time we were leaving, the place was packed! So, another great local spot<//Text>

Great affordable food. This place has been here for a long as I can remember and Thursday food has always been great. I always get the Pad See Eww which is my favorite. When compared to Benjarong this place is equally as good. Make sure to get a stamp card to earn a free meal.</text>

We were staying at Colton and decided to have Thai . This was the only Thai restaurant to our hotel , hence decided to go there . Me and three others were there and we had vegetarian only . The food was pretty good . The service was kind of slow . The place ambience was Decent, nothing to boast off though. We were about to leave and was around 7:50 pm on Saturday , and they just began to play live music in the restaurant . Overall , I enjoyed the place as the food was good .< /Text>

The food in this place was really good until I found someone's nail in one of my dishes I had ordered. Just watch out for that nail or hair, hopefully not something worse and a lot more gross.<//Review>

The food is amazing. Their Pad Thai is the best in the IE. However, they are understaffed so the service takes a while, but the food is worth the wait.<//Review>

Dr. Liz was amazing and has an incredible gift of making you feel totally comfortable and taking the time to explain things thoroughly. I was nervous for the skin check and had to get a couple things removed in the office and Dr. Liz made it an actually enjoyable experience!</Text>

Highly recommend, they make you feel and look like a Star!</Text>< Pictures>

Dr. Dicesare is one of the best in the dermatology business.  Preventative care, expert knowledge ranging from acne to skin cancer, and doesn't try to sell cosmetic side of business.  Covid Safety precautions a "10" out of "10"!  No wait times, staggered appointments.  They put the patient first.<//Text>

< Review>
Liz was great! Knowledgeable, friendly, professional. I had uncomfortable experiences with the front office from the first phone call making my appointment. I couldn’t hear the receptionist....I thought maybe it was a bad connection. When I arrived and called (COVID guidelines) and asked if they were the Medi Spa I saw from the parking lot, the whispering receptionist said “yes, come in”. Misunderstanding...they are not the Medi Spa.

I found suite 150, plastered with COVID-19 warnings and the door locked...🤦🏼‍♀️. Alright...knock knock knock.... the door was opened by the whispering receptionist who abruptly instructed me to use the hand sanitizer...the HAND SANITIZER RIGHT THERE... and sign the COVID papers while I take your temperature. Ok...fine.
“May I use your restroom? “It’s on the second floor” really? Nothing closer? Fine...
I’m getting a bad feeling. I should just leave...this is a weird vibe even by COVID standards.

Thank goodness Liz was lively and spoke clearly.

As I left, another client was approaching the locked door plastered with COVID warnings...”OHMYGOSH! Are you kidding? This is so stupid, so ridiculous!,!” I agreed...and she hadn’t yet been accosted by the greeter...

It’s beyond time to lighten up...</Review>

Tech, Angela, was fun and talkative. After the prelims, Dr. Dicesare came in for the exam within a few minutes. Dr. is pleasant and friendly.

Dr. Athalye is the best dermatologist in the world! She's so compassionate in what she does (i.e. she actually cares). I highly recommend seeing her if you're looking for a doctor who is down to Earth and exceptionally competent!</Review>

Un professional billing and management. Just trying to bill your insurance company.

After reaching out to their office as requested. The office mgr. stated that whether or not their Dr. told me  I was not being charged for a service because it was  never rendered, that I would be billed. She went on to state we bill anyone who walks in our doors and sits in a room.
They then hand off the billing to a third party company that will send past due bills etc... to get payment.< /Text>

I haven't come across anything like the bad reviews are talking about. My appointments have been timely and the doctor has good bedside manner (I hate shots, I hate knives more). I've got a lot of freckles and Dicesare checks them all, takes pictures and marks size to watch for change. I ask questions and he explains clearly enough for me to understand. My tests were communicated back to me in the standard 5-10 days.<//Review>

<Text>I went into the office because I had something growing on my arm that came out of nowhere.  Went in a had a biopsy done.  Got the results and it said it could be a AFX or Sarcoma.  Sarcoma is a really bad thing and should be taken out asap.  They said there first date available was 2 1/2 months away but not to worry about the cancer.

I asked them for a cash price and they said they would get back to me.  I ended up calling 4 times and they said the nurse would call me back with a price.  They never called back and each time I called back I told them my frustration which seemed to not make a difference.

My Sarcoma started growing and started bleeding like crazy after the first month.  I went back into them to show it and they said it was not a big deal.  I did some research online and discovered it actually was a big deal.  I called them to get the biopsy results sent to me and they told me numerous times that they were going to.  Then on the 4th time of calling for the results they said they could not email them to me because of the laws.  How about telling that to me the first time?

I finally ended up a second and third opinion from other doctors.  Both of them ended up saying that it needed to come out asap.  That it should of never gone this long because of the Pathiology results showing possible Sarcoma.  I had it cut out with the MOHS procedure and sure enough turned out to be a Sarcoma.  Now I am having to go see an Oncologist to make sure the cancer did not spread through the rest of my body.

These people do not care about your health.  You are just a number and they did not care that they were more worried about their booked schedule of Botox then taking care of someone's life.  The tumor ended up trippling in size in 2 1/2 months and the Doctor said it could of started as an AFX and then morphed into a Sarcoma because of the delayed time.

< Review>
I saw Dr. DiCesare for the removal of a cyst on my right wrist.  He removed the cyst and gave me three stitches and did a biopsy. He told me his office would be in touch regarding the biopsy results and that I should return in two weeks to remove the stitches.  Over that period of time, the area was inflamed and continued to look red.  No word was received on the results of the biopsy.  My attempts to call the office proved futile because the phone number I had was incorrect.  When I got to the office to remove the stitches, the nurse babbled something about not being able to give me the biopsy results because they were "inconclusive."  With Dr. DiCesare away on vacation, no one was able to interpret the results.  One thing was sure, they did not show a definite negative reading.

At the office, I was told that Dr. DiCesare was not going to see me.  The assistant removed the stitches from my still inflamed wrist, placed some kind of steri bandage and provided no further instructions.

I am lucky that my brother is a doctor, and I will send this biopsy report to him to review.

I will under no circumstance recommend this office.  Any doctor who does not have the time to see a patient for follow-up is not worthy of the name.</Review>

<review>I'm so happy I went here! Last minute color correction and they took me in. Mind you I had black box color on my roots and box dark burgundy on the bottom. I was a MESS! They are friendly, helpful and know what they are doing. They also do eyebrows and mine came out great. My hair stylist was Anna. She has hands of an angel. Cant wait for my touch up in 2 months!

<review>I'm upset with the service. I had dark brown virgin hair and requested an ombre/balayage. I paid almost $400 and did not get what I wanted. I showed the hairdresser the picture and not sure where it went wrong, but it was nothing like what I requested. I wanted darker caramel highlights and got ash blonde highlights with no ombre whatsoever. Ended up dyeing it back to my original color and wasted $400.< /review>< pictures>

<Gmap_id>0x80c2cda05229bca7:0xf8c1c4e97660f6c8<//Gmap_id><Text>I would rate this salon a 5 stars but recently they lost one of their best hairstylist. I had been going to Diana J for years even before they moved to the new location. I had an appointment scheduled with her before Covid19 and through out the lockdown they kept texting me trying to reschedule me with another stylist, I called to see if I would be able to get her info but again they insisted I booked with someone else.
It's upsetting they didn't want to provide me any info and they insisted to keep my business.

Luckily I found her on Instagram.

<username>Zujey Alvarado< /username><Date>1566949436743</Date><text>My 17 year old daughter Did not get the hair color she requested.
We asked for light blonde Balayage via ig dm and in salón (with a picture)
We left salon with ash (very ash hair) with ugly silver streaks. The roots looked like a touch up was needed. If you picked up her hair in a poiny tail it looked grown out ombre.
We immediately complained and the "colorist" upset at us challenged us and said we asked for that ash (never happened). I said we definitely did not ever say ash blonde and we would like to fix it. She toned it (with a bad attitude) the hair was still the same after that. We were tired so we paid and said we'd call back to discuss a solution. I called a couple of days later hoping the color would change and again with attitude she claimed she gave us what we asked for(not so) we went back and forth and finally she said wait a few weeks for color to come in and if you're not satisfied they would tone it again. But they would not do anything else to fix it. The color changed a little but the ash and silver was still there. The roots looked ugly. We decided not to bother going back because they are not looking to help us. They don't care because they do get good business. One customer lost is nothing to them. We found a wonderful colorist in cypress who fixed the problem Evolution Salón did not. Unfortunately we did spend more money but we are happy with the results. My poor daughter waisted her hard earned money and at in a chair with out a restroom break for 14 hours. INCONSIDERATE!!

14 hours in the chair.
Over priced.

I'll like to say I have been coming here for years now and they never disappoint! You do got to keep in mind work takes time and is a process. I have gone from black to brown to blonde and back! I can't never have my hair the same color for long periods of time! Also as a loyal customer you can't expect to bleach your hair and not take care of it! So most of the time I buy the products that they recommend! Pricing it's good and reasonable they go by the length of your hair and the products that they use.
You get what you pay for.<//text>

<Text>I have been coming to this salon for the last 4 years and it's been the longest I'd ever stay for that long. The place is clean and the atmosphere is enjoyable ( girl talk). I first came to this place with bleached broken hair and Ana helped me getting it back to healthy, cutting my hair every 2-3 months and my hair was right above my shoulders. Now my hair is healthy (still blonde) and long (to the WAIST!!), getting cut twice a year 😄. Not long ago I had my hair dark brown and she dyed my hair blonde in ombré style.....IN LOVE with my hair and healthy. This was an 8 hour process with cut and blow dry. FYI I have tons of hair and long. I paid $300 something. But totally worth it.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

Although it is hard to find parking, the prices and taste of the food can't be beat! The staff are very friendly and even allowed us to taste a few different spicy salsas. Highly recommend visiting for some authentic Mexican food!</text>

Just had an amazing dinner at El cerrito!! We were helped by a very nice man named Francisco, I feel he went above and beyond to make sure everything was Perfect!  If he wasnT the owner he should be because we could deffinitly tell how passionate he is about working there!!  It was very nice to sit down and Have INDOOR AND OUTDOOR Dinning. Thank you EL Cerrito,  the food and service was amazing.</Text>

Super Burrito was more rice and salad in side than anything else...San Jose's taquerias have been generally going down the drain in the last 10yrs. So sad, i go to taco bell or fast food more now because i dont wanna be upset by a 11 dollar burrito full of rice.< /Text>

Food was delicious, a bit pricey but none the less delicious!! For a mexican restaurant I expected there salsa to be a little bit hotter, it wasn't hot at all. I tried the green and the red. But other than that it was great.</review>

I ordered chicken burrito but lady heard steak. I thought "the universe speaks, STEAK TIME!" 😆 -reason minus star

I appreciate the freshness of the food vs. The time of night 🌙 I ordered... midnight.
Verdict = bomb 💣burrito 🌯 24/7< /review>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>I like to rate places based on initial to final aspect of the experience.
Carolinas isnt my favorite, had been sometime. I ordered by way of drive through. Wait wasnt horrible but it wasnt good.
Service was standard. Didnt save on the cost. Which goes with my reason for overall rating of one star. The food was cold and very unsatisfying in every way, basically disgusting. I ordered a Super Burrito that what super sloppy & soggy, like a prank with as much sour cream it had was oozing out from every where. With salt being the main ingredient and limited sips from my large cup ice with light soda I wont be wasting my money there again.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

I’ve never left a review in my life. But I had to for this reason... the shrimp I received smelled like it has been left out for a few weeks. The meat I received was very crispy. All of my food was soggy, and smelled really bad. I was instantly sick (15 mins) after eating a small corner of my food (I couldn’t eat it all because it smelled bad). Every single plate I got was cold. The shrimp left a bad smell in my car and I’m sure none of the food was fresh. The drinks were really good though.< /Text>

I ordered sour cream on the side because my spouse likes it and I hate it and you put a huge amount on my food. I definitely don't want any of your sour cream burrito. Thanks. I'm taking my business to taco bell. Least they can make a burrito right. The last time you all forgot to put salt in your beans. I spent 30 dollars for bland food and then go back and get attitude over sour cream. You guys probably put it on purpous out of spite.< /Text>

I ordered a torta and enchilada combo and once I went home I realized it was the wrong combo. I came back and told her what was wrong with the order. She first said I didn’t charge you for that, but she NEVER gave me a receipt so how would we know?  Then she replied “you ate it haha” I then told her no I did not. She called the chef over and they spoke in Spanish and said that I just wanted a free meal.  While we waited for the food to be corrected the cashier then spoke in Spanish and said “she’s just trying to get a free meal” “she ate it” . Very argumentative cashier and cook. Also when they corrected my meal the cook they did not put any of the meat in my meal just beans rice and cheese !  They had 5 people inside the kitchen “hanging out” she slammed the window in my face multiple times when I would ask a question. The food didn’t even taste good. Very upset waste of time and money .</Review><user_name>Kassey Glenn</user_name>< Rating>

The food is your basic Mexican "fast" food. The only down side is they take a while to get you your food even before COVID-19 shutdowns. The staff are always nice a much more to choose from after they changed to Davilas.<//review>

<text>I went here to buy two churros and a large horchata. My total came to $5.82 but then I look at my card statement and it says pending charge of $6.98. I didn’t know they charge a $1.16 for swipe Visa card. Yeah that’s weird I think she may just put herself a tip without saying anything.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Food is good and tastes good. When it opens great place to relax and eat. But the challenge is this for all veterans you can use your Stars card. I know shocking but they really do and it is the only one that you can use your Stars card outside the military base. But please I challenge you to check it out for yourself. It was Carolinas now it is Davilas< /text>

Food made fresh and kitchen area looks clean. Wish they didnt charge extra for things similar places hand out for free like extra salsas or carrots.</text>

We came here around 2 in the morning. I had my usual taco craving. 3 asada tacos and it was pretty good. With these kinds of restaurants I usually expect myself to get sick because you know its 24 hrs. BUT it was really good meat was super hard to chew lol but I didnt get sick or anything delicious! Lots of meat and chips weren't stale so it was worth the 9 bucks after all.</review>

<Text>Great place to eat! For the money, it's worth it! This place has changed, I don't know if the staff has changed since the new name. I just came from this place 7/29/2020 around 8:50PM lady claims I didn't say I didn't want ice in my drinks. Get to the window and she confirmed the order and I say, yeah no ice. She then say it's already made and she can refund my money, but refused to make my drinks over. How hard is it to make a drink with no ice and to hear what someone said the first time? Won't be going back here, used to like this place, but the girl that works the window around this time at night sucks.<//Text><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x809ac594b26234cd:0xca360db9afc1119f< /gmapID>< Pictures>

Ordered two things, the cashier heard my order wrong and informed me that the manager would not remake my order for me....like at all!! So they did refund me, but when I asked to speak to the manager he refused to even speak to me. What kind of service place is that!?!? Will be calling in to talk to the owner for sure.</text>

<text>went there for my uber rider, who was a super sweetheart btw, we got to the drive through speaker  Where you place your order and we waited about 7 minutes until we got a gentleman on the speaker who told us that there was no burritos or tacos only nachos and French fries he asked us to come to the window so we did and he repeated again that there was nothing on the menu except for nachez and French fry whatever My passenger ended up ordering for her and her boo but they didn't even get what they wanted kind of weird to go to a Mexican restaurant and they don't have tacos or burritos turns out the guy was there by himself but still weird that there was no Mexican food.<//text>< pictures>

This is honestly drunk people's food. You can tell the food was cooked overnight or if it's been out all day. Not horrible but not good either. Always went after a long night of drinking and need something to eat.</text>

This is a fast food restaurant, so my critique is keeping that in mind.  In that light it gets 5 stars!  Really delicious food with a 24 hr drive thru!  My favorites are the chili relleno burrito, and the chorizo breakfast burrito.  They make a good fish taco too.</Text>

Great place to get a big azz burrito late night after a movie, clubbing, 420ing munchies, pregnancy hunger go here they'll take care of your food junkie needs. I was pleasantly surprised of the quantity as well as quality of their food it was my first time I've been there 10+ times since. God get your grub on at Carolina's Mexican.<//Text>

Do not come here I repeat do not come here I arrived here at 3 a.m. in the morning to get some hot food. cook wasn't wearing any gloves when handling my food. He used his bare hands to flip my tacos. I paid 7.98 for 3 mini tacos. the meat sat in a plastic container for who knows how long. The meat was cold. when I arrived home there was a hair found in my food.  Not cool</Review>

I paid 7.98 for 3 mini tacos the cook did not use gloves when handling my foo.  don't expect hot food when you arrive at 3 a.m. in the morning basically they have your meat sitting in the plastic container and they just dump it on your tortillas and serve it to you. So im paying money for old food. Wont be back.

When i arrived home i found a piece of hair in my food.  Underneath my taco.  I was watching these guys make my food the whole time definitely not sanitary  now i have to wait till the morning to actually cook something.</Review>

I really love Carolinas the food is good it's nice to have a Mexican food place in this area were you can go in and eat or go through the drive-thru I love the variety menu. The Cook's and employees are awesome very sweet people. I go there often the only thing I think they need to improve is the salsa they give you in the Drive-Thru it's embarrassing to think that they consider that salsa water with flavor that's what I would call it.<//text>

Good food & luv their Hochata drink...I don't usually go 2 a "drive thru or fast stop 4 Mexican food or any kind 4 that matter expect of course Hamburgers & Hotdogs that can be cooked fast that doesn't require much. But, Carolina's are pretty good. I was leery of trying them out at first. My son recommended them,he knows all the restaurants that are open late or 24/7 from working late hours. Customer Service is alright. Food is GREAT. They ONLY got my order wrong once or twice. No biggie. They always have business.<//text>

< Review>
I have been to a few locations and i dont know what it is about this one but i cant within reason return. There are no lights in the parking lot. I almost ran into a parking lot structure trying to find the drive thru. No lights on menu sign...no lights on building. I dont know if they are saving money...if there was a power outage just in their parking lot or what but its absolutely 100% dangerous for the people that work there and customers. Second...again...maybe isolated but i dont know how i got ground beef with ZERO salt but i had the most disgusting tacos ever and as much as i eat and love mexican food...thats kind of hard to accomplish. How are you a chain/franchise whatever and mess up taco meat? It was truly gross. Stuff here is mot cheap...especially when you buy alacarte so i def wont return to this location. Very disappointing.<//Review>

I really like this place cuz it's just down the street it's 24 hours usually around 3 a.m. day are closed or at least part of the restaurants close so you can only order slick items on the menu it's not the cleanest place but if you are drunk on a Friday night supper place to go to get some greasy food< /review>

Never been inside but the drive-thru is very slow. I get that they make it right there on the spot but they wait for a line to build up before they start to pick it up. Only reason i'm giving 3 stars is because the food I get is good<//Text>

<review>Trashy. Roaches crawling on walls. Poor customer service. The employees are hard of listening & refuse to fix your order after they're responsible for messing it up. one of the worst customer service I've experienced. Unless it's 3 am, you're drunk & it's the only thing open.....nah just go to Denny's.<//review><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x809ac594b26234cd:0xca360db9afc1119f< /gmapID></record>

<review>Loved their carne asada nachos. To me it didn't seem as big as the ones I have gotten from Adelbertacos but there was so much more flavor that it totally made up for it!
Their burritos were also delicious, and HUGE too! Wonderful food and big portions.</review>< Pics>

< Review>
Today was a sad morning. My family has always chosen to eat Carolinas despite the cost, the quality has always been great so I've never minded paying more. Well today was just unfortunate. I ordered the #3 & the #18 chile relleno and at first I thought where's the sauce but decided oh well some sauce is better than none. T hen I took a bite (I really wish I hadn't ) not only was it watery but there was no cheese at all and the chile itself tasted old (I'd swear they served me grass clippings) i couldn't get past the first bite so I settled for beans and rice I paid $25 for 2 plates that barely had any food and was completely disappointing. Nothing like throwing away $25 first thing in the morning.<//Review>

<review>Ok how do I began this is a quantity over quality Mexican restaurant. I see many reviews of how good the food is. Honestly this is a club food stop. People from Mangos or some late nite club come here because it open 24 hrs . This place could put more emphasis on there ingredients in example. The guacamole is water down and flavorless. The meat is extremely questionable. In the back of there store they dump the grease . This place needs a better emphasis on there food . The crowds will continue to come to this place I deem a dump. Ifs it 2 in the morning and you just left the club . Carolina Mexican restaurant is the place for you.< /review>< Pictures>

The food was .normal nothing you couldn't get at el pollo loco, we had to ring the bell to get service.
The best I could point out was the salsas, they were good with the tortilla chips< /text>

They're pretty good it's always a wait though so you're always going to be waiting at least 10 minutes if not longer if you go through the drive-in or should I say drive thru but they have really good food</review>
