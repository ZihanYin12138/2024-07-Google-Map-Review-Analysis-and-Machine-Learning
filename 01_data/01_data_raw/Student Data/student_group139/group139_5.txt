<Review>Absolutely fantastic experience at this location.  The whole staff was amazing and better yet two Steeler fans and one Cowboys fan what a loving rivalry. They were helpful,  informative and super friendly.  They went the extra mile to find the exact car charger I was looking for they were all AMAZING!!!!!
I'll definitely visit this location again.</Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1621787002089, 'text': 'Hi Ms. Lewis.\nWe do our best to equip our team to assist our customers.\nWe hope to connect with you soon.'}<//Resp>< GmapID>

Shout out to Liz. We came in on Tuesday to upgrade our phones, she was very helpful. We ordered phones with her, they arrived just 2 days later. We went back in and we where happy Liz  was available to help us. She activated our phones & completed the exchange with no problems. She has an amazing attitude, 5 star service😊🙌🏻<//Review>

<Text>Today I went into the store to get information in adding a line and upgrading my own phone. Adrian was the associate who assisted me. Not only was he friendly, but very professional and knowledgeable of the products and plans that best fit my needs. He definitely went above and beyond with his service. He is a example of what a store associate should be and act. He definitely has management potential or even beyond that! Wonderful employee!!

<Text>I visited this place yesterday to get an upgrade for my daughter and I have to say I received the best customer service ever. We were helped by Liz, Cece and another young lady who was in training. They honestly were the best. Cece the manager, went above and beyond to help us and I greatly appreciate everything she did for us. I give this location a 5 star and if there was more stars to give, I’d totally give it more as they were awesome!!!!!! Thank you ladies for the awesome help.<//Text><rate>5< /rate></record></dataset><record>

I went in for an inquiry and did not find the information useful so chose to wait before making any changes. I let the Store manager (Eduardo) know I did not want to make any changes and I will think about it. Next thing you know my plan changed and and I received an email regarding those changes. The changes made were not even discussed. I lost my grandfathered unlimited plus plan and grandfathered hotapot plan for my nighthawk. I went back to the store and the manager said I have to call to get it fixed. I called and spoke with another rep (Juan) and was put on hold for 1 hour! I am very upset and I need help ASAP!</Review>

The other day I went to At&t store with my grandfather.I was amazed by the performance they had.As soon as I walked in my grandfather and I were greeted by a young man named Erick.I didn’t think of it much just a simple greeting,but then he approached us and asked if we needed anything at all and not only did he say this to us in English,but he said in Spanish and my grandfather only speaks Spanish so this really helped him a lot.He not only helped us get a good phone for my grandfather he helped my grandfather understand everything there is to know about the phone.Which is absolutely insane to me the knowledge this young man had to not only know the device,but to show him how to use it and let me tell you what.My grandfather has been so amazed by the whole animoji experience and i’m super glad that because of Erick I won’t have to explain how to flip the camera during a face time.</Text>

My wife and I went in for 4 lines and were helped by Lucas J, who is by far the most awesome sales rep we've ever dealt with! He was friendly, honest, and communicated everything in a way that we could understand! I highly recommend this store we left very satisfied and Lucas told us to call with any questions which you often hear but is  a broken promise but I've had to call a few times and Lucas was available and helped me out each time!!<//Text>

Eduardo, the store manager goes above & beyond his job to assist you. My mother and I walked in upset with an issue that another AT&T store created for us. We walked in fuming and walked out with 7 new upgrades. Totally recommend him.</review>

I look forward to doing business again

Edit: just went back there to buy the apple watch series 5 and the purchase went smoothly I didn't expect to get good service twice 🙌🏼♥️</review>

Have been to a few Sherwin Williams store and find them all very good. My neighborhood store is Morena Blvd. and it is my favorite. The sales representatives go out of their way to make sure I get the colors I need.  They a friendly and informative.  While the prices are higher, the quality is excellent.  I could really tell the difference in the ease of spreading and coverage with the Sherwin Williams paint.< /text>

<review>Last week we walked in requesting the paint for coral bay apartment. We received from sherwin  the gloss version of the paint color . But we realized later that we needed the matte color. We came in today and the gentlemen unfortunately I did not catch his name. . But he corrected the situation and helped us out within 5 min we were out the door. Thank you so much you made an awkward situation seem effortless to correct. Happy holidays< /review>< response>

I went there on Tuesday to get my car wash done. I was greeted by maybe the owner and he helped me out also offered my to power wash the rain stains for $150. Anyways, I sat for about an hour and when I was done I paid Cash. Today, Thursday I checked my bank statement and it said Ontario Auto Spa charged $20 on your card. WHAT???? first of all how did they charge $20 on my card when I paid cash??? They are thieves. The only way is that they either found the card in the car and used it or they are special kind of people who steal identity. I called the bank she said they didn’t use a pin and used it as credit. DO NOT GO HERE UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR IDENTITY STOLEN.< /Text>

The nice gentleman came up to my car and was very pleasant and asked me what I wanted to get done on my car today and what were my major concerns were. He offered me the best deal and I ended up getting the inside and outside detailed for less than $100 and they did an amazing job. All of the other employees were really nice as well and made sure that I was taken care of. My windows were spotless with no bugs, bird poo, or sap. The outside just shined. The inside was vacuumed and they did move the seats (I have a van) to clean under and around them, they wiped down all the interior. I could not believe it was my car. IT WAS SO CLEAN LIKE NEW!

My vehicle left, looking amazing. I considered the price to be fair. Different wash options.  So you get what you pay for.  Staff is very hard working.</Review>

My 1st time here at Archibald Carwash and what a super great place!!! I was first greeted by a young man name Edwin who was extremely kind, which at most carwash places you only get a ticket with the type of carwash you’re going to get. But at Archibald Carwash Edwin immediately introduced himself and ask my name in return, then he proceeded to explain the types of Carwashes after I picked the Carwash I wanted he then gave me a discount which was so nice! After receiving my Carwash ticket I went in to pay where I next met a beautiful young lady by the name of Kimberly who was so sweet after paying I walked outside where the mgr. Oscar came out & introduced himself. What a really really great place to go if you want your vehicle washed & taken care of, most Carwash places just want your money & then don’t even do a good job, but I am more then extremely satisfied & very very happy with how awesome & amazing my car came out!! Thank you Archibald Carwash & thank you Edwin, Kimberly & Oscar for taking the time to be so kind and making me feel like a longtime customer which without a doubt I will be bcuz of how well I was treated & how extremely amazing my car came out!!< /Review>

Got the top of the line wash package, but quality of work was subpar.  Not worth the prices they charge.  Wash elsewhere if you have a choice.<//review>

<Review>NOT brushless. It functions as a normal gas station car wash (express),  but has a full service option. I used the Express option.  There was someone at the end that still hand dried the car,  so that was a plus.<//Review><Date>1557882445500< /Date><user>118173950037563584062<//user>< name>

< Review>
This review is for Sou out of Fresno California.5 star experience! We were happy that RepairSmith was in our area since we had several cars in our family that needed oil changes all at the same time. It was super simple to schedule and beyond convenient. Our technician Sou was outstanding, on time, professional and fast. Because of him and convenience we will definitely use their services again. Thank you again!</Review>

Anthony was not only on time but early. Was very professional and thorough.  He explained everything and all costs involved. He was right on the spot as far as the timeline of the repair.  And now the issue of the oil pressure sensor has been resolved with the replacement. Would definitely use again and will definitely refer others.< /Text>

I was charged $95.00 for the tech to tell me what I already knew about the check engine code.   It’s been 5 days since the tech looked at my vehicle and no response or quote to make repairs.  Just spent 15 minutes on hold and no one returned to the phone.  I just have up a service fee of $95.00 with no results.   Go to a shop as this has happened with several other mobile services</text>

I chose this company, because the ease of someone coming to you when your car won't start seemed like a no brainer. I was very impressed that I could get next day service in Portland, OR.

First appointment: I scheduled the appointment for Sunday afternoon (2:30 PM - 4:30) and spent two hours waiting. After two hours went by, I called to check the status and learned the technician cancelled the appointment. The company simply deflected by saying that there was an attempt to e-mail me and that I must not have received it, which was not true. The soonest availability was Tuesday Morning. I e-mailed the company to notify them of my disappointment on the initial interaction and did not receive a response.
Second appointment: The technician was confident that all I needed was a new battery, but then determined that this was not the case and that I would need a new starter and mentioned that they had a 1 PM available the next day (Wednesday) and that they would get that time reserved for me.
Third appointment: One hour went by on Wednesday and they told me they put in a contingency time for 4:00 PM - 6:00 PM in case the technician is delayed.
Fourth appointment: The technician couldn't make this later time happen. I was rescheduled for the following morning (Thursday) from 8:30 AM - 10:30 AM.
Fifth appointment: The company notified me by 8:10 AM that the technician was not going to make it and wanted to reschedule for the following morning (Friday).
Sixth appointment: By 8:30 AM, my appointment has already been pushed back to 10:30 AM to 12:30 PM. I made a note that this appointment has already been rescheduled numerous times and was offered $25 off.

Pros (this was not an entirely negative experience, which is why I am giving one star): online scheduling, text reminders, transparent pricing--I appreciate the fact that the price of the initial diagnostic will be reduced from my final repair price, in addition to the discount for so many reschedules. The technician was professional, kind, and understood my needs. I really enjoyed the interaction that I had with them and have been looking forward to having them work on my car again this week.

If I could do things over again, I would have just called my insurance company and had my car towed to the nearest shop. I would have preferred for my car to sit for a week in a shop instead of continuing to be disappointed on a daily basis thinking that my car was going to be looked at. I have been trying to get this vehicle fixed up so I can sell it and purchase a more family friendly vehicle and my experience with RepairSmith significantly reduced the expediency in which I was hoping to do that. What seems like convenience (online scheduling, text reminders, credit cards on file for contactless payment) made me think that it would be taken care of in a timely manner and was ultimately a big distraction for how disappointing the entire process was. I will never use this company again.<//text>

Found them online just trying to check things out. Before I knew it, I had made an appointment.
Rod was great, very professional. Made sure to give the right suggestion and went straight to work. Great service, great price. The best part is that everything happened at my house!<//text>

He was very professional, and the quality of his work was superb. I am very fortunate to have discovered RepairSmith. It is a great company. I highly recommend it.< /Review>

My Porsche oil change costs $120 minus discount (about half or third of indie Porsche mechanic in town).

Looking at the reviews I am a little confused because my experience has been less then. I had to make three appointments all of them unsuccessful.
The first appointment I made I received a text the next day saying they could not come out because they were booked. Although their system allows customers to continue to schedule appointments even though they don’t have openings. What is that about?

Weeks later I schedule another appointment, again the appointment was confirmed, and like before I received a text message this time at the end of the day, stating they could not make that appointment because there was a double booking and the slot time was given to someone else.
That same person rescheduled me for two days later.. we agreed and it was confirmed again. When the appointment time came around no one had shown up no one had given  me a call. I text the mechanic to see what was going on no response. I ended up calling customer service and what I got from them was a BS of an excuse and apology. The representative Jeff I believe, told me that the mechanic text me and said he was running late, he doesn’t know why I did not receive the text and maybe there’s a glitch in their computer system. Then I asked him for an estimated time as to when the mechanic will arrive.. 2 hours after the original time.

The fact is there was no communication from the mechanic. I had to text and call to get an understanding as to why no one had shown up and I did not get a good explanation. Unacceptable! This was a complete waste of my time I had other obligations, I had to clear my schedule three times because of this. No regards for the customers time and money.</review>

Complete rip-off I was charged 95 dollars for the diagnostic. I told them what was wrong with the car and at the end they didn’t want to fix my car. Save yourself some time and money and go into a real shop.</Text>

I\'ve asked the Tech is you were told we could/would not do the work and he said that was not communicated, in fact we provided you with a quote to do the work.

I too wanted to make sure that we did not give you bad info so I called the Honda dealer nearest me (Weir Canyon Honda).  I spoke with Service and asked them about the six mounts Chris recommended. They consisted of the following:  Engine Torque Rod Lower, Engine Torque Rod Upper, Front Engine Mount, Passenger Side Engine Mount, Rear Engine Mount, and Transmission Mount.  Since I too am not a mechanic, I asked if the Transmission Mount was considered an engine mount, making it a total of six on your vehicle and he told me "yes".  This is why Chris suggested we replace all six.  As a mobile service we come ready to do them all, if the Tech gets on site and discovers you don\'t need all six replaced, we (like the Boy Scouts) are prepared, not only with the part and appropriate time on the schedule, but you know the worst case scenario price was as well.  I believe Chris had the best of intentions, perhaps he could have explained it more thoroughly, and I will have a conversation with him to make sure in the future we lay it out more clearly.  However; your vehicle does indeed have six separate engine mounts as you see listed above, we depend on return business so I took this very seriously when you complained and looked into it myself, I have a zero tolerance for lying or suggesting that our customers need something they do not.  -Debbie Sr. Manager of Customer Operations.'}</Resp>< Time>

< Review>
I am very disappointed in this company. I have used repair Smith in the past and been very pleased with the mechanic and the service. I went to the dealership and found out that I had a right collapsed engine mount. at the time I thought okay it's a little expensive at the dealership and I would wait. In the meantime I also needed my valve gasket replaced so I called repair Smith set an appointment and had them come replace it at the same time he was here I had him check that engine mount he verified that the engine mount that's near the oil pan on my car had failed and I needed a new one . The cost for one engine mount on my car was $149 per repair Smith great price. I called the schedule service of the engine mount and also wanted to see how much it would cost to get all four of them replaced if a need be why they were doing them $597 total for all four of them to be replaced great deal so I scheduled the service. About an hour or so after hanging up the phone I received a call from Chris the supervisor repair Smith he gave me a call to let me know that my car which is a 2008 Honda Civic LX coupe has 6 engine mounts, he explained that he's very familiar with the problem that I was having because my car was vibrating a lot at idle and also was a little wobbly at times. He told me he would do the best to get me a great deal on all six but he feels that I should do all six at once that they don't feel comfortable doing one engine mount replacement when the others could be bad as well. I told him that's a little too much money for me and I only thought my car had four mounts he said no two of them are hidden they are not seen with the visible eye so being as though he is a supervisor and repair Smith and a mechanic I believe him plus I like the company I trust them, so he proceeds to give me a quote of $1,250 total we schedule the service because it's dangerous for me to drive like that and this is my only vehicle for me my daughter and my husband me and my husband are both essential workers we need our car and God forbid I don't want to hurt anybody out there or ourselves driving on bad mounts. I went to bed that night feeling kind of weird about the situation I felt that was too much and why would I leave be told that there are 4 mounts when theres 6? I called 3 dealerships for Honda and asked  the service managers how many mounts are on my car both of them said only 4, and there's never been a Honda built with 6 mounts,  I was astonished, disappointed and felt hurt that I was betrayed or lied to how much more money is Repairsmith going to make off those 2 extra mounts that they added on to my car that don't even exist? With that being said now I have to find another mechanic that will work on my car in a short period of time because I need it done but that's just honesty and it's wrong so I had to put this review.Now update I have had my car serviced by a licensed mechanic of 35 years and he verified with me that I only have 4 mounts. Engine tork rods as you call them are not TECHNICALLY MOUNTS! depends on the mechanic. Just for future reference like I said before I talked to 3 mechanics at dealerships they all said 4 . Unless you count rods. But the car was only made with 4 mounts on my vehicle. I only needed 2 the right front mount and the transmission mount. Cost $ 778.97.<//Review>

I would recommend RepairSmith to anyone. It was super easy and convenient. I have a ‘13 Honda Accord and I needed an oil change. They came and fixed the car right up. Will use them moving forward for any car service.< /Review>

I received a quote from my mechanic in Santa Monica to get my spark plugs replaced which I thought was too high. Repair smith not only beat it but came to my house! The whole process was seamless!<//review>

< review>
My car was smoking because of over oiled (badly). So I contact possible repair place on Yelp and RepairS with response asap and asked to come check my car out The Next Day! Memorial Day! (some repair shop was closed). The gave me quote for the overall check.
And Byan was the guy who came to fix my car. He drove here on time, contact me with phone calls and text where he was and when exactly he will arrive (to not making you worry that he is not coming). He is humble, and friendly. He loved his job, definitely know what he is doing and just want to help. He gave me the details of what is wrong with my car, whatever else I have question about he would check and give my advise. Tell me what they can and can't do (Not over charge for nothing).
He gave me told me the prices and explain thoroughly why. Then he scheduled to come back ON SUNDAY, 8AM! (like as if they will be there anytime you need) and TAADAA~, car back to 100%.
There is 12 month guaranty, if my car still have problem, he will come back for it!
I wouldn't say the service is fast or anything because the car need times to get take care of, but he was on time and everything just get done with no concern.

Big Thanks to Byan and RepairS with!<//review>

< Review>
RepairSmith saves the day! I experienced a total loss of power steering on my Audi just a few hundred yards from my home - the car was no longer driveable. RepairSmith came by to my house the next day to diagnose the problem and identified a hole in the power steering hose and all of the hydraulic fluid had drained. Given the severity of the issue, the RepairSmith technician said that they needed to take my car offsite to fix the issue. They arranged a full concierge service for me, including having my car towed on a flatbed truck, taken offsite to get repaired, and returned to me good as new. It was a completely seamless experience end-to-end. The technicians were extremely knowledgeable and kind, there was constant communication and updates along the way, and the prices were way better than I could get anywhere else, not to mention it was extremely convenient top-to-bottom. I'm fully sold on RepairSmith and will be using it for all of my car maintenance and repair needs moving forward. Thanks for saving the day RepairSmith!!!< /Review>

<text>I am a new RepairSmith customer. A customer rep named "Kim" scheduled my appointment. She was professional yet made me feel at ease because I had reservations about this new type of Auto service. On the day of service, a mechanic named "Joey" called to notify me he was on his way. He arrived on schedule and serviced my car in a timely manner. Additionally, he found that one of my tires had a screw embedded in it, which required immediate attention to prevent a flat. I loved the convenience of getting my car serviced at my residence because I was able to complete my household chores during the time Joey worked on my van. I imagine this service would be ideal for mothers with young children and well as the elderly or infirm because of the convenience of not having to leave home. I loved the service I received from RepairSmith because I did not have to leave home, my repairs were completed in a timely manner, there was no mess in my driveway, Kim and Joey were both professional in manner and performance, and best of all: the cost was the same, if not better, than going to a auto repair shop. I highly recommend RepairSmith to everyone.<//text><UserId.>103896147584526140633< /UserId.>< Gmap_id>

I was searching for West LA brake repairs and had a hard time getting real quotes that seemed accurate & fair. I reached out to RepairSmith, and they responded super fast. They got me an appointment the next day, and it was soo convenient and easy since they came to me at the office! It was great since there wasn't any waiting around or having to drop off my car somewhere.<//Review>

Got a check engine light, and didn't have time to take my car to the dealer on the other side of Los Angeles.  Gave RepairSmith a call, and they sent a mechanic to my office in Venice to diagnose the problem.  It turned out that my oxygen sensor was broken.  They asked if they could take the car to their shop to fix it, and they returned it completely fixed before it was time to go home.

Thanks!  Super convenient, and I didn't even need to Uber around West LA to get my car repaired.</text>

I used them last Friday to have a broken brake light fixed. They replaced the full right rear brake light with a brand new one while I was at the office. In addition they topped off my fluids and replaced 4 light bulbs (two up front and two in the trunk/license plate area). Incredibly easy and transparent process. Very easy and friendly to communicate with. Would highly recommend if you are busy and hate dropping your car off at the dealership or a repair shop.< /Text>

<Text>The brakes on my Infiniti QX30 were squeaking and with work I didn't have time to take it in, so decided to go with RepairSmith (a friend recommendation). I was able to quickly schedule a time and they came to my office in Torrance. I just handed them the keys and went back to work. I got a text when it was done and came down. Highly recommend this new way of servicing your car!!

<text>After almost 2 hours waiting for their quote I confirmed my appointment (as well as my phone number and email).  I received a message saying, “thank you for confirming your appointment.”

Under “what happens next“ they said their mechanic would meet me at my house at the agreed-upon time.  The time came and went.  After an hour I called and was told that I inquired about a repair but did not make appointment, despite their website posting my appointment date and time.  I was never given an apology or an explanation of what happened.

The concept of someone repairing your car at home is a good one.  But if you use THIS business make sure that you double/triple check that someone is actually going to come or you risk taking time off work and wasting your day for nothing like I did!<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<response>None</response><Review>I have been there during daytime, very, very nice and clean and we'll taken care of. I'm sure the big baseball field has nothing to do with that though. Out playing with my suicidal drone one afternoon and I look around and there's a boy in a base-a-ball uni looking at me. Let's do the time warp again! No, no. Anyway I asked if he was going to play a game that day. Yes he said, and your in center field! No way dude, I didn't even have a glove! Told him look, I'm busy picking up drone pieces and no one his size is going to hit to deep center field and if they do, it's a home run anyway! A couple crashes later he said bye as there must have been 3outs or my deep center reasoning made sense. Picked up pieces of drone and booked it as fog was rolling in. I did see one person waving, I wavied back, hope he hit a homer at his next time at bat.< /Review>< Rate>

I'll be honest... I love this park. Very clean and children are always having fun here including my own babies. There is barbecue places, a field, and the location is right next to a school and down the street is a grocery store. Plenty of parking and a nice comfortable walking path big enough for bicycle riding and any wheel chairs. Variety of playground amenities for the children to have fun and seating if you get tired. Plus plenty of shade and developed in a comfortable neighborhood. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to bring your children here God bless.</Review>

Very dirty. I have been there so many times. One time there were group of young men smoking 🚬 and so many kids playing. I called the phone number that is posted, no answer. The city just doesn't seem to care.< /Text>

Beautiful Park , there a section for toddlers and a section for bigger kids and I also have a lovely shaded picnic area. My only concern is there is a old Pond cover in rocks and I think it's dangerous for the kids because it's a deep ditch, there needs to fence around it or cover it in dirt so the kids don't get hurt<//review>

I love this park! You can sit right in front of playground and keep a good eye on your babies. It also has the padded playground so it feels great under your feet. If you visit close to end of school hours you will also find the I've cream truck and coffee shake truck available for treats.<//Text>

<review>It's a beautiful park in a very nice area. From what I saw the park itself was very clean. The water play area is well maintained. I didn't use the restroom so I can't say anything about it. I'd visit again.< /review>< Name>

<review>The park is beautiful, but to get the most out of your experience, I highly recommend taking a tour. I went with South African and American colleagues and our guide was impartial and gave thoughtful answers to our many questions. My one regret is not leaving enough time to explore the museum more. If you are going to Pretoria, and especially if you plan to visit the Voortrekker Monument, it’s a must.< /review>< pics>

Took my grandma, my wife and cousin here and enjoyed every minute of it. My grandma enjoyed the views, videos and demonstrations so much she forgot about her painful knees and walked at least whole 2 kms. Well maintained place and views of Pretoria looked great.< /text>

<Text>The slide was way to fast and the kids kept getting hurt on it. The whole playground erea smelled like urine😨🤢🤤, and the little airplane was dangerous.  My son hurt his back on it by simply rocking on it as was made for. Overall , this is a nice neighborhood,  horrible, horrible , horrible park.

Nice park to spend an afternoon. Splash pad wasn't on yet so that was a bummer but had a big climbing wall that my 6 & 9 year old loved to climb on. Lots of trees for shade.</Text>

Love this park. Clean. And even if it rained the day before the play ground is rubber so its not muddy. Not as much bugs as most parks. In a good neighborhood and no tweakers roaming around. A soccer field so my one year old can run around... a basketball hoop... and even a concrete trail that goes around the park where you can push strollers around, roller blade, or jog!</review>

<Review>Situatedalmost adjacent to the city station and around the corner from the well-known Voortrekker monument (with its harsh architecture compared to Freedom Park's artistic spaces), the museum is best visited with a companion and a good sun hat. The exterior is as worth studying and enjoying as the beautifully laid out interior. Story-telling inside and outside follows a modern flow, with visually arresting presentations. Compared also to the very harsh Apartheid Museum, the same sad history is told just as poignantly but with more visual appeal. Can we have more people visit this museum, to bring it to life? Its staff needs to look at ensuring canteen and staffing during visits are at all times ready for visitors.< /Review>< Resp>

This park has two play structures, baby and big kid swings and a water feature for kids to run through.  The water can be turned on at 2:00 PM. There is plenty of shade and benches to sit. It's located in a nice neighborhood.<//text>

<Text>The city has allowed this park to fall apart, or at least the playground equipment. The adult swings are completely gone, mainly because after school when the kids from the middle school get out waiting for their parents, the swings would deliberately get twisted or vandalized and the school does nothing to curb the kids from destroying them.
It's still one of the safest parks in Modesto, so far.
The water fountains are only on a few times during the Summers.
Sadly, that has been reduced because of the water shortages and city controls, again taking away a characteristic of the park.</Text><Response>None</Response><Name>Steven Bosma</Name><Rate>4<//Rate><UserId.>113586666100080368140< /UserId.><pictures>None</pictures>< gmapID>

Used to be one of the nicest parks in modesto,  unfortunately teenagers in the community have broken parts of the play structure.   Still a decent park to take the kids to play during the summer.</Review>

<Text>Nice park. Love the water feature. Kids of all ages seem  to enjoy this park. I do wish the water operation hours and dates were easier to come by. While lookimg them up on the website. It stated memorial day May 25th 2018. It was operating on the 26th( assuming  it started on the 25th) but actual  Memorial day was May 28th, 2018 this year. Confusing as to when it was actually starting.< /Text>< pics>

<text>This was exactly what we were looking for when searching a breakfast spot in San Francisco.  Excellent food. Great hip atmosphere. The scrambled eggs were to die for. Homemade toast and blueberry streusel cake. Even though we are only here for 5 days we may have to go back.</text>< pictures>

The french toast, the scrambles (any or all), and even the vegetarian  black bean cake breakfasts - it all works here.  Amazing breakfasts, pastries, and coffee.  Tables are always filled, so come early and expect to wait.  Even so, for however long you might wait, it's worth it.  Best breakfast in San Francisco, hands down.<//review>

{'time': 1566544658053, 'text': 'Dear Jill,\n\nWe have been with Mealpal since their inception in San Francisco two years ago.  We do not offer any salad with chicken as we try to be vegan or vegetarian.  The only day we have a full salad is on Mondays and that salad is a cape cod salad with walnuts, cranberries and apple with arugula as the base with a house dressing.\n\nWe give a full salad which is bigger than most restaurants offer for $12 or more in the Financial District. That same salad is served in house for $10.50 at the café but you pay around $5 so there is no question that we are cheating here.\n\nI think you either have us mixed up with another café or you must have read the description wrong.  Either way, I hope you give us another chance as we have plenty of other offerings through mealpal and we have a very dedicated happy following.\n\nRekha Mukhia\nNewtree America'}<//response>

I am obsessed with New Tree. Found out about it through MealPal, and now I consistently reserve my MealPal meals with NewTree, and have tried other goodies there, too. The cafe is so calming and serene, it really is such a nice quiet break. And the food is awesome - very flavorful, and I love the amount of vegetarian options. The staff are always incredibly nice and courteous, too.

Note: google maps will send you the wrong way, if you're on California street, it's in that little plaza at 345 California, near the SF soup company. I almost couldn't find it the first time, but I'm so glad I did!< /Text>

I visited on a Monday morning, I was surprised the place empty, but likely because it is tucked around the back of the building, behind SF Soup Co.

The place has lots of seats, it is clean, and the staff is friendly.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80858061ec9db5a5:0x6e11b8fa30f0b92b< /Gmap_id><resp>{'time': 1533569234638, 'text': 'Thank you for your kind review Michael. Have a great start of the week !'}</resp>< name>

(Translated by Google) We had breakfast. The staff helps you in your choices or advice. They are various choices of chocolate, coffee, tea and cakes. Attention this company is a place of meals quite busy with bulding workers so there is nothing at certain hours ... the breakfasts are for example from 7h to 9h30 see 10h after they are on the meals of 12h . As for the prices it is correct for San Francisco after it is expensive for us European compared to the service. Do not compare Europe and usa otherwise we would not eat anything for restaurants

Nous avons pris un petit déjeuner. Le personnel vous aides dans vos choix ou conseil. Ils sont divers choix de chocolat, café, thé et gâteaux.

Concernant les prix c’est correcte pour San Francisco après c’est cher pour nous européens par rapport à la prestation.

I love to have a fresh meat market close by.
They count whith a good variety of needed items like fresh fruit and vegetables.
I also like the fact they have a taco shop and deli!</Text>

<review>First time I ate here and was not impressed. Meat on torta had no flavor seemed like it was boiled. Flautas were drowned in a sourcream guacamole didn’t taste like guacamole. Horchata was super sweet, more like milk and sugar taste. It may be a long time before I come here again.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4hcOq2cUY7O4Vad6RlVIYtoRKMTLHpu3RAwrw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAfkwX2Lwxqr_UlDWrPRlz962D33K2Ayth5C0T=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOK_mCSVvI7Lvs-mAzG_x4I25LVJCH_lQcvFTHT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Text>If you appreciate a classic small town restaurant specializing in great Mexican dishes, give Mejia's a visit. Handily located on Madera Avenue (CA Hwy 145) between Hwy 99 and Gateway Drive. It is always welcoming and my Carnitas Taco plate was awesome.</Text><name>Jerrold Kazynski</name><GmapID>0x80940c87c26bac15:0xcfddf225522006d1<//GmapID>< Time>

We like it but they don't offer refills on fountain drinks. They charge a full cup's price. Some menu items are not available like guacamole.< /text>

< Review>
Authentic mexican food at affordable prices.  This little restaurant offers both takeout and dine in options.  I've eaten both lunch and breakfast here and will continue to come back.  This is a small establishment that is locally owned.  The staff is friendly and knowledgable.< /Review>

<Review>The food is very good, the service was great. My daughter and I stopped by on her lunch break, they were pretty quick in bringing  our order out to us. The server was very polite, we will be returning soon.< /Review>< name>

<Review>Just came from Mejias on Gateway  Dr.  The food was not what i expected.  Wed been coming here for years but for the past couple of times we've been there the food has been bad and service sucks.  I ordered to take home and i should have known something was wrong because i noticed the chili all over the place.  I did not ask for nobody nine containers of chili.  I ordered a plain cheese burger and i got a double ith bacon and jalapeños.  So i couldn't eat it.  And the meat is not fresh it is frozen.  Very disappointed.  I will not be going there anymore.  Everything sucks about it.  I rate it a 0 stars.  No good at all.  I wouldnt feed that frozen meat patty to my dog.< /Review>< rate>

Delicious food. Great customer service. It was a two hour wait to get a table for a party of 7( that was the only downfall). I would definitely go back.<//text>

Not only is the food outrageously good here, but so are their drinks!!!
The Chile Verde plate with two eggs on top are the bomb!!
It's so yummy!!😋
The perfect brunch! 😍👌< /text>

Like the other 2 El Comal's great food and great service. This one has a little more to offer than the other 2. They have a full alcohol selection and non alcohol selection. It was decorated very colorful 😍 it was a nice change in scenery.<//Review>

Nice restaurant and nice service. The carne asada burrito is big and they use good quality meat. I recommend eating the carne asada fries at the restaurant. It is a good take out option but nothing g beats fries when they are just made and crispy.</review>

Use to love this place, seems that quality & taste of food has definitely declined.
I left a whole half plate of food on the table with no desire to take it when I left.< /review>

The aroma of this place walking in makes you hungry. Colorful walls and decor makes you feel right at home. So far one of the best menudo I had. This little gem has popusas and many other delicious dishes on the menu. A must visit around Lake Elsinore city. Enjoy!</review>

Good food. Only complaint is we called ahead and asked if 9 can sit together. We're told no problem. When we arrived they said only 6 per table.< /Text>

Good food. Only complaint is we called ahead and asked if 9 can sit together. We're told no problem. When we arrived they said only 6 per table.< /Text>

Had a very delicious dinner. Mexican Pozole, Salvadorean Tamales and Pupusas.  The staff was courteous and attentive. Our waitress was very nice, attentive and professional. For dessert we had Platanitos Dulces with vanilla ice cream, super yummy especially the fried plantains. Tonight they had live music, not sure if it's an every day thing. I think the prices are great. Under $40 for all our food, dessert and tip. Highly recommended.< /Review>

< Review>
El Comal Family Restaurant is located in an old looking shopping center, the parking is terrible, and traffic in and out is atrocious.  However, once you open the door you enter a colorful tropical atmosphere, adorned with classic Hispanic artwork throughout. The food was good. I had the Caldo de Pollo (chicken soup) which was very good. The broth was light and well flavored, vegetables were cooked just right, and I was given a large piece of chicken (on the bone). The taste brought instant gratification, as it reminded me of the soup my grandmother would make when I was a child. We got a lot of food (see picture) for a great price. Everything pictured including drinks was just $27! If you are in the area, and not in a hurry, stop by and enjoy a bite to eat.< /Review>

<text>Just drove across town to pick up a phone order. Food was cold and mushy and missing ingredients and smashed in the to-go bag. My wife and I both called and were put on hold for a few minutes. Manager (I'm assuming) refused to refund any money unless we brought the food back or sent pictures. He said they "can't package everything perfectly" and needed proof that our food wasn't correct. Working from home and driving across town and then having to get an argument when we're not happy is not something I need to deal with. It's not as easy as just driving back to deal with the food because you don't believe my complaint- after we were home and realized their mistakes. A simple phone call about our concerns was met with a very unfriendly and defensive employee. Will not return!<//text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1605558438604, 'text': 'Sir I refunded your entire order which was a total of $32.16.

It was take out but the food was terrific. The margaritas were pretty good too. They make their own mix. They use good quality tequila. Can't wait until I can sit up at their bar and enjoy an adult beverage.< /text>

<Text>Camal's has always been good, a little pricey though. Now I feel we need to Just wait to eat out. Selection of the menu items is very small in most restaurants. Seen tables touched by customers as they moved them from bar area to seating in the

dining room with no cleaning of area to bring in another group of people and put them at the same table.... Not good. I'm a first responder and feel we all need to wait for a proper opening.</Text>< Pictures>

To bad I can't give 0 stars. Don't go there if you are white or considered Caucasian. We were looked at as if we were trash and in the wrong place. The waitress  talked to us in Spanish and gave us a dirty look when we said we didn't speak Spanish. NEVER going back!<//Review>

It was awful & it was the second time I ate there,first time I ate fish tacos. It was like they were made with fish sticks. I gave it another try it was a little better not much, I had 3 taquittos & rice & beans. It cost me over 11$ and no drink, I won't be back there.</Review>

< Review>
El Comal Family Restaurant is located in an old looking shopping center, the parking is terrible, and traffic in and out is atrocious.  However, once you open the door you enter a colorful tropical atmosphere, adorned with classic Hispanic artwork throughout. The food was good. I had the Caldo de Pollo (chicken soup) which was very good. The broth was light and well flavored, vegetables were cooked just right, and I was given a large piece of chicken (on the bone). The taste brought instant gratification, as it reminded me of the soup my grandmother would make when I was a child. We got a lot of food (see picture) for a great price. Everything pictured including drinks was just $27! If you are in the area, and not in a hurry, stop by and enjoy a bite to eat.< /Review>

It’s hot outside so I decided to stop for a cold soft drink. Walking in was nice and cool, clean and just welcoming. So I decided to try something off the menu 🤤   Being I’m from L. A. I think I found one of those spots we’re all looking for.  I’m recording this for those who just might be interested.<//Review><userid>110005649156737912523< /userid>< gmapID>

<text>The food here is amazing! I couldn't decide between the enchiladas or the tacos so I got both and was not disappointed. They just started serving margaritas recently and those were great too!

The food is amazing here! I tried the albondigas soup, and now I'm never getting it from any place except for here. The service is okay, but I don't blame them for them being busy. I really recommend this place!</Review>

The place is really clean and all the food that I have tried is really good, exact amount of salt and portions. Very affordable for everyone and the most for big family. The service is great and they work the fastest that they can, that is -we don't  have to wait so long.I absolutely recommended this place.< /Text>

This place was on Mission Trail in Lake Elsinore, I didn't quite enjoy the food they're as I do in their new location now. It has great service more space, and the food is delicious and not greasy like any other cultural Foods that I have come across in my span of dining at restaurants. It is a mix of both Salvadorian and Mexican food with a taste of Spanish culture in the atmosphere. Well worth the eat.</Review>

Mediocre at best. I was excited to see a restaurant with a full bar, but the food is sub-par. Canned mushrooms in a vegetable omelet doesn’t appeal to anybody- stop using them or lower the price. The gravy on the biscuits and gravy is made from an instant powder and the potatoes, although ordered ‘crispy’ came out close to raw. Other restaurants are priced similarly but use way better quality food.<//review>

This place is perfect. The prices are fair, and the food is always well-prepared and delicious. The menu has both Mexican and Salvadorian options. There's a Taco Tuesday and Monday through Friday Happy Hour. The servers are so nice. We go every week or every other week. I recommend it to anyone who has a liking for "comida casera".<//text>

So I am really not the type to give a bad rating unless it is supper necessary. Dont get me wrong they have really good food, but there problem is the staff. They get too caught up in the chisme that they dont pay attention to their work. The only reason I am rating this place is because it is not the first second or third time this happens... just about every time we take out they forget to give us an item we ordered or the agua fresca has gone bad. I usually call in advance to order and I'll send someone to pick up... so today I called several time's but the phone sounded busy. So I told my husband just go and order there they might be busy. So he does he gets there and it takes them about 30min just to take his order... that's fine we know they get supper busy, he orders and they say it will be about 30min. So he waits 30-45min. I call and say hey what happened it's been over an hr. He says well the lady is all up in the chisme and she has all of these orders ready behind her not sure if one of them is ours... so he goes and asks, sure enough his order had come out over 15min ago. So he leaves and forgets he orded some agua fresca aswell... I think that if they know what you ordered it's there job to check what they are giving you and say hey hold on you are missing the drink or something... nope they give him his order and continue the chisme. So there for I am rating this place a 2 star because of the horrible service we have had when we take out. And every time this happens I call just to let them know so that they correct their service but I guess they just don't care.<//Text>

Good food, friendly courteous staff.

CON's
1st visit.

Placed takeout order and was told a time frame.  Arrived and had to wait an additional 15 plus minutes.

2nd visit.

We waited to be seated like everyone else about twenty minutes.

3rd visit.
Made reservations and was told not to be late.  We arrived 15 minutes before our reservation time and was seated 45 minutes later.  Ordered drinks and nachos appetizer.  I finished my drink (slowly) I might add and our appetizer finally arrived in 20 minutes.  Sorry it does not take that long to make nachos.  We were not offered additional chips or drinks while we waited for the appetizer.  We had planned on ordering main courses but everything took soooo long that we decided to just stop with the appetizer.

The take away is good food, nice staff.  Owner management needs to figure out TIME MANAGEMENT.  If you are short staffed you need to pay more attention to your patrons with something, more chips and salsa, comped drinks something to warrant the delay.  Waitress and establishment  loss was a bigger? revenue.

Amazing place for authentic Salvadoran food. Their pupusas are the best I’ve had in all of Southern California. Their prices are low, their customer service is great (they’re all if not most fluent in English and Spanish) and their food is delicious. Great for family or just brunch with friends. They serve alcohol here too! Overall, best place to get pupusas!</text>

El Comal just recently relocated to this location. The restaurant is back and better than ever! I love the decorations inside. The staff was super friendly, helpful, and patient. A great spot for Salvadoran food. Pupusas are a must.</review>

<Text>This place has a wide variety of Mexican and Salvadoran dishes for any taste. I have enjoyed their pupusas a couple times and they are the best! Prices are totally reasonable and they have happy hour on appetizers and drinks. I wish they had another store near Temecula.

We tried El Comal for the first time and were impressed, the food was very good and at reasonable prices. The atmosphere was nice and the service was accommodating. They're also open early for breakfast which is a nice option. We'll definitely be going back.< /Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Truthfully, I had heard good things about this restaurant, but probably never would have visited it except yesterday a friend brought me what I believe she called papusas from the restaurant and I’m hooked. They taste kind of like a cheese tamale, but look like a pancake with a coleslaw type salad to top them. I’ve never had anything like this. I was sceptical but it is SO good! The salsa is my new favorite and I’m looking forward to going and trying their other options. Really good!<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

My dad and mom were patrons of El Comal since the old location.  With mom gone now dad insists on his visits.  Hesitantly I always abided.  Customer Service is key for me.  Food is second.  Lets start with service.   And I understand not everyone is meant for the industry, but for the most part this staff is fine.  With the exception of one.  TAKE NOTE;  Ysenia far exceeds any exceptions one would find at a restaurant.  You typically find her level of service in fine dining.  i would definitely keep my eye on her and write my SOP (standard operating procedure) for all new hires that are going to be working the floor.

Now the food, as my dad is a fan, i became one too with reservation.  The food is good, all the dishes I've tried so far had been done well.  The pupusas are amazing if you eat there.  Don't take home.    Their Chile  Verde was also great.  Now thier hard shell shredded beef tacos are KILLER.  Why am i not raving about their food.  Well I am.  As i would of any other latin restaurant that served food my grandmother could easily out perform.  I am hispanic and know latin food.  I say this with love and in hopes my comments assist.  I could get this at most good mexican restaurants.  But who want good.  I want GREAT!  A little kick in authenticity would go a long way.  A pinch in presentation i believe essential.  I begin eating with my eyes before it touches my mouth.

We will be back, my father insists.  I love the new decor.  The bar looks amazing and $15 FOR BOTTOMLESS MIMOSA BRUCH!  Im there!!!  IF MY FATHER BELIEVES IN YOU IM SURE I WILL TOO!!!!!<//review>

< Review>
We only live a few blocks away but it took around 2 yrs. .We finally ate at at this place. It's literally a hole in the wall. This became our favorite Mexican resturant in lake Elsinore. Excellent food with excellent service. My only regret is it took us 2 yrs. to find it.</Review>

First time we've been to this restaurant it was recommended by a friend. The food was great reminded me of a nice restaurant we went to in Rosarita beach in Mexico. Excellent friendly service we will definitely be back.</Text>

Love the Papusas, and taco night, best tasting street taco's in the area for a great deal.
Customer service is great.... always busy so expect a bit of a wait but not too long. Enjoy!!</Text>

The only thing I would say is that they need to work on their Mexican food, I ordered two tacos de Al pastor and it tasted like soggy meat with red food coloring.<//text>

Horrible customer servic, I placed an order on the phone, drove 30 minutes to wait another 40 minutes at the restaurant just so they could get my order wrong. No tortillas and the food was cold. I will NEVER go back there. When I called the manager tried to tell me to drive back 30 minutes for a "free meal" worst Sunday morning. I was hoping to feed 6 people but now we have to visit a different place<//Text>

<Text>Food was great but service was horrible. When we complained about their service 2 of their people decided to blame other customers for their slow service. We didn't get a "I am sorry for that " instead it was "We weren't expecting another party to sit on the patio."<//Text>< rate>

El Comal is without a doubt this region's best choice for authentic Mexican style food. Place is beautiful. Should be a historical town landmark now that El Comal is occupying the spot. These guys were a hit decades before moving to this location. I'll eat at El Comal before I go to any of the other like cuisines here. I'm just happy they re-opened after their fire. Anyways take this advice... nowhere can you go in this town to find a better experience. They have a private party room for b-days, weddings, cinses, whatever. They have a bar with game television coverages that you can dine at as well as regular booth and table seating. Uber family friendly oriented. The decor is really cool. When the El Comal family had to move from their last place they used their insurance re-build money wisely. Their new location is bomb. Food is (as usual) bomb, people are no, not bomb... loveable and special. Good family operation. The Dogman of Lake Elsinore has spoken...so be it...and they all said...Amen!</text>

When this restaurant opened a few months ago, the food was great. Now the pupusas and bananas are dry. Last night, my husband's corn tortillas were raw. My shrimp pozole had no seasoning.. We are so sad but we can't continue to eat there.<//text>

<Review>Went there today and saw the host tell one family, "ill get you in on the next table that opens up" without having considerations for the other families such as mine that were already waiting for an hour. I get it, opening weekend but if you want to run a succesful business be courteous to your customers. By the way, I left because of the service I saw today.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80dc975ca75d3daf:0x4fc011b512d7e2ee< /GmapID></record>

The food is horrible! The pupusas are huge but don't do it justice. It is also overpriced and the quality of the food doesn't match the prices. The aguas frescas also overpriced and they put so much ice in the cup. Just all bad I will not be going back ever.<//Review>

<Text>Food is ok but the service was horrible! Waited 45 minutes to get our food. When I brought to the attention of the manager, they blamed the large party that was seated outside. No apology for the wait. I will never return here again!<//Text>< pics>

The food arrived at the table only half warm. And the server wasn't bad, they were just very slow all through the meal. The food tasted okay, but nothing special. I may have just had a bad night, but I won't be wasting another one to find out.</review>

They are trying to get you in and seated but compared to the old restaurant the food is not the same I ordered a chili Verde burrito I had one bite and that was all. The food is not as good as it was once before.</Text>

Finally found a place with authentic mexican food!!! Menudo is so delicious here. This place reminds me of moms home cooking. I live 20 minutes away but do not mind the drive. Best food from Fallbrook to Corona. Give it a try, you will love it.</Review>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>This place has vibrant  decor, which I found quite beautiful. Great variety of dishes: breakfast, Mexican and Salvadorian food. It was hard to choose since everything sounded amazing, but chose two popusas and a shrimp tostada. The shrimp tostada was loaded (they don't skimp on the shrimp)and the popusas were bigger than expected. My mom got a shrimp salad which I tried and I would recommend; flavorful without the need for dressing.</Text>< Pics>

Wow wow!!!! Coming from a guy that has walked out of restaurants that were not good!! This place takes the cake. 100% authentic home made like my moms. The service was just a good. We will never ever visit any other Mexican restaurant anywhere in S California except Javier's in New Port Coast. El Comal reminds me of the original Javiers when they were in Laguna Beach. Provecho!!<//review>

<text>I work nearby and I frequent this place twice a week sometimes. The food is very tasty and cooked to order and better than that is the friendly people who cook and serve there. I've had everything on the menu and my top three are the chiles rellenos, caldo de pollo (chicken soup), and last but not least the Campechana which is a seafood cocktail. Deeeeeeeeelicious!</text>< Pictures>

Go there 4 to 5 times a month. We have never been disappointed. Best Birria I have ever had made with goat. Their Pasole  and Menudo are equally fantastic. Don't forget to take an order on their Buñuelo home when you go.<//review>

I'm a food fanatic and I must say this place is the best of the best for the town it's in you can't go wrong.the service on point that salsa they serve with the chips is to die for good variety on the menu but I don't want to spoil your appetite go get some and find out just why I'm writing this..</Review>

(Translated by Google) Excellent colorful and relaxing atmosphere. The food very tasty. They make good pupusas, chilaquiles, seafood, fresh waters, The other day that we were my friends we ate very rich and unhurried, the order did not take long to get warm and very good taste The service is always excellent. The owner very kind too! I will be back.

(Translated by Google) Until now I have only liked the pupusas since the tongue is very chopped into small pieces the beef broth is better in the Cárdenas and I have not liked the enchiladas the bread that is in the stand at the entrance I do not recommend it but I am willing to give two more chances to see if he changed his mind since it is not a cheap place at all, quite the opposite, it is very expensive in general its Mexican cuisine is not the best, to see I will try the Salvadoran to see how it goes

(Original)
Hasta ahorita sólo las pupusas me han gustado ya que la lengua está muy picada en pedazos chiquitos el caldo de res está mejor en el Cárdenas y tampoco me han gustado las enchiladas el pan que está en el  stand de la entrada tampoco te lo recomiendo pero estoy dispuesto a dar dos chances más a ver si cambió de parecer ya que para nada es un lugar económico todo lo contrario es muy caro en general no es de lo mejor su cocina mexicana a ver probaré la salvadoreña a ver que tal</Text>

(Translated by Google) Quite colorful and relaxing atmosphere. Very tasty food. They make good pupusas !!! The other day my husband and I went and he could not eat hot sauce with the pupusas, we asked if they had a sauce that was not spicy. They pleased him with a sauce without chili !!! The service is always excellent. The owner very friendly too!

Bastante colorido y relajante el ambiente.  La comida muy sabrosa.  Hacen unas buenas pupusas!!!  El otro día que fuimos mi esposo y yo y el no podia comer salsa picante con las pupusas,  pedimos si tenian una salsa que no fuera picante.  Le complacieron con una salsa sin chile!!!  El servicio siempre es excelente.  La dueña muy amable también!< /Review>
