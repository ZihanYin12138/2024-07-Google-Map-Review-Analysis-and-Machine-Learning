I ordered a computer card for dodge Ram 1500, As soon as we installed in the car it worked perfectly well. All functions returned. It is a wonderful purchase for me.
The customer service is also impeccable. I had some shipment delay from the part of the carrier and Ares technologies staff followed up closely and reported to me. Superb!<//text>

Jennifer was a great help getting the ecm for my jeep.  After getting the run around from another company I called Ares Technologies only to be met with great customer service and very quick turnaround. All I can say is I recommend them for all your ecm needs.</text>

<Review>Just bought my truck and wouldn't you know it the engine light was on. Took to a mechanic and he said the PCM was bad. $450+ to put a used one in. I read the reviews and went with ARES Technologies to order one.
Followed the instructions on YouTube and installed my unit. Truck purrs like a kitten and everything is back up and working again!
The delivery was quick, and buying it on their secure sight was a breeze! If your wondering if all these reviews are true, all I gotta say is these guys ROCK! Wish I could give em 10 stars! Thanks ARES, for helping me get my Dodge 5.2 2001 4X4 1500 back on the road.<//Review><resp>{'time': 1625108220160, 'text': 'Dear Pappy,\nIt is a pleasure to serve our customers.

ARES is the best company for auto modules that I have ever worked with! I have worked in multiple shops, as a manager at a chain auto parts store, and on vehicles for years. They are extraordinarily knowledgeable, very friendly and helpful, and quick. At the time of this review, I have purchased three PCMs with zero issues and fabulous support. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</Review>

This company was very responsive and professional from start to finish. The customer service was great, price was good and product worked correctly the first time. I worked with other companies out of my state and their product and customer service was the worst. I’m happy to have finally found a good honest company to work with. A+++< /Text>

I used these guys for a transmission control module for an Allison transmission. It was a really quick and painless process. They programed the module to the VIN on my truck so I didn't have to get a dealership or shop to program it for me, just plug it in and go. I'll definitely use this service again if the need arises again.</Text>

< Review>
The person I spoke with initially was rude, and not customer friendly. I expressed my concerns and he told me i did not know what I was talking about.

When it came time to return the product as I knew it would not work, I had to pay for the return. Fine no problem, but they could not give me a clear answer as to when I would receive a refund, and initially told me I would be charged a reprogram fee. Which I don’t agree with as the part did not fit, which again I tried to explain to their representative. The instructions that came with the part might as well have been written in a foreign language and were incomplete. The pictures looked half done.

It is now three days since they received my part back they got it back on Friday 3/19/2021, today is Monday 3/22/2021and I still have no word as to when to expect a full refund. I called at 3:45 central standard time and was told, “oh we got it late Friday, but someone will reach out to you soon.” When? Who? This place is poorly run and managed by very rude people.

Nobody knows anything you get vague answers or told you don’t know what you’re talking about. I do not recommend purchasing anything from them.<//Review>

<review>Fantastic service. My Jeep had a few issues and a simple plug and play wouldn’t work. ARES worked with me to determine exactly what my vehicle needed and sent me a custom programmed computer that worked perfectly. When the job got complicated they didn’t give me a hard time or raise the price- they made it right and saw it through. You can’t go wrong with ARES. Highly recommend.<//review>< pics>

Turned out it wasn’t the ECM but it was a loose plug on the crankshaft sensor. Anyway my Jeep used to idle too slow and the new ECM fixed that issue so it didn’t solve the problem I thought I had but it fixed something else.<//review>< pics>

As it was explained with our sales team multiple times, you haven't been charged any amount for shipping and we offered free UPS 2nd day air shipping. All shipping carriers including UPS have waived any service guarantees since March 2020 and any delay from them, is out of our hands.\nYou placed the order during the weekend, we shipped the part on Monday free of charge and the part most likely will be delivered to you tomorrow which will be only 3 business days. Since you are not satisfied with our service, we informed the shipping department to intercept the package and request UPS to return it to our facility. We will fully refund you as soon as we receive the part.\nSorry for the inconvenience and have a very good day."}</Response>< gmap_id>

<Text>Ecm lost communication after a few months installed in my vehicle and only 63 miles of driving, due to the shop I used not sending the core back I don't have a warranty. But for the price I paid for the ecm better customer service was expected. Between the rude customer service and the fact that a qualified mechanic confirmed that the computer was no good I lost all respect for this company... stay clear use another company.... That is not what I was informed on the phone, and I guess your out here driving my car. The car was a project car that I was building and has less then 100 miles on the build. CAR HAS BEEN OFF THE ROAD SINCE 2017 AND PUT BACK ON THE ROAD APRIL 2021, so go back to your horrible business practice hacks FACTS: I PUT 63 MILES ON THE CAR with documentation...either way 9 month old 600 dollar computer minus 6 months of snowy winter that you couldn't drive a corvette around here leaves 3 months of actual use and it fails, sounds like trash product< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

You were informed that you need to return the core back to activate your lifetime warranty and you refused to do so and this is despite the fact that we provided a return label to send the core back at no cost. You know better than us that you were driving the car more than 100 miles since you purchased the module 9 months ago in September. From the little information you were willing to provide when we asked about the issues the vehicle was experiencing up until your call today, we were going to offer you $150 core charge to activate your warranty but you have decided to go another route and that is understandable, and we retract the offer, since you still wish to drive the vehicle without any regard to our policies."}<//response>

<Review>ARES Technologies! Amazing!  I’ve been shopping around, dealt with a-lot of companies. These guys had a real price reasonable. They weren’t trying to calculate all these other companies. They had the best customer service experience and the shipping was fanomaly quick. Overall my experience was the best and I would recommend this company to anyone..< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

< review>
I had a horrible experience at fs1, who did such a horrible job that I was not certain about purchasing another computer online for my Dodge Ram. After seeing all the positive reviews here I decided to give it a shot even though the other company was attempting not to refund me even though they never sent me Anything. In fact I still haven’t received all my money from them, but My experience with Ares was the complete opposite of my first experience buying a pcm.  Ares did everything right. They made it easy to place my order. They sent me the correct part as quickly as they said they would. The part was as close to new as it could be, and it plugged in and worked just like it was supposed to. It restored my faith in purchasing parts online after my previous situation. And I would recommend this place to anyone who wants great service, fair prices, snd no hassles. Thank you Ares. You did a fantastic job.</review>

< Review>
I had ordered a PCM for my truck from a different company.  After waiting for a month and half, the company canceled the order.  I contacted ARES Technologies immediately.  I had the PCM within 3 weeks (it was backordered which ARES told me when I ordered the part).
The customer service was excellent.  I appreciated the fact that they were completely honest about how long it would take to get the part in, how long to program it, and what day I could expect it.  I received the part the exact day they said it would be there.
I will be buying parts from this company from now on.<//Review>

Ares Technology had the part I needed, at a much better price than I found anywhere else. They also included a lifetime warranty. I was also able to have it shipped overnight. I would definitely purchase from them again, and recommend their products without hesitation.</Review>

Ordered a new pcm for my 2005 grand cherokee limited 5.7.  Works excellent and solved my issue (going into limp mode, lightening bolt on dash)  I've now put on over 500 miles and everything's working perfectly.</text>

< Review>
2nd time having to replace in the 05 Escape.  first one, we bought from Flagship for a hell of a lot more and ZERO customer service. Decided to give ARES a try this time.  I called pre purchase to make sure we did not need to program any keys. The girl that helped me was prompt and knowledgeable! So very helpful.  I called in again when we got the unit and I was helped right away and had no issues.  Plug and play and off we went!<//Review>

Got a replacement Trans computer for a Jeep Wrangler. It looked like a used one that had been sand blasted to look good. Works OK so I can't complain. Didn't have to return a core which is a plus. Price was right.</text>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Module was delivered within a week of being ordered. This included them having a backorder situation. Support was clear and communication was good. Price was less then what my dealer wanted to charge me to pull a part from a junk yard and it would have had no warranty. Ares even includes the return shipping for the core. Amazing experience from start to finish, would highly recommend this company. If I should ever have a computer problem again, my business will go here.

I had been waiting weeks to find someone that had the part - my only vehicle and no transportation.  Well easy order and now awaiting delivery from UPS.  Well UPS lost the part.  On Saturday I email ARES about the lost package.  They called me within an hour and was sending me a replacement at no charge on the following Monday.  By Weds afternoon my part arrived and my Jeep was up and running.  They saved my day, week and after a month waiting my month.  Thank You!< /Text>< pictures>

<username>Adolfo Delgado<//username><Date>1595440423774<//Date><Rate>5</Rate><Review>After many days looking for my manual transmission jeep's computer module (online and locally), ARES Technologies had the best price, 40% cheaper than any other vendor. I called them up, gave them my VIN # and they processed the purchase right away. They told me that I could return the ECM if that was not the issue with my jeep, but that it would take 2 to 3 weeks because they did not have it in stock. To my surprise, I received the unit within a week. The unit seems to be a rebuilt rather than a refurbished unit, which is a plus. I plugged in and voila, my jeep was alive again. After driving my Jeep for 3 months, I have had no problems so far. I shipped the damaged module back (package and mail label was provided) to them, so I will get the lifetime warranty on the rebuilt module. Thank you!< /Review>< pics>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>I want to give Ares Technology a 200 star review . My husband lost his keys to the only car we have. He has to drive 100 miles one way to the VA hospital for cancer treatments. We did everything we could think of to stop the Anti Theft system. That prevented him from starting his 1997 Jeep Grand Cherokee. We where ready to hall it in for junk. We called lock Smiths changed the ignition got a new key fob and even thought about changing the modulators. We didn't no what els to do. Then I found Ares Technologies, on the Web. So I called, I told them about what was going on and they said they could help use. So we followed what they told use to do. They where so friendly and reassuring. I was so worried about how my husband was going to get to his treatment's. And WA-LA it worked. I could have saved so much money if I just new about them and what they could do. Thank you SO MUCH Ares Technology. I feel like you where a life saver. Laterally                 Sensearly  Linda Melton<//text><username>Linda Melton< /username>< pictures>

<text>Had a couple issues and they stood by their product and made it right. Customer service was easy to deap with and returned emails super fast. If you understand their business and the common issues with it just be patient and they will make it right. I am giving them 5 stars for their customer service and sticking with it and making it right in the end without having to make a big deal out of it. They were understanding and never lost temper or got out of hand.< /text>< Pictures>

I bought be a new pcm for my jeep from ares which worked fine for a couple months then for some reason it wouldn't work.  No problem they sent me a new pcm to replace the faulty one.  The problem I had with the new pcm is that it didn't come programmed to my key so my car would not start or run. I had to have my jeep towed to the dealership and have the pcm reprogrammed to my key which cost me $380. I asked ares to refund this amount and was told no. Even though the website states plug and play. They only offered for me to return the pcm for a refund. The problem with that is that I would now not even have the old pcm I sent them to at least get my car moving.  I guess plug and play means different things to different people.  There goes your perfect 5 on your reviews.

To your reply it is a very simple matter that the 2nd pcm was not programmed to my car. The complaint has nothing to do with the 1st pcm. If your wanting the paperwork from the dealership stating the pcm was not programmed I can easily email that to you.<//Text>

{'time': 1608866821688, 'text': "Dear Billy,\nThank you for your review. Your story has multiple false claims so we will post our version of the events and let the readers decide.\n\nYou purchased a powertrain control module for your 2006 Jeep Commander 5.7L at a very discounted price of $394.99, normally sold by our competitors at $750.00. All sold parts are fully tested and programmed, plug & play as our customers can attest to. We advised you from the begining to consult with a certified mechanic or dealaership to identify the issue when you first contacted us and stated that the vehicle drove perfectly for the more than two months since the purchase was delivered to you, before the vehicle suddenly started experiencing issues. Despite these facts we issued the warranty with no delay, and the second part was also fully programmed, plug & play as our routine procedure. The symptoms that you described with the first module after driving your vehicle for more than two months are the exact symptoms described after receiving the second unit, and it wasn't until then that you took the vehicle to be looked at by a certified mechanic or dealership as was recommended previously. The claim that the second part was not programmed is completely false, and as mentioned previously the issue was neither the parts nor the programming. We repeatedly asked you to provide the dealership report which you refused. We find your request of keeping a part that has fixed your vehicle while also being fully reimbursed the original sale price extremely absurd and against any business practice. The fact that you were offered to return the part for full refund proves how far our team tried to work with you."}<//response>

<Text>After 3 months of  trying to fix this Jeep Wrangler, using 3 PCMs from 2 other rebuilders, we FINALLY got the correct one from ARES Technologies.  We knew what the problem was  with all the other PCMs and ARES worked with us to bench test their unit and ensure it was good before they sent it.  Unlike the ones we'd gotten elsewhere, the one from ARES LOOKED like the original PCM, and SURE ENOUGH - when we plugged it in, it WORKED.  No muss no fuss.  It came properly packaged unlike the previous PCMs, AND it shipped the day after we ordered it and  got here in 2 days.  AND IT WAS CHEAPER THAN THE ONES THAT DIDN'T WORK!!!!! Overall, ARES gave us wonderful service and solved a problem our shop had been struggling with for 3 months and our customer is very happy with his Wrangler.</Text><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1605721251766, 'text': 'Dear Gary,\nIt is a pleasure to serve our customers.

Installed the ECM and my jeep seemed fine running at idle, but as soon as I drove it down the road, I smelled burning and it was worse then before. Even though the people were great and friendly, I would not buy from them again.< /text><time>1597503040315</time>< Gmap_id>

We are sad to hear that you may decide not to buy our products in the future and we hope you change your mind as we highly value our customers and hearing them leaving us is saddening for our team. For further confidence in our products, we have test vehicles in our facility for certain high demand modules which include but are not limited to the Jeep Wranglers with automatic and manual transmission.\n\nIn your specific case, since the original problem was having misfire, we always encourage our customers to consult with a professional mechanic or auto electrician to properly diagnose the issue (shortage in the wiring, bad coil, spark plugs, injectors, etc.) before replacing the PCM. If the underlying problem is not diagnosed and addressed properly, the replaced PCM is doomed to be damaged just as the original after driving for a short time.\n\nThank you again for your business and hope to hear back from you in the future.'}<//Response>

When contacting the company for a couple of questions, my emails were returned promptly and with a friendly and helpful tone to them.  Excellent experience!<//review>< userid>

<Text>Reputable company. Bought a plug and play ECM for a 2009 Saturn Aura for $130.00. Normally would have costed $400 plus having dealership program it for another $150.00. ECM has been installed for 2 months now and works as promised. I emailed ARES technology with a few questions and received a response within 2 hours after each email on a Sunday even. I was very impressed with the quick responses and knowledge. I definitely don't regret my purchase and would shop with them if needed. Thanks ARES Technology for the quality ECM!< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1602879299977, 'text': 'Dear Randy,\nIt is a pleasure to serve our customers.

< Review>
2000 dodge ram 1500 5.9L 4x4. Im a mechanic and was not able to find a junkyard computer for less then the price I paid for ECU. Identical part went right in place like it should have. worked great, great product and company to work with, had 2 days after ordering at the end of the first month of covid 19. And I appreciate the stickers they sent with. It was a nice topping to it all. Thanks< /Review>

Outstanding cusomer service and highly, commendable loyalty to customer's needs. I needed a PCM for my 2010 jeep wrangler and the folks at Ares Technologies was there at every step with quick turn-around and response and technical advice and help along the way.  They were very patient and dedicated to fixing my faulty PCM problem.  Highly recommended.<//Review>

<review>I had been trying to get the TCU for my 04 Rubicon for almost a year, started out sending the original off for rebuild, it came back not rebuildable. and the company did not have a replacement.  I searched for several weeks for another supplier, was actually told by the Napa Dealer that the only place in the country that could rebuild them was Cardone in New Jersey.  So did not have much hope, I found a place online in Florida that said he had one on the shelf ready to go and it could be mine for $900.00, I told him to keep it.  I was referred to Flagship One in New York by the local Jeep Dealer.  So I contacted them, they had one on the shelf ready to ship,  would ship in 3-5 days, after a week of waiting I contacted them and I was told it was in programming and would ship soon.  This went on for 11 weeks. By chance I found ARES Technologies, I called and of course with everything I had been through over the past year I was skeptical when I was told they had one, plug and play ready, and it would ship the following morning.  I gave the young lady the fifth degree, until I was pretty sure I was not being taken advantage of. So I placed the order and BAM! there it was 3 days later.  Unfortunately (no fault on Ares Part) I installed the part the same day, started it up and 0 Oil pressure. I had to have it towed to the shop and have it checked out. Evidently because it had sat for a Year while trying to find this part the Oil Pump lost prime, so I ended up having a new oil pump installed. I picked it up from the shop and have been driving it ever since.  Oh and the best part is, I got the part for less than what I had paid at Flagship One.
THANK YOU  ARES TECHNOLOGIES FOR YOUR OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE.  I have contacted that JEEP dealership and told them not to ever send anyone to FS1 anymore but to Make sure that they Send their customers to ARES Technologies.<//review>< Pictures>

<Response>{'time': 1594997383632, 'text': "Our dear customer,\nWe are sorry to hear that you were not satisfied with our service. Here at ARES Technologies we prioritize our customers' needs but we also have certain policies to follow and would like our customers to respect what we have agreed upon. We would like to use this opportunity to explain what occured and hope it clarifies your concern.\n1. The cost of purchasing the module and having it flashed at a delaership would exceed $500, you purchased the module at about a $100 and we provided the key relearn instruction to have your car started.\n2. The crankshaft relearn requirement after swapping the PCM is based on GM engineering design and it is beyond our control. In certain cars manufactured by GM company you need to perform this relearn to make your new PCM aware of the position of the crankshaft sensor. It is a 5 second process and needs to be done by a scan tool.\n3. The fact that your local dealership decided to charge you $100 for a 5 second relearn process is beyond our control. That's why we always encourage our customers to consult with a local mechanic or auto electrician before taking their cars to a dealership.\n4. We accepted your request to return the part and we didn't charge you any restocking fee as we are the only business in this industry that won't charge our customers any form of restocking or programming fee for the first 30 days after purchasing the module.\n5. Our return policy in our website clearly states that it is the customer's responsibility to return the part if they decide to do that for any reason.\nWe wish you the best and have a great day!"}< /Response>< name>

This company is legit.  Mt first package got lost.  The tracking showed it was settinf in California somewhere.  But didnt move for a few days.   This company sent a new order usps priority so i had my ecu on time.  Because the tracking didnt move, completely not thier fault, they replaced my order very quickly !!!!!   Wish i could leave 10 🌟's.  Would recommend them to anyone.< /text>

Our record shows that you have placed your order on May 10th and received it two days after on May 12th which I believe is a very good time frame to program a module and deliver it to your address. After that, you never contacted us regarding your purchase.

It's a nice park, it has a lot of cool modern equipment and is typically busy. There is a lot of room for hyper kids like mine to run around or ride their scooters.<//text>

The remake is so much fun for both kids and I have a two year old and a 14 year old we love how close it is ..if they would just open the bathrooms it would be perfect !!!! Love the different types of swings and the zip line was a great new addition just be careful not to hit the top 🤣< /text>

Always clean and well maintained. Next to an fire station, and many houses... doesnt have the problem other local parks do of being overrun with bums. Play place is fenced and gated and great for toddlers</Text>

<Text>This place has pastries.

Tried both the pumpkin and red bean with mochi pastries. The pumpkin was fresh made, not canned and not like pumpkin pie but like kombucha--a light sweetness.

The red bean with mochi filling was very sweet, in a good way, with a wonderful, glutinous mouthfeel.

Also came for their thick and thin green onion pancakes. Both are good--the thin ones are more about the crispy texture, the thick ones are more about the green onions flavor.

The show stoppers were the pork belly bun and their green leek pastry which was a giant empanada stuffed with green onions, vermicelli, egg, and ground meat. Yum!<//Text>< pics>

<pics>None</pics><review>A home style dishes restaurant with a Taiwanese flavor in their cooking. And on Saturday they have a special breakfast menu that features soy milk, both sweet and salty versions, green onion pancakes, egg biscuits, beef biscuits, xiaolungbao, among others. The only place in Torrance with this offering.<//review>< user>

<Text>Peter's Place is a traditional Taiwanese restaurant which offers a variety of dishes. The prices are reasonable and the portions are quite generous, too. It is perhaps one of the most authentic Chinese/Taiwanese restaurants in the South Bay area, that is why it is a rarity.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80dd4af3cd96f8b9:0xc9175a0074da5903</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>I love eating at Pete's place. The food is great and the service is exceptional. I have been there many times since I found them and have never, ever had a bad experience. One thing to note, they are closed for a couple of hours after lunch, best check before going.< /text><Rate>5</Rate></record></dataset><record>

The food is always great, especially the fried fish.  Also they greet you as part of the family.  This is our weekly outing for the past two years.</text>

I took the kids for Saturday breakfast.  We used to get soy milk, egg pancake, rice roll in OC from 99 Ranch and this seems to be the only place to get soy milk for breakfast.

We were disappointed in the experience.  The soy milk tasted diluted, both the hot and cold one.  My 5 year old's comment is 'this tastes like water'.

The fried dough inside the rice roll was pretty tough instead of crunchy.  The egg pancake was good, the texture is more doughy than normal.

We came here for dinner awhile back, similar luke warm impression on food.  The restaurant is very cluttered, and as expected of old restaurant, you wondee about cleaniness.

The servers are nice, but when there are more than 3 tables, they seem to get overwhelm and get anxious at each other.<//Text>

<Text>Service is pretty amazing! The bartender was friendly and accommodating to our group of 8. He checked on us periodically to see how we were doing. He made me a delicious Bloody Mary with a Tajin rim- had not tried it that way before! Simply delicious! He aimed to please! Such great customer service. I also had their taquitos- super tasty! Can't wait to go back! Their prices are great, too!!<//Text>< Resp>

<Text>Last week was the first time we visited this fine restaurant. But It is surely not the last time. We enjoyed the evening very much with the excellent service, with the finest  dishes and booze and with the decent charge. We will definitely return there in a short time.< /Text><date>1580939194217<//date><Rate>5</Rate>< name>

<Text>Taco Tuesdays is lit!! Fridays and Saturdays are always packed after ten so early arrival is suggested. No cover most nights and No dress Code. No team hats or jerseys but other then that anything goes. Drinks are priced a lil high if you are into liquor. The bartenders here are all very friendly and fast.<//Text><resp>None</resp><rate>5</rate>< name>

Would give this place no stars came here with my husband and they did not let him in because he had a face tattoo yet they let a girl with a face tattoo in. My husband's tattoo wasent even gang related or anything it said loyalty. So if you have tattoos expect to not be let in! We are in 2019 tattoos arnt a big deal</text>

My husband did plenty of research on the type of mattress we wanted for our rental property. We went to several other places but Damon’s knowledge and professionalism sealed the deal! We truly appreciate how he listened and accommodated our needs. We highly recommend Sleepy Mattress and will be sending our family, friends, and real estate clients to Damon. Thanks again!!</Text>

I recently purchased a king sized mattress from Sleepy Mattress.  Competitive prices and excellent customer service. Don’t let the small store front fool you, they can order any model at great prices. The small showroom help keep their prices low. Ordering was fast and delivery was punctual. I would definitely recommend to my friends and family.<//text>

I would highly recommend Sleepy Mattress Warehouse to ANYONE looking for a mattress. I set an appointment with Nellie to go in and pick a mattress. She had set out 3 mattresses I would like. Within 5 minutes she had put me on a mattress I loved. I walked out of there feeling great considering I got a fantastic deal, found a perfect mattress, and did it all in under 10 minutes!</Review>

<Review>I had such a wonderful experience at Sleepy Mattress Warehouse. I had been out shopping all day looking for the perfect mattress for my little princess who is 5 and wanted her own “big girl bed”. At the end of a long search, I came to Sleepy Mattress and was quickly aided in my search. Not only did I find a better quality  mattress, they even went one step further and price matched it at a competitive rate AND delivered it SAME DAY! I will definitely be going back and referring to my family and friends! Thank you Sleepy mattress!< /Review>< Name>

We were in need of a new bed and dreaded mattresses shopping.  I looked online for mattress store reviews.  I came across Sleepy Mattress Warehouse. Never heard of it but all the reviews were outstanding.  I could see they carried what we were looking for so I went to the website and saw that it was by appointment only.  I had never heard of that for a mattress shop but was intrigued.  I loved the chat option on the website.  I was able to chat with Damon to set up the appointment for the same day.  We went later that day and have to say we were both incredibly impressed by Damon’s knowledge and service.  He was so helpful in going over our options, not trying to over or up sell us but go over exactly what we needed.  Damon went over the prices and offered an exceptional price.  We actually ended up getting a new guest bed as well because the selection and prices could not be beat.  Thank you Damon for making what we were dreading a truly enjoyable and rewarding experience!  Cheers!<//Text>

I wasn’t aware that they are by appointment only but they still let me in since there was no appointment scheduled at that time. Damon gave me recommendations based on my price range and mattress preference and after about 30-40 minutes I made a purchase! They also do free delivery if you are within a certain driving distance (can’t remember the details). Overall, the whole process was very smooth and simple and the price was very reasonable as well! Would definitely recommend this place.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1566216563145, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to leave your feedback.

Great deal on a bed!

Delivery price was reasonable!

Very convenient and satisfying purchase. Set up an appointment for an hour later, made a purchase within the next hour (great prices, great products), and best thing yet - SAME-DAY DELIVERY, granted we were near, but still impressive. They also match Amazon prices on mattress protectors so it saves you the “hassle” of two-day shipping.

I bought a hybrid (memory foam & coil) mattress, but I liked how he offered to customize mattresses with a cheaper base + gel-memory foam/latex topper to create your ideal mattress (we wanted something firm but with a soft top). He tries to sell you what you need, wonderful customer service. Prices were fair and you can try the mattresses without resorting to purchasing online.

Finally, I’d like to emphasize again: SAME-DAY DELIVERY if you are near.< /Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Sleepy Mattress in Mission Viejo was the absolute best experience in buying a mattress ever. Damon is amazing, from the showroom experience to the customer service, everything was first class. We were able to shop at the private showroom and try out all the beds. Damon is very knowledgeable and was able to help us find the mattress that worked best for us. Sleepy Mattress beat Sit n Sleep’s price and I had my mattress the same day. I also purchased a mattress protector and awesome gel pillows to make our bed perfect. I will be back to purchase again for my kids when they need a new mattress. Thank You Damon!< /Review>< Pics>

Such a great customer focused process. A total pleasure dealing with Damon and Natalie. Private showing at 10am, no pressure on the sale, just good selection and prices, and since my choice was in stock it was delivered by 1pm. Can't recommend them enough for your next mattress purchase.</review>

I will start by saying I have never written a review before today. But I woke up this morning from an amazing night sleep in my new bed and had to share it.  Damon really hooked me up yesterday.  I moved to Irvine this weekend and I needed a new mattress but didn't wan to pay thousands. I went to a couple places before I found Sleepy Mattress online.  I got a great price on new everything - mattress, sheets, protector and the pillows - these pillows are amazing! They even had it delivered a couple hrs later. I saved a ton of time and money with this place.  Absolutely recommend it.<//Review>

Great concept!!! They have a simple, very clean showroom (low overhead). No pushy sales people. I went to 4 other stores before finding this place. They have great prices with a great product and same day delivery. There is no reason to go anywhere else.< /Review>

<Text>Damon is so helpful and backs his products. We just bought our 2nd mattress from him today. There is a big enough selection to give choices without being too many and overwhelming. He offers the best sellers of each category so the options are consumer popular as well as being from reputable companies. We have recommended this company to several family members who are looking for mattresses, we hope they choose this company over more traditional, expensive options that don't back their products.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80dce90f56e7d887:0x8650f8f5e7ae5cf3< /Gmap_id></record>

I got to say, I was looking for a mattress of great quality without spending too much. I found sleepy mattress through a coworker and made an appointment same day. When I got got there, I explained to Damon what the type of bed I was looking for is and my budget. He kindly showed me a few choices in the showroom which was simple and quiet. Not crowned or clustered like some stores. I found the perfect mattress and didn't want to get off of it. Thanks to Damons prices and payment plans, I sleep on it now and I honestly have a amazing improvement in sleep/life quality. Thank you!!<//Review>

While picking out the mattress we were given great assistance and met with much patience during the process. Later, the matresss was delivered to my apartment while I was moving in and the company was very punctual in doing so and extremely helpful, as they even brought the mattress inside for us. The efficiency, wonderful assistance, and patience that the company delivered is very much appreciated. Thank you.< /Review>

Honestly, there has never been a better or easier way to buy a mattress then thru Sleepy Town Mattress. From the very beginning, you are greeted by the owner, Damon (who is very attentive and courteous with his online chat feature - kudos!!!) who patiently walks you thru the entire experience and makes sure you understand the details about each mattress and why it would be a good fit. We must have been there for over an hour; and, when all was said and done, the deal we received was exceptional! The delivery process could not have been easier and we're very happy with our decision. Thanks so much Damon for providing outstanding customer service!</Text>

< review>
I couldn't have had a better experience. I was sleeping like a baby on my new mattress the same day I came in. It was so easy to set up an appointment, and the customer service was top notch. I was able to find a mattress that I absolutely love at a much better price than any else around. If you are looking for a mattress, you owe it to yourself to check this place out, you just can't beat the prices for the quality. Talk to Damon and get your sleep on fleek like me ;)</review>

Sleepy Mattress is definitely the place to go if you’re looking for high quality mattresses at really great prices (i.e. Simmons). Best of all, the you get the entire showroom to yourself! Damon is friendly, understanding, and informative. He goes the extra mile to make sure you’ll have a pleasant buying experience.

If you live or work in OC, make sure to come by this store. You won’t be disappointed!<//Review><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1526067475089, 'text': 'Thank you S Matt for the 5 star review! Sleep Well my friend. ;)'}<//response>< Gmap_id>

What a great mattress shoping experience! I wasnt even planning to purchase a new mattress yet but thought I would stop in to see what they had. Nellie was very helpful and i never felt pressure to buy. She suggested several mattresses based on my sleeping habits and we got it down to one that was my favorite. She then had me google the mattress i picked out to find the lowest online price which was a couple hundred more than the Sleepy Mattress price! Needless to say i ended up purchasing a new mattress for a great price and excellent customer service. Nellie is great to work with and she actually started out as a customer of Sleepy mattress and then started working there! I think thats really cool. I would defintley recommend this place to anyone looking for a great deal and pressure free buying experience.<//text>

<Text>Great place to shop for mattresses!
My husband and I were looking for a mattress to replace the Tempurpedic we had.  He picked this place for us to check out based on the reviews from other websites.  The first time we walked in, Damon treated us great.  After all, he likes to work with appointments so his attention is fully dedicated to the customers (and not other customers who could interrupt the experience).

Damon told us he only sells BeautyRest Platinum and Silver (plus another local brand).  I was set to get a BeautyRest Black because of reviews from friends on this type of mattress.  But after a few questions, Damon knew what type of mattresses we were interested and showed us the best option.  A good thing is that Damon gets to try these mattresses so he can speak from personal experience.

After we left, we visited other locations, from department stores to chain stores, but their prices wouldn't match what Sleepy Mattress Warehouse offered.  So we went back a second time.  We decided to go for another mattress option (extra firm mattress), bought the adjustable models, AND we even bought a second mattress for the guest bedroom.

If you are looking for a quality mattress and the best prices, you have to go to Sleepy Mattress Warehouse.  Damon will treat you great and he will honestly give you his opinion.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1570112699625, 'text': 'Thank you for leaving your review for our business.'}<//response>< GmapID>

I called the number I found for him on craigslist and he was ready to meet with me in 10 minutes and on the phone he said he would be able to get me my mattress the same night. (which he did).  He kept his word and didn't try to upsell me at all. He was honestly concerned with me getting the best bed that worked for me at a reasonable price. The beds he is selling are the same beds that sit n sleep,  OC Mattress, and all those other big mattress stores are selling. The only difference is that he runs his own business and doesn't have a whole bunch of sales people working for him that are trying to make commission off of you. He also sells mattress protectors that cost $100 at sit n sleep and OC Mattress and he sells them for $50. I just met him on Sunday and I will definitely be referring all my friends and family to Damon. He also carries the same warranties that those other big rip off companies provide, cause he gets his mattresses from the same people. If you are looking for a bargain and to help out a family owned business opposed to a big money sucking corporations; Sleepy Mattress and Furniture Warehouse is the place to go. He is open 7 days a week 9am-9pm and from the service he gave me last night, I honestly think that he would meet anyone at anytime. Thanks Damon!!</text>< time>

very unprofessional company... yea their mattresses are a tad cheaper; but you get what you pay for!  Never dealt with a more childish "owner"... if that really is the owner... hard to believe theyre still in business</Review>

<Review>Venus Cafe hits the spot when I am craving Hong Kong / Cantonese food in the South Bay Area / San Jose! It has your staple HK diner items, and of course your breakfast and afternoon cha chaan teng go-to's. My favorite item is the baked spaghetti dishes - very cozy and comforting. The portions are generous. Please go support Chinese restaurants, especially during Covid!<//Review>< Pictures>

Venus cafe has good HK cafe style food. We had the white sauce fried rice and hainan dish. Food was pretty good. The owner or host was very helpful and kind during this difficult corona period. Will be back again.<//Text>

Went there during their afternoon tea special. Lot of choice about $8 each. Come with milk tea or coffee.  We had the black pepper chicken baked rice, chicken is juicy and the black pepper sauce is nice not spicy at all. The combination noodles is really good. So far the best 车仔面ever. Milk tea is Hong Kong style, so it’s abit strong. We can’t sleep at night<//text>

The Food
One of the more decent Hong Kong style cafe around south bay area is Venus Cafe. I had a few of their dishes like their Signature Baked Item and Guilin Rice Noodle Soup, as well as Dessert. This time around I got their Seafood Combo Guilin Rice Noodle Soup. I've also had their Beef Brisket Guilin Rice Noodle Soup. Both were very good, and I especially like the noodles. The Seafood Combo comes with fish, squid, and shrimp, with a nice touch of peanut and pickled veggie.

The Miscellaneous
Venus Cafe is within a plaza with a decent sized parking lot. The restaurant itself is average in size, but the seatings are well arranged. The service is normal, and the employees are quite quick and efficient. One thing I like about the restaurant is their menu. They have quite the extensive menu with lots of selections. But the menu itself is also designed well. The price of all their dishes are fairly reasonable. Will return again sometime to eat more of their menu...a good place to visit.<//text>

<review>I missed this place when it was in Cupertino. I drove an hour in traffic to come here.

Milktea - it's the next best thing from having it in HK

Shrimp paste beef fried rice - like every restaurant, they need to put not shrimp paste in it.  It'll make a huge difference.

Black pepper pork chop fried instant noodles in an iron skillet - my son's favorite, I had a bite and it was very good.  Enough black pepper flavor, noodle was dry. It was really good.

My special pork chop baked over rice was good but I didn't like the white sauce, it taste starchy. The red sauce was good.  You can actually request all red sauce.  The difference of this pork chop is that it's deep fried pork cutlet not the regular pork chop.

This is definitely the place to be for reminiscent HK comfort food.</review><Time>1575434790675< /Time></record>

Open during the lock down.

"Hong Kong style cafe"... interesting if not confusing mix of Eastern and Western dishes / flavors. I've tried the "Big Brother", Beef Chow Mien, Bolognese w/ Raw Egg w/ Rice. The overall dishes weren't anything to write home about but they were all were hardy and satisfying.</Review>

Awesome experience to try Hong Kong cuisine that blends both Eastern and Western elements. For those not from Hong Kong, I got spaghetti, pork chop, a chicken wing and an egg. Each item sounds like American food yet it still had an Asian flavor somehow.

The other dish is more of a hybrid. American Macaroni and ham (or is this British) in ramen broth.

The $25 limit to use a credit card seemed a bit high if you have a party of two or fewer ("fewer" of course being just me wandering in by myself). I was expecting a $20 limit. Either way, I'm looking forward to going back to try more dishes.</review>

This place is great for comfort food for those days you want to be a bum on the couch and relax. I love getting the big brother. Which consists of fried chicken fried pork chop with rice covered in red sauce and white sauce on the other side. So good but very heavy. Maybe share it. Hahaha. NVM. Just do it!< /text>

This would be my go-to HK cafe in San Jose! It's kind of far but I try to go whenever I'm close. It's located in the plaza with 99 Ranch and Gen, and most of the time it's really hard to find parking.

There are not that many good HK cafes in SJ so I really recommend trying Venus! I usually get either their pork chop with spaghetti & bolognaise sauce OR their seafood stir-fried udon (my favorite!!) it's always so good everytime I come. I also love, love, love HK desserts!! I would always get their sago desserts, with their different kinds of fruits. The fruits are always fresh, the dessert isn't too sweet, definitely satisfies my meal there.</review>

<review>The food in the cafe has been improved. I ordered a wonton soup noodle and a shanghai thick noodle in soup on the last saturday. They were good and tasty not salty like before. They were smaller in portion compare to the past. The price was ok but parking was terrible in lunch hours.</review><Pics>None</Pics></record>

Their lunch portions are generous so it's a great work lunch option for those working in the area! I enjoyed their black pepper pork lunch. Their black pepper sauce is delicious, definitely my type of flavour, and they were generous enough to give me extra sauce when I asked for it. Other than that, they seem pretty solid for an HK place.<//text>

Tried the congee and the clay pot beef, and both were definitely way more flavorful and satisfying than your standard Asian cafe fare. Servings are huge, so there was plenty left to take home. What I've tried so far gives me hope that the rest of their menu can be as good. Will be coming back!<//Review>

HK comfort food, large menu. Food is usually p good and large portion for what you pay. +1 star bc their HK milk tea is legit! I also love their happy hour (after 9 pm) specials. The mini dishes are a good size and cheap!</review>

Excellent place for simple Hong Kong style cafe food.  One of the best in the south bay.  Look for the special menu written in the board next to the counter.<//Review>

A favorite spot for comfort food. Milk tea is always great and I recommend the club sandwich.< /text>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>I cometely forgot to take pictures, but we love the food here. We have been here several times and they do not dissappoint. I always tend to order their congee because its authentic and has delicious taste with just the right amount of ingredients, plus they have the best consistency to the heartiness of the congee. Oh and their other dishes also have good taste! This place is definitely worth a try!< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

True HK dishes and large portions.  Lunch has a variety of options plus tomato soup, bread, and coffee/milk tea.< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>I have been here many times. They have been around for a number of years. They specialized in Hong Kong fast food. And I think they have done a decent job at it. For those who aren't familiar with HK fast food, it's usually a lot of carbs, fast to make or already made, and is heavily influenced by the West while maintaining the Chinese characteristics. The combination of cooking style provides a very unique experience. But don't expect it to be healthy. If you grew up with it, it's comfort food. If you are new to it, it will be an acquired taste.

Pros:
1. Open very late. Great place to get food after 10 PM.
2. A lot of variety.
3. Decent Asian dessert selection.
4. A Chinese place that has cheese dishes, and I don't mean grilled cheese.
4. Very reasonable price.
5. There is a decent size parking lot in front of it.
6. In the same strip mall as Ranch 99, you can do your grocery shopping before or after your dining experience.

Cons:
1. Mostly carb based plates.
2. A lot of greasy plates as well.
3. Parking lot is always full, hard to get parking.

If you are new to this style of places, it will give you a very unique experience. If you miss your HK fast food/street food experience, this is a good place to satisfy your craving.

The missing star is the service. The overall service is decent. But when you asked if they have any other vegetables, the usually reply is "we got everything except veggie x." Their menu only have 1 dish with green leaf veggie in it and it's the bak choy. So getting that kind of reply doesn't really help much as I was checking to see if there are different green leaf veggie dishes. It would be much helpful if they can at least provide some green leaf dish's names. Or recommend something.</Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

<Text>Food is underwhelming. Baked cheese rice wasn't baked and instead of cheese was mostly milk cream.
Parking is very hard to find and had a bad experience where another car  just cut right in front of me to get the space I waited for very long.<//Text></record>

They have such a big beautiful Park right next to the dog park that they have such beautiful grass in, would be nice to have some in the dog park. But then again when I first drove up I saw the big Macy tractor and thought it was actually in the dog park!!! And then when I saw it really wasn't maybe I was just overly disappointed? But it would have been cool if they had had an old tractor in the dog park. That with all the building going on in this area and all the new homeowners moving in you would think they would want to have something to draw more people to this area. But that's just my opinion. I did notice though that there were tennis balls, a big box of tennis balls oh, just sitting open late out in front of the entry Gates? And then once I got inside the park I realized they must have a problem with people stealing things because they certainly used a big chain on that back gate, I wonder if people were sneaking in the back gate so that they could go easily through the front gate and get a tennis ball? Government work is good if you can get it, but it was no dog honor that designed this park<//Text>

Animals and their owners seemed very relaxed and happy.  There is a small section for small dogs & a larger section for large dogs.  The  rest of the park is family friendly!< /Review>

I belong to TOPS which is a weight loss group. We meet here at the park because we can't meet at our regular place, due to the Covid 19 stuff. We wear our mask's and keep our distance for safety. But we get to weigh in on a portable scale, & have our meetings and keep on track of our progress. And enjoy the company of our group.<//Review>

<Text>Very nice dog park. Areas for big and small dogs. Shaded, water, bags, seats . Some chairs brought in by the users of the park. There is a group that gets together at 8 am for playtime.  Everyone seems very friendly and responsible for the pups.</Text></record>

Pretty decent park, the only problem is people are not picking up the poop. Now I believe in my opinion if you have the bags & trash can inside the gate of each dog run it will get picked up more. Some people have issues walking out of the gate to get bags and then out again to throw it. Just a suggestion being that's the way other parks are.< /review>

<review>When we visited there wasn't any other dogs in the dog section.  The dog portion is split for large and small dogs.  There are some built in toys on each side.  The double gate on the large dog side did not function correctly on the interior gate, so watch as you enter with your loved ones.  There is a dog water bowl available.  However, in the people aspect the water and bathrooms are on the opposite end of park near parking lot.  For a small park in a neighborhood it is fairly well kept.<//review>< Pics>

The park is nice, but there is no more dog park. It was torn out for the sports area. They have plans to build a new one but there is no time frame.<//Text>

<Review>Just brought my three rotties there. They played solo in one fenced area. I leashed em and as I was walking back to my jeep three giant great Danes rushed me. So I let my friendly one go play and put the old one and the frisky one in the car. She was playing and sniffing while I watched from 3 feet away. When a tall bald guy with a white beard starts kicking Gabby. He said I don't know whos dog this is but" " mine stop kicking her". You didn't see what I saw he said. I said I was standing right there. Nothing happened. He then goes to threaten me by saying that "Oh you'd know trust me". Cause she's a rottweiler?..I ask.. he mumbles and I walk away with Gabby.
Horrid, horrible place full of mean, angry, racist, breedist, nasty people that will kick your dog.
I hope this park gets turned into pavement.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80dc9ddac46317c3:0x7303f9f7065ee763< /gmap_id></record>

This is the first time I get to leave a positive review because I was so impressed with the help I got here. The customer service was knowledgeable and helpful. I think they should get a raise.<//Text>

They have been working really hard to make it nicer. They're painting each room keeping the place really clean. Not alot of people hanging out up to no good. Not the best location but the workers work hard to make it a good environment. Very impressed by all the improvements.</review>

Dirty rooms. They need to have a better cleaning system. The guy at the check in laughed when I asked for a 2 bed room. When I got to the room it looked nice at first but then we started to find cockroaches and bugs. And their was a funky smell. Never going back</text>

Clean, Semi Updated rooms. Management and Staff are VERY friendly  and try their best to accommodate your needs. Located at the South end of 9th street, but once your settled in, your location is easily forgotten.<//text>

<text>I stayed there from 02/06/18 till 02/17/18 with children, The Location Seems Bad But They Definitely Keep All The Bad Out Of Their Motel! The Room's are Very Clean & Nice They Have A Housekeeper That Kick's A** On Cleaning Room's. Disregard Any Bad Reviews it's Quiet,Clean, safe parking and Great Management All the way around it's A Good Motel!!</text><Date>1518926398477< /Date><Pictures>None<//Pictures><userid>104636370563613232509</userid>< rate>

Called to see what the latest check in time was. The Indian woman who answered didn’t specify I had even reached the hotel and continued to tell me 3 even though that is the earliest check in. When a younger boy came on the phone he told me I might not get a room if they were booked even though I was asking about a future time. When I asked him the same question he told me 3 or before midnight.
Both people were rude and seemed disinterested to customers on the phone. Definitely not booking</text>

<text>Location was close to car and train noise. There was also noise from construction in the room next to mine. The mattress and curtains were torn, and we found two notes scrawled with permanent markers in drawers. We also found and killed a cockroach in the room during our one night stay. For some reason the heater was at full blast and the tub was half filled with hot water that was still running when we first entered after booking our room?? This made our room hot and muggy and it took a while to air out to a comfortable temperature. The main office was locked and it took a while to get service after ringing the door bell. The bed was somewhat comfortable and the price wasn't terrible, but those are the only somewhat positive things i can say about our stay.< /text><response>None<//response>< time>

RD' This establishment reminds me of home. It gave me an Ocean Front experience that I can memorised for life, which helps me remember hot sand roaming through my feet' falling right through my toes.  I am able to build  a Mastermind' after staying in that room, slash `Available Bossen' luxury arrangements.<//text>

Horrible location. The recent upgrades to the room left everything with a layer of dust. People were drying their laundry outside. Close to I5 and train tracks. The room upgrades were nice but with so many negatives I would stay away especially since this is not the cheapest hotel stay in modesto.</Text>

The man at the front desk was run and had a attuned. I couldn't get comfortable or even sleep because kids where  running around in the hallways and people yelling around all night long. When I went to check out they started  Accusing me of having people in my room when I never had anybody coming over and I was from out of town so idk anyone in that city or near it but it was their way trying to keep my deposit but I did get it back. I will never say here again and I will never reccomend it to anyone. They made motel 6 look way better haha<//Text>

I would not recommend staying here. It may be cheap, but it's clear to see why. It's In a really shady area, the floor inside was filthy, the roof in the bathroom was leaking so it kept flooding, there was no remote for the tv and when we finally got one, only like 3 buttons worked. Both lightbubls were missing by the bed, no cleaning, awful service, there was AWFUL construction in the room right next door. There was banging, drilling,  pounding! It was so loud. THIS IS THE WORST PLACE I HAVE STAYED AT EVER</text>

I was reluctant due to the part of town it's located at, however, it's very quiet, clean and the pictures online matched the actual room condition which is nice. Would give 5 stars if wi-fi was a direct connection rather than a slow hot spot.< /Review>

<Text>You get what you pay for. Front desk gave the wrong spelling of WiFi password, had to walk to desk to ask for it again. Hot water is slightly slow.

< Review>
This Hotel was Nice, Clean and Quiet my only complaint was that there wasn't any stores or food places close enough. I tried to order Pizza Hutt but they said they didn't deliver to Hotels but that's not your fault but otherwise I Enjoyed my Stay Thank You!!<//Review>

Took ten minutes for the water to run hot, cigarette burns in the sheets, absolutely FILTHY bathroom (torn curtain, hair in the tub, slow drain, moldy calking peeling off), someone was sleeping in their broken down car in the parking lot with a baby, no pillow cases, wifi didn't work, "free breakfast" is a lie, terribly uncomfortable mattress, rough scratchy blankets, only one tiny towel, a sheriff came knocking on doors in the middle of the night for a "safety check" (I'm not even kidding), super unfriendly "front desk" guy who checked us in an undershirt and socks.

At first when we got there omg I saw location and I thought it doesn't look very nice. I still had to get ready for my friends wedding and they were kind enough to let us check in three hours early but once we got inside it wasn't bad. I thought geez it's clean and it's not brand new or anything but as long is it's clean. TV and wifi, refrigerator and microwave. Price very reasonable. I guess it's true don't judge book by its cover</text>

<review>(Translated by Google) Structure with private parking, nice room with refrigerator, microwave ... These are the only positive aspects.
Unfortunately the area is not absolutely recommended.
Outside the hotel there was a prostitution area (also seen inside the structure).
People checking what you have in the car.
At night, cars with loud music, shouting, shouting, crying. Impossible to sleep.
The window with the mosquito net was practically open and could not be blocked.
At night you could hear the trains passing and whistling at every step.
To access the reception, locked, you had to ring the bell and wait.
No premises nearby.
To avoid!

(Original)
Struttura con parcheggio privato, bella stanza con frigorifero, microonde… Questi gli unici aspetti positivi.
Purtroppo la zona non è assolutamente consigliabile.
Fuori dalla struttura c'era una zona di prostituzione (viste anche all'interno della struttura).
Gente che controlla cosa hai nella macchina.
Di notte, macchine con musica ad alto volume, grida, schiamazzi, pianti. Impossibile dormire.
La finestra con la zanzariera era praticamente aperta e non si poteva bloccare.
Di notte si potevano udire i treni che passavano e fischiavano ad ogni passaggio.
Per accedere alla reception, chiusa a chiave, bisognava suonare il campanello ed aspettare.
Nessun locale nelle vicinanze.
Da evitare!<//review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) I arrived tired just wanting to sleep and shower, there was no hot water, the phone did not work, I went to the reception and gave me another key to use the shower from another room, I wanted to charge $ 20 for it or if I missed from there or called the police, THREATEN THE CUSTOMERS !!! I refused to pay and told him to call the police if he wanted to ... When I woke up I saw my new car scratched with evil, they were without a doubt, I told them I wanted the security camera recordings and the guy refused with absurd excuses .... A SITE WASTE, MISTRACT THE CUSTOMER.

(Original)
Llegué cansado simplemente con ganas de dormir y ducharme, no habia agua caliente, el teléfono no funcionaba, me dirigí a la recepción y me dio otra llave para utilizar la ducha de otra habitación, me quiso COBRAR 20$ por ello o si no me echaba de alli o llamaba a la policía, AMENAZAN A LOS CLIENTES!!! me negué a pagar y dije q llamara a la policía si queria... Al despertar vi mi carro nuevo  arañado a maldad, fueron ellos sin duda, les dije q queria las grabaciones de la cámara de seguridad y el tipo se negó con excusas absurdas.... UNA BASURA DE SITIO, MALTRATAN AL CLIENTE.</Text>

(Translated by Google) The food is delicious, the owner has terrible service. Mr. is much friendlier and more helpful. Unfortunately it is already several times that I have had bad experiences with those mrs. And that's why we hardly eat there when she is there.

La comida esta deliciosa, la dueña tiene pesimo servicio. El sr es mucho mas amable y servicial. Desafortunadamente ya son varias veces que eh tenido malas experiencias con esas sra. Y por eso casi no comemos ahi cuando esta ella.< /review>

Pumps keep disconnecting early for some reason. Makes it difficult to know if you're full or the pump just jumped. Have left not full multiple times as a result. Also staff is not great at managing traffic. There might be a mostly empty pump and then a pump with a huge line and some staff members help distribute, others just chill there, letting the traffic build up, not doing anything, with a mostly empty set of pumps which the traffic can't see. Frustrating to watch. But prices are good. Wait times can be long ...in part due to the bad pumps and lazy employees (Some! Some are doing a great job managing traffic)< /text>

This Costco gas station gets crowded in the middle of the day and late afternoon (like any Costco gas station). Expect to wait about 10-15 mins before reaching the pump. Otherwise it's clean and the prices are hard to beat. They provide two choice for grade: regular or premium. You need a membership to purchase gas here.<//text>

If you don't have a Cost Co card, your wasting money. Gasoline is going up but CostCo offers some of the best savings. These savings off set the membership fee and you come out a winner. I bought a computer at a savings of over $200.00 the membership fee is $50.00 they pay you at the end of the year a percentage of your purchases. So you get the savings and money back, win win.< /Text>

<text>Oh boy is the line long. You have have wait a long time at peak hours. Although the prices are cheap, it's not very good gas because my gas mileage isn't the most efficient. I recommend safeway gas. Little to no line and my cars gas mpg is high after filling up.</text>< Pictures>

I recently decided to start getting gas here. The lines can be long at times but they do move along pretty quickly if the person at the pump knows what they're doing. 😅 not everyone does and it just holds up everything. I really do like that the employees are constantly monitoring the pumps to help the people who don't know what their doing as well as preventing skimmers to be placed<//Text>

Quality gas is the cheapest. Lines move fast because they are organized.  They wipe the pumps down after each use.

This is a great place to stop on the way up to Tahoe to fuel up before you get stuck in traffic on the way up to go skiing. This place is crazy crowded and I am surprised they have not installed an extra set of pumps for all the islands. Our Costco at home has doubled up the number of pumps making the lines go that much faster.
I will keep coming back here because it’s very convenient and close to the freeway on the way up to Tahoe but it does not make for a pleasant stop over. There is a Starbucks in the same shopping center so it helps to stop there as well for a bite to eat and a little caffeine.<//Text>

Best place to get the best price on gas. Even on Maui , gas was way less expensive than other places. Being a Costco member is great, but being able to get top quality gas at the lowest price in town is phenomenal  !!!<//text>

<text>I probably shouldn't spill the beans on this, but if you go before 8:45 AM on a weekday, there's virtually never a line, since everyone seems to stop in the evening on their way home from work leaving downtown. I run through Quick Quack (conveniently located in the same parking lot!) for a car wash, and then Costco for gas, every Tuesday morning. Super easy and fast!!<//text>< Response>

Best price of gas at the moment. I dont think you can find anywhere cheaper in Sacramento area.
We drive a bmw X3, always go for the premium gas and it works great so far.< /Review>

They recently started accepting credit cards! Long hoses allow filling up from either side of the vehicle. An attendant is available during regular business hours to help and will pump gas for those that have disabilities. I think the lines have been a little shorter since they remodeled the lot and put in the Quick Quack, but it's difficult to determine the long-term effects.<//Review><UserId.>109744494874869184826< /UserId.>< pics>

Cheap gas, usually among the lowest in the greater Sacramento area however there is often a long wait.  Check Google Maps for gas or Gas Buddy for prices at other places in the area.
It is JUST a Gas Station for Costco members only. Staff is nice, however customers are often not due to having to wait.</Text>

Long lines, cheaper gas (most times), but what else can you expect. It's like knowing it's rush hour and complaining about traffic. Just don't complain or go somewhere else if you're impatient.<//text>

<text>Usually cheaper than anything else but Arco ... Still I prefer pouring Kirkland over Arco any day....But amongst other Costco's in the area this one is the most expensive....for cheaper I always fill at the Stockton one if I'm around there....

Location sucks for not having Diesel as any other Costco in NorCal DOES!...  It also has the oldest machines... my card doesn't get read now and then...

Now with the new quick quack behind ...traffic has gotten hectic... So u gotta be super careful for people going the wrong way out.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

During peak time, its hard to get to the gas station. Lines are too long, all the way on the main street. Right now, the gas price dropped, lower than the ones at Costco on Stockton Blvd and on Elk Grove Blvd.<//Text>
