Work gets done quickly expertly and without a lot of the extra cost. I haven't found a problem that they can't fix. Everything from breaks to check engine lights to having a spark plug pop out of my trucks engine. They can do it. There is a long driveway but don't be alarmed there are some really cool cars back there that you might want to check out while you wait. This place is 100% bilingual. Joe is a very calm, nice, and respectful owner who is trying to pass the business down to his son who is also super positive and down to earth. I wish him and his family all the best for taking care of me and mine.<//Text><name>David Bueno-Hill</name>< Resp>

Coming from a business owner, this company is very efficient with their time and have fantastic prices.
We drove in from Illinois on vacation  and needed an emergency exhaust repair.
In and out in 30 minutes!
Couldn’t be more pleased with the service here.</review>

<text>Went here today for a weird request.  Fill plug on Prius transmission was totally stripped.  Asked if they could weld in a hex head in the stripped out hex head bolt.  After some talking we decided to go for it.  Came some did transmission flush in about 20 minutes.  Wish I thought about this like 2 weeks ago.  I was waiting on a buddy to weld it and a local car shop didnt want to do it said it was a bad idea.  Anyways saved me a ton of many had not other ideas how to get the plug out and dealer wanted 350 for the flush.<//text>< Pics>

I dont get why people are writing bad reviews for this place?  I took my car here to replace my catalytic converter and they did it very fast and for a great price.  Other places were quoting me $500+ and they did it for $240.  I passed my smog because of them.

Update : been using joe a few times now, and now I feel it's a hit or miss with them.  Sometimes I get really great service... other times I feel rushed.< /text>

< review>
By far worst muffler and repair shop ive ever been to the service was bad joe will tell you he ran into some trouble or will not het your car fixed by the time he said, he is unorganized, a liar and just flat out not a good mechanic, i would not recommend this place to anyone i should of listened to my friends when they told me not to go there but he seemed like a nice guy at first, im very disappointed, i dont even wrote reviews but I thought this might help someone else who is deciding on getting any type of service from here, DONT GO HERE. :/< /review>

< review>
I came here to have my Pypes cat-back exhaust system that I purchased for my Mustang installed. It was supposed to a simple bolt-on, but later found out they made unecessary cuts and welds to fit it in. Complete hack job. It rattled when it was hot and I took it to them twice to fix, but the rattle came back. I took it to another muffler shop and they told me what happened and fixed the rattling noise. The reason they get 2 stars is because the price was cheap and they took the car back twice without hassling about the rattling. You get what you pay for here. Also, they are not professional at all. Oversized clothing that is untucked.</review>

Dr.Vivian Ting and the Staff at her Walnut Creek office as well as the Surgical crew at Aspen Surgery center was top Notch! Everyone was professional and caring.  The staff followed up by calling and making sure I was well informed about what the procedure entailed and how recovery would be.  Dr.Ting even made a house call to bring me my compression garment because i hasn’t received it the day of surgery.  I am very pleased with my progress so far and I would definitely use their services in the future. It’s only been one week post-op, but I am already happy with how I look and feel.  Bodytite is a great procedure if you are wanting to have some lasting results that are minimally invasive.  :)</text>

Dr. Ting is the best! She is so talented, thoughtful, and incredibly smart! All things I need in a surgeon. She doesn’t push unnecessary procedures on you, and is great at giving you the most natural looking results. She educates her patients and makes them feel fully confident in their decisions to move forward with a procedure. I’ve done several things with Dr. Ting and will always go back to her when something is needed. To top it all off, she has the BEST staff. They are so responsive, and know the procedures and the products almost as well as Dr. Ting. They always answer my questions and give me honest and thoughtful feedback on any thing I present them with. Angie, LeeAnne, and Dr. Ting make the best team...and make me as a patient feel totally comfortable and incredibly happy with my results! Highly recommended!< /text>

I was referred to Dr Ting, when a routine check up revealed a problematic situation.  It was a stressful time and I was nervous.  But from the very first visit, knew I was in great care.  I felt my concerns were addressed and I immediately felt at ease. The whole process was seamless. From the consult, surgery prep, surgery, post-op needs, and the follow up appointments, and all during a pandemic! I am so happy with my results.  Dr Ting and staff are amazing!<//Review>

<Review>Dr Ting is the most professional and experienced surgeon that I've ever dealt with. Her work is exceptional!

<Review>Recently had surgery related to reconstruction after breast cancer. Dr. Ting, her staff, and the staff at the surgery center could not have been more accessible and caring. It’s less than a week out from surgery, but I can already tell the result is a big improvement.<//Review><Date>1623866488004</Date>< UserId.>

<user_name>Kimberley Hundley<//user_name><Review>Dr. Ting's receptionist is very rude.  I was told that Dr. Ting couldn't even see me because I had Blue Shield PPO and even if I wanted to come in to get a consultation for an out of pocket cosmetic procedure she would NOT see me.  I can't believe that a Dr. would turn away a patient who is paying out of pocket!  Please talk to your staff and make sure they are following the correct protocols.  I know plastic surgeons make millions but is this anyway to treat your prospective clients?< /Review><Gmap_id>0x808561ad7d401299:0x40da6797e3f35d0b</Gmap_id>< resp>

My experience with Dr. Ting and her team has been amazing! I am the type of client who has a TON of questions and struggles with anxiety regarding medical procedures, but Dr. Ting and her staff were nothing but patient and kind with every response. They took the time I needed to address my concerns and discuss any questions every step of the way. My tummy tuck surgery went off without a hitch and I couldn’t be happier with the results! I also had lipo on my lower back, hips and inner thighs during the same procedure. Everything looks great, and after just about 3 months my results are a huge improvement with the scars healing really well. I continue to follow all of Dr. Ting’s suggested tips to ensure that I heal completely with the best results, she has been 100% on point with every assessment throughout this process. I trust her as my surgeon fully and would recommend her to anyone needing help towards their goals! Thank you Dr. Ting and team!! 💖</review>

I had a breast reduction with Dr. Ting. From consult to post-op, Dr. Ting and her staff made this experience better than I could have ever imagined. Dr. Ting was incredibly straightforward and patient during our consult and pre-op. Mercedes and Angie were so helpful and answered any and all questions that I had leading up to my actual procedure. I could not be happier with the way my breasts look now. I'd recommend Dr. Ting to any of my friends (or anyone else) who are looking.<//Text>

<review>I had such a welcoming experience. I will admit I was nervous but the friendly staff helped soothe my nerves. Alexandra and LeeAnne were the best! They did Laser and Alexandra explained every step before doing anything which helped me. If they are confident and knowledgeable then I feel better. I had very minor discomfort during procedure. They offered very detailed instructions for my after care (so helpful) and provided the necessary products as well. Following their aftercare instructions as dictated has helped my healing. My procedure was yesterday, I am healing faster than told and I am excited to see my final results once fully healed. I recommend this practice as everyone is so friendly, professional and very knowledgeable. Thank you  Dr. Ting and staff for your professionalism and excellent work.< /review>< Pictures>

Dr. Ting and staff are amazing! I was diagnosed with breast cancer last year and had to have reconstructive surgery. Dr. Ting explained everything in detail from start to finish, she’s understanding, compassionate and just an amazing doctor. Mercedes and Angie were very helpful and friendly.

After waiting almost a month, and confirming my appointment yesterday, my appointment was canceled because I did not fill out the My Chart a day in advance. I called to say I was in bed sick with a reaction to the COVID shot and did not see the text, but I did confirm. So they canceled because the doctor requires....My question is what about the patient. Sitting in anticipation for over a month, confirming, and then being cancelled does not seem very customer-centric. I go the feel Dr Ting's staff was very self-important.< /review>< resp>

It sounds like you’re not having a good day and that your disappointment in having to reschedule your visit has really affected you. Our staff really tries hard to please everyone but we can’t always succeed. We do ask that patients fill out their history questionaire beforehand so that I have a more thorough picture of your past medical problems, past surgeries, medications, allergies, social habits and  prior cosmetic procedures.  Having this done ahead of time makes the consultation more thorough and efficient and reduces the chance that important  facts are missed.  LeeAnne will be happy to reschedule your consultation for a day when you are feeling better.  I hope you get well soon. Best regards, Dr. Ting'}</resp>

< Review>
I am in my mid 50s and had the typical loose jowls.  I wanted to tighten the skin around my jowls but was ambivalent about an invasive facelift.  I had done my research and discovered facetite as an alternative.  I discovered that there were not that many providers in my area that did this procedure and was happy to find Dr.  Ting.  Not only did I do the facetite, I also did upper blepharoplasty and was very happy with the results.
Dr. Ting has extensive experience in breast  reconstruction, so when I decided to improve the shape of my breast, I obviously turned to Dr. Ting for that procedure as well.  I opted for fat grafting.  The bonus?  I ended up with a shapelier version of myself in addition to improved breast shape.
I had been unhappy with the results of a septoplasty done more than a decade ago and decided it was time to get a revision.  I had been very satisfied with all my other results, and knowing Dr. Ting still actively performs ER surgeries I was confident in my decision to have her do my nose revision.
I was absolutely pleased with the results.  After all these procedures, I am thrilled to say I simply look like a refreshed version of myself.
Not only is Dr. Ting a very nice person, she also is blessed with  a wide skill set in cosmetic procedures.    Thank  you  Dr. Ting and staff😄</Review>

I’d like to start by saying that Dr. Ting and her staff are absolutely fabulous. Dr. Ting and her staff treated me with respect and kindness understanding and compassion. They treated me well and I’m very grateful to them. I’ve had two after weight-loss surgeries and they were smooth from beginning till end. The staff was very thorough in walking me through the process and never hesitated answering all my questions. If you follow her instructions Verbatim you won’t have any issues and be pleasantly surprised! The quality of her work is amazing. I had a question immediately following my second surgery and Dr. Vivian got right on the phone with my wife immediately. My wife was my caregiver afterwords and felt very comfortable with the instructions and felt fully informed of what she needed to do to take care of me for the best outcome. I cannot say enough to how much I respect this doctor and her staff.</Text>

<text>Dr. Ting is the best.  I noticed my jawline had softened and was shockingly going south when I saw profile pics. Heck, even frontal views weren't looking right. I wanted something with no pain and little downtime.  We went with FaceTite for the jawline only.

She listens carefully and answers all your questions. She will tell you what to expect and whether you're a good candidate for what you're planning. Both Angie and the Dr. worked to give me options and make the procedure feasible for me.

It's only 3 mo out and my results are stunning!  Whenever I want anything else done, I know I will go to her first. She and her friendly staff were there for the entire journey making sure I was comfortable from beginning to end. She is an artist who knows her craft well. So happy to have found her!<//text><gmap_id>0x808561ad7d401299:0x40da6797e3f35d0b</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Ting is incredibly skilled and talented. I’m so pleased with the results of her work.  My surgery went very well.  Dr. Ting and her staff patiently answered my questions so I was very confident and relaxed as I went into surgery.  The shape of my face is very natural.  I’m me but improved. I highly recommend Dr. Ting.</review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I'm so happy I chose Dr. Ting for my surgery. I had consults with 2 other surgeons prior to choosing Dr. Ting and I chose her because she was very detailed, thorough, professional, honest, knowledgeable, and patient. She spent a lot of time with me listening to what my goals were, answering all my questions and making sure I was comfortable with the decisions about the procedure. Her office staff were always kind, polite, and quick to respond. I have had no issues after surgery and I'm thrilled with my very natural and beautiful results. Dr. Ting delivered on exactly what I asked for. I would go to her again for any future procedures.</Review>< Pics>

Dr. Ting is wonderful! I wanted to do some face tightening that was minimally invasive and she recommended facetite. The procedure was quick and while it does take a while to see the results, 3 months later I am SO happy. The team in her office are very professional and really lovely every time I see them. I would recommend Veritas to any and all!</Review>

< Review>
Dr. Ting is a wonderful plastic surgeon. She is more concerned with your health than making money. She wouldn’t perform my surgery with out me first getting a mammogram, physical, and bloodwork. I felt so confident knowing that she placed so much value on health and had such high standards. I had other consultants with plastic surgeons who did not require mammograms and did not hold the same standard. I’m so happy with my choice in plastic surgeons and with my results!<//Review>

Dr. Ting is careful, honest, detail-oriented and very sweet.
The ladies who are part of her staff are very polite and the hospital she uses for the procedures has an amazing team of nurses.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

I absolutely love Dr. Ting! I have been to her office multiple times for a few different treatments. I had done Botox, which Dr. Ting administered, she was so gentle I didn’t even know when she poke me with a needle to inject me. Also she offered numbing cream but I didn’t need this. I also had done Laser ClearSkin treatment and Tyte and Bryte to improve pigmentation on my face. This treatment was done by her wonderful nurse Shoshana. She was great, telling me of what she is going to do next so you’re not surprised when the laser light flash on your face. Also she was really good in giving directions when to turn my head etc. Oh and the front and back staff is very professional and super friendly,  they always make sure you leave the office happy. Overall great experience.</text>

Dr Vivian is awesome!! I had a Breast reduction surgery and everything went smooth and perfect. I can thank enough to Dr Vivian and the stuff! Kris (assistant) is such a professional I don't know how many times I call and went there because of silly stuff and they all were so patient with me. Don't think about it too much, she is a professional and everything is going to be ok!</Text>

I am extremely happy with my final results. Dr Ting helped me make decisions on what would look and feel most “natural”, and the end result is very natural looking and better then I expected. I would definitely recommend Dr Ting and am very happy with my final results.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1565463924673, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your kind review!

I had a breast augmentation a year ago and it looks nothing like I had expected it to. One breast looks smaller than the other. I regret ever getting my breast done.

<date>1574134360808<//date><Text>I’ve waited 2 yrs to writing this. I am still in daily pain from Dr. Tings neck (face) lift. I went in for a necklift and maybe help w/under eye aging. Dr Ting said that there was no such procedure as a neck lift, only facelift. When I asked about under eye, she was obviously afraid to work in that area and recommended H20 laser which left me with red eye lids and blue vein’s exposed under my eyes that weren’t there prior. My cheeks now have a wide visible line that run from upper ear to bottom of cheek. Behind my ears are very lumpy in texture and still painful, making it hard to wear glasses. When I even lightly touch my face in cheek area it feels like an electro shock and is quite painful. My chin woddle area has several lumps, which looks strange. Prior I  was upfront about needing a firm quote for budgeting, but my fees were well over what I was quoted. $15k All fees are paid up front so you don’t have any recourse and Dr Ting had many excuses such as more healing time needed (which is why I waited so long), she’d never had a patients skin react as mine did, etc.
I have friends and relatives that have had this same procedure (and more)and none are left with the pain I'm experiencing.</Text>< Pictures>

<response>{'time': 1527284570187, 'text': "Dear Makena: Thank you for your review and I am very sorry that you were not happy with your experience.  I apologize if there was miscommunication and I will be happy to readdress anything that you wish to discuss again.  I see all my surgery patients out to the recovery room, 1 week later, 6 weeks later, 3 months later and 1 year later. This is our standard office policy. Sometimes when a patient is still recovering from the effect of anesthesia there can be no recollection of the surgeon at the bedside postop because of the amnestic effect of the anesthesia medications. I assure you that I was in the recovery room after your procedure but like most busy surgeons we cannot stay beyond a few minutes because of the next patient that requires surgery to follow yours and we often are still in surgery after you are ready to be discharged. I apologize for any delays in office visits--these, too, are often not always under my control and depend on patients' arrival time and consultation needs.\nI hope that we can discuss your remaining concerns at the 1 year mark and I am happy to go further as you desire but I feel that I performed the procedure based on your specific limitations. I wish you the best always and my door is always open to you."}<//response><Review>Horrible bedside manner—did not even come see me after breast reduction surgery or tell me how it went. Kept me waiting over an hour my last three appointments and when she finally came in she talked to me for barely five minutes, and seems bored/annoyed to be talking with me or answering my questions. I just had a 3 month post-surgery apt and learned that she did not do what we had discussed prior to surgery and I am unhappy with the results, she told me if I want what we originally discussed I have to do another surgery...Go to someone else.</Review><Name>Makena Paynton< /Name><pics>None</pics>< Date>

<response>{'time': 1559176954895, 'text': 'Thank you for your review. Allow me to explain why we charge a consultation fee.  Plastic surgery offices have a high overhead because we want to have enough highly experienced staff to help you with your questions and recovery.  They need to be paid a fair salary that represents their level of skill.  In order to invest in the latest technology there is a significant overhead cost.  The nominal fee helps to cover these expenses. Our consultation fee also helps to guarantee patients get enough time to being evaluated and it is typical of most offices.\n\nPaying a consultation fee does not guarantee that Dr. Ting will perform the procedure you are interested in. That is the point of the consultation: to determine what would be the best treatment, if any, for your issue. Prior to scheduling your consultation our staff tries very hard to make sure your requests are appropriate ones but the final assessment can only be done in person.'}< /response>< gmapID>

The place is good and people very helpful.  Phone system is horrible can't get a live person.  Loops you through automated responses and never get a live person.  Would be helpful and a time saver if you could speak to someone before you go and wait in line.</text>

Love having AAA. What ever I need to do in the DMV I can go to the AAA and get it done there in the fraction of the time! Even during this pandemic there is hardly a line to get in. I was there yesterday to register my 1980 Toyota Corolla and waited a total of 5 seconds before being seen by a agent. The transaction itself took a mere 5 minutes. 👍👍👍<//Text>

During this year 2020, AAA is coming through for the customer. They manage to stay open. The office is Covid-19 approved. All services remain open. Precautions are taken of course, but excellent service is their hallmark and it remains.<//Review>

Came here to remove a family member off the title. Definitely beats going all the way to the DMV. And even right now with this Covid 19 going on, its better to come here since random DMVs are closed. The staff was super helpful and the line was short. Just be aware that as of June 20th,2020 there is only 1 person allowed inside per transaction. So if you're coming with family or friends, they most likely won't be allowed to tag along. Other than that this AAA location is great.< /Review>

Went in the afternoon on a weekday. In and out was fast (~20 mins) for getting a international drivers permit. Filled out the forms online prior to arrival. Also, payable with credit card for getting the permit. Lastly, remember to bring 2 passport photos too. Location does take passport photos if needed.<//Review>

Never have I ever received such horrible service! I had called triple A because I locked my keys inside my vehicle. I called at 1:26 pm and the  dispatcher alerted me the eta was 2:22pm. Soon afterwards I receive a text message from the technician saying he will arrive at at 3:07 pm or sooner .... at 2:55 pm he messages me informing me he will be herencia in 20 minutes... which is after the second eta I was given. This is ridiculous! Unprofessional, will be canceling my membership with them.<//review>

< Review>
Wating here is just as long as DMV wait. Defeats purpose if you have member ship just for that.
Waited 1 hour to pay for title transfer, had to get it smogged. I come back and had to wait another hour in order to pay registration. They stated I couldn't pay them online, because I started the process with them.
Downey AAA has better customer service and faster services.< /Review>

<text>Was told by Agent Sergio that Saturday's are not recommended to come in so I can add my vehicle over the phone and I do as he said. Turns out I still have to come in to take photos which he never mention to me in the first place and now waiting time is over an hour. Should have just came for everything in the beginning instead of wasting time on the phone only to come back and wait over an hour. I am definitely switching after my year is up. Horrible service! They Sure live up to their horrible customer service!<//text>< time>

I have very bad experience and memory with this office.  I had to come back 3 times  Wednesday  Thuraday and Friday to get auto transfer and registration due to lack of empathy and no customer service . The staff treat us like nobody eventhough I am being 10 years as paying  member of AAA. I eve have my house insurance with AAA FOR 3 years .<//Text>

That my house didn't qualify so I was waiting for a phone call and didn't call me back, soi called him. Bad bad bad customer service. Who hired him, he's a bad insurance agent.

Go early in the morning because if you go after 12pm it gets extremely packed and for some reason they frequently have DMV system outages which cause all sorts of drama for the people waiting to be next in line.  On more than one occasion I've seen employees go out to lunch in the middle of  a heavy rush with no none to back up their shifts, which can be very frustrating for the customers waiting in line!<//Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) It cannot be possible that they do not accept a debit card. If they have the visa logo on the door. Very bad experience thanks to that I had to pay surcharges for my plates😡

<text>Came here to see if they could get the sap stains off my GTI. I appreciate that the guy helping me tried first before to see if it's possible. Unfortunately he wasn't able to remove it, but he did make a good suggestion regarding my leather seats which were indeed dry.  Despite just paying for the leather seat reconditioning they also washed the exterior and cleaned the interior including my rubber mats. Second time here and second time being pleased with their service.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNsTjnIIj1vFkvnE8-iUmVkr9wgB2tu4fTwDyM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Response>

<review>Marin cars shine with Shineology!
Actually, I should say SF to Santa Rosa maybe more, who drives along Redwood Highway 101 benefits from these guys; get their cars cleaned and shined! Manager Herber and his team did a great job for my car. Mohammad at the register was also nice and helpful. Customer and car friendly service!..< /review>< Pics>

Although the cleaning staff did a great job, I found it challenging to understand what I was actually getting in my service. I found it challenging to understand what I was getting because the sales staff was too busy trying to upsell me. I’d go back, but I wouldn’t engage with the sales reps again. Not a great idea to insult your customers when they don’t want the upsell.</text>

Shineology did a wonderful job on my car. I got so many compliments on it because of how noticeable the difference was.

I realized the next day that I was missing an item that had been taken out during cleaning, and when I went back Fidel was there with my item in hand. He had set it aside and labeled it. So organized and on top of everything.

Thank you to the entire shineology squad, but especially Fidel! :D</text>

Heavy pressure to upgrade your purchase but saying No Thanks takes care of it.  Good job overall.  Just don't like the attempts to upsell< /text>

Friendly folks here, explained some of stains and even showed how to remove them. Offered deep discount on detail buy didn't have time to do it. Will certainly come back.< /text>

Looks like they are trying but... wow so sloppy. Puddles on the interior that I had to mop up myself. They left dust streaks on the dashboard. Next time I need a wash I'll be looking for another place.< /Review>

Very poor. Deluxe wash left stain on bonnet and roof, unclean inside and trunk unvaccummed.

They did it again and car still dirty. 40min, $35 bucks not happy.</text>

First time in Sacramento and I love it ... walking under the amazing trees. I really enjoyed talking to a young gentleman at the Old Town Visitor's Center.
Chris Sapolu was so knowledgeable and helpful.  Made my trip extra special.<//Text>

< Review>
I go here all the time and they are always on point! The woman that helped me most recently helped me to find natural incense that did not use artificial fragrance. She was very knowledgeable about all of the products in the store and was able to direct me to two brands that did not have artificial perfume or anything. We then went on to talk with her in general about artificial perfumes being used in incense and it was neat to have somebody that had so much knowledge! Some stores I go to the people that are selling the stuff don't know anything about what they're selling! Even better I was told that if I did not like and since that I got that I could return it!< /Review>

<Text>This unique Metaphysical Shop is housed in the heart of Belmont Shore.

Z Fabrique is well stocked with stick and cone incense, my main reason for shopping there, but they also resin, charcoal, carry an array of candles, crystals, ethnic art, jewelry, new age supplies, as well as esoteric goods,  and much more.

Reasonable prices per minute Card Readings are available for those who are interested and if that's your thing.

Even if you're just curious, this is a cute shop to simply browse, just make sure you venture into the back room for additional merchandise.

I don't know the woman typically at the front counter but she has always been pleasant and friendly...always willing to answer questions, eager to tell you about the shop, and provide helpful info if needed.  Don't be bashful not to strike up a conversation of the Earth's Cycles/Phases.

Other items that I shop for other than incense are The Naked Bee Sandalwood Hand Lotion, Power Mini Crystal Bracelets, and their small Tumbled Stones.

So, if your out and about on 2nd Street, take a stroll on  Argonne Street to check the shop out for yourself.<//Text><user_id>109400339007566227056< /user_id><rating>5<//rating>< name>

I go here often and everytime it’s a fantastic experience. They have such unique pieces. High quality crystal jewelry. A lot of my favorite jewelry items come from here. They have a plethora of incense and candles.< /text>

<Review>The loveliest shop in all of long beach. The owner has such a kind heart and helped me pick out the perfect crystals. Beautiful selection of incense and decor, herbs and of course, the huge stunning crystals in the back room. Z Fabrique is the best.<//Review><user_id>114495236129879951962< /user_id><name>Sara Ervin</name>< Time>

I grew up going to this shop and judging by the photos it has not changed a BIT. That’s a good thing!! It’s THE COOLEST store to visit in Belmont Shores and absolutely the best place to buy someone a gift. They have something for absolutely anyone. The energy is always welcoming and patient. Magical. I still have some oils from there which are now almost 25 years old and they still smell as good as the day I bought them! Clover and cucumber, straw-razzleberry, so fun to mix oil scents there. Wish I could stop in for another visit!! I live in North Carolina now though.< /text>

<Review>This little shop is hidden just off of 2nd street, but has a wide variety of spiritual and healing items that can't easily be found elsewhere.  They carry a plethora of crystals, one of a kind books, tarot card decks, talismans, and many other specialized healing and spiritual items.  Make sure to check out every first Thursday of the month they invite about 10-20 various kinds of healers and card readers to do 15 minute sessions from about 6-9pm.  It is donation based, I try to tip 20+ dollars because you can receive numerous readings or healings in one night.  All of them are great!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I love what I do because of the  great people that come into the store. (Although trying to unload pallets and fit the stuff in my little store drives me nuts sometimes. Otherwise, I find it such a joy to be at work.) I feel so blessed. Again, my sincerest thanks."}<//Response>
< Review>
This is a delightful little shop that is just off the beaten path. You won't find another like it in the Shore. There are so many unique items for your home and for your spirit that you could easily spend quite a while just browsing through this little place. There is an extensive and wide selection of incense that is very reasonably priced. I think it was over 15 years ago that I discovered this little gem and met the owner, Nancy Scott. She's a very warm and friendly woman who is passionate about her store and the items she carries. Do yourself a favor and get off the main street: slip down a half block (south side of 2nd, on Argonne Ave) and into Z Fabrique. I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed!<//Review>

I have bought rings here as their selection is large and carries different sizes. However i asked two different people about a particular stone and got mixed descriptions.

They're the best I recommend everybody go in there and try their ham and cheese, it's the best way to start your morning!  Just make sure you tell them to microwave it that way the cheese is all gooey and delicious. Even better do what I do go in there every morning and get one just make sure he leaves one for me.</review>

If you want a good fresh donut go here. They really have the best tasting donuts and they are very nice people . I  do go elsewhere when they are closed. But they are not as good as J and D'  it's just a disappointment . If you haven6t tried this place yet you really should. You won't be disappointed.<//review>

Fresh donuts at 10:00 am on a Sunday! Not your average donuts. We've been going there for 5 years and they always have a great selection. Fast, friendly and easy to find.</review>

Love that they provide donuts morning and evening. The people here are super nice, donuts are middle of the road. I'd return if in the area.< /Text>

<Text>This is a Cantonese Restaurant known for its delicious dishes. However, the Diet Coke came in a can, no fountain, no refills. the services falls short as most of the Chinese restaurants around the Rowland Heights area. The services stop Once they placed your order on the table. They don't check back to make sure everything is good. They don't see empty glasses need refills. And surprisingly They were no thank you after I paid my bill. The interior was chic but out of place, there are disco lights hanging from the ceiling like a night club. The bathrooms were clean but the funky unfit toilet seat evidencing the careless management. So, here are my ratings:

Food is tasty. We come here for Hong Kong style food. They actually use real salted fish in their salted fish dishes. This is a taste from the past that I crave every so often. It is super tasty but is an acquired taste. Some people think the smell and taste is strong but I love it! As for dessert, we love the Hong Kong waffles.  So tasty! Sweet and crunchy and hot! Yum! All the kids and adults love it.</Text>

The food was pretty good. The eggettes were really moist and crunchy outside. I also got the sauted beef and it was delicious as well. Great flavor and went well with the rice.< /Text>

Nestled in the culdesac next to the fenced field.  Besides the parking lot patrons can park in the parking structure as well.  The fried rice could be drier and reduce the greasy smell that comes with the rice.  Wonton noodle is ok.  The crispy mimi pancake bites is the attraction of the menu.<//Text>

The whole chain of Tasty Garden restaurants are pretty much standardized in their quality. They decor differs but all have a hip Hong Kong style that reflects the Westernized Hong Kong style Chinese food that they serve.< /Text>

Food was good. Waitress had an attitude though. Not expecting great service in this type restaurant but it was way below par.</text>

Good all you can eat hotpot place. Around 25 per person a bit pricey but quality is good and it is acye.  Service is okay most works are basic English speakers and they understand and reply right away.< /Review>

<time>1452484227595<//time><rate>4</rate><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Text>As far as AYCE hot pot places go, tasty garden proves to be satisfactory.  The meats, although never the best quality for AYCE, are enjoyable, and some of their seafood balls are freshly made, supposedly by hand.

In addition to the meats and vegetable selections, they also provide a buffet bar style for sides, which I love, since I can never have enough picked cucumber, wood ear, and roasted peanuts.

One thing they need to work on is the number of staff, it's simply not enough. All members of the staff are busy running around, and it's simply not enough for the size of the restaurant.</Text><name>Link Lo</name>< gmap_id>

Been here several times. Normally i find "outside"  chinese food not appetizing because we cook well at home. However, this place has some really good dishes which i feel we would need too much effort to replicate at home. The dried scallops and egg white fried rice, the french style filet mignon, and the X.O. sauce sauteed string beans in particular are just done so perfectly, i won't even bother trying to make them at home any more... just come over here, sit down and chat away while waiting for the perfectly done dishes to be served! The bonus is the big airy space and relatively quiet (due to the big space) ambiance that allows you to speak normally instead of trying to shout to be heard. These fast food style hong kong dishes here are also much cheaper than neighboring "restaurants" which may not even taste as good. You have been warned... you could get hooked on this place.<//text>

Very small rooms if you have a big family a little tight. Service was ok. Once your food was on table very seldom came to check on us. Also, didn't receive some of our order but they did take it off the bill.<//review>

There're not many true Hong Kong style cafe restaurants left in the area any more.Tasty Garden Rowland Heights is one of the many left. Well, as real HongKongnese, man, we have to HK style hot milk tea, coffee tea, icy ored bean, little chicken eggs, instant noodle with spam meat and sunny side up eggs....etc. those true HongKong neighborhood cafe style gourmets and speaks100% HongKong dialect of waiters and waitresses... Hey, not feak ones from China or Southeast Asia I am talking about, and Tasty has almost 85-90%, I say is enough for HongKongnese to enjoy leaving in Southern Cal. 4 1/2 Stars.< /review>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>(Translated by Google) It’s not very close to the people. Many shops in the Eastern service are not smiling. The food is good and the portion is large. The indoor environment is large. As long as it is not for the sofa area, the feet can’t reach up and will hit the table. How short can it be? Personally, I think it can be cleaner. I don't know why the smell of smoke will come in from the staff door or where it is. It feels disgusting and bad. = =

沒有很親民，東方服務態度很多店家都沒笑容，吃的東西不錯份量大，室內環境大，只要不是沙發區腳都伸不了起身還會撞到桌子，是能多矮？個人覺得能再乾淨點，不知為何有菸味會從員工門還是哪裡進來，噁心，感覺很差。= =<//Review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) For the first time more than ten years ago, I dine in the "Daoxiang Village" in Fangquangu City. As soon as I entered the restaurant, the smell of the rice came to my nose. At that time, I thought that the taste was just like its name, rice fragrance. Once changed its name to "Dao Xiang" English name "tasty" to become a chain store, there are semicolons everywhere, tried Fangcheng, Irvine and Roland Gang, the dishes are still the same, the taste is OK, but the original rice fragrance no longer exists ,Pity. Originally planned to be four stars, because of the lack of memorable rice fragrance, there is one star less.

十多年前第一次是在芳泉谷市的「稻香村」用餐，一進餐廳飯香味撲鼻而來，當時就想到那味道就如其名，米香。曾幾何時改名為「稻香」英文名「tasty」成為連銷店，各地均有分號，試過芳城，尔湾及罗蘭岡的，菜式依舊，味道可，唯原來的飯香味不復存在，可惜了。原擬為四星，因少了那令人懷念飯香味也就少了一星。< /Text>

Overpriced and double charging is the reason! Rude owner that denied the double charge and got upset with me when showed evidence.</Review>< Gmap_id>

By far, the selection of what you'd need, from water pipes to your own vape, to a simple coca-cola and snack, I can tell you from experience that Marina Smoke Shop will leave you satisfied; leaving you with a nostalgic feeling of being at home with this family run business. #epic<//Review>< GmapID>

I went to this place to use their Bitcoin ATM. Their ATM is situated near the entrance. It accepts only $20 bills and above. Their ATM is conveniently straight forward. Make sure you have the QR code to your wallet readily available, or else you will have to print a paper wallet (which takes time to confirm.) My overall experience was great EASY, FAST, SAFE, and hassle free. I highly recommend going to this ATM for all your Bitcoin purchases!<//review>

Absolute rip off sold me Novo pods for 25 when they're 8 to 15 everywhere else. No selection of any decent vape products, pipes, pieces, smoking gear or anything. This place is a joke with it's flashing lights and nasty incents smells, horrible selection. They're trying to sell the worst quality products for 4 times the normal price.< /Text>

Hart motors came highly recommend from a friend of mine who is also a mechanic who works for the city! Hart made me feel their trustworthiness and because of their many years of experience I knew they would do an excellent job in diagnosing and fixing my car!! My car is running like a dream now! I couldn’t be happier!! This is definitely the start of a permanent relationship! Great mechanics! Awesome owner!!<//review>

I’m always afraid of trying new mechanics. This time I had a very positive experience. I had a low coolant warning light while driving back home from Vegas and this was also after having my coolant system replaced by another mechanic. Because of COVID, I don’t have to drive as much, so I sat on it for a while out of fear of being taken advantage of by another mechanic. I finally decided after the new year to get it fixed. Did a search and found Hart. Ara was very friendly and happy. He called me pretty quick to let me know what they found and the cost. And then, my car was ready the next day! I was expecting to wait weeks like the last mechanic. But it was ready one day later. And this is the coolant system on a BMW! I pick up my car. Very good pricing for coolant system repair on a BMW. I start driving it and it feels awesome! They did such a great job. I’m very happy with it.</text>

<Text>Another great visit to Ori's. My brake light has been on and knew going here would be the best. I brought my car in at 930 and said I needed it done by 1. Called at 1230 and it was ready to go. Quoted me $225 and walked out paying $245. So, nice walking into a place wont rip you off. Will be back for more work that needs to be done. Thanks again Paul!</Text>< name>

Booked an appointment through CarMax RepairPals. Read the reviews before booking and they were pretty good. Came in this morning and it was just as advertised. Friendly service. Quick turnaround (for my service anyway). I have more services that need to be done and I will be coming back.<//Review>

<text>Ara takes good care of your car that will give you peace of mind that you know you are safe to drive again.     He will suggests what's good for the car and what will benefit the customers well being.   He takes time to do the job instead of rushing to finish it.   He will help you save money by giving you reasonable price for their service and discounts if you're triple aaa member.    He has a "drop off/pick up service" so no time will be wasted.  He will educate you about your car so you understand what to do and not what to do w your car.   Mostly, anytime you call and need service for your car, his shop has always time.  No need for appt so it makes convenient for me.  Above, he is very professional and treats his customers w respect.  More power to HART MOTORS!< /text>< Pics>

Ara Hartoonian and his crew at Hart Motors have serviced our 3 cars for many years now. They are AAA approved, not all shops are, and that is why we initially went there after some bad luck elsewhere. We have continued on with them as our go-to shop ever since. Ara is reliable, practical, and honest. Beyond the specific job being done at the time, he always checks the car over in general. This practice has alerted us to a few bigger problems he saw as potentially coming up later on and as something to watch and avoid, ahead of time. Ara has saved us a lot of money and trouble in the long run. He’s straight up and not pushy. Going that extra mile is something many auto shops just don’t do anymore. Much appreciated. With Hart Motors we know our cars will continue to be dependable and safe. Highly recommended!</text>

I’ve been coming to Hart Motor’s” for a while. I will continue to do so because Mr. Hart is so honest. I’m a single person and have been to many other mechanics (before I found Hart Motors). People take advantage of a single woman (that may not know much about cars) not at Hart Motors.
I’ve also recommended him to my family and friends.< /Text>

<review>I am from OC and my car broke down near his shop.  AAA suggested his shop and he was super helpful and nice.  It was towed to his shop after hours and the next morning when I called I explained my situation he was able to work with me on the timing of the job.  If I lived in the area I would make him my usual mechanic.<//review>< Pictures>

If I could rate this company 0 stars I would. I came in for an inspection which was needed by the insurance. The insurance company stated after the inspection I could choose where I wanted my repairs done. Me not knowing the process, they kept my car. I was still in shock from being rear ended only a few hours earlier that day. I call to see if the inspection and estimate had been completed. I was informed the estimate had not been completed.  I informated them that I would be picking up my vehicle to take it elsewhere.  I was informed my car was undrivable as they had taken off the bumper. And because they took the bumper off, I cannot take my car elsewhere without paying for labor. Don't trust this place.<//text>

<text>I first came to Hart Motors  via AAA tow.  I had a Mazda wagon with problems.  Repairs were made and it ran until the transmission totally died.  Too expensive to fix an old car.  Next car 2001 Chevy Malibu.  Had the AAA 40 point inspection and had several problems, again a used car that owners before me didn't fix. Fixed the critical ones and have had the others fixed along the way.  Last visit, A/C blowing hot and the temps 100+ every day.  Took the car in on Saturday, got refrigerant put in and now blowing cold. ( the previous owner neglected to add refrigerant). Ara does not upsell to make money.  If he finds a problem (and he does a good inspection), he tells me what it is,  the seriousness and I have the choice to repair or not.  He has a lot of repeat customers who have brought numerous cars to him over years.  That is the sign of a good mechanic. I trust Ara and his staff.  Since I am a senior lady, trust in a service to be honest and fair are important. 5+ all the way!<//text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

My family has taken our vehicles here for years. Have always had good service and the staff has always been kind. They have even done small things (such as changing out lights) without charging us.</review>

I have taken my truck to Hart motors more than once. Ara always gives you an honest answer and his prices are fair. Before finding Hart I would take my truck to the dealer, what a nightmare. Double the price of Hart and never finished when they promised it to be done. I like Hart and would definitely recommend giving them a try.<//Review>

I went in for a smog check recently and the work was done quickly and efficiently.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  A potential problem with my tire pressure gauge was communicated to me, for which I am grateful.< /text>

Excellent work, and flexible to the point of picking up for return to use in the middle of servicing.  I was not isolated because they backed me up.</review>

Okay - this is a, "Five Stars for Taco Bell" five star rating. I mean, 5 stars at Taco Bell is not the same as 5 stars at Ruth Chris. It's clean. Fast. Friendly service.< /review>

Well, I would leave a better review if the place hasn't been closed for a month and a half for remodeling. With no info about its reopening as a cherry on top. Thanks taco bell, oh yea, they also removed the chicken burrito. Bye bye Taco Bell, you lost a costumer.< /Review>

Super fast at the  drive-thru and the order was accurate. Well, except I asked the girl for sauce and she said it was in bag. I didn't check because they had it sealed with a sticker and there was no sauce.</Review>

Fantastic donuts and great customer service.  I work at 6 am and can never get anything but fast food to eat. Found this gem of a place and was so thrilled. I can text them my order and its ready to go when I show up. Delicious burritos, and big enough to share.< /review>

<Review>I celebrated my PhD this evening in this gorgeous place. I am glad to say that we passed a cool evening and the place was unquestionably one of the reasons for that outstanding celebration. The waiters  collaborated in a very nice style, the food was very good and my guests were so  delighted. We shall no dout return for more joyful events. Thank you very much.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2389c001beb4b:0x857e66b81f3133bf</Gmap_id></record>

If you are driving through, stop here! We plan our trip so we can get breakfast. Their breakfast sandwich is OF THE HOOK! Get it with two eggs over easy and grab some napkins! Burrito is amazing and the coffee (three different roasts to choose from) is gooood!< /text>

< Review>
Terrible service, the store needs a major renovation and they can never seem to get orders right and They DONT answer the store phone and the entire management team sucks especially the District manager which is why the store sucks now

I waited at least 15 mins to be served cold cheese on a mini quesodilla and no one can explain why in the store yet they claim they cooked it as policy permits
Dont let them ask you to back up and pull forward again in the drive-thru because if an accident happens the store isnt technically liable
Oh and there is literally a new face everytime I go
They lost my patronage because they think that just because they are franchise they can do what they want and not have to answer to anyone
I dont patronize any Taco Bell locations due to the royal screw up of a store this location is from the District manager ALL the way down</Review>

<Review>We told 2nd  person at drive thru we did not get straws 3 times. He kept shoving food out on a tray saying everything was in the bag. After exiting we looked and they were NOT there. Had to go back, knock on door, and ask another employee for them.  The lady employees were nice and helpful but we felt the gentleman needed more customer service training.</Review>< Time>

This was an absolutely amazing buffet! Each member of the staff was incredibly welcoming and my party and I could not have any complaints about them.

There is a plethora of cuisines to choose from: chinese, korean, italian, american, vietnamese, japanese, tuscan (?), etc. There are so many different types of salads and fresh pressed smoothies for all of my health gurus.< /text>

Taco Bell has great tastes and I miss their old limited edition menus. But often sometimes their foods are soggy and usually their food seem rushed based on how less or too much of certain parts if the dish are.<//text>

Taco Bell is Taco Bell and this one is no different. Interior was clean, service was quick and polite. It was everything I ever wanted out of a Taco Bell, with the exception of a conspicuously absent talking Chihuahua.</review>

<Review>Let's be honest guys, it's fast food. We've had good experiences here and really, really cruddy ones. Service is very hit or miss and the food follows. The dining area is usually clean. The restrooms are ok.<//Review></record>

Excellent combination of food and service.  My food was ready before I could get my drink and had an exceptional flavor once I did.  Good job!!<//review>

<Review>delicious as usual, this location particularly is very consistent with quality, speed and friendliness. I love Taco Bell, the cheesy gordita crunch is my favorite item hands down and has been for years. Don't get me wrong I eat the other items as well and I like to try the new ones here and there but I always find myself going back to the Gordita Crunch.🤔<//Review></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Honestly the worst taco bell I've been to. Terrible quality control. We go in every once in a while if I dont feel like cooking dinner and there is ALWAYS something wrong with the order. The food is always lopside (meaning the ingredients are not throughout the item, such as a crunchwrap having all the meat at the bottom, lettuce tomatoes in the middle and sour cream/cheese on top?) Its to the point I dont even order a crunchwrap anymore, that's not the only item this happens with but just an example. I've gotten a simple soft taco and gotten home to realize there was no meat, only cheese and lettuce... the one thing I can say is that the workers work FAST. But once you get your meal it's literally slopped together, and all thrown into ONE bag...so everything is squashed anyway. You dont put a grilled stuff burrito on top of crunchy tacos and a gordita... it makes at least half the meal inedible. We just wont come anymore, it's not worth being disappointed and having to find something else to eat anyway. Save your time and money.<//review>

Hats off to her as a two year old boy dropped a gold plated necklace in the trash.... like something most two year olds do right? 😊.... She uncovered the trash lid, dug thru it and found the necklace for the kiddo. Sara needs a raise ☺</text>< Response>

There was hardly any chicken, and cheese on it and I was not impressed. I've had Taco salads before at other Taco Bells and they were far better than the one I got...< /Text>

< review>
We have lived here for 22 years, the Taco Bell on Rosamond Blvd. in Rosamond Ca. Has the worst food ever!! If you want it fresh than plan on eating there so if it tastes like it was made in the morning you can take it back!!! Why don't the managers care??? Make the food when it is ordered!! Put some meat in the dam tacos. I had to also add extra cheese to my casadias !! Wow!! Please let this town get some better fast food!!</review>

<text>Really hit and miss. In the afternoons the majority of the time, the foods going to taste terrible. At nights you're going to have that taco bell you've been craving. Definitely an issue with management.< /text>< pics>

Havent even left the store yet and my stomach hurts. The employes were rude. Took 15 min to get my food with only 2 other customers in the store. And i ordered a 5 layer burrito and still trying to figure out what it is. Never coming back.< /Text>

It's Taco Bell. If you have had it, you either like it or hate it. If you never had it, you may as well try it to see where you are in the 2 categories.< /review>

Come on its Tacobell you know the indegestion you are in for eating here. This one is easy to get in and out of because of the red light. Store has always been clean when I visited. Worth a stop to get out of traffic for a few minutes in the afternoon.</review>

<text>Just went to this Taco Bell and must say it was not good.  There was no one in line when I arrived and I waited 10-15 minutes to order but no one waited on me.  A worker did come out of the restroom and immediately went to the back.  There was a cook also.  I left without ordering.  I needed to write a review as this is the second time this same incident happened.  And to think, in a few years these workers will get $15.00 an hour!  Unbelievable.</text><username>mtbaldy58<//username><date>1483212207172<//date>< gmapID>

The cashier was not very friendly or helpful, which should have been my first clue. I ordered a box meal and sat down to wait, and boy did I wait. I waited for almost 25 minutes seeing others get their food and leave. I finally decided that maybe something wasn't right. I talked to the cashier who asked for my receipt and after going to the back came up and told me my order never went through. She never once thought to check on me or even apologize for anything. The only redeeming factor was that the manager was very apologetic, yet didn't offer any type of compensation for my wasted time. I personally will not be going back.<//text>< pictures>

The food tastes pretty good and they are generous with the toppings. However, the drive thru staff are not friendly and seem a little bothered if you customize your order.</Text>

Terrible food terrible service. The worst fast food dump in the AV and quite possibly the entire state of California. If you value your tastebuds and your health, stay far far away.
Call in the HAZMAT team, bulldoze the place to the ground. The world will be a better place. ..< /Text>

This place is not only slow, it's disgusting.

On a recent Friday night a friend wanted some quick Taco Bell. As we pulled up, the drive thru was packed. So we went inside

The reason the drive through was so busy?

The only reason I could figure is, the place smelled like a bathroom! And in not a nice way. That smell when it seems like the sewer is backing up and coming out thru the toilet.

My friend commented about it to the counter person. She just looked at us with a blank stare.

How can a food prep place smell like a backed up sewer? I've been in porta pottys that smell better.

Perhaps the selection of fast food is slim to none in rosamond. But no way would I ever go back. Not even in the drive thru. Food served in a place that filthy is disgusting.

Pass.</Text>

Service was very slow and the cheesy gordita was a waste of money.  The "cheesy" part had just a couple sprinkles of cheese and it was cold.  Couldn't take back because I was well dosn the expressway already.< /Text>

I don't go to this place often, but when I do the staff is not very friendly. The food isn't that good and the freshness is hit and miss.< /Review>

Sat in here for 35 minutes after my order. Finally a worker asks if I'm waiting for something. I then showed her my receipt and demanded a refund. This place is a joke.< /Text>

Really like the food. always have to go back for napkins or hot sauce. After giving order your order is Repeated before your next word comes out. Usually wrong. You ask for Large mountain dew original. They ask baja blast. You say, no original. They repeat. At the window they hand you baja blast.  Never get full order, something missing. Very nice polite people though.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Yesterday I was in his restaurant, and they took me more than half an hour to give me my order and for two burritos suppressed chicken, and when I claimed my food, the person who was making the burritos assured me that he had given them to me, that it was not dead They had never given them to me, because they made me of Mála gana and gave me four chicken pebbles in each burritos that also cost five dollars each I found very expensive for some bean burritos no more

(Original)
Ayer estuve en su restaurante , y me demoraron en darme mi pedido mas de media hora y por dos burritos suprimi de pollo, y a demás cuando reclamé mi comida , la persona que estaba haciendo los burritos aseguró que me los había dado, que no era siertoo nunca me los habían dado, pues me los hizo de Mála gana  y me dio con cuatro piedritas de pollo en cada burritos que además cuestan cinco dólares cada uno me pareció muy caro por unos burritos de frijoles no mas<//Text>
