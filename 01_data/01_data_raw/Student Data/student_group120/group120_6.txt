I was really happy to find this dentists office, the hygienist, and the dentist were great.  I only wish they took my insurance going forward.  Highly recommend.</Text>

<text>Dr. Lim and Dr. Aziz, the new Doctors that helped make going to the dentists much more enjoyable! I’m usually so terrified and just plain hate going to the dentist. All of that changed once I met these two. They are both amazing and pleasant. Not only do they ask about my teeth but, also about how I am doing.  I have created a bond with these dentists and I trust them with my dental needs. I don’t ever feel pressured into doing any dental work needed, when I do have work done it is easy as pie! I have a huge fear of needles, and needless to say I don’t feel anything at all! Thank you Diablo Dental Group!</text>< pics>

Dr. Aziz and Dr. Lim are the unique blend of professional and compassionate. Not only are they skilled at their craft, they are incredibly honest. They care about their patients and the health of their teeth and beyond! Dr. Aziz has a soft touch and was able to do a filling on my squirmy then 3 year old with absolutely no issue. She's great with kids and adults alike. I know most people dislike the dentist, but these two make it enjoyable! Their hygienists are great as well.</text>

I wish I hadn’t waited so long to go to Dr. Koetel! I heard years ago that he was great, he’s done AMAZING work on my husbands teeth, and yesterday was my first appointment with him. He was very thorough, answered every question and more, went over pictures of each tooth and a plan to correct my issues. He even asked questions about how well I sleep because of how my past dental work can cause sleep apnea. He even gave me simple, inexpensive fixes to start with. He didn’t chastise me for not flossing enough, very personable guy with state of the art equipment, and one of my friends who is in the business of making crowns for East bay dentists said that his margins are the cleanest, most precise she’s ever seen.</Text>

I highly recommend The Diablo Dental Group!  I have been going there for 7 years and recently had the privilege to experience the practice with Dr. Aziz Elrashidy and Dr. Lim.  During this COVID environment, they have additional ventilation, cleaning, and lobby policies to make me feel comfortable that I was safe. Along with the cleanliness, they were very thorough in their examination and cleaning to ensure any potential issues are identified.  I left my visit feeling special and fully taken care of.<//review>

He and his staff exhibit a genuine caring about me as a person and me as a patient.  Everyone makes the time to insure that each person knows they are appreciated as they work towards the goal of dental health to the point of only needing maintenance.

<Text>Most people dread going to the dentist. I don’t. I look forward to seeing Dr. Koeltl every time!  He is always gentle and kind. But alas, he has taken such good care of my teeth that I hardly get to see him anymore!  He pops in to say hello when I get my teeth cleaned (thank you Janee) and praises me for taking care of my teeth. The office staff and everyone in this place makes me feel like “Norm”.... where everybody knows my name.  Thanks to all of you for being my dental care family!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Review>Dr. Koeltl has been my dentist for so many years I forget when I first started going to him! He is extremely knowledgeable and constantly researching anything related to dental health so he can be on the forefront of the latest procedures. He has become a good friend, and he and his staff always treat me like visiting royalty. Every decision we have made about my teeth has been the right one, and at 70, I have complete faith in him, and bet that my teeth may even outlast me! A good dentist is so important to your overall health. I give him the highest recommendation I could possibly give.< /Review>< Time>

<rating>5< /rating><review>I’ve been from dentist to dentist. Searching for one experienced like I’ve had years ago. However, I work in Danville, CA and decided to look for a dentist around the area to make traveling easier for me. I found a dentist that looked professional on the internet (Diablo Dental Group)and decided to give it a go. The ladies that helped me were professional, they knew what they were doing. I was called in the lady that helped me knew how to do X-rays I didn’t gag. Dr. Koelti (dentist) was great, he knew what he was doing. He even referred other dentists to me to help get the work done. He even fixed one of my tooth 🦷 and made it look whole. I went back smiling all day waiting for my cleaning next week. In other word, if you need a dentist and your in Danville, CA call “The Diablo Dental Group” and ask to be seen by Dr. Koelti. I’m positive that you will like him for yourself, family and friends. Thank you Dr. Koelti!!!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Dr Koeltl's work is truly top notch and is worth the 2 hour drive I make to know my teeth will be fixed correctly. I have had a number of crowns done here with not a single issue or problem. I consider Dr Koeltl not just an amazing dentist but a friend I can count on. His staff is pleasure to be around and I appriciate them and how they treat me as well.<//text>< pics>

They each have had the opportunity to save their own money and time on dental work they've performed for me—by settling for less than perfection. However, they refused to take short cuts. They made it right even if it cost the practice real money. This speaks to the integrity and professionalism of The Diablo Dental Group.

My teeth, gums and mouth have never been healthier in my relatively long life!

Everyone at the practice is friendly, yet professional.  I never feel rushed and know I can always ask questions about procedures, insurance, and treatment schedule.  I tell everyone I know who is looking for a dentist to come to my dentist.  They won't be disappointed.  I'm your basic cavity/crown kinda guy, but I know that I wanted invisalign or dentures, they would take great care of me.  I drive in from Hayward because they are that good.<//review>

I came over because my hygienist recommended Dr. Kotel to me.  I really like the office and how my new hygienist  treats me, especially since I have a gag problem.  My old hygienist even comes in from time to time.  Only complaint is that office staff likes to reschedule your appointments a lot ( or at least with me).

I recently started seeing Dr. Koeltl and at our first meeting I knew he was someone I could trust to do the best work on my teeth.  He took the time to educate me on all my options, and at the end of the consultation I felt comfortable with his plan for all my restorations and cosmetic work.  His staff is so welcoming, and I look forward to a very long relationship with Dr. Koeltl and his staff.</text>

I really love this dental office. Everyone I've ever encountered that worked here has been exceptional, especially Dr. Hong. Easy-going, fun and listens to my concerns. Although I'm at a dentist appointment, I've always enjoyed being there because of him, Jan his assistant and the rest of the staff.
I started going to Diablo Dental about 5 or 6 years ago to be treated for my severe TMJ. Dr. Hong's expertise reversed my problem and I'm now pain free. I liked him and the practice so much that I switched dentists and drive from Concord to be seen by him.
I would and have recommended this dental office to my family and friends without hesitation.< /Text>

My first visit to Dr. Valerie Johnston was 10 years ago.  I moved to another city and needed to find a dentist closer to where I lived.  I moved back to Danville and was happy to find her practicing dentistry with the Diablo Dental Group.< /text>

My wife & I have traveling from Concord to see Dr. Johnston for many years, because she always gives 110%.  We have gotten to know the staff & Dr. Koeltl over the years, and they are equally friendly & professional.  I highly recommend Diablo Dental.<//Text>

I truly enjoyed visiting Diablo Dental Group, which says a lot because going to the doctor isn't always a pleasant experience.. Dr. Gregory Hong and his staff were always friendly and put a smile on my face every time I came in for my appointment. Although my TMJ issue isn't completely solved (and it probably won't be because there is no cure), I was fitted for a splint, which I still wear as often as possible, and learned a lot about my condition and how to help it in little ways every day myself. I appreciate Dr. Hong's patience and listening skills when he explained to me how and why my jaw moves the way it does.
I would recommend Diablo Dental Group and Dr. Hong specifically for anyone's dental needs because they truly care and want to help you. They do not hurry your appointment and dismiss your concerns. They are great listeners and very comfortable and fun to be around, as far as doctors go! :)< /Text>

<Text>We stayed at Poinsettia Palms in Corona Del Mar for a month with another couple, and it was a wonderful experience. Throughout our entire stay, the property manager, Phil, was extremely responsive and helpful, as well as kind and professional. He went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our stay. I even left something behind, and he was kind enough to find it and send it to me right away. The house itself is amazing - great outdoor spaces, parking, and nice appliances (washer/dryer, dishwasher, TVs, AC, etc.). The kitchen is stocked with cookware, dishes, and drinkware. You could tell that it was professionally cleaned right before we arrived. The house is in a great location- walking distance to the beach, Crystal Cove State Park (great for runs or walks on the beach), restaurants, grocery store, post office, coffee, you name it. The neighborhood is also clean, and felt very safe. Highly recommend and would stay here again!<//Text><date>1606853439878</date><rate>5<//rate>< Gmap_id>

<text>I also would give 0 stars if possible. I booked the Magic Sands #111 for 5 nights on the Big Island of Hawaii and upon arrival was disappointed to learn there’s no AC in this unit, the pool is under construction, and the unit was not well cleaned upon arrival — sand was remaining from a prior guest on numerous surfaces. So much for C-19 protocol.

Grand Welcome never advised of the first 2 issues and stated that if AC is not mentioned, it’s not provided (consumer beware). They had no awareness of the pool situation and never offered alternate properties to right the situation. They only offered a “courtesy gesture” of a $125 refund.

I am still disputing this situation so hope my review will help someone else steer clear of this company.

Such poor customer relations and dispute resolution, no concept of what “customer delight” could look like. They won’t even call to discuss, all communication has been via txt. Just not a professional operation!

As of 12/4/20, I’ve yet to receive final resolution.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

After searching for weeks and weeks on rental sites my wife and I found the perfect property in Lake Tahoe.  We have been looking forward to this trip since Feb when we booked the house.  Now, days after asking for the balance on the property, they ripped it out from under us.  Said the owner is no longer putting the house for rent.  So, be warned...you may have the perfect vacation planned, only for them to take the house away from you with very little notice.< /Review>

Such a scam. Refused to give us our money back when we had to cancel our trip to Hawaii because of COVID-19.  After MUCH back-and-forth, explaining our circumstances,  they finally gave us a "gift voucher" to use by April 2021. They have ZERO empathy. The property we originally booked was then suddenly "unavailable" because it was under renovation until July 2021. So now we are trying to find somewhere else to go. But inventory is SO minimal. Maybe because there is a worldwide pandemic?!  And a property that says $200/night is also suddenly $350/night??? As a small business owner myself, I understand times are tough. But there is a human component to the madness these days. Families are also struggling.  I do not want to feel forced to go on a vacation. So now we are out $2,400+. THUMBS DOWN</review>

Had  difficulty getting  into the gated community as well as the rental property as I  was sent the wrong codes. After several calls to Grand Welcome , the local property manger had to come to the property to let me  into the rental.  The decor  was lovely , wonderful beds and the  only  disappointment  were the 2  shower/ tubs. Slippery tile when wet and  very difficult  to climb into the shower/ tub and it was impossible for me to use the master shower with a huge step down with no  step stool  . I did go purchase rubber bath mats for  showers  as well as non slip bath rugs on the tile floors in all the bathrooms . If one has a handicap  I would not recommend  this  property because of  the bath facilities. The owners  were thoughtful with luggage racks, many  hangers and  the basics in the kitchen . There is no TV in the living room , although each bedroom had a huge  well channeled TV  with  Netflix etc.

The area  was lovely and peaceful , unfortunately  the fire pit was not  working . I  would  return to the rental especially  knowing  the few glitches .The  2  months I was there, felt like home and a quiet , peaceful gated  community  !</Text>

<Text>My family and I booked a much needed cabin getaway in Donnelly, Idaho. Because of recent forest fires in the area and hazardous air quality, I requested a itinerary change for a later available date when fire season would be over. I was immediately denied and told they couldn’t work with me.  Instead of having a potential repeat customer, they would rather make these short sighted “business decisions.” Take your vacation money else where! 👎🏻<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>My friends and I booked a cabin for Xmas days at Mammooth end of November. After a few days the new stay at home order of California got issued and  all short term rentals got cancelled.

Grand Welcome didn’t communicate with us but with rather he to reach them to figure out what’s happening.

Most importantly, they charged us the cleaning fees (~200$) + 5% cancellation fees for a cancelation that we were not responsible for. Worst customer experience ever, they were not responsive at all.

We stayed in Corona Del Mar and had a wonderful time at the rental right at the beach. Beautiful place and location. Very easy to book, great communication and even got a discount. I accidentally left my iPad and when contacting PointBreak, Phil found it and got back to me right away. Phil was extremely helpful, very friendly and responded right away. Mailed it to me the very next day. Would highly recommend Phil and hope to work with him again in the future.< /text>

We stayed at a Grand Welcome rental house in South Lake Tahoe. The place was comfortable and exactly as advertised. It was a short drive to Sierra-at-Tahoe and also to Heavenly. There were plenty of dishes and pots and pans in the kitchen and quite a few spices and oils for cooking. We were able to put our car in the small garage every night. They sent a code for the front door via email and text. No problems at all, just a great family trip!<//Text>

This company and staff cares more about their own pockets than the safety of their guests - in relation to the Mammoth fire that lasted for more than a month. Will report to BBB. PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS WITH THIS ESTABLISHMENT.

My family and I booked a family getaway through Airbnb and this is by the worst experience I ever had in regards to getting a refund or changing the dates.

My family and I booked for Sept 11th-13th (Friday to Sunday) but we weren't able to go because of the Mammoth fire that started on Sept 4th (Friday). We were hopeful that the fire would die down and wouldn't interfere with our trip. The fire was less than 1% contained heading into Monday and we wanted to cancel/reschedule because the fire was spreading and I didn't want my family to be in an area where we could have smoke inhalation - we have family members that's over 65, a pregnant cousin, and different families coming in different directions, which the roads were impacted because of the smoke. We attempted to reschedule via Airbnb but they kept telling us that we would have to get in contact with the resort to reschedule/cancel.

When I got in contact with the receptionists at Grand, she stated that they can't refund us since it's within 60 days of the check in date. We booked 15 days before the trip. I asked if we could reschedule at least to a later date and she said we have to contact Airbnb. I questioned her but decided to go through Airbnb. When I contacted Airbnb, they routed me back to Grand and the new person wouldn't reschedule or cancel my rental. My family and I are down $2,300 that we have to pay even though we pleaded that we didn't want to risk our family driving through these conditions and being comfortable with the horrible air quality. This company cares more about money than even compromising with its guest and rescheduling.

I will never recommend this place to anyone. I would have been fine and relieved to reschedule to a safer date, but because of their guidelines, a natural disaster will not protect you.

Response to the owners comment:
Impossible. I'm in the system because I booked through Airbnb for those dates I provided. I'm not going through the same runaround continuing this horrible experience. I contested with my bank to ask for a refund or reschedule, and you denied both of my requests because it didn't fit your criteria. How do you expect a family to risk their lives during a huge fire? Would you let your family do that?<//Review>

Two blow dryers that quit working after about 20 seconds.
There were no instructions as to how to use the fireplace, tv, audio, nor hot tub.  It was difficult to reach them on the phone, although they were quick to respond to an email.  An urgent problem went unfixed.  The master bath shower drained slowly at first, then not at all.  Three calls and two days without any resolution.

It was the first big snow of the season and once we had settled into the condo, it was apparent that the heater wasn’t working properly. We decided to call in for assistance since it was almost 5pm. Very shortly someone arrived with enough space heaters to warm the place until maintenance could check it out. To our surprise, the repair guy showed up that night! The problem was quickly fixed and there were no further issues.  There was plenty of space for our family and it was nice for each bedroom to have its own bathroom. The garage was greatly appreciated! Our car was safely out of the accumulating snow so no digging out for us. We were worried about the beds (we had heard they were hard). The mattresses are actually very good quality, felt like memory foam, on the firm side but worked great for us. Overall we had an exceptional time and would highly recommend Grand Welcome - They were exactly that!<//text><Rate>5</Rate><Gmap_id>0x80dd4bb3f478b09d:0xcdcc24e0f6697ca9<//Gmap_id>< pics>

5 Stars!!!! We had a wonderful time at this Adorable Cozy Cabin!!   We went to a nearby  hiking spot that was  only a 2 min drive , called Eagle Rock!  When we reached the top it was the most incredible view I've seen.  There is also an awesome pizza place right down the street in walking distance, and then a few miles down is a fantastic restaurant on the lake,  named Sunnyside. We were relaxed,slept great, had a blast and the cabin was perfectly clean. Definitely recommend this cabin!! We will for sure go back!!!</Text>

We were so excited to have a vacation in Lake Tahoe and thought we found the perfect mountain cabin. When described a a “quiet” location perfect for a little staycation we thought we were all set. Upon arrival we noticed the next door property sectioned off with construction tape and orange dots (Red Flag!) on a dozen+ trees all along the property line....Tall! Huge, mature pine trees! A few days in, it happened - 8am. Chainsaws, wood chipper, 150 ft crane, bobcat, workers shouting   We had no warning this was happening that day.  No one said “better move your cars”. What a disaster. NOISE! Dirt, dust, debris flying all over our “quiet” cabin and cars. Needless to say upon my return home I had to clean my car and was told I had dried sap covering the  e n t I r e  car requiring extensive sap removal.

So in short, Grand Welcome says they are not responsible for what happened next door. Not their property, not their problem. EXCUSE ME, they said I had to look forward to a quiet cabin in the woods! They never mentioned construction. “We didn’t know” they say... Sorry, they need to be current on what is actually happening at their properties and not claim ignorance as an excuse. So disappointing!!!<//Review>

California beach life at its best. Being in a gated community but still by the beach is a huge plus.
We loved walking the beach in the morning and evening and watching the spectacular sunsets from the terrace. Going to sleep and waking to the sound of the sea was simply amazing; add to that the most comfortable beds we’ve ever experienced in a vacation home! All in all this is a well equipped and excellently located dream rental home.< /review>

If I could give them negative stars I would. We booked a family vacation in Tahoe. My daughter and I tested positive for COVID and we didn’t even want to cancel our reservation we just wanted to reschedule it and they kept declining. After trying to fix this issue for 2 days, they finally sent an email stating that they will not reschedule due to their cancellation policy. The contract never said anything about rescheduling. They never contacted the owners of property. They didn’t care at all that we had covid they would prefer for us to go to the property sick rather than to just reschedule us. So disappointed with their customer service and how they handled the situation. In the end, Airbnb gave us a full refund due to the circumstances and we will never ever go through grand welcome again. We also plan on contacting the news with South Lake Tahoe to let them know that they would prefer to contaminate South Lake Tahoe than to simply reschedule us to a different weekend. They do not care about any COVID protocols so do not book with them! By far the worst experience they should be ashamed.< /Text>

<review>If I could give Grand Welcome zero stars, I would. I booked a trip to Mammoth, however, due to the fires going on, I had to cancel. I reached out to GW to ask for a full refund, and they refused. They stated they had a strict policy. I told them I understood the policy, but that I had to cancel due to the fires going on. GW stated that although recreational activities were canceled, the roads were open and that people were still checking in. I told them that the roads being open, means nothing. No recreational activities were open and not to mention the air quality. When I first reached out to GW, Mammoth was not letting non-residents go, and GW still refused to give a full refund. They only returned $288, the cleaning fee, out of $970 that I paid! Again, I told them I had to cancel, there was no other option. During this  pandemic, I, like so many others have been affected, mentally and financially. This trip was supposed to be a time to relax and de-stress, however, they have caused more stress, they are heartless and money hungry. Please don’t waist your money with this company!<//review>< Rate>

We really enjoyed the location of the unit.  Sunsets were great, surfers were entertaining to watch.  We used the kitchen every day for breakfast and lunch, we found it to be well equipped.  Furnishings were comfortable and didn't appear to be worn out.  I found the bed in the master bedroom to be very comfortable.  Bathrooms were great with plenty of towels.  Some odds and ends that we found were very nice like beach chairs, snorkel gear, and a beach umbrella (the umbrella was a mess and needs replaced).

On the negative side . . . 1) The lighting in the kitchen is either REALLY bright or off.  We replaced bulbs in the range hood so we could have a nightlight (both bulbs were burnt out).  2) The sliding shutters between the bedroom and living room were dirty -- badly needed dusting (or worse).  3) For the air conditioning to be effective in the unit, we had to keep sliding shutters open and a fan circulating the air.  We were expecting to be able to close the shutters to have some privacy in that bedroom but that made the air conditioning ineffective in the rest of the unit.  4) There were two fans in the unit but we were only able to get one to work.

Overall, we enjoyed the unit and if we choose to return to The Big Island we would definitely consider this unit again.</review>

I would not rent/hire from a company that still offers their properties when there is a shelter-in-place in California.   Where's your social responsibility Grand Welcome?  Encouraging people to travel while there's a pandemic clearly shows the company's values.<//Text>

<Review>Our Tahoe stay was great. The house is very comfortable and spacious with 3 outdoor decks that allowed for star gazing at night and glimpses of the lake during the day.  The kitchen is well equipped and with 4 full bedrooms our family all had places to sleep and have space to relax. The residential setting is quiet and the neighborhood is very nice which was important to us. You are a short drive to Kings Beach and all that Lake Tahoe has to offer. We look forward to returning again!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The house is beautiful and the setup is perfect for the 11 in our family that joined this trip. A nice property with two large decks off the back (would be extra great if there was patio furniture and a grill). The kids (and the parents too) have really enjoyed the arcade machine in the game room. The furniture is very nice and comfortable as are the beds.

This house seems fairly new or recently renovated but is not as well equipped as other houses we have rented. We were only provided with 9 bath towels, 4 hand towels and 4 washcloths for 11 guests and as much as we searched through the house we could not find any extra. Pots and pans were minimal and a bit small trying to cook for a party of 11.We also could not find any potholders or dish cloths anywhere in the house. When we called the management company they were not very helpful and said potholders and dish towels were not provided with the contract. Seemed strange to us as these are not items we would have thought to bring (plus there was a drawer clearly labeled for them but it was empty) - made making dinner that night a little challenging.

Another note - lots of stairs in this house with the main living space at the top. Likely not a problem for most but we had 2 sets of grandparents with us (coupled with the altitude was a bit of a climb).

Although neighbors are closer than expected, it is a very quiet neighborhood and very relaxing.<//Review>< name>

Everything about our stay was exceptional. We booked this for a family Christmas trip and wanted a home that would help to create a memorable experience.  We arrived to music playing softly in a warm and inviting atomosphere.  The home was well equipped with everything that we needed to have a very comfortable and enjoyable stay.  Ultimately from the moment we reserved the home to the moment we locked up to leave, we were happy.</review>

<Text>My friends and I had a great time. The kitchen was a big enough space for us to cook. The utensils that we needed were all there in the kitchen. The beds were comfortable to sleep in. Entertainment systems and games were fun to play with. The house was a good distance from the grocery store and the lake.

It would be nice if there were extra blankets and bath towels. That is the only thing I would add. For some reason, We had trouble turning on the TV in the living room, so we weren’t able to use that. Those were the only concerns that we had. Everything else was great!

Thank you so much for letting my friends and I stay at your property. It made our weekend getaway more relaxing and enjoyable.<//Text>< pics>

This was a great way to use a wonderful home for a special occasion. Grand Welcome provided clear and easy to use directions on finding and getting into the house. There was one problem during our stay and it was corrected swiftly. I would not hesitate to use this company again.<//Review>

<Text>The location is good. Just out of town traffic and within walking distance to the Keauhou shopping center, and farmers market on Saturday, as well as the Keauhou bay where you can catch a snorkel excursion, it also has a nice pool and sunset views. The place is well equipped, lots of kitchen tools and gadgets, chairs for the beach and towels and, the bed is comfy but, don’t look to close or you will see that everything is a bit worn and shabby. If you are looking for luxury, look elsewhere but, if you are looking for a good value, I think it fits the bill.< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNwMB9NT1ENYufNtmrxYr3pmrOv4MXzDOiNPDCW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><response>{'time': 1584021452394, 'text': "Hello Cynthia, thanks for leaving us such a kind review!

< Review>
The home and grounds were beautiful and comfortable! The view from the back patio was unforgettable.   My family had such a great experience!  Thank you!

The only small negative was that the stove fan did not work. We called the number for reporting this and they said they would come by to check it out. However, they did not. This wasn’t a big deal to us though. .< /Review>

A couple of minor reasons it doesn’t get a 5 star.
But first of all, the location is beyond perfect. Right on the ocean (our unit). You can’t get much closer. The sunsets are picture perfect.
The unit was clean and large for my family of 5.
Minutes to a great snorkeling beach and 10 minutes to Kona.
Why not 5 stars?
It could need a couple of updates. For example the top rack in the dishwasher is broken (but we were able to adjust it). And some of the screen doors could need a refresh. Very minor stuff to be honest.
If you’re OK without a/c you’ll love this unit. I kinda like a/c, but it does cool down decently enough at night without it.

Overall a very nice unit and complex. Highly highly recommend.< /review>

<review>When you look for a vacation home on Airbnb, the pictures are what we go by first, then the reviews and of course the final cost. So let's start with the pictures. The details on the listing are all on point. The home is very clean, modern look and feel. Clean bathrooms with clean towels provided. Well stocked kitchen for all the home chef needs. They even provided a propane tank if you would like to have a BBQ.
We were a group of 9 friends and 2 kids. The bedroom's were perfect for our little group and everyone were comfortable.
The home has a decent internet connection to satisfy all your basic online needs. To entertain your group they have a pool table as well. Maybe some more room around the pool table would be nice as the space can get a little restricted. But then again we came to the Tahoe to be in the outdoors.
Heavenly is about a 15 min drive from the house so you can head out there to really enjoy some of the best that Tahoe has to offer.
Cost wise I think we got a very decent deal and having a group of about 10 people will be a little easy on the pocket as long as everyone chips in.
Overall I recommend this home and the company that manages the home for the customer service and for all the information they provide you before and while you are on your stay.</review>< time>

So far, we are being directed into Gualala, 15 miles one way, to check in.  This is beyond our destination and then will need to drive back to the house.  I wish that would have been mentioned before we rented.< /review>

This townhouse is gorgeous & very well equipped & kept up.   So nice to have 2 lanais & 1 with a gas grill.  Pool & hot tub are very nice & an easy walk from our unit.  Shopping center  is a super short drive away.  We will definitely return on future trips to the Big Island!  Best part is the owners actually live(d) in the next city away from us in Michigan!< /Review>

<Name>Randy Arnold< /Name><review>The Sea Village Resort is quiet and the grounds nicely landscaped. The ocean view from our balcony is beautiful and the perfect place to relax and enjoy the sunset. The pool area is conveniently located and well maintained. The location of this condo resort is an easy walk to the shops, restaurants and entertainment. The reason for designating a three-star rating is because of some issues my wife and I had with the general maintenance of this unit. We are not overly picky with our lodging needs, but a few comments need to be shared. The unit itself is somewhat dated, which is fine, but problems exist relating to the age and upkeep. Upon our arrival, the power breaker for the bedroom electrical outlets was not working. We called the Sea Village maintenance office and a service rep arrived in a timely manner. After inspecting the breaker box, he stated an electrician would need to handle the problem. Service was provided the next day. It was frustrating to read a guest review describing this same problem with the breaker box. In order to have electricity in the bedroom our first night, we headed to Walmart and purchased an extension cord and power surge plus a box fan. The patio door doesn’t lock, the screen door to the entrance needs repair, and one side of the bedroom windows would not open. We banked on not needing a/c in February but after Day 1, regretted renting a unit without a/c. Even though the unit has two ceiling fans (living room and bedroom) plus two floor fans (only one fan was working), it was difficult to cool down the interior space by early-afternoon. The bedroom was too warm for sleeping. We had stayed in Maui the week prior at a comparably priced unit offering many more amenities and it was well maintained.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>If I could leave zero stars I would. We have a reservation for Oct 2020. Hawaii has a 2 week quarantine restriction right now and travel is limited. I have been working with this company since April to see what can be done and they are absolutely horrible to work with. They will not budge on their contract and non refundable fees amidst all the world issues. They just want to "politely" say "sorry this is not my problem...kiss off." DONT BOOK with this company if there is any chance of a global pandemic, job loss, financial crisis and hell breaking loose. They don't care!</Text><Name>Jess Perry<//Name><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< gmap_id>

The rental was nice and there were no issues with the house. I did find it a little awkward that there were personal/family photos up in the bedrooms which I thought was a little weird. If a house is going to be listed as a vacation rental I do think they shouldn’t have any personal/family pictures up.< /review>

Location is very good (Juniper Springs). Bed in bedroom was pretty good, no complaints there. Otherwise not good. We were there for 4 days. No change of towels. The towels we got on day one are what we had to the end. Kitchen had no spices (not even salt), dishwasher no detergent.</review>

I booked with Grand Welcome in Hawaii for a stay, May 2020. I knew within 60 days of travel that COVID restrictions were not going to allow travel. I cancelled. They are unwilling to reimburse any of the almost $3000 that I paid for the rental due to a 90 day policy for cancellation. This is totally unacceptable business. I would not book with them. Very unprofessional. I totally understand the 90 day refund policy, however we are in unprecedented times and they certainly could have allowed a refund. Even partial. VERY frustrating to simply be out this money.

Edited....
Grand Welcome has allowed me to book for 2021 at the same place (likely still will not happen due to coronavirus I’m sure)....
However, I have to pay $900 MORE for the week. Due to increased prices for 2021.

Choices are:
1. Lose all money. No refund.
2. Book same place for 2021 and pay $900 more.

Really?
Isn’t that price gouging?
Crazy.<//Text>

<Gmap_id>0x80dd4bb3f478b09d:0xcdcc24e0f6697ca9<//Gmap_id><Review>Where do I begin?  First of all, when we got the the rental home, it was obvious that the home hasn't been cleaned in a very, very long time.  There were spider webs and LIVE spiders in EVERY sink, tubs, toilets and the garage had so many spiders, it was scary to go into the garage.  There were also spider webs on the walls in every downstairs bedrooms.  My daughter, her husband and grand daughters (both age 5) wouldn't even use the downstairs bathroom because of all the spiders.  You know they have a problem with spiders because in every closet or cabinet, there was a can of raid.  Maybe you need to check on an exterminator.  My husband had to clean the all the bathrooms because we are all afraid of spiders. Also, the dirt was so thick on every ceiling fan in the house, we couldn't use them at all.  You especially need ceiling fans in the summer time.  The toilets haven't been cleaned in a long time either.  The showers didn't drain well and the master shower leaked really bad when you took a shower.  It wasn't very pleasant to go into a home and have to clean it.  I thought that was the reason you charged a cleaning fee.  When I called about all these issues, they checked the cleaning log and said the house hasn't been cleaned in a long time.  If the house had been cleaned before we got there, we really wouldn't have had any issues.  I was told, we were in the mountains and we should expect to have spiders.  That's not true, we rented another house in South Lake Tahoe and we didn't see any spiders or bugs for that fact.   Amy, Property Manager and a maintenance guy came with her to fix the drain and the shower as best as he could.  A cleaning crew came and my son in law and husband told them to go ahead and go in, we were leaving in about 15 minutes, but the guy got back into his truck and left.  Then the cleaning crew told Amy we told him to leave.  That was NOT true.  Also, let's talk about how many spider bites we got while staying there.  I alone had six, five on one arm and one on my back.  My son in law had several also.  Thank the good Lord that they didn't bite my pregnant daughter or granddaughters.  My granddaughters called it the spider house.  Obviously, we will never stay in this home again and I will NOT rent another home from Grand Welcome, because you did NOTHING to alleviate this problem.  The house should have been cleaned before we got there, PERIOD!!!</Review><resp>None<//resp>< time>

<Text>I would not recommend Blue Basque Home.  It could be a nice house, but it is neglected.  The house has been for sale for over a year, and my guess is owner doesn't want to put any money into it.  There is no window treatment in master bedroom so anybody in the living room has a direct line of site into the bedroom.   Most of the appliances did not work well.  We had to hand wash dishes, and only run the clothes washer when nobody was in the house (it made the dishes rattle).  No toaster, only a toaster oven.  Pots and pans are ancient and very worn out.  Water in all faucets was either scalding hot or cold.  Nearly impossible to get anything inbetween.   On the plus side - the beds were comfy.</Text>< UserId.>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>This is our second time at the Surf and Racquet Club and the first time in Unit 3-201.  We just loved it.  It has been recently updated and looks very bright and clean.  The unit is well appointed with everything we needed including beach/pool gear, cooking equipment, and a very comfy bed.  The view is outstanding with a sunset every night.  We also appreciated the easy access to beaches and shopping.  This is really a great location and a great condo unit.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

< Review>
Working with Grand Welcome was great.  We found a wonderful cabin at Zephyr Cove Lake Tahoe that fit our needs perfectly.  We were a family of two grandparents, two additional adults and 3 grandchildren.  The cabin had great sleeping accommodations for everyone.  Upon arrival the place was immaculate and well stocked with everything we needed including toilet paper, etc.  We only needed to bring our own food.  Grand Welcome did an excellent job of communicating at every point.  They gave us directions, told us what to expect, made sure a key to get in was available, and contacted us periodically asking if everything was OK .  Though we never had to use it there was always a number provided that we could contact should we have any questions.  All and all an excellent experience and we'll use their services again in the near future.<//Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>What a fantastic place! The house was perfect for our extended family gathering. There were plenty of seats for meals and the kitchen was well appointed with everything we needed. The views are stunning.
We went boating on Cascade Lake which was 3 minutes down the hill, enjoyed the pool and went mountain biking at the resort, sat in the hot tub on the deck, used the sauna, played pool and ping pong late into the evenings. We even went river-running about 30 mins away, and played two different golf courses. Trudy, the property manager was outstanding. This was one of our favorite trips!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80dd4bb3f478b09d:0xcdcc24e0f6697ca9< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

We really enjoyed our stay in your place, close to all things, would have liked to have some beach things to use like chairs or cooler, but the towels were beautiful! Room was big enough for us and having a place to park was very nice, the fees at other places were way too much! We had a great time in Hawaii,.< /text>

We loved our stay in Truckee. We found the home to be very comfortable and Grand Welcome very responsive, hospitable, and professional. We thought we left our IPad behind at the rental on our departure and they sent someone out to search the rental. We did end up finding our iPad. A special thanks to Julian at Grand Welcome for all his assistance during our stay. Would recommend Grand Welcome.< /text>

The furniture is old and smelly and should be replaced; the rooms are smaller and much less appealing that the pictures suggest; the exception is the master, which is great (futon-type bed) and has a nice connecting room; and then there are all the extra charges that bring the price way above what is advertised.

<Text>Great customer service, answered all my questions & helped us with anything we needed. The staff in Mammoth accommodated us excellently, even delivering 2 window fans to help with the heat. We come to vacation in Mammoth every year, sometimes more than once a year, we will definitely use Grand Welcome again! We've already spread the word to family & friends! Thank you!</Text>< Pictures>

We had a great stay in the Cascade area.  The house was perfect for our family and the location great for the things we wanted to do.  The only complaint was that the house was not very clean.  The showers still had sand in them and the kitchen had a weird smell so we were leery of how well it had been cleaned prior to our arrival.  Otherwise a great stay in a great house for large families.< /text>

We stayed at Kona White Sands on Hawaï - the Big Island. It is a very attractive and well equipped condo with everything you need for a lovely stay. The beach is small and there are rocks, but it is just across the road and was very popular.</Text>

Wonderful cabin equipped with everything you need to make your stay enjoyable. A wide and current selection of boardgames, nice hot tub, home theater system and a cabinet full of toys for kids as well as dogs. A fully equipped kitchen as well. And the place is kept extremely neat and tidy. Close to all south lake  attractions and beaches as well as hikes.</Review>

<Review>Our vacation in Mammoth could have been a disaster. We drove for 8 hours and through snow to get here and found our Condo not ready. Local staff responded quickly and explained that needed repairs were scheduled for after the Holiday, but the contractor had jumped the gun. Within about 10 minutes they had transferred our booking to another similar (but better) Condo. Sometimes things go wrong - it’s how you respond that matters. No complaints.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

<Text>We had a wonderful time at the Grand Welcome Kona Reef D22 location.
Clean and well appointed for our needs, 5 adults and a toddler. This is the second time we’ve stayed at this beautiful location. I recommend this to anyone that wants family friendly, oceanfront accommodations that are a short walking distance to town.

Great prompt service too. I noticed the water filter replacement light on the fridge was lit and emailed to have it replaced. They sent someone to replace it the same day.

Love it.

(One tiny drawback is the master bedroom ensuite fan kept throwing the breaker. The service person showed us where the fuse box was, so we just reset it when it disconnected).</Text>< Gmap_id>

Great rental.  Great location.  Clean.  Very pleasant to have a view of trees and golfing greens out the great room picture windows.  Renters' duties upon departure were very low hassle.

Minor complaints are that the gas stove was in continual sparking/lighting mode when in use, the bedding for the sleep sofas in the loft was hard to find, and several windows had non-functional blinds or no blinds.  Nevertheless, would gladly rent this unit again.<//review>

Our entire experience with Grand Welcome was fantastic. Clear and regular communications helped ease the whole process and left us questioning nothing. The house was simply great and as advertised. Checkin was very simple. And they even went above and beyond by helping us get a package delivered back to us! Overall, can't say enough.<//Review>

<Review>The house is clean and well laid out.  Rooms are arranged to maximize the lovely ocean view. The hot tub appears relatively new and functions well. The kitchen is stocked with enough plates, cups, glasses for a gathering of a dozen or more. The indoor seating accommodateso six people comfortably, but there is a picnic table near the hot tub and three bar stools. We would happily return to this house.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80dd4bb3f478b09d:0xcdcc24e0f6697ca9< /gmap_id></record>

We booked and stayed at a resort on the Big Island managed by Grand Welcome.  It exceeded our expectations - unit is clean and beautiful upon arrival.  Very well equipped - comes with W/D, full kitchen complete with cooking oil, beach chairs and even cooler bags which are necessities for Hawaii.

Best of all, we saved $120 booking directly with Grand Welcome for the same exact unit vs airBnb.  Win-win.</Review>

<Text>We rent their house in South Lake Tahoe. It shows the house has fireplace on Airbnb , but when we checked in, we found it didn't work. They said the fireplace wouldn't be usable during our stay.  My kids were not happy about that. They agreed to refund $25 per night to us, but they never actually did that and even stop replying my email. They still put fireplace in its amenities now even they know that the fireplace is not usable .

There were lots of spider webs on the ceiling of living room . The basement was cold even we set the temperature at 80 degree. We can also see carpet stain in basement.

Its backyard was good. The kids loved playing snow ball and on ice.

Overall, I won't rent their house any more.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< date>

<text>The house was very comfortable and I loved having two porches--facing east and west. However, there was no hot water in the bathroom. I selected this house partly because of the jetted tub and was so looking forward to a soak, but instead, I had to wash up in the kitchen sink.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Name>

AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

I had a confirmed reservation here, and my friends had booked their flights after we locked down the vacation rental. Then, I received an email saying the reservation was canceled because of "maintenance issues" with the house. Fine - that's understandable. But then I'd expect to be offered a suitable replacement at the same cost. After several calls with their guest relations department, they weren't able to offer a suitable replacement.

I've emailed the CEO (Brandon Ezra) - will update this review if anything changes, but as of right now I am very dissatisfied.

I should've listened to all of the negative reviews here. STAY AWAY!!!<//Review>

<text>This fantastic location in Sea Ranch is a must-visit for those of you who wish to live like you do at home, only with a fabulous view of the ocean. Perched on a hill overlooking the beauty of the Pacific, you'll enjoy all of the kitchen items any gourmet would use in your own kitchen. This place is STOCKED full of all the proper utensils and devices one needs to make a meal of any kind...all while watching the ocean! There is a perfect propane grill out back for some fish you might pick up at the excellent Surf Market just up the road. (They have EVERYTHING!) The aesthetic here in the home is lovely with all of the right touches. Great beds in three bedrooms and three bathrooms with excellent showers. THIS IS A WINNER!<//text>< pictures>

At the pick up location the key was located in a combination locker of which the code is emailed to u with all the needed info about the Condo, including wifi codes, check in and check out times and what to do with the heater when checking out. As well as other information about the Condo.

Upon getting to the Condo it showed very clean. Condo came with all the kitchen utensils needed for cooking. Nice king-size bed. Had 2 sofa beds.  Had fire wood to use if wanted.

And since this particular set of Condo Units were at an intersection u had the choice of hopping on two different shuttles taking u to different mountain lodges to get to the slopes. Very convenient.

Only thing I found was that the previous occupants had left a couple items of clothes in one of the drawers.  I left the drawer open so that the items could be removed. I'm a little surprised though that I didn't receive a notification that something was left behind.</Text><user_id>100770989954702877065<//user_id>< Date>

Apartment itself was nice, but when we checked in there were no garbage bags whatsoever, they only provide a single load of detergent for the washing machine, and a tiny bottle of dish soap.  They sent me an automated email at check in to make sure everything is okay, to which I responded there were no bags, and didn’t hear back for 3 days.   The maintenance man then let himself in when we didn’t answer the door.  Incredibly weird.  I’m sorry, myself and no other guest is going to buy an entire box of detergent for 7 days.  Charge people $5 more and provide an acceptable level of service.<//text>

<review>The location to downtown Kona with shops and restaurants is perfect, easily walkable.  The accommodations were clean and orderly.  Kitchen well stocked with cooking essentials.  It is on the third floor with air conditioning only in one bedroom.  Therefore, very hot during the day.   If I had any plans of having one day to stay in and relax it would be difficult.  The loft bedroom is especially hot at night making sleep challenging if you are not used the climate.  That being said, most places are not air conditioned so this is probably to be expected.

There were a few minor areas in which improvements could be made.  The supply of beach equipment was old and worn down.  One of the snorkel masks was broken.  The beach chairs were perfectly usable but have seen better days. The upstairs bathroom could use some new towels and the drain in the sink replaced.  The showers both had some mildly irritating issues as well. Overall we enjoyed our stay here, but several small issues kept me from giving it a higher rating.<//review>< pictures>

< review>
I booked a vacation home with Grand Welcome in South Lake Tahoe.  Since I was over the 60 day time frame, they were to take 20% of the amount due from my account.  They took 50%.  When I called to ask why they took the higher amount, IT WAS THEN I was told the property wasn't available due to a collapsed deck.   Understandable.   Then I was told I had to wait 10 days to get my $ 1900 refunded on a home that shouldn't have been posted in the first place.  I just check this morning and the dates I wanted are still available for this property online.  I don't get it, Grand Welcome.  First you take 30% more out of my account then you tell me the house isn't an option and I have to wait 10 days to get my money back.  Also, you aren't allowed to talk to a manager according to the service staff that answers.  Never again.</review>

We stayed in Corona Del  Mar and had a fabulous  experience. The villa was very confortable for all the family, and super design, balconies had stunning view over the sea, we could even see dolphins!! Phil, the manager of the location did everything for us to have a great time. He did a fantastic job with all our requests, a big thank you to him!! We definitely consider coming back.

<review>I regularly book through Grand Welcome when visiting the Big Island of Hawaii.  They always ensure the apartment is clean and adequately stocked with everything we need for the duration of our trip.  It can be a bit of gamble to book accommodations online, but I've never had any regrets.  They always make me feel like I'm walking into my home away from home.<//review>< Pics>

Great location.  Clean, comfortable with beautiful view.  The place needed a little TLC.  Many lights out, broken coffee maker, fire alarm beeping when we arrived.  The weekends in July are very crowded in town and on the public beach in front of condo.  We were glad we had our private roped off area of beach to ourselves.<//Text>

<Text>The location of this condo and the condo itself was great. The description of this unit specifically stated each of the bedrooms downstairs had their own bathrooms. This was not the case. there is only one bathroom for the two bedrooms to share. Also, we did not have internet access for the first day and a half because we were given the wrong Network and the wrong password. The TV was not getting a signal until somebody fixed it, but then even with the volume turned up to Max, it was barely Audible. Also the channel guide was all wrong. There were several things throughout the condo that were in need of repair. The king bed had King pillows with standard pillow cases so the pillow stuck out. The twin beds had full size fitted sheets which made them loose and rumpled up. Everything was just sort of substandard. I asked for a one-night comp, and I still have not heard back.</Text>< Pictures>

The Kyuka home in Sea Ranch was an absolute pleasure to stay in! The views are spectacular, and easily enjoyable with all of the large windows throughout the house.

The home is fully stocked with anything you could possible need. It was very clean, and comfortable. The open, and spacious living/ kitchen area are perfect for socializing with friends and family.

The memories we made as family in this home will be cherished forever. Thank you Grand Welcome ♥️<//text>

<Rating>3</Rating><Text>Our family has vacationed at this lovely lakefront home on two separate occasions. December 2017 and June 2019. Both times, the house was perfect for our large gathering of family members from near and far. I would give this gorgeous retreat 5 stars, but we had a couple of issues.

Smallest issue first...a window shade was missing in one of the upstairs bedrooms, allowing lights from the building next door to flood in at night, and providing a lack of privacy, of course. We hung a sheet over the window...functional, but not very attractive.

More upsetting issues...due to the fact that the house is not regularly inhabited, when the water pipes detect new activity, a blaring alarm goes off, with the warning:  leak. We were able to disarm the alarm, but then realized that the entire system had shut down...no water. The first emergency number listed...the one belonging to Grand Welcome...answered our first call around 10pm, and promised that a repair person would arrive shortly. After an hour or so of waiting, with no repair person in sight, I called the Grand Welcome emergency number again. After numerous attempts, I was finally able to connect to someone when I clicked on the support line not for Lake Tahoe, but for San Diego. With no help on the way, I luckily discovered that our neighbors were still awake. They were able to provide us with instructions for getting the water flowing again.

The next day, a clogged shower drain prevented us from using one of the upstairs showers. We did not have the tools needed to remove the screen. Again, the first emergency number listed, Grand Welcome, was called. After numerous calls, we finally connected with someone after clicking the line as a potential home owner wanting to list our property with Grand Welcome...quite a damn diss!

After the two emergency situations, we THEN noticed a second emergency number, a local number.

I suggest that a more perfect vacation could've been had if:  1.) The local emergency number was posted FIRST, and was prominently posted in the house for all to see, and 2.)  Should the "water leak" alarm blare with each new use of the pipes, a notice should also be prominently posted, with detailed instructions as to the steps involved in returning the system to full operating mode.

Due to these inconveniences, I've asked for slight refund of our rental fees. That is yet to be seen...will keep y'all posted!<//Text>< pics>

<Review>The place was super clean and in very good shape.  The unit is not new but they definitely keep it up.  The pool and jacuzzi were very close by.  One issue we had was there are no pool towels!  They were nice about late checkout.  We comfortably slept 4 adults and 6 kids.  The distance to the village gondola could not be beat!  Thanks for the great memories.  Heads up, the stairs in the unit are very tight spiral stairs, if you are very heavy or get dizzy this may not be the unit for you.  But my kids absolutely loved that!!!</Review>< Pics>

The view was beautiful.  However the cabin was filthy.  Counters, sink & flooring were dirty in kitchen.  Downstairs bedroom (double bed room) had dead bugs on the floor (clearly not vacuumed) & the attached bathroom desperately needs a deep cleaning (shower rusty from water but can come clean with Clorox spray with bleach).  Upstairs bathroom had a Bobby pin on the floor, hairs on the floor & in the shower.  Tub hadn’t been cleaned.<//Review>

< review>
We had a wonderful time at the cabin!  It had plenty of room for our large family gathering, and room to spread out for separate activities or quite time.  Grand kids loved the pool table and the legos and the bunk beds in the large upstairs room.  We were fortunate to have great weather during our stay, so we spent a lot of time at the dock and on the extensive sandy beach playing in the water.  We also enjoyed the patio and the fire pit for hot dogs and s'mores.  It is a very relaxing location, and tucked back in off a quiet street.  The house seemed well prepared when we arrived.  Just a couple of minor inconveniences; ran low on T-paper, and had no dish soap for cleaning up in the kitchen, so made a quick run to the store.  Overall a great experience!  Will likely book again.< /review>

The cabin we rented was beautiful and in a good location with privacy.  There were some serious concerns with the cleanliness of the cabin.  The first day we were there, we found a dead mouse in one of the closets and a box of exposed rat poison (poison pellets)in another closet.  The exposed pellets could have been a danger for children.  In the master bedroom we found mouse droppings in one of the closets.  It was apparent that the floors had not been cleaned.  There were some stains on the carpets, as well, that should have been cleaned.  We called customer service and received a visit from  local management staff who removed the dead mouse and the poison.  They also put batteries in the media room remote and got the video equipment working.  They also replaced a broken broom.

When I called the corporate customer service number, I was on hold for about 15 to 20 minutes.  When they answered they transferred me to a manager, she said she would contact the local manager.  I requested that they should discount the cost of the rental... reimburse part of the cost, for not having fully cleaned before we arrived and  for distress caused from discovering a dead rodent and poison in the house.  The manager at corporate that I talked with said she would call me back after she received the report from local staff.  I still haven't heard from her...not very good follow up...or customer service.

If it weren't for the problems mentioned, I would probably have rated it a 5. But because of these problems and lack of follow up I rate this a 1.  Hopefully someone will at least follow up with me.  Still waiting.....<//review>

The location was perfect and so was the lay out of the house.  I was a little hesitant because other reviews mentioned this and it turns out they were spot on.
As I told told the front desk girl when we returned the welcome package our only issue was the house was dirty. I made the mistake of looking under the bed to make sure none of our items were under there and I almost vomited.  All around the bed looked like it hadn’t been vacuumed in years; the shower curtains were covered in thick mold at the bottom; most of the dishes had to be run through the dishwasher again and in general the floors weren’t clean and the furniture was really old.
It’s a shame because location and lay out of the house is great but it needs a major cleaning and updating.<//Text>

<Text>The home was nice and clean inside, outside there was dog waste cigarettes and beer bottles. I emailed and called no one showed to clean it up. No soap in bathrooms and the company even delivered furniture during my stay without my approval. I had to stay at the home for over an hour while my family was at the beach.</Text>< response>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Text>The house in So Lake Tahoe was nice.  The views from the porches were beautiful.  Hiking trails close by and a short drive to the lake.  We did have some issues with the smaller  kitchen appliances, ie toaster, coffee maker not working.  The bear box where we were instructed to put in the trash would not open.  Had to call Grand Welcome for instructions on what to do with the trash before departing.  Grand Welcome was always helpful when we needed assistance.  Will use Grand Welcome again!</Text>< Name>

< review>
We were very disappointed in the property The Birdhouse, and wonder what the owners would think, if they walked in and had to stay for a week based on the amenities listed.

There is no dishwasher, as listed. This left us immediately washing dishes to use, because who knows how "clean" the previous renters were.

There is no DVD player (that we could find) for either TV, as listed.

There is no garden/backyard, as listed (on property management website).

There is no fireplace, as listed. This compounded with the fact that the heater in the living area is "inoperable" and the space heaters provided were not capable of heating a room in December made it miserable. (Have you gone in and tried to heat the place at 4:00 in the afternoon, in December?) The heater in the bedroom does warm up the room, but is too noisy to leave on when resting or sleeping (if you want to hear the ocean, which you can, even with closed doors). We left heaters on all night and still woke up to a cold house.

The linens provided are sorely lacking. The bathroom towels have stains on them, as do the thin sheets in the bedroom. The pillowcases were absolutely covered with pills, on both sides. No one wants to lay their head down on that.

We were immediately invaded by ants in the kitchen. We bought and brought groceries for our 6 night stay and couldn't even use the kitchen. The knives provided were left out on the kitchen counter, and had to be washed before use. Every time. The "kitchenette prepared with everything needed to prepare delicious meals" consists of one pot, and one pan, some salt and pepper, and opened soy sauce.

Besides these misrepresentations, it should be made clear that the parking area is VERY muddy (after rains), and you'll track mud everywhere. Including back into your car. Also, there are many more steps than the photos show. We were not prepared for that, as our luggage for a week's stay was heavy.

We spent 6 hours driving to what we thought was going to be a peaceful and lovely Christmas, only to be faced with a total and complete misrepresentation that forced us to drive 6 hours home the next day. These accommodations could be so lovely with a heating system that works (even one of those fake electric fireplaces), decent linens, a better stocked kitchen, and no ants. You'll need to correct your listing for fireplace, DVD, garden/backyard, and dishwasher so other renters know exactly what they're paying for.< /review>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>On the plus side, some of the problems reported by previous renters have been fixed.  The broken windows were repaired (although there were a few glass shards left behind), the carpet had probably been cleaned (though not spotless), screens had been replaced allowing the windows to be opened, and the master bathroom had been nicely remodeled.

However, the stairs off the upstairs master were still broken, with a railing that was about to fall off.  This is very dangerous, particularly given the best views are from that deck, and could lure people out into harms way. They may have added lamps to address the lighting issues, but there were no hall way lights on the downstairs or outside, making going out in the dark an iffy proposition.  The railing in the kitchen has gaps big enough that a toddler could get their head stuck or slip underneath the railing to fall down the stairs.  There were exposed electrical wires in the ceilings and no plate cover on the electrical plug in the stone sitting area near the fireplace.  The smoke detector was simply laying on a table (and didn't work). There didn't appear to be a way to open the garage door (and the company didn't respond to our texts asking about how to get the door to open). There was no working light in the garage.  There were several fairly attractive throw rugs, but unfortunately they kept bunching up and becoming tripping hazards.  Many of the windows were fogged between panes. The kitchen drawers hadn't been cleaned out of crumbs for who knows how long.  The kitchen drawers had no stops so they could come how and fall on the floor if unprepared. The doors to the bedrooms upstairs couldn't be closed because they caught on the carpet of throw rug.

The home in the photos looks really nice and pristine, but it is not representative of the condition of the property, which had quite a bit of water damage. Worst of all, we had contacted the management company once we read the previous reviews and had been assured the problems had all been fixed.  We cannot recommend this property, particularly if there are children.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

Kabella  is a wonderful home, very well located in The Sea Ranch with everything needed for a comfortable stay. If we had an issue, the management company quickly responded. The hummingbirds were amazing in the Mexican salvia blooming beside the deck. Can’t wait to return!</Review>

<review>Rental company was really easy to work with and sent lots of useful documentation via email prior to stay. Rented in Mammoth Lakes, CA where we just needed to stop by the office to pick up the keys and parking pass then drop the keys off afterwards. Didn't need to contact them for any issues during the stay but the front desk staff was very friendly.< /review>< gmapID>

We stayed at the Kona Bay View house. The place has a great view but the house itself has a few issues. It was advertised as having a hot tub, but it never gets hot. In trying to heat it up, we blew the main breaker twice. The electric service for this house is not enough and needs updated. We called for help the first time it blew because we could not get the breaker to flip back. This happened to be at night.  They sent the electric company out to help us. Also the cover on the main breaker was off, husband says this is dangerous. Never did figure out the hot tub, so gave up. The house itself is nice and had lots of room for our family, the pans in the kitchen are worn out, especially the fry pans, we like to cook so this was an issue for us. We were disappointed about the hot tub.<//text>

House was nice and in a great location for South Lake - close to beaches and down, and some good stuff within a mile walking distance. Quiet neighbors and enough privacy.

However, was disappointed to see the lack of some basic essentials you would normally expect to see in a rental property like this. No cleaning supplies for the kitchen, limited garbage bags, no beach towels / chairs, limited silverwear. We had to purchase all of this stuff and was a bit annoying.

Also no central air conditioning was a bit of surprise when we arrived. It was not that big of a deal at night though when the temp drops.<//Text>

< Review>
House was nice and in a great location for South Lake - close to beaches and down, and some good stuff within a mile walking distance. Quiet neighbors and enough privacy.

However, was disappointed to see the lack of some basic essentials you would normally expect to see in a rental property like this. No cleaning supplies for the kitchen, limited garbage bags, no beach towels / chairs, limited silverwear. We had to purchase all of this stuff and was a bit annoying.

Also no central air conditioning was a bit of surprise when we arrived. It was not that big of a deal at night though when the temp drops.<//Review>

Loved the condo. There was plenty of room to spread out. Had to keep the heater on 66 for sleeping so the folks in the loft didn't roast. Plenty of blankets helped downstairs. Space heaters or electric blankets would help those sleeping downstairs. The middle bedroom mattress topper is quite firm. Fully equiped kitchen made cooking and meals easy to manage. Easy walk to the spa and the bus.< /text>

Grand Welcome
We arrived after 10pm to a townhouse (802) lacking even minimal amenities. Having a digital door key is a great idea, no chance of loosing keys. A garage door opener would also be a good idea, it could be secured the same way as the Beach Club pass with a $250.00 replacement fee if lost. The condo itself was nice but dated. Carpets needed a cleaning, as did the throw rugs in the bathrooms which were filthy. We would have thrown those in the washing machine if there was washer soap available, instead just used towels.
The welcome booklet was comprised of all the rules and regulations, but no map of the Fairways complex. Instructions were to register our vehicle with complex manager, but no directions as to where he could be found, or the pool. WiFi was erratic and appeared to have not been paid.
We have rented condos in the past and generally basics, dish and laundry soap, toilet paper, paper towels, coffee, etc, are provided. We would have just accepted that the owner/rental agent was just trying to recoup strata fees and make the best of a bad investment except for the fact that our son and his family were renting the unit next door where all those amenities were provided and more. Including general cooking supplies and condiments, (our salt shaker was empty). It was also obvious because of their attitude towards the renters that renters had in turn left condiments and amenities they had left over at the end of their stay; the place was literally over stocked, even suntan lotion. A map of the complex, location of pool and manager’s office were included in their welcome book as well as vehicle mirror identification hangers.
At the end of our stay we left all leftover amenities and condiments we had purchased in my son’s unit.< /text>

Great location and wonderful view.  Would definitely stay here again and use Grand Welcome.   We had a problem come up after booking and Grand Welcome and the owner worked to allow us to change our reservation.   Great customer service</review>

<username>Kevin Clements<//username><text>We really enjoyed our stay at the Forest Haven location in South Lake Tahoe. The home was clean, had all of the supplies you could need to cook while on vacation. The home had a Wii with lots of games, both TVs had Netflix, and lots of games for the kids to play. We especially loved the pool table up in the loft!
The staff we encountered went above and beyond.
Great place to rent from!< /text><Time>1564960742790<//Time><GmapID>0x80dd4bb3f478b09d:0xcdcc24e0f6697ca9<//GmapID>< resp>

<Review>The check in staff was incompetent. We drove in at 4 and wouldn't let us in early. We had to wait till 5.  she promised to call when the unit was ready and didn't. No one answered the phone when we called, so we drove back, only to find out they were closing for the night. Had we missed the closing, 1/2 hour after our earliest check in, we would have had to sleep in the car.

The unit was advertised as 3 bathrooms but it had 2 bathrooms and a sink in one of the bedrooms. The confirmation letter from the manager stated 3 bathrooms. I asked for an adjustment but they never gave one to me. They acted like it was my fault.

The room heater made so much noise that you had to be cold if you wanted to sleep.

The place needed repairs and cleaning.<//Review>< pics>

This was our second stay; we felt like we were coming home.  The condo is very well equipped---and the location can't be beat.  There is more street noise than we remembered, but with the A/C on at night we slept well.  To get within walking distance to Kailua Town, you will have to put up with traffic, and with traffic comes noise.  We love being able to walk to town and not worry about parking, so we are willing to put up with some noise.
Comfy king-size bed, great shower, washer/dryer---all the comforts of home.</Review>

The cabin itself is cute - a little on the dark side in the interior downstairs, but cabin'y cute with all the wood.  And the kitchen was adequately supplied - except maybe for some serving spoons?  The view from the back deck is lovely - lots of space around the exterior of the cabin with all kinds of trees and no neighbors right close.  I did wish, however, there had been a full-size table on the deck rather than a low 'coffee' table.  The furnishings were comfortable except for the main level bedroom bed which had an awfully soft mattress, and I wish the beds had been supplied with summer blankets.  The heavy winter quilts were too much for the summer weather.
A MAJOR COMPLAINT:  There was no 'welcome' portfolio explaining how to run the TV, or letting renters know when garbage pickup day was, and etc.  This was the first cabin we've rented over the years that did not have such a thing.  I was surprised!  And disappointed as we had trouble trying to run the TV without any instructions.  Other than that  :)  we did enjoy our stay in "Cozy Tahoma Cabin".<//Text>

<review>I am so disappointed with the poor customer service exhibited by Grand Welcome during a recent stay in one of the properties they manage on Airbnb. A group of friends and I rented a property in Breckenridge, CO for a weekend recently and it was a total disaster. We arrived to find that the incorrect keys were in the lock box so we were unable to enter the property. The rep from Grand Welcome eventually sent out a lock smith who we had to deal with to rekey the cabin (this should not have been our responsobility). Finally we got in and found that the place had not been cleaned from the previous occupants. Clearly the cleaning crew could not enter the property without the correct keys. After numerous phone calls and texts to Grand Welcome, they finally responded and told us that they would put us in a hotel for the evening since it was too late to get a cleaning crew out to the property. At this point we had already lost out on hours dealing with all this, but we were told over the phone that we would get a refund for the first night. This seemed fair considering we did not even get to stay on the property that night. We figured it was behind us and were even applauding Grand Welcome for their good customer service. However, once we left the property we found that the rep from Grand Vacations completely stopped responding to our attempts to get into contact with them regarding our refund for the first night. This was absolutely ridiculous and so unprofessional. We requested the refund through Airbnb which they promptly denied. We also still had to pay a ridiculous $300 cleaning fee for a house that was not clean on our arrival. Airbnb finally stepped in and refunded us only partially for that first night, no thanks to Grand Welcome who completely ignored our very reasonable requests to be compensated for this terrible experience.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>
{'time': 1580135897200, 'text': "Hi Kristen,\nWe sincerely apologize for the issues during the beginning of your stay. I do see that our time has paid $407 for 1 night in a hotel room due to the oversight from our cleaning crew. This was a huge oversight from our team and we have brought this up to our local manager and the operations manager to make sure this does not happen again. Unfortunately, your refund request for 1 night was denied because of the $407 nightly rate from the hotel. If we were to refund you for the night not spent, we would have had to charge you for the hotel that you've stayed at instead. Therefore, your refund request was denied.\nPlease feel free to contact us at (888)780-4809 or email us at CustomerCare@GrandWelcome.com if you have any questions or concerns. Thank you."}<//Response>

Grand Welcome's modern, spacious and well appointed (there were so many towels, pillows, linens were available!) Mauna Lani Golf Villas Unit Q-22 perfectly accommodated our family's weekend getaway. The children adored the pool (it's not too cold, not too deep and expansive enough to not be crowded), the adults enjoyed the quiet serenity of the complex (quite unlike the sprawling, crowded nearby resorts which cost much more), and the fully equipped kitchen allowed us to self cater most of our meals comfortably and easily without needing to add things (like we often do).

Grand Welcome also provided a personal phone call from an on-island agent once the booking was made, and then followed up with a second arrival call to make sure everything was all right with the self check in process. I have used a dozen other booking agencies/platforms over the last decade, and this is the only company that reached out in this way...and twice. Very impressed, and highly recommend both this company, and this unit. A large family would find the loft particularly private, roomy and an ideal third bedroom! You won't regret booking this accommodation in such a gorgeous setting with so much to do (the private beach club is something you won't find anywhere else on island).</Review>

Our recent stay at our rental was disappointing.  The weekly rate for the home was right at $4000, yet almost every single day we did not have hot water.
The majority of the time that we would realize we didn’t have hot water would be after 5 o’clock when we would return from an outing. Each time we would call to notify someone that we did not have hot water, we were told that unfortunately there was no one available to come fix it and there would be someone out the next day. We would only have hot water if the little gray box was switched on to electric but we were told that it had to be ran through the solar power system. Inevitably we would have to turn on the little gray box to electric to get hot water. By the end of our stay, we just got tired of having to call someone so we just turned it on to get hot water.
The home we stayed in the week prior was a much older home, with a total of 16 people and we never once went without hot water.
As a form of compensation/insult, someone from the management company came to the home, walked in without knocking because she didn’t think anyone was home, and gave us a $100 gift card from target.
I would not recommend renting this home due to the fact, it is very expensive and you have to take cold showers.</text>

Dolphins would swim by or stop and play out the front. Sunsets were spectacular even seeing a night or two with the “green flash”. Everything you need is there for an enjoyable, relaxing stay. 5 minute walk to Magic Sand Beach. Close drive to the park for snorkling. Our only complaint if you want to call it that, is if you are a light sleeper and have the back bedroom the road traffic is loud. For the master ocean he sound of the waves do lull you to sleep. The third room is. Fold out futon and great for small kids. The couches in the front room are comfortable. Previous guests had left some basics like salt, pepper, some spices, oils, soya, etc. To use. Would stay again for sure loved that old vibe of the home.< /Review><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80dd4bb3f478b09d:0xcdcc24e0f6697ca9<//gmap_id><pictures>None</pictures>< name>

Sunshine Village #142 in Mammoth, CA was perfect for our group.  It was the perfect size and comfortable!  Having a kitchen while on vacation is perfect for our family.  Thank you Grand Welcome!</Review>

<Review>The sea view that greeted you from the sitting room, waves crashing with no obstruction, was unique, actually fabulous. But from there everything went down: no wifi, a large TV screen but grainy to no reception, the furniture date from the 1970's with missing handles, kitchen ware sparse and awful, did they have in the 1970's nonstick pans? Noisy wall heating but no way to get fresh air unless opening the front door. We stayed three nights, two too many!< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>The house was overall okay. A bit dated in decor and the towels were sparse and threadbare. The beds were comfortable and the Wi-Fi/ technology were great. The kitchen was well stocked but the bathrooms had only 1 roll of toilet paper and master had no soap. We did use the grill but didn’t heat up very well so used the oven instead. The fake flowers on the walkway  were also a downer. Maybe this house is better during the ski season<//Text>< GmapID>

<Rating>3</Rating><review>Great Location! Great Cabin!....COULDN'T GET IN THE CABIN! We sat in our vehicles for 3 hours trying to figure out how to get in. McKayla, the after hours contact did her best to figure out solutions to get us in which I can only imagine how frustrated she was trying to locate someone who had some answers. She was very professional and did a great job keeping us informed on the steps being taken.

However, we had to continue to drive from the cabin to a location that we could access cell service to try the suggestions being made of how to get in. It was a frustrating, wasted night for our group and were sad to not have had the amount of time we should have had in the cabin.

We LOVED the cabin! We LOVED the location! It was clean and ready for us once we were able to get in.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80dd4bb3f478b09d:0xcdcc24e0f6697ca9< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Well, it turns out that I should have read the reviews about the condo i stayed in. I didn't, and resented it.
The pictures show a rather nice place, but they proved slightly misleading. Upon checking in in early August, the inside temperature was 83 degrees, and when we called we were told that the condo doesn't have air conditioning (so they brought 3 fans over the next day). We also told them about a ceiling light fixture that came off its mount in the middle of the first night (it snagged on the ceiling fan chain, or it would have fallen right in the middle of a bed someone was sleeping in). We also reported a broken TV in the master bedroom, and the blinds in the master bedroom were also broken - neither were addressed by the property management during our 5 day stay.
The carpeting doesn't look like its been shampooed in recent history. The screen door on the side of the condo fell off its track, so we put it back together ourselves rather than waiting for the property managers. The redwood decking material outside has worn over the years, and now most of the deck screws are above flush and could cause injuries to someone barefoot. My wife found a bit of mildew in the master shower the first day and had to clean it up.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80dd4bb3f478b09d:0xcdcc24e0f6697ca9< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

If you are looking for an upscale place maybe this isn't for you, if you are looking for a comfortable unit with space enough for your family with a private hot tub and quick access to town and stores check this unit out  We rented Forest creek unit 11. I would rent this again for our next visit< /review>

Grand Welcome was fine and sent someone over right away to fix a TV that was not getting cable when I arrived.  The unit, however, was lacking in that only the shower had been renovated and the rest of the unit was from the 70's.  It did have nice enough furniture and TV's but the old wall heaters suck and the mattress was terrible with springs digging into my sides.< /Text>

Place was well stocked/equipped on most fronts.  Empty BBQ propane tank was left by front door, patios looked like hadn't been cleaned in awhile, with beer caps, bottles, and cigarette butts mixed in with tons of pine needles.  Inside bowls had ring stains and rugs hadn't been beaten/cleaned.  Place served well as a last minute option, nice space, downside, price was exorbitant with the fees, cleanliness, was away from action, no hot tub, and wouldn't take dogs after emailing they would.  Getaway Café restaurant nearby was great for breakfast.  Wish our stay could have earned 5 stars.  Grand Welcome seems a scam, and this not your ordinary AirBnb</Review>

The home we rented for the month was terrific, as nice as the pictures suggested it would be.  We rate the home with five stars.  The service from Grand Welcome, however, did not meet our needs or expectations.  Due to a snow storm, our travel plans changed abruptly.   We attempted to contact Grand Welcome multiple times via email and  phone calls to discuss, but never heard from them.  Quite disappointing.  We would rent the home again, but not sure we would use GW.<//Review>

Not good. Dead mouse in trap in dining room,  chair exploded while my friend was sitting... it had been re glued .....2 car garage was actually 1 car due to the fact that 1 side was full of the owners stuff.  Carpets are filthy,  advertised as up to 8 guests but only enough towels for 6.  Other then that it was not good.  By the way if you need something from the phone number listed...we’ll still waiting 2 days later or email.</Text>

Don´t understand the partially worse reviews... We stood at Kona Isle, HI in condo C38 in dec 2018. The condo was absolutely clean, well and comfy furbished with fully equipped kitchen and nice ocean views. The beach chairs were quite new, there was really nothing to complain about. I really recommend a stay at this unit.<//review>

The house did NOT have a working hottub. There was trash left from previous renters. The dishwasher was left full and contained broken glass. The upstairs balcony railing is dangerous. The downstairs bath/shower is out of order and unusable. The front door keypad stopped working and although it was fixed for our last day, we were not informed that someone would be accessing the house during our stay.

Grand Welcome, the property managers, did not attempt to call, text or email me at all to address these issues, but were very apologetic when I called them. They offered a refund for the hottub but have since gone quiet.

The house deserves better management, it is well appointed, with modern furnishings and the beds are comfortable.

Please STOP falsely advertising that is has a hottub when it doesn't and hasn't for a long time.< /text>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>UPDATED:  ATTENTION TO UPPER MANAGEMENT TEAM:  A high growth company can't have customer sales and care agent to continue providing false information!!!!!!!  PLEASE READ BELOW

I booked a vacation rental home in Oct. 2019 at Sea Ranch California, for Jan. 2020 stay, it was booked via Vrbo, the property was billed and managed by Grand Welcome.

1. The 2nd installment was charge by Grand Welcome 45 days prior to due date of Nov. 24 and without notification, I found out through credit card statement.

2. Upon receiving the actual address, I accidentally found out that the rental home has no 'HEAT' system!
With confirmation with Grand Welcome, I stressed that it is a necessity to have heating system when stay in California coastline during wintertime when average temperature is around 40F in evening!
By that reason, I would need to cancel the reservation and book somewhere else.

3. The Grand Welcome customer care staff sent me to vrbo, only to find out  that I was miss led by the staff, the actual cancelation should be with Grand Welcome.  I got ping-ponged!

4. After back and forth talking to two Grand Welcome customer representatives, I was told that I had to pay for the $75 cancellation fee, ( my fault not knowing there is no heat sign on the website),  however, a manager would call me by end of the day to talk about the cancelation waiver.
No one called me back; except, I had to call again to request confirmation email for the cancelation!

5. I talked to most of my friends, no one believes the situation is fair and my terrible 1st experience by dealing vacation rental!.

CONT. ON 11/13/19:  as of today, after the cancelation had been made for over one week, I was told by the agent that the refund process was made on 11/9.  Only to find out on 11/13, this cancelation needs to get accounting approval, there is no timeframe for refund process.

This company's customer sales/customer care agent is absolutely not reliable when providing information to customers.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

A review from Abigail, 10.

I like that it had three beds and that no matter what everyone has a balcony. I also found that the pool was fogging up and it did bug me as my goggles didn't work as well, but by the last day it cleared up.

I like that it supplies you with stuff to do, like the pool noodle, the body board, and the snorkle set.

I liked that I was able to bodyboard at the beach last year and I like that this year some days the waves were calmer so I was able to go body-surfing. I also like when the waves hit against the first surf wall and I could hear it when I went to sleep as it really calmed down my brain.< /Text>

I don't know where to begin. The unit  was ill equipped for renters. We have rented 25 places in Vail over the past 35 years and this unit was by far one of the least likely places to have someone want to rent again.  The kitchen does not have enough cooking equipment such as pots and pans (one of each), no dishwasher soap and even after we bought some the soap residue stays on dishes and silverware.  Had to purchase laundry soap, the heat at night in lower bedrooms was  unbearable with the window in one bdrm  having a broken mechanism so you can't even open the window to cool the  bdrm, we had very little sleep the whole week we were there because of the heat. I called the mgmt. company about the lack of needed items and they sent over a bag of travel size bottles of dish soap both hand and washer type, and laundry soap. Thank goodness we brought our own Firestick without it  there would never have been any TV, there is only one small flat screen in the living room with no cable.  The best thing I can say about this unit was that the location was very good with a bus stop across the street.<//review>

We stayed at house in Sea Ranch managed by Grand Welcome.  The service was terrible.  We could never get anyone by phone when we had problems.  We left many messages and never got a call back.  Sewage backed up into our tub and after a few calls, they finally got a plumber out, but never called us to let us know what was happening. They also rarely even answered emails.  It was very complicated making the reservation and our stay was full of troubles.  Strong milden smell in the house.  Greasy head marks on the best view windows.  Dirty dishes in the dish washer.  Water level very low in the hot tub so we had to add a lot of cold water and wait.  No instructions on how to work the TV so we almost missed the Academy Awards.  On and on. Really terrible service.  We have been going to this same house for 25 years and always had good service until this company took over.<//Text>

< Review>
We stayed at Bearadise in Lake Tahoe. The inside of the home was okay, but the back deck was filthy and in disarray. It was advertised as a place to gather and grill; however we could hardly walk out the back door and it was full of leftover, unsightly stuff. The grill was very dirty, one of the adirondack chairs was broken and there was trash in the yard. As for the kitchen, the pots and pans were caked with food, freezer was not defrosting and puddling on the floor. The counter stools were bar height instead of counter height. The master bathroom tub didn't drain. There wasn't any shampoo/bath soap etc. Generally speaking, it appears the owner hasn't visited in awhile.  The place need some TLC. I reached out to Grand Welcome with my concerns and did not receive a reply .< /Review>

<Text>This company has absolutely incompetent and terrible management. They had multiple bad reviews. I forgot something quite expensive in one of their accommodation and immediately that day, asked them if they would be so nice and send it to me. Even I sent them the exact location with a photo. They weren't trying to solve the problem so I called them and they hang up on me (not put on hold, but regularly hang up!). After one week they said that the thing is not there anymore.  Unprofessional attitude, don't care about customers. Based on voices on the phone, it looked that the company is run by a bunch of teenagers.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<text>The unit was in poor condition for the cost, for example the bathroom faucet is broken and the handles need to be spun just right to ensure the water is stopped and the bed was beyond firm.  We also received two sets of keys in the lock box, and although we should have double checked they both actually worked, I know what they say about assumptions, they did both have the condo location on the identical key chains, we were locked out of the until when we grabbed the wrong set of keys on our way out.  The team was very nice and the maintenance guy did get to us quickly.  The location was great but we could have used better directions to the underground parking because arriving at night the signs are not clearly lit.< /text>< rating>

UPDATE MARCH 2019:

The owner of Grand Welcome contacted us and offered to give us a refund / future credit for our experiences.   They admitted they were having some issues in Idaho and were working on it.  8 months later we stayed at one of the properties they managed in Tamarack, ID.  They have a new onsite manager.  There was a HUGE difference in their customer service and cleanliness.   You can tell the new manager really cares about doing a good job.  We are so glad they have fixed the issues they were having and hope to see it continue!  I have changed my review score to 5 stars.

Will not stay at any of the homes managed by the company.  We tried 3 different homes and they were all disgusting.  Floors were black, bathrooms had pink slime and mold, one stay one of the beds had been peed on and just made up wet.  Had to remove the bed to the garage because of the smell. Not sure why any owner would trust this company with their rental.  We emailed them during our stay and never received a response.  Called them after two of our stays (we love traveling where they have 90% of the inventory of homes) trying to let them know of our concerns so they could fix it.  They clearly do not care.  Have talked to others that have used this company and they had the same experience.

UPDATE:  Their response to my review asks that I contact them about our stay.  I contacted them after 2 of the 3 stays.  Was told "sorry" and that
someone in management would call me back, which never happened.    To the person that responded to my review:  you have my information and if you wanted to contact me, you could.  I am confident you are just trying to make yourself look better by posting the response you did.  Contact me if you really want to "make it right".</Text>

<Review>We stayed at the Banyon Tree condo #305 for 2 weeks.   The view was amazing, the condo not so much!   The condo needs some repairs.  First off, the sliding glass door would not open, the front door handle would fall off in your hand, the towels smelled like mold, the beds were horrible. The springs we're poking up on the bed!  The dryer vent was not hooked up correctly and it took HOURS to dry a small load of clothes and there were little repairs that need done.   When you pay that much money for a condo I expect better!     When I called the number and advised of the sliding door and the font door handle, on three different occasions no one came out to fix anything. VERY DISAPPOINTING!  We will stay at the Banyon Tree again, but NOT in that unit!!!!!   I am only giving it two stars for the view!<//Review>< pics>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>The house was amazing, however the service really leaves something to be desired. When we got to our place we could not get in. We called, emailed, texted, but didn't get through. Even the emergency line just went to voicemail. It turned out we we were not given the front door code in our welcome packet, which we need to get into the front door. What is more surprising is no one got back with us until the following day. I have since tried to follow up with this experience, but it very difficult to get , and ahold of management. In the end you don't feel like they care.< /review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

<text>After staying at 35587 Timber Ridge Road, Sea Ranch, CA in an AirBnB, it is interesting that the management company sends me requests for reviews, but when I try to leave comments, the home disappears from their listings.  This home was ABSOLUTELY FILTHY!  Do not be fooled by the "Dramatic home" description written by their marketing company.  Grand Welcome management company does not allow you to check in until 4 pm.  By the time you arrive at your rental, the office is closed, so you can't get any assistance.  We stayed up until 2 am washing ALL the bedding in the house after finding blood on pillowcases, yellow stains on bedspreads, someone else's socks inside the bed and evidence of bedbug stains on the mattress protectors.  Cobwebs were EVERYWHERE!  There was actual green mold under the dining room table glass.  The "master bath" was a toilet facing the washing machine on a filthy concrete floor similar to a garage bathroom -   Unusable during the day, because everyone in the living area could see in to the master bath through filthy muslin curtains.  The beds are all 3" foam pads and the bed pillows are at least 20 years old.  I phoned the rental management company first thing the morning after checking in.  They offered me a late check out for our troubles.  How generous!  THREE DAYS LATER - the night before we checked out, they called to say they would be delivering clean sheets to us.  SERIOUSLY???  Never mind - we already washed everything using our own detergent, Lysol and Clorox wipes.  I have yet to hear back from them and it's been a week.  $445 for cleaning fee and service fee for 4 nights.  $2,000 for rent.  What a scam.  RENTERS BEWARE!  This home is despicable and so is the AirBnB management company, "Grand Welcome".< /text>< Pics>

We got to Mammoth Snowcreek #566 and the door code given to me did not work (Strike 1).

Had to reach out to the office to get the correct code. Now, 2 TVs don't work (Strike 2). Was told that they may be fixed before our stay is over.

Hope it gets better. But there are 2 strikes within the first 10 minutes of arrival.

If somehow my 4 night stay becomes better than it started, I will change my rating.

***Update***

There was a strike 3.

We were told before booking Snowcreek #566 by Grand Welcome via email and their amenities listing that there was a pool onsite. Guess what, there is not a pool here.
BUT there is one next door at the Snowcreek Athletic Club that charges $25 a day per person to use.< /Text>< Pics>

<review>Kona Makai #6302 is a great condo with ocean view and spacious lanai to enjoy the sunrise and sunset. Accommodations are wonderful. They have everything you will need for a wonderful stay. This is our second year at kona makai and we will continue to stay here. Complex is very well maintained and very quite. The condo itself is very spacious and has items for a day at the beach and everything you need in the kitchen including a washer and dryer. This is a great place and condo.

<rating>1< /rating><text>Worst stay of our lives ever since they changed ownership of the rental company.  We were suppose to be there for 10 days.  Our rental reeked of urine the moment we walked in and they never sent anyone out until we finally decided to leave one day early to stay at the Fairmont. There was also ant traps in the kitchen, roaches and mold.  The air filter was black and looked like it had not been changed in years.  We would have left after day 5 but they would not refund us any money.  The customer service team was awful and located in Los Angeles.  They finally sent their maid out on day 9.  She was no help either. She works for them and did not care. Our family had been staying in these units for 8 years and we will no longer be staying there. I wrote their management team numerous times and no one ever called or emailed me back.  This is the first time I have ever wrote a complaint as my family vacations 5 times a year and I travel weekly for work.  A vacation is suppose to be relaxing, enjoyable and stress free. This trip was none of the above until we checked into the Fairmont, which is beyond 5 stars.< /text>< Pictures>

<text>The Kaye house was very clean, warm and cozy. Huge picture window overlooked the ocean. Spacious living room to sit and relax. The beds were comfortable, especially the king master that led out to the private hot tub. Although the amenities said 'TV', it is only for DVD.  I recommend bringing your Roku and using your 'hotspot' if you want to stream live or as I did, watch the academy awards. Otherwise, no internet. I would definitely stay again. The price is good, but the cleaning fee a little steep.<//text>< time>

Lack of air conditioning and the written noise complaint i received for playing the tv too loud after 9 pm made the overall experience 2 stars.  It's difficult to close your windows to prevent noise from leaving the unit when it is already very hot with them open. It's also difficult to hear your tv when you have three fans running full speed next to the open windows and slider while sitting in shorts and no shirt on the couch, and still feeling hot.  Personally i didn't  think the tv was that loud but apparently the neighbors did.  I used closed captioning after that because the fans were staying on! Maybe others can deal with this but I won't be going there again.<//review>< rate>

<review>We rented a condo in Kona Hawaii.  The location of the condo was great.  The condo needed help.  The carpet was filthy and we were afraid to walk on it barefoot.  The cabinets in the kitchen were greasy to the touch.  The beds were clean and comfortable and the kitchen was stocked OK.

<review>We rented a condo in Kihei (Maui, Hawaii) through Grand Welcome and I am so glad we did. Not only did we get a better deal than going through VRBO or AirBNB but they offered a military discount too. The condo was well kept, clean, stocked with all the essentials while offering a beautiful view. I will continue using GW from now on. The customer service is great as well! I think Amy is the name of the nice lady who took care of our needs. I look forward to future vacations stays, as long as it's through GW... I know it will be awesome.

We rented a two bedroom condo for two weeks, which was within walking distance to the Shops at Wailea and, another plus, the condo had a view to the ocean. We were excited to see plenty of beach chairs and an ice chest available for our use and the size of our condo was perfect for our family of 4.

However, within the first 10 minutes of arriving we were quickly disappointed. First, we opened up the wooden curtains in the living room to see the ocean and several pieces of each curtain came off (this was report to Grand Welcome and they offered to address it). Second, the listing stated the unit had air conditioning (it did but only in the bedrooms); therefore, we hardly felt comfortable cooking, eating or sitting in the living room, even with multiple fans circulating the hot air (the weather during our stay was 88-90 degrees consistently). There were also metal shutters throughout the unit. It was hard to open and close a few of them - the turning mechanisms could probably use some WD-40 or require strong wrists/muscles to open).

Third, the kitchen was not as adequately equipped (I wish there were more pots; baking sheets and cupcake pans; a rice cooker; wooden cooking utensils - the plastic ones bent while stirring; and BBQ utensils) than other condos we had rented and several of the baking pans were rusted. Additionally, there was a foul odor coming from the sink and we used the disposal to try to get rid of the smell, but it seemed to make it worse.

Fourth, we found that not all the outlets in the unit worked and it was hard to fall asleep at night due to the AC window units blaring in our ears. Additionally, the bed frame on one of the beds stuck out so much that my husband and I constantly hit our shins on it throughout our stay.

Fifth, we had vacationers above us during our whole stay who woke up at 5:30 am every morning (no fault of Grand Welcome and/or owner - but renter beware), which meant we would then be up due to the heavy walking (or stomping, jumping and running) happening above us.

And lastly, the unit came with two umbrellas for the beach. They came in handy, but one of them was broken and because of that, it made it hard to get into the sand. We didn’t use the bodyboard as it looked like it was falling apart. There weren’t any sand toys (not a big deal for anyone not traveling with kids), but it would’ve been nice not to have needed to buy some.

I honestly wished we had had a more pleasant and more comfortable stay, especially since we were there for so long. Unfortunately, I don’t think we will be returning to this unit and would not recommend it to anyone traveling during summer time due to how hot the unit was in the common areas.< /review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

<text>Overall our stay in Tahoe was great! The positive to the house was location. It was just a few minutes from the main part of south lake tahoe. Neighbrhood was quiet, very relaxing. We enjoyed sitting on the back porch and having cocktails. One evening a bear strolled by! We also used the hot tub and walked to the pool which is only a few minutes away.  We also really enjoyed the games the house has. Most of the things you need to cook are there, BBQ already had propane, but no keurig, luckily I brought our own. There were a few negatives that could easily be improved. The kitchen and bathrooms are dated but that was fine, however some of the kitchen cabinets are really worn, one drawer wouldn't even open. We had only 2 rolls of TP downstairs and 2 upstairs for 4 adults and 3 kids, not enough for 5 days. Also the 1 partially used roll of papertowels wasn't enough either. And we would have liked a hand towel in each bathroom, there were none to dry our hands. We brought most of our food and didn't plan to go to the store to get TP, paper towels, etc. The upstairs could use bigger fans since it gets hot up there and the downstairs mattress was terrible. Very squeaky,  not comfortable, sagged in the middle. I ended up sleeping on the sofa and my husband had to go upstairs to a twin bed, that was a huge negative for us. And check out is a little earyl at 10am, we barely could eat, pack up, tidy up and get out on time. Bummer to be so rushed the last morning in tahoe.  If the owners could improve the issues, we would definitely be back. The negatives did not ruin our stay, we had a great family vacation.</text>< pics>

We stayed at a property in Sea Ranch, CA. The property was great, but we couldn't get in until well after the listed check-in time (frustrating), then there was no WiFi password anywhere (annoying), and when we tried to call them they said "we'll look into it and call you back" but they never did (terrible).

Then we found out the hot tub was not working. Several attempted contacts later, we had to go KNOCK ON THE DOOR while the local office pretended nobody was there, and she called the repair guy and got everything resolved in minutes. Why it took us almost a full day to get issues resolved when they were so simple I have no idea, all I know is that the 24 hour support line that Grand Welcome touted to us was completely worthless, and if you have any issues with a place they operate, you're out in the cold.< /Review>

Property was poorly managed. Sleeper count was misadvertised. Two of the bathroom doors do not lock. There were staples protruding out of the carpet. $60 fee to check-in earlier than 5pm. Sad!< /Review>

This house was terrible. It was filthy dirty and many items in the house were broken. The most disconcerting item was the lock on the sliding door on the second floor did not lock at all. I was concerned that my toddler might get injured and or someone could easily break in while we slept. I contacted Grand Welcome about the broken lock on the sliding door several times and they did nothing. The beds and linens were old, pilled and beds were lumpy and caved in. Impossible to sleep, my husband ended up sleeping on the sofa which he said was uncomfortable but better than the "master bed". The decks are not furnished and covered in dirt so you can't enjoy the outdoor spaces. Glass in the driveway, hair on the towels, pee stains on the carpet, I could go on.< /Text>

The Kaye house was very clean, warm and cozy. Huge picture window overlooked the ocean. Spacious living room to sit and relax. The beds were comfortable, especially the king master that led out to the private hot tub. Although the amenities said 'TV', it is only for DVD.  I recommend bringing your Roku and using your 'hotspot' if you want to stream live or as I did, watch the academy awards. Otherwise, no internet. I would definitely stay again. The price is good, but the cleaning fee a little steep.< /Review>

I would highly recommend not using this company in the South Lake Tahoe area to manage your property. My husband and I had a contract signed with Paramount before they sold to Grand Welcome and our contract, house key and contact information were never transferred to the new company. We lost out on our Vacation Rental Permit spot because of this, ultimately losing us thousands per month. This company has a major disconnect and no flow. They are not working together and either have to much on their plate or they just do not care. Me and my husband were completely screwed by them, if I were you I would take your business somewhere else!!

This company removed their reviews section on their Facebook page because they had such bad reviews from people.< /text>

Worst vacation experience of my life.  Customer service was atrocious.  I have never written a vacation review in the past,  but I feel obligated to let anyone thinking of staying with Grand Welcome/Stay Lavish to stay away.
I stayed at the Wave House in Corona Del Mar.  The property was unkept, the flowers were dead, the house was dirty the propane in the barbecue was empty and customers service was next to non-existent.<//Review>

<Rate>2< /Rate><Review>My wife and I recently stayed at Casa Del Mar in The Sea Ranch.  The view was nice but far from the bluff.  The internet didn’t work at all which I was told was a provider outage.  The spa was toxically shocked and unusable which was a real disappointment.  Overall the house and outdoor furniture were dirty.  Cobwebs,  dead insects and just in need of a thorough deep cleaning.  The water pressure was terrible as well.  The grill was good and they had a spare tank in case we ran out which I asked for ahead as this has been an issue with other rentals.  We made the best of it and won’t be back.  I brought these issues to the management of Grand Welcome and asked for compensation and after the fact they offered me an early check in or late checkout on a future stay which is lame because I wouldn’t go through Grand Welcome again. On a previous stay they told me not to go thru VRBO that it would be less thru their site.  In reality the unit listed for the same price and fees on there and it would only save them money if I booked direct as they wouldn’t have to give a cut to VRBO.< /Review>< Pics>

My stay 4-night stay at 3151 Diamond Head Road was unsatisfactory and I am requesting a 50% refund of the rental fee for the following reasons:

Studio:

1) One of the guests stepped on a piece of glass in the shower stall and cut her foot.
2) The bedroom and bathroom were dark because light bulbs were.
3) The shower was either cold of tepid.
4) The bathroom sink stopper got stuck in the closed position so we had to remove the stopper to prevent the sink from overflowing.
5) TV did not work.

Master bedroom:
1) Bedroom smelled like mildew.
2) Bathroom tiles had mold.
3) Missing a bathmat in the tub, and one guest almost slipped and fell. We had to use a towel in the tub for a bathmat.
4)  Only bathroom with hot water for showers, so all of the guests had use in the master bath if they wanted a hot shower.

2nd bedroom:
1) A noise sporadically emanated from the hall toilet, disturbing the sleep of guests in the 2nd bedroom.  (We have a recording of the noise).
2) The shower was either cold of tepid.
3) TV did not work, could not get reception.

Hall Bathroom:
Two guests got locked in the bathroom.  The guests simply closed the door and found it locked when they attempted to exit. The door could not be unlocked from the inside. They had to exit to the outside to get out of the bathroom.

Living Room:
The house was advertised with AC, so it was very disappointing to find that it did not extend to the living room. The living area was hot and stuffy unless the sliding doors were open, which allowed insects to fly in. The fan did not sufficiently keep the room cool.  The living room screens were not useful because they did not pull out easily and did not extend far enough to cover the open doors.

Had I known AC was limited to the bedrooms, I wouldn’t have rented the house.

General issues:
1) I am requesting a refund of the $60.00 fee for early entry.  We arrived at 3:45 p.m. and encountered difficulties opening the lockbox.  It took about 30 minutes to open the lock box and 2 calls to Michelle to finally figure out how to open the lockbox. Instructions should have been provided.
2) The contract clearly states that the departure time is at 11:00 am.  On the morning of Mar. 30th, I received a voicemail advising me that my party should have exited by 10:00 a.m.

I was then charged $60.00 for the late departure.  All but one of the guests departed before 10:00 a.m. and the last guest exited at 11:00 a.m., but was waiting for her Uber ride outside the property with her bags when the housekeeper arrived. (She observed the housekeeper also had a lot of difficulty opening the lockbox.) To charge $60.00 for a late departure is unreasonable.

3) All the bathrooms ran out of toilet paper and we had to go out and buy our own.
4) After the first night, I called Michelle about some of the above issues and her response was only to say she “walked through the house 6 times”.  Apparently, simply “walking through” is not sufficient. Perhaps turning on a light switch might be more proactive.

Our stay at this property fell well short of our expectations. We should not have to endure a lack of hot water and toilet paper, bathroom noises, disturbed sleep, a dark bedroom, getting trapped in the bathroom, and glass in the shower floor, etc.

This was a trip I had planned for my guests and looked forward to for over six months.  It was disappointing and embarrassing to host them in a house that was so lacking in comfort and amenities.<//Text>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><text>Hi Grand Welcome,

It was a grand welcome when we arrived at #6-302 at Kona Maki! Such a relief to walk into the cool condo to find a small light on and the A/C running. Although we have hardly used the A/C since, for us coming from a cool climate it was a relief to not have to cool the condo down in order to sleep well on our first night.  Thanks to your team for the thoughtful service!
We Love this location!  It’s a wonderful spot. Far enough from town but close to take a walk in for breakfast or Happy Hour! Also we really like the condo 😊!  We could tell by the pictures it’s a bit dated but does the trick and the bed is comfortable!
Super appreciative of the fans in the unit and the little extras like necessary condiments, ice maker in the fridge, coffee grinder/filters and decent blender!
The View is Beautiful and this place seems to attract friendly people.
Grand Welcome did a great job keeping in touch with us by email to ensure we were happy with everything and had all that we need the day we arrived. When we called to ask for a couple of things Susan was very helpful and took awesome care of us! Her response time was exceptional and an added touch! Thanks Susan!
In addition, the property managers on site are very nice and their crews keep the grounds spic and span! Gorgeous flowers/trees everywhere on this property! The pool is a great size.
We are grateful that there is well labeled on site recycling/garbage cans.  We were encouraged also by the solar panels on the roof tops showing that this place is smart to capitalize on the energy benefit from the ample sunshine here! The unit has snorkel/boogie board/beach chairs/umbrella for the beach gear.

Place was nice and clean upon arrival. Thank you to all!

We look forward to booking here again soon! Especially because we booked through Grand Welcome and their service was awesome.

Oh yeah we also saw TWO rare green flashes at sunset from the handy BBQ’s on the main deck!

Big Mahalo to the owners for making their condo available to us!

<Text>With two bathrooms and three bedrooms this Surf & Racquet Club condo worked great for vacationing with family or friends - or by ourselves. The kitchen is fully equipped so we could cook in or go out. The condo's location was ideal for exploring places (both to the south and the north). We especially enjoyed having Kahulu'u Beach so close. We could swim each day and enjoy seeing the fish and turtles. We rented a car and loved taking Alii Drive into town but we could have taken the trolley....So relaxing to watch the sunset each night at the little beach next door.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>If I could rate this a zero that is what this company deserves. Worst Customer service ever! They false advertise their service as being outstanding from other rental businesses when there is definitely not someone 24/7 to help you in your time of need.  On feb. 25 I left the cabin rental and shortly after I discovered that I had forgotten 3 things: a cleanser, a facial brush and a watch that had been gifted to me and that I had emotional attachment to. I called them the same day and left a voicemail. I proceeded to do this 2 more days leaving voicemails and I did not receive any type of call back or anything about my belongings until I discovered their email and had to resend the same email inquiring about my property 3 times!! Amy Escalante is the person that emailed back and again day after day of me having to go above and beyond to locate my personal items was not helpful whatsoever. In the very few scarce emails that she actually responded, she told me she was going to contact me when she found the information about where my stuff was. When I finally got a direct phone number to inquire about my belongings  after 2 WEEKS! all she had to say to me was "it was there" I do not understand how my property can not be where I specifically communicated where I had left it. And I called to report it the same day! This being my first time going to Tahoe AND staying in one of these rentals was definitely a nightmare. I 100% do not recommend this company because they do not care about their customers, nor to help them retrieve their personal belongings when it was left behind. The service is attrocious and I would not recommend them to my friends or family seeing how they can STEAL a customers personal belongings. To have saved for months and plan to  make a memorable weekend trip with friends and family is really disappointing to have the last memories of stealing of my personal belongings, my property, all because the company that we booked with was negligent to its customers.</review><name>Andre Fahoy</name><Date>1552439931733</Date><gmapID>0x80dd4bb3f478b09d:0xcdcc24e0f6697ca9< /gmapID><Rating>1<//Rating><resp>None<//resp>< UserId.>

Grand Welcome's office wasn't open when we arrived at 3:30 pm. We picked up our package from their "drop box", but they had not included a code for the door, so we couldn't get in to our place. We had no cell phone coverage or wifi, so got help from a lady in a nearby motel who let us use their wifi. We called Grand Welcome's emergency number. The man who answered put us on hold for over 15 minutes. We called back and were put on hold again. About an hour later, we got an email saying someone would meet us at the house with the code. By this time, it was almost 7:00, three hours past check-in time. The house hadn't been cleaned after the last guests departed. There were no clean sheets or towels (all towels were in the bathtubs), and the kitchen and bathrooms were really dirty. It tookuntil 1:00 the next afternoon to get us another place - and this time, they didn't provide the wifi password. We had to drive 30 minutes away to get wifi so we could contact Grand Welcome, and it took a few more hours before we were finally settled in a clean place wifi - 27 hours in all. All Grand Welcome offered was $119.00 for the first night - but we paid $225 per night. Their offer does not compensate for our stress, miserable first night, and all the hassles because of Grand Welcome's incompetence and lack of service.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

< review>
What can I say?  We had just an incredibly good time in the apartment. Location great, view amazing, furnishings perfect.  We did not want to leave.  Being on the second floor was great and even though there were folks next to us on the same level (but different building) it was very quiet at night.  We cooked and ate most of our meals in the condo -  why go out and spend a lot of money on so-so food when you have the best dining view in Kona?  We are somewhat "foodies" and were glad that there was an excellent grocery store very near the condo. Also some good take out places near by.  Movie theatre was also nice to have in walking distance.  Definitely, we will be back.

But a few suggestions (the reason for 4 stars rather than 5)

1. Our check-in material did not have the correct entry code for the main gate and we were just lucky to be able to follow another car in at night before the gate closed.  We got the code from a nice neighbor.

2.  The Wifi log in and password that you gave us did not work.  Luckily, we had a tech savvy person with us and he got the log in off the back of the router and then the password was default.  Log in was: MySpectrumWifi98-5G and password was fancystate539.  Also, we had a a problem watching Netflix movies - way too much buffering.  We finally gave up. We could watch with no problem on our smaller devices so it was not an issue with the strength of the signal.  I think you should take a look at the whole Wifi set up to be sure folks can stream videos.

3. The kitchen was very well equipped.  Only thing missing:  a good knife sharpener.< /review>

Grand Welcome has kept sending me emails asking for my review. Unfortunately for them, my review is not the best. This review is not about the places they manage, which are often great. This review is about the Grand Welcome company: If you are the owner of a property thinking of having them manage your place, or a prospective client who might have technical issues with your rental, I recommend you do not proceed in dealing with Grand Welcome. Their services were some of some of the worst I have experienced in a long time. Their communications were mediocre: They did not give accurate information about the place we rented from them, and they reacted defensively when I called out their miscommunications. We ended up having an OK time at our rental and we were able to get a reimbursement for part of it because Airbnb, whose site we used to find the rental, was kind enough to reimburse a part of the fee and negotiate with Grand Welcome to reimburse the rest. Grand Welcome should have reimbursed all of it but they were too defended to admit their fault. There were several things that did not work or needed repair at our rental and Grand Welcome did not take care of them before our arrival.

Never again, until and if they ever change their management and policies.

ADDENDUM (after Grand Welcome's reply): More evidence of their poor customer service. The issues we had with the place were: leaking roof, broken light fixture, broken sliding glass door, broken grill, unclear instructions on how to use the heater (it took us a day and a half of our 2-day stay to figure out how to use it properly), and the wifi was not working, which made it impossible for us to contact anyone. Please check your records carefully. It was not only the wifi that was an issue.< /review>

Worst rental experience I've ever had. Our weekend getaway turned into us cleaning up pink liquid leaking from the attic in the bathroom and not being able to shower due to a broken shower head. Needed a slide key to get into the pool and hot tub but couldn't find the security office at Tamarack because it isn't on the map. The customer service would tell me they "couldn't do much because they are in California." Now that I'm asking for my money back or a discount they are telling me their manager is gone for three weeks. I will never stay with VVR(now grand welcome) again and recommend looking elsewhere.
Looks like they were bad before but now that they are under grand welcome it’s gotten even worse. Reporting these people to the BBB.

-4 weeks later I still haven’t heard one word.

DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY! STAY AWAY!<//Review>

Horrible customer service...

Rented a unit as I do for my family each year and the unit had a broken oven and ice machine $2700 dollars and broken appliances.... Called maintenance they came later in the evening said they could not fix and would be back in the am. Never called or showed up. I called and they said maybe in an hour and a half. Did not show so I called again. Another hour and a half. I said this is a high inconvenience to me and my family and she did not care. Asked it I wanted to cancel the maintenance request I said if you can’t pin point a time yes as long as someone compensates me for thanksgiving dinner. I can’t cook with no over.

I had to spend several hundred dollars at the store for dinner for 10 people. Had to go to store daily for ice as well.

Asked for a supervisor several times only to be ignored asked to br compensated for my out of pocket expenses and was sent an e mail from customer “ compensation denied non negotiable “ now that is making things right

Highly recommend not rentin from this company

This are good so no need for customer service. Only arrogance. What will you do for customers when things are not so good< /Text>

Terrible customer service! We have been renting from Valet Vacation rentals for nine years, and this was the first year we’ve rented since they became/we’re bought by Grand Welcome. We arrived to our ski resort townhome over Thanksgiving to find a large out of order/danger sign on the fireplace, and quickly realized the wi-fi didn’t work. I left a message explaining the issues and asking for a call back. We were there for four days and never received a call back. When I emailed after the trip, they had a hard time locating my reservation. Once they figured it out, they told me the fire place WAS working and that the sign should have been removed. So, no fire place for no reason! Small issues included 59 degrees inside upon arrival, no snow shovel, large amount of oil in oven that smoked us out (until I cleaned the oven), and missing several basic kitchen items.

The ultimate response I received was that when I boom again, they will offer me a discount coupon if one is available at that time. There will NOT be a next time. Pretty sad after having rented from Valet probably 15 times. I guess this is what happens when ownership/management moves out of state. Utterly disappointed in Idaho.</Text>

Would NOT recommend Grand Welcome for your stay. We spent the evening in a home that was freezing cold (45F) and after numerous hours of a nice but inept manager trying to fix the issue, we finally asked for a new place to stay. They downgraded us to an old home with fewer bathrooms, and beds without mattresses (thin foam pads only). Come to find out the new home had two bedrooms without electricity or heat, so we had to sleep in our full winter gear to stay warm. On notifying them of the issue, they said they'd get an electrician (who never showed up) and that we'd be compensated for our difficulties. On return, when we repeatedly called customer service requesting compensation, we were told we would be only refunded a fraction of our stay and that we should have moved homes the second night given the circumstances but that since we stayed they wouldn't refund us further. The option to move homes the second night was not offered and it was only later that we found out there were plenty of nicer places to stay but that they didn't think our troubles warranted the nicer places and that the second place had a hot tub so we should've been happy with that (although no one had swim suits as we weren't planning on having a hot tub). They were extremely unhelpful and unwilling to admit their negligence. Regret having booked a stay with them but will not book another place with them in the future.<//review>

The kitchen applicences  were in good shape, as was the bed. We have stayed at Kona Bali Kai many times with Sunquest Vacations and this was the worst unit we have been in it was not worth the $4000 it cost us for two weeks.</Text><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80dd4bb3f478b09d:0xcdcc24e0f6697ca9< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We had a wonderful stay. I was worried about getting there in the dark with a Taxi and not knowing where to go but they were very helpful and I looked for the parking number and knew to go up infront of it. 3 flights of stairs could deter someone with health issues but we loved the excersise.

Inside was awesome, we had everything we needed and the view was absolutley beautiful and the recliner chairs on the deck were a really great place to watch the sun go down; read a book and sip a glass of wine. Grocery store was nice and close and we enkoyed the beaches down the street. The bed in the master was really comfortable so that is the biggest thing is getting a good night sleep. I wont write anything negetive because its not worth saying the little things that dont make a difference.<//Text>

I recommend you take advantage of the private beach club  with the adjoining restaurant “ Napua”.  Unit comes with a parking pass that makes beach access easy

< Review>
(Translated by Google) A family of four went to Kailua-Kona on the Big Island of Hawaii. I stayed at a condominium called Kailua Bay Resort # 3301, which was very reasonable but had enough facilities for a long term stay. In particular, we had equipment (parasols, snorkeling masks, fins, etc.) for playing in the sea, so we could use it for free. There were two bedrooms and two shower rooms (with toilets), so we could spend a relaxing time with a family of four. The kitchen also had cooking utensils and utensils, plates, forks and spoons.
The service of the condominium management company was also very good. When my wife accidentally broke the coffee maker and contacted the management company by email, the next day I received a new coffee maker and was very surprised. I was so impressed that I was notified that I didn't need any money to break the coffee maker!
There were Longs Drugs and TKA around the condominium, and there were also Ross Dress for Less and Macy's if you extended a little, so it was a very convenient place.
I want to use it again when I go to the Big Island with my family!

(Original)
家族４人でハワイ島のカイルア・コナに行ってきました。宿泊したのは Kailua Bay Resort #3301 と言うコンドミニアムで、とてもリーズナブルですが長期宿泊するのに十分な設備が整っていました。特に海で遊ぶめの備品（パラソルやシュノーケリング・マスク、フィンなど）が揃っていて無料で使うことができました。ベッドルームも二つ、シャワールーム（トイレ付）も二つあり、４人家族でゆったりと過ごすことができました。また、キッチンも調理器具や道具、お皿やフォーク・スプーンも用意されていました。
コンドミニアムの管理会社のサービスもとてもよかったです。妻が誤ってコーヒーメーカーを壊してしまい、メールで管理会社に連絡すると翌日には新しいコーヒーメーカー届いていて、とても驚きました。さらにコーヒーメーカーを壊した代金も必要ないと連絡を貰って大感激でした！
コンドミニアムの周りにはLongs DrugsやTKA、少し足を延ばせばRoss Dress for Lessやメイシーズなどもあり、とても便利な場所でした。
また家族でハワイ島に行くときには、また利用したいです！<//Review>

My visit to West Coast Center for Orthopedic Surgery was exceptional in my opinion. The per-screen out side the office was proficient and exact. The front desk was professional and timely.
I started my appointment on time or before.
Everyone that I spoke with period to seeing the doctor was knowledgeable and engaged.
From the X-rays tech to the analysis of clarity of my  condition, up to the time I saw Dr. Fader, I consider it to have been an exception visit. I’m grateful to the office and my friend that recommended me.
Thank you very much,....</text>

<Text>I felt Dr FEDERS assistant listened to me, and wasn’t trying to run to the next patient. He was thorough and explained to the best of his knowledge what my results were and what action would be taken next. Therapy for my back, and we’ll review in 30 days.
The office is very pleasant, staff included.< /Text>< resp>

<Text>I’ve been a patient of Dr. Carol Frey’s for about 9 years.  She’s an excellent orthopedic surgeon specializing in ankle & foot problems.  I have been plagued with plantar fasciitis with calcaneal heel spurs which she’s taken care of through out the years.  She usually gives me my cortisone injection and I am good for a few years. Dr Frey takes the time to listen to her patients, is attentive and not to mention an excellent bedside manner!  Dr Frey has magical hands.  Dr Frey deserves +10 ⭐️ but 5 was the max.  I even referred my sister and she has nothing but good things to say about Dr Frey.  Her staff is wonderful too!  Dana her office manager is really helpful.<//Text><user_name>marisela gonzalez</user_name><rating>5</rating></record>

<text>I’ve had two previous shoulder surgeries by another surgeon with poor results. Twenty years of discomfort and pain was becoming unbearable until Dr. Feder took over.

<review>Very nice and comfortable waiting room, it gets full as we wait for our name to be called.  There is seating outside. The staff here are so friendly and nice.  Now Dr. Feder is very nice and so professional. When it comes to business his staff already knows what he wants and they are there. For your first time be prepared to spend at least 2 hours. Enjoy your visit.< /review>< Resp>

When you walk in you it’s not even like you’re going to a doctors office, it’s like you’re walking into a gathering of friends.
-all of the staff there are friendly and welcoming
-everyone is very cordial
-even if you see a lot of people in the waiting area, you will still be seen within 10 of your appointment time
-very smooth in and out transition
-my intake the 2 times I have been has been done by Marsha she is very great at her job at making you feel comfortable while asking you what seems like 50 million questions.
-you can tell doctor fader and his staff are well educated and run a very tight and smooth ship
-and it is very convenient that the therapy is right next door
-if you’ve been here before, it is really no reason to go anywhere else west coast really is the best place if you’re an athlete, law enforcement officer,man even a everyday 9-5 worker who need some therapy. At west coast you’re treated like family.<//Text>

They can relate to and help active, athletic population. Highly recommend even more so if restoring proper movement and function is a priority.

When you walk into the front doors and into the waiting area you can’t help to notice how Clean it is.
They check you in quickly and the wait time is not long at all. Within minutes I was called back told what was going to happen, and was shown to the changing room.  When I finished Changing  into the scrubs they  provided they showed me into the MRI room explained what was going to happen again and hooked me up and finished my MRI.
The entire process was quick and easy.

Wait time not bad at all, and the physical work up they did for me was the best I've ever had.  The staff communicates well and are friendly.  Dr Feder is warm and explains details understandably.

After an awful experience and prognosis from an Orthopedist in Long Beach, I came to came Dr. Frey for a second opinion.  She is a consummate professional.  It was like watching a maestro at their craft.  Not only did she renew my hope that there’s a solution to my Achilles Tendonitis, she took the time to explain the options and laid out a clear path from least invasive to most.  It was an amazing visit and I can’t wait to see the results of the treatment plan we worked together to establish.<//Text>

Both my husband & I are patients if Dr. Feder. We consider Dr. Feder one of the best if not the best in Orthopedic practice. He has greatly improved our mobility. The only issue is the wait in his office. This issue has greatly improved lately, nothing more than any medical office wait. We strongly recommend him< /Text>

<text>I am seeing Dr Feder for a recurring issue with pain in my right knee. I had surgery 3 years ago and the pain has never really subsided. Dr Feder’ a staff has been excellent and very helpful in getting appointments. Dr Feder is very thorough and seems genuinely interested in helping you. Very happy I found West Coast Center and Dr Feder for my care.</text><gmap_id>0x80c2b3f8a2495b95:0x32fe4a9f113b0702<//gmap_id><Rating>5<//Rating>< pictures>

I have been seeing dr. Fede 4 / 20 years she has treated me with great respect and has listened to me when I had specific complaints and concerns. his office staff has always been friendly and warm and they too have listened to me when I have had specific concerns or complaints. The only concern I have ever had is on occasion you may have to wait awhile to see Doctor Feder.<//review>

The staff at West Coast are amazing. Eventhough they are extremely busy, they all go out of their way to take care of me. No question goes unanswered, and it seems almost impossible to attend to everyone with that much patience and a smile, but they do. My only complaint would be that, they need a larger holding/reception area because I guess when everyone likes you, no one wants to miss their appointment and it has a tendency to get a little crowded, and that's still a positive for any business.
Sincerely,

Ms.Sebrena D.Harrison<//text>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>Dr. Feder has treated me for the past 15 plus years.  I must say, no matter what the issues are, Dr. Feder has taken the time to listen and address each of them with overwhelming long-term success.  I have endured numerous work-related injuries, some requiring surgery.  One, in particular, was a four-part major surgery procedure that I just was not sure I wanted to undertake.  With no pressure from Dr. Feder, yet reassurance that it would help me return to some form of normalcy.  I must say, it was an uphill battle, but Dr. Feder was right.  I was once again able to do many of the activities that came to a halt.  Also, I cannot express sincere appreciation for each and everyone one of Dr. Feder's support staff.  From the front desk to the back office.  Like any successful company, without a frontline staff, all you have is an office of people moving about.  There are too many names to list, but they know who they are.  If you need someone to hold your hand, follow-up with Work-Comp, correct paperwork, forward req documents to your job, set-up ref- appointments, notify your PT, schedule upcoming surgeries, exhibit patients when taking info each visit, a listening ear during x-rays, just to name a few.  I can go on and on.   I have referred many family and friends to Dr. Feder, and without fail, he and his staff have faithfully provided them with the outermost outstanding care.  For that, I say thank you.  I cannot leave this out.  I know sometimes the wait seems long when waiting to be seen from time to time. As mother use to say, "Some things are worth waiting for."  When it comes to one's health, hands down, what's a little wait time.

Not only is Dr. Feder and the staff, my preference of choice, they are like family to me.  I love each and every one of them.  Can I add five more starts?<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Dr. Feder's expertise was instrumental in diagnosing my wife. After an accident that happened over a year ago, Dr. Feder identified a tear in her labrum, the lining of the hip joint. We are talking with their office now about non-invasive treatment options that will help with the pain and get her on the road to recovery. Thanks Dr. Feder and your wonderful staff.< /Text>

I cant wait to see the new locale.When I got my ink redone at the old location,they were very clean and safe throughout the whole time I was there. Jose is a fabulous artist and all around good guy.  They all are for that matter. My work of art was rendered exactly how we discussed and you can see cleanliness is a more than a habit. The price was fair and they added a little work for free too. Very nice guys. Treated me like an old friend, were aware of my needs and put up with my gift of gab. Oh did I tell you it was clean there? I had no worries . If (when ) I have another need of ink, I will return to Radiant ink to have it done.<//text>< Pictures>

We really enjoyed being tattooed by Josh. He was able to fit all three of us in on very short notice, and did a great job besides. He had a really soft touch (I got my tattoos done on my hands) and they healed fast, without any issues or scabbing. I'm looking forward to going back again soon!</Review>

<review>My friend made appointments for all four of us to get tattooed by Josh Gill. We were told that the whole day was open so it wouldn't be a problem and then when we got there the shop was closed. We attempted to contact him but received no response. Not showing up was very unprofessional and my friends and I took our business else where.< /review>< Pictures>

If you're planning on getting some work done, you have to check this shop out. Josh is a phenomenal artist and his prices are great. Had a good experience and everyone there was very personable. I'll be back!<//text>

<text>Josh at Radiant Ink is by far the best Tattoo Artist. I would have given him a 1000 star review.  Josh will listen to exactly what you want and will give you exactly what you want. Josh's ability to use and make the coIors pop off of your skin, his shading is spot on, lines are tight. I was surprised as to how it wasn't painful like my other tattoos. I received the most beautiful Cockatiel Tattoo on my forearm, it was a cover up from the mess that Chris at Eye of Jade did.  I HIGHLY recommend going here. The best way to make an appointment with Josh Gill is through Facebook on Messenger or  go down to the shop. That's how I did it. Take a peek at his updated binder while your there. Watercolor Tattoos are so beautiful. Josh is not afraid to use lots of colors.<//text>< Pictures>

I was still somewhat unsure as to where on my arm I wanted to start my sleeve...Anywhere else they would have told me to come back when I made a decision.

Despite being busy, Josh took the time to really go over the development of my sleeve I had in mind. I genuinely felt like he cared about it as much as I did.

I haven't gotten any tattoos in while, particularly due to the fact that all of the shops that I've felt out in the past were filled with tools with a superiority complex, and I refuse to give them my business.

I will definitely be back to finish the sleeve, plus many more after that.< /Text>< Pictures>

My ex girlfriend got a uv peacock tattoo that turned out BEAUTIFUL it was done by Keith and he was dealing with a difficult client at the end of the tattoo and I'm not just sayin that cause she is my ex lol.He was VERY patient and professional until she was happy. Like One of those picky clients like on ink masters bad lol. But I'm going to see him for my first tattoo by him and I'm not that kind of client. Very clean shop and great atmosphere no doubt that I will get what I want from Keith.</text>

<text>Open, 24 hrs excellent service, watch your food as its prepped and guys are on point, only problem is that if your starving at 2am, tons of choices from Asada to cabeza and may take you a while to decide from a huge menu and if you need to sit and eat, they got you covered...Dub H gives it a rare 5 ...enjoy 😉</text>< Pictures>

<Text>I got shimp tacos. The flavor and seasoning was really good. I just think the tortillas should be a little toasted on the grill to add firmness and flavor. I couldn't even really pick up the shrimp tacos like a because they fell apart in my hand. Maybe some people like that? I certainly don't. I don't like soggy. If they were just fried a little on the grill they would've been great.< /Text>< Rating>

I used to come here as a kid and absolutely loved it. My visits home have always been too short to visit though until today. It's been at least 10 years since I've been here, but besides the large LCD menu display and new-ish chairs, nothing has changed! The food tastes just as amazing and authentic today as it did so many years ago. A must have if you're craving authentic mexican food!</text>

I'm never disappointed here. Been to almost all their locations and maybe not THEE best but definitly very very good food. Enough so to keep a taco lover like myself coming back every chance I get... 3 tacos de pollo con todo, and a burrito al pastor con todo and a large Tamarindo to wash it all down... Never can go wrong< /Review>

< Review>
Best street tacos anywhere.  As a matter of fact, one of my friends had her cousin and nephew visit from Mexico.  The visitors wanted some good Mexican food.  Bought pollo and carne asada tacos, rice and beans.  Our visitors thought it was better than the restaurant food from home (Mexico).  Need I say more...  Double thumbs up!</Review>

This place has great tacos. They're small, but really tasty. They are open 24 hours a day (at least the drive-thru is). The parking lot is a bit small, but if you go when they're not busy, then you shouldn't have issues with parking. I had 3 tacos (I tend to go a bit non-traditional, so bear with me). I had one tongue taco, one head taco, and one tripas (intestines) taco. They have the regular carne asada, carnitas, chicken, etc. as well. They have burritos, quesadillas, and similar items, but their main thing is the tacos. Bathrooms are clean, too. :)< /text>

Ordered a breakfast burrito against my better judgement. Tried my best to convince myself that it was good and I just couldn't do it. Called to see what they would DO-ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.  Poor customer service from management. Was told "that's how they make it and sorry I didn't like it.<//review>

The food is good but, I've noticed over the last year or two the burritos are getting smaller , and the prices have increased. I still go but, not as often as I use to.</review>

Open 24 hours but they only have one breakfast burrito, and it's not even on the menu! They don't even serve coffee! Who does this? The burrito was delicious, but all that flavor comes from the grease, which is more than excessive. Enough grease to lubricate the Tin Man.< /text>

This is my go to taco place when I don't want King Taco or Tacos Los Primos.  I had their Menudo on a Sunday afternoon because I was feeling nostalgic.  It totally delivered and reminded me of Saturday mornings with my folks in East LA.  Love love love their carne asada, chicken, and buche tacos!  Love the salsas too!</Review>

The burritos are made too small now. I've had heard it from everyone in town, but I now experienced it with my own eyes.

This is my go-to for authentic tacos. Their buche and lengua are delicious and well-cooked. I recommend the burritos and try their green sauce. The flour tortillas are great tasting but quite fragile, so beware of eating while driving.< /Text>

<review>It was my first time returning in a couple years and sadly was disappointed. Not ONLY in the quality of the food but by the vagrant who begged for money from my friend and I. Upon getting money from someone else out front, he went in bought his order, came right back out to harass us mumbling in Spanish.<//review>< Pictures>

Carnitas was so greasy. All you could taste was rancid oil. My wife said the carne asada bowl was ok. Nothing special. The eating area was very dirty. Sad this place has gone downhill so much. Been eating tacos at the Fullerton location for over 15 years.< /Text>

We haven't been here for about 3 years. Drove by them the other day. Decided to have my husband pick up dinner tonight. He went inside and placed an order for 4 each of chicken, beef and pork tacos, side of beans and rice.
We live less then a mile from there. Sat down and opened the foil just to see mush!!! The tacos were squished so tight into the foil that there was no way to separate any if it!  Steam or whatever made the tortillas actually dissolve. Absolutely disgusting. We thought maybe 1 could be saved. But nope. We had flour tortillas here at home. So thought we would try the meat that way. It was such a mess my husband was pi&@ed And picked it up threw it all in the trash. Oh btw it was $30 bucks too. That's why he was so mad too.
We called placed on hold and disconnected! My husband did why bother apparently this place is so bad anymore no one cares.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Order a burrito to carry. The service is good, but the food ... For me the meat was a little hard I think it lacked something more preparation.

This is my opinion I do not like it but that does not mean that someone else does not find it very good.

(Original)
Ordene un burrito para llevar. El servicio es bueno, pero la comida... Para mí la carne estaba algo dura creo le faltó algo mas de preparación.

<Review>(Translated by Google) The attention is very good, no complaints, but the food I think has lowered its quality, the meats too dry and tasteless, it is not the same as it was years ago, apart from the fact that they no longer have grilled onions, which was a plus for the tacos.

(Original)
La atención muy buena, no quejas,pero la comida creo que ha bajado mucho su calidad, las carnes demasiado secas y sin sabor, ya no es lo mismo de años atras,amén de que ya no tienen cebollas asadas que era un plus para los tacos.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Oh my goodness!!! Coming back from the Ag show and we were thirsty for a beer and googled this place.  So glad we did!!!!! I ended up ordering the ground beef tacos and they were to die for.  I never order tacos out because my mom always made the best and no one compared so why risk it.  Well these ranked right up there with them.  The salsa was the perfect amount of spicy but it didn't linger and great flavor.  The gal who served us was adorable and I believe she did the cooking also.  I can't wait to go back.  Simple things...</Text><Response>None</Response>< rating>

It's the local Cheers! Apple and Poppsie are the owners and they are amazing people!!  The food is flavor packed and always made fresh! They reserve the entire place for special events. Always good people and good times!<//Review>

<review>It's a typical in & out gas station. Often too crowded for comfort. For me. No special pricing on gas, they do have air & the store right there isn't very well equiped. So there are other less stress places for gas & beverages. Cheaper gas to. It's convenient.  That's the draw. Too many ppl there getting gas. Bob M<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Well, the gas station itself wasn't too bad. The problem was the homeless and the tweakers hanging outside of it. It didn't feel safe. One guy who didn't they have a mask, came out of the bathroom wearing this.</Text>

I agree with many other reviews!  These people have always been RUDE! Just money hungry S.O.B.'s!  The restrooms are " always " out of order!  WHERE DO THEY GO? $75 in gas but cannot use their restrooms!</Text>

The pump wouldn't take my card.
So had to go in and wait in line. Then the pump/nozzle wouldn't work. So instead of coming to see if they could help they told me to try another pump! The service was just poor!<//Review>

Fast gas. If you need to go potty, you might as well pass. Restrooms are not working anytime I get gas there at least once a month for the last 5 years. Watch out for that right hand door when you go inside, It doesn't work. Use the left door.<//Text>

Cheap gas, lotsa snax, easy access, and always open. How can you go wrong. This particular location is family owned, so great service.< /Review>

<rate>1</rate><text>The reason that I give this place such a low rating is because of the people that own and run it. I am an older woman in a wheelchair with an unconventional look and although I came in to buy some coolant for my car they told me that the restroom was out of order which was not true. I saw them giving the key to others who went in and out. Perhaps they thought I was Indigent which is not true and where extremely  unkind.< /text>< Pics>

Gas isnt the same. The quality of this gas is different, I dont get the same miles that I did a few months ago. The increase of cost doesnt matter. The quality just isnt the same and I only get my gas from ARCO...</review>

<Review>We just bought our 4th car from Jim's auto and they still offer the same excellent customer service ever. It's something about them going out of their way to help you and make you feel comfortable especially if you're not sure about the decision you're about to make. Andy is the best! He always greets you with a smile and he takes really great care of his customers. Sam loves to make you laugh,so if you walk in there nervous, you won't be in a matter of seconds with Sam. Whether you're looking for a small car, an SUV or if you're a truck fan....Jim's Auto in Harbor City is the place to be. They won't just sell you a car, they'll make sure it's a vehicle that you will love!< /Review><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1617034046338, 'text': "Tania, Thank you so much for sharing your fantastic experience with us. It makes us happy when we meet our best customers expectations. We agree, Andy and Sam are amazing and such a vital part of our team. We're glad they were able to put you at ease about your decision. We can't wait to work with you again in the future!"}<//response>< Gmap_id>

<text>I have been buying vehicles from Jim’s for the last 14 years. My wife, my kids and many family members. I have shopped at many other dealers previously but nobody comes close to these guys. Awesome customer service, no hassle or pressure there vehicles sell themselves. They do some really cool things to there trucks and Jeeps too that no other dealerships do. Most lots install cheap aftermarket parts to give it the look. No quality though. Half of there trucks have fox shocks, bulletproof lift kits. Surprising that stuff isn’t cheap. Richard in finance is great. Recently bought my wife’s Jeep there for her surprise Christmas present. Thought I would try my credit union for financing thinking it would make it easier. After him looking at my pre approval he found me and even better rate. I was pretty surprised he was able to do that. Highly recommend this place to anybody. Great family owned dealer. Thanks again guys!< /text>< name>

Horrible Horrible Horrible! Bought a Jeep in December 2020 & is a complete disaster. Jeep had to go into the shop 2 weeks later for head gaskets & other BIG repairs. Tried to get Jim to repair or pay for the cost NO response. Horrible service & a total lemon. DON'T SHOP HERE SAVE YOUR MONEY & GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!</text>

Worked with Sam on an Excursion I was very interested in. I ended up not buying it, but to no fault of Sam or the dealerships. Sam is very professional, worked a great deal for me, and followed up well. Definitely not a pushy used car dealership. They made me feel at ease, and helped pick out a great car. I highly recommend this place, and Sam Delami in particular.< /Review>

<text>This place has fantastic customer service. Seriously. Mike and Jerry are super friendly, enthusiastic but totally on the level. They actually want what's best for, you... Plus, they gave me way more than I anticipated for my trade in. Bonus! I was out in no time at all, too
Best car buying experience I have ever had. .</text></record>

<text>I’m one of the happiest customer ever with Jim’s auto sales. I already purchased 3 cars from them and I’m very happy with the quality of service and the amazing deals on reliable cars. I had the honor to be assisted by Jim himself who came out to support his amazing sales managers. They were all nice and very polite to me and sooooo patient since I’m somehow very hard to convince. I don’t think of another place to purchase a car.
Thank you so very much Jim’s Auto. I love all my cars from you! Specially the 2012 Nissan Murano that I’m myself driving. Keep up the good job!<//text>< pics>

Bought a 2012 Toyota Prius Plug-in(33k miles) on March 2018. After seeing this car on their website, I called the day before asking if I can take a look at it. Mike brought it down all the way from fontana. When I got there the next morning all the salesman and employees were very friendly and welcoming. I do Smog checks and auto repair so I have experience and knowledge about cars. They gave me all the time I needed to take a look at the car. I even brought my little scanner to see if everything was okay with it. The interior and exterior were in mint condition. After driving it around for a month back and forth to school and work, I have not gotten any surprises. I love the customer service I received. I will return for future purchases.< /review>

I have bought 2 cars from here. First I got the Raptor, I named it Belly the Street Sweeper. When I was done I took it back to them and because Raptors had gone up in value since I bought it I was able to get nearly what I paid for it. I then bought the Tacoma I have now. I named that the Pink Taco Smasher. They leveled the truck for me and got the connect on Fuel wheels and tires. I've also sold them a few cars too. They pay more than Carmax and that's the real deal.< /text>

I was kind of weary about buying a used car, but after walking around the lot, speaking to a very proffessional saleswoman, my mind was set at ease. She told me that they would not hesitate in giving me a car fax on any of their vehicles and that i wld have a 30 day warranty on motor and transmission. Jims auto sales has beautiful cars, unlike alot of these used car lots I've been to. I did find a beautiful vehicle, which i purchased, and i have had no need to bother these good people. My car looks and runs like a new vehicle, and i haves NO REGRETS with my purchase. THANK YOU JIMS AUTO FOR SUCH A SATISFYING EXPERIENCE!< /Review>< Time>

< review>
gotta say im dissapointed i purchased here i could have bought my car at a place that actually knows service- at first the sales man was very nice when i bought the car writing a check with his mouth HIS DEALERSHIP CANT CASH the truck had problems almost the 2nd day i bought it and when i took it back to get repaired the service and communication was horrible (forget about going to work or counting on your car being ready on time) so once the cars get in they are driven by the most IGNORANT TECHS i have had the shame to take my vehicle to LEARN HOW TO DRIVE IDIOTS! is all i gotta say and their repairs are lousy and the cars are never repaired correctly i rather take care of it on my own than take it back to them...BE AWARE BUYING HERE ASK FOR CARFAX AND GET YOUR CAR INSPECTED BEFORE PURCHASE DO NOT BE A FOOL!

well hope it helps<//review>

<Text>I was selling my truck and had a bad experience at CarMax with how long they quoted me and how long they were actually going to take to process the transaction once I was there. I called Ricky at Jim’s and he had me in and out of the dealership in 20 minutes. No hassles and he was super cool. Highly recommend selling your car here.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Very beautiful stained glass windows. A nice Catholic Church next door to the Paramount Swap Meet. I enjoyed the service there. I have taken some pictures of the inside of the Church, hopefully they will post, and you can see.<//Text>

Ooh my!! What a lovely church and great people.
This parish made me feel like a family member. The Parish Priest Fr Julio and associate Fr Segundo were very welcoming.

<Review>This is an extremely busy post office but the staff are always courteous and helpful.  A wait is not unusual especially near holidays but they have 3 machines for mailing packages so I rarely spend more than 15 minutes there even at busy times.  Staff are unsung heroes for sure.</Review></record>

I run an Etsy business and take my packages directly here, because it’s the main hub in Encinitas. Other local post offices have to go here next.
They are fast (in delivery), and I never have an issue.
They are polite.
My only complaint is I’ve been offered high prices at the exclusion of all pricing so my daughter is always wondering why I speak loudly and clearly saying, “THE CHEAPEST OPTION.” I get this embarrassed her, but it’s crucial.
Otherwise lines are a pain but self service is available.
Thank you!<//Text>

He was efficient, knowledgeable, and very pleasant and attentive, while also taking care of other customers at the same time. Olivier at the counter sealed the deal with a Hollywood smile and genuine care. Have not been to the San Marcos USPS but, based on today, it’s worth to come to the Encinitas branch just for the customer experience! Thank you :-)<//Review></record></dataset><record>

FRIENDLY SERVICE ! My wife and I popped in here to mail a package to Australia. We were on the way back from Prager Bros in Carlsbad and this location was on the way home. I've never been in here in my life but it is much bigger inside than our local Solana Beach branch. Ha ha but the line of people waiting to be served was just as long. A postal worker named Cesar looked after things.....international stuff seems to take forever to get processed. Eventually we were right to go after about 20 minutes.<//review>

Frustrated! It took me one hour to get out for one international packet.
The lady there was not helpful, I had to go and come and fill again and again. She could take a minute to explain but everything looks like be in rush.
So it was my first time at the post office. Before I went to a ups store and they were really nice explaining everything before sending. I don't know what else to say but I felt really frustrated.
More customer service please and help!<//Review>

Horrible.

One woman is refusing to send my package cause I used a priority sticker label for an international shipment and I am not using the property service.

I cut the top and bottom portion off the sticker so it’s a blank label sticker. Nowhere does it say priority mail. It’s a blank white sticker with the word “TO:” on it and she is refusing.

Is this acceptable? She refused to let me borrow a sharpie cause the whole box is taped up and a regular pen wouldn’t write on it. So, I have to return home and tape piece of paper to cover the label and return to the post office? This is beyond ridiculous.

Our tax dollars at work. Unbelievable.< /review>

WTF what kind of policy is that!? Also I wanted a 3 rd key for my employee to pick up mail but (THEY DONT HAVE ANYMORE KEYS?)  About Customer service - Well its the post office. But the lady with the short red hair really used to irritate me.
We have had a post office box since the early 1980's!! They moved the location over from downtown Encinitas. Oh well , but we had a nice 2 digit number but now we have this 2300xx long number and had to change the zip code - what a pain.  Thats life and progress in Encinitas i Guess?</Text>< Pics>

Horrible service! We always have issues with deliveries at this location! Employees that cannot be fired! Customer service is an optional practise.

I don't usually talk to the postal workers behind the desk, but when i have I've always had a pleasant experience. I've never tried to call this post office on the phone, but i have called others and nobody at any post office answers the phone.  I always expect to have to go in person to talk to someone.  The lobby is big with two multiple automated kiosks.  Plenty of room to work on packages before mailing them.  A separate retail both where you can purchase packing supplies.  Overall a very well-designed facility.< /review>

Customer service will be awesome! The lobby was stellar and even had coffee and doughnuts! I opted for the bagel and cream cheese, but to each their own. The line moved swiftly and a retired Walmart greeter was shaking hands and passing out lollipops while you waited. Again, great job! The bathroom facilities were immaculate and smelled fantastic!

<Text>This post office is the worst I've ever dealt with!  My tracking# says the pkg was delivered but they have no clue where it is. They claim it as been stolen so they don't have to deal with it. Not the 1st time I've had issues with my mail either! One pkg was  was left on top of my box and one in front of my neighbors door! I've gotten someone else's mail multiple times...they clearly do not take notice of the names that are placed at the back of the mailbox. What a joke Encinitas post office is!</Text>< pictures>

Since moving to High Country Villas in March of 2016, my wife and I have experienced a couple of disturbing Encinitas mail carrier-related incidents.
We have had our outgoing mail dropped in the middle of the street by a young male carrier with no satchel. I found three OF MY OUTGOING letters in the street in front of my neighbor's house. When I saw the carrier was just across the street still doing deliveries, I asked him where was his satchel? He said he didn't have one. When I asked how my outgoing mail, which I was now holding, came to be lying in the middle of the street, that carrier said: "oh wow, those must have fallen out of my pocket. Sorry." I originally reported this to Carrie Mannon. This young carrier's apathy and disrespect was blatant, and he didn't seem to care, or at all proud to be a USPS carrier. What happened to the pride of the mail service?
Next, an orange "Beware of Dog" warning form (PS Form 1778) was found BY ME in the middle of MY street while on a random walk with my dog, ironically. Apparently, Edgar had dropped it "by mistake". It had MY home address on it and claimed that "We had a large dog that charged." IF THE HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION GOT A HOLD OF THIS INFORMATION IT MIGHT BE GROUNDS FOR A FINE OR EVEN EVICTION. No one in my neighborhood is allowed to have a large, ill-tempered dog. And we don't. We have a 48-pound, 10-year old female Border Collie who is an extremely well-behaved service animal. I also reported this incident to Carrie Mannon. Edgar, who was the carrier in this incident, displayed a profound apathy, and "who cares" attitude...it was really disappointing. And Ms. Mannon was less than sympathetic listening to my complaint about the mishap!! She went silent in the middle of the conversation, and it was obvious she couldn't wait to hang up, and she could care less as well.
Finally, I phoned today to report another younger USPS carrier on my street with no satchel. He said his name was Happi, and that he forgot his satchel. Happi was here for the first time from Vista, filling in for the day, and had no experience with this route. I was told by Carrie Mannon when I phoned on the two prior occasions, that it was USPS policy that carriers wear a satchel to deliver the mail, to prevent all types of mistakes from happening, especially with new and junior carriers. Today Carrie seemingly changed policy, and said since "it was a light mail day; no one had to wear their satchels."

Are we the only postal customers enduring weird things with the Encinitas mail service??

Ms. Mannon next asked me if I had any outgoing mail today OR had I had an incident today. Both answers were "no". She then went on to say: "well, if nothing bad has happened today, why are you even calling me (AKA why are you bothering me)?

All I really wanted from Ms. Mannon was for her to clarify the policy on USPS carriers using satchels to keep mistakes from continuing to happen. So around and around she went, and took me on some confusing story about the use of satchels. Basically, NO ANSWER!
So here is a list of the social skills Supervisor Carrie Mannon displayed during our phone conversation on September 2, 2016:  argumentative, apathetic, unapologetic, condescending, and impatient. Carrie Mannon does NOT demonstrate the attributes of a USPS worker, let alone a supervisor!

I need to send a shout out to the new San Diego Postmaster Andre, the genius I met yesterday in his car while he was observing and following Raquel (Rockie), an OUTSTANDING CARRIER with nearly 30 years of mail carrier service, as if she were a rookie. Andre, the one who hired Carrie Mannon, had absolutely NO time for me to talk about Carrie Mannon while he was at a full stop, doing his observations. He chose to roll up his window in my face, mid-sentence, instead of listening to feedback regarding the Encinitas Garden View USPS facility supervision staff, specifically Carrie.
Great customer service, USPS. Way to go, Andre...you're as incompetent as your facility supervisor!< /review>

Incredibly rude, unhelpful, and uninformed.

Such a contrast from the Cardiff PO.

Another example of a failed government run enterprise< /review>

I wish there was an option for zero stars. I'm out of town, and with political mail, my mailbox is so full the person I asked to pick up the mail can't open it. I tried to call the post office, and after going through every option, I can't get a real person to ask them to unblock the mail box. Terrible that I can't talk to someone while out of town.<//Review>

<text>USPS is probably the biggest waste of tax payer money I've ever seen. I walked in the door and dropped off my package and was surprised four days later to see that my package still had not even been scanned. This is a shame for all of us tax paying residents to see so much money go to a lost cause. I will never ship through this branch again.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

< Review>
I have patronized many Chipotle Mexican Grill branches over the last few years at various States and have always received consistent good services from these branches. However, on both occasions that I have visited the branch located at 4180 N 1st St UNIT 60, San Jose, CA 95134, the services that I had received are so bad that I decided to write a review about this branch. On my first visit about 3 weeks ago while waiting in queue, after serving the person in front of me, the female server suddenly decided that she wanted to work on some phone order and thus I have to wait for 5 minutes while she was working on this phone order. Now, there were at least 3 - 4 servers at the counter working on phone orders etc. but somehow this server decided to stop serving me and join the other servers as well after she had served at least 3 queuing customers who are in front of me without having them to wait. Nevertheless, I waited patiently for about 4-5 mins while she completed the phone order and then switched back to taking my in-person order.

On my second visit which was today 04/21/21 at around 6:00 pm, there was no customer in this branch when I went in to place my in-person order. However, although one female server (she subsequently claimed that she is the manager and her name is Melissa) and two other male servers were present at the counter, the female manager just walked away after noticing me and one of the male server also started moving between the counter and the kitchen while not really doing any work but just refusing to serve me. Thus, I had to wait for a few minutes before the 3rd server who was busily preparing for a phone order to tell me that he will start taking my order soon. After waiting for a few more minutes with no server willing to take my order (the second server still pretended to act busy by checking on the food packed by the third server), I informed the third server that they are providing very poor service to me by refusing to take my order. As such, I demanded to talk to the manager. However, instead of the manager coming to listen to my complaint, she sent a third male server to try to pacify me. When I realized that this third male server was not the manager and demanded to talk to the manager, she then reluctantly appeared with a defiant and unpleasant look in her face. She also claimed that all of them are busily handling phone orders and thus none of them are able to serve the only customer (myself) in the branch and thus she does not think that it is an issue if I had to wait for almost 10 minutes without anyone taking my order. Upon asking her name, she also initially tried to evade this question by providing some nonsensical replies before she eventually provided her first name as Melissa. Thus, based on the two poor experiences that I have encountered in this particular Chipotle location at 4180 N 1st St UNIT 60, San Jose, CA 95134, I think that the top management should sent all the staff at this location (especially the manager Melissa) for retraining on providing good customer services as I have never encountered such poor services at other Chipotle branches located cross various States.<//Review>

I ate a veggie bowl everyday for a week and lost 10 pounds.  And never got tired of the wonderful flavors.  And had plenty of energy to go to the gym everyday.<//Text>

By far the worst value and customer service of a chipotle I have been to. Don’t have something on the menu if you don’t expect in store orders of it. Save your money and go somewhere else.< /Review>

They go 100% over the top for their Manager Serena to ensure all of the Teamwork that they put out is a hit out of the ball park for each and everyone of their customers every single day!!! I had to complete some work for this shop behind the scene’s so I seen how they work!!! The cleanest Restaurant in TOWN!!!
I wish I could give a hire rating but it ends at 5 stars.

Please enjoy their happy attitudes and their Delicious food!!! I know I did!!!

Thank you!!!

This place is disgusting, workers give you tiny portions and your meal will come with a side order of bugs<//text>

I've never been to a food establishment where they consistently give such little portion sizes. I've been to this location a few times.

When I said barbacoa, they literally took time to meticulously place two tiny slivers of meat on each of my bowls.

Btw there's supposed to be beans somewhere in there too.

If you see the Asian kid serving you just leave. He is basically giving you a $9 bowl of rice. (This was after telling him to add more beans and meat too). Go the Sajj instead. Its just across the parking lot and offers much more for your money.< /text>

< review>
Talk about mini-sized portions and almost a mischarge for veggie 3 pointer (they wanted to charge a full veggie burrito bowl for beans , rice and cheese!). The cashier gave an attitude about the charges after I pointed out it was wrong.  Cashier name is Dulce. Portions are stingy and pricing is going up, a combo for slow business, as there were hardly any customers in there. This Chipotle used to be better. Must be under ‘new’ management with the philosophy: give as little food as possible and charge as much as we can. Do not recommend at all. There 5 Guys and Panda right next door.</review>

Burrito was made twice, the ingredients were cold and if it were for the foil it would have fell apart. Terrible wrap job.

I have come to expect excellency from chipotle as they use the best of ingredients and are alittle more pricey than any burrito truck or local family own restaurant.</Review>

<Text>I ordered three barbacoa tacos, the young man dropped most of the meat on one and hardly any on the other two. I asked "can you even out the meat between them" and he says "oh, you want the same amount on each taco? It's kinda hard to pickup the barbacoa." Seriously dude??? It's just tacos. Come on now. 🤦🏾‍♂️< /Text>< pictures>

Great staff! Even though it wasn't busy, they hustled hard which was great because we had to get back to the convention center. Lots of parking. Healthier and way faster than busy Chick-fil-A. Thanks Chipotle!</Text>

<Review>This place lacks the energy that was once there. Maybe the crowd is too much, so the employees are tired. There was a time when folks at Chipotle suggested what goes well with what, and what to try. That's missing now. I will go back here for the food. It is tasty. But the energy is missing. Hope the mojo comes back soon.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<Review>Food here is typically not as fresh as other Chipotles. It seems to sit out too long, especially in the evening. The service is also exceptionally slow and there can be a long wait with very few customers.< /Review>< Pics>

The food and selection are pretty standard for a Chipotle. This is a good thing, as Chipotle typically has a simple selection of fresh, high-quality food. Although the lines can get backed-up during normal lunch and dinner rushes, the lines more pretty smoothly.  At these times, indoor seating can be an issue, but there are additional shaded seats outside.  I recommend the burrito bowl (about 50% more inside than a burrito itself).</review>

I wanted to give it a try and well, the beans and the ice were really good, but what really surprised me was the barbacoa, that tasted authentic, too bad their tacos are hard shelled because in a soft corn tortilla that barbacoa would taste delicious.
They are missing some lime and salsa to make it more authentic and tasty.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<review>No parking and long lines make visits during peak hours a challenge. If you can get in, this is a good location. They are very quick, compared to the Chipotle a few miles away. The chips and guacamole are always a must (and if you order only that, you don't have to wait in line).<//review><GmapID>0x808fc85332573239:0x66a37b7166deec5e< /GmapID>< time>

I'm not sure what the big fuss is over Chipotle. It's not good mexican food at all, more like a semi Mexican inspired wrap. How can you not have spanish rice for a burrito? The quality of the ingredients never tasted very fresh to me. Much better Mexican options in San Jose.< /Review>

Lunch rush can be a little daunting but I haven't seen them run out of ingredients which happens fairly often at our usual chipotle. The store is kept very clean. The staff is helpful but not so friendly that it'll halt the line.<//Review>

This location is close to several tech companies so it gest very crowded during lunch time. Parking is also a very big hassle in and around Noon. Apart from that, it is just another CMG with efficient service.</Review>

Good just like any Chipotle, very friendly staff

Only downside is consistency of the meat scoop size: some give you a giant scoop, some give you the smallest scoops ever< /Review>

Employees have never made a kids
Menu item. Couldn't read their own board. Overcharged for two mini quesadillas. Can't tell difference between salsa and pick de gallo. Average tacos and burritos. (Just hoping I don't get E. coli or whatever was killing folks in the Midwest.)</text>

Blah. You know what to expect from a Chipotle location, and this one is even worse than average. What a stinking disgrace for being in one of the most expensive metros in the USA. No more business from me, idiots.</text>
