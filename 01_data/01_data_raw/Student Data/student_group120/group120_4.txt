<resp>None<//resp><review>Just loved this place! I give them hands down 5 stars because that’s the what they gave me! Dr Young is so nice and patient and great at what she does! The girls In front that help with choosing the right frames are so sweet and really know their stuff!!! And on top of all that they actually sent me to have something double checked at Kaiser to make sure there wasn’t seriously wrong with my eye before giving me my RX! The office is really nice with all the fancy machines and scanners you could possibly imagine!!! All in all very impressed with everything!!!<//review></record></dataset><record>

<review>First the good: the business location is very neat and they have taken all the Covid precautions. The appointments are spaced out such that there is not a lot of crowd at the location.
The bad: There is a conscious effort to upsell at every instance. I understand that the doctors do not accept a cornea report from another location, but I was extremely upset when I was not given my prescription. I have been trying to ask for 2 weeks (via mail, phone and their online request form) to get my prescription. But its quite apparent that they block access to the patient's prescription because they want us to purchase glasses only from them.<//review><Rate>2< /Rate></record>

Both me and my husband have been patients here for 4 years and always had great experience. Dr. Young is the best! She does my exams every year and she is always sweet and attentive to details. She takes time to explain me everything and answers all my questions. Other staff members are great too! Also I’d like to note that the place itself looks nice and modern, all exam rooms look clean, pretty good selection of frames as well. And they take great precautions during the pandemic: they ask to sanitize your hands upon arrival, they let patients in and out from different doors to minimize unnecessary contact. All equipment is well sanitized before every use. Patients are allowed to try on different frames but frames are returned back only after being sanitized. Thank you for doing great job guys!< /review>

My family and I have been patients for well over 15 years when Dr Chatwani first purchased her practice in Newark. I was a patient of the former owner. She is amazing, she's engaging, extremely knowledgeable, and accommodating. Her practice utilizes the latest technology, and she takes the time to answer your questions and address any concerns. She takes the time to inquire about my kids. The office is very beautiful. Her selection of frames are awesome, I always get tons of compliments on my glasses. Her staff is truly a reflection of her.<//Text>

My wife and I visited the clinic for our annual eye check up and met Dr Young for the first time. We are very happy at the thoroughness of her exams, clear explanations in answering our questions and her professional courtesy! The clinic staff too were very nice and helpful (for patiently fixing my last year’s eyeglasses that broke during a fall).
I highly recommend Tri-City Optometry!< /Review>

<review>Giving it a one star for service. No doubt doctor is good. The frame we ordered for prescription glasses was replaced by another color. On calling they lied that they mentioned to me that it will be replaced once the required color will be available. They never called back. Apparently doctor suggested to avail the free sunglasses as per my insurance before the year ends. Price of sunglasses were unduly bloated . We did a mistake of using one complementary pair of sunglasses just before the end of the year thinking we can get prescription glasses , an extra pair, at the start of the next year. Now they say you cannot order another pair of prescription glasses by the end of this year. I expect the right Info to be given to customer and help them make right choices . They know better and first time customers might be amateur making right decisions.<//review><user_id>109823423787538701531<//user_id>< Pics>

I saw Dr. Young here who was very thorough in her exam and took the time to explain every step and things I should watch out for for my eye health.
And shoutout to Jody. I have been to a few different optometrists and have never gotten the kind of service Jodi provided. My prescription is ~very~ high which has made my search for glasses difficult. Jody gave me VIP treatment and patiently advised me on various frames to find and order my final frames.< /text>

I’ve been going to her for nearly 10 years!
She’s knowledgeable, kind, and always has the latest technology available.
Best of all, she doesn’t push you toward any products or services. Her staff is the same, very kind.
The new place she’s at (Mowry by Washington Hospital) is very inviting and relaxing at the same time.
I commute over 60 miles to visit her!</text>

Great Experience! Yesterday was my first time visit to Tri-City Optometry, very professional staff, explained from their end- what’s covered and what’s not covered by the insurance, what’s remaining and can be availed this year, guided through out the tests- what they are doing. Dr. Shital is awesome; very friendly, knowledgeable. I would recommend anyone and everyone to Tri-City Optometry.< /Review>

Long story short: come see Dr. Chatwani! Coming from someone who has been to 4 other Optometrists prior to her, she's the best! And I've been coming to her practice for 13+ years aka half my life! PLUS!! she's the Oakland Athletics Optometrists....what's NOT to like!?

I absolutely love coming to Tri-City Optometry! I have been coming to see Dr. Chatwani ever since she took over the business location from the previous Optometry that was in Newark....so about 13-14 years! I never miss a year without stopping by to get my vision checked by Dr. Chatwani and catching up. She knows my family and always remembers to ask about all of them. Last year, I changed vision insurance and sadly, it only covers getting my vision checked AT Kaiser. There is no one else I trust to get my vision right other than her! I decided to pay the exam fee out of pocket (thank you FSA! Its $150 btw) and  attend my yearly exam. Dr. C took the time to get my vision correct, there was a lot of back and forth trying to her my right eye with the best prescription possible. She doesn't like to double check - she triple checks! Thankfully, only my right eye was an issue and was the culprit for the sinus headaches and vision issues I was experiencing.

Afterward, you get to pick out glasses if you'd like - or you can bring a pair and just have the prescription updated. I picked out two pairs of glasses - a D&G and Ragbone pair - which I will post when I go pick them up. Also, if you have a Flexible Spending Account and have a balance remaining before the end of the year/spending year, they will cash out the FSA and give you a gift card to spend it on frames, sunglasses, etc.! It gives you another year to use and save it for what you'd like.

New location is amazing btw. If you went to the previous one in Newark, it was nice and cozy and felt like home - but now it's so open, and spacious...which means so many MORE frames to choose from!<//text>

<review>Dr Chatwani is an amazing optometrist!  She has the expertise and the knowledge to be a great doctor!. One of the area she specializes in is  scleral lenses for Keratoconus patients and we have had only good experiences as we go through this complicated process. Dr C is so thorough and takes the time to explain the most complicated issues in a very simple manner. She is friendly and compassionate and my children love coming here!  Her staff is super energetic and welcoming too and they always greet you with a smile. They go over and beyond what is expected to make sure you are taken care of. They are very easy to work with to coordinate appointment times, contact lens/glasses orders, insurance, and payments. As a physician ,I am impressed with the quality of care this clinic provides and always recommend it to my family and friends.<//review>< Pictures>

< Review>
This is such a fun and friendly place! I love visiting with Dr. Chatwani during my exams. They are all eager to help me pick out new frames and I truly enjoy the experience. Dr. Chatwani is very health oriented and gives me great advice about how to take the best care of my eyes. I trust her completely.<//Review>

Excellent selection of glasses and great customer care.  Teresa the eyeglass manager was very helpful

Dr. Young is an outstanding eye doc and was very thorough with the eye exam and also very kind and comforting

I highly recommend Tri City Optometry

<Gmap_id>0x8094a1251b89c141:0x39102c9e235dda08< /Gmap_id><Review>This site is my number one place.  Of all restaurants I know I favor it most. I never miss an opportunity to go to that place. when  I feel like having a special meal, this place comes straightaway to my head. best and many types of  food and a large list of dishes.great team, and great spirit. Not less important, the expence is reasonable. I suggest this spot with pleasure.</Review>< username>

<review>We were going to buy some liquid coffee creamer when we noticed that  the expiration date was a month and half past.  My husband informed several workers but no one seemed to care.

<Text>We love it here. All of my family calls on this donut shop. My mother loves the old fashioneds and I love any of their croissant sweets. Sadly, someone wrote that the doughnuts tasted funny. This shop is known for the freshness of their baked goods. I’ve yet to buy something that is anything but delicious. This place also serves great drip coffee!< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

The worker was very rude to me and my family, not giving us time to decide on which donuts we wanted. Despite them being open 24 hours I will make the extra 2 mile drive to a further donut shop.</Review>

<review>Sean was extremely efficient in setting everything up in an expedient manner,  as our heater went out after a forty year run. . We had a new heater system in working order and extremely professional & thorough clean up within a 24 hr turn around. (due to my husbands health issues.) We are also having central air put in within the next week. I can’t begin to express how wonderful this company is and Sean, Chris,  and Joaquin have all played a viable role in making this a successful & painless job.  They are all to be commended at Dynamic Air. Found them through Home Depot who we have used for over 30 years for  various home improvements. They are reliable and we have a no interest for a year payment plan. Thank you Dynamic Heating &  Air & Home Depot for this referral.  Job well done!!!

In additionally,  they returned on the day after the holiday and finished installing our new AC unit and new vents  as well   Ethan saw that everything was done to perfection with his supervision of the job & the clean. Up was immaculate  I would not hesitate highly recommending Dynamic Heat & air
Our heating & Air units come with a 10 yr warranty parts n labor as well. All that transpired was a very efficient & successful, professional & pleasant experience.  Thank you once again all who made this installation possible & painless. Our commendation.

<Text>I had several good experiences with Dynamic Air Services and definitely recommend you try this company for yourself - here are a few reasons why:

Most important, I discovered that all employees at Dynamic, from customer service on the phone, repair and estimate technicians, to the installers all were kind, professional, and informative before, during, and after every service and installation.

Several other companies made assumptions and bids without even inspecting the coil, condenser, or furnace. Just because something is old, doesn't mean it is broken and needs to be replaced. While Dynamic did comment that my HVAC system was more than 10 years old, they tested and diagnosed all parts then provided reasonable repair and replace estimates.

While I received several scared tactic estimates from other local and national firms, Dynamic was the only company to provide clear and concise information based upon facts with 1) documented proof and 2) independent verifiable information.

For example, on the repair side of the coin, I received multiple quotes stating my freon was low and needed to be filled or topped off with a cost ranging from $150 to $675. The Dynamic rep showed me the actual levels in my current unit, explained the min and max levels, and I was able to independently verify online prices as well as the pros and cons of "topping off" the levels. The freon levels were better than good and did not need any servicing.

I'm not a Subject Matter Expert (SME) in all things HVAC, therefore I need to trust the company I select. And while I could have used my current HVAC for another 5 or more years, I opted for a new Lennox system with a wifi thermostat.

P.S. the cat in the pic was purchased separately.<//Text>< UserId.>

I have had other AC maintenance companies in the past and have never felt confident that they were being honest. When Jeff arrived I knew this was going to be different. He was so complete and detailed with his work and explained everything as he went. He resolved an issue that I had had for years that others indicated was not even a problem. I would highly recommend this company and especially Jeff!<//review>

It cost us thousand of dollars to install.  The tech didn't do the install properly (used non-coated wires) which caused a short and blew out the transformer.  This cost us almost $500 to fix.  They keep giving us the run around and will not reimburse us for the issues caused from their poor install even though they say they will.  I don't like to take my issues online, but when you are being strung along sometimes you have to.  I highly suggest you look elsewhere.  There are plenty of companies that have integrity and this for one is not one of them.  BUYER BEWARE!</review>< Rate>

My family and I were long overdue for replacing our heating ,ac system and complete ducts and vents in our house. The initial consultation for service we had from  Eric the lead technician , and also the quality service  from the Dynamic staff was very good, efficient and honestly the best we could have asked for and received from them.</Text>

< Review>
Jeff did maintenance work on my furnace and AC today.  He did a great job and he was always informative with the input he gave me.  I was going to have my duct work done at a later date and I made a rash decision to schedule but  after thinking about it I decided this was not the right time to do this work.
He is very professional and very informative.  He is an excellent representative for Dynamic Air Services.
Thank you

<Date>1607192973989<//Date><Rate>1</Rate><review>The service schedule was done the same day which is a huge plus. The technician was very nice, professional and knowledgeable. He figured up the problem in couple minutes and detected the part he needed to be ordered. All good up to now. He charged $90 which is descent. The issue is the estimate for repair was $600 for replacing a $12 part that it’s replacement would take 5 minutes. This price gauging was not acceptable and I contacted them and he quoted me $375 per hour for labor which is insane. Be watchful if you have their service and count your fingers after the service.<//review>< pictures>

I had a new a/c and heating unit installed. Also have had duct cleaning, thermostats, and blue light air purifier. Al dehumidifier for the whole house. I have always had good service from dynamic air. Jose was great. Explained everything to me about the new system and was very neat.<//review>

<text>I was referred to Dynamic by Home Depot.  I had already received 5 other quotes and was hugely unimpressed by the other companies despite their good Yelp and Angie's list reviews.

Dynamic was fantastic from start to finish.  Their sales consultant, Sean was very knowledgeable, helpful and honest.   The  job's foreman, Jose was exceptional.  An excellent craftsman, skilled technician, extremely nice and helpful.  Always on time.

I am one of the toughest when it comes to contractors.  I am almost always disappointed.  This is one company which has exceeded my very high expectations.  This was a fairly big job.  I am thrilled with my new 2 zone, 3 ton/4 ton system with all new ducting and air purification.

I highly recommend this company.</text>< Pics>

mini split AC system not working and the temperature that day was at least 100 deg. I used Dynamic before to repair the same System and was very pleased with their service. Within just a few hours after my call Dynamic sent out Ethan to deal with the problem. He had the AC up and running in no time, my tenant and I were so happy. Great service, complete product knowledge and very competitive pricing. Dynamic is saved on my phone as the number 1 go to AC repair people.</Text>

Jeff was very professional and knowledgeable. He explained everything in terms we could understand and answered all of our questions without any pressure or rush. We were very impressed and will definitely continue to call Dynamic and specifically Jeff for all of our future HVAC needs. We would recommend him to anyone who is in need of this type of service.</text>

<rate>5<//rate><text>I called Dynamic for a "Tune Up" on the air conditioning / heat system.  Upon their inspection and tune up they noticed a problem with the motor in the fan coil, which was probably 20 years old.  The home is in Escrow and I needed to get this fixed or replaced immediately.  From the day they showed up for the tune up, to the day they completed the removal of the old system and the installation of the new system it took only two days.  The scope of work needed and the explanation of what was needed including the cost was very clear.  Outstanding Job!!<//text>< Pictures>

Jeff was great to work with.  He took the time to carefully diagnose the problem(s) in my system, and offered me choices for fixing or replacing my 20 year old unit.  I appreciate his honesty and clarity, explaining what needed to be done, and what I could expect from the repair.<//Text>

Ethan was a very knowledgeable young man, never tried to sell me on unneeded services. The price was reasonable & he even saved me money. I would definitely recommend Dynamic Air Services.
I called around 4:30pm & received same day service and it was a life saver, no cold air coming out and the temperature was in the 90's. I've got respiratory problems & my 92 year old mother wasn't dealing with the heat well. Thank You.< /Text>

I don't typically write reviews, but I wanted to share what a great experience I had working with Dynamic.  I had a VERY old air conditioning unit that got zero air upstairs.  I have a two story home and my biggest concern was spending a ton of money to get a new unit and not have it work in half of my house.  I met with 5 other local HVAC vendors before finally going with Dynamic.  I was about to spend 23k to put two units in my home just to make sure I got air every where.  Bill and the folks at Dynamic spent the most time addressing all of my questions, they were transparent with their pricing and capabilities, and lastly they had the best guarantees of all the other vendors.  They said there was no reason for me to get two units.  They put their money where their mouth is and they were right.  Everything has been working perfectly.  They came in and did all the work in two days.  They were professional, thorough, and clean with everything they did.  If you are in South Orange County, I would recommend them over all the vendors.< /text>

I had closed door on cord when changing filter, which caused a break on cord.
Ethan came out replaced cord and zip tied it so I can’t do that again!
I was pleased with the service provided.

Jeff was my technician.
He was very friendly and professional.
I have 3 dogs so put them in a different part of house.  They could see him but never barked at him, dog owners know this is a good sign.  Anyway, he explained everything he would fix along the way.  Very thorough.  Always wonder how high costs could go, so when the bill was explained I was very satisfied with the entire process.  All in all very happy.  Thx Jeff</review>

<Text>I called Dynamic due to my 16 year old noisy AC stopped working. I called three HVAC companies. Scott from Dynamic AC came out the same day, and spent the time to explain the features of available equipment and how Dynamic backs up their products. I was impressed with the knowledge and professionalism of Scott. We agreed on a new Lennox AC and furnace system. The crew led by Jose, was on time, removed the existing system and install the new equipment in the same day. Jose explained the thermostat operation, and all pertinent information on my new system. As I am a construction manage/inspector by career, I could not be more satisfied with Dynamic Air Services, and will highly recommend to all.< /Text>< time>

My central air heater had stopped working in my condo & I was miserably cold.  It was over the holidays so getting someone to come out to help me anytime soon was difficult.  I contacted Dynamic Air Services & I found the receptionist to be very friendly & concerned about my predicament.  She was able to schedule me for the next day (Christmas Eve morning) but kept a lookout for any opportunity to get me in earlier.   Kevin Colosky showed up on time the next morning along with his assistant.  When he walked in the door, he mentioned that my condo was colder than the temperature outside & then he assured me that he would fix the problem as quickly as possible.  He was very caring.  He discovered what the problem was & quickly fixed it.  I appreciated that he took the time to explain the problem & how he fixed it.  Before leaving, he asked me if there was anything else he could help me with.  He even took the time to inspect all of the air vents with me to determine if they were working properly & if I wanted to adjust them in any way.  I was extremely impressed with his friendliness & capabilities.< /text>

Ethan came to my home to solve a noise issue on the unit. Did that very quickly and also showed me the solution Incase it happens again. He then was very knowledgeable about the whole house UV light filter for my system and was able to install one on the spot. A very clean outstanding job. I highly recommend Dynamic Air as I own two homes and have installed new air/heating systems in both. Thank you Ethan for a wonderful job.</Review>

We are not very happy.
We were told that the Freon was low and so they did a leak test.
They apparently found the leak but could not fix it.
They then said that the Unit was out of Warranty and quoted us over $5,000 for a new unit which we cannot afford.
We have since found the original invoice and found out that the unit is less than ten years old and still within the Warranty Period.
We are not happy.

Excellent work.  Jeff is really good at his work.  Within minutes, he was able to investigate and discover my heating problem.  I was expecting the worst in terms of what I might have to spend, and he fixed my problem for under $200.  Very pleased.  I've saved his contact information for future business. Vince.</text>

<Review>If Service Technician Brandon is a reflection of what this company's service is all about don't hesitate to call them.
What can I say, determined & dedicated, honest, fair, and very patient and through. Thank you Brandon!
I have had bad luck contacting those online searches for heat pump repair. Last Friday I made an appointment with a well known company; Saturday between 2:00 and 4:00pm. THEY never even showed up or called.
Not so with Dynamic Air Services. I said we would be available after 2:00pm. Brandon was at our door at 2:00p.
I will not hesitate to recommend this company to my friends and acquaintances.
(A note to management: You have a winner here in Brandon. Don't let him go!)
It's nice to be warm again also.</Review><userid>109788429496473793931<//userid></record></dataset><record>

I originally posted two negative reviews Yelp which I have since amended because of today's performance by Dynamic.  Originally, there was a miscommunication regarding a problem with our system, the details of which I don't need to go into.  Subsequent to sending them a letter a week ago regarding our problem, we were contacted by Dynamic two days ago, and we scheduled for them to come out today, 1/17.  Bill and Dave arrived at 8 a.m. and worked on our system for over an hour.  Both were very polite, informative, and solicitous.  Because I, like most consumers, am profoundly ignorant of the inner workings of air conditioning systems, I've felt pretty helpless the past few months as I wrestled with different sources of information; however, Bill did a terrific job explaining how our system worked, what it needed, and how we should best operate it moving forward.  The best part of this experience was that Dynamic owned the miscommunication that had resulted in my two previously negative reviews . . . and that was all I was asking for.   As a retired high school English teacher, one of the things I'd always tried to teach my students, as a life skill, is that when you make a mistake, there is no better way to earn another person's respect than to simply own the mistake . . . in fact, that frequently shocks people because so many of us are accustomed receiving to weak rationalizations ("Hello, Houston Astros!").  Bill and Dave were professional and our system now functions properly.  Bill told me that they will also put together a pre- and post-inspection report, and all this at no cost to us!  It was truly a pleasure to have this concern taken off of our plate.  Well done, Dynamic Air Services!  :)<//Text>

Dynamic Air Services was able to schedule an appointment for me less than 48 hours after my service call.  I was impressed with their ability to get someone out so quickly.

Ethan C was the technician that came out.  He was early to the appointment, courteous, and extremely knowledgeable about our A/C unit.  He told me what he was doing and looking for after some initial questions. He had the unit up and running correctly very quickly and now, five days later, it is still running like a charm.

Dynamic Air Services prices are good and competitive within the market.  I would not hesitate to call on Dynamic Air Services again and would welcome Ethan C’s knowledgeable services again for our air conditioning needs.

Five stars for sure!

I just had Ethan diagnose the problem with my heater not working. He verified it was the thermostat. He quoted me $485 installed. I thought that sounded pricey but went ahead and okayed the work. After he left I found the same thermostat for less than $50 retail. I understand there's an installation cost but over $400 for 30 minutes work....
I had them come earlier in the year to do a service on my AC. That went fine at a reasonable cost . This one I'm not pleased with.< /review>

Kevin installed a new condenser and did some maintenance a year later.  He's a stellar tech is efficient and a master at his HVAC craft.   Friendly as well.</text>< pictures>

Kelly in the office was able to help schedule a service call before the chilly weekend and Brandon the technician was professional and thorough.  Upfront with pricing.

About 7 1/2 years ago, the team at Dynamic Air Services installed two new HVAC systems in our home.  The quality of the equipment, service, and technicians is outstanding!  They have worked with us as our needs have shifted and truly been a partner in our quality of life at home.  Most recently, in a regularly scheduled maintenance, we were discussing allergens and Ethan recommended an in-line UV light solution.  We are looking forward to cleaner air, fewer allergy pills, and fewer boxes of tissues around the house!  Thanks Ethan and Dynamic Air!!!</text>

<text>Great service and pricing from Dynamic Air Services. I had a fan motor go bad in my furnace and I called Dynamic Air and was assisted within a couple of hours as they promised. Brandon arrived on time and did a great job explaining the troubleshooting process he was going through. Can't say enough about Brandon's skills and communication during the whole process. If you are in the Orange County Ca. area and find yourself need AC or heating services I highly recommend calling Dynamic Air.</text><Rate>5< /Rate>< pics>

Ethan was punctual, called ahead of time, presented himself well, and understood what he had to do.  He found the gas just below pressure and explained what was involved and left it up to me to decide, without any pressure involved.  Looking forward to working with DAS for all future HVAC problems.<//Review>

<review>The details matter when buying something as expensive as a home HVAC system. Dynamic is a company that, over 3 years of doing business with them, seems to always sweat the details and get them right!

After interviewing over 10 HVAC companies, I selected Dynamic and I have been so happy I did! The owner Bill came out to do the initial scoping of the work and this is one area that made all the difference. The 9 other companies all said some variation of, "I've been doing this for years, you need a x-Ton AC Unit" without doing any heat load calculations. I asked them all, and all refused, except Bill. And after spending the hour doing them, he realized for my house the issue wasn't the AC compressor size, it was DUCTING. His quote came back in the middle of all the quotes, but included a lot of effort to get my ducting right (my house was built in 1968 and had no AC). Of course it came with a Honeywell smart thermostat. They also recommended a variable speed blower motor so that we could run the house fan at low speed 24/7 to keep upstairs and downstairs more balanced. The initial install took 2 days, but they came back on the 3rd to make it look perfect and to help eliminate noise from the condensation pump.

We did sign up for the 2x/year service (winter to check heater, summer to check AC) for the first 3 years which is key to getting the full 10 year warranty.

Now that we've had the system for 3+years, I'm SUPER HAPPY.  Kelly and the rest of the office staff have always been very professional. The technicians that have come to our home have always been polite, on time, professional and tidy. The most recent tech, Jeff, was **AMAZING** . He was actually able to work on the furnace / AC components in the utility closet that is connected to my baby's room, while the baby was sleeping, without waking him up!<//review>< Pics>

This is the second visit for our technician, Eric.  He's very friendly and pointed out to us that we've placed our filter upside down. We learned that our HVAC system is not good. Unfortunately we have few contracts already to fix our house like replacing windows, doors, installing plantation shutters, etc. we will need to delay on fixing our HVAC ducts but for sure when we're ready, we won't hesitant to ask them to replace them for us.<//Review>

Brandon (Bowen) was our technician and did an evaulation of our heating/air conditioning system, educated us on our current system and it's issues, and with our approval of associated costs, proceeded to fix all the issues.  All this was done at a reasonable cost and we were back in our cool, comfortable surroundings within 2 hours.  I had to laugh when I told Brandon he overwhelmed me with his brilliance as he explained the operation of an air conditioning system and he most definitely has a passion for his work.  BIG thanks to Angie's List and to Dynamic Air Services.  I'd recommend this company and especially Brandon to anyone in need of AC services.<//Text>

Story:
-In Home Depot -Was looking into ac tune up, scheduled appointment.
-Came did the tune up, compressor failed while working.
- escalated to supervisor and scheduled to come back second time.
- second visit they said your ac was old and was towards the end of its life and it was a coincidence that it died the same day if service.<//text>
<Response>{'time': 1572985741029, 'text': 'Hi Beshoy,\n\nYou asked us for a tune up because your AC wasn’t cooling properly. When our technician arrived your circuit breaker was tripped and you’re out door unit had no power, The compressor was dead making your cooling system dead. You also had several Band Aid repairs done to your AC that are also symptoms that your breaker has been tripping for some time before you asked us to come out. We even sent out our lead specialist to confirm the findings and make sure you understood what the first specialist told you.\n\nIf you read through our reviews, you will see we always take care of our customer even when we make mistakes. We always ensure our customers are satisfied with our work. You clearly knew your AC was broken and called us out just so you could say we broke it and fix it for free. When you threatened a bad review if we didn’t fix it, you made it clear that was your intention\n\nYou paid a $29 discounted diagnostic and because we didn’t fix it for free you left us a bad review\n\nGood Luck with your new AC\nBrian Christenson\nPresident'}</Response>< UserId.>

Dynamic Air Services recently replaced our air conditioning system in our home. We had utilized their services in the past for repairs to our old system and were always pleased with their response and knowledge. I highly recommend them to anyone in need of replacement and/or repair of their air conditioning system. The entire staff that was extremely professional and did a wonderful job for us. The job was completed on time and is working perfectly. Thank you so much Brian!</Text>

Eric was very professional, friendly, and very hard working.  He came back today to make sure all was okay with the refrigerant and to install another UV light.  Again, Eric was on time, worked very carefully with shoe protectors and floor protectors and showed me the numbers on the meter that indicate that the refrigerant was at the correct level.  He explained  the next steps, which will be the HERS tester and the inspector.  We really appreciate his work ethic, pleasant manner, and professionalism.< /review>

I called after my H W Companies Provider left me hanging for 3 weeks with no heat for my hydronic heater . After playing games with my H W C I calked for my own 2nd opinion and the wonderful girl on the phone scheduled an appt immediately for me . Jeff came out on the scheduled day at the time promised and ran into some complications with my pump case and another issue but he stayed ALL DAY , trying to get it fixed for me knowing how cold it’s been and how long I had been without heat . I am older and have a sick dog so he worked so hard for the entire day however he and Brian had to come back to Solder a part on a couple mornings later . All in all I have heat and I couldn’t be happier with the care Jeff and Brian gave me. If you have a hydronic heater you know not everyone can work on then . PS Jeff did try running saving me money by just running a line first so thank you Jeff for trying everything first !! Great Company and great two guys  . Thank you after One month to the day - Sadie and I have heat and we slept like babies last night!!<//Review>

<review>I found Dynamic through a neighbor and I couldn't be happier with their service. The company who installed our air conditioning unit and service closed. Although an older model, Jason Z knew the ins and outs of the unit and provided me with much needed information to properly use my unit. I found Jason very honest and extremely helpful. His work was seamless. I highly recommend Dynamic and have retained their business to perform my seasonal maintenance and checkups.</review>< date>

<review>Technician Jeff arrived at my house with a smile and eagerness to help. I was
recently told I had a hydronic AC system and that I would need a specialized company.

I was very naive with this type of system and Jeff walked me though the mechanics of what I was going to need. His company Dynamic Air Services and Jeff put my mind at ease that I even recommended Jeff's technician services to my neighbor who is also purchasing a unit as well. We are both exceptionally happy with Jeff's knowledge and kindness.

I would also like to give a shout out to Suzy who works in the office. I have only spoken to her on the phone, and she too has been very helpful and kind.

I would highly recommend this company to anyone needing "Dymanite" technicians, office staff and I'm sure Installers too.< /review><name>Catherine Ingle< /name>< GmapID>

About 3 weeks ago I called Dynamic Air for a quote. The reason I called this company is because they had recently been to my neighbors house and fixed their 25 year old unit for under 500 dollars and didnt put the HARD SELL for a new unit. Mine also being 25 years old I was hoping to have a similar problem. Brandon from Dynamic air checked out my unit and unfortunately for me it was going to be approx 1,500.
Brandon gave me the option of fixing but explained that something else might go wrong on the outdated unit after the fix which could be unrelated . I really was impressed on how Brandon took the time to explain everything to me .
I ended up getting a new unit that has been installed .The installers were also first rate .Adam Coutts and Dan Bloomfield were assigned to our job.It was the most amazing experience from start to finish.. ON TIME.
Can't say enough nice things about Adam and Dan.< /Text>

We were having issues with our HVAC System.  Called in on a Sunday for Monday service.  Worked through online system and received prompt service. They asked qualifying questions and then stated someone would be following up with me on Monday.  Monday 8:00 am received a  call asking if we still needed service and was given a time to be home. I got home about 45 minutes early and the Dynamic Air Services van was just pulling up.  OUTSTANDING!  The technician Ethan  was knowledgeable and friendly.  He quickly diagnosed the issue, and made the repairs.  He also ran a system check to ensure all was within factory specs.  He did an outstanding job at a reasonable price.  Thank god this happened before the heatwave this week.
Refreshing to have a service company show up on time, knowledgeable technicians, diagnose the issue within 20 minutes and have repairs made within the hour.  THANK YOU<//Review>

After looking at everything and determining that the compressor was shot, he explained how the parts to that system were being discontinued and gave me three options to proceed: fix the soon to be discontinued part, replace the outside A/C unit, or replace the entire HVAC system including the furnace, all of which had been "frankenstein-ed" together and wasn't truly up to code. Pricing was done that same day, and he dropped off a portable A/C unit the next day until they could get out for the system repairs. I didn't feel upsold, and a second quote from another company was very much in line with everything Jeff presented to me.

Update 8/21/2019: Two installation guys came by over two days to take out the old system and replace it with a new one (thanks Dan and Adam!). They were both on time and very helpful with my questions and walking me through the system after it was finished.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

AC was not working.  Dynamic Air Services was called only for this issue.  The outdoor condenser motor fan had cut through the electrical wires.  Simple repair for anyone in this business.  2 workers were sent out, and they recommended additional unnecessary parts for my parents' furnace (in the summer) and sold them a $225 "annual maintenance plan".  They replaced a perfectly fine furnace trap assembly and flood safety switch.  My parents were billed 6.23 hours total for both workers' time.  $797.56 total.  My parents are elderly and did not understand what was being sold to them.  They were very upset after this repair job, and let me (their son) know about it during my last visit (I live out of state).  I appealed to the company to refund the $225 in good faith but made no headway.  I did not ask for a return of the other charges, since the other work was already done, even though some of it was unnecessary.  So I'm forced to post this warning to anyone who might be calling this company.  The most bothersome issue is the overselling and unethical business practice of replacing parts that don't need replacing. If only the wires and capacitor for the A/C unit had been worked on, the charge would have been $214.11 + a $79 service call charge + tax.  So about $300 vs. $800.< /text>

<Response>{'time': 1544202400436, 'text': "Hi Mr. Lin\nKelly and I reviewed your case when you asked for a refund. I also have older parents and I can assure you know one took advantage of your parents. If you have read any of our reviews over the years you would see that. We repaired your parent'[Member Information Removed] AC over [Member Information Removed] months ago and you calling two weeks ago was the first time we have ever hear of an issue. When Dynamic repairs an air conditioning or heating system we look at everything and give our customers options on what they want to repair or not repair. We do this because all our repairs come with a two-year warranty and items declined for repair are not covered under the warranty. Being that your parents heating, and cooling system is over 30 years old we suggested a maintenance program that reduced the total price of the repairs below the price without the maintenance. We waived the diagnostic charge and performed the first maintenance that day. We also added a flood protection switch that they did not have. This will prevent the cooling system from flooding the house when the drain becomes clogged. Everything we promised to do was done and clearly communicated with everyone in the house.\n\nI'm glad to hear your parents 30+ year old system is still working. Most companies wont work on a system that old. They would just condemn it and say it needs to be replaced.\nHave a great rest of the year!\nBrian C.\nPresident"}</Response><gmapID>0x80dce9fbaa9cb09f:0xb1ce92705c52eb12</gmapID></record>

<Review>Great customer service so far, from the first call to Amy. She listened to me and was very nice and accommodating as far as getting me an appt right away. There was a fee for diagnosing, but she returned my call and the fee was waived due to being referred to them on the Nextdoor app. Brandon and Jeff were very timely, called to let me know they were on there way. They were both very professional and I felt like I was in good hands. Unfortunately as I pretty much knew my heating system was unrepairable. They explained everything and made me feel at ease as far as taking the next step. Will wait to continue with their proposals and if I choose them I feel comfortable knowing they will do a good job.</Review>< pics>

<Rating>3< /Rating><Text>Dynamic Air Services installed a completely new heating and A/C system in July of this year. 6 days ago in early November a racket like a machine gun began to come from the Lennox unit outside my home. I shut it off at once on a very cold day. This happened on a Friday evening. I was not able to get a response from Dynamic Air until the next morning. Kevin, the Dynamic Air serviceman identified that the fan blades were hitting the external ring inside of the unit. He repaired it by bowing the ring out and adding an additional screw. This is a brand new unit! It should not have malfunctioned in this way only 4 short months after installation. He did fix the problem but for how long?? Not good!!</Text>< pics>

Dybnamic serviced my aging air conditioner years ago and warned me it was getting a bit too dated to continue maintaining.  In the interem they replaced all the ducting which was not to code (builders fault) until the AC started faltering again since that meeting 3 years ago.  After a long discussion on options including removing parts for rebuild I went with a new heating/AC system and cannot be happier.  On a side note my old unit lasted 23 years.  They were professional, kind and explained all the work.< /review>

Don't waste your time with this place. Unless you're a big job or they're in need of work they will not service you. Totally pathetic.<//Review><user_name>Allan Gameros</user_name>< Resp>

<review>WOW, a GREAT decision to call Dynamic Air Services. Fantastic service from my initial communication through the evaluation and repair of my Hydronic Heater and thermostat.
Brandon and Dynamic Air will always be my 1st call in the future for any work needed on my Hydronic heating system. Thanks also for teaching me how to use the new Thermostat. Brandon is a fantastic teacher. we know truly understand what our system is, how to use it and maintain it.
Thank YOU Dynamic AIR!</review><pics>None</pics>< Rate>

These guy's are the best of the best. we installed 2 AC units and a Heating unit with them. Their [prices were in the middle of 5 bids I received but I am so happy we chose them, primarily because of the complete honesty of Bill K. when he met us. They flooded our house with workmen for 8-9 days to get the project completed. Their guy's were a total pleasure  to deal with, respectful of our needs, (including our dog) and worked so hard to get it done. We made changes and there was no problem for bill or the guy's to deal with it. The units work just great, could not be happier and they are instantaneously available  by either email or phone to answer my many questions. Use them you will not be unhappy.

It was our first time using Dynamic Air Services. We read great reviews on another review site.  Our air conditioning unit started a high pitched chirping sound yesterday. Although we could not replicate the problem today, Brian came out and examined the unit. He said that the fan is the only part that could be making noise like we described. He seemed to be a very honest and knowledgeable person. He did not try to sell or push anything on us. If the noise returns, we will definitely call him back to replace it. It was very refreshing to have a repairman give us honest advice and quick service. We will definitely use them again.< /Review>

Technician Erik Garrido was 100 percent professional and efficient in making major repairs and maintenance tasks on my sorely neglected furnace. Mr. Garrido was polite and personable in his conduct.  He displayed in-depth knowledge in his trade and the industry. He was patient, articulate and thorough in his explanations of what needed to be done to get the furnace working as it should.</review>

This was my first time using Dynamic Air Services after looking for a service provider on Angies List. I was very happy in how the service was completed and the technician was able to make the repair cheaper by not just replacing a part. I would use their service again in the future. The service was provided by Brandon Bowen.< /review>

<Text>When I first purchased my house, the air conditioning was not up to snuff, and this is when I first contacted Dynamic Air.  Bill came out and inspected my ancient system and determined that with a cracked furnace and deteriorating compressor, a new system was necessary.  They calculated out a high efficiency appropriately sized system for me, and the pricing was comparable to other bids I had received.  However, their warranty covering labor as well as parts for over a decade is what gave them the huge advantage.  The install was done in a day and they were tidy and respectful of my home.

I have continued to use them for two years for annual service to make sure system is operating perfectly, which it is, and they always show up on time and stand by their work.  I recommend them to all my friends.  Maybe never the cheapest, but definitely the highest value, and in the long run, the most cost effective.< /Text><Time>1478723213703</Time>< Pictures>

<date>1497822910574<//date><Rating>5<//Rating><Review>It was the beginning of a heat wave in June and our AC compressor wouldn’t start (humming sound). I called Dynamic on a Friday morning and they were able to schedule me the same day. Erik arrived exactly on time, quickly diagnose the problem and we were up and running in less than 30 minutes. Then he connected various sensors to the condenser unit and in the house and was able to accurately determine (confirmed by the software) that the unit was a little low on refrigerant. Erik explained everything in detail, made appropriate recommendations (never pushy) and let me decide what to do. Now my AC is repaired and I have confidence that it’s more reliable and operating at optimum efficiency. A detailed technical report with over two dozen parameters was also provided - very useful for future reference. From my research and past experience, their prices are more than reasonable.</Review>< pics>

Solid, reliable, up front, no corners cut.

The team provides an honest assessment of your situation, and lays out realistic options in terms of maintenance, upgrades, repairs, etc.

It is very clear to me that this team is in the business of long term relationships, and not out to squeeze their customers for a quick buck.<//text>

Dynamic Air came in a laser measured my whole two story 2500sqft house with vaulted ceilings throughout, then they did a blow test, and even injected some "smoke" to visualize the leakage of my ducting, which turned out to be in a very bad state... smoke going in the intake was coming out multiple ceiling light fixtures rather than the registers.  Loved how Dynamic Air used measurements and math to calculate exactly what my house needed and on the 112F day we had a couple weeks ago my 2.5 Ton (not a 5 Ton like everyone else said we needed) system worked great to keep the house a nice cool 75 inside.  They also fixed the ducting upstairs to get some more meaningful airflow into son's room.   Oh, Dynamic's quote was also the lowest compared to everyone else too.</Review>< Response>

<date>1541249914914< /date><rate>2</rate><Review>Sad to say I'm disappointed in the experience I had with Dynamic Air.  Having read the glowing reviews, I felt confident making a major investment in an HVAC system with them over other companies for their quality service.  Unfortunately, I ended up with a rookie work crew new to the company, who didn't apparently know how to install the system properly.  It took them two full days to complete the work, and then we had the HERS inspector come out.  He failed the install, and told us he was rather surprised as "that never happens with Dynamic."  We had to have them come out and fix the leaks they left.  So then we have the City come outr to sign off, and get the work failed yet again, for using the wrong sized parts and obstruction of access to the air filter. Yet another site visit, and more delay.  This turned into a week long ordeal.  I guess that's what happens when you get the rookies.  I'm disappointed.</Review>< Pics>

{'time': 1541704789835, 'text': 'Sorry to hear of your disappointment.  It was a pleasure accommodating you. Dynamic Air Services prides ourselves on top notch, professional service.  The installation team sent to you has 23-years combined experience.  It is true neither have been with Dynamic for their full career, however, they are very qualified and have exceeded our standards as installers.  Even with their extensive backgrounds, Dynamic Air Services always encourages and requires our crews to contact the appropriate team members with job updates or for clarification to job questions.  The full system replacement was scheduled for 2-full days and our team finished in exactly the estimated hours, even with assisting in repairs from a leaking water heater.  It was understood this job was under time constraints from the beginning.  We accommodated those needs.  The value of the HERS test by a third party is for the exact reasons of this job.  They did their due diligence and we repaired it.  Same with the city inspector, each city’s requirements can be interpreted accordingly.  We made our correction the same day and took care of the repair to the water heater on your behalf.   We were able to replace your complete HVAC system including HERS inspection and city permit signoff within a week.  We encourage your comments and feedback as we are always striving to stay on top in the industry.  We are pleased we could accommodate your job being completed, including inspections, within your time constraints and met your needs in the end.\n\nPlease share your feedback.

Excellent service!  I've learned I'm expecting too much from companies these days as far as competency, efficiency, and customer service.  Far too many times I am let down.  Not with Dynamic Air.  From the beginning of scheduling quotes to the home service to the over and beyond services for future maintenance- they have exceeded my high standards and expectation.  This company wants your business and they will treat you like gold to show their appreciation.

Our AC system died, but we wanted to try a quick fix or two to see if it could get us through the summer.  Dynamic Air provided us options and then when the quick fixes didn't work, they credited us the money we had spent on that work and put it toward our payment on the whole system overhaul (which was definitely needed for our 32 year old machine).  This is a company I trust.  It has integrity and honor.  I truly believe they put us before themselves.< /text>

Erik From Dynamic Air Services Inspected and repaired my A/C system.  He arrived on time.  He did a thorough inspection and made recommendations.  After removal and replacement of the old parts he pointed out the indicators of how the parts had failed.  He worked efficiently and did not try the hard sell of a new A/C system.  I recommend Dynamic Air Services.

I am continuing to have Erik at Dynamic Air Services maintain my HVAC system. I highly recommend their service.

UPDATE... I had a HVAC inspection /service done  by Kevin from Dynamic Air Services. I continue to be impressed by the quality of people they employ.  I will continue to use Dynamic for my HVAC maintenance and repair.</review>

Today all the heat records were broken by 10 degrees. Brandon showed up and has to be one of the most thourough technicians in any field that we have come in contact with. He explained everything he was doing and didn’t try to sell us things we didn’t need. I was a fireman in LA for 33 years and providing customer services is my biggest pet peeve, and Brandon provided that. Thanks Brandon.<//Review>

He even gave me options on what he thinks the best course of action for my AC unit would be .

<Review>This was my first experience with Dynamic Air Services and I am very impressed.  I first learned of the company from an article in the Orange County Register written by a manager there .  Since I was experiencing a problem with my furnace I called on a Monday and was able to have a technician come to my home on Tuesday. within 24 hours.  Erik Garrido was the technician that serviced my unit.  He was very polite, experienced and knew what he was talking about.  He knew exactly how my furnace should perform and was able to diagnose the problem and offer me additional suggestions to lengthen the life of my already aging furnace.  The company notified me in advance of who would be coming along with a photo and Erik also called me in advance of his arrival.  I would highly recommend this company for any heating or air conditioning issues.

We had Dynamic Air Services install and recondition our entire HVAC system. The old unit must have been over 20 years old. It was loud and did a poor job keeping the house cool on mildly warm days. This new MAYTAG unit that was installed can chill the house on days over 100+ degrees. They also fixed the duct work where it was needed and ran a new vent into our master bedroom. We can sleep upstairs now. We run a daycare from the home and have a few pets. Dynamic Air Services suggested that we install a GeneralAire air purifier. It works awesome! You wouldn't know that we have cats or babies in the house now. The MAYTAG unit is whisper quite and we can enjoy being outside when it is on. It is the best improvement I have done to this old house and I have Dynamic Air Services to thank for it. If we have a cold winter in California I will do another review about the heater. So far I have not run it other the when it was tested during the installation.<//text>

We had a bad thermostat. They came within 2 hours and were even early. They quickly diagnosed the problem. We had a faulty thermostat that a lot of neighbors had as well. I wanted to upgrade to the Ecobee thermostats but was always afraid to do it because we had two thermostats and it confused me. Fortunately Dynamic Air carries that product and wa sable to install two right away and get them working! Great service! Highly recommend.< /review>

<review>Truly incredible customer service acumen from the time I contacted Kelly on the telephone, through the twenty minutes it took for Eathen to arrive, and throughout the repair of our furnace. I do not know how she did but Kelly got someone over to our home in twenty minutes to check out our furnace.
The technician, Eathen C was professional, extremely knowledgeable, very bright and articulated concepts in a manner in which I am unaccustomed to seeing in today's world. The guy was great; diagnosed the problem, went out to get the necessary parts, and returned to install and test the furnace. Eathen looks like he is about 16 years old but appears to have major league experiencein the HVAC arena.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1513983601994, 'text': 'Thanks Keith\n\nEthan has been doing with me this since he was 16 and he has gotten pretty good, He was trained by the best!\n\nBrian C\nPresident'}<//resp><GmapID>0x80dce9fbaa9cb09f:0xb1ce92705c52eb12<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>we were out of town for the weekend and on our way home we turned on the AC from our phone App. My husband stated that he looked an hour later and the house hadn't cooled at all. It was very hot and humid, so we figured it would take a little while to cool down. once we got home we realized the although the air was blowing inside it was not cold. We started making callas to get someone out there, we quickly found out that the system was bad and would need replacement.

in our search we ran across Dynamic air services and with all their positive reviews we called them out for a quote. I have to say im very glad we did.....they made an unenjoyable experience painless.

We scheduled an appointment for a quote and John was a pleasure and quite helpful in working around our schedule. prior to our appointment we received updates to our email reminding us of our email as well as notifying us that our technician was on his way with a picture and the techs name.

Our technician was BIll.....I cant say enough good about him and how he explained everything in detail to us. We received 5 different bids to replace our system and pricing was all over the place. Bill took the time to explain what the requirements were by the state and city as well as what they were doing to guarantee the system will be installed to all requirements.....we noticed that the other quotes we received were very vague in regards to the process that is required and quite a few didn't even include permits or any guarantees that the system will pass inspection. WE felt very comfortable that Dynamicwas doing everything the correct way as well as not cutting any corners.

Once we made our decision, we called into the office and John once again was a pleasure to deal with. IT was then that we realized we couldn't get our installation done for about a week and we were in the middle of a heat wave. John let us know that Dynamic offers FREE loaner AC units.....we were blown away. No one offered anything like that. John set our appointment and later that day an employee from Dynamic air came over and set op our temporary AC, this made the wait till our installation much more tolerable.

On the day of the install, they showed up on time as promised and got right to work setting up for the install. It was surprising to see how much care they took in making sure that there was no damage to our home. They had tarps and floor protection laid down so that our carpet and flooring wasn't damaged. They worked very clean and careful. You could see that the team worked very efficiently and showed true pride in their work. As the project was nearing completion we noticed the same care that was shown in setting up the install was used in the clean up. they vacuumd and cleaned and once they were done t was like they were never there.

They spent the time to show us all of the features of the system and make sure that we didn't have any questions before they left. They also included one year of maintenance with the system at no additional charge.

I would highly recommend them for any work as they show a level of professionalism that just isn't common when it comes to contractors.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1553558534896, 'text': 'Thanks'}< /resp><gmapID>0x80dce9fbaa9cb09f:0xb1ce92705c52eb12< /gmapID></record>

< Review>
We heard about this place from people around Merced, so when we had the opportunity to try it while in Le grand we took it. It was damn good!!!! We went back twice in one day!!! Theres not much sitting area and they only take cash. The little liquor store next to them willet you get cash back, but she doesnt charge a flat rate. She charges a fee depending on how much you spend in her liquor store...pretty shady if you ask me. So take cash before you go. Le Grand doesnt have a Chase or BofA around.

You wont be disappointed with the tacos or burritos!!! They were amazing!!! The ladies cooking inside were very nice and friendly!!

Just know that Le Grand is FULL of gang members. Thankfully we didnt encounter any issues. In fact, the people we did encounter at the truck were all very nice people.  Still, tread carefully. Get your food and go.< /Review>

I said it before and I will say it again Marcos tacos has the best tacos in the state of California if you're looking for that Fresh Off The Border taste you know where the carne asada is spending on the little spindle and they slice it up with his sauteed grilled onions top with avocado what the side of zesty lime these tacos are so delicious make you want to slap your mama. But we are approaching and rainy season so please be aware that there are lots of flies on the outside but the truck is secure and clean.< /Review>

Two words... Super Bowl. Any meat of your choice served atop rice beans and lettuce and tomato, complemented by grilled onions and optional grilled jalapeno strips. Choose either corn or flour tortillas and go to town. Marcos nails it< /Text>

<Text>I’ve found lots of great tacos in California. These are the best.

When I first came to California I understood that carne asada was all the rage pretty much everywhere, but so often I found them lacking flavor and plain. Not here. This is how carne asada was meant to taste.< /Text><Time>1564775721398<//Time><rating>5</rating>< username>

<Text>This place and House of Hitz are owned by the same guys. They are the best spots in town to rehearse for your band in the Sacramento area. Very secure facilities with plenty of bathrooms, chill area's, and a good variety of rooms to fit your band. Jason and Reid are both really cool hit them up and get yourself a room!<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Gmap_id>0x809ac494e23d9fe7:0x34be67955f135621</Gmap_id>< response>

Quite honestly maybe in a rush to make my burrito but when I order a chicken burrito I expect it to be chicken in it I got a ton of rice and beans and lettuce I paid $8 for a bulldog burrito had to add a ton of salsa just to put flavor to it.  absolutely horrible never again will I but here first and last time<//Review>

< Review>
THE PRICE CHANGES EVERY TIME I GO IN
one day my bulldog burrito is 9.57$ other days its 11.50$
when I showed them my respites all they could say was I don't know how that happened. Then they left out sour cream and cheese outta my burrito and said sorry it wont happen again. NO FIX MY FOOD. they even made there salsa container smaller and charge the same for extra.
they are always upping the price and making the burritos smaller<//Review>

I really enjoy this restaurant. They have special burrito options for Fresno State students that includes a free soda and the burrito is awesome and not over priced at all. This is probably one of mynew favorite spots to eat between classes. It's definitely better than any of the food places that are on campus. Go there and ask for a Bulldog Burrito. The flavor is wonderful and the ingredients are fresh.</Review>

<Text>Out of all the Mexican food restaurants close to Fresno State, this one is easily the best. Fast service, good prices, food is bomb, interior is cute. Highly recommend their breakfast Burritos! They are the only breakfast burritos in town that I crave lol ♥️< /Text>< date>

My nephew told me about this place. He  said he liked their food because it is pretty authentic. I am in agreement, I've tried a couple of different items on the menu and I have not been disappointed. The staff is very nice but I'm here for the authentic Mexican food and I like it. Hand made corn and flour tortillas, fresh ingredients, I think I found my new favorite place to eat.</Review>

Just had to update, had two bad experiences here. First, I called in an order go pick it up. Pay for it, wait like 20 minutes, go ask to see if it's ready only for them to tell me they gave the order to someone else. The guy gives me a $5 coupon for the wait. Now, two months later I tried using the coupon only to be told it's a fake. Made me feel like I was being deceitful.<//review>

The staff is amazing, the prices are a bit on the high side considering my portions. I ordered 2 breakfast burritos and they were the smallest I've gotten anywhere, the taste was bland but the salsa was pretty good. The wait was also pretty long for no apparent reason. Again, the rating was pushed only by the friendliness of the staff, the rest was subpar</Text>

I expected to eat some great food here. Instead I was served a burrito that was very very greasy & sloppily made! The bacon was burnt completely black! The tortilla was stiff & hard to chew! I couldn't even finish it all the way! When I went to the front to complain about the bacon & what not, the lady told me to hold on but went to go hide in the back because she never came back out to answer my question! I left frustrated as I've already wasted enough time there. Later that day, I threw up the burrito I ate! This is the most horrible Mexican restaurant I ever ate at! I'm Mexican myself & was ashamed for this place! TO EVERYBODY LEAVING A GOOD REVIEW, YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T KNOW GOOD MEXICAN FOOD OR GOOD SERVICE!!??<//Text>

If you're looking for an authentic, friendly, and flavorful Start to your day - this is the place to begin. The Chimichanga is my new Favorite, and the Soft Tacos are always a for sure thing.<//review>

Homemade and authentic. Get a dozen tortillas to take home with your meal...they are amazing. Glad they opened up more seating! Busy at lunch so plan ahead. Breakfast burrito with medium salsa is a full morning meal. So good!</text>

I use to love going here all the time for the bulldog burrito. The person at the counter was always helpful and nice. Then I had a bad experience with a different front counter person she was rude about my order and not kind to explain the reasoning. So I didn't go back for a long while, about a week ago I went in for some breakfast burritos since I live so close I thought what the heck let's try them again cuz I only eat homemade tortillas. I thought the good counter person was gone but I saw them there such a great person, I would gladly come back if I see they're working the front counter. Food is good and when the service is awesome but three stars for that one rotten egg of a person.< /Text>

Good Mexican dishes, tacos, burritos, sopes and plenty more to choose from. They use home made flour tortillas which is a plus. Discounts provided to FSU students so bring your ID.<//Review>

<text>I start just about every Saturday and Sunday with a burrito from Tacos Marquitos. The breakfast burritos are priced to move and the fresh tortillas are amazing.

<review>Best breakfast burritos here in Fresno if you ask me. Home made flour tortilla with your choice of meats, eggs, cheese, and potatoes! It comes with retried beans but I ALWAYS get it WITHOUT beans. It's just way better wth out the beans. The green salsa tops it off being poured on every bite!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80945d10721c6013:0x1686b9463a642db6< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
The daily specials offer good quality and value, and the breakfast burritos are delicious! I especially love the hand made tortillas, and all of the salsas are on point and flavorful.< /Review>

1 star for the horchata... I ordered two breakfast burritos with Bacon and I paid extra for sausage and extra cheese. the bacon was BURNT!!! BLACK!!!!!! It made the burrito taste Horrible!! Complete waste of money, I asked the cashier if the bacon is always burnt like that and she just said "oh it is" and went to the back to tell the cook something but didn't bother answering my question! We gave it a try because of these "awesome 5 star rating reviews"  robertitos breakfast burritos are even better than this!!!! Don't bother wasting your money here</text>

Honestly Tacos Marquitos is not as "good" as people say it is. I ordered an Al pastor burrito that had only about 3 pieces of meat, the rest was all beans and rice. It had no lettuce, tomato, or cilantro, just plain as can be. To top things off, they were rude to me when I accidentally forgot my table number at the front. Horrible experience for first time dining.< /Review>

<Review>Sooo yummy I dont even know where to start, their tacos are sooo good and meaty not all cheaply made, if thats even a word, their breakfast burritos are soo good as well.  I guess the best compliment i can give is that it taste just like my moms cooking, this is REAL Mexicano food sooo delish :) And the prices are soo good. Ive had other dishes here and not one has not been good. Totally recommend this place if you are looking for authenticity here it is!!!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Definitely my new favorite coffee shop! Amazing customer service and such a gem in the middle of city heights. Coffee is nice and smooth rather than bitter like other places. And their backyard! OMG such nice vibes and the plants all over are so cute. This place is great.<//review>

Been wanting to visit this place before we moved out here and...we finally did today! Definitely gonna come back here and try out the other drinks and food items. My husband and I got some delish cold brews but the La Catrina (ice cream concha sandwich) stole our hearts! We got the horchata ice cream inside of a choco concha, with a choc and caramel drizzle and mazapan bits for topping. Always support local!< /Text>

I had a gift card for this place(Cafeinna). When i asked the young entrepreneur Andrew to check the balance on the gift card he was very professional about it. This place is very hip and cultural plus the coffee is awsome. Andrew is a City Heights local and i will definitely support this really cool place. No more star bucks for me! Check it out guaranteed you'll love CAFEINNA.<//review>

Looking for an iced drink that isn’t too sweet? I highly recommend the Horchata Cold Brew, perfect  amount of sweetness and coffee bitterness.

Parking might be hard to find but don’t let it discourage you from trying Cafeina Cafe.</Review>

Great coffee! Got the Cajeta Latte and spoke with the owner Andrew. Amazing, if you’re in town do stop by. Hopefully COVID passes soon so you can enjoy the lounge area with decorated walls!</Text>

The coffee is amazing. Great service. The parking is difficult as it is in City heights, but I'm happy it's in the community I work with. The Mazapan late is delicious.<//Review>

<name>Kim Ly</name>< Review>
Being born and raised in City heights I've seen so much good and bad changes to our neighborhood. Going to Cafeina and talking to the owner Andrew made me feel so proud to have someone who also was born and raised in the neighborhood making a positive impact to the heart of the city. Andrew's story about being formally in the medical field and now really pursuing his passion with his beautiful coffee shop was inspiring! The coffee shop wasn't just aesthetically pleasing but the coffee was amazing. Andrew nailed it with his recipes. I got the mazapan latte over iced with almond milk. It was perfect! Andrew even broke it down what he thought would be best in this drink for me. Great guy, great energy, super kind human and makes you feel so comfortable in his shop. I bought a shirt from the shop as well! I had to support plus the design was super cool! Told all my friends that grew up in that neighborhood to go check him out. We are all business professionals who love to drink coffee and take meetings at coffee shops. What better way to do it in a place where we once learned how to skateboard and ride a bike two blocks away! Thank you Andrew for being a positive influence to our community! Can't wait to come back this week!</Review>

Just discovered this gem. Stopped in and was greeted with a smile and pleasantly surprised to find they served James coffee. Met the owner, Andrew, and loved hearing more about the shop. Support your local business! Will definitely be coming back. Great coffee/atmosphere/service.</Review>

Delicious drinks and pandulce plus fun events like comedy shows and music! Worth the stop any day of the week. A super knowledgeable staff including the boss Andrew who could give you a detailed breakdown of any and all drinks served, they're all awesome though.< /review>

<review>Small business coffee and ice cream shop.  The ice cream is delicious and fresh, they have jamaica, horchata, mazapan, strawberry, and others. Perfect place to study or enjoy a coffe with friends. The coffee is cheaper and better than Starbucks. This is my new weekend coffee shop. Must try!< /review>< date>

The venue is spacious enough for pets to rest, and for little ones to vroom their cars along without bumping other customers. The space allows for a nice breeze for when it's hot outside, the bathroom is well maintained (smells good too)  and there is wifi.  Most importantly after a few other visits: the coffee is great.  You can enjoy the brews hot or iced, and they offer specialty   brews as well like Mazapan and Horchata Lattes.  If you want to add a snack to the mix, they also serve fresh pan dulce provided by local bakeries as well as natural organic ice cream for those who love it.  What really makes this place special to me is that there are non-dairy options as well.  The grand opening was July 20th, and I am glad to have experienced Cafeina Cafe!<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1565141665536, 'text': "Hey Candyce! Thanks for the great review!!!!

I worked w/Ellie initially via the chat function, who offered me a discount and helped to facilitate payment, which was super easy. In terms of the overall experience, I preferred picking up the phone and speaking with someone, as I felt the response time, information gathering and promised production deadlines via the chat/e-mail function post purchase were a little slow, which was frustrating and disappointing.

I was super fortunate that Susan answered the phone that day I called the store post purchase. She was AMAZING at helping me choose the right setting and with customizing it. She was super friendly, patient detailed orientated, professional and was always thinking two steps ahead. She always kept her word, whether that was to call/email me back or fill me in on something. The experience would not have been the same w/o Susan! She went above and beyond and so knowledgeable! She put my mind at ease.

Nan was also great in the payment process!

The turnaround time was great. Two weeks for custom made and shipping was super quick - 1 day FedEx and the box was nice and discreet!

The ring itself is GORGEOUS! The detail and high level quality is unmatched and I found the price for the diamond I got was a steal! Definitely would recommend YADAV to others!</Text><Resp>None< /Resp>< Rating>

My husband and I had an amazing experience online with Yadav! We actually found them through the New York Times recommendation for buying a whole sale diamond through rarecarat.com! We appreciated the discount if wiring the money. We bought a 1.01 carat diamond from Yadav for a custom setting we loved we found in New Haven, CT. The experience was so fast with great communication. The diamond was packaged beautifully, with the certification, and overnighted through FedEx without any trouble. Our jeweler in New Haven was shocked at the quality for the price and asked for me this shops info. For a young couple in our early 20’s, you guys gave us the best! 10/10 would recommend! Thanks again!!</Text>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>I was looking to replace my girlfriends Pandora promise ring and wanted a reliable small business to help me. I ended up ordering a 0.52 carat Diamond ring on a beautiful solitaire setting. At first I was reluctant to order from Yadav since I have never been there and I am no where near California to visit their showroom. After looking at their website and comparing them to other retailers, it was clear that they had the better deals for better diamonds. It was very easy to get in contact with their employee. The ring arrived only a week after I ordered it and 2 Day shipping once they ship it out. She loves the ring and I do not regret choosing Yadav over the other large companies that everyone knows about. I will definitely be coming back here if I need a diamond jeweler in the future!<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_n1XHECGVwkCVy8SNIoPjW-RI_FawOllIz8Yr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYtFnbWv9qUhITmziP3rQdd4zrXdJVhd9GCZDS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x808f7e2c76ec340f:0x828e09b5c38cbe2d<//gmapID></record>

<review>Vivian helped me select and finalize my purchase of an engagement ring a few months back. She was quick to answer, jump on the phone to answer questions, and provided authentic input. She made the process easy and I am confident I received a competitive price compared to other diamond retailers. I will definitely purchase more jewelry from Yadav again.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

Bought engagement ring and both wedding rings from Yadav; we could not be happier with the purchase. Quality of the rings is exceptional and the service excellent. Also, turnaround for resizing was fast. Will return for future purchases. One critique: email communication could be improved. I would suggest a trigger email notifying the customer of status of rings, etc post purchase, prior to delivery.</text>

Great website to find fine jewelry, easy to use and friendly. Didn't give it a full 5 stars because I purchased a set of diamonds that no longer were available and had to reduce the diamond quality for the same price for another pair. I'm still very happy and satisfied with my earrings after a lot of back and forth. My only feedback is to not sell what is not in stock!< /review>

But all the local brick and mortar jewelry stores were just outrageous in the prices they quoted me.  The entire process,  start to finish could not have gone any smoother- I spoke primarily with Ellie and she was so patient and calm with all my dozens of questions. I purchased my center stone first but wanted to see it in person to confirm it was a keeper. Then they paid for me to ship it back to them and we started the custom design process.  I gave them a LOT of clear cut details and images to go on, but the end product is literally flawless and EXACTLY what I envisioned. Every detail from the right "tone" of rose gold, (I like more pink and less coppery) to the size of all the acccessory stones, to the "low profile" basket setting which was very important to me.  End result = 1.75 carat center oval stone (E color, VS1 clarity) set very low on a basket setting with a 1/2 pave band (2 mm wide) and a dainty hidden halo. Wedding band is 6 bezel set diamonds (0.5 carat total weight) on a 3mm rose gold band. Because the main ring is set so low, the wedding band cannot sit flush against it so they designed it in an "interrupted " fashion, meaning there is actually a gap in the wedding band to give it the illusion of sitting flush. I chose to solder the 2 rings together for this reason, so the wedding band would not spin and show the gap. It's like they read my mind and the best part is I expressed wanting it done in time for a trip to Turks and Caicos and they somehow managed to build this ring from scratch and have it in my hands in 7 days flat! It is stunning and I am so happy with it, 10/10 for Yadav!</Review><gmap_id>0x808f7e2c76ec340f:0x828e09b5c38cbe2d</gmap_id>< response>

My fiance and I had the best experience shopping at YADAV, and we were all the way on the east coast! Maytal was very patient and accommodating as we custom designed my ring. She made my ring a priority and we recieved it in record time! I would advise anyone who enjoys great customer service with a family vibe, to shop at Yadav! Not to mention this jaw dropping beautiful ring that we received!!< /text>

Yadav was excellent! I bought the perfect engagement ring and she loved it! Yadav had a great selection of both natural and lab diamonds and many settings that were much classier than what some other online vendors had on their websites and more in line with my now fiancée's tastes. They also let you do 3/4 sizes for the rings while other jewelers only did increments of 1/2. I had a great experience working with the Yadav customer service team and they were able to price match a diamond that was also being listed on a competitor's site. I had a great experience and would recommend them to anyone!< /review>

The ring and diamond came out beautifully!  My girlfriend (now fiancé) loves it! I worked with a gemologist over the phone named Sheila, and she was very helpful in guiding me to the right ring.< /text>

I was a little apprehensive to buy a diamond without seeing it in person. Yadav had a clear return policy, so I took a chance. Communication and reassurance from them was great. When I received the stone, I was astonished! It was a gorgeous, brilliant, sparkly diamond, much better than I expected. Besides the quality, the price was amazing. I would definitely trust them.
Thanks, Yadav!< /text>

Yadav is full of friendly, focused associates who ensure your satisfaction.  I had the diamond inspected at Diamonds Direct, who verified that the inscription matched the GIA certificate.  The diamond is beautiful - see for yourself.  And the setting and craftsmanship are top notch as well.

I HIGHLY recommend this jeweler for engagement rings.  I will be using them for my Wedding bands as well.  I hope to one day be able to visit the team in person.</Text>< UserId.>

Product was great.   Felt like I had to keep on top of the process and “remind” them of my order.  Communication was great- just wish I hadn’t needed to contact them so much in the first place.  Good value, as described.</Review>

Regarding my online experience:
They were very helpful in the first half of my ring buying experience, answering my questions about the ring and diamonds quickly and in detail.
After purchasing the ring, the person I was communicating with was not helpful when trying to work out the details of the delivery. They will only deliver to the billing address of your credit card, and require a signature at delivery, which was very difficult because I wasn't working from home and my fiance-to-be was.
The ring itself was almost flawless. They center setting is a bit crooked, only noticeable because there is a tiny gap between the setting next to it on one side, but not on the other.
My fiance contacted them about her wedding band, but they didn't get back to her. When I reached out about getting a wedding band they did get back to me, but I wasn't happy with the experience.</review>

Recently purchased a diamond from Yadav online and the entire process went by so smoothly. I couldn't believe how easy it was to buy a ring online with them. Very friendly, responsive customer service team, great communication. Some rings even qualify for 2-day shipping!

On top of everything, we were so thrilled with the quality of the diamond. We took the diamond to our original jeweler and he was even saying how great the diamond looked.

I could not recommend Yadav enough!</review>

<Response>None<//Response><Text>I purchased a diamond from Yadav in December and had them set it in a simple platinum band.  First, the diamond is absolutely gorgeous.  I was hesitant to purchase a diamond without seeing it first, but they sent me videos and extra pictures that I requested.  The information they had on the website was spot on.  Second, the craftsmanship of setting the diamond in the band is pristine.  It is a beautiful piece of jewelry.  Third, when I purchased the diamond, I wanted to put it on multiple credit cards.  When I processed the order online, an associate with Yadav called me within just a couple minutes to take my credit card information.  It was seamless and painless.   Lastly, Yadav kept me updated on the status of the ring after I purchased it.  It took them a couple days to set the stone in the band, then they sent it to me overnight mail.  I can't recommend Yadav enough.  The ring is beautiful; my new fiancee loves it; this experience has been amazing.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

My search for the perfect engagement ring to propose to my girlfriend led me to Yadav Diamonds. They have a great selection of high quality diamonds and customizable very chic settings. I requested few changes on the ring I picked and they made it exactly as I imagined. Their price is unbeatable. Customer service is great and always reply on time. 10/10 experience without any hassles.< /Review>

I am absolutely thrilled with my engagement ring. I chose a setting that was perfect for me. They had many styles to choose from. Upon analyzing different choices of diamonds, I chose a stunning cut. Yadav put it all together resulting in a gorgeous ring. I live out of state so I had to take a chance and ordered it online. I couldn't be happier!</Text>

<Text>Yadav was the perfect place to buy my engagement ring. I spent many months researching, and with Covid I decided to go with Yadav while living on the opposite coast because of other good reviews and because they had the lowest cost and nicest ring design. The agents were very helpful, I reached out repeatedly for help and they gave me honest opinions on diamonds. They offered a great price, kept me updated with the shipping process and had great communication. I would strongly suggest Yadav to anyone-I trust them and even though I am thousands of miles away I won't go anywhere else.< /Text>< name>

I spent an enormous amount of time searching the internet for the perfect engagement ring for my fiancée. Yadav was the only jeweler that had the setting I wanted, with the perfect stone, at a great price. I was thrilled with the customer service I received. The whole process was so easy. When I received the finished ring I was blown away. My lady was amazed that such a beautiful ring was to be hers.
I catch her looking at it all of the time. When we had it appraised for insurance purposes I pleased that the appraisal was considerably higher than the purchase price. I would not hesitate to recommend Yadav to anyone in the market for the perfect ring for their special someone.  I am a very satisfied customer.< /Review>

Yadav was great to work with. Amazing email communication throughout the process. I wanted something custom and they delivered!  They shared CAD designs and a week after I approved, they built a beautiful ring at a great price.  I did have to have it resized (solely my fault), and they happily did so in a couple days.< /review>

We got my 2ct solitaire diamond ring last year from Yadav, and of course I was nervous as they are in California, and I am in Idaho! I am so glad we did! Its been a year already and we have their yearly extended plan. It was such a easy process-mailed it Fed Ex, paid by Yadav and a week later I got it back and it looked as the day I got it! It is the most beautiful ring and the sparkle was out of this world. I put 2 diamond bands with my solitaire that I bought from Costco and they checked those diamonds and made them sparkle as well. The best customer service in all the land. I highly recommend them! I get complements all the time on how beautiful my ring is.</Review>

Our experience with Yadav Diamonds and Jewelry has been wonderful! My fiancé surprised me with a personalized trinity engagement ring from Yadav. I was very pleased with his choice! Therefore, I also decided to purchase his wedding band from Yadav! We are both very happy with our rings and look forward to getting married at the end of this year!<//Review>

Easy to find diamonds that “fill the bill”, as far as the 4 C’s  (cut, color, clarity and carat!) go. I was able to purchase diamonds to set at my own jeweler. I feel confident knowing what I purchased. And they are lovely! I would use this company again. Thanks!<//Review>

<Text>Yadav was incredible from start to finish when I worked with them to custom design my fiancée's engagement ring. They were highly responsive and friendly throughout the entire process, and always answered my questions thoroughly before proceeding to the next stage. The ring design I was going for was totally unique from any of the settings they had on their website, so naturally, I was a little concerned if Yadav could actually achieve the exact design I had in mind (since they'd have to build it from scratch). But let me tell you, they nailed the design PERFECTLY and it even ended up looking better in person than I imagined! I was blown away by the ring's beauty, and so was my fiancée! I would highly recommend Yadav to anyone, especially if you are looking for friendly, honest, and knowledgeable experts to help you create a totally unique ring.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

My husband and I got our engagement/wedding rings from Yadav and had a wonderful experience with them. He raved about the excellent customer service helping him navigate buying my engagement ring and they gave us a discount coming back to buy our wedding bands. Really great and highly recommend.

Never expected to buy an engagement ring online but COVID made it hard to sneak around to local jewelers. I ended up really happy with the process and the diamond I found. Fast responses and straightforward process, which made it as comfortable as possible given the incredible stress of making the single greatest cash purchase of my life online.. If you found a perfect diamond at Yadav and you’re just doing due diligence, just pull the trigger</Text>

<Name>Rob Frazzetta</Name><Review>Customer service was excellent. Ellie was the best....My wedding ring was stolen when I was traveling for work. I was so upset this happened. I explained to Ellie exactly what I wanted in detail. My mission was to find the same exact ring. When I explained everything to Ellie....They made my ring exactly the way I had it....if not better. The first time they sent the completed ring was a little big....with no questions asked they took the ring back  and made another one that fit exactly to my ring finger. I can’t explain how how i happy they made me. I definitely recommend this place.....it feels like my wedding ring was never stolen.

Bought an engagement ring from them.They were fantastic. So helpful from the beginning questions to the final part of being the ring sized and then resized. Went and got a personal appraisal done to make sure what i paid for was what i received. Appraisal was 100% accurate with what i received. I would highly recommend them and will be going to them for the wedding bands as well.< /text>

<text>I had a really great experience purchasing from Yadav. Living in Colorado, I never had the chance to see any of the ring options in person before purchasing online, so I felt like I was taking a little bit of a leap of faith. That said, they had great product content and details on their website, and their online chat tool was a lifesaver, as the employees on the other end were extremely knowledgable and helpful (and not sales pushy). Between the chat assistance and Yadav's customer-friendly online purchasing policies (e.g., free insured domestic shipping, 30-day satisfaction guarantee, an affordable appraisal add-on option at check-out) I felt confident making such an expensive online purchase decision. Most importantly, the ring itself lived up perfectly to expectations, and my fiance was thrilled! I would definitely recommend Yadav to others, and would absolutely consider them again for future purchases (just not an engagement ring...I only plan on buying one of those).< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x808f7e2c76ec340f:0x828e09b5c38cbe2d</gmap_id></record>

As a first time diamond buyer I did a lot of online research to find the perfect diamond. All of my online searches led to Yadav, and I'm glad they did. I went to Yadav twice -- once to see some diamonds and rings in person and to learn more, and the other time to make the purchase. Both times Maytal helped me and she was super helpful and patient with me, which I greatly appreciated as I'm sure I was asking really basic questions. Very happy with my purchase and the service that I received, will definitely return to Yadav for any future jewelry purchases!</review>

< Review>
I ordered a diamond ring that I was told would be shipped 2 weeks later. After waiting I got the ring, but I received the wrong setting. I called them up and they apologized and I sent it back. After another 2 weeks, I got the ring I wanted and all was good. It's very nice and well worth it.<//Review>

<review>More than 3,000 miles away I was a little reluctant to make such a large purchase, but I did my research and decided to trust Yadav Diamonds & Jewelry with one of the most precious moments in my life. Let's just say I'm glad I did, they delivered BIG TIME, every step of the way. I got the VIP treatment from both Maytal and Sheila. They are very knowledgeable and took care of me from beginning to end. They worked with me to customize the ring to flawless specification. The ring turned out absolutely stunning.  My fiance'e loves it and constantly gets compliments. And the best part to me....  Along the way, something didn't quite go to plan that could have ruined our whole experience. At first I was definitely on edge especially being so far away, but let me just say that the entire team at Yadav made me feel comfortable, assured me that everything was going to be alright,  they totally owned the mistake which is rare in business today. Mr. Yadav, called me to extend his apologies, took full responsibility for the mistake and went above and beyond to make it right. The ring is absolutely stunning, and I got it at a tremendous value compared to local jewelers. That being said, the reason  I'll be customer for life is because I found someone I can trust who truly values their customers.  Not often today do you get the total package, Yadav Diamonds & Jewelry is the Total Package.

I can't say how much I was impressed with the customer service from Yadav. I had ordered 5 diamonds to be channel set in a custom gentleman's band. Less than two weeks after the approval of the CAD renderings the ring arrived. Absolutely flawless craftsmanship. I could have not been more pleased. Ellie guided the whole process beautifully. I have worked with a local jeweler for over 40 yrs and asked him for a quote.  I provided the GIA numbers for the diamonds to be fair.  His quote was almost $3000 more than Yadav using the same stones and identical custom mounting. I was initially apprehensive about ordering something of this price thru email communication. My concerns were unfounded after receiving the finished product. I would HIGHLY recommend Yadav to anyone looking to purchase custom jewelry.. Excellent customer service and unbelievable craftsmanship. My experience says you won't be disappointed!<//text>

<time>1616965178436< /time><Rating>5< /Rating><Review>I bought my now fiance's engagement ring at the beginning of the year.

I found the Yadav site easy to use. The price was excellent. The service (mostly via email, plus one phone call) has been excellent as well.

After selecting the stone and ring combo, there was a notice on the site letting me know that it would take a few extra days since the stone had to be mounted. It took about 10 days to arrive, which seemed fairly quick to me.

I had to send the ring back to take it down a half a size. That process was pretty seamless and they paid for the shipping.

As far as the ring is concerned, my fiance LOVES it. She has received more compliments on it than I can count. I'm not much for jewelry myself, but I find myself staring at the stone. It's mesmerizing.

Overall, I think this purchase went as well as it could have. I don't regret not buying the ring locally. I got a great deal and there were no hiccups.

I 100% recommend this company.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

I had an amazing experience with Yadav! They helped me narrow down my top 4 choices for the center stone and explained specifics beyond the normal criteria to look into. Shipping was fast, and the packaging was super secure. All paperwork included and they followed up to ensure everything went as planned. Most importantly, she said yes!<//Review>

Sheila, my point of contact during the design process, was nothing short of amazing. She was super responsive and attentive to all my questions, concerns, and design edits and was really invested in helping to make my design come to life. It was clear that she was so excited for my now fiancé and I, and it felt like I was truly working with a friend. The craftsmanship is immaculate and I have been showered with compliments on my unique ring. We will surely be going back to Yadav for our wedding bands as well.

The team at Yadav made the process very easy working over the internet and phone. Over a 6 month period I think I connected with them in person, via chat and on the phone (went in person pre-pandemic and then everything else remotely from east coast).

Everything worked out perfectly and the ring is amazing. 3 carat oval cut with pave setting. Fiancé can't stop staring at it and everyone loves it.

Thank you Yadav!!!!</text>

The diamond, a 2.18 carat, nearly perfect stone, arrived fairly quickly.  It is absolutely beautiful.  Even the jeweler was impressed.  The only problem we had was that the paperwork, about the diamond, took an extra month to arrive.  My wife loves her new ring.</Review>

I did a lot of research before settling on making my purchase through Yadav and I am so happy that I did. The pre-sales service was exceptional and everything worked out perfectly.

I can be a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to large purchases. The staff at Yadav has been outstanding in dealing with me. They were prompt in their responses and providing all the education and information I needed to select the best diamond available. They actually found one that was a better quality than what I had originally selected, but at the same price range. I would highly recommend Yadav!</Text>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>What a great experience. I was looking for an engagement ring, and went to all the local big name stores, but wanted something specific so I reached out to Yadav. Every single person I spoke with was very helpful and knowledgeable. I was skeptical buying from a jeweler in a different state I had not heard of (especially with an expensive engagement ring), but I felt comfortable after speaking with them. I got to pick my own stones, and they custom designed the band for me. When I got the ring, all the diamonds had more “fire” than any ring I saw in the store. My fiancé was so happy with the ring. When other people see it, they always comment on how much it sparkles. Also, Yadav had one of the best prices I could find. Make sure you consider Yadav for your jewelry, you will be happy you did.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOf2tekA6_BrVYjLIbf7Iknn5uc2OUm7faaTQu9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< resp>

Yadav is the most impressive jeweler I've come across. Their online presence is incredible, which is how I purchased an engagement ring for my fiance. I found the diamond on RareCarat.com, and it was the most incredible diamond I've ever seen! Yadav's craftsmanship of their rings is second to none. The quality of the engagement ring I purchased was breathtaking.< /review>

Working with Yadav has been an absolutely awesome experience! I went to a few other jewelers and felt like I was just a number trying to be sold something I didn’t want. At Yadav, they truly care about their customers and the quality you pay for is what you get. Edan was truly awesome and worked with us for months to find that perfect stone I had been looking for. They also have the best pricing that no one else can compare to or even come close! Yadav has made me a customer for life that I would recommend to anyone looking at engagement rings or fine Jewlery no matter where you are! Much love from Texas!</review>

Impressive business model. The ability to select the diamond by filters is common place in the world of online diamond sales but their ability to custom make the setting is second to none. They actually do 3D renderings prior to order confirmation. I would have never been able to get the diamond and setting that would made her happy locally where I live central ny. If you’re skeptical about buying something like this online (I sure was) you won’t regret it. Worried about Shipping? Oh ya they sent it from San Francisco to me in less than 18 hours. I’m picky and they were patient enough to deal with my never ending email chain of questions and requests. They also shockingly did not get upset after I told them I would need to wait 8-9 months until I ordered. I simply emailed the original associate again later that year and we picked up where we left off. I did a lot of research comparing Diamond prices online with AI driven comparison sites and consistently their prices are the best bang for your buck if that’s all you’re worried about. The setting was also not expensive (relatively speaking) for a custom one made of platinum. Why did I leave a review? Simply put I want a free ring cleaning kit because I’m cheap. If that tells you anything about the cost to value ratio they provide on the ring itself....it should.<//Text>

I am very satisfied with my beautiful diamond from Yadav.  The price was significantly lower than comparable diamonds from other stores. I had mine shipped to me and was also very impressed and satisfied with the level of care that went into the packaging. Would highly recommend this experience to all other buyers</Text>

My husband bought me an engagement ring from Yadav after the ring I had from another company broke. Yadav was more than helpful in helping us pick out the perfect ring. We live in Georgia so we were unable to see the ring in person but Yadav made sure we were more than happy with what we were purchasing. They were very responsive and helpful throughout the entire process. I am so happy with my ring and would recommend Yadav to anyone!</review>

Yadav Jewlers was a wonderful experience!

I was hesitant at first ordering online in general, not being able to see anything in person, especially on such a higher value investment such as a diamond ring......I decided on Yadav based on customer reviews, their competitive pricing, and of course their money back guarantee policy.... I had ordered an emerald cut for my fiancé’s engagement ring, with a simple solitaire gold band.... I had done plenty of research, so I knew exactly what I did and didn’t want as far as the specs of the diamond go.... I have to say, the ring was absolutely perfect. I couldn’t have been more pleased. I chose to have it appraised at a local appraiser, and I was pleased with the appraised value, so fear not when it comes to getting a great value!.....On top that, the customer service, response time, and sensitivity to time and attention to personal needs were anything but sub par. Needless to say, I was very pleased.....If I had to start the process all over again, or recommend Yadav Jewlers to anyone, I wouldn’t hesitate for a second! All around 5 stars!

Yadav was the absolute best place to purchase a diamond from. The customer service was second to none. I received the diamond and all supporting documentation in a nice package within days of placing the order. I recommend Yadav to all of my family and friends. I could not have asked for a better experience.<//Text>

I am very satisfied with the ring that I got from Yadav. With the company listing all the majority of its stones online, I were able to pick out the stone I loved the most. Walking to their physical showroom, I got the chance to meet with the staffs and see how certain diamonds actually looked like in reality. The customer service was also the strong point of this particular jeweler due to the staffs' friendliness and helpfulness during the ordering and delivering process. Both me and my fiancé will definitely refer Yadav to our friends and family in the future for sure!</review>

Very pleasant experience. Their diamonds have the right price and great quality. Staff is very helpful. Responded very quickly. We brought the  t they make the ring online but they made our experience very pleasant. They sent us photos of real diamond before we placed the order. Came in time.</review>

I had such a wonderful experience working with Yadav from start to finish.  I worked with Vivian who helped me every step of the process.  Yadav was able to customize the engagement ring exactly how I wanted it, and the shipping was faster than any of their competitors.  I would (and have) highly recommended Yadav to friends and family.< /text>

<Text>Absolutely 5 star experience.  I spent a lot of time researching various online jewelers and decided to go with Yadav.  Buying something online for $10K+ without physically seeing the product is a bit of a nerving experience.  Yadav hit all the marks to alleviate my concerns (as best as possible).  Great website with lots of pics, outstanding prices, quick replies to emails, and they answered the phone the few times I called and provided excellent customer service.  The product was received on time and was even more impressive than expected.  I highly recommend Yadav.< /Text>< pictures>

Recently proposed in NYC to my fiancé.  Spent time on several diamond websites looking for the right combination of quality of diamond and workmanship, website easy of use and customer service.  I landed with Yadav and it was an excellent decision.  Once I selected the ring and setting, customer service was immediately there to guide me through the process and offer support when needed.  Communication was excellent once we finished the details of the ring, the construction of the ring and the delivery.  My fiancé loved the ring is really an understatement.  I would highly recommend Yadav for your next jewelry purchase.

Thanks

There are plenty of jewelers out there and specifically in the jewelry mart, but I ultimately went with Yadav due to other positive reviews, fair prices, selection, and flexible policies. I couldn't be happier with my decision and experience. I worked specifically with Kyle, and Maytal/Jim - everyone was very kind, courteous and was able to give me clear answers to my questions. The engagement ring, diamond came out beautiful and look forward to doing business with them again for future jewelry needs.<//text>< Time>

<Text>I am sooo happy with my engagement ring from Yadav Jewelry. The way my ring sparkles is amazing. I get so many compliments and even my friends tell me omg I can’t stop staring at your ring. Their customer service is wonderful and they respond to emails promptly. I recommend Yadav 1000%, you can’t find the quality of jewelry for the prices they give ANYWHERE. Trust me, we did a lot of research and came across Yadav after being unsatisfied with a ring from a different online jeweler. We look forward to purchasing more jewelry from Yadav in the near future<//Text>< Date>

My fiancé and I were so nervous buying a ring online (as I'm sure many are) and wow, we are so glad we did. Most local jewelry stores were incredibly overpriced (as many jewelry stores are, they have rent to pay). When my fiancé found Rare Carat and we saw their reputation and the quality of vendors they worked with we knew we had a winner. Yadav has the highest quality diamonds and jewelry and their pricing is very competitive. I interacted with Yadav and Rare Carat throughout the purchase process and their staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. I know my fiancé and I will be repeat customers and we've already started telling our friends and family who are considering getting married/buying their spouses jewelry about them. I am so thankful to you both for having such excellent customer service and reasonable prices.  Thank you so much for caring about your customers. Thank you so much for having such high quality products and such great quality control. I am so grateful to have such a beautiful ring. Every time I look at it I am reminded of the team at Yadav and Rare Carat and smile. Thank you all for making it such an incredible experience!!!!<//Text>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Amazing experience and more amazing rings!

We visited multiple stores in search for a lab grown diamond engagement ring. We looked at some of the bigger names (rare carat and brilliant earth). But we followed a recommendation to check-out Yadav and it trumped the rest. Particularly because the offered:
- Full customization of the ring
- Best selection of diamonds to choose from (we were very particular)
- Lowest price we could find in the market

Some nice bonuses that made us happy we picked them:
- They allowed us to swap the diamond itself a few days after placing the order
- Purchase included 30 days of insurance from the moment they handed us the ring
- Joe, the owner, and his staff were wonderful to deal with, knowledgable, and fair with their prices

Honestly, I can't recommend them enough.< /Review><time>1599270151796<//time><Gmap_id>0x808f7e2c76ec340f:0x828e09b5c38cbe2d<//Gmap_id><rating>5< /rating>< Pics>

Live all the way in oklahoma, but they had exactly what I wanted to fit the diamond I had chosen. They worked with me very well. Shipping was very secure and I appreciated that. When I had to have my wife's ring resized the got it done very quickly and was super easy!! we love our ring!!</Review>

Oustanding customer service!  I ordered her engagement ring in March and just purchased the matching wedding band in December.

The team at Yadav was great to work with and very friendly, they also have some of the best prices out there.

They shipped within a few days of my ordered, and I received both orders in excellent condition.

I spent a lot of time looking for the best value, but should have started with Yadav, because it would have saved me a lot of time.<//Review>

<review>Great experience with working with Layla from Yadav to source my diamond and design the band for my engagement ring! She said, "Yes"! And absolutely loves her ring. My only constructive feedback would be that the custom-designed rings should come in an unmarked ring box, rather than one with the name of the designer on top and inside.<//review>< Pictures>

<text>I was first a bit skeptical about buying a diamond online. As probably the third largest purchase in my life, after home and car, I would like to see the stone in person, before I make the decision. However, I took the, what I thought was, risk. Looking back, I have no regret.

Nan was the sales helped me, highly recommend. However, I did dealt with a different person, forgot her name, she wasn't very pleasant. Nan replies message quickly and clearly, great communication. And the transaction was easy, and was able to accommodate my special request - nothing crazy, but just very tight timeline.

The stone and the ring are well above my expectation. I got something look well and seem to be consistent as they advertised. No complain at all.

Overall, my experience is very good. I would recommend this jewelry shop to anyone when asked, and likely would come back for other purchase.</text>< pics>

I was able to find the engagement ring that my fiancé wanted for a great price.  I live in Southern California so the staff helped send me pictures and videos of the diamond. Sure enough, I liked it and pulled the trigger, it took a week for the ring to be ready and 3 days for the ring to be delivered. I requested for the package to be discreet. about 2 months later I decided to bend the knee to my now fiancé and she hasn't stopped looking at the ring since then. It was beautiful and affordable. Thank you staff at Yadav.<//text>

My husband and I had a great experience with Yadav jewelers. We first purchased my engagement rings with them (pre pandemic) and loved their customer service. We also purchased our wedding bands there (post pandemic) and they were able to help us just as expertly as before. We also loved their association with Zillion insurance, it made the insurance buying process easy and expedient.<//text>

I am very happy with  the service provided by Yadav Diamonds and Jewelry.
I needed  to get a diamond by a certain day  in the  near future so I was looking for a reliable Jeweler. But I did not want to over pay for the stone just because  I need to get it right away. In searching for a Jeweler, I found Yadav Diamonds and Jewelry in Rare Carat among trusted Jewelers. The price was very competitive and they acknowledged right  away the availability of the particular stone with certain qualities. As promised, I received the stone  days before promised. I will recommend Yadav Diamond  & Jewelry for your stone. I would not hesitate to purchase more stones from them.</Text>

After searching multiple stores I settled on Yadav jewelers for a diamond ring. The overall value of the ring and the diamond was outstanding. The site was very easy to navigate and their staff was tremendously responsive. It can be unnerving to buy expensive items online but Yadav Jewelers simplified the process and eased my nerves.
Overall very happy with the ring and had a great experience.<//review>

They are the most helpful and educated gemologists that I could have asked for. A detail that I realized was crucial was that they adapt and know what you mean when asking a question and can give suggestions accordingly. Would highly recommend that everyone speak with the team!< /Text>

I ordered an engagement ring for my now Fiancé all online. I took a risk that Yadav would be able to get everything together in time since it was the holiday season. I received the ring a week earlier than expected and she loved it. I would 100% recommend Yadav for any of your jewelry needs. Also, the customer service was great! Any email I sent I would get a response in less than 24 business hours.< /review>

Easily the friendliest, most helpful jeweler I've worked with thus far! Given the covid situation I was hesitant to go through the process of looking for and purchasing an engagement ring solely online, but Suzy was so, so incredibly helpful in helping me find the perfect diamond. Yadav also offers what I've found to be the best and most fair price for their diamonds compared to the other jewelers I've looked at. Can't recommend Yadav enough!<//text>

It was a pleasant experience doing business with Yadav.  After eight months of researching the market and shopping for the right diamond, Yadav proved what all of their reviews were saying.  I got an amazing diamond for much less than what I could find comparable diamonds for elsewhere.  Thank you to the Yadav team!<//Review>

After doing a great deal of research I purchased a beautiful diamond ring from Yadav Diamonds.  The diamond quality was exceptional and the price was better than at other sites.  The ring was made and sent promptly.  They honored my request to size the ring to the nearest 1/8 as opposed to 1/4.  I will definitely use Yadav again .<//Review>

I mistakenly, picked the wrong size for my girl, once I received the ring communicated back to Yadav and Yadav right away said "No problem" they sent me a prepaid envelop for Fedex and I sent my ring back to get it sized correctly. Yadav made it into an incredible experience all the way through.< /Review>< pics>

<review>Purchased a diamond for an engagement ring. Everything about the process was great. As you can imagine making a large purchase over the internet can be a bit nerve racking, but they made the process easy. They communicated with me regularly and continually updated me with tracking numbers. I would definitely do business with them again.< /review>< Pictures>

I have no complaints with the diamond I purchased, it was a great deal and a beautiful rock. The customer service team was very helpful and quick to answer questions. I had to resize the ring after purchase and the whole process was very easy.  Highly recommend Yadav.< /text>

I was curious about the differences between natural diamonds and manufactured diamonds. I started researching online. I was sent an e-mail by Vivian from Yadav Diamonds and Jewelry because I had briefly been on their web-site. Vivian was extremely knowledgeable.She listened to my concerns and responded with the information she had but also encouraged me to research her statements further if I needed any clarification. I did. I was pleased to see that her information/advise held up to the scrutiny of the vast internet. Vivian/Yadav took me from 50% certain I wanted to purchase a manufactured diamond to a terrific Christmas Surprise for my wife.  I began looking around December 15th and had a fantastic 1.53 carat diamond on my wife's  hand Christmas Morning. I Live 3,000 miles from their retail store so all of this was done on line.The diamond is magnificent and the service was spectacular. The pricing was better than all of the other,major names in diamonds that can be found on line. The value provided has me recommending Vivian and Yadav to anyone who asks me about their commitment to excellence both in product and service, and when people see my wife's ring,the questions begin to flow.<//review>

<Review>I am writing this review largely in part due to the amazing customer service I received from Nan. I have never in my life met a customer service associate who is more responsive and helpful than her. Thank you Nan, you are amazing!

Unfortunately, there were a few hiccups when it came to my ring. My fiancé found Yadav through Rare Carat. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love my ring. However, there were a couple flaws which should not have passed their quality control when it comes to an engagement ring. I had to send my ring back in for a resize as it was too big. The process to ship the ring back was extremely easy (thanks to Nan) and I was able to receive it back in a week. But when I got it back, I realized that it was crooked and there were two gaps in the ring (as pictured). I had taken a couple pictures before sending it back as well which I was able to show as proof that the gaps happened after the resizing. Thankfully, Yadav agreed to take the ring back and fix the gaps which I was very grateful for, though I was now anxious I would have to ship my ring back a second time and be apart from it for another week. When I got my ring back for the final time (two pictures against white marbled background), the gap on the part of the band with the row of diamonds had been fixed (yay!) But the gap in the middle still remains.

I love my ring so much and don't want to part with it anymore, so I don't mind the gap too much as it is pretty hard to see unless you're extremely close and scrutinizing. I would just think, for such an expensive ring with such a beautiful diamond, you'd hope the quality is 100%.

All in all, amazing customer service but 1 star off for the quality control.< /Review>< Pics>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>I am STUNNED by Yadav's service. I'd been in awe looking at their diamonds online for awhile now, which are consistently priced very competitively, and I found a pair of 3/4 total carat weight diamond studs for the same cost as the best-priced 1/2 carat studs from anywhere else (and Yadav's were better quality, too!) in December. After wearing them for 3 months straight (true everyday earrings!), the back of one of the earrings fell out when I was in public, and I couldn't find it. At 4:50pm today (Friday) I called to ask if I could come in to get a replacement backing (hoping it would only cost $100-200), and the very nice woman on the phone said they would have availability for me to come in today! When I arrived an employee was very nice and found a backing that matched my earring. Then she said I was good to go? And that the replacement backing is complimentary as part of their service guarantee?! As someone with a tendency to lose things, my mind is blown! We didn't pay up for the service guarantee, and I didn't even have to provide any proof of purchase. I understand how valuable service is, but you're not even paying up for the service -- it's almost the opposite! I fully recommend Yadav to the internet, just as I have for a friend who got their wedding rings and engagement ring at Yadav a couple months ago!

TL;DR: best prices and service in the jewelry industry< /Text>< Pics>

Sheila sent me an email and was able to talk back and forth.  We spoke by phone and she made all the difference!  Helped me find everything I wanted and walked me through my purchase.  The ring is amazing and would highly recommend Yadav!< /review><pics>None<//pics></record></dataset><record>

I could have never gotten such a good pricing for the ring I bought. Sheila was really helpful and walked me through every step of the process. She knows her diamonds well, and took the time to explain all the characteristics of the diamonds I was looking at. She also provided recommendations based on the inventory they had and the diamonds that they were going to get. I finally narrowed it down to 2 diamonds and she told which one to pick and we have no regrets. It was the perfect stone and fit so well in the setting we chose. I would definitely recommend Yadav, and specifically Sheila. Especially if you don't know much about diamonds or rings, she's your person to go to.  The only negative was the cleaning price and servicing, but for the overall price we got, it was definitely not a deal breaker at all.< /review>

Great experience with Yadav! I did have some concerns but they alleviated all of that in a hurry. Purchased online and had a beautiful ring on about 10 days. Communication was great. My fiance loves the ring and I couldn't be happier with the price and process. Highly recommended.</text>

<review>Yadav is like family to us, from our first meeting a couple years ago we've felt like a part of the Yadav family. Maytal, and her father Jim have been wonderful helping us with our diamond selections...in October 2020 we purchased my Mother a beautiful love bracelet, she turned 80 and it was a great surprise! My Christmas gift this past year, was a lovely diamond band from my honey which Maytal made happen with her wonderful expertise and care. Thank you to Yadav Diamonds & Jewelry for being so thoughtful, professional and caring to us. We send you our heartfelt thanks and blessings.< /review><user>110743409457370380529</user>< Pictures>

<Review>I purchased an engagement ring from Yadav, including the center stone and the setting. The process was easy. I used an online appraisal service to have this and other stones evaluated. The online service with certified gemologists strongly recommended I purchase the Yadav stone for being an exceptional price and diamond. With that endorsement I purchased it with no issues. It arrived on time and was gorgeous. Although I initially was concerned about purchasing online, it was a very easy experience. I had a small issue and the Yadav team was very helpful and arranged for me to send the stone to them and then back to me. I have no complaints and look forward to purchasing other jewelry from them in the future. I highly recommend with no reservations.</Review></record>

I purchased loose diamonds site unseen online to be put into studs for earrings becuase they had the best prices and I wanted to lock in my purchase! After making my choice I made a trip to the shop to view the stones in person and confirm my purchase. With the shelter in place order it was hard to get into the building so the staff graciously met me outside so I could view the diamonds in natural light. They were quick to set the stones and I picked up my complete purchase within a few days! Highly recomend Yadav, they were great to work with and provided a great product. The earrings look great!< /Review>

I was nervous making this large of a purchase online but going through the process and comparing against other sites online was a breeze. I even had a phone consultation to explain the difference between a few diamonds that met the requirements of what I was looking for. My (now) fiance loves the ring and is happy and impressed with what I picked out. Yadav is now at the top of my list anytime I want to purchase jewelry.< /Review>

<review>Yadav made my ring buying experience feel so special! Their customer experience reps were always excited to answer my questions and my ring arrived promptly and in beautiful condition. My now fiancé and I feel like we got a STEAL for my ring. The quality blew us away and they had the best selection of settings. We purchased a lab created diamond. For anyone considering companies like Brilliant Earth, I’d pick Yadav over the big guys time and time again!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x808f7e2c76ec340f:0x828e09b5c38cbe2d</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Yadav had so many options to choose from and I was able to get a great idea of what Diamond I was ordering with their online viewing options.  The ring arrived looking even more shiny and sparkly than it looked online and I couldn't find a complaint if I needed to.<//review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>I was skeptical at first looking online for an engagement ring. I shopped around and researched different companies when I found Yadav Diamonds & Jewelry. The reviews seemed really well overall and their website was easy to navigate. Their selection of diamonds and settings was vast. I decided to purchase an engagement ring through their store without ever setting foot inside. I built the ring and purchased it with ease. The ring came in and it was better than I expected. It's beautiful and exactly what I was looking for.

The customer service is OUTSTANDING!!! I have never had better customer service from a jewelry store than Yadav. I don't know if I've ever had better service from any store or business as a matter of fact. They were very helpful through the entire process. They responded quickly to every need or request I had before and after making a purchase. I would recommend using Yadav to anybody if you're looking to buy jewelry. I will be coming back to purchase an wedding band and a wedding ring (for me) in the future. I'd give them 6 stars if I could but I can't.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>My wife and I absolutely love the ring we purchased. Yadav offered the best price that no other retailer could come close to. We were skeptical at first, but after doing research and speaking with their experts, we understand and are very happy with our purchase. We also really loved their customer service. Their staff was really helpful.<//review>< response>

<text>I worked with Yadav (after being referred to them) to purchase an engagement ring and their staff was very friendly and helpful throughout the entire process. They happily answered my questions, and made my experience (which was entirely remote due to COVID) very pleasant. I would absolutely work with them again.<//text>< gmapID>

I researched for months at rarecarat.com and I found the best diamond for a great price via YADAV. I become a master at cut, color, and clarity - lol. They were great with communication back to me on the diamond and ring while it was being produced. They even next-day’d it to me to insure it was here in time for the proposal. She gets compliments everyday on the finished product. Thanks again for making our day so perfect!<//Review>

I was very impressed with the process of buying an engagement ring from Yadav. I was able to complete the purchase 100% through email. Every step of the way Susan was there to answer my questions and made me feel very comfortable. I received the perfect ring and she said yes! Thank you so much.</Review>

<Text>Amazing experience buying from Yadav! I was worried about buying a ring online, but due to the global pandemic I had few options. Yadav made it as painless as possible, providing candid feedback during the shopping process and bringing me along the journey with a 3D rendering of the final product. My fiancee was blown away with the ring, and it was all made possible by Yadav. I'm still convinced I got the best value from Yadav compared to any other diamond retailer (and I shopped A LOT).<//Text>< pics>

<Text>Yadav has been a wonderful Company to work with. From designing a ring, to getting it resized (twice), they have been so helpful. They are sincere and trustworthy, which can be rare in the diamond industry. Their prices are also unbeatable! HIGHLY RECOMMEND, for any occasion.</Text>< time>

Absolutely amazing doing business with them. I had a custom design in mind for my engagement ring and was nervous about the final result. They took longer than expected because of multiple issues during CoVID but when the ring came in the mail, I could not have been happier. Amazing craftsmanship and beautiful ring. Exactly how I wanted it. I get compliments on it all the time. Thank you<//text>

My only gripe is that there was a fingerprint and some fuzz on the ring when I opened the box the first time.  I cleaned it off no biggy.  I like to think the last person sending it off couldn’t stop admiring it.  Would recommend!!<//review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x808f7e2c76ec340f:0x828e09b5c38cbe2d< /gmapID></record>

<text>I spent some time looking for diamonds online using rarecarat.com  and Yadav had a few stones I kept my eye on that were within my price range with the specs I wanted. Yadav listed easy to read info about the diamond, shipped incredibly fast and had good communication as well.
The packaging of the diamond was really incredible, it was so neat to see that beautiful stone in the little metal tin they provided I wanted to show my future finance! Boxing was tasteful and all the paperwork was in quality envelopes as well which I still use to keep safe.
I would absolutely recommend them to someone looking to buy online.</text><user_id>100196809984493728724<//user_id><name>Sean Fleming< /name></record>

<text>Went to their show room trying to order for an engagement ring today. The sales lady sat nearest to the door greeted us with a few words, said would help us in a few minutes and asked us to sit and wait. And we waited for about 20 minutes, she was firstly busy knocking on her keyboard and then simply ignored us and went straight to another costumer came later than us to pick up his order and he has already had a salesman helping him. During this time even other sales in the store saw us sitting there waiting they didn’t even bother asking whether we need assistance. And I guess they just can’t wait to see us walking out of their door so they don’t have to serve us. The show room is just like a UPS/Fedex delivery room and they prefer to do business with customers who shop online and won’t waste their time giving actually services. Got so disappointed and mad at the service( we’ll consider we wasn’t actually given any) and if you don’t mind shopping with this attitude then go ahead and put order online, maybe you will even be on their Instagram to be part of their virtual advertisement.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x808f7e2c76ec340f:0x828e09b5c38cbe2d<//GmapID></record>

Everyone at Yadav was so friendly and helpful from my very first email inquiry to the prompt delivery of my jewelry. I love that they are an independent, family-owned business. They have excellent customer service and very high quality pieces at competitive prices. It is clear that they truly care about their work and they went above and beyond to make sure I absolutely loved my new piece of jewelry. I can’t recommend Yadav enough and I will definitely be going to them for my next project!</review>

Yadav did an amazing job. I shopped on a site that had several different companies but I had heard great things about them as a company and they offered diamonds that were superior in quality for an amazing price giving me the most for my dollar. My new Fiancèe loves it and her ring definitely gets noticed everywhere we go. I had NEVER thought to purchase a diamond online and was a little hesitant but the diamond came on time and with all the right certifications and everything!</Review>

Absolutely the best. Yadav made sure that our diamond would arrive in time for our last-minute proposal. The value and customer service exceeds all other locations that I visited in the last few weeks. I'm thrilled with our purchase, and though we can say that that there won't be anymore engagement ring shopping, we will come back soon for our wedding bands. Thank you!<//text>

Yadav was an excellent resource in finding exactly what I was looking for. I gave them very specific criteria, and although there were no stones that matched at the time I made the request, they were able to find a perfect example fairly quickly. Additionally, the look I wanted for the setting was a blend of 2 different rings they carried (very thin band, 6 prongs). They custom made the setting and produced exactly what I needed.
Don’t worry about being picky with these guys, they are very understandIng and a pleasure to work with.< /review>

I went in person pre pandemic to see what diamond and ring my gf would like. We had a blast! It was one hell of an experience! The owner and I believe hos daughter helped us and they made it so easy to understand while making the experience fun and enjoyable. I ended up buying the ring and diamond in February during the pandemic and the help online with his staff was above and beyond! I def recommend! Also my gf is now my fiancé and she loves the ring sooo much and so do all our friends!!<//Review>

high quality diamonds for good prices, easy to deal with, good deals

I bought an engagement ring from them online and the process was smooth and easy. They were very professional and had good deals. I was worried about buying something like this online and was worried about scams, but Yadav is 100% legitimate and have excellent deals. I had a great experience.< /review>

I had a few questions that they quickly answered and made my choice simple.   I got exactly what I wanted in a diamond and found several unique setting.   I few minutes later I made a decision and a purchase.

They kept me informed as the diamond was set and the ring was shipped.

Exceptional customer service. Layla helped me with the buying process for my engagement ring and ensured it got here before my wedding date. I was weary buying a diamond online after being sent a fake diamond ring from Natalie Diamond prior to Yadav. I was sure to get the ring Yadav sent me tested for authenticity. When I asked a local jeweler if they had a diamond tester, they immediately said that they didn't need one to know that the ring on my finger was real. It's not like they even held my hand and looked at the ring, either! They were several feet away from me and could tell that this ring was not a fake! That made me incredibly happy. Just in case though, I took it to a Kay's jeweler and had them test it and of course it tested as diamond. I am now looking into a band upgrade for my current setting on Yadav's website.</Text>

<Text>Buying my fiancé’s engagement ring through YADAV was the best decision I could have made. They were very fast at finishing and shipping the ring. They even made special changes to the ring that I wanted done. I saved thousands of dollars using this service and would recommend it to anyone wanting to purchase diamond jewelry without paying the huge extra cost from big name retail stores.</Text><Resp>None< /Resp><name>Shawn Barker<//name>< rating>

Ordered my fiance's ring from Yadav from the east coast. Their sales department was awesome. They were on top of everything I asked of them and never seemed to care about the sale but just to make sure I was happy with the product I got. Which was amazing, my fiance loved it.< /text>

<review>I purchased my fiance's engagement ring from Yadav. I did this over the internet, which always makes me a little nervous. I must say, the ring is simply astounding, breathtaking even. I could not be happier and she can't go anywhere without being asked to see it. I highly recommend them.<//review>< pics>

< Review>
Yadàv over delivers on the quality and value of their rings. I brought a 1.5 carat princess cut channel set engagement ring with the matching eternal band for my now wife. When she went to get the set appraised, the rings literally appraised for 90% above the cost I paid for them, nearly double my money. My wife gets complemented on the weekly basis, which is saying a lot because we barely go out given the Covid pandemic. I would highly recommend anyone looking to get a great value without sacrificing the quality of the center stone.</Review>

Spent hours picking out the right ring. Ordered it and had it delivered to my parents so my girlfriend didn't see it. Then I get an email indicating Yadav's insurance won't cover the shipment if the billing and delivery addresses don't match. BUT if I pay by wire transfer, then the insurance would cover it. Don't know if it's a scam, or if it's the silliest policy ever, but I will never do business with this company again.</Review>

I got my fiancé’s ring from yadav, and it was amazing! I felt that I spent a reasonable amount for a ring that is truly beautiful and was exactly what I wanted (and what she wanted). I had some questions and they answered every thing and kept me updated to make sure I knew when my ring was showing up. Next time I get engaged I’ll definitely use Yadav again.< /Review>

The ring I received was beyond beautiful.  Customer service was pleasant and responded pretty quick.

I wanted to visit the store but getting in the building during COVID was complicated.  Their customer service team worked with me to get me the ring fast for my proposal plans.  Worked out fantastic.

Definitely would go back to them.<//text>

<text>Yadav is simply the best! I purchased my fiancé’s engagement ring from them and we could not be happier! She has received countless compliments on how beautiful the ring is. The shopping process is made really easy with the 360° view of the diamonds, and my diamond looks just as pictured. The customer service is also great! One of their reps informed me that the original diamond I selected would not fit into my chosen setting very well and sent a recommendation for a different one. Other companies probably wouldn’t have done the same. Yadav will be my number one recommendation to friends and family!!<//text><Rating>5< /Rating></record>

First class customer service.  Maytal and the team of professionals at Yadav Jewelry tirelessly worked with me throughout the jewelry selection process.  This is not easy to do virtually, and from the east coast.  I had reservations making such a significant investment without setting foot in their location.  My fears were relieved during the process, and completely erased when the engagement setting arrived.  My fiancée receives compliments on her arrangement regularly.  Thank you Yadav Jewelry!< /Text>

I purchased a beautiful 2.01 radiant stone and had it set (Sondra setting)  in platinum. I also purchased the matching band. I celebrate my 40th year with my husband and couldn't find a more quality priced ring anywhere. Even my local jeweler was surprised at the price for the quality of stone. I had purchased a stone from another company, but canceled it once I saw this stone. Thank you Yadav. I love it.<//review>

<Text>Yadav did a great job with our engagement ring and they have been very easy to work with. I went through Rare Carat, and Yadav was seamless on fulfilling my order and getting exactly what I needed. They make it easy if you need to make any adjustments to the jewelry, and the pricing they offered was very competitive. I would use Yadav in the future for other jewelry needs.<//Text>< GmapID>

Yadav was awesome from the start. Even when I stupidly forgot to put a size on the ring I ordered, they immediately contacted me to ensure my order would be correct and asked me what size I needed. Ring came sized correctly. They provided FAST two-day shipping with insured shipping. A lot of piece of mind. Ring arrived exactly how I pictured it. It came with grading paper work (free) and appraisal (at small extra cost). They also provided 10-days of full insurance coverage for free so that you can spend time to find the insurance plan that is just right for you. Absolutely wonderful experience with Yadav. I highly recommend!< /text>

<Review>I had a online purchase of a Diamond ring from Yadav 9 months ago. it was such a Seamless process. I was wondering that I purchase a diamond ring by online at the very first time, but everytime I called with a question I was greeted by a very friendly employee and I got clear answer from them. My diamond arrived at my doorstep quickly and had no issues. I recommend them to anyone looking for a beautiful diamond at a fair price!</Review>< UserId.>

Making such a big buy online was nerve wracking for my fiance but everything went smoothly and as promised. Not only is my ring  absolutely beautiful but the customer service is excellent as well. After receiving the ring it needed to be resized. A customer service rep responded quickly and let us know how to mail it back for resizing. We were nervous about the process but again Yadav made the process easy and returned the ring quickly.<//text><response>None</response>< GmapID>

I purchased a Diamond from Yadav about 6 months ago and it was such a SEAMLESS process. Everytime I called with a question I was greeted by a very friendly employee and my questions and concerns were addressed and handled with empathy and haste.  My diamond arrived at my doorstep quickly and without any issue! I will buy from them again in the future and recommend them to anyone looking for a beautiful diamond at a fair price!<//Text>

Yadav was amazing to work with. While my wife was in a coma after a tragic accident, they custom-made a halo diamond necklace that matches my wife’s engagement ring at a very reasonable price. The diamond selection is large and great quality, as is the craftmanship. My wife has worn the necklace everyday since coming home from the hospital and hasn’t taken it off.</text>

My wife loves the engagement ring we got from Yadav! They allowed me to create the perfect ring for her, and it arrived on time in great condition. And it was less expensive than similar rings in local jewelry shops. They did a great job, will buy jewelry from them again in the future.<//review>

And the fact it was a lab grown diamond also made me a little hesitant. But i do not regret, it was a perfect business transaction and i must say, the service was great but the product was even better than expected. My fiancé loved it!! It still sparkles a year later. Now that i can trust Yadav i will buy again from them but bigger.</text>< name>

<review>I wanted to wait to post a review until after proposing to my girlfriend in the case she may stumble on the review. Well after 10 months of initially receiving my engagement ring, here’s my review of Yadav Jewelers! Up until the purchase, I spent countless hours of researching the many options for an engagement ring. When I was directed to Yadav’s by Rare Carat, I instantly had that “this is it” feeling. Living in Portland, OR and the store being in San Francisco, there was a lot of anxiety with shipping but I was pleased to say it was very seamless and secure! The actual ring is very beautiful, my fiancé absolutely loves it, and I would definitely recommend insuring it with Zillion insurance. 10/10 would recommend a friend to shop at Yadav’s for their jewelry needs.<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>I bought my fiance's engagement ring from Yadav. I generally knew the diamond I wanted from rarecarat.com. They helped me match the diamond to a platinum solitaire band, addressed my concerns about shipping, and advised me on a mating wedding band. The ring arrived when expected, and my fiance treasures it!</Text><gmap_id>0x808f7e2c76ec340f:0x828e09b5c38cbe2d< /gmap_id>< user_id>

From picking out the diamond to getting the finished product, Yadav went above and beyond our expectations. It arrived when they said it would, it appraised for what they said it would.and the quality is excellent. We would definitely recommend Yadav to our friends and family for their diamond needs.< /text>

<Review>They were excellent throughout the whole process. They answered phone calls timely and helped me pick out small key features of the ring before I bought it. After I placed the order I wanted to make a change and they were very easy to work with. The ring turned out beautiful! I mailed it back to have it resized and it was a very easy process. Everything was better than expected from start to finish. I would highly recommend Yadav to any of my friends and family.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

When shopping for a lab grown diamond, it was very difficult to know which option to go with, and what store.  Yadav is based on CA, I am based in FL, but they sent multiple videos and answered all my questions.  If you're in the market, I'd highly recommend them.  Their prices were essentially the cheapest and the service was great.

If I had to buy another lab grown diamond, I would go straight there.<//Text>

They were awesome, so helpful and patient with me. I worked with one sales rep the entire time to take my vision (what my now fiance said she'd like) and they made it perfectly! I explained what I wanted, they made a CAD drawing, and sent to me to proof. From there it didn't take long at all, and my fiance absolutely loves the ring. She said it was much nicer than anything she envisioned!!! I loved the fact that we customized the ring to be one of a kind, exactly how she wanted, and came out beautifully :)
Also the sales rep recommended a better metal than I was thinking, I didn't know much about diamonds and metals, and the sales rep helped guide me to the perfect ring.<//text>

<Text>I live on the East Coast and was working with a jeweler in Canada on a Custom engagement and wedding ring combo but he didn’t do diamonds so he recommended me to “ Yadav Diamonds “ for the stones. What a welcome surprise. They couldn’t have been more helpful they helped me select the right stones and supplied the exact measurements for my jeweler. The communication from them was awesome until the stones were delivered. Thank you for seamless process. The Diamonds are stunning !
P. S. Did I mention that Yadav's pricing was excellent !!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Time>1603157270660< /Time><Review>Yadav provided from the beginning of selecting a special 30 year anniversary diamond ring until I received the ring this year the highest exceptional  simple straightforward service. The diamond ring was the highest quality possible for the price but the art work complimented what I requested and was very satisfied. It was a pleasure working with Layla and the team. If you are looking for diamond rings or jewelry - you should always give Yadav a chance since you will be amazed what they can do for you.</Review></record>

<text>Great experience with Yadav online and over the phone.  Great products with  clear, disclosed GIA Certification and #'s.  From my experience you can feel confident buying through Yadav's online presence.  Also, make time to get in touch with them directly to connect the relationship.  I certainly recommend and will buy with them again.<//text>< username>

Great spot. Had a friend get their engagement ring here as well as myself! Worked with Layla, and she was not only very helpful and informed, but not pushy and really gave me a slew of options to figure out the right budget. She always responded very promptly over both email and phone. My fiancé loved the ring.< /text>

I can’t begin to say enough good things about my experience with Yadav Jewelry!  Everything was so effortless and easy.  I worked with Shiela on everything and she went above and beyond. Answered all the questions I had, always very fast to reply, was easily available via email or text. I couldn’t have asked for better service! On top of that, some of the best pricing I’ve seen online after months of searching. I will definitely shop with them again!<//text>

I found Yadav via RareCarat.com and noticed that their pricing remained extremely competitive for diamonds. In addition, their ring settings are very reasonably priced and include a broad variety of options for both design and metals. Their website is user friendly and they do a great job of keeping it up to date. Lastly, the reason why I gave them 5 stars, in addition to everything already mentioned is that they have exceptional customer service. I needed a diamond shipped from overseas, mounted on a ring, and shipped to me before the date I was planning to propose and they certainly over delivered. I called in and emailed their team regarding the urgency around the matter and they were responsive on all communication channels. They have certainly earned my business in the future and acquired a life long customer. Thank you, Yadav.</Text>

<text>The customer service was incredible! I was traveling out of the country and they made sure I had my Diamond before I left. My fiancée LOVES the diamond and so do I. I can confidently recommend Yadav for all your jewelry needs. These people are the best and it shows.

Great experience purchasing an engagement ring. The online selection process for the ring and the diamond was simple and straight forward. Pricing was great and the sparkle of the diamond didn’t disappoint and still hasn’t 2 years later. Thank you.<//text>

<review>I love Yadav! I was skeptical to say the least about order a diamond online. After reading other reviews and return policies,  I decided to take a chance. It was one of the decisions I ever made. The process was easy and the support staff communication was excellent.  The diamond is breathe taking! Don't hesitate to buy just do it .< /review><Gmap_id>0x808f7e2c76ec340f:0x828e09b5c38cbe2d< /Gmap_id>< user_id>

Before starting my search for a ring I knew absolutely nothing about jewelry or diamonds. Thanks to Layla’s knowledge and patience she helped me create a ring I could’ve never imagined. Leaving only one thing for my Girlfriend to say when I showed her this masterpiece, YES!!

Thank You Yadav for the excellent service and craftsmanship, my Fiancé hates taking off her ring;)</review>

One of my best retail experiences.

The ring was exactly as expected - the site is every extremely informative and almost feels as if you are shopping in person.

They also have Gemologist available on chat to clear questions if any which makes the process extremely easy.<//Text>

<text>Maytal and the whole team at Yadav took such amazing care of me and my fiancé while we were ring shopping. I appreciated their honesty and opinion in selecting a style. They really wanted to make sure that we were completely happy with our purchase and did not hesitate to make a few changes to my ring to make it exactly how I wanted. I can’t thank them enough for their care and attention to detail with something so special as our wedding rings!

They were patient every step of the way and went above and beyond to make ring shopping an enjoyable process! It’s the only jewelry store my fiancé actually enjoys going into and we will be life long customers for sure!< /text><Rating>5<//Rating><Time>1610387679801< /Time><UserId.>100789909557700901663< /UserId.></record>

<Text>They were overall GREAT!  First they spent lots of time with me in choosing and matching the diamonds for stud earrings we were giving to our mom for her 90th birthday.  Then they got them to us quickly and in perfect condition for gifting.  And our mom was really so very happy with her gift.  Layla even sent us extra post backs in case mom lost one or two.  Thank you very much for everything.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< UserId.>

My husband and I decided that we would celebrate our ten year anniversary by upgrading my engagement ring with a diamond. I had helped choose the original centerstone a decade ago, which was an inexpensive (i.e. $65) light green prasiolite in a chunky size. Yadav's excellent sales reps helped us choose the most beautiful diamond in exactly the dimensions and characteristics we were hoping for to fit my current setting. Yadav did a perfect job with the prong metal work and returned my upgraded ring plus my original stone in a gorgeous box, complete with paperwork. When I first reached out to Yadav, it was just to browse online and learn how much money we should start saving....but it turns out that the diamond and metalwork was a few thousand less than we expected so we bought a 1.80 carat(!) dream diamond right away. It's seriously breathtaking and I am so very happy to have felt so supported in finding exactly what we/I wanted. Thank you, Yadav, for a safe and happy transaction!!<//text>

<text>Yadav is amazing. I ordered an engagement ring right when the country started locking down and Yadav made sure I got the ring on time.

I actually ended up sending that ring back after speaking with a Yadav rep who helped me pick out exactly what I was looking for and even recommended setting the diamond low since my fiancé wanted a more low profile ring. The return process was super easy and I got the perfect ring back quickly.

After the proposal, we needed to send it back for resizing and gain the process was very easy and Yadav was extremely responsive.

Keep in mind that this entire ordeal took place during the lock down.

I highly recommend Yadav, for the value, excellent customer service, and knowledgeable employees.< /text>< Pics>

Using Yadav as a first time experience was really positive. It's a reputable company and service who link you to other reputable dealers. Quality and certification, with insurance for international postage was a must and is there with all purchases. Hassle free, worry free and all with no risks given it was insured for the journey! Their customer service was also top shelf, so it was an overall perfect experience for me!<//text>

I went to Yadav for an upgrade, the owner himself called me to make sure I understood the diamonds and the grading, etc.; not only did I change my ring once, but within 30 days changed my mind and changed it again! Each time Maytal was very good in getting back with me, asking me questions and I have the ring of my dreams today!  You can't beat the price either compared to high end retail chains.  Recommend for your diamond needs!< /review>

Best prices anywhere you can find. After shopping around for months in NYC Diamond District, and being hesitant to shop online, I decided to make the purchase due to the guarantee and return policy. Upon receiving, I also had it independently appraised and couldn’t be happier with the ring. The diamond was even better than expected. Fast, reliable, shipping and packaging. Definitely recommended.<//text>

I was searching for a loose diamond for a setting that I had already purchased. The price point and quality of Yadav cannot be beat. I purchased the diamond online and chatted with one of their representatives through their online chat system. They promptly responded and answered all of my questions. Shipping was easy and the stone came in a really cool aluminum housing to protect it. The stone in person was beautiful and was everything I was hoping it would be. Thank you!<//Text>

<Text>I ordered an engagement diamond through this company after seeing the one I liked on Rarecarat and had it shipped to me. Normally I make large purchases like this in person, especially if it was jewelry, so that I can inspect it and don't have to worry about shipping. Luckily, they had detailed descriptions, photos, and 360 video of the diamond itself so I felt confident enough to make the purchase.

Shipping was very very secure as the diamond was wonderfully packaged in its own little metal capsule, in a weighty box, inside shipping bag, inside a medium box, then AGAIN inside a large shipping box. It had multiple layers of protection and there was no way of telling it was a multi thousand dollar diamond inside. It also required signature on delivery.

The customer service was quick to respond if I wanted a refund, exchange, or shipping updates. The only downside was that the shipping took about two weeks.

Fiance absolutely loves the diamond and gets compliments on it all the time. Keep in mind this was a lab grown, 1,63, ideal cut, oval, vvs2, colorless, all for $4300. Robins Brothers wanted $10,000 for an equivalent lab grown diamond.

That is the last taboo, not related to this company. We were skeptical about getting a lab grown and the comments that may come along with it so we went to check out both lab grown and mined diamonds in person. The salesperson laid 3 lab grown and 3 mined in front of us to let us decide which one is which. After feeling confident on our choices we were completely wrong. There is no way to tell by eye the difference between lab grown and mined unless youre an absolute expert on it. So fellas, you can go up in size and quality by going this route.<//Text>< Pics>

Had a great experience with Yadav when purchasing my fiance's engagement ring. They worked with me over the phone and by email to make sure the ring, setting, and everything else was exactly as my fiance wanted. Would highly recommend!<//Review>

Fiance is extremely happy with her engagement ring, and we were able to get a high quality diamond for a great price. Price differences for what I was looking at came down to 0.1 degree differences in cut, so do your research thoroughly to know if you are getting a bargain. Do your research! Yadav is one of a small handful of places that I found that has great pricing, and the only place of the few that I could go in person to see it with my own eyes.<//Text>

This is a great place! My fiance got my engagement ring from them, and so we wanted to also get our wedding bands at the same location. They were super helpful and responsive to our questions, and were very open to making changes based on our preferences. The end products were gorgeous, and exactly what we asked for!< /Text>

I was hesitant about purchasing a ring online but both me and my fiancé purchased our rings online and it was the best quality you could find anywhere. I had purchased my fiancés ring elsewhere initially but there were a few scratches and the engraving wasn't even so I returned that and went to Yadav and his ring came perfectly! Do not be hesitant at all to order from here as they really do go above and beyond to make sure to provide excellent quality and that you get it in time.< /text>< pictures>

I found a diamond on rarecarat that was sold by another retailer. I had already done my research on the various rarecarat retailers and was convinced Yadav was the best. Rarecarat reached out to Yadav on my behalf and Yadav was able to secure the diamond for less money than the listed retailer. Yadav has been great to work with. Like many reviews I see, I am very picky and had many emails back and forth with many questions. All answered very timely. It is a stressful process to buy such an expensive item sight-unseen, but Yadav minimizes the stress as much as possible. They were willing to send the loose diamond to us for inspection. Yadav (Maytal) then held a zoom meeting with us to view settings.  Maytal had a CAD design created of a custom setting that combined the best features of 2 settings from their website. We are currently in the process of mailing the diamond back for setting. I’m sure it will be beautiful.<//Review>

We were very  impressed  with the way they worked with us to get the perfect ring. My Husband bought me a beautiful new ring for our 40th anniversary and i love it!  If you are concerned about ordering any jewelry online don't be,  At least with Yadav, Because they will help you with any questions and issues you may have to make sure your jewelry is perfect for you.    Thank you so much Yadav you made buying a new diamond ring enjoyable!!< /review>

Found Yadav through RareCarat. To be honest I was a bit skeptical since I've never heard of this jewelry dealer before. However after a couple back and forths, the patience of the staff, and the quality of the packaging and diamond that was received our minds were put to ease!</Review>

I was very worried about buying a ring online without seeing it.

I did a lot of research online about who to buy from and Yadav came out top.

I called and spoke to them and they were incredibly helpful and really put me at ease.

I ordered an engagement ring and it arrived when they said it would. The ring was absolutely beautiful, even better than I could have imagined.

I proposed in Vienna last year with the ring and my girlfriend was over the moon (I think she only said yes because of the ring!). She absolutely loves the ring and so does anyone who sees it.

I have since also bought a wedding ring from Yadav that they recommend to go with the engagement ring.

I cannot day enough good things about them. Do not worry about buying online from them, they are exceptional! I will definitely be going back!<//Text>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>Unfortunately, I lost my original engagement ring. My husband and I spent months looking online for the perfect diamond. When we finally found it on Yadav's website we made an appointment. The staff there were so welcoming. They were prepared to see us. Since the diamond I had my eyes set on were not in their inventory, i had to order it from their website. But, they did show me several diamonds that were comparable so that I had an idea of what mine would look like.

The ordering process was easy since they walked me through it. They told me it would take about 2 weeks to get the diamond and set it, so I was pleasantly surprised when they called me a week later to say that it was ready! I had to work, so my husband was able to pick it up for me. It is absolutely gorgeous!!! Thank you so much to the team at Yadav!!</Text>< Gmap_id>

Excellent 5* experience. I purchased an engagement ring here and Yadav has exceeded my expectations on all levels as I was purchasing sight-unseen. Yadav was on the lower-end price-wise but their quality and service surpasses every other online vendor I've dealt with. I purchased a diamond that looked perfect on paper, but wasn't easy to see in the video they had on it from their distributor. I communicated with the sales rep and she was awesome. She took the time to review the diamond with me and assured me it would look perfect in person (it does). She explained the diamond report and the very strong points it had. I had assistance with every part of the process and it was very comforting. I had concerns with how I wanted the ring to look with prongs and they were able to customize it to my liking. They sent me CAD drawings before it was made and communicated with me on timelines and shipping. The ring came out absolutely gorgeous. Very well made. The only issue I had was that I ordered it too large. I contacted Yadav right after I proposed and they offered me a free resizing upon my first contact and sent me a pre-paid label. Fantastic service, I will certainly buy from Yadav again in the future.<//Text>

I bought the engagement ring for my now wife on Yadav and it was a very smart choice. Excellent service, quality diamonds and my wife loved the ring! After proposing, we had to do a resizing. I was able to ship it back to Yadav and took care of it in timely manner as promised and the process was very effective. Highly recommend this business without doubt.</text>

From start to finish I’ve had an outstanding experience with this company. Their website is an excellent way to shop, sizing, pricing, etc. I purchased the engagement ring and it was amazing. I received a much better price than I had from other retailers. My fiancé was blown away.  Yadav’s customer support was great too. My (now) wife loves the ring so much, we had them custom make her a wedding band to match it. This too was soooooo reasonably priced.  We had an issue w the rings not lining up with each other, no problem. They promptly fixed everything (they paid for shipping back and forth from the east coast) and the customer service was again, excellent, keeping us updated and in the loop - very responsive.

I would 100% use Yadav if I were in the market for an engagement ring.  They have the best pricing I found and their service was exceptional.< /Text>

My fiancé worked with Yadav to design my engagement ring. They helped him pick out the diamond and chose a setting all from a distance. We are in Kansas, they are in California. It’s beyond beautiful! Recommend Yadav hands down. I receive more compliments on my engagement ring than I ever imagined! We will be getting my wedding band from Yadav as well.< /review>

<Review>Had a great experience with Yadav and their team. I had initially selected a stone that did not meet their standards and they felt that I wouldn't be happy with the selection. The team refunded my money and helped me find one that exceeded my expectations. Could not have been happier with their honesty and dedication to ensuring I received exactly what I wanted.</Review></record>

Dealing with this company was amazing from beginning to end.... my wife's ring needed to be resized and they accommodated the process of shipping back, resizing, and sending back at no cost to us.... the diamond was more beautiful than we even expected.... by far the best online service from any online company we have ever experienced.</text>

<Text>The process of picking a ring was so much easier than going to a store. They also have ready made rings for you to choose from or if you have something in mind you can choose a diamond and a style of ring and they can make it for you. The product is delivered promptly and safely. I recommend them if you are having a hard time finding the ring you want.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I bought my wife's engagement ring and most recently a pendant from Yadav. Wife is getting a ton of compliments and could not be happier. Service at Yadav is top tier. Yadav had the pendant shipped overnight and arrived before Christmas. Santa delivered again!<//review>

I was nervous about buying an engagement ring online, sight unseen. But they were so helpful, responsive, and prompt. Even when I had lots of questions because I was so nervous (I was buying the love of my life an engagement ring), they were super patient and answered all my questions. They even offered to expedite the process to get me the ring on a specific day. I’d definitely buy from Yadav again!</Review>

This company far exceeded my expectations. They communicate well and the product was appraised at just a hair under double what I paid for it. I was able to pay in full by wire transfer to recieve an even better price. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase from them every time a diamond is involved.</Review>

After a lot of research, I picked this gorgeous ring for my son's fiancee. I had a wonderful experience picking the diamond and the setting and was very pleased with the service, quality & price. My son's fiancee loves her ring. I will recommend Yadav to all my friends and family who are looking for beautiful jewelry for a great price.<//Review>

I was able to individually select the diamonds of my choice online, going by clarity etc., they were then brought in to the store and I was able to pick which setting and material (white gold) to use. Overall, the process felt more like having a guide with me other than someone just trying to sell to me. I highly recommend them.</Review>< Pics>

<review>Contacted Yadav last November about if they could create a custom engagement ring. Sent them the specs and I got a turnaround time immediately from the jeweler. I also curated the loose diamond from them and the transactions were hassle free when choosing between stones. As I am from Seattle, total time to get my ring was around 4 weeks with sending them back diamonds, receiving new ones, and getting the completed product. Would do business with them again.< /review>< user_id>

My wife is very happy with her new ring and eternity band; I was very apprehensive about such a large spend sight unseen.

Maytal was great to work with throughout the process which included a change from the original setting to the final setting.  I would definitely consider Yadav Diamonds & Jewelry for my next purchase.</Text>

Shopping here was an excellent experience. I was worried about ordering online and not being able to see the diamond and ring in person first, but it arrived looking just how I wanted it. There were no surprises or delays. The recipient of the ring loves it and they get compliments on it all the time.

Thank you for the pleasant experience, Yadav.</Review>

I cannot speak enough superlatives about this company! They saved me money and I got a better diamond and setting than I was originally going tk get from a different company. They were great with communication getting the ring perfected and shipped to me in the time frame I needed it done.  I HIGHLY recommend this company to anyone who is searching for that perfect ring for their perfect someone!<//Text>

My husband got both my engagement and my wedding ring here and at first we were skeptical buying online however, Yadav proved to be a trustworthy, loyal company with a wide array of gorgeous, quality jewelry. I highly recommend them, they have a decent size inventory of all styles, diamonds and metals!</review>

My husband wanted to get me a pair of diamond earrings for Christmas and so we decided to check out Yadav diamonds and jewelry online and I had a question about the diamonds and Yadav emailed back and forth with me and helped me choose the perfect pair of diamonds for my earrings. Once I chose the diamonds and the setting I received my order in a timely manner. I would definitely buy from them again<//Review>

I recently got an engagement ring from Yadav and it was a really great online experience.  I started looking early in the year and COVID hit.  I mentioned the time frame I was looking and felt no "salesman" like pressure from them.  Always a plus to not feel rushed or forced.

Once I was finally ready to purchase I did it fully online.  I will say my one disappointment is some of the sets won't be able to show different gem shapes.  For example I got the tessa set w/  a heart, but you could only view it with a circle.  Nevertheless it came out great.

I also picked Yadav because based on value they appear to have the best diamond pricing for lab created diamonds in my research.

Good luck to anyone else out there looking.</Text>

I enjoyed the level of service I received from Yadav. I ordered a loose diamond and had them craft a setting and band to match it. They were really nice and prompt. The value was amazing. The ring turned out perfect. I will be a returning customer for sure. Thanks.<//Text>

Couldn't be any happier with my custom engagement ring from Yadav. The staff was kind and informative and the final product exceeded all expectations. My fiance gets random compliments on a near-daily basis. I know the search is tough gentlemen, do yourself a favor and go with Yadav.</Review>

With their help both online and over the phone, I was able to select the perfect center diamond given our specifications and budget. We also wanted a custom ring that included accent diamonds that belonged to our family. I was able to send Yadav the family stones with no trouble. Yadav was then able to build the ring given reference photos of another ring design we liked. The ring turned out exactly as we wanted, and all in a very short time frame.

All in all, wonderful experience. Thank you Yadav for this ring we will cherish forever.</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPruYxDtrZmONb4RsuYPfXl_kK4pyEQdFwN7Og=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< resp>

At first I was somewhat skeptical about purchasing a diamond and setting online however Yadav's  good reviews and rather broad selection of diamonds kept me intrigued. I felt more comfortable after talking to one of Yadav's gemologist, Sheila, who answered all of my questions and guided my fiancé and I in choosing a beautiful diamond and setting and even insurance. Yadav's pricing also seemed very competitive compared to other online retailers. To save some money I did end up purchasing our diamond via wire transfer. I would recommend sending a follow-up email to Yadav's office after you initiate the transfer. As a further improvement to Yadav's website I would suggest uploading more zoomed out videos of each diamond however I understand this may not be logistically realistic. Overall everything came out great and should I need to purchase jewelry or a diamond again Yadav would be on the top of my list.</Review>

<review>I am so pleased with my buying experience at Yadav Jewelry. I encountered a mixup initially because the billing address on the credit card I used was different from the shipping address. Yadav was very responsive through email and phone and was able to carry out my order. I am so pleased with the final product, the ring is beautiful. Thank you Yadav for the excellent service and product.<//review>< pictures>

< Review>
I was extremely impressed with my experience buying an engagement ring from Yadav. I initially emailed back and forth with Maytal to set up an appointment for viewing several stone sizes in various settings. After that first appointment, I went home and selected a few stones from their website inventory so that I could view them in-person. The entire staff was extremely accommodating with my requests and they had the stones shipped to the store so that I could directly compare them during my 2nd in-store visit. I chose the stone that I liked the best, paid, and the ring was ready for pickup in a few days. It is absolutely beautiful and my fiancé loves it. Yadav's showroom isn't huge, but the customer service is top-notch and the prices and selection are absolutely fantastic. I highly recommend Yadav for anyone that wants to hand-pick their diamond(s) for engagement rings or any other jewelry.< /Review>

When the ring size didn’t fit, I shipped it back for free and it was resized and back on my fiancé’s hand within a few days. Thank you!<//Text>< Rating>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>With so many options when it comes to buying an engagement ring, things can get a little confusing! Yadav made the process so easy. I looked at many different online-only vendors but Yadav has the best pricing by far which surprised me since they have a store in San Francisco. I had previously visited their showroom and experienced very friendly service which helped me make the decision to choose Yadav. I then purchased the ring online a few months later and had a fantastic experience with Nan and Layla. They provide a 3D rendering of the ring for your review and shipped via FedEx overnight.

The ring is absolutely stunning! I highly recommend Yadav to anyone looking to purchase an engagement ring either in-person or online.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

I went shopping and I stumbled on Yadav. At first I was very skeptical on ordering online, but during two business trips, I decided to visit their center and they have a lot of selections and very nice people to help. I finally made the decision to purchase a ring from Yadav for my wife to celebrate our 15 year anniversary. The got a really great deal and the ring looks beautiful. I would absolutely shop here again.< /Review>

After having done hours of online research regarding all aspects of buying a diamond, purchasing through Yadav couldn’t have been a better decision. The ring is exactly what I wanted, a great deal, shipped promptly, and the buying experience was seamless. I can’t recommend Yadav enough.</Text>

Enjoyed our experience with Yadav very much. Despite COVID and the city of San Fran making it very difficult for business owners to decide if they can operate safely, Yadav got our ring made and shipped out asap. So happy we chose them --- may take advantage of the diamond upgrade lifetime someday!< /text>

I wanted to create an engagement ring for my partner, and we both agreed to look for a lab diamond. I found Yadav online, and bought a lab diamond online. The website was easy to navigate, and the diamond was beautiful. We wanted to visit the shop in person, but don't live in the area - otherwise we probably also would've gotten the band from there also.<//review>

<text>Got great advice from Jim on the phone, as well as several other members. It took a couple weeks to get here, but the price was excellent and the ring is stunning. Fiancé loves it. Definitely was apprehensive buying something so expensive online, but I’m glad I did. 10/10 recommend. Will be going back there soon to get her a wedding band.< /text>< Rating>

Placed an order yesterday, had the confirmation, told the seller to call me this morning to set up payments and the seller said ok. I have to contact the seller again in the afternoon because no one called.
Then the seller told me the stone was gone even I place the order and had  the confirmation.

FYI, not to complain, the seller said they will give me a $25 off coupon on a $6.6k ring.<//review>

<Review>We have been married for twenty years and were looking for a new diamond in a new setting and couldn’t be happier that we chose Yadav! Their customer service, knowledge and ease of making this purchase was simple without any pressure. The old ring/setting was less than a carat, so we upgraded to a 2.4 ct. cushion cut diamond in a halo with a split-shank setting. Their prices allowed us to get the upgrade we were hoping for without breaking our budget. The purchase comes with complete GIA appraisal paperwork too. Jim the owner, and Sumi were beyond helpful, so our decision making was easy! Twenty years later, we are happy newlyweds again!

Without hesitation, we’ll recommend Yadav!

Words cannot explain how grateful and how happy I am with my ring, thanks to Yadav's team and most importantly, the owner's daughter Maytal. She was very accommodating and would even respond to my e-mails late at night. My engagement ring was purchased from a different company and after changing the setting 3 times, they simply cannot bring my vision to life. So after a few researches and comparing prices with two other jewelers, I trusted Yadav to custom make the setting for me. This family owned business deserves all the credit and praise for their very personable way of working with clients and their unbeatable price. They gave me my dream ring!<//text>

<review>Yadav was probably the best diamond buying experience I could have had. I worked with Maytal who helped me source the perfect diamond for my fiancé’s engagement ring. I don’t think anyone could have beat their price for the diamond I purchased from them and the experience was so great I recommended them to my cousin who also got an exceptional E-ring from them.<//review>< pictures>

<rating>5<//rating><review>I'll admit, I was a little nervous at first about buying a diamond I've never seen before but the pictures and videos online made it look perfect at less than half the price of my local jewelry stores.  Yadav didn't disappoint and I felt safe with their return policy.  The diamond was better than I expected and packaged perfectly.  I bought a loose diamond so I could have it set in a specific ring for sentimental reasons and Yadav crushed the competition.  The shipping was fast, I had tracking all along the way, and the customer service was helpful every time I called with questions.  I'll be going back to them for all my jewelry needs.<//review>< pics>

My first impression with Yadav diamonds is truly outstanding. Their team shared all details of diamond I was interested on ( ASET/IDEAL scope pics) that not many would have/share . I had bought my Diamond online from them . I searched all of NY diamond district before making decision to with Yadav. Their customer service is super responsive and patient to understand the needs of customer . My diamond came out so very beautiful! Thank you Yadav team . I am hooked to them for rest of my diamond purchases ! And they do have best prices in USA and excellent refund policy ( no questions asked ) . All in all excellent courteous  people to deal for any Diamonds purchases!
Btw I found them through Rarecarat!<//text>

My ring is so Beautiful and Perfect. Sheila made our experience customizing my ring so easy! Yadav went above and beyond to support my now fiancé with picking the perfect diamond during quarantine/lockdowns and not being able to visit the showroom. My fiancé and I plan on going through Yadav for any other custom jewelry we plan on getting. :)<//Review>

I did an absurd amount of research on diamonds in general trying to find the most ideal stone but with reasonable cost in mind. I ended up purchasing a loose lab-grown diamond and it is an absolutely gorgeous stone. I got the appraisal done and was happy with that as well. The diamond was delivered with UPS secured signature-only service in a beautifully adorned box. Overall, I found that for the quality to price ratio using my criteria and standards was best through Yadav.< /review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>I rarely post reviews but working with Yadav Diamonds & Jewelry was an exceptional experience that I'd like to share.  I had lost a diamond earring and wanted to replace it - a sad experience and not particularly an easy task.  Maytal was fabulous to work with - she is knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly but never pushy.  She was patient while I took some time to research options and decide what I wanted to do, and was ready to help at a moment's notice.  Once I made my decision she worked with me and helped with my selection.  I also requested a specific type of earring back that they do not normally carry on their website, and I wasn't sure if Yadav would be able to accommodate my request.  Maytal quickly sourced it for me to make it happen.  Her efficient handling of several shipments back and forth, together with her very pleasant demeanor, ensured that I felt comfortable and confident at each step.  I am extremely happy with the end result and the entire process.  I would gladly work with Yadav again and am happy to recommend them.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x808f7e2c76ec340f:0x828e09b5c38cbe2d<//gmapID></record>

<Text>I had the pleasure of buying my fiancé’s engagement ring from Yadav and couldn’t be happier with it. Their attention to detail and flexibility was invaluable to me throughout the process.

Before purchasing, I researched other jewelers thoroughly. I met with a few very well known jewelers in NYC, but none gave me the sense of security that I received from Yadav.

Once I received the final product, I was blown away. My fiancé loved it and so did everyone who saw it.

Unfortunately, my fiancé lost it one day at the beach, but Yadav and their amazing insurance company, Zillion, had my back.

See, Yadav allows you to purchase insurance when you check out making the process smooth and effortless. This is something I probably would’ve skipped had I went with one of those hot shots on 5th Avenue.

Luckily, we were covered and the insurance company worked with Yadav to replace the engagement ring. The appraisal allowed for some room to upgrade, so Yadav and Zillion was able to accommodate a lager, clearer, more beautiful diamond, upgrade from white gold to platinum as well as a matching platinum band.

It is with great pleasure that I recommend Yadav to anyone looking for fine jewelry. Layla is amazing and was such a pleasure to work with. I’ve recommended at least two close friends already and will continue to do so as my close friends make their proposals.

Sincerely,

<text>I had a phenomenal experience shopping at Yadav. I picked out a diamond and setting online from their website. The jewelers who I talked with on the phone were very knowledgable and responsive to all of my questions and concerns.

I ended up selecting a 1.78 carat G VS1 Triple X, no fluorescence Diamond with a white gold pavé band. In person, the ring turned is even more beautiful than expected! It is truly stunning.

My only wish is that such a gorgeous ring came in a box worthy to hold it. I found that the ring box from Yadav looked a bit too cheap for such a beautiful diamond - it seems as if it is made of cardboard. This is a small nitpick though - don't let it stop you from shopping at Yadav! I would recommend this store in a heartbeat.</text>< Pictures>

<Text>Extremely pleased with the engagement ring buying experience we had thru Yadav.  We bought two different diamonds (fiancee changed her mind on the first one) and the return process was easy and hassle free with our full money back.  I shopped around online quite a bit and consistently found that Yadav had best prices available for comparable diamonds at other retailers (along with fast delivery).  Once we settled on a second diamond, Yadav also designed the setting itself based on my fiancee's exact specifications and it came out perfectly.  She is very happy with the ring, and would definitely use them again for future jewelry purchases.  Maytal in particular was our contact through the process and she was very helpful, friendly and responsive throughout.  Thanks Yadav!<//Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

As an international buyer who bought online I Would recommend Yadav for buying diamonds or jewelry 1000%. The online process was simple and their staff was easy to reach with all my concerns and questions. Delivery was extremely fast and made my purchase much less nerve wracking.
My diamond is absolutely incredible!! Pictures don’t do it justice. I researched every online buying option and they offered the best value I could find anywhere in Canada & US.
Thank you so much for making this purchase seamless and comfortable.
My only suggestion would have been to provide advice on how the customs was going to work along with the tracking confirmation but I managed to sort it out easily enough along with your excellent staff!!<//Text>

<review>We were initially hesitant to order an engagement ring online but Yadav made the experience seamless! My ring is more beautiful than I could have imagined and they worked so quickly to create the ring and get it to us, despite a pandemic! Layla was always quick to respond and so patient with my many questions and made sure I found exactly what I was looking for. Thank you Yadav!! For anyone in need of an engagement ring, I strongly encourage using this company!< /review>< pictures>

She has no interest or knowledge about diamonds or their availability. She was busy texting her boyfriend/girlfriend while we were waiting for her to respond. We had to repeat ourselves as she was not paying attention. Yadav, owner of the store literally asked us to leave because they were closing the store, why didn’t they even schedule an appoint 10minutes after they closed the store. We drove an hour to get there and our trip was of no use.
Worst experience and would never return.</Text>< Pics>

<review>I had a wonderful experience and I highly recommend Yadav Jewelry! I ordered a beautiful diamond online and it turned out that it had already been sold. I was contacted immediately and was offered a slightly larger diamond that was the exact same quality, for the same price. I was very impressed with their customer service and communication. The presentation box that the diamond arrived in was excellent!!!< /review>< user_name>

I must have been the typical over anxious fiance to be, as I went to see Jim at Yadav Jewelry like five times before I purchased the ring of my choice. I also went back and forth changing the ring size three times, making sure it was the correct fit before the surprise proposal. Amazingly, no matter how bothersome I felt I was being, the staff at Yadav Jewelry was always so helpful and attentive to my wishes. Just an amazing experience and luckily for me she said "Yes"!< /Review>

Making one of the most expensive purchases you will make, online, can be nothing short of nerve wracking. However, their partnership with rarecarat.com, their ever present, courteous and knowledgeable associates, make it a very well educated decision. Even for novices. Would highly recommend them - start because of their prices and variety, buy because of their knowledge and courtesy.<//text>

<Name>Daniel Lynch< /Name><Date>1602965962116< /Date><Text>I purchased the McKinley Ring which turned out beautiful and my fiancé loved. Yadav made the ring and mounted the diamond in about two weeks and I received the ring in well under three weeks. The only problem was the 30 day resized deadline. I didn't propose until a two weeks after I received the ring while I waited for the correct time. The ring was just slightly too big for my fiancés finger but it took a week for two for her to determine that and by then it was pasted the 30 day resize limit.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Couldn’t be happier with my experience at Yadav.

I went here for my engagement ring for my wife. They were able to custom make a design I liked from another jeweler and it was absolutely perfect. We also ended up getting our wedding bands here as well.

They also have great perks that other jewelers can’t consistently match — lifetime resizing and polishing, diamond exchanges at original purchase price, etc.

Highly recommend Yadav to anyone looking for great rings and service.<//text>

<review>Great service, prices, and customer service. I ordered some diamonds to go with a ring. I received them and they did not look how I wanted them to. I had to get a return for them. The process for that was easy. They did not give me a hard time about returning them and I was credited very quickly. I ended up ordering another diamond and it was shipped as stated and there were no issues. I would highly recommend them.<//review><date>1583361822163</date><pics>None</pics>< UserId.>

After a few months of looking at several local jewelers in the Philadelphia area, I decided to purchase a loose diamond from Yadav. I initially put the stone I was interested in buying in my cart online but didn't complete.  Amelie from their customer service reached out to see if I had questions and also offered a $250 discount. I made the purchase and it was delivered via Fedex in a very nice box and small display case.  The diamond is beautiful and my now fiance loves it. The jeweler who set it said it was a great stone and it was very reasonably priced compared to local jewelers who wanted much higher amounts for lower quality diamonds.</review>

Jim is the best! I am so excited to get the diamond in the mail. He is an expert, and compared to other diamond retailers is prices are considerably better. He was so patient with me throughout the process. I strongly advise you to look her before any other site like Blue Nile or James Allen. I spent dozens of hours researching to find the right diamond. Not only was the price better, but there was no tax! Yadav Diamonds is the best out there!< /Text>

I ordered an engagement ring from Yadav and had an excellent experience.  I ordered a 2.22 carat stone with a platinum setting.  Based on my extensive research of the all of the online jewelers, such as James Allen and Blue Nile, I felt Yadav offered a much larger and attractive selection of settings. I was nervous making such a large purchase online, but it all worked out great in the end.  Upon receiving the ring, I took it to a local jeweler to verify it was authentic.  It was the real deal and the jeweler commented on the excellent quality of main stone.  I missed the mark on the ring size on the initial order and we had to send it back a few times to get the size perfect.  Yadav made it easy with prepaid FedEx shipping labels.  They were always gracious about it and never make us feel like it was an inconvenience.  Overall, I feel like we received an excellent price and a quality engagement ring.  In the big picture the temporary sizing issues was well worth the money I saved versus going to a local big named jewelry store.  I can’t imagine what a local jewelry store would have charged me for a similar ring, but suspect at least 40% more based upon my research.<//Text>

<Review>My experience dealing with Yadav was amazing. I was hesitant to order a diamond online. However, they reached out right away and gave me the peace of mind I needed. I decided to pick up the diamond at their store and that, once again, was a really pleasant experience. The lady that helped me was so nice, and I never felt rushed. They showed me the diamond and I was able to see the GIA inscription. Overall, great customer service!< /Review>< username>

<text>After going to multiple brick and morter stores and many places online, my (now) wife and I ultimately purchased from Yadav based on their designs and their prices.  We were so satisfied with our purchase that we came back for the wedding band.
If you are considering Yadav, make sure you talk with customer service. the engagement ring we purchased didnt have an advised matching wedding band, but when we talked to CS, they let us know they actually did have one, it just wasn't on the website.< /text>< pics>

<text>Jim and the whole team at Yadav were amazing to work with!

I had missed the delivery and wanted to pick up the packege at a UPS Customer Service Center instead of waiting for them to attempt a second delivery and the team at Yadav worked very quickly to make it possible.

The engagement ring was even more gorgeous in person than expected, would highly recommend them for all your jewelry needs.

Thank You Yadav Jewelry!<//text>< user_id>

<text>So 5 stars is not enough. I ordered an engagement ring and when I got it I noticed some fluorescence.  Beautiful ring but in bright sunlight it had a slight hint of blue. I called up Yadav and they were very understanding, they told me to send the ring back and order a new diamond of my liking. I was pressed for time and they got me the new diamond in my previously selected setting. The ring is simply gorgeous. A+ customer care A+ speed A+ price A+ quality. Btw all my orders were done online and never went to showroom. Very pleased and will always recommend them.  Also my fiancé wants to buy diamond studs and tennis bracelet from here too.  Thanks Yadav. Lol.  Ha.<//text>< pictures>

He carefully and thoughtfully listened to exactly what I was looking for and treated me like family with every interaction. The stone arrived and it was exactly what I was looking for! I could not have had a more professional and enjoyable buying experience. I am looking forward to flying from Southern California up to San Francisco to personally thank Jim and all of the Yadav team in the near future. I’d recommend doing business with them to all of my friends and family. They do not disappoint!!< /Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

I was very thorough when looking at Yadav's website, as I am sure most people are when looking to make one of the biggest purchases of their life. The team's communication was great, they were willing to send actual pictures of the stones/bands I was interested in, and were truly concerned with my experience. I would highly recommend buying from Yadav.<//text>

<Text>First time jewelry buyer and shopping for an engagement ring. Shopped around all the sites and did my research and kept circling back to yadav. Not only did they have the best pricing but they responded to all my million emails and helped me out a ton. I needed up purchasing an engagement ring and it looks amazing. Great experience and made a scary task enjoyable. Everything is perfect and looks amazing & the lady loves it too! Thanks a ton.< /Text>< pics>

Ordered an engagement ring spent over $3000 on it only to be told a couple days later that it was already sold. Now I have to wait to get my money back before I can try to find another.</Review>

I purchased my a diamond engagement ring from them and returned it to get a bigger diamond.  Both transactions went smoothly and I couldn't be happier with the price and service!  Before you buy a diamond make sure you price Yadav and save money.< /Text>

About a year ago, I bought an engagement ring from Yadav. I did quite a bit of searching using diamond search engines, website searches and local shopping. After all of my searching, I finally went with Yadav. My initial reason for choosing them was the diamond price, but then I quickly realized they had a huge selection of very elegant and high quality rings to go with the stone that I chose. I put the diamond and setting together and made the request to buy. As great as their pricing was their customer service. It seems like from my first click they were on it. Immediate responses, answers to questions and impeccable friendliness and service. This really made me feel good about my choice and took all the complication and concern out of the sale. This was a once in a lifetime purchase and feel really great it was with Yadav. Some diamond studs may soon be in the forecast; I’ll definitely be back on their site shopping before any other. Thanks Yadav, you were great!</Text>

<Text>The buying process was simple and uncomplicated but the final ring seemed slightly different from the photos online. The setting that we purchased is called the Hanna. The center stone is a 2 carat cushion which was ours already so we only purchased the setting from Yadav. It’s definitely pretty but it’s just a bit smaller and it seems less large than the photos online. If we’d had more time I probably would’ve returned it but we didn’t. It’s still a lovely ring, it’s just not totally like the online photos. Specifically, in the setting online, we couldn’t see the dots of platinum that are holding in the halo and band diamonds.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><user_id>113775744038966692122<//user_id>< name>

My expectations were far exceeded by Yadav. I put together a stunning engagement ring with a high quality stone at an excellent price. Even the box was a pleasant surprise. My now fiancé was thrilled with the selection. I spent several weeks going through their large inventory of center stones. Nan in customer service answered all of my detailed questions with detailed answers. (I am a very particular person.) She eventually suggested the perfect stone based on my specifications. Maytal went to great lengths to assure my order arrived on time (during COVID). If you are ring shopping, I suggest educating yourself on diamonds and then work with Yadav. I would definitely purchase from them again.< /Text>

<text>Update: Added 2 star delivery came in the tail end of window packaged very very well. Communication was pretty lacking and created a bit of uncertainty and doubt on my end so no 4 or 5 star rating from me. Others seem to have solid customer service based on reviews but was pretty average on my end, felt just like ordering a simple item off amazon just a longer delivery process.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

My fiancé bought my engagement ring online through Yadav and I absolutely love it!  After the proposal he told me all the details of the buying process and that it was fantastic.  I was very particular with what I wanted in a diamond, so originally he felt more comfortable going to a store.  So, he made appointments and visited stores here in NC, but wasn't seeing what he wanted at the price point where he wanted to be.  We found the site through Rare Carat; he said that by far Yadav has the best prices, and any worry with buying a ring online went away with their 30 day return policy.  My ring is stunning, and Yadav was there when my he had questions or needed help during the buying process.  He said if given the choice to do it over, he would 100% got back to Yadav.< /Text>

Found a great diamond on another site that was also listed on Yadav for less!  Great customer service!  I would recommend Yadav to anyone and will use them again in the future!  A++<//text>

My son ordered a ring online which can be quite scary, however, as soon as the ring arrived, we had a big sigh of relief! WHAT A DIAMOND! This ring shines incredible and you will absolutely not find a better price at any jewelry store whether online or in your local home town store. I researched for months and months with son to find the perfect ring and no store was able to beat Yadav's prices and the quality. Don't even waste time hunting on the internet. This place IS THE BOMB!!! My son's girlfriend was so thrilled with her ring.
Thank you Yadav for making my son and his girlfriend so very happy.< /text>

<Text>After much research and analysis my wife and I  flew to San Francisco and purchased a Beautiful wedding ring . The staff at Yadav could not be more polite, professional and transparent. It has been the best Jewelry and Diamond buying experience I have ever had and I would highly recommend them to buy any loose Diamond, Lab or Natural , simply the most extensive selection at the best prices with incredible quality standards and incredible level of Assurance and transparency.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

My lady couldn't have been happier with the ring. I was skeptical to buy a ring without seeing it first in person, but Amelia eased all of my concerns. Ultimately, we couldn't be happier with the diamond or the process.<//review>

I purchased a diamond online because i was frustrated with the lack of selection in stores in Atlanta. Yadav had a very nice website that allowed me to shop and see the quality of diamonds online. I ordered a beautiful Loose diamond. Customer service was great, shipping was fast, and the packaging was excellent.. and very good quality. I am very happy i found Yadav. Highly recommend.</text>

I was clueless about what/ how to start my research for the diamond, a friend recommended Yadav Jewelry to me. I was overwhelmed by many options they had on their website, so I called their customer service for help.  I was greeted by Christy who was very patient and knowledgeable. She walked me through their website filter to help me find a good quality diamond within my budget.

She gave me lots of ideas such as what shape are the most popular and which setting is stronger. She also told me to pay attention on clarity and fluorescence and explain why they are important factors to choose a diamond.  *Since I really had ZERO knowledge about diamond, this conversation helped a lot! :-)

When I picked up the ring at Yadav store, I couldn’t have been happier to see the ring. It was just what I wanted – a simple and elegant ring for my mom. It was a very pleasant and seamless experience.

Thank you for the excellent service. My mom loves it!</review><username>Weian Wei< /username>< userid>

<Review>I ordered my ring in the middle of the Corona Crisis. Customs was shut down so my ring got stuck. I was super nervous about getting it in time for the engagement but the customer service team always responded same day even after hours. They asked me when my engagement was and were prepared to move mountains to make sure the ring got there on time. It did! And she said Yes :)<//Review>< date>

<Text>For our 6 year anniversary my husband upgraded my stone.  We purchased our wedding ring from Yadav and the price was right so we came back and we were not disappointed.  We have a stunning custom ring with a one of a kind stone.  The price was highly competitive and communication was constant. This helped us locate and purchase the best stone in the range we wanted  The design team is top notch and fast.  We are very happy with the owner- he  does his best to make things happen for you and on your timeline.

Terrible service. Would not price match diamonds with the exact same IGI number listed at another retailer. Yadav pricing was almost 30% higher than their competitors but when asked about their written price match guarantee all they would offer was $200 which was a complete joke. When questioned about their policy they stopped replying to all communication.<//review>

<rating>5</rating><response>None< /response><Text>I was referred to this company from a colleague for their high quality and good work.  I spoke with the reps one-on-one and online chat; they were very helpful and knowledgeable.  I inquired about what type of metal my ring should be made of. They listened to my needs and suggested the right metal (14K white gold in my case).  It was an opportunity to "up-sell" me by putting me in a platinum or 18K white gold...but they didn't. After MUCH research, I finally made the purchase from them. It is crafted beautifully and the quality is just as described.  It is really a stunning piece of jewelry. Turn time was accurate and delivered as promised.
It arrived very well protected and came packaged in a very nice quality box and outer shell. The certificate and purchase information was all packaged very neatly as well. Overall a perfect online purchase.  I would order again in a heartbeat.  Most importantly, my bride of over 20 years is THRILLED with the ring!  If you're looking for a way to tell her you'd do it all over again...I highly recommend, no hesitation!<//Text>< gmap_id>

<Review>I found Yadav Diamonds & Jewelry on many online diamond sites, RareCarat in particular. They were very highly recommended, so I felt okay dealing with them over the phone/online. I had a fast turnaround time, 4 days to be exact, to get a diamond for an engagement ring I had designed for my fiancé, so I gave them a call.

The initial person I worked with told me the diamond I selected online wouldn’t arrive on time, so he sent me some options matching my specs and had me review and make my decision by the next business day. Once I finally selected my diamond, I worked closely with Maytal to make sure everything went as planned. She was awesome. As expected, the diamond arrived on time and was packaged perfectly. It was amazing and just as wonderful as I could have imagined. The GIA certification was included, as well as some other documentation.

Overall, my experience was great and I highly recommend using Yadav. The prices are reasonable and the service is awesome. I hope to one day purchase more jewelry from here!

Thanks again,
Ryan</Review></record>

Bought sight unseen which astonished all my friends. I’m from NY, so when I tried to wire the money, my bank got nervous with such a large sum. I trusted my gut and bought it. It’s exactly what I paid for. I did get a new setting for it, and was glad to hear from the jeweler here that I had indeed done well for my money.   I plan on upgrading in a few years and definitely will use them again.  Thanks for a beautiful diamond.< /review>

<Text>Yadav's great website, service, overall shopping experience, and, most of all, the excellent craftsmanship of the engagement ring itself was everything I could've asked for. Honestly, it came out much more impressive than I expected. After finding them via Rarecarat on a Facebook ad, I was impressed by the ease of use and wide selection of the website. The friendliness and helpfulness they showed me via e-mail and over the phone (Sumi) throughout this process has been exceptional and sincerely appreciated. When I finally did place the order, it arrived exactly on the day promised -- packaged surprisingly elegantly. I was a bit apprehensive about spending a boatload of money on the internet on something sight unseen that I have little experience with such as jewelry, but they made the whole experience just that much less painful.<//Text>< pics>

<Review>I was so glad a friend of mine recommended this place! He told me how he looked for a year for the right place, including wholesalers, and couldn't recommend anything other than Yadav.  After searching myself before that tip, I have to agree.  The quality of this place is incredible, and without the markup for high-end jewelry.

Both my friend and I were able to get an engagement ring custom-made, and still at prices far better than other jewelers, even wholesalers.  Besides the price, and getting the perfect ring that didn't seem possible elsewhere, Yadav is just a knowledgeable, friendly, and honest person.< /Review>< Pictures>

When I was looking for a lab grown engagement  ring for my now Fiancé, I kept crossing paths with Yadav. Finding the right ring is not an easy task... at all but Yadav made it super easy! But the best part was the customer service I received afterwards! You see, I chose the wrong size (not my fault! She lost a lot of weight since we last “looked” at rings) so when I needed to return it they made it super easy! Sent me instructions to my email and shipping tags! A couple of weeks later it was sized to the correct size! My Fiancé and I absolutely love the ring and Yadav’s customer service!</text>

I searched all over the internet for the perfect diamond engagement ring, and ultimately, Yadav had a fantastic deal on a beautiful diamond and a perfect setting for it. The ring came out beautifully and my fiancée absolutely loves it. They also have great customer service. Couldn’t be happier with my purchase!<//Text>

This review is specifically for the online side of Yadav.

BUY WITH CONFIDENCE. Amazing. Absolutely incredible. You will be warned by all your local jewelers not to buy a stone online- that seeing it in person is the ONLY way to know if it's a good stone.

I will personally vouch for Yadav. The stones they advertise come in at 40% cheaper than a comparable stone (on paper) as from a local jeweler. I took the stone I purchased to that local jeweler who repeatedly told me I would regret buying online. They put it through every inspection they could think of to try and show that I could have done better buying the stone locally, but in the end all they could do was shrug and tell me what a beautiful stone I got at such an incredible price.

They sell a superior product for a better price. They stand behind it. They take care of their customers. BUY WITH CONFIDENCE. You won't regret it.</text>

<review>I purchased some jewelry through Yadav with a custom selected stone. It was easy, very smooth process. There was some miscommunication with whatever company actually had the stone, first they said it wasn't available, then it was, then it wasn't. No fault on the part of Yadav. They were in contact with me the whole time and sent me alternative stones. The owner himself even called me to explain what the mix-up was with the seller. I ended up cancelling the order and they had my money refunded within 24 hours. The owner again called me to apologize after. I would absolutely try and buy from them again. Their customer service was one of the best I'd ever seen.<//review><Rate>5< /Rate>< name>

My now fiancé was adamant about finding the most PERFECT diamond. It took him a few months looking for my diamond at a reasonable price. He found Yadav on Rarecarat after searching for the specs he wanted. When I looked myself, I saw yadav had plenty of choices when it came to diamonds. Yadav made ring shopping easier as they already had a variety of setting to choose from. Anyways, I could not be happier with my ring. My fiancé did an amazing job picking out my diamond and setting. I told him I wanted a matching wedding ring too. My fiancé is so proud of himself because he catches me staring at my ring all the time. He is happy that I’m happy with my ring. We also liked that Yadav had choices on what type of metal to use for the setting. I’ve had my ring for almost two months. The ring is very comfortable and the diamonds glisten so much. It’s blinding!!! We are so happy with Yadav. As far as communication, my fiancé had no problem reaching out to them, as we did live in Los Angeles. Thank you Yadav!</review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>GO TO JAMES ALLEN. My fiance got my original engagement ring from here. At first I was in love but then we quickly started to realize that my band had tons of imperfections. We contacted Yadav and they paid for the shipping back. We received the ring back after about a week and it still had  several imperfections on the band. Yadav said they would send us a new band to inspect and if we liked that one better then we could ship the band and the ring back to switch the diamond. Well, we thought wow great customer service until when we received the new band it was a COMPLETELY different one. So, we then asked for a full refund because at this point this had been going on for a month. They were very professional about the refund. We then went to James Allen. It was AMAZING. My new ring has 0 imperfections and they honestly had better prices.<//Review>< Pictures>

Amazing Experience!

They have a huge selection of diamonds to fit your need and very good prices.

I bought by fiance's engagement ring online and have told all of my friends to do the same when they decide to pop the question.</Review>

I purchased a GIA certified diamond online from Yadav and it was a fantastic experience.  They had the best price online by far.  When the diamond arrived, I took it to a friend of mine who works at a jeweler.  He said that I paid what they would've paid for it, without the markup.

I highly recommend Yadav.  They're selling high quality diamonds at an incredibly honest price!<//Review>

The website was super easy to use and we really loved how we could choose the diamond and setting. The process was easy and the price was fantastic. The ring looked wonderful online and it's 100 times better in person. I had a question about the diamond after the order and was met with an immediate answer that was helpful and very polite. The only bad thing is I don't have more business to give them. I wish they were someone that I had to business with all the time because it was a pleasure. Buy with confidence. The jewelry is very high quality, anyone claiming otherwise is a fool.<//Text>

Read this is you want an honest review... These guys are legit. Pricing is great and shipping was dead on. I was a little worried about ordering diamonds on line. It's a lot of money to spend and not get what you ordered. Everything arrived as stated and we were in constant communication the whole time via email. I will definitely use them in the future for my diamond needs and highly suggest them to anyone.</Text>

5 stars are not enough! This people are real professionals and they will give you more than you want! The engagement ring I've both is more than gorgeous!
I am from Bulgaria and here the people are skeptic about buying from the internet. Especially when it comes to a diamond ring!! I've decide to trust Yadav team and to put in their hands my engagement. And I was not disappointed - extremely beautiful ring, with BIG and beautiful diamond - and this for 1/5 of the price in Bulgaria!
Again recommended with two hands! Do not hesitate to trust Yadav and buy your precious one ring from here!!!< /Text>

I was thrilled about the service from Jim and team at Yadav Jewelry! At first, I was a little skeptical about making such a purchase online, but after building up confidence with multiple phone calls to the store, I did not regret my decision. The ring setting is gorgeous, and the diamond itself is absolutely stunning. Not only does my fiance love it, but everyone she has shown it to is very impressed and complimentary. 10/10. I would buy from yadav again!<//Review>

Bought engagement ring from Yadav. Super easy to find the right ring and customer service is top notch. Had time constraints on the delivery and they overnighted the ring to me for no charge. Also had to have the ring re-sized and again, no problems. They emailed me the shipping label and all we had to do was package it well and send it off. Came back within a week with notifications along the way. Great company to work with.<//Review>

I ordered my fiancée’s ring from Yadav online. The ring arrived right on-time in secure packaging with every last document included. When we found the ring to be slightly too big, Yadav handled all the shipping back and forth to ensure the ring was perfect. She loves the ring and that means everything to me! Thank you Yadav; you guys are a class act.<//Review>

I have to admit I was a little worried about the wait but it was worth every second. This is a true diamond dealer not some generic mark up jeweler taking advantage of "super ideal" B.S. They sent me the EXACT GIA certified diamond I paid for not some lower cut substitute. The diamond I purchased scored a 9.5 on the HCA calculator & I paid triple EX price I feel like I stole the damn diamond. I'll wait the two weeks & continue business with Yadav Diamonds as long as these prices stay honest.< /Text>

<text>I would recommend Yadav to absolutely anyone. My (now) fiancee' and I did some browsing at a few local shops to get an idea of what she wanted. Knowing that I could find better pricing online, I found Jim's showroom in San Francisco through Rare Carat. Jim had some of the best prices I could find and I decided to go in for a visit.

I provided Jim w/ a very specific list of what I was looking for and he brought in multiple diamonds he thought would make sense. Although I ultimately decided to buy a diamond online through his website, Jim stayed very involved throughout the process and didn't hesitate to give me HONEST feedback about the options that I picked out, all the while giving off 0% pressure about making a purchase.

The diamond I picked out shipped to the showroom within a few days and I came in for a 2nd visit to view it, pick out the perfect setting, and waited a couple hours for the jeweler to finish the ring. I couldn't have asked for a better experience and definitely plan to take my soon-to-be wife back for her wedding band.

Jim is phenomenal and Layla, his customer service do-it-all gal, provided exceptional & extremely responsive customer service along the way. Thanks again to the whole crew at Yadav, things couldn't have gone better!<//text><Time>1486983158108<//Time>< UserId.>

Jim is the best jeweler alive!  He is incredibly knowledgeable and helpful.  My fiance purchased my engagement ring from Jim and he and Layla have been so helpful in finding a matching band for myself and a wedding band for our upcoming wedding.  The customer service at Yadav's is truly something to experience, right from selecting a stone to actually receiving a finished product.  The best part is that Jim is so accommodating in terms of one's preference; making it truly a unique experience! Must check him out for yourself!<//review>

<Text>I don't often write reviews, and will usually delete the emails asking that I do, but Yadav (via rarecarat) is awesome.  The ring I got through them was brilliant and affordable relative to the brick and mortar retail environment.

It was slightly too big so we had to send it back for resizing (free).  We live on the East Coast, Yadav is on the West Coast.  I sent it back on a Thursday and received it back in our hands before the next Friday.

5 stars.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

I want to start by saying I was extremely skeptical about buying a diamond online. After doing some research, I came across Yadav. It was fate. The selection was enormous but catalogued very well. Layla was awesome to deal with and made me feel very comfortable. When I opened the box and saw the ring for the first time I was blown away! It also appraised for almost twice what I paid for it. Good people. Good product. Good price. What else do you need?< /review>

<Review>The ring itself is gorgeous but the issue is the people who work here. We told them our budget and exactly what we were interested in and that was not respected at all. We left the store because of how ridiculously obvious they didn't care about what we could and could not afford. We built the ring online and picked it up from them. They sent us two emails stating how horrible the ring will look and how they wouldn't return it if there was an issue with it. Honestly, go either online and don't bother going in if you REALLY want this brand OR better yet, go elsewhere!< /Review><username>Ashley Edwards</username>< time>

<review>I would highly recommend considering Yadav based on my experience so far if you are shopping for the perfect ring. I was considering bluenile or jamesallen when I accidentally bumped into Yadav.
I did some research online on their very easy to use and informative site and was able to narrow down some choices with their prompt customer service. One challenge with any online purchase is the fact you don't get to see exactly what you are buying though the site does do a good job of providing detailed views and provide additional images on request plus 30 days return policy made me very comfortable.
So far my experience has been very positive, from research to shortlisting to pricing to making a purchase and post purchase support. Time will tell about craftmanship and quality.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfU0hcm9gVjTn_Z-McbpelcNU9Wayz979PEEMe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Jim and Layla are absolutely amazing to work with and really patient. I cant take my eyes off the ring that my fiance got me. So when ordering his ring, I was stubborn enough to stick with Jim's workmanship even though they are not open Saturday's anymore. (we did visit about 20 stores in the bay area but the service just didn't feel right).
Have you ever shown someone a picture of a ring and ordered it over email and phone calls? We did just that. And it looks better than what I actually took a pic of. There are no salesmen here to deal with (who might change by the next time you visit). It's Jim's business so you know he is putting his name behind every product he sells. the prices are really reasonable. no crazy markups etc.  Where I am from in india, the culture is to have a local jeweler you trust more than chain jewelers and I have found my local jeweler here :)

Helpful customer service, good selection and price.  Purchased a ring from Yadav online that was going to be my backup option, ended it up liking it better than the other one and saved myself $1100 at the same time!  Nice packaging as well.  Have already recommended Yadav to others.<//Text>

My experience with Yadav was awesome. The center stone that I chose was 50% better priced than local brick and mortar. Also they had a wider selection and variety. The best part is after my purchase I was worried about the color and configuration that I had selected and YADAV was responsive and emailed me back with good insights for every question that I had. They even gave me their opinion when I asked for it. When the ring came I could not be more satisfied. Their comments were spot on. I ordered a 2CT center stone with an I color, which I thought would look too yellow. They assured me against a gold band that I would not notice the color one bit. Non, the service rep I was dealing with was fantastic. We plan on going to Yadav in person to get our wedding bands!</review>

My husband and I upgraded my engagement ring on our 5th year anniversary. It is a solitaire diamond in a Tiffany setting (six prong). Yadav had the most competitive pricing by a long shot. Seriously... no comparison!

Shopping for the ring was a very enjoyable experience thanks to Jim! We knew what we wanted and he made it happen (accompanied by champagne, cheese and crackers). The diamond and setting was finished in a week. I'm so happy we used Yadav and would definitely go there again for any high end jewelry! I would recommend Yadav to anyone looking for the best price on any high end pieces.  Thank you, Jim!< /text>

<text>After numerous hours of shopping for an engagement ring, I chose Yadav based on their reviews and pricing. I'm so glad I did. I saved thousands on the diamond itself compared to the local retailers, and the ring is absolutely stunning. The detail in the custom engraving is awesome, and it's honestly one of the nicest engagement rings I've seen. Oh, and she said yes, so that's a plus too!<//text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x808f7e2c76ec340f:0x828e09b5c38cbe2d<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I was skeptic of buying diamonds online but hopefully this will ease a few minds.  Lauren B RS-279 quoted 8600 for 1.1 carat G color vs1 clarity.  I found 1.2 carat D color vs2 clarity on Yadav for 4000.  I asked him to custom make a ring that wasn't on his website so it would look like the lauren b ring and he quoted 1800 more for the ring.  They even sent me the 3D image of the ring so I could see what was happening each step of the way.  The ring came out beautiful.  Got the ring appraised because I was so skeptic of the deal, everything matched exactly as advertised, color, size, clarity, etc and even the side diamonds were a better color than what was promised.  I was shocked when they valued it at 12000 when I only paid 5800.  Could not be happier with the entire experience.</Text>

<text>I just received my future Fiances engagement ring from Yadav this morning. The ring is perfect and exceeded my expectations. I was a little reluctant to do business with a jeweler that I found online but Yadav really surprised me. They were professional and extremely helpful right from the start . Layla made the whole process extremely easy and I felt very comfortable with how she handled things. I will definitely be a return customer of Yadav diamond and Jewelry.<//text><user_id>103631441277969164262< /user_id>< Gmap_id>

Yadav is a honest and responsive business with good diamond and attitude but bad contractor for their rings. Me and my bf are planning to get engaged so I was looking for an engagement diamond online and found one that I like offered by Yadav. A bit on online diamonds: nowadays there's a ton of online diamond website, I think it's basically worth it to get diamonds online cuz the mark-up in physical shops are crazy, but since online diamond stores don't profit that much from their diamonds they may try to make that up by selling slightly over-priced settings. And even among online stores some are more expensive than others, like I think brilliant earth is more expensive than others; the same diamond may get listed on different store's website, like the one I picked was on Yadav and another online store called `with clarity', but Yadav's price is better, so I went with Yadav. Another funny thing is that although Yadav's diamond is cheaper than the other store, the setting is cheaper on the other store's website than Yadav's, so overall the market seems to be quite efficient. So I think the best strategy is to buy the diamond you like from the cheapest website online, and find a local physical jewelry shop to buy a setting. The mistake I made was buying a setting with Yadav: 1) it's expensive: $550 for 18k white gold solitaire setting 2) the first time they gave me a ring of the wrong size and wrong material (14 k instead of 18k) and 3) the second time they did ship me the ring size and material ring, but the diamond is clearly not set in the dead-center of the ring, and the 4 prongs of the ring were not equally spaced, so the ring looked very ugly. But they were super responsive and responsible during the whole process- they always reply email the next day, and they did stand up to what they promised - free return within 30 days with no question asked, and they gave me pre-paid shipping label with insurance on the shipping. I think what happened is that their business model is just to cut cost as much as possible so that they can earn money even when selling diamond at low margin, so they basically find the cheapest contractor out there to make their rings, which means their rings are poor-quality. So I would suggest buying diamond from them but not the ring, and find local jewelry shop to get a ring setting and set the diamond.< /Text>

At first, I was hesitant to purchase a diamond ring online but after reading all reviews and talking to them a few times over the phone I took the plunge.  I'm glad I did and my wife loves the ring.</Text>< pics>

Buying a diamond is a scary thing, especially online. The wonderful team at Yadav worked with us and made the experience so easy! They accepted partial payments until the diamond was completely paid for. The stone arrived overnight and was taken to a jeweler for inspection. It appraised for well over what we paid and matched the GIA report. If you have any reservations about buying online, rest assured that this is the right choice; you cannot beat the deal and service! Thank you, Yadav!< /text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>I used rare carat to find the diamond I wanted. That website broke down the best deals on diamonds by price based on the color, carat size, clarity, cut, and certification desired. You were then able to click on the diamond to see see a zoomed in view of the diamond which made picking one easy. Yadav was one of three websites offering the diamond I chose. Based on the diamond chose I was then able to pick the type of setting I wanted. They provided me with several options to choose from, where the other websites provided few options. The price of each setting was displayed and an image of what the diamond would look like was displayed.

Yadav offers a 30 day money back guarantee which is awesome. They’ll also resize the ring for free, which I won’t get to use because my fiancée won’t take the ring off. They offer several options to pay. The cost of the diamond using this process was less than half what a diamond of equal size, certification, cut, color and lesser clarity would have cost at Kay or any of the other large retailers. Most importantly my fiancée loves it. Awesome website. Highly recommend using it.</Review>< pictures>

I shopped around for some time before finding Yadav. They have a great selection, incredible pricing and a very user-friendly website that made the whole diamond buying experience enjoyable. The Diamond was shipped quickly and in discrete pacakaging. Myself, and especially my fiancé, are thrilled with the diamond. I would highly recommend Yadav to everyone.</review>

Super helpful customer service, and beautiful stones and rings. My now fiance cried when she saw it, and I'm pretty sure it was out of happiness. The prices are extremely fair as well, I shopped for the stone using rare carat and found that Yadav had the nicest stones and the best deals amongst all the jewelers available.</review>

After deciding to pop the question I shopped around local jewelers and on other online stores. However I was skeptical of making such an important purchase online and without seeing it in person but after reading all the reviews and speaking to their team I felt more at ease. The service I received by the Yadav team was exceptional, between all the questions I had through countless email and phone calls they answered them all seamlessly. They had the ring I picked out made, the diamond set, and shipped on the promised time frame. When I got the ring I took it in to a Diamonds Direct store to compare to a second ring a had on hold there and they just couldn’t compete. Yadav ring was higher in quality, bigger center stone, better in clarity, and for a faction of the price. Diamonds Direct priced the 1 carat, H in color, VS1 diamond I got from Yadav $2100 more than I paid for the lose diamond it self. Both my fiancé and I couldn’t be happier with it and the countless compliments she gets on her ring. Thank you Yadav Jewelers.< /Text>

I would recommend Yadav Jewelry to everyone. The quality is top-notch and their prices are the best around. I stumbled upon Yadav through Rare Carat. The prices for the diamond I was looking for were hundreds of dollars cheaper than the more well known websites and even local jewelery stores.

I (and my now fiancee) was blown away by the quality of the diamond and the ring. The smile it puts on her face every time she looks at it, it's worth every penny and more. Yadav took an intimidating process and made it easier than one could reasonably ask. Yadav has my trust and business for life.</text>

I cannot imagine a better diamond buying experience and will absolutely work with Yadav again. I looked at about a dozen stores for an engagement ring (mostly online but two local jewelers as well) and settled on yadav because they had the best price for the stone/setting combo I was looking for. The purchase process was extremely smooth and went as expected. I was short on time because I was leaving on a trip where I hoped to propose so they got the diamond in early, mounted it and sent someone to meet me on thanksgiving at SFO to hand deliver it because UPS wouldn't make it in time. The hand delivery on a holiday was really above and beyond and showed me their commitment to doing everything they could to make a customer happy.</Text>

My search for my now Fiancé’s diamond ring started back in November 2016.  I've looked at hundreds of very overpriced diamonds until I came across Yadav.  They had quality diamonds at reasonable prices and beautiful rings as well.  I spent 10 minutes looking on the site when I found the diamond, and it's ring.  The entire experience was painless, and I have one extremely happy lady!</Review>

Buying and importing a diamond from overseas was probably one of the most stressful experiences in my life (so far anyway). However, the staff at Yadav look after you from beginning to end, and they won't stop until you're completely satisfied. They respond to all email correspondence and phone calls very promptly, and they go above and beyond to deliver outstanding service. Thank you for all your help!< /Review>

Yadav is an elite jeweler.  Jim offers top notch products and exceptional customer service.  I purchased my engagement ring from Yadav and the ring looks absolutely stunning.  More importantly, Yadav's customer service blew me away.  I made a critical error listing my shipping address yet Yadav responded quickly and efficiently and got the ring to me days before I popped the question.  I will always come to Yadav first for my future jewelry needs!< /review>

It was specific. Rose gold with my fiancé's grandmother's pear-shaped diamond. There wasn't a local jewelry store that had what I was looking for. Then a friend recommended Yadav. Within a quick search, I found exactly what I was looking at the right price! It was a huge relief. But wait, there's more! The customer service was by-far the best. Very friendly, understanding of my needs and time crunch. They sent me the ring and I was able to not only propose, but my fiancé said that the ring was..."PERFECT!" Stress no more. I will always recommend Yadav.</Text>

I purchased a diamond through Yadav after finding them on a site called RareCarat and ended up extremely pleased with the outcome. There was a bit of an unexpected delay due to one of Yadav's suppliers, but the company owned up to it and made up for the issue. Would recommend.<//text>

< Review>
The ring was beautiful and the diamond is great, but there is fire scale/discoloration on the ring after only 5 months. The ring was 18K yellow gold, and the soldered joints are turning a rose gold color. We confirmed with a local jeweler that the ring should not be turning this color; it should've been fused, not soldered. I expressed my disappointment with Yadav, and their response was that the discoloration was due to normal wear and tear (in 5 months!), and offered to polish the ring if we paid $70 to ship it back to them. I replied that the discoloration was not due to normal wear and tear but was in fact due to poor craftsmanship. That email was sent on November 16th, and I have not received a reply, hence this review.

UPDATE 1: I have head back from the owner; they agreed to pay to ship the ring back and check it out, so they have worked to rectify the situation. As such, I have adjusted my rating to 3 stars, and we'll see how the situation gets solved ultimately.

UPDATE 2: After back and forth, I was contacted by the owner, who agreed to pay to ship the ring back. Assumedly, they inspected the setting and determined the setting needed to be replaced. I believe they had a knew one built (although that was never made clear to me) and shipped it back. I believe the process took about 3 weeks.

We are satisfied with the service and my fiance gets compliments on the ring very often. I would recommend Yadav to a purchaser; if there are issues, they will fix them, you just have to stay on them.</Review>

The chat feature for quick questions was amazing.
Guaranteed communication made me very confident in my purchase.
I couldn't be more than happy with the entire process.
I feel strongly that I ended up with a much higher quality diamond that I would have ended up with at a local jeweler.
I had to guess on size and I was off.  Shipping it back, having it resized, and getting it back all within a weeks time?  Amazing!!!
Keep up the great work @diamondsonweb< /Review>

Naturally I was hesitant making such a large purchase online without seeing the diamond in person, but I went through dozens of reviews and decided to go for it. I could not be happier. Their website is very user friendly and there online support staff was amazing. I must have asked a million questions in their chat feature, and every one of them was answered quickly and efficiently. In addition, I was on a very strict schedule as far as when I needed the ring by, and they worked with me and got me the ring in less than two weeks from my purchase date all the way out to the east coast! Now for the ring! I was blown away when I saw it. Stunning! The Tami setting that I picked out is fantastic and was perfectly sized to what I requested. The woman who is now my fiancée loves it. The diamond sparkles so incredibly, and is so clear. The price was mindblowing. This is the first jeweler I have ever dealt with where I feel like I got way more than I paid for. Great prices! I didn't have to cut any corners and still got a beautiful ring! I will be a permanent customer for Yadav from now on!

I am Yadav's client since 2013 and have a great experience with Jim, Layla and Karen.
Their customer service is excellent. They alway listen to you carefully and do their best to accommodate your wish with any budget you have. Jim is one of the most honest people I have ever known. One of his advantage versus any other jewelry stores or diamond wholesalers is that he gives you plenty of time to think and make a right decision for your diamond selection. I studied a lot about diamonds and visited over 10 jewelry stores and also diamond-wholesalers but couldn't find anyone to give me a better price than him. You can trust Yadav, you won't be regret.</text>

He was patient and listened intently to what I was looking for.  My ring design was very specific.  He had just the stone for my fiance.  Equally as good was the communication with Layla in the office. She was easy to reach and her follow through was exceptional. When my fiance came in to get it fitted, the entire team (including Mr. Fu) recognised us and celebrated in our special moment.  Jim will be a jeweller for life !!!<//Text>< Pictures>

<user_name>Lucy Bacque</user_name><Text>My fiance and I found Yadav online using rare carat and while we were wary about buying an engagement ring site unseen, the prices, positive reviews, and return policies convinced us to give it a shot. We decided to purchase just the loose diamond first so that I could shop for settings in person and see how they looked on my hand. The jeweler we originally chose for a setting ooo-ed and aaah-ed at how amazing the diamond was but then tried to argue that it wouldn't fit the setting we liked and that we should buy a lesser diamond from them. The price they quoted was more than double what we paid on Yadav for a lower cut, color, and clarity.

In the end we chose a nicer setting from Yadav and couldn't be happier. It was made in exactly my ring size and the setting fits the diamond we chose perfectly. The compliments keep pouring in.</Text>< Pics>

Recently purchased a GIA diamond + setting with Yadav and it was a fantastic experience overall. I did weeks of research and found exactly what I wanted at Yadav at a very competitive price (it was second lowest) and went with them due to the good reviews. They customized the setting without additional cost and honored an online coupon as well. I wired over money and received an additional discount. On top of this, the price of the diamond actually dropped before the wire completed and they provided me a price adjustment refund!!! Diamond arrived packaged very well and it was overnight shipped via fedex and coulnd't be happier. The only complaint I would have is sometimes they didn't provide updates on what was going on and I had to call/email to find out, but otherwise I definitely am very happy with my experience and recommend to anyone on the fence, even if you're not able to visit in person (I'm on the east coast).<//text>

<text>I bought an engagement ring through Yadav after discovering them on RareCarat.  Local jewelers weren't able or weren't willing to compete pricewise with Yadav. I needed a quick turn-around and they were able to do that for me. The diamond was beautiful. After seeing the setting in person, we decided to send it back and get a different one (that she liked better). They did that quickly and actually ended up crediting me $40 because the new setting was cheaper. Pleasure to work with for the purchase of a lifetime.</text>< pictures>

<text>Yadav was recommended to me by a friend who likes to do meticulous research on things before buying them. I wasn't nervous about buying a diamond online necessarily, but I was unsure of how it would work, since the last time I bought a diamond, I went from store to store looking at loose diamonds until I found the right one.

I called Yadav and they assured me on the phone that they would overnight the diamond, and if it wasn't to my liking, I could just send it back, on their dime. What did I have to lose?

Yadav's website made it very easy to search through many different diamonds at once. You can enter in various search criteria in terms of cost, quality, etc., and then you can look at each actual diamond and its associated GIA report (if applicable). Most came with a full 360-view video, and I found this to be very easy to see any defect/inclusions at different angles.

Once I selected a diamond, it was overnighted to me, double-boxed in a standard large UPS priority box, with no obvious signage on the outside that the box contained anything of significant value. The return address did not even mention that it came from a jewelry store.

In my case, the diamond was exactly what was displayed online, down to every last detail. There were no unexpected surprises. What I saw was what I got, and it was stunning!

Fantastic quality at an amazing price. I am 100% satisfied, and would recommend Yadav to anyone looking for a diamond.</text>< pics>

<review>I purchased my fiancee a color E VVS Excellent 1 carat diamond and its so far the best quality in the same grade. The price is very afforadble comparing to the market. Shipping is extremly secure, they literally put 5 ups and fedex boxes with separate postages on each box over another. Signature required indeed. When i had a few questions on the diamond gradings, the manager did not heistate to help with all her patience. I highly recommend this jewler to every man who is shopping for their loved one.<//review>< pictures>

Recently purchased an engagement ring from YADAV and I have to say I was very impressed with it. I was working with a tight window and they were more than happy to help get it to me within reasonable time. I highly recommend YADAV to anyone who's looking for for quality jewelry.< /text>

When I found the diamond that I wanted, YADAV worked with me to create a custom setting that matched my girlfriend's tastes. I had very specific requirements and YADAV did a fantastic job in managing my needs. I am very happy with the service that I received, and especially grateful to Layla who served as my go-to contract during the whole process. I would highly recommend YADAV.</Review>

<Review>Amazing experience. I spent weeks if not months researching online diamond/engagement ring companies and finally purchased an engagement ring from a competitor of Yadav.  I anxiously awaited its arrival only to open the package and feel a sinking sense of disappointment with the quality of the setting and the size of the center stone.  However, given my lengthy search, I was unsure that I would be able to find anything that I felt was a better option. After thinking about it, I decided to make a final effort to find another ring and ordered the Zadie ring from Yadav with a 2.03 carat H, VVS1 center stone. When the ring finally arrived, I opened the package somewhat hesitantly, afraid that I would have spent more time and money for naught. But all those feelings faded immediately when I laid eyes on the beautiful piece of craftsmanship that I had received.  I knew I had found “the one” and It far exceeded my expectations.  All I can say is thank you Yadav for allowing me to acquire such a beautiful piece of jewelry that will be a foundation of my future marriage.  By providing such high quality products at an incredibly affordable price, you have made at least one young couple very happy and very grateful.</Review>< pictures>

Before I got engaged to my girlfriend, I had always wondered why diamonds meant so much. After learning about diamonds, and receiving guidance from Jim and the rest of Yadav, I found a new appreciation for diamonds and their incredible nature. The ring I purchased is a perfect symbol of my love for my fiancé.

I am forever appreciative of Yadav’s help in choosing the ring of my fiancé’s dreams. They were patient throughout the entire process, responsive to all emails and calls, and went the extra mile to finish the ring in a very short period of time.

There was incredible transparency throughout the entire process, and I will 100% go back to Yadav for all future jewelry. Incredible people, incredible talent. I highly recommend them!<//review>

<Review>If you want to buy a diamond or an engagement ring come see Jim.

I was looking for a very specific oval diamond and was not having any luck with jewelry stores or even other places in the giftcenter & jewelrymart. All the jewelry showrooms were pushy, didn't have much selection, and worst of all had high prices. I came to Jim's office based on his yelp reviews and he was able to find a few stones that matched my exact requirements and had them in his office two days later! His prices were fair (just as good as online) and I got to see the diamond in person. I also had him make a custom engagement ring which only took 7 business days and my Fiancée couldn't be happier with it!

Jim has great prices, very fast service, and isn't a pushy jewelry store.</Review>< user_name>

<user_name>Sarah Spencer< /user_name><Date>1485471234221</Date><Rate>5< /Rate><review>When my fiancé was shopping for a ring/diamond, we got the feeling that traditional jewelry stores were not giving us the best deal. We heard some people warn us to shopping online for diamonds, but we decided to look into it anyways. After doing extensive research we were impressed with Yadav's reviews and found a loose diamond that was perfect for us - and such a great deal.

We still were wary that it might be "too good to be true," but saw they were accredited by the BBB and that the diamonds were certified by GIA. We ordered and had a good experience. The lady even recommended that we should have our diamond inspected upon its arrival. When the diamond arrived we took it to a local jeweler to ensure that the serial number matched the GIA report and everything matched up, and the diamond was beautiful and just like the high res pictures we'd seen online.

Any friends getting engaged we recommend to use Yadav and get the most of their money. We wouldn't have been able to get something near as nice at this price at any of the local jewelry stores.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

While there was a slight question between the diamond shown in the search results and in the specific details, a phone call with an employee helped resolve the issue.  I was sent details and confirmed the photo of the diamond, and it came exactly as expected. I will use Yadav again someday and would recommend them to others looking for a stone/ring.<//review>< Pictures>
