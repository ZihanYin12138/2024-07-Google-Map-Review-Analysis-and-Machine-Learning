I had the ribeye steak was probably one of the better steaks I've had in a long time love the peppercorn sauce very good. The wife had beef tips with pasta that was really good I might have to have that for next time I go back. Staff was very friendly the restaurant was clean will definitely be going back.</review>

It reminds me of a locally high-end restaurant. It's not very fine dining but definitely for the area it's not bad. It has is Chicago style theme which is pretty cool.<//text>< pictures>

<Date>1581780267265<//Date><review>First time there, bad experience. Waited 2 hours for my food. People were walking out after being seated for a hour without even a appetizer. I tried to give them a benefit of the doubt cause they were busy but the whole staff looked like chickens running around with theyre heads cut off. I have a lot of patience but 2 hours was too much. My dinner came with a dessert and told them just keep it, i was really just ready to leave. I could of just walked out and not paid and no one would have noticed but i did the right thing even though im still upset about the bad service. Hope this helps someone down the road. Good luck.</review><Gmap_id>0x8094e2bb17b994ef:0x98932c67ced4d003< /Gmap_id>< Pictures>

Tonight i took my folks there for their 55th wedding anniversary. they had been there before but tonight was my first. i thought the service and hospitality was over the top as was the food. i don't drink much but i enjoyed sitting at the bar chatting with the bartender she was very helpful teaching me how to take pictures. and very easy on the eyes.<//Text>

Service was great, drinks were spot on. Erica makes an amazing raspberry lemondrop! Appetizers and drinks tonight only. Appetizers were good, but would have liked the flat bread on the Black and Blue appetizer to be toasted and a little crisper. The fried zucchini was really good. Overall a nice evening for two!</Review>

Excellent higher end local restaurant that still has a relaxed, casual feel. Great service, too! I always get the shrimp scampi, which is delicious!! The sweet potato fries are also a good appetizer with their aioli dipping sauce.</text>

<Review>HEADS UP!! JON'S BEAR CLUB OR "BEAR CLUB" in Reedley will NOT support any past gift certificates! My parents recently tried to use a gift certificate that they had and the owner said they do NOT honor them do to their name change a WEEK ago!! Which was changed to "Bear Club" instead of "Jon's Bear Club" Very Bad business! Therefore, my parents and many others do not support this business. Even though I found this article talking about the new ownership.

Quoted "Koobation said the restaurant will be called the Bear Club under Reyes’ ownership. All outstanding gift certificates will be honored by the new owner, he added."

Well obviously they don't care about their customers. I thought when you buy the restaurant you are also buying their customers...The refusal to honor past gift certificates caused once loyal customers to lose their respect for the establishment.< /Review></record>

The sandwich i ordered the first time was delicious, the Buffalo cauliflower was great too & the people are very nice. My only complaint would be, i ordered the Cali Caprese and did not receive what was explained online. The “mixed greens” looked like chopped ice berg lettuce & no basil. When I called to confirm it was supposed to be exactly what i got she said yes and people who don’t know what it is think it’s a salad. I’ve had Caprese before but at least it came with basil.</Review>< name>

<Rating>3< /Rating><user_name>Justin Walker<//user_name><review>Definitely don't go for the steak. The sauteed onions and mushrooms were kinda underdone and flavorless and the rare steak was tough. The concept also doesn't make much sense. Way less "tropics," way more "ale house." Like, it was plainly decorated a certain way before a change of hands and no one bothered to update anything except the taps. The staff was nice though!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

Tropics Ale House Midtown serves very, very yummy food at a great price and has a large and varied menu of beer on tap to choose from.  My favorite is the Coconut Hiwa Porter!!!  We love the ambiance and we get seated really quickly.  The service is great!  From pork kahlua to poke, this place serves fresh food fast and you will love it!!!</review>

<review>Mahalo, Tropical Brandon! 🍹🙏 Fantastic pandemic accommodations. Love the outward facing screens for games. Can't beat the Happy Hour- just wish it would go until 6:30 or 7 so I can wash up after work. 😅 But that's on me, not them. Decided to leave a more comprehensive review after seeing that they do take notice. That says a lot about them in itself. New favorite in Lavender.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

As someone born and raised being able to talk to the owner who lived and shared the Hawaiian culture and respected it. He brings it here to sacramento and the food and drinks alone are amazing their happy hour deals are amazing and if you don't leave there feeling good. Try the bourbon pecan pie. 5 stars in my opinion. aloha<//Review></record>

This spot is my favorite. I eat in many restaurants but to this one I  constantly return again and again. The crew is very chummy and the cuisine they serve is so good. I am always happy to have a good meal in this restaurant. I highly recommend this place.< /text>

First time here, great service, excellent food. I most definitely will be back! The poke was fresh and the fish and frys were yummy. I don't usually like frys but I most definitely liked these. Crispy and seasoned well. Amanda was our server and she was spot on!< /Review>

The happy hour prices were pretty reasonable and their volcano fries, delicious. I felt like their alcohol selection for happy hour was misleading, but it could have been helped by asking questions so it was somewhat my fault. Overall, I enjoyed my experience and I would go again.< /Review>

The beer selection was good and the prices were reasonable. I got the happy hour order of the volcano fries which were good. They have a ton of bar space and TV's, so great for watching a game. I was however a bit disappointed with the menu selection which lacked more authentic-style Hawaiian dishes. Midtown doesn't have any legit Hawaiian dishes so I felt this was a missed opportunity. If they add a dish with: rice, macaroni salad, BBQ beef, chicken, or short ribs - I'd give this place 5 stars. Seriously one or two authentic dishes away from me being here everyday!< /text><Time>1571957177300</Time>< GmapID>

<Date>1577683934891</Date><review>Been coming for the past few Sundays for football games. They cover the 49ers and Raiders games at minimum. The bonus is with all the TV's they can cover the rest of the league too. They have some deals for food and drinks on NFL days, outside of that my friend's ordered some regular food and devoured it. The staff are great and have done a wonderful job every visit. Love the atmosphere and definitely will come back for other sporting events.<//review>< Rating>

Tropic Ale House is located where the old Petes was on J and 20th and has since become my new watering hole.

As you step your foot into the establishment, you are welcomed by the Hawaiian flag and friendly faces.

The menu offers a wide variety of delicious and mouth-watering dishes. All of the cuisine I have sampled thus far has been fresh, savory, and always makes me want to go for seconds.

The drinks are Hawaii inspired and surely worth trying.

The service is always of the highest caliber, Tiffany and Amanda are always full of warmth and thoughtful of their guests.

Because of the brilliant atmosphere and delicious food service, I highly recommend going to the Tropic Ale House.<//Text>

Went there at around 3:00 in the afternoon on a Monday for a quick bite before a 4:30 movie. The place had five other people there. Bartender took our order of two orders of poke (one of each of the only poke dishes they offer) and an order of fries. A few minutes later he had to come back and clarify this already simple order. We then wait 20 to 25 minutes for the food to then have him come back to us again and say there was a problem and ask us YET AGAIN what we ordered. By this time it was 3:45 and we couldn't wait even more and be late for the movie. We told him to just cancel it and left. Spend your money someplace else.<//Review>

Visiting the Sacramento area. Stopped into Tropics for a quick bite to eat. My order was messed up, service was not great. Alena, the manager fixed my order and made my initial bad experience a better one. An asset to the restaurant!< /Text>

<Date>1594667421239<//Date><rate>1</rate><text>On June 8th Tony’s driver, David F., ran over my parked Harley in Costco’s parking lot then tried to flee the scene—only stopping when witnesses stopped him. When I called to report this to Tony’s I was told by their employee  Mike D, that he was aware of the situation and he told me to get an estimate, FAX it over to the company, and they would take care of it. Instead Tony personally tried to deny his driver’s negligence in the whole matter. After a two week delay he submitted it to his insurance, never once getting in touch with me to resolve the issue. A month after the accident when I reach out to Tony’s (after many previous attempts) I was told the information had been submitted to their insurance and I was only given the insurance info after I demanded it. This company is irresponsible and dishonest and their company practices are shady. Please think twice before conducting any business with them. God forbid one of their drivers hits something of yours and tries to flee. Standard operating procedure for Tony’s....deny</text>< pictures>

Come early, park on the road, and check in with the friendly, efficient guard.  They will almost always unload you early.  Be prepared for some challenging backing tho, almost no room to pull up.<//Review>

If the truck drivers are any indication of the company, I wouldn't do business with them.   Truck driver pulled in front of on coming vehicles,  running a red light, and nearly causing an accident.  (Dash cam footage available)</text>

This restaurant is my first choice site.  Of all restaurants I know I favor it most. I always suggests to my friends to go to visit this place. Whenever  I want to go to a decent lunchon, this place comes straight to my mind.  Great and all kinds of  food and a large menu.professional staff, and nice mood. And very important, the cost is modest. I tell about this place with great pleasure.< /review>

This restaurant is obviously one of the most attractive place to eat in the neighborhood. Every time I visit this place I am awfully satisfied. They preserve their high  standard service and the highest level of meals  they give. You definitely will enjoy this this place. Very  recommended.</Text>

We went their for a birthday celebration and ordered the buffet meal. Even though the waitress was great and did a awesome serving us. But the foods is absolutely unacceptable, food can out super slow. Went finished first round of orders, we wait over 10 minutes for the second orders to come. The garlic shrimp 🍤 is not fresh and the soup is salty. Only best tonight was their service is make up for the lack of fresh food.<//review>

<Rating>3<//Rating><Review>I don't know what happened with this place. The food use to be delicious. I ordered the Bento Box with 2 sides. (Katsu Chicken/ Tempura Shrimp)
FIRST of all, I noticed the Tempura Shrimp was not Tempura. It looked like it was fried in the same batter as the Katsu Chicken.
Second I noticed they don't give you salad it's some gross looking Cole slaw with purple cabbage.  It's is  a bit misleading from what I seen in the picture and have ordered this meal previously.
Lastly the chicken was dry. With all that being said I'm not sure if they have a new cook or what. But it's not the same.< /Review>< pics>

I ordered food through doordash and when I received it, there was some weird smell coming from the food. All the sushi rolls had a same like old rice smell or old ingredients and I just couldn't eat any of the sushi. Definitely won't be ordering any sushi from here again. Also, paid extra for cauliflower rice but got regular rice instead.</review>

I found this restaurant on Door Dash and ordered on there a few times. My food came nicely packaged and the rolls tasted great, despite the delay on Door Dash's end  Next time, I'm going to order at the restaurant to save on Door Dash fees/complications.<//Review>

Absolutely terrible order this night! I don't know what happened to this place.
The tofu came pretty lukewarm, and the beef that my roommate had was overcooked to the point where it was almost burnt!

Every other time I got a rainbow roll it had Unagi (Eel) on it, but this time 2 sections of the rainbow roll were just cheap tasting imitation
krab, but that's not all!

the salmon on the rainbow roll had paper on it, which was stuck to the fish, making an entire section of the rainbow roll impossible to eat! Absolutely terrible waste of $50, the best part of this meal was the $1.91 package of miso soup I got at a supermarket was the best part of the meal. 👎🏼</review>

I recommend the GARLIC SALMON roll. It tastes great! I always order 2 of these with a mystery roll to get a garlic salmon roll for FREE during happy hour.  Yes FREE sushi rolls!!

EDIT- The missus asked if they have a corkage fee. $10 for any bottle of wine you bring. We plan on having our weekly date night at Sushimono now! Happy hour + $10 corkage fee. Date night without breaking the bank! =)< /review>

Let me start with Its my daughters first birthday we frequent the Sunrise location which is always fantastic The Elk Grove one I will NEVER VISIT AGAIN. Servers were fine, most of our food had arrived and was good we were told it was going to take a minute on our lion king. 20 MINUTES LATER THE FOOD they tried to pass off was rotten fish for a baked salmon roll. INSTANT HEAD ACHE AND DISGUSTING TASTE like it was defrosted fish which I am pretty sure NO PROPER SUSHI RESTAURANT would serve.  I WOULDN'T Feed that to a dog if I could give 0 stars I would.</text>

<Review>This is our favorite spot for sushi. All of the rolls are excellent, and the prices are reasonable. I haven't ever come here when it's too busy or there is a long wait.
The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because the Korean BBQ was really lackluster. The flavor wasn't that great, and the grill was quickly covered in burned on seasoning that stuck to all of the food. If you come here, I'd recommend only getting the sushi.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I've only had takeout from this Sushimono Elk Grove location, and all my experiences have been great. Happy hour even extends to takeout - buy 2 speciality rolls (which is all we were planning on) and we were thrilled to get another speciality roll free. Excellent specialty rolls & sashimi, and always super friendly staff (even just when picking up said takeout).</text>

Waited for an hour for simple rolls, and witnessed customers served before us that arrived after we did. Quality of food wasn't worth forty five dollars. We could have gone to Mikuni and at least had a timely dinner with much better flavor.</text>

It was clean, fresh, and had a good fattiness to it.  I'm drooling just thinking about it now.  Most definitely will come back and I highly recommend everyone to try them out. Oh yeah. They have all you can eat option.  For both sushi and Korean BBQ. Pretty awesome deal. However, I can't eat much, so I like that I can just order items from the menu without having to pay the all you can eat price.   Win win for everyone.</review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

We finally tried the AYCE in the back this past week. My group and I ordered from the option A menu which has fewer options than option B, however there were enough choices to accomodate the needs of our unique group ranging in age of 3-75 years. We even had someone with strict dietary restrictions and they did not leave the restaurant hungry. We would definitely recommend this restaurant to our other family members and friends.</Review>

<review>Ordered Chicken Katsu and Pork Gyoza bento box. Katsu had absolutely no flavor (bland). Miso soup was literally just broth and miso paste. No tofu, no seaweed, no spring onion. Ninja roll was rubbery and had no flavor. Won't be ordering from here again. Only the Gyoza and salad actually tasted like it should have.</review>< pictures>

Ordered Agedashi tofu and they gave me the same sauce as my tempura. The tempura was not tempura,  it was more like shrimp with some other coating. Didn't feel like it had Japanese feel for the items that I ordered. Disappointed that my tempura shrimp didn't have tempura batter - definitely not the kind of tempura that most Japanese restaurants use.<//Text>

Horrible I love the sushi  so I decided to try the all you can eat ( full discloser same price as Oz)  and it was awful they did not come
To our table to see if we wanted more and they were so pushy when we were seated to hurry and order that they got rude because I had question I honestly will not go back even for their great sushi  no refill or anything the whole two hours we where their side note after two hours there’s a second charge so I ended up canceling the second order they finally came along to get in getting my check $55 later turns out I’m still hungry save your money go to Oz<//review>

Everything was ok except the Lion King roll. It was old. The avocado in it was brown (it takes an avocado 6 hours to turn fully brown). The rice was starting to get hard, and the inside was cold. I ordered for delivery and the driver was great. However, the restaurant is putting old food into delivery orders and not making fresh. Won't be ordering here again. There are sushi places that make fresh sushi in town.</Text>

Horrible!! Stay away at all costs. This place deserves zero stars. The cups that the green tea was poured in smelled like bleach from the dishwasher, wasabi and ginger had no color from being obviously old. We ordered nothing but vegetarian rolls and even the cucumber tasted slimy and sour. Nevertheless, we didn’t drink the green tea and barely ate any of the sushi. I wasted $40 taking out a client to what I’m shocked to be a restaurant still in business. Never again!!! Oh and my client fell ill later in the afternoon.<//text>

Quality has slipped alot. For example, ordered vegetable tempura and the batter on the vegetables was very gummy/chewy, not crunchy. Disappointing.</review>

Food was okay. Ordered the caliente roll and the tempura was very stale and spongey as if it were sitting out waiting to be rolled.</text>

This used to be an excellent place to dine for sushi. My experience today was terrible. The floors were greasy and very slippery throughout the restaurant. The restrooms were dirty and didn't smell clean at all. There was also dirt and urine on the floor. Service was very poor. There were several items on the menu that were NOT actually available. Overall, I would consider other establishments in the area until this place cleans up substantially.< /review>

What's cool is they offer a self cooking grill, so there are items that you can cook to your preference & it comes at your speed. No waiting on the cook. Here's the con, fountain drinks aren't refillable & cost $2. I wasn't pleased with that. Even though they offer a lot, that was my only gripe & reason for 4/5 stars.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I go for the sushi and appetizers.   The 911 appetizer is great and do not shy away from the mystery roll!  I have never ever been disappointed when I order it!  Fresh fresh fish and great service.  Dont forget the cold peach sake.  They surprised us one night with this recommendation and it was great!< /Text>

Normally love this place with fast service, but on our last visit we were shoved in a freezing corner and our kids food was delivered 20 minutes before our food. Thus having them squirm and wiggle while we tried to scarf down our meal as quick as possible. The server never once checked on us after ordering, or after our food was served.  Sad night for sure.< /Review>

<Text>For a place that puts safety first (I think) since there are propane fueled tables, their Emergency exit is blocked by boxes of Asahi beer, a silver hand truck, and dirty dish carts.

Given that the service can be slow (like waiting for hot water in the shower) during busy hours or special occasions, like Fathers' Day, I don't think they would have staff ready to direct people if emergency occurs.

The food is good though, once you get it. For example, made-to-order sushi. You'll starve a bit while waiting, but worth it. Just plan to stay there for at least 3 hours to get a full meal.< /Text>< Rating>

If you have a party of 10-20 go else where because it looked Iike they were struggling to keep afloat with us. Food ad all you can eat, but we had to wait 30mins for eat plate of raw food to cook ourself, time limit was 2 hours? As a big party people like to chat and eat. You put a time limit on a huge party that you can’t even accommodate. How hard is it to cut up raw meat and serve in a mannerly time. Not to mention bland food with no seasoning or dipping sauce. Korean/Japanese? Where are they trying to fool. They seem confused, not to mention if you see a large group and you can’t accommodate please just tell us.

The food is great! The staff are usually very friendly and portion sizes are good. The one thing I am concerned about is their sanitation. There were a couple of times where I ate at Sushimono and I got a stomachache afterwards. Other than that, great place.< /Text>

<Text>Service was actually good, as well as the food.  They're just too quick to clean your table. We had a to go box and accidentally forgot when we left our table. We realize it after, when we were walking towards our car (2 minutes) and my bf run back to go get it but they didn't even wait for a few minutes for us to come back and get it. They just tossed it away.  Manager said they're not responsible 😳.  Very disappointed after this.<//Text><gmapID>0x809ac7b75952fe6d:0x137cd564f1bc1008< /gmapID>< Pictures>

<Review>Good food, only negative is this is the only restaurant I've ever been to that allows their busboy to say his pants and show all his boxers. That is classless and disrespectful. So for that, it makes this place a 1 out if 5. Hopefully they understand, no parent wants their children to think that's ok. Have some pride and respect!<//Review>< Pictures>

I was prepared to write this place off after my first visit. The service was terrible and it took over an hour to get my order. But that was when they first opened. It took some convincing to go back but I'm glad to have given them a second chance. They've improved their service considerably and the sushi is top notch. Not to mention fairly priced.< /review>

Dirty, dingy, sub par service, and the sushi - ugh. The fish is not fresh tasting, and the sauces taste like pure mayonnaise. Gross. Even my tofu in the miso soup tasted moldy. Definitely will not return.< /Review>

They have a variety of options. From an all you can eat option to a hibatchi area and half off rolls. You really can't beat it. I would recommend this place to all of my friends.< /text></record></dataset><record>

All you can eat is only for 2 people or more. Never heard of that policy before. So if you go alone like I did, you're out of luck. Food was average. Their house salad and bbq albacore were smothered in sauce. Too "mayoey". Staff was friendly. Probably won't go back< /Review>

< review>
I had a higher rating in the beginning  but lowered my rating over  time and especially due to my experience last night on 3/15. My roommates and I are regulars  and often go here for a household outing around 1 time or more a month ( group of 7). This place has recently had new management and therefore gone through some changes (not all bad decorations are nice). Well last night 6 of us adults went along with 2 children first we were seated at a table that only had 1 working grill. Mind you you're on a time limit for time you can eat and that includes your grilling time , there are a lot of us that were planning on cooking meat so we asked if we could get moved to another table. The server said no and said all the tables are like that. We asked to get seated at the table we always go to because we know for sure that one works. She got very frustrated and was trying to argue and say no until she went and talked to her manager and they moved us to the other table. Service after that was terrible. Some of the things we ordered never got brought out . I had tofu on the bottom of my rice bowls leading me to believe my bowl wasn't previously cleaned from the miso soup. Our server never came back to give us a refill on drinks we had to ask other servers to get her attention for us. Some of the rolls that were brought out weren't what we ordered but we were weren't trying to be negative because we came there to celebrate a birthday. 3 in our party didn't get eating utensils and since she never came back we had to go grab some ourself. They let us keep 1 single menu for all of us to look at and when she came over she would rush us and you could tell she would get frustrated if we didn't know what we wanted right away. 1 in our party wanted to opt out of the all you can eat and only ordered 1 roll which we've never had a problem with in the past because either way they're making good money off of us. So in the end we kept waiting and waiting for our server for our check ( we tried getting her attention once again in the middle of our dining experience to let her know how we were splitting the check up in advance) we waited for 15 minutes until eventually a member of our party got up and went to get it ourselves. They now added on a policy that if your party is over 6 you automatically get charged an 18% gratuity tip for server ( remember we always went in with 7 people)  So on EVERYONES  check she got an 18% tip. For 2 adults and 2 kids we paid 100 and only got $2.00 back. They did not tell us u til after we all paid . All of us together our total bill was 169.00 and 18% of that would have only been around $30.00 BUT since everyone was charged 18% she actually made around $60.00 . Also the1 person in our party was still charged all you can eat after only getting 1 roll and was told they're sticking to their policy. Pretty bad way to rob and cheat customers ESPECIALLY your regulars. We will not be going back here anymore and will find a new place.<//review>

<Review>Awful service!  We had a party of 10 and once we ordered the first round of food, it was all down hill from there.  The waitress never came back to check on us or get our next round of food.  We waited 30 minutes between the first order of meat/food and the next order.  Only when we got up and brought our dirty dishes to the front of the restaurant did she come over and take our next order.  She apologized for the long wait and said they had to prepare the food, but what about the raw meat? It did not need to be "prepared" - no excuse there.
The manager walked by our table many times and never asked us if we were O.K. or needed anything. The restaurant was only 1/2 full and the service was just discraceful - no one ever picked up dirty dishes from any of the tables!  It's not like the place was busy - God only knows how long we'd have waited if that were the case.  The food was good but the service was so poor we will not return.  Also, they added on a 20% gratuity to our bill.  I seriously would not have given her a penny.  The all you can eat price is way too high!   So long Sushimono - you get a "F" in our book.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>Food is ok and the service was decent,  however this place was freezing cold with hard seats to sit on. I honestly felt like I was sitting outside on concrete during winter. The restrooms were dirty and smelled terrible and to make things worse they are right next to the kitchen. I will not be going back until this place cleans up.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< rate>

So apparently, you cant do all you can eat 2 hours before closing. Got there at 8pm and they close at 10. Our waiter said that you cant put in an order after 8. I smelled some Bull dung so we left, dont come to this place.<//review>

I don't know how this business can manage to stay open if they're gonna turn away good business well before closing...Business hours are from 11:30 am until 10:00 pm. Got there at 8:45pm, they initially refused to let us dine in, saying they were only taking take out orders (that's not what the sign says) then offered to let us get a table but by that time I was over it and insisted on getting the food to go.  There was a line of servers trying to close out their checks for the night at the register, there was someone sweeping vigorously around my boyfriend as if he didn't exist. Finally someone asked if he could be helped after us waiting for a good 30 minutes for our order. Our order had been done some time ago; not only had they forgotten about us, they asked us to prove we had paid already, like we just wanted to use their air conditioning or something.  While we were waiting they turned away probably 10 people who wanted to dine in; a party of 6, and a few couples. It was my birthday. Thanks though. Food was soggy by the time we got it home to eat.< /review>

<time>1510531474176<//time><review>Service was ok. The waitress didn't know how to light the grill and then turned it up too high and burnt all our food. The whole place including floors and tables are really greasy and slippery. Don't use the restrooms unless you absolutely have to, they are so foul smelling and floor is even greasier and dangerous to stand on. The cashier had no idea how to split out bill in half for the 2 families and it took over 20 minutes to pay. The Manager I believe came over and sorted it out whole shouting at the other employees very rudely. On top of it all, they added gratuity automatically, which I don't feel I should HAVE to pay with such poor service. Will not return!</review><Name>Elissa Didier<//Name>< userid>

Wow really????!!!!! The service was horrible!!!! I asked to be seated by the TV area to watch the game (730pm) and got denied said I can only set at the bar or at a table for 2 (my girlfriend and I) away from TV area....
I eat a lot of sushi been to many spots but I'm amazed how they are still open then have a bunch of 18yr Olds making rolls..... The sushi was disgusting lack of preparation.... I never write reviews but this time I had 2!!!! Hopefully it will save you and ur date or family the embarrassment.... I highly recommend their other location off sunrise.... Go there once a week to eat.... Never been disappointed....< /text>

My family and I came in an hour before closing and they refused to serve us because they decided to close the kitchen early. This is just bad business. Turning away paying customers during business hours. We will not be back. From looking at other people's reviews they make a habit of doing this. Crazy.< /review>

To be honest, this place has some great food( chicken teriyaki and California rolls), but the environment in which it is cooked is not one that is appealing at all. The machines in the kitchen look as if they have never been cleaned, and the tables as well as chairs are very sticky. The waiters are also kind of awkward to be honest, some seem as if they have had no experience at all.
Keep in mind, any roll that has crab in it will be imitation (cheap preservative) crab and not ACTUAL crab.< /Review>

Went to pick up an order for post mates, they said its going to be 30 minutes but took me 50 minutes since they gave one of the items on my order to someone else. Didn't even apologize for messing up. Instead one of the guys told the girl that it's ok to mess up since they were busy.</review>

Our server was so nice.  She earned the one star, But she was the only part of my experience that was delightful.
The first thing we noticed was our feet sticking to the floor all the way to the table.  It was really sticky.  As in, I could hear our shoes peeling off with each step.  The table was also sticky.  The bathroom was hideously filthy.  The crud was creeping up the wall, filthy.  You can see where the mop hit and the filth was flaking off in chunks.  The light grey tile was black, and it stinks.
Our water cups looked like someone had scraped the top across concrete at some point.  The plastic was rough and chipped.
My husband and I did the all you can eat sushi and bbq  option.  The menu for all you can eat is way too limited.  All the available rolls are spicy or fried.  Imitation crab is not acceptable for 23.95 per person.  Also, I'm not into cooking my own food if I go out to eat.  But, that's their thing.
The miso soup tasted like it came in powder form and was reconstituted.  The salad dressing?  It was straight up mayonnaise squirted out of a bottle.  The rice in the nigiri fell apart on every piece before I could get them to my plate or mouth.  The bbq tiger shrimp was marinated in the shell, which was way too messy.  Especially considering I had to use scissors to try and deveign them myself.  At the table.  With my fingers.  Gross.  The bbq beef was good, but if you give everyone scissors because the pieces are too big, make the pieces smaller.
My tummy was telling me to stop the torture at this point.  In fact, I found myself in the foul restroom before the check was paid.  I've eaten at places that made me sick before, and even gone back because it was just so tasty.  Bottom line is, this place doesn't offer anything worth the experience, so it's not worth the risk.  The food preparers had no hair nets, so it's not a shock I found hair in my hand roll.  Next time I see a CONDITIONAL PASS FROM THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT for employee hygiene/hand washing and food temperature ON THE FRONT DOOR, I will turn right back around and head somewhere else.  Like, anywhere else.< /text>

I took my dog to get groomed yesterday, when i picked him up, he had broken blood vessells in one eye leaving it completely red. he also had a large rash on his snout as if he had been scratched or struck on his skin. He was also displaying a very sad behavior after the grooming, do not recommend.<//review>

Our dog got a great cut and the price is reasonable but our appointment was for 3:30 (we were there) and they didn't get her done until 8 PM? I think 4 1/2 hours is a little long for a dog grooming? Don't think we'll be back!< /text>

Hair of the Dog was recommended to me by a family member. I brought my dog in and needless to say he looks brand spankin’ new!! There isn’t one hair out of place and his nails are perfectly cut as well. He will definitely be seeing Judy from now on:)<//text>

We had an amazing experience here. Our dog was uninvited to back to PetCo due to her reactions to getting her nails trimmed. We were scared to get them trimmed again but timidly brought her here. It was no problem whatsoever! Our dog was handled in an expert way and she gave them no problems at all. It was awesome! And all for $5.00! What a sweet deal!<//review>

<Text>Took two of my dogs in for grooming and when I picked them up, one of the dogs could barely open her eye. I took my dog to the vet the following day and found out, the groomed had hit my dog with something, causing me to spend over $300 to keep her from losing her eyesight. I do NOT recommend taking your dog for grooming. When we asked the groomed about her eye, she didn't provide an explanation.</Text>< Pics>

Have taken my animals here for a long time. She does a great job with all my dogs. I never carry cash on me and she doesn't take cards a payment, I just have to remember to grab money before I pick up.< /text>

<text>Whomever was walking the dogs for this salon was walking 7 dogs at once, half of them off leash in the parking lot. I had to rush across traffic to keep one small dog from getting hit by a car. The woman walking the dogs let me know that the dog I contained was “blind and I think she’s getting senile, that’s why she wandered off.” The woman then continued on her walk with 3 small dogs off leash.

I have no opinion on the quality of this salon’s services, but it certainly looks like they are willing to take big risks with the safety of the dogs in their care.<//text>< resp>

Food was good but the service was extremely slow! We waited for our food, for an hour and then another hour, for our to go order. And they never really came around to ask if we needed anything else.<//Text>

<text>Food takes way too long even on slow days... Waitresses are nice but their service is really slow. The food is mediocre and not the best, not tasty at all.... I asked for salt and pepper and they never brought it (on a slow day)... Overall I will pass on this restaurant. Also the crowd is ratchet, loud people, people burping, kids crying and yelling, etc., etc...< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80c290665921a437:0x76545cdc52fb5dac</GmapID></record>

<text>Honestly this place is not worth the food price. Service was terrible and the wait is approximately 40 mins ON A SLOW DAY... WTH... Parking is in the back... People burping, yelling, kids crying, ratchet as hell ... Food is not even tasty, popusas taste like they are frozen and re-heated...

The food is great, very delicious. My problem with the restaurant is the service. The waitresses take forever to take your order and to serve your food. Expect to wait about 10 to 15 minutes to take your order and 20 to 30 (if not more) minutes to have your food served. If you're looking for a place to eat that's quick to serve this is not the place you want to go to. But like I said, the food is really really good. So what I do is pre-order the food before I get there, that way by the time I'm there it's ready or about to be ready.<//Text>

Authentic salvadorian food all of a sudden right? I remember before it used to be mexican salvadorian restaurant just like some the other salvadorian restaurants I've seen in the valley.in the past I went there once back in the 90s and I I've noticed how the non latino customers always ordered Mexican food not knowing its NOT authentic mexican food which was when this place did not have as much customers as it does now.</Text>

They had a special on pupusas revueltas for 99 cents and they where decent size and tasted good. Most places tend to make them smaller when they on special but that was not the case here! I will definitely come again !<//review>

<Review>Bad service, mediocre food
My fruit drink tasted like refrigeration
Cream was rotten.
Also paid $17.00 for 2 $1.00 pupusas and an order of fried plantains and aryan fruit drink. Cash only and of course no receipt.
Place didn't have a pleasant smell.
But the service wins it all... horrible service at that.< /Review></record>

I've been to several salvadoran restaurants, and this is the only one who really has a great salsa for pupusas. Everywhere else, you get a tasteless thin red colored water they call salsa, but here, you get real salsa for pupusas, flavorful and thick, como en casa! I got chicharrón con queso pupusas and they're good. A bit pricey but hey, good things aren't cheap. Love it.<//review>

I only gave it 1 star because of the pupusas were good. Other than that the service was rushed, and when I asked for water they brought me bottled which I didn't ask for . And it took like 15 minutes just to get water in a cup. Mean while they brought the plates and no water until my husband asked them for it since the waiter was busy talking and giggling.
While I was there more people were stopping by and seating in open tables and I was seeing if they got their food faster yet I would only see 2 ladies if any . When we went to go pay we noticed that all the waitresses were busy washing all the dishes ahead of time instead of helping the people with their food . -_- sad . Went there once before and still had the same problem sorry not sorry.  Not going again.<//text>

We stopped here on our way home from Disneyland on Christmas day . We looked all over for someplace to eat and thankfully we stumbled upon this little place. Absolutely everything we had was very good. I had mar y tierra my wife and mother in law had pupusas. We all tried each other's food and we all agreed everything tasted great. I had steak and shrimp with rice, beans, salad and tortillas. My wife and mother in law had pupusas . The portions on my plate were larger than most places I've been to and the pupusas were fat. I wish this place was near my home in Northern California because I'd be eating here at least once a week. If I ever head down that way again I'm definitely stopping by again .< /Text>

Food was just average, portions are very small. If you get there before 10:30 a.m. they do have Huevos Rancheros for $4.99 though I'm told it's an even smaller portion than the regular version so you may have to order 2<//review>

Love the service. The pupusas are great. I've eaten at almost all of the pupuserias in the West & Central Valley and I can say this place is a hidden gem! Great quality.<//Review>

10.99 for a small portion of casamientos, 4 starchy pieces of platano, crema and 2 undercooked tortillas. It took about 20 minutes with no one ahead of me. Casamientos had a good flavor, but Tortillas were cold and undercooked.<//Text>

This is so disrespectful, Arely was my waiter and she gave me a wrong order, when I told her the mistake she was really disrespectful with me, and she didn't change my beverage.. I ask for a manager and she didn't tell her, so she didn't came to my table.. at the end she didn't finished to serve us.. she send another girl.. at the end she change the 2 pupusas with a really bad attitude...

What a episode!! 😭<//review>

<review>The worst experience left this place with a headache found hair in our food 2 different plates. One was a plate of Pupusas and one was empanadas. When I hold the waitress she acted like we did it on purpose so I asked to talk to a manager no manager in site nor they couldn't get a hold of him they gave me a 877 number that office was close. Worst place to go service sucks and food does to. Oh the cooks don't wear hair nets!!!< /review>< Pics>

Went for breakfast and the food was awful. Ham and eggs were greasy, got Mexican crema.
Asked the waitress for crema Salvadorena and she had the nerve to tell me that's what it was. It wasn't!!!

I have been here several times and every time i come here i leave very disappointed. If u plan on eating here, be ready to wait a while to get ur food. If u pick up they tell u that there is an hour wait for the pupusas when they are on special. I have call an hour and half and when i come to pick them up i still wait 30 to 45mins to get the order. The people here are very unorganized. They food is good but service is just horrible, but i dont blame them i blame the owners cause they can get more help but they are probably to cheap. Dont waist your time here.< /Text>

< Review>
The most Horrible experience ever!! Call and placed an order for pick up. Said it would be 1 hour, came in for my order and they told me 15-20 mins more! After 2 hrs they said 7 mins more! Cancelled my order!  Never coming back!! They don't even deserve 1star< /Review>

Food is great but setvice is aweful.  You need real, experiened waitresses.  Only one guy is not enough.  Necesitan mas meseras por favor. La espera es demasiado larga.</Review>

Osiris one of the workers of my chickadee pupuseria is rude and obnoxious with customers I think if she could slap customers.
Instead Ms Marlene is very cute and friendly.

(Translated by Google) They should change personnel, they are too passive to attend, if you ask for an order they tell you 45 minutes, you arrive and they still make you wait 45 more minutes, they are very bad at that.

(Translated by Google) I do not know why they have business if it is a lousy service, first and last time I go and I do not do propaganda or even if they pay me, the owner as she has money does not worry about taking care of the clientele, if she did not even have to pay to call clients, what a shame poor-minded people, that was a consumption of 20 people, and they put on their bows, but good mediocre employees in the same way as the owner.

(Original)
No sé porque tienen negocio si es un pésimo servicio,  primera y última vez que voy y no hago propaganda ni aunque me paguen,  la dueña como tiene dinero no se preocupa por cuidar la clientela, si no tuviera hasta pagara para llamar clientes, que lástima personas de mente pobre, eso que era un consumo de 20 personas, y se pusieron los moños, pero bueno empleados mediocres de igual manera que la dueña.</Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) Turnip, see that you wait half an hour for 4 pupusas purchased at the restaurant are shit. Nor that they were so good, the sauce seems salted water and tanning is very simple, knows soaked cabbage. I do not recommend it!!!!!...

(Original)
Del nabo, mira que hacerte esperar una hora y media por 4 pupusas compradas en el restaurante son chingaderas. Ni que estuvieran tan buenas, la salsa parece agua con sal y el curtido esta muy simple, sabe a col remojada.  No lo recomiendo!!!!!...<//text>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) Exaggeratedly, the service is very delayed, its quality has changed, since it has lost the flavor of the Salvadorian food when it started, and for the price that is paid, it should be better.

(Original)
Exageradamente, muy tardado el servicio, su calidad ha cambiado, ya que ha perdido  el sabor de la comida salvadorña de cuando se inicio, y por el  precio q se paga, deberia ser mejor.</Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) Food is ok. But waiting time ... takes about an hour to get your food after you order.
I always wait about an hour to receive the food after I order. With patience you eat well.

<Text>(Translated by Google) Much waiting. Too slow service. Not even in a large restaurant is the wait so long. They need more staff. They only serve one waitress for the large restaurant. Not going. Improve the service or lose customers. We will not be back. Even to collect is waiting. Amazing. Thanks but no Thanks

(Original)
Mucha espera. Demasiado lento el servicio. Ni en un restaurante grande es tanta la espera. Necesitan mas personal. Solo atieden una mesera para el restaurant tan grande. No va.

(Translated by Google) My visit to that place was the heaviest thing that I personally experienced as: heavy service, regular food, it takes to attend the customers, expensive food. Well, I do not recommend it to anyone.

<Review>Super super super shady people! They advertise the price of the car, I went down there and told them that I would buy it. They ran my credit and eventually said that they didn’t want to do the deal. Then they came back out, and said that they were going to take a risk on me, charged me 23% interest, and wrote up a contract. I said is there anything hidden that I need to know. They said there’s going to be tax, license, and gap insurance.  Then I had to come up with more cash down payment. I went to the bank immediately, came back and gave them all the money. They counted it and wrote up a contract. I went through the details very carefully with a fine tooth comb and could not believe my eyes. They added $1000 on top of the car price. Shady shady shady people. Had I not really gone over it with a really fine tooth comb I would’ve been totally ripped off. Unbelievable! You don’t do that to people and false advertising to top it off.<//Review><Name>Darren Elliott< /Name>< Response>

Be careful because they'll rip you off with high interest rates too. I purchased a vehicle last year and  unfortunately, I couldn't do anything to negotiate at the time because I was new to my job and my credit score wasn't the best. I also needed a car at the time. Luckily, I was able to fully pay it off before having to pay so much interest. I came back recently to check out a vehicle, but now with job stability and excellent credit score under my belt, but they wouldn't even budge on the price of the vehicle when I tried to negotiate! I mean not even a dollar. I've shown them that the same vehicle can go for less with even fewer miles! I kept coming back 2-3 more times for other vehicles and each time got worse. They kept telling me that they'll "lose profit", that doesn't make sense because they're making a hell of a lot of profit considering that the cars are used cars that they either win at auctions or taken as trade-ins ripping off other people. Never coming back here again. Stingy finance managers.<//text>< Time>

<text>Roadrunner auto group is by far the best car purchasing experience I've ever had. My sales person was Asher and he helped me and guided me to find my car. We communicated through emails and phone calls before I went into the lot. Asher was very nice, professional and friendly. He was very upfront about the pricing, the warranty and he made sure to explain me each detail of it. More than that, he answered all of my questions with extra patience. The best part was that i never felt pushed to make any decision about the purchase. Roadrunner auto Group has earned our business and I would recommend it to friends.< /text><username>Annette Garner< /username><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Text>I got recommendations from friends on this place so I took my cousin to buy her first car from them everyone was awesome and very helpful. We found what we were looking for right away because they really do have a big inventory of all types of cars. We are happy with the purchase and will be coming back for more thank you Roadrunner for making it so easy ☺️</Text>< Pics>

<text>Please consider this one star a "negative five star" review.  Note that there are not one or two isolated negative reviews for this fraudulent dealership, there is a trend.  Anyone considering doing business with this dealership should seriously reconsider.

This dealership embodies EVERYTHING that gives auto sales a bad reputation.  It is clear to me now that they will do and say anything to spend as little as possible while extracting as much of your money as possible.  The reliability of your vehicle and YOUR safety are not a concern.

In my case, they have not lived up to the terms of a legally binding contract and I cannot get them to respond.  Every single voice mail and email have gone without a single response.  Now I have to pursue legal action, wasting my time and money.  However, it is the principle of not wanting to let them get away with fraudulent business practices, so legal action it is.

Although there is the occasional positive review, I suspect they are either employees or friends trying boost their rating or the few customers that were lucky enough to not encounter a problem.  Please don't take your chances with this fraudulent dealer.< /text><response>None<//response><UserId.>110569603403215618657< /UserId.>< Date>

These guys are awesome! After trying to find a decent interest rate that wasn't stupidly high, Roadrunner was able to get me a 4.8% interest loan with Wells Fargo for a 2007 Ford Mustang GT. The car is in pretty good shape, needs to be detailed immediately. I've made an appointment with their service manager, David, to get my car detailed this weekend. THANKS!!< /review>

The car didn't even last one month before it broke down and the repairs were seriously expensive. They had a sticker that the car passed a smog check but there is no way it could've passed with a faulty exhaust/intake system. I will never buy another car from this lot and I won't send anyone else there to get rippes off.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<review>ROADRUNNER STOLE MY PERSONAL VEHICLE. Natalie and mason who works in the rental department of roadrunner colluded with an employee named VINCE to convince me that they could help me sale me car. Today they came and repossed the car I was renting and denied that that someone named VINCE ever worked there. Even after Natalie told me that Vince was her cousin. Guermo the manager told me last week Vince was fired. All I know is that Vince was an employee who promised to help me and possibly buy a car from roadrunner, and now no one knows where my personal vehicle is located or knows where Vince is located. IM CALLING THE POLICE ON THIS ENTIRE OPERATION! Veterans be warned! All military vets or active duty stay away from this place... CALLING THE COPS ASAP! Literally left with no car, the rental or my personal car that NATALIE, VINCE AND MASON STOLE FROM ME AND MY FAMILY! Lord have mercy on their souls!</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I would not buy a vehicle here. Cars are overpriced and sales people did not reflect as if they had full knowledge of their available vehicles or even an understanding of the cars they had in inventory. I requested to see an Infinity Qx50 the guys totally dismissed my request and was showing me a) other models b) other cars (none which resemble the Qx50) -I asked if they were willing to negotiate the price and could not get a formal response- I ended up purchasing a car elsewhere-< /Text>

If I could give a negative review I would. Please please please DO NOT BUY YOUR CAR from Road Runner.  I bought my 2010 Chevy Aveo in August, with less than 100k miles w Warranty GREAT DEAL RIGHT?  No. A lemon.  Since I've bought my car in August I've had to replace tires, gone in after a week of purchasing because the AC stopped working, shocks, and now I'm having transmission issues.  Road runner is no where to be found in regard to their warranty that was SUPPOSED to cover transmission/ engine issues.  I'm disappointed in their service.  They knowingly sold me a bad car. PLEASE DO NOT BUY ANY CAR FROM HERE THEY SHOW INCORRECT CARFAX and all their cars will have issues, they’ve all been in accidents, or something happened to them, and no one wants these< /Text>

<review>I was interested in a vehicle there. I was told if I show proof that a loan check was being mailed to me they would mark the car as sold. I got a loan for the car was about to get that day when I got a call that it was sold last night. I would not use this dealer ever unless u want to lose money. I am now paying fees for paying off a loan early. That was very unprofessional thing to do, if I was the owner I would have a good word with the managers because they're giving your dealership a bad name.<//review>< Pics>

This place is terrible. They were extremely nice when they sold me a car with blown head gaskets. But once I caught the issue before the 30 day warranty was up they became rude and condescending. They even made me pay for half of the repairs in which I requested a signed warranty for.
After the car broke down again, I had my own mechanic do a full diagnostic on the car. Roadrunner reassembled the car wrong. When I showed the issues to them and supplied my warranty which should've covered the issue, they said the warranty ONLY covers the head gaskets and not the engine. How can you take my engine apart but not be held accountable for making a mistake putting it back together? They didn't stand by their product and displayed extreme unprofessionalism by lieing once major issues were found in the car they sold me. A $10,000 car. Many used dealerships manipulate one's ignorance of law and/or basic car shopping in general. Road runner was by far my worst experience ever...<//text>

Worst dealership ever. Nothing about buying a car was easy. It has been 4 months since I brought my vehicle and I am still dealing with them. From two dead car batteries with three weeks of buying led me to get the 3rd battery fitted else where. Then, after paying for warranty on the car, I received a letter from the warranty company saying the dealership never completed the payment of the contract so the warranty has been cancelled. They never return calls or emails and to get an answer takes days. It is painful. Do not come here.</Text>

Regardless on your credit as long as you have a job, they will get you into a vehicle. People who expect too much out of a dealer are insane for not being realistic on all of their comments by posting irrelevant remarks. Never the less, they still treat  you like you should be great, almost like a family. Since it is a family owned, you become one. Like I said, all you need is a job to get you into a car that's about it. Come and ask for George Gurolla, the finance guy. He's the man who can make it happened for you. Thanks, George for all your great help that you've done for me...by the way can I get a job there with you to be your Boss...? HEHEHE! 👍<//text>< rate>

I have never dealt with such unprofessional shysters. They knowingly sold me a lemon and "misplaced" my warranty papers making me wait an additional 45 days for them to validate. Upon attempting to return the lemon I was made to wait an hour just for the manager to show up. Then a very rude man who refused to give me his name after asking how much money I had brought with me, stormed out of the office angry after telling him he'd sold me a lemon. Another employee told me this angry rude man was the general manager and still wouldn't give me his name. After waiting an additional 30 minutes for the man who had actually sold me the car.< /review>

I dodged a bullet. Test drove the car and was already iffy about it. The deal they gave me was a little high so I gave them a number I was comfortable with. They said OK and then when I'm signing the paperwork I notice, without the finance guy mentioning anything, that they have changed the finance terms to 60 months instead of 48 months. Thank god I noticed it because I was just about to sign it. Very unprofessional and dishonest.< /Review>

< Review>
In my opinion.. DO NOT BUY FROM HERE.. This is the absolutely has to be WORST dealership on the face of planet.. I bought an Expedition from here and the first week i had it the check engine light came on along with clanking noises from the engine. I took it back to them and they claimed they fixed it. THE FIRST DAY I GOT IT BACK THE SAME THING HAPPENED but this time it shut off completely.. Keep in mind i live 100 miles away from this place so im missing work and and burning fuel from two cars going back and forth to this place.. So I TAKE IT BACK AGAIN.. this time they provided a crappy rental car  and the CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON LOL... The last time I got it back "WHICH TOOK 3 MONTHS TO FIX" they were able to keep the check engine light from coming on, but they EMPTIED THE FUEL TANK just to ad insult to injury . Months later the check engine light comes back on this time with a fury of the same shaking and rattling.. I finally gave up on it and sold the car after taking a huge loss.. AN Absolute nightmare scenario, countless hours of driving back and forth and tons of money shelled out just to fix the stupid thing. I felt compelled to warn the public of my misfortunes with this company, and i hope many of you read this and save yourself the heartache. Don't be fooled by the sly talk of the salespeople  or there ripoff financing agreements. This place is just a complete swindlers coup and ripoff... Again as i said earlier.. whatever you do.. DO NOT BUY FROM HERE.. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED... At this point if you buy from this place you just must like gambling or something. Because that's exactly what your doing when you buy from this place..<//Review>

< Review>
I have bought and sold many cars over my lifetime, and always was able to develop a great experience with both dealer and private party transactions.
However, 2-weeks ago my wife and I began looking for a car for our 3rd. son and here comes the experience we
encountered at Roadrunner.

We were first greeted by Elizabeth, nice lady who wouldn't allow you to get a word in edgewise. Didn't know her inventory, but figured her gift to gab could cover anything up. Next we met a nice you man, David who was trying to help us next. Great kid, but had no idea what cars and features the lot had.
(I actually feel sorry for him, as he is new to the used car business and not working with a group of people I would refer to my worst enemy)

So after doing OUR research as to there inventory, we found a Ford Escape. It seemed nice A/C not working but figured we could talk about that.

We agreed on a price and because it was a weekend and the A/C needed to be fixed,and a tear in the back seat. we agreed after doing the paperwork and giving an$500.00 deposit, that the vehicle would be delivered to Thousand Oaks 3-days later.(this was a all cash purchase)

Then the nightmare began.
I called on Mon. To make sure we were on track, The answer was Yes.
Then I called Tues AM. Same question, same answer. Everything done-answer yes. And that we would be meeting as planned later that day in T.O.
I then called at 6pm to triple check and again answer then oh mechanic hadn't signed off on repair yet. (When are they ever calling me? Answer-NEVER)
So plan then was for Weds night. More calls again from me to then Weds. AM.
Answer again yes everything ready to go.
So my wife and I drive down to Thousand Oaks as planned...again I call at 6 to reconfirm and again another half ass explanation as to why car is still not ready. I then tell them one more chance, but now I want the car delivered to Ventura on Thurs. 3:00 pm. Answer, sounds great.
I leave work to meet them, 3:30,3:45 nothing so I call for now probably the 10th time to find out what's going on and the answer is something still isn't ready. These people are just liars. Needless to say, after this fiasco I called to cancel the deal and got more run around to get my 500.00 back.

Anyway, eventually got my 500.00 back, but again with much hastle.
In the end found a great used car days later with no problems

<Review>DO NOT buy from this dealer my experience is horrible they promise you things so you would buy from them.

Months later they transferred the car payments to ABS i try to get intouch and found out they dont make credit .bad reputaion and rude people.dont waste your time.</Review><rating>1<//rating></record></dataset><record>

Here is a quick breakdown of their dirty deeds:
They never paid off my trade-in but they made sure to sell it to someone else. They sold a car they didn't even have the title to then made that poor person bring it back to the dealership (three months later) once I pointed out their misdeeds. Fraud much? Now they are trying to extort me by saying I need to remove my bad review in order for them to "help" me. I think not.

I signed for my car July 5th. Two months later I have actually had it in my possession approx. 4 weeks - at intervals. They say they will fix the many problems, they don't. The refuse to provide copies of work orders till you use the word LAWYER. Last time they had my car for SEVENTEEN (17) days and w/in two days of getting it back we had all the same probs. The only reason they even gave it back was because they wouldn't tell me where the car was being worked on and when it might be done - I finally had to say I'd call the cops to report it stolen since they couldn't produce my car.

These guys are good at the following:
Lying.
Condescending.
Playing games.
Selling crappy cars.
Lying.
Not fixing things.

Example: "I'd like you to send my car to an actual dealer to have it fixed. Your guys have tried twice and failed. I can't be without a car anymore."

Their response: "Oh, no, honey, that won't happen. I guarantee you, the dealer will be at LEAST $1,000 just to lift the lid. At least."

Me: "Really? That's interesting. I just spoke to them and they said it would be $149 to get under the hood and diagnose the problem."

Before my second car payment is even due, I was on the freeway, in the fast lane, when the transmission when out and the brakes failed. I had to sit on the side of the road with my foot on the brake because even w/the car off and the parking brake engaged, the car still wouldn't stop. I was nearly hit by a big rig as I tried to exit the freeway in my disabled car.

I now have to deal with a lawyer, superior court, I had to open a case with the DMV and Bureau of Automotive Repair. I will probably have to file bankruptcy because they never paid off my trade and the lemon the sold me was repo'd by their shady finance company after I told them I wasn't going to pay for a car I'd just bought but was already in pieces at the Mercedes dealer and the cost to repair the damage inflicted by Roadrunner's incompetent staff was more than the car is worth.

All they do is lie and rip people off. If you buy from them after reading this review then you have nobody to blame but yourself.<//text>

This dealer its very unprofesional. As soon as i got there i can tell the cars were not even washed. Then a bmw that i wanted to see would not even start after i told them i we ould be there at 6. Typical mikey mouse used suits used dealer type. It doesnt inpire you to drop a few grand after the sales person has gang tattoos on their hands and starts fighting with the other for not charging the battery.</Review>

This "business" has to be one of the worst places I have ever dealt with. I purchased a car in April of 2014. Looked nice but after 2 days I was already having problems. I took it back and was told they would look the car over and fix the issue. After speaking with the sales dept i was also told i would not have to pay for anything that needed to be fixed since i had only had the car 2 days. Turns out the drive shaft and radiator needed to be replaced. When i picked up the car i was told i had to pay $1400. To their convenience they didnt remember telling me i didnt have to pay and i ended up paying half. The check engine light came on again a couple days later and i was told by the service manager he cleared the computer but the light kept coming on so he figured it was faulty and told me to ignore it. 5 months after that my car went into the shop for over $1500 worth of problems. I was also told by my mechanic that i need to have the cadaletic converter replaced thats about $2000. About a month after that the radiator needed to be replaced again (the one i just paid to be replaced by them 6 months ago). After that was replaced the head gaskets need to be replaced. While my mechanic was tearing my engine apart he tells me they have already been replaced but not replaced correctly. I called Road Runner to ask what work was done on the car before i purchased it. They tell me that they cannot find any paper work on the car at all. No paper trails to what they did or did not do. No paperwork of any inspection done by them on the car prior to me buying it. The extended warranty i purchased through them will not cover anything. I was told they will contact the rep for Alpha Warranty and have him call me. I have yet to hear anything. I cannot express enough the frustration of dealing with this. To use my hard earned money to buy a car and be so scr**** over.</Text>

< review>
If youre looking for a car dealership in the san fernando valley, moreso a warehouse, there are two options, drive all the way to Sun Valley, or remain in the trafficless west sfv. Roadrunner auto sales has a lot of cars to choose from within my price range (under 4k), although the less price you go after the less condition of the car. I dont know about their financing but if you are a cash buyer this is the place. Ignore the staff, go online find something and go there and test drive.</review>

<Review>Bait and switch!  No online advertised price is true to their in-person offer. They are very dishonest. "Waiting game" is when the leave you alone at a desk for long periods of time to wait you out. Also,  unneeded "GAP" insurance. Sales manager and Hummer (salesman) are actually very dishonest. Over all terrible experience. Don't buy here<//Review>< gmapID>

<text>I bought a BMW Z3 2.5 years ago from Roadrunner, I should have known from day one that I was going to have trouble with this car, as it broke down on the way home from the showroom, to date I have spent $8500 on repairs for this vehicle, yes it was quick and easy to purchase from them but their customer service after the event is awful,</text>< pics>

This is my Go-Too and they know where things are. I have purchased all my backyard things there and the service from every employee is awesome! Of course I will go back, weekly at least once. Im content to pay more for great service and support.<//Review>

Such a great store and wonderful service! I looked at 3 different Home Depot’s and 2 different gas stations for a propane tank but no luck. I found this place at the last minute and a gentleman named Pat was beyond helpful getting me my gas and some other things too. Definitely coming back again!</Review>

Went in today and bought a drill and the employee, didn't catch his name but he had the coolest irish accent, helped me out and recommended a drill bit set to buy that was on sale. So we got two great deal items and the best customer service. Definitely will come back to this one again!< /Text>

Decent store. Different inventory from the big box places.  There is definitely a need for smaller hardware stores like this. I'll be back.</text>

< Review>
This is the worst store ever. My husband made an online order, he received a confirmation email saying it was ready. He came to the store and they said it didn't arrive, he came back 4 days later and the item still didn't arrive. No one has taken responsibility for their negligence, my husband still doesn't have his item and ace has our money and refuses to do a refund. This place is a joke. Lynne is the worst employee this place has.</Review>

<Review>People are nice and helpful, easy place to go if you need a part to fix something around the house.
I've found that during the week I can get help finding and getting things. On the weekend it can be hard to get around and impossible to get help. They had no problem taking things back when I got the wrong item.</Review>< pictures>

To Joshua, you hung up on me after 2 and a half hours listening to you complain about how busy it was. Thanks for the entertainment though, my whole office at WeWork enjoyed listening in!<//review>< Pictures>

You can always find what you need from ACE Hardware stores. We were greeted at the door right away to assist us. This one had a huge supply of Green egg products along with their other hardware items. We even found some unique items not normally found, like unfinished oak strips to make bars, tables, and other wood crafts. Not sure it is an item normally stocked though. The item we were looking for was not there but, their sales people were glad to lend a hand and try to order it.....<//review>

Great store with helpful friendly and knowledgeable staff.  This is what a hardware store should be. Selection is varied but limited compared to a box box store but for weekend project this place is perfect for everything you need.<//text>

No they don't have hundreds of kinds of PVC or a quarter inch left handed nail splitter but so far they have had 100% of what I need for my everyday chores and repairs. And I don't have to walk a half mile to get to the part of the store that has the side cutters I came there for.</Review>< pictures>

I love this store, but the owner really needs to turn on the air conditioner in the store when the temperature is in the mid 90's. Not just for the customers, but show that you care for your employees! Have a heart!!<//Review>

The store is well stocked and organised and the staff is so polite and helpful. I don't need to spend on gas and time to go all the way to the other part of the town for quality hardware.
Went for the grand opening and grabbed a bunch of stuff for discount. Anything that fits into their bucket ... What a concept. Thank you again.< /review>< time>

Went in approximately 3 weeks ago on a Sunday. Has not known there was a new Ace on blossom hill, asked if the did screens for windows the cashier I spoke to Morgan said yes dropped off one of my other screens got a due date in 5days waited a day after to call 3 screens that we had paid $135 for were not even started on spoke to Scott the person whom answered the phone he apologized and after talking back and forth to his manager they came to the conclusion that the store was too busy to do anything in regards to having them done that week added another 7days. Again no call came in was in the area went in and again nothing was even started on. The manager on dirty some lady all she was worried about is who took my order initially I told her to check the invoices and why did it matter it was not a problem of an order being taking down wrong I mean I gave them a 2nd chance to give great customer service. When small businesses fail they blame it on big box stores maybe it's the employees you hire. We are paying more to get that one on one feeling so that the job gets done right. Never going back<//Text>

<text>I surprised to see Ace Hardware in the corner here but, there it is!!
Well organized and looks like it's well-run attentive staff and very well-stocked.
OSH is my first choice, as always, even though it's little bit more expensive than your typical hardware store.  But, Ace is my goto backup when OSH cannot come through.

Take a peek they're really good prices and they might be able to get you something with someone actually pay attention to you!< /text>< pics>

The baristas say, “Expresso” instead of, “Espresso” drives me bonkers but great place. Clean etc etc.</Text>

I loved the outdoor seating. Parking is down the street--directly behind the store is for the banking institution only so watch signage. The baristas were super friendly and helpful when I was trying to order tea and could not remember what type I usually get.<//review>

I brought my own cup and ordered tea and the gentleman put the tea bag in my cup, and then filled a paper cup with hot water complete with cup sleeve and plastic lid and handed both to me.  YOU LOSE AGAIN ENVIRONMENT.< /Review>

This one in Montrose is on a corner and gets a lot of traffic because it has seating inside and out.  Accessible from one entrance via a ramp.   Great mix of people and free parking nearby.  They share their parking with other stores.  I love their tea and they have a good variety.  Their coffee is also pretty good, particularly the House Blend.  This location is in downtown Montrose with banks, stores and restaurants nearby.  Very easy to see in traffic.< /text>

Good coffee, nice staff, great, very comfy seating. Has a nice seating area. The perfect place to get coffee and hang out with friends or someone special. The only objection I have is that I’ve heard that the employees are apparently a bit overworked or underpaid, given how unhappy they seem with management, which is a bit of an ethically important issue for me, so I’m giving this three stars for an excellent coffee place that just needs to treat its workers better!</Text>

<text>Consider yourself a rare rainbow unicorn if you manage to grab a table at this place. I've been here a dozen times it is ALWAYS full of laptop table hogs each killing a 4 top each. I've managed to sit inside once. The patio usually has a few tables free if you like sitting in direct sunlight. The leather easy chairs inside look like they come from a thrift shop, worn out and gross, and the low patio chair cushions outside are worn, flattened and should have been thrown away years ago. Other than that its your typical CBTL.< /text>< rate>

Great, big seating area, but close parking is somewhat a nightmare. Although free parking is somewhat nearby. Everyone is super friendly and nice! Our iced tea is perfect on this hot day, however EZ ice is not understood. I seem to have extra ice...<//Review>

My wife and I stop in there for coffee several times per week during our morning walk. The baristas are very friendly and it has a very comfortable atmosphere. The pastries are OK , the coffee is good and the wifi is excellent (as it should be in a coffee shop). There is also very convenient seating outside if you want to be outdoors.</text>

Indoor and outdoor seating, right next to the very quaint walkable Montrose Village. I have to say though, and this applies to many coffee places, that the free WiFi has promoted many to "plant" themselves at a table for hours, having maybe a cup or two of coffee, but preventing others from seating down. Perhaps these businesses should have a WiFi time limit, or just charge for it, we should all be able to seat down and enjoy it, not everyone needs to be connected 24/7.< /text>< rating>

Great service, great location.
Seating is sometimes iffy, but folks are willing to 'squeeze' you in.< /Text>

I don't mind that the workers can wear whatever they want, but it does bother me that they don't wear hats. Specially some of the workers with messy hair style or out of control hair styles. They should wear hair net or something when dealing with people's food. I had to throw away my food after employee gave it to me just cause her hair was hanging down towards my food. No good.< /Text>

I recently got my nails done this past Sunday. I was pleased with how my nails looked when I left until literally the next day two of my nails were lifting. I went back and got them fixed, I tried asking if I can get them all done again and offered to pay for it. But instead they only did the two nails and then the next day another one was lifting and missing acrylic. Do Not come here. I have never experienced this before with acrylic.< /Review>

This was my first time trying this place. I got a full set here and within a week they broke. I don’t know why, but a week and half later I decided to get a fill with them to see if that would help. They broke the next day. A week and a half later I took all my nails off and decided to get a full set because I thought maybe it was just that set. It has been less than a week and 4 nails broke. I was drying my hands and one just popped off! They don’t even hurt when they break! I get my nails medium to long in length, but never have they broken like this. I am never wasting my money here again. They use cheap products that don’t last.< /review>

<Text>Service from the nail lady that was doing my nails was HORRIBLE. She did not care if she was hurting me and didn’t take her time. They came out lumpy and uneven. The manager was able to accommodate me and had me go back in to get them fixed. (Still have to go in )  The two stars are for her horrible service and unsatisfied work. She was also standing next to me when I was paying waiting for a tip! When she heard me ask if I can leave a tip on my card she just walks away without saying anything. I don’t think I heard her speak the entire time.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Was in a rush.. gel paint left on skin not good of a job.. they also charge for extra color of gels if y want glitter its $10 extra , i been doing gel for awhile and not once in orange county they charge extra.. ridicolous just because this was something open late. Will not recommend this place....they couldnt even do a pedicure because the chairs where taken and have to come back another day... i told her i go somewhere else....< /review>

I gave them one too many chances and my nails look sloppy nearly every time I come here; they tend to rush through it, don't paint the entire nail & rarely bother to put enough coats of the polish. Also, if I'm paying for you to do my nails I would appreciate you focusing on doing the job & not talking on the phone!! Common courtesy. Im going to start taking my business elsewhere from here on out.</review>< Pictures>

< review>
Went in here because my nail lady was unable to fit me in last minute and I needed my mani urgent for Friday. Had been here couple of times throughout the years and they have done a good job. Was getting my mani by a short male and after like 3 min of doing my nails asked if I knew what color i wanted. I literally had no idea because their gel selection is horrible. He gave me a big ole speech of getting powder instead of gel to which i said no thank you. He then took me over to the pedi chairs and sat me down to get a pedi and I noticied that they dont cover with plastic where you soak your feet, which I thought ok gross but Im already getting a mani done. An older tall man came and started taking off color and then asked if I know which color and I said no and asked if they had other selections and said no only more selections for powder. More obvious that they wanted to sell me powder which i didnt want, i get a many and pedi and always change color. Then he proceeds to tell me ask me if I want the same color. Honestly i didnt understand him. Again  he asked me another two times, finally i understood him and i said no and both men started laughing. between these times they started talking in their language. Which everyone knows that talk in their language to talk about their customers, lets be real. I said no thank and he told me pick a color. I was honestly in shock and so tired I had no idea how to react. Would not have been so nice if I wasnt tired. I said you know what dont do my pedicure thank you. He stood up super dramatic oh ok! and the man doing my mani was like hes joking. I simply stood up as the manager was approaching me and walked out. I work with customers all day and literally had no idea why he was being rude simply because I wasnt ready with their ugly selection of colors. I will NEVER be back here! I get that you work late but then maybe dont work until 9pm if your going to be rude to customers because then it looks bad for the business that you of course dont own. Went to another place at the mall and got them done with no problem and they did a good job. All for waiting till last minute and not see my awesome nail tech at creative salon near the movies. Never again!!!</review>

< Review>
I can't believe I have been going here for a while now I love how fast and professional they are but now I am upset I just got my nails fills done on 2/27 and my pinky nail is ALREADY FALLING OFF and its 3/3 I came in to get it REPLACED and they think I'm going to be ok to just put nail glue NO WAY I PAY GOOD money and my nail lady I have never had a problem but they tell me that they are too busy come back later no way because my nail is falling off they should HONOR to replace it without me waiting its only been 4 days and its falling off the manager I didn't think was professional</Review>

<Text>I got my nails done here. I like that they had a seat available as soon as I got there. Color of the nails came out really nice!! Shape of the nails were okay. I know it can’t be perfect. My disappointment came afterwards when I had time to get over the gorgeous coloring work. And noticed the spacing between my skin and the fake (acrylic)nails. It looks like I need a refill already on the first day. I got the acrylic nails and I know they try to get as close as they can but this ish is unbelievable. I’m supposed to go to a wedding with my new nails but  they look like I’ve had them for a week or more. My real nail is very visible from all sides and it looks like I did them. Just really bad work. I looked past the shape and the pain but this is horrible work. Now I know why it took them very little time to finish. Because they used very little nail material to do my nails. Not recommending this place and not going back ever again.< /Text>< gmapID>

Awful! Nails break really fast and they don’t care to fix them. If you want your nails to last more than one week I don’t recommend going here. They overcharge for very poor quality products. I went total of 3 times because i thought maybe it was just the set i had got but no, it’s just the products.< /text>

She told me she's been doing nails for 20 years it seems like she did it in a rush and she wants to get you out of there as soon a possible. I also asked for matte nails and they didn't come out matte at all they have a gloss that's not work 38 dollars im so mad and dissapointed<//review>< Pictures>

This place sucks!!!! Broken chair, no massage. Hubby bought me a certificate for my BDay, came in for a Pedi and I was literally finished 15 mins after I sat down.  Nancy was not only rude and way too rough, but totally gave attitude, rolling her eyes and everything bad I didn't want the "wrap" tx (which I might have gotten, had she been a little nicer).  Point blank, I love and appreciate my husband's intentions, but I will NEVER come here again. Save your money and do it yourself......
So disappointed.<//Text>

The worst nail salon I've ever been too. The nail tech even got upset when I asked for short acrylic nails. Trust me girls, don't go here. Its not worth the money.</Text>

You will not find a better vet anyplace. The staff is friendly, helpful and always on top of things. The small animal vet, Dr. Bear, is an amazing guy. He is so good with our cats, I feel completely at ease when we visit. We first met him when I called to inquire about getting our goat's feet trimmed and he came out to the house and did a remarkable job. We have been loyal customers ever since. A bonus is the clinic is in Blossom Valley it's always quiet and peaceful. The waiting area is outdoors, in the shade, great place to hang out. They also throw an annual Christmas party with food and live music for their customers!</review>

We saw Dr. Aaron Harlan for our three new goat babies for vaccines and castration.  We are new to owning goats as pets and Dr. Harlan was fantastic!  He was patient, very informative, answered every question we had, showed us what to look for in goats and how to trim their hooves.  So happy we have a local vet who understands livestock as pets!<//Text>

<Name>Just Me< /Name><Date>1622131424322<//Date><rate>1</rate><Review>We have been going to them for years and loved them.  But they've become so popular now that their old clients suffer for the sake of all the new people.  You have to book weeks in advance, so that pretty much limits it to strictly routine work - if you have a problem or an emergency, you're on your own.  No consideration for long-time patients whatsoever. That is no way to run a veterinary office.  I'm looking elsewhere.< /Review>< Pictures>

I have used them in the past for my goat and they were great. This time i took my dog to be spayed. The price was great for how large and what was done. She was treated great and happy when picked up. Definitely would use them again.< /review>

My 12 year old Rescue had 2 infected teeth removed. Everything went well and Dr. Chrystal was very responsive and thorough in the procedure. I recommend this practice to anyone. They are very professional and kind.<//Text>

First time at ECLAP - fantastic experience. We left our old vet after the practice switched hands and we weren’t happy with the quality of service.

From the start- our vet tech was very professional and had a demeanor that made me feel like this practice had their act together. She took my pack into the office with confidence and control.

After their checkup, Dr. Christel came out to talk to me. Even though she is young, this veterinarian is extremely knowledgeable. She answered all of my questions in plain English.  I’m very happy with the service we got and I’ve found my new vet!< /Review>

<rate>5< /rate><text>My first time at ECLAP.  . . I arrived an hour early for my appointment (my mistake), but they were very friendly and told me to wait.  I did not wait long until my dogs were taken back.  The vet met with me after their exams and went through each dog individually.  I had inquired about teeth cleaning for both dogs and was told only one needed it.  I appreciate them being honest and not performing services that are not necessary.  Overall, it was a good experience.  I had to wait several weeks to get my appointment.  I hope in the future that if they need to be seen for something more urgent that I am able to get in.</text>< Pics>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>This is our first visit to this Vet. I have a small dog and he did great. Thank you to Vet Rebecca and Kelly. Kelly was kind and made an effort to comfort Bear before his Exam and shots. Vet Rebecca answered all my questions and explained things I hadn’t thought of. She’s fantastic!  The cost of this visit was
less than I expected. Our previous Vet was so expensive compared to our new Vet. An example: Bear has appointment with our new Vet for his teeth next month and the old Vet estimate was double that amount. Check them out!</Review>< Pictures>

We've been bringing our pets for their 6-7 years now, & they now have no availability for right away needs like they used to, & referred us to El Cajon walk in place. I've referred people to go here & will no longer do so because of this. You should always leave open spaces for right away needs of your current patients or hire vet that is there for that specifically. Very disappointed now.</review>

I've had animals all my life and interacted with many vet clinics.  Most have been really good but the entire staff and the care provided, to our family pets, by Dr Christel and Vet Tech Irene, has been EXCEPTIONAL each time!

Highly recommend!!< /review>

So glad we made the move to ECLAP!  The staff is so pleasant and patient. The Drs. have been wonderful. Explain everything before procedures, keep in touch during surgeries, and are very thorough with aftercare instructions. I have witnessed other patients arrive with an emergency and they were dealt with immediately and with compassion. The practice is very busy but appointment scheduling is reasonable. A+ on all fronts. I know are cat and dog are getting the best care possible. Thank you ECLAP!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️<//Review>

This was our first time to this veterinarian clinic. The Vet tech and doctor both came out to speak to me, even though I could not go in and both were very patient with my dog who was very excited and full energy. My dog has not run in over 2 weeks and he pulled on his leash but the vet tech was very patient and did not rush him. They were on time and thorough and the value of care for the price was exceptional. Bonus is the location is set on this beautiful ranch and farm and it feels like Dr Doolittle which seems how all vets should feel.</Text>

<Review>My dog had ACL surgery on her back leg in September and now needed her opposite leg ACL repaired. The only problem was my vet I found out is no longer practicing and taking my dog somewhere new to get surgery was really scary and stressful. After talking to a handful of friends I decided to try ECLAP and could not be happier with my experience! We’re on day 2 of her recovery and she has been eating, drinking and going to the bathroom like normal which was not the case last time at all. The entire staff is so friendly, helpful and their compassion and love for animals is very obvious. What more could you want as a pet owner?! I 100% recommend ECLAP!<//Review>< Date>

With what I thought was our last good byes with our Little dog, and thinking we were going to have to put her down due to what appeared to be a tumor, Dr. Manring spent the time to evaluate and decided we would treat her rather than just putting her down and I’m glad. Our precious little dog is doing fine. What I thought was a tumor just turned out to be an infection and was diagnosed properly. Dr. Manring did not mess with our emotions (like many other Veternarian’s) yet calmed us by letting us know all of our options up front. Not once did she mention money during the evaluation like I had received at every other Veternarian that I have had to deal with in the past (other locations).

East County Large & Small Animal Practice Is very professional and caring. I will continue to use them for all of our animal care needs. I will recommend them to everyone...

Thank you Caitlin, you saved my dogs life!<//text>

The rate for what we had done was great!
We also met the Vet, Dr Oman!

Very nice and professional!

He called every step of the way for my Darby’s surgery!

The staff that we talked to were very nice as well!

I have an appt. booked already to have my kitten spayed for next month!

Would highly recommend this Vet hospital!

Thank you to all the staff and Doctor’s at ECLAP!❤️🐕🐈❤️</Review>

Very happy we decided to go to ECLAP for a second opinion for our dog. The staff and Doctor(s) were SO kind, their prices are INCREDIBLE, and the location is great. So clean and animal friendly, we felt right at home. We are definitely making ECLAP our new permanent vet office! It's about a 40 minutes travel for me, but WELLLLL worth it! :)< /Text>

Caitlin was amazing. We left with my kids saying she could be one of the family. Caitlin took care of our badly injured baby alpaca in an emergency situation. We didn't know where else to go so from San Diego's North County to East County took over an hour but Caitlin took AMAZING  care of us and our baby. I will gladly go the hour to see her again!!!! Thank you!!!!</text>

<review>We have had a couple of our animals go here (pot belly pig and goat.) This past weekend a couple of our chickens were very sick and it was a Sunday.  We were able to make after hours call and spoke to vet.  We drove to El Cajon and pick up medications for the girls.  We would have lost them had it not been for ECLAP.  We are a few days into the medication and the girls are feeling much better and back to happy, healthy chickens.<//review>< Pics>

<Text>They are all amazing! I took my 2 year old Great Dane in to get fixed yesterday and they went above and beyond! Cleaned his ears, trimmed his nails, gave him all the love and cuddles and helped me wrangle Him into my car and took him on the side entrance bc he isn’t used to other dogs he doesn’t know. The best experience ever never ever taking my animals

I know it might seem bonkers that this place has such  a great score but once you’re here you understand why. The staff, even at their busiest, check in on those who are waiting and then hurry off to give their full attention to whichever client is next. You can tell there’s an effective system in place to handle the rush of appointments. Sure, if you’re here during their peak time, you might be waiting for a moment but the proof is in front of you with how hard they’re working! Each pet is greeted with a genuine smile. Their prices are fair and I never walk away feeling cheated. Props to this team! Thanks for being here for our furry family members :)< /text>

We brought our mini dachshund Delilah here to get spayed and had a great experience. All the staff were incredibly friendly and made a scared little weenie dog feel comfortable. I received a call once she was in surgery letting me know that she was doing well . We will now be switching both our dogs to this facility. I highly recommend ECLAP.< /Review>

WOW!!!!!!!  My wife and I have been to many vets over the years.  Yesterday, we took our 2 Dachshunds to ECLAP for the first time.  And I can tell you without a doubt, we have just found our Forever Vet!  Dr. Bear and Irene, Wow, Wow, Wow!  So caring, understanding and professional!  Employees that are passionate about what they do and genuinely listen to your thoughts and concerns you may have about your pets.  I can't even tell you how impressed we both are. :)  My wife and I left talking about how well we were taken care of and treated all the way home!  Just a great first time experience! We can't wait to return and have the satisfaction of knowing our little pups will be taken care of by the staff at ECLAP!  Thank you thank you!< /Text>

I was able to get our dog seen within two and a half hours of my phone call. I was treated with respect and my baby(dog) was not hesitant at all to go with one of the techs that came to get her from the car. They were so sweet and nice with my baby. They kept me informed of everything as they were doing it. The Vet came out to speak with me twice to let me know that my baby was doing great and to talk with me about a treatment plan and then when she was all done to talk about the plan at home. WOW!!! I feel like I hit the jackpot, This clinic is fantastic. The office staff worked so hard to do everything for my baby and they genuinely cared about her. This was my first visit here and I know they will be there if I need them again!!!< /review>

Best Vet ever.  I have been to too many vets and been over charged for services they scare you into because if you don't , you feel like a bad dog owner.  ECLAP is amazing.  They are conservative with what they suggest and they do an amazing job.  They are trust worthy and the letting is great and not scary for my dogs!<//review>

Dr. Omar has been treating our horses for a while, I believe he even delivered out older horse. He is very caring with the horses. I also like that he explains everything thoroughly and answers all of our questions.
I would recommend Dr. Oman and anyone on the ECLAP team.< /text>

<Text>Dr. Manring and the entire team at ECLAP have never let me down. Anytime I need an appointment, whether it is an emergency or a routine visit they are always available for me. Dr. Manring’s professionalism, knowledge and empathy that she expresses to her clients is second to none. She showed my family, myself, and my beloved horse Tanner so much love and dignity in his final hours. She also never hesitates to answer any of my million ridiculous questions or concerns about my little herd. Thank you Dr. Manring and everyone at ECLAP for all that you do for us!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Dr. Harlan and his practice partners consistently provide effective veterinary care for my horses. They take the time to describe their care plan and rationale and have always been accurate in their diagnoses. I also very much appreciate Dr. Harlan's and his practice partners' calm, kind, and confident manner with my horses.</text>

We recently changed vets after adopting a new puppy and not feeling very satisfied with her puppy exam at our previous vet.  We very pleased with Dr. Christel and staff at ECLAP.  It was a completely different  experience compared to our previous vet.  Even with the restrictions in place due to COVID 19, we felt we received very personal and thorough service and our dogs were their priority while working with them.  I would highly recommend them!<//text>

The doctor is always on time is prepared and always makes myself and my horses very comfortable. Always asks if I have all the information I need and takes the time to look at my animals to see if he sees anything out of the ordinary.<//Review>

Our little Schnauzer Annie, needed medical attention on a Saturday morning.  We adopted her last October, so we had not taken her to a veterinarian yet.  Caitlin met me at their office, even though she had an emergency call that morning.
She was wonderful with our Annie, kind and caring, and was so thorough with her.  She explained everything to me, and I decided then that she would be Annie’s new designated vet!!   And thankfully, Annie is going to be just fine! ♥️</Text>

East County Large Animal Practice is the best Veterinarian care in the Southwest. They took immediate care of our precious friend - helping her to be rid of a nasty growth that other Vets just shook their head at. We are very grateful to them. 5 real stars. Wish we could give them 10 stars!<//review>

He was even proactive and answered some questions that I could come up because I am a new goat owner. His demeanor with the animals was calm and gentle. It was clear that he likes animals. He was also kind to my small kids. We are so incredibly happy to have found him!</text><resp>None<//resp></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Harlan provides compassionate care to my older horse & pony, as well as my three donkeys.  He is professional, caring and communicates well.  The level of care that Dr. Harlan provides is excellent, so is the ease of making appointments and follow-up calls with the staff at E.C.L.A.P.
I trust Dr. Harlan and am confident that he wants the very best for my equine family.< /text>

<review>***Update*** I have changed my review to 5 stars. What a difference in experience from the last vet. Our last vet has had months and months of "fill in" vets after a health crisis. We have not had a very good experience there since. They also made clerical changes which was the straw that broke the camel's back. After talking with Dr. Crystal today, I feel so much better about my dog's care.
It's too soon to say yet as I don't know if they will be better than my previous vet. I have not heard back from them about all the tests they performed. I did call and leave a message for the vet that I saw and did not receive a call back. I do like the setup and the people there are incredibly nice. I didn't feel rushed and they seemed thorough. Slightly more expensive than my previous vet. I hope the higher price equals better care.</review>< pics>

I was referred to ECLAP when I first moved to East County in April '19. I'm so glad I was, I have nothing but amazing things to say about the entire team. Super nice & great customer service. I never feel as if they try to upsell me or overcharge me. They truly want to help you and your furry loved one. I'm so glad I have such an amazing vet for my fur kids!<//Text>

Dr. Bear and all of the staff at East County Large and Small Animal Practice were wonderful! The vet tech even held and loved on Cutter while she was up on the table being examined so she would feel comfortable. They got back to me right away with lab results which was really nice, as waiting on results can be very nerve-racking. I am so happy to have found Dr. Bear and his team and look forward to visiting them with Cutter for many years to come. Thank you!<//Text>

My parents have used this practice for years for their horses, we had a bad accident with our lab and he needed amputation but we didn’t have a regular vet so I gave ECLAP a call. Their prices are great, as well as every staff member we encountered.  Seriously the best vet we’ve ever been too. Thanks to Dr Bear, Ashley and the vet assistant who helped with surgery, for taking great care of our boy Ranger.</review>< pics>

Took my dog to this practice yesterday, 12-18-19 for the first time. Everyone was very friendly and welcoming. All the other clients there told me how happy they are with this vet hospital and after using
them I can see why. All of the employees seem genuinely happy to work there.</review>

Loved our experience at ECCLAP. Got right in to see a vet after requesting an appointment.  Dr.Bear was very helpful and made us feel very taken care of. Prices were VERY reasonable.  Checked out after an exam and medication and paid less than I did at my usual vet for just an exam. We will definitely be back!< /text>

<review>I brought my 15+ yr old kitty with kidney disease in for bloodwork, it was done within 20 minutes and Dr Bear came out to review the findings with me and was so compassionate. The kind staff (including Ashley) even took the time to fix the covid haircut that I had given my kitty since her groomer is closed (they are much better at this than I am !)< /review>< Pictures>

We moved further away from our long time vet three years ago. I finally made the decision this week when our dog needed care to switch to ECLAP because they are so much closer in proximity to our house, and they came so highly recommended. Dr Oman was wonderful! We officially have a new vet. Super happy with the care our Nala received.< /text>

<user>116330443000686664953< /user><Text>Wonderful experience! Dr, Christel was marvelous and I know that going ahead my kitty, Arrow, will be receiving the best of care. I was unaware that Arrow was in stage 2 kidney disease but Dr. Christel showed me the results of the blood work she did and we discussed what can be done to at least slow down the progression. He is also hyper-thyroid and I feel comfortable knowing he will be able to get his meds on a regular basis. I came to ECLSAP because the vet I was going to in Alpine (Alpine Veterinary Hospital) retired and I discovered it had been bought by the other vet in Alpine (County Veterinarian) where I had a horrid experience several years earlier. This Practice is only one freeway exit further down for me so still convenient enough. I love the country setting here and my kitty was treated gently and kindly by the rest of the staff. I'm so glad I found this Practice and highly recommend it.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>This was my first experience in dealing with ECLAP. I recently adopted 2 goats/kids, I’ve only owned chickens, rabbit, dogs and cats . My 5 month old goat Wyatt- was struggling to urinate for a few days, I worried about stones.
After doing what most people do, I began reading everything I could on the internet, farmers home remedies and such. I was more afraid to cause my boy any harm. So I made the call.
My call was answered by Dr. Harlan, I explained his symptoms. And Dr. Harlan patiently listened and was so amazing because he took the time to explain all possibilities, options if it was indeed a blockage and his own past experiences. Even though they were booked, Dr. Harlan suggested I bring Wyatt in (They do home visits too) and he would see him between patients.
After a couple of hours, Dr. Harlan called me and    again took the time explained his findings, and allowed me to ask questions without making me feel rushed. We had a plan. He was honest, empathetic, and never recommended additional procedures or gave hidden false hope.  He gave me an estimated cost, which I was so fearful off( I need both kidneys- but would have sold one if needed) the price was doable.
Wyatt came home the same day in the evening and has been doing amazing. He’s on medications and I learned so much on proper feeding and care.
I will continue to use this amazing vet.  From Dr. Harlan (One of a team), the techs I spoke with  and the friendly staff at in the office. This is by far a 5-Star experience.

Thank you ECLAP/ Thank you Dr. Harlan and team from Wyatt and myself.<//text><Rate>5< /Rate>< time>

In an unfamiliar time of isolation, I was warmly greeted in my somewhat emotional state over concern for my "pup", a very large doberman.  I felt "heard". Care was taken to address all of my questions.  Thank  you ECLAP staff.</Review>

I thought the two receptionists in the front office were unwelcoming for our first visit.  We were the only ones in the office and they couldn't pry their eyes off their computers to acknowledge me.  Even when one of them was asking me questions, it was while she was facing the computer.  I could not get my daughter's wheelchair through the door and, of course, they were oblivious to my plight.  I left my daughter outside of the office.  The receptionist then took us to a room and tried to weigh both my dogs.  She did not even try to talk to either of them.  The vet saw each dog for 10 min each, which is fine for a well check up.  She did not review the past records sent from our previous vet in front of me.  I'm giving  3 stars to be nice.  My previous vet always had a busy office and were still welcoming and nice.  This was actually my second visit.  I walked in one day to check out the office since I just moved to Blossom Valley.  It was empty again and I was greeted with a look of "why are you here."  I should have known then not to come back.  I think this office needs to sell itself a little better.</text>

<Text>My horse had been a client/ patient for the past 4 1/2 years. All past check ups have been "ranch visits" where he is boarded. This time I trailered him to you. Everything went very smoothly. Dr. Johnson explained everything during the exam, including a concern which will be monitored over the next few months. She explained treatment options thoroughly including photos and diagrams of the affected area.< /Text><user_name>Fenton Sue<//user_name><GmapID>0x80d95f61e1666133:0x2c331ec580442730</GmapID>< resp>

ECLAP is the best! We are so fortunate that our neighbor told us about you. We couldn't be more satisfied with your care, concern and friendly service we experience with each visit.
Dr Oman is awesome! He saved our Vinny's toe when another vet wanted to remove it. And your staff is terrific!
We recommend your veterinary care every chance we get.
Thank you!<//Review>

This place is amazing! Seriously. I brought my litter of mini goldendoodles here for an exam and first shots.
To start, everyone that works here is SUPER friendly! The exam itself was above and beyond what other vets do for first exams with puppies.
At checkout they accept Apple Pay which is so convenient!
I live in Ocean Beach which is about a 45 minute drive from this vet but they will now be my primary vet! Going here is like a little mini vacay. It’s so spacious and on my visit they had some adorable alpacas!

Bottom line.. do yourself a favour and go here!< /Text>

<Review>Prompt service and friendly, caring staff. I also like that the setting is in the country. Being on a property makes it feel much more inviting. It also doesn't hurtd that this is 1.5 miles from my house, making trips fast and easy for someone travelling with a less than amused cat. :)</Review>< time>

My horse was colicking and the response of Dr. Chandler was quick, professional and meticulous.  He followed up with a phone call that evening and again in the morning which gave me further assurance that all would we be well.  It is wonderful to know that after the call is done, you are still on the Vets radar in case something goes terribly wrong.</review>

<text>I can’t say enough wonderful things about the whole team at ECLAP. They took care of our dog like she was a princess and they truly care. Brandi is so helpful and sweet and  Dr Dan is outstanding with all my animals. But the surgery he did on our last dog was a tough one but he took it on and did a perfect job. Thanks to him we  will have many more years with her. We will be Forever thankful for his kindness.

Even though our family got deviating news about our dog, I could never speak more highly about this place! The appointment was very quick and they broke the news to us in an extremely gentle way. The Dr was very sweet and I felt like she took care of my dog as she would her own.
I would like to think I'm a pretty tough woman but when we got the news that we only have a few short months left with my dog, I cried like a baby and the Dr comforted me like she was a long time friend. She gave me a huge and let me cry on her shoulder as long as I needed. She chatted with us about different treatment options and was very honest with us. This Dr made all the difference in the world. Thank you so much for your care and kind heart. It is more appreciated than you know.

Also, this vet came highly recommend by another vet and even though I live nearly an hour away, I will always take my animals here because the care was amazing. This is more than a vet, they treated us like family .<//review>

We met and had Dr Manring do dentals and a small lump removal from my Jake’s lip.  She was awesome.  Being a new vet for me we talked about how I liked my horses interacted with.  Dr Manring was spot on!  And my normally suspicious older mare was comfortable with her.  Dentals went easy and no one was sore in their mouth.  And Jake’s lip is a thing of beauty!  5 stitches, no separation after 3 days, dry and you have to look close to see he had a dime sized lump removed!  I’m so pleased.  I definitely would recommend Dr Manring!<//Text>

Dr Catlin Manring is an excellent vet. I was impressed with her knowledge regarding horses and pleasent demeanor. Her obvious love of horses shined through as she worked on my senior horse, talking to him, even though he was being a rather difficult paitent during a float.  She will be my first choice Vet for future care for him. I highly recommend her.< /text>

My dog needed an injection for her allergies. All well and good, but the extra service and willingness to answer questions about food choices and how to keep my middle aged dog healthy and joints mobile, were very much appreciated. The information was thorough and made it easy to make a plan for my dog. I was very pleased.< /Text>

Definitely going to make this my vet clinic from here on out.  Very affordable as well.  We've tried a few others in the past but felt like they were just trying to upsell us on medications and services.  Highly recommend ECLAP!</text>< Pics>

Military working dogs aren’t always the easiest clients to help, but they absolutely knocked it out of the park and kept me from going bankrupt at the same time, unlike other vets in the area who were easily 3x the price.

Dr. Harlan came out to address several issues I was having with my 28 year old horse. He was professional, knowledgeable, as well as personable. I would highly recommend Dr. Harlan to anyone needing a quality veterinarian for their horses. My experience with East County Large Animal Practice has been great and I will continue to use them for all of my horse’s care.<//text>

We’ve been taking our 6 year old Doberman for veterinarian care since she was a puppy. We love everything about East County Large  and Small Animal Practice!  Although everyone is highly professional and well trained, they are all approachable, friendly, kind and clearly animal lovers.

Last week we  thought Willow had been gouged by her brother while playing at the beach. Over the weekend we noticed the wound had worsened and looked more like a bad spider bite. I called Monday morning at 8am and the receptionist said she’d get back to me to see if she could make some changes to fit us in.  It took an hour or so but she called back and got us in to see Dr Omen, who was great!

There have been some new members to the staff as one of the former owners retired recently.  Knowing this, I was a bit worried about getting in to see a vet quickly and even about getting a call back within a day.  Apparently things are running smoothly now as all was done beyond my expectation.

Gratefully, the prices for their services are completely reasonable.  For our appointment Monday, the ointment, antiseptic gauze, antibiotics,  and DrOmen’s and his assistant’s services were all inclusive in the cost.

I recommend East County Large and Small Animal Practice wholeheartedly!</text>

Dr. Ryan and the staff were wonderful to Sammy and loved the way we both were treated. Sammy, my dachshund has had skin and allergy issues all of his life ( rescue 🐶) and its been and will be a life long issue for him. Having a vet who listens and cares it important to me and essential to Sammy's well being.
I believe we're off to a great start! Very efficient service and beautiful surroundings love the openness of the facility. Thank you!< /text>

I had my first vet appointment with my two kitties at ECLAP recently from a trusted referral. My experience was outstanding!! They were gentle and thorough with the kitties and very professional from the back office to the front office. I feel like I finally found an animal hospital that is high quality!!< /text>

Doctor and staff were outstanding in their care of Maxine.  Their care met my highest expectations.  Glad the Army Veterinary office at Mirarmar recommended I go to you for the x-rays she needed.  Best of luck and continued success.

Dr. Chandler is always wonderful.  I’ve know him for 30 years.  He has the same concern today as he did when I met him.  He is so knowledgeable and compassionate. I’ve always trusted him completely with my beloved horses.

Dr. Harlan was great, this was my first "farm call" ever and he was very helpful and gave us all kinds of useful information, answered all my questions and was very thorough.  He even gave me the opportunity to see how to give my pig and injection behind the ear in case I would like to give it a try in the future.  Buddy, our 4H pig is doing much better today :)  Thanks Dr. Harlan you ROCK!!!< /review>

The vet that came back was awesome! He was very gentle with my girl even though she wasn't cooperating. He was knowledgeable about her issue and took the time to discuss all the treatment option. Charlotte even got a hoof trim!

Years later and they are still the gold standard in veterinary care. Dr.Harlan came out to my house in the middle of the night to help us. Everyone we’ve come into contact with has just been great.<//text>

I took my pet pig to be spayed. My experience was wonderful from reception to pick up. Each person I met was very caring and cordial. Dr Oman gave me a, brief but complete, tour of the facility. I left there feeling like I had just met James Harriott. "All Creatures Great and Small". I highly recommend ECLAP.< /text>

Great all around experience. They took good care of our pooch while in their care. All procedures and costs were fully explained in advance by the knowledgeable receptionist. I would heartily endorse ECLAP for veterinary care.</Text>

After a bad experience and an INCORRECT DIAGNOSIS on my black lab at VCA on Broadway, I took my lab to ECLAP and found out my dog does not have a heart problem but is anemic. Took both my labs and was very happy with their exam, the veterinarian and treatments. THANK YOU !  Staff is awesome, too!<//text>

The barn atmosphere helped my dog relax prior to his appointment.  We waited outside and it really helped a dog that panics when he goes to the vet.  The staff was courteous and very caring.<//text>

Heart passed away in the night. I wish we would have been Proactive and done more.  I spent $100 and really didn't get any result.

As always, the staff and vets here are amazing. You can just tell how much they care about your animals. I have 4 dogs, so I am here a lot and I have always been able to see a doctor within a day and same day if urgent. Added bonus, you never know if you'll get to see a horse, pig, sheep or goat there!<//review>

Good Morning! This was a write up from our last visit! Want to reiterate how amazing Dr. Bear is! Below will be about our visit yesterday! Dr. Bear was absolutely FANTASTIC!!!!!! I brought my little black Pug in named Ernie and from the moment I arrived to the moment we left it was an absolutely wonderful experience. I called the previous day to make an appointment before hours and the gal on the phone wound up talking to me for like 15 minutes and before we hung up wished my little guy a speedy recovery and hoped that he would be feeling better soon. I hung up the phone and had to tell my husband just how nice even the receptionist was. Dr. Bear took his time with Ernie, did a very thorough exam, then gave me his diagnosis and recommendations. I felt as though he treated my baby as though Ernie was his own. No denying not only does Dr. Bear and staff love animals, but have a love for people. Top notch experience!
Yesterday our little guy Ernie, has his teeth cleaned, and Dr. Bear was again AMAZING and compassionate. He knew how much our little guy means to us! Called immediately after to let us know he was all done and doing well! We can’t say enough! Thank you Dr. Bear! ❤️🐾</Review>

I have been twice to ECLAP clinic and tho it was an hour drive from my home in Escondido, it was well worth the trip.  The first visit was to have several of my dog's teeth pulled.   The last visit was to  have a doctor look her over and check a lump in her side that is slowly growing.  X-rays were taken and it was determined it was not encroaching on any vital organs, or hurting her in any way.  It  is not something that shows under her coat, and we are just going to watch it in the future.  I was very pleased with both the thorough exam and explanation given by the vet.  In getting estimates from two vets I found that ECLAP is much more reasonable.Thank you< /Review>

Needed to get both my golden retrievers a rabies booster. We were in and out within 10 minutes, and that was without having to make an appointment first (they had received an exam within the last 12 months). Very reasonable charge for the boosters, too. Thanks, ECLAP!</Text>

I’m so glad I switched to this vet .. hands down I felt like the listened and heard my concerns.  I felt like my pets health was first.  I switched to this vet after several years of using another and feeling like they were never listening to me. Listening is key in life!!! These people heard And delivered above and beyond my expectations.   Thank you 😊<//Text>

<Text>I absolutely love ECLAP ! Everyone there is so kind, loving and down to earth. The girls in the office are always so funny and nice. Dr. Ryan Bear is the best, he’s so honest. I’ve been to other vets where you go in for a skin rash and walk out with a quote for over a thousand dollars. Not here at ECLAP! They always save me money. I’m just so grateful for them. ❤️<//Text><Date>1526836755333</Date></record></dataset><record>

<rate>5<//rate><text>ECLAP personnel did a wonderful job with my small terrier-mix, Toby. Toby usually scared at the vet. He is a rescue dog and has obviously had bad experiences prior to our adopting him. The vet at ECLAP was gentle and understanding of Toby's "personality problems". They determined where and what his problem was and offered several options for treatment. Overall, a very good visit to the vet...even if Toby didn't think so. Thanks...Jim Brown<//text>< pics>

<Text>We started using ECLAP about 30 years ago and have  gotten outstanding service and care from all the Vets that work there.  They are all extremely knowledgeable and if they don't know something, they aren't afraid to ask their associate for an opinion or suggestion.  Dr. Smith is especially good with older horses and shows compassion for both them and their owners.   It has also been great having a small animal office available.  Kind of like "one stop shopping."   Love their yearly Christmas party!!!    Great way to show they appreciate loyalty.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80d95f61e1666133:0x2c331ec580442730< /gmapID></record>

I had an emergency with a horse I lease and the owner's vet was not available so I called ECLAP, the vet practice I use for the horse I own. Dr. Harlan was there in less than 45 minutes. He laid out a clear plan for the horse's care and offered reassurance that, although there was a ways to go yet, he felt the horse could get better. I had been afraid we would be putting him down that day but Dr. Harlan got us over the hump. I love ECLAP.</review>

<review>Going to a new Vet can always be stressful but everyone at ECLAP made us feel at home from the first phone call to check out.   Both my cats were at ease and comfortable with everyone.   My stubborn male cat, Flynn, even purred while there which he rarely does.  Loved the service and will be coming back as needed.  Thank you ECLAP< /review></record></dataset><record>

<review>I can't tell you how grateful we are for your accommodating services!  We had no appointment but they got us in!  All staff helped us get our injured dog out of the car & into exam room he is 94 lbs!  The doctor & his assistants were so wonderful and took care of our big boy!  He is healing at home now!  Thank you all so much!!!

I want to thank Dr. Harlan for coming out to take care of Ellie Mae's hooves. Unfortunately the past farriers I had out, we had bad experiences.

Dr. Harlan was so gentle and took his time and did an amazing job, I am so pleased!!  I want to say I have received nothing but the best care from ECLAP.  Each and everyone of your staff have always been so helpful and professional, I can't thank you enough!

I am so thankful I have found ECLAP, I will continue to recommend you to my family and friends.

Thank you again,

Meloney & Ellie Mae< /text>

I was told "it's a good idea to neuter your dog before you microchip them" that's such BS. Also they charge ~$100 for microchip vs. $50 at every other vet.<//Text>

<Review>I am very happy with ECLAP, who have taken care of my horses for 15 years.  Dr. Smith is one of the two best vets that I know.  When my horse developed a rare form of cancer, he worked tirelessly to find a treatment for him.  Thanks to Dr. Smith, my beautiful boy got to enjoy many months of retirement.  He is a compassionate and gifted vet.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Both Dr's Smith and Chandler are always available by phone to answer any questions I have about his feed and changes I can do to improve his nutrition. They are gentle and kind to my old guy when they check his teeth and do not float them unless they really  need them. They use a lower dose of sedative because of his age which means they have to put up with some of his shenanigans. I have been with them for 30 years and highly recommend them. I am very comfortable leaving the care of my dear friend to them.</Review><Date>1380750750764<//Date><gmapID>0x80d95f61e1666133:0x2c331ec580442730<//gmapID><user>110264549859688931672</user>< user_name>

<Text>Exceptional!  Took our dog in for a dental procedure based on recommendation from a friend.  Our (former) vet was going to charge over $1000 and the team at ECLAP did it for under $400.
Dr. Bear did a great job with Duke and called me personally after he was done. He answered all my questions and was the most personable and approachable vet I have ever experienced.  I wish we weren't getting sent to Okinawa so Duke could keep going here.
Cannot recommend the entire team at ECLAP enough!< /Text>< Pictures>

< review>
I did some research and found this place on google
I was pretty impressed with their reviews , so I made an appointment for my 3  1/2 month old Mini  pig for his nurturing ! At first I was pretty upset because I had dropped him off at 8 am and was told that I was going to get a call as soon as he was out of surgery, So it was around 1:30 and I hadn’t heard from them so I called and at first they told me that he was all done and then the receptionist put  me on hold and said that he did not have his surgery yet the doctor had a emergency,which I understand there are emergency , things come up! but there could have been just a little better communication on their part.   So then I was told to pick him up at 4:30 , I had about a 45 minute drive , I waited until 4 pm. still no call
so I started to wonder what was going on ,I drove up and he was just getting done , So I waited out on the patio and shortly after the doctor came up and gave me an update, then went to check on my pig
I really liked that the doctor took the time to come out and explain everything to me and had the time for any questions or concerns! At that point I was more relaxed!  He also made sure that before I left that he explained the recovery and healing process again and made sure that I didn’t have any more questions! So overall I give the facility a four stars but the doctor did an amazing job on my Pepper he definitely gets a five ⭐️ star rating !  I recommend Dr.Harlan ,he was absolutely professional,friendly and caring for my pig<//review>

<review>I had an issue with the meds I ordered through the online store - totally my mistake - and ECLAP immediately sent me what I should have ordered and told me to bring in the meds I had mistakenly ordered the next time I was in town, even though that wouldn't be for close to a month.  They did this without any charge other than the postage.  I've been using them for 10 years, and couldn't be happier.< /review><date>1552666590791< /date><GmapID>0x80d95f61e1666133:0x2c331ec580442730<//GmapID><Rating>5< /Rating>< userid>

They did great with my filly, couldn't recommend them enough. She went lame overnight from an abscess, they were out the next day, explained everything they were doing, and made sure I felt comfortable with what I was left to do. Eclap also saved my mustang from colic about a year ago, in my experience they always do great work.<//Text>

I am very gapph with the responsiveness and attention bgiving to my mare when she was colicing.  Dr. Johnson made every attempt to ensure we knew exactly what was going on, very detailed for me in her notes of aftercare and follow up.  I highly appreciated the 24-hour call center as this has been a huge help for me.  I could not of been any happier.  Thank you Dr. Johnson, you made all the difference Sunday morning.< /text>

ECLAP was a very pleasant first time experience. The staff was friendly and there wasn’t a long wait and most of all they spent time with my dog and treating her good and answering questions for me.</Review>

We were more than impressed with ECLAP! They took such good care of our Sophie Loren (8 month old Goldendoodle) for her Spading surgery yesterday. They are definitely there for the right reasons. Their cost was close to $500 less than what our current vet quoted us. We are 100% moving Sophie’s care to ECLAP! Thank you.<//Text>

I would never recommend these people to anyone. I brought my ten-year-old cat in to get her teeth removed and ever since then she's acted like I beat her and she runs away and hides underneath the bed 24 hours a day I told these people to take extra care of my cat and ever since she's not the same cat anymore and she's traumatized by The Experience she's had with these people. Not only that but after the surgery her face swell up so badly that the next day she had pus coming out of her mouth and her whole face was just so swollen that I had to take her somewhere else to get her help. I don't even think they gave her a pain killer when they were doing the surgery , she will never be the same cat again. They didn't even give her an antibiotic shot after the surgery so I think they wanted her to get infected so I would bring her back to them to fix her. I would not trust these people with your cat.</Review>

Always a great experience with great people.
We lost our Oldest Rescue on the 2th of last month and then on the 30th our Smallest and Second Oldest Rescue had a major Seizure.
The wonderful people at ECLAP saw him quickly and after some checking, reassured us he was doing okay.
Can't say enough good things about them all.< /review>

A+A+A+A+.....I cant say enough about the care that the Doctors and staff give to my family,animals. I really feel at home at ECLAP, They take care of my Pigs,Goats,Cattle,Sheep,Dogs,Cats.Dr Oman has gone over and above with the health care of our farm, The office staff takes such good care of all of us, human and fur babies too!!They are always so friendly, always has time to stop and chat ,even if they are right in the middle of something! I so appreciate all the knowledge they all have to take such good care of all of the farm!! And I have NEVER felt unfairly charged for the services we have received. I highly recommend ECLAP..< /Review>

<Review>We were looking for a new vet, read reviews on Descanso Neighbors and Nextdoor app regarding ECLAP, many positive reviews. We visited ECLAP with our 4 large dogs and could not have been more impressed. The Veterinarian's, Vet techs and office staff were accommodating,  warm and caring with our pups. We highly reccomend ECLAP< /Review>< user_name>

<review>ECLAP has some of the best vets I have had.  When I call in with a question, either the office will ask a vet in  the office or you can leave a message.  They will return your call with the information you are looking for.  They are caring and knowledgeable and if one does not know the answer, they will use their resources to find out.  I would and do recommend ECLAP to anyone who is looking for a great vet.</review></record></dataset><record>

Superlatives!  I couldn't make up my mind whether to have a ranch call or an office visit, and the office staff was extremely patient with me.  We no lo have large animals, but I didn't want to haul three cats and a dog into the local vet's office, even though it is just down the street. I would have to pay for four office visits, and to take the dog and the cats together to the ECLAP small animal office was not really not possible---so we paid for an old fashioned ranch call and Dr. Smith accommodated us like he always does.  Dr. Smith is a caring, down to earth guy and always takes the practical approach. We have been with ECLAP for about 25 years and we have never had any bad issues with them.  Highly supportive as well as understanding and ranch practical.<//review>

< Review>
I have a 12 1/2 yr old dog who is my dearest friend.  He is a large pit mix and the sweetest animal.  He is my constant companion, he goes everywhere with me.  In the last 6 months he is really slowing down and gettting up and down have been hard on his back end.  He has had is right knee operated on and 3 cancer surgeries in his hind quarters which is why the drastic slowing down.  Dr. Oman has been helping me find solutions on how to make more comfortable.  We have tried a few different things and now just got done with a series of 8 laser treatments on him.  It is like having my old dog back.  He stopped following me around, now he is doing that again!  He wants to run and play when we are outside.  He can jump up on our bed again.  We know he is an older dog, but if you saw him, you would swear he was no older than 5 or 6.  Thank you Dr. Oman, thank you for giving my dog a less painless life.  Thank you for taking the time with me, the crazy dog owner.  Kathy who has done all the laser treatments is wonderful.  I have sent other dog owener in, and they all have nothing but good things to say.  My family has used them for years, now luckily we are too.  Thank you Thank you Thank you!!<//Review>

< Review>
I'm a relatively new horse owner.   Dr. Chandler and his staff have been great - they are on time, competitively priced, wonderful with my Arabian, and provide me with the information I need to be a better owner.   I can always rely on ECLAP!</Review>

I think the word "CARE" is the most appropriate when describing what ECLAP is all about. They care about the animals, they care about the owners, and the excellent care they provide is way beyond the normal. Communication is another aspect where they excel. The office staff is patient and works with us in so many ways. When I call on ECLAP I know I am providing the best medical care for animals. The medical staff explains in terms we can understand exactly what is happening and our choices. They provide us with information and explanations, they tolerate the over reactions, they have compassion for our worry or sadness, they supply humor when it helps, understanding when needed and support whenever required. I think we in San Diego are so fortunate to have the very best which is ECLAP.<//text>

<Review>I have been using ECLAP for 20 plus years for my beloved horses. When they expanded to small animals we began taking our dogs there. The Vets and office staff is unsurpassed. They take time to explain treatments and options on each visit. They never pressure you on decisions that must be made but if asked is always willing to give you their opinion. They do not hesitate to call in specialists when needed. I am on the board of the local horse show club, Tumbleweed Riding Club. ECLAP has been very generous and a big supporter of our group. ECLAP is a huge asset to the community and to each animal owner.<//Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

We are so glad that we found out about Eclap! The staff were all very friendly, and Dr. Bear was great. We got in and out for our puppy appt in 30 mins, with all of our concerns addressed, and it didn't cost us a fortune as it would've elsewhere.< /Review>

I have been with ECLAP since 1999 - they are fantastic. Response is quick and courteous. They care for my horses and dog almost as much as I do. They listen to what I have to say and work with me. They have helped me pull my horse KitKat through Laminitis  and were there to help me with the passing of my horse Magic and my dog Athena. They are the best vets I have found and would never change.
Thanks so much ECLAP!!<//text>

< review>
Dr Ryan is the Bomb he Rocks I love this place.  I rescue and have 7 dogs of my own as well.  I have been going to a bigger practice and more and more feeling like they just do not care .  I heard about eclap and decided to give them a try.  I am ever glad I did.  These people are what vets should be.     I am not always an easy client to deal with but Dr Ryan took the time answered all my questions.  He is calm cool collected exactly what you want for you babies.
Dr Ryan Opps I think it is Dr Bear LOL will be seeing my animals from now on.  Lucky guy stuck with me now.
I had trust issues with my last vet office but not at this vet they will be honest and when you meet Dr Ryan you will see .  For me it only took 1 visit to realize  this was the vet for me.   I put off a dental for my dog for 2 years because my last vet I just did not trust that they cared about my dog.  At the vet I was going to seemed like my animals  were just  $100 bills with tails.  I don't care about the cost but I wanted the vet to actually care about my dog and that is what you get at ECLAP people that care.

Cathy the Vet tech who assists Dr Ryan is abslutly precious, she treats your pet as if it were her own.  There are no words to say how wonderful she is, but know this I appeciated how my dog was cared for by Dr Ryan and Cathy.    I cannot believe how lucky I am to have found them. In the middle of the dental one of the nice tech/receptions came and told me all was going well.  That meant so much to me to know my Dog was Ok and doing well.  They all knew how nervous I was and everyone of them did what they could to make me feel more relaxed.
As much as I would like to keep this place all to myself, if you are unhappy with your current vet you may want to try ECLAP.
warning there is no fancy exam rooms or fluff but your pet could care less, the care is beyond wonderful at ECLAP the fancy fluff  you get at other places means nothing if your beloved pet is just a number.
ECLAP Dr Bear Cathy and Staff Wonderfu people don't ever change
thanks ECLAP
will be making appointment for my other guys</review>

Used this vet for 4 years for annual care. My horse dropped a significant amount of weight and had a different vet look at them his mouth had ramps and ulcers even with being floated annually by their "vet" for 400 a year. Avoid at all costs.</text>
