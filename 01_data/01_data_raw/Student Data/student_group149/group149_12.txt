<Text>At this time , doing the pandemic, its scary to go out to these hospital settings.  This visit was great . The staff has excellent customer service skills.  The Dr. was amazing.  Fast and quick.  Clean and safe environment.
Glad I  went there.  I cut my finger, and had to go.  They made it easy.  Thanks to the entire staff!!!!!< /Text><gmap_id>0x808522cd1131966d:0x44e320d4d5dfadaf<//gmap_id><user_name>Kim Gant< /user_name>< Rating>

Easy to get appointment on app. Was able to fill in details on app prior to appointment. Quick admission and seen by physician promptly. Physician was attentive and empathetic. Was contacted with lab results the next day. Called the next day to see how I was feeling. Very professional and well organized. Thanks.< /Text>

Every time I’ve come here, I’m treated above my expectations. My visit with Mandeep Singh N.P. this week had me marvel at how generously focused, witty & compassionate he was. He shared valued pearls of wisdom about my common issue where other doctors have failed. He gave me top notch care, ran immediate tests & his prognosis was spot on. I leave knowing I’ve been well cared for & appreciate their app where they can follow up with you or you can communicate back with them.</text>

If you don't use app no one will communicate your results with you. Recently my husband went to urgent care not feeling good. They told him to check results on app. He is not a tech person and don't know what app. No one called his results until after 4 days I told him to call the clinic and get a result.  As soon as he called and they said "OH you are positive".  we are very disappointed . At least call and let the person know. His first time using urgent care.</Review>

<review>The Urgent Care visit was great! All staff caring and helpful. I did call and made an appointment in advance. Upon arrival I waited a reasonable amount of time to be seen. Annette the PA was wonderful both skilled and personable making you feel comfortable. I found out making appointments and check in can be done online. This app works great! The doctoring staff can check with patients and patients can express how they are doing without the bother of a phone call  and being put on hold. Thank you!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<rate>2</rate><Text>This is supposedly a “Walk-In” clinic so I walk in & am told that I can’t be seen until 6pm. So much for being a walk-in clinic. The rude receptionist then told me I could go to the ER, after I told her it was for a migraine I’ve had for 4 days... I’m not going to pay a $200+ copay to go to the ER & sit with covid/deathly ill people. She then asked if I wanted to take the 6pm, I then said I guess because I don’t have another option. Her reply to that was well you do have option then asked for my info. 1. I have been a receptionist at several doctors offices in my past & never talked to people like that. 2. When I go to a walk-in clinic I normally would expect to be seen within an 1-2 hrs & not told to come back at 6pm for an appointment.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I truly love this place. From the moment I first called and then walked in and was taken care of by the warm and friendly front desk people and then the nurse practitioners-I actually prefer this place over my own doctor’s office and my children’s pediatric office. They naturally act like they truly care and the place is so CLEAN. Grateful for this place and willing to drive half hour out of my way to be seen here.</review>

<Text>I was visiting California from Texas and I had an issue with urinary tract infection. I  filled out the questions online. Upon arrival, I was seen by a very professional doctor. They were following CDC guidelines and I was thankful for that. I would encourage anyone who has an illness to visit Northbay Urgent Care Vacaville.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I have always received the most excellent care at NB Urgent Care. The Nurse Practitioners/Physicians are nothing less than excellent. I’ve been there for sprained ankles to much more severe problems. I think they can handle anything! The staff is just as excellent as well. They are compassionate, professional and personable and give you their full attention.  It’s good to know you have a place to go when you need it most.</text>

Staff is courteous, professional and efficient.  Was seen and treated quickly; healthcare professional even checked on me the next day to ensure treatment plan was working.  Carbon App is exceptional and easy to use; great way to communicate with the provider.<//Text>

Great staff, everyone from the nurses to the doctors to the front desk were extremely helpful. They have an app you can download on your phone to input most of your information to make the visit quicker. You can either make an appointment or have a walk in visit. I would recommend this place to anyone 100% great urgent care!</review>

I can say, these people are angels. I was just in here on feb.6th, and the entire team there was so helpful and hard at work. They did chest xray, and flu swabs. Then they treated me. Thanks to them for being so great.< /Review>

I've had to visit here a couple of times recently and I've had both an amazing a terrible experience. The Carbon app is really user friendly and convenient. My first visit was earlier this week and I had an absolutely fantastic experience. The medical assistant Jesus and the front desk Sara (who I think was my medical assistant today) were both phenomenal. The doctor there, Valerie was very quick and efficient while still providing amazing patient care. The only reason this place doesn't get five stars is due to the front desk receptionist today. She was very rude to patients, not to myself but the way she responded to other patients was beyond ridiculous. If a receptionist acts like that, they shouldn't have a job. I didn't catch her name, but she seemed to be uncivil and getting upset for no reason. I don't know how a place with such great staff overall would keep an employee like that.< /review>

This place is really nice. A couple of the other "urgent cares" look like refugee camps. This was clean, up to date, and doctors were very professional. The price was $195. It would have been cheaper at Kaise but I couldn't get in for 2 weeks. I would go there again if I couldn't go to KP.<//Review>

<Text>I would give more ⭐️‘s if I could as I had an amazing & wonderful experience at Northbay Urgent care last week. The entire staff from the highly efficient & lovely Danara at the front desk, who went out of her way to make sure I knew where I was with my prescriptions being called in, a referral she will forward onto a specialist, along with other useful information exceeding the norm of what one would perceive her position to hold towards providing support for my visit & aftercare. Medical assistant Hector was a delight, pleasant & efficient. The ever so wonderful Nurse Practioner Sukhdeep Kaur (Suki), was a complete joy! NP SUKI greeted me with a genuine smile, never made me feel like she was rushed & was very intuitive/spot on with her diagnosis where I didn’t have to go into deep details about my issue. NP Suki knew exactly what to do, provided me with ample medication & even followed up with me a few days later to see how I was doing. I’m new to the area & had such a great experience I’m going to make NorthBay my new home to meet my medical needs. So refreshing & grateful to find such a wonderful group of pleasant, efficient  individuals in the medical community.<//Text>< pics>

<Review>Setting up an appointment online was easy, I got a same day appointment.
Wait time was minimal. And I absolutely loved the NP I saw Jane Newhard Parks. If the need arises would definitely go again to Northbay's Urgent care in Nutree again. Also they offer complimentary water, and coffee made the short wait time even shorter.< /Review></record>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>Extremely unprofessional. I tried to provide my information on my insurance and they told me to call back in later. This is unusual for me. When I entered the exam room, one of the nurses named Zeus told me to put my phone away after he had gotten done taking my temperature..I hadn’t had it out up until that point. I relayed that I was trying to get my insurance information and was sending that last message. Once I told him this, he exited the room and started speaking about what had just transpired as if I was doing something extremely wrong. I heard the whole conversation, and I think this establishment is completely unprofessional.<//review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x808522cd1131966d:0x44e320d4d5dfadaf< /gmapID></record>

<username>A. H.<//username><Time>1557728046543<//Time><Rating>1<//Rating><review>I went in there for pain in my neck and sternum and was told I probably have allergies and should use nosespray. Didn't feel well taken care of and went to the ER the next morning. I was diagnosed with pericarditis ( inflammation of the membrane surrounding the heart with fluid buildup) within hours and had to be admitted. The answering of the way too many questions on their ipads took longer than the nurse practitioner looked at me and they obviously don't help. Wouldn't go back or take a family member there ever.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Review>I cannot say enough positive about Northbay Urgent care in vacaville.  I was able to set up an appointment in advance.  I was greeted immediately upon entering.  Decorated quite charming.  Keuig coffeemaker.  Bottles of water.  Very clean.
Danara at the reception desk is awesome.  Kind. Friendly.  Accurate.
Zues did my vitals, very friendly, asked if he could get me water.  Could he do anything to make me more comfortable.
Curt waited and he and zues checked on me often during my nebulizer treatment.  Had a chest xray and went back to my room to await results.
Ms.kaur, the NP was kind, thorough, and helpful.
This office is be a shining example of care and compassion, and teamwork.  I was thoroughly impressed.  I wish I could get you all a raise in pay.  GOD BLESS.<//Review>< pictures>

Went there because they said they took Tricare.  I looked online and called before we got there, and asked the person at the desk. All said they took it. A month later I get a letter from Tricare that the Urgent Care rejected their payment and they were sending me a check to give to them. I went to their office and they said for me to deposit the check in my account and pay the difference between the Tricare amount and the bill. Apparently that's what they tell everyone with Tricare to do. That's not taking Tricare. Thats me paying for it and getting some money back from Tricare. That's not accepting my insurance like they said they did.< /review>

Other than them not falling procedure if something they have of yours, which has been lost -and you file a police report, this place is great. The people who work here are wonderful. It's just the manager who doesn't know the rules.</Review>

After winning the auction and paying, the package arrived with its contents heavily damaged due to poor packaging. Whole watch movements with dials were wrapped up together without anything to separate them. Dials and hands were ruined as a result. Shattered glass from a watch crystal that broke from poor packaging got all over my floor and table. A large piece of glass got lodged in my finger and I almost had to go to the hospital to get it all out. I cannot return this because I need some of the items to complete repairs. I contacted them beforehand in order to give them a chance to make things right. Instead of handling this situation professionally, they responded with a short message, no apology, and said they only accept a return. They had nothing else to say, ignored everything else I told them in my message, and offered no reasonable reparation.</Text><Resp>None<//Resp></record></dataset><record>

<Review>This place has great people working there and I almost always find something really awesome to buy there.  Got my nice new condition MacBook Pro there for half of what it would cost in a store or God-forbid from Apple.  They have hard drives for really good prices.  Even video games.< /Review>< date>

<review>I have used them several times when I needed a little extra cash quickly. They're always fair with their loans, and take very good care of my stuff while in their possession. The lady manager is vey honest, and I always know I won't get ripped off there like other places do.</review>< Rating>

Ive had plenty of great experiences here. Most definitely best cash exchange business in Chico (mind you Ive been to a few recently in town). Quick process great employees give fair price for your items, that is if going there to do a cash exchange . But also a great shop to look for jewelry. They have a wide variety of anything your looking very affordable . It's worth your time to check there shop out thanks for reading</Review>

<review>This pawn store is laughable. By far Chico’s worst place to get a decent loan. Their business ethics is questionable as well because they try to get customers to leave them positive reviews for 3 crappy dvds. They low ball you no matter the condition of what your item you bring in. They offer about 1/10 of what it’s actually worth even its used quality. The other places in town will offer you more on loans and don’t make disrespectful offers like $10. Then she says they would sell it for $50. Yeah no thanks to Chico Cash Exchange.</review>< rate>

I was there today visiting with a friend from out of town. We were told that they were closing and it was 3:25 on a Saturday! Website states 4 oclock. The man in his early 30's just wanted us to leave! Was it because we seemed to be just browsing? Rude and poor businessman! Learn respect!<//Review>

This is a great pawnshop. The employees are knowledgeable and friendly, and the selection of inventory is surprisingly large for such a small shop.

Also, if you ever need to sell or pawn an item, this is the place. Their prices are more than fair, based on my experience of other pawn shops. I sold them some old broken jewelry and made WAY more than I had expected. They explained the whole process to me and seemed very honest throughout the whole transaction. All in all, I would recommend this place to anyone who needs to come up with a little bit of cash or who wants a good deal on a guitar, piece of jewelry, etc.<//text>

You guys are honestly the worst pawn shop or even store for that matter that I have ever been to. I recommend you guys get your head on straight. For anyone reading this do NOT waste your time on this joke.< /Text>

This place is the epitome of what pawn shops have been notoriously known for. (Not the ones on tv) bad vibes in this place, why isn't law enforcement doing something about these greedy people bringing more stolen items from innocent people. They should pay an extra tax  or watched closer by the government to protect our stuff and stop enabling meth heads to buy more drugs!!< /text><Name>Walter Burns< /Name>< Rate>

Professional con/rip off artist's, they will offer you less then 15% for great prime merchandise!
Please be very cautious, try the other pawn shops in town before this one. Also a reviewer said they offer 3 DVDs for a positive review, I didnt get that offer personally though I'm sure my response to the workers offer to rip me off didnt make him feel the need to offer me anything, I wasnt very nice in my response. In any event, I didnt see evidence but there are 23 reviews that show this is their only review they have ever made, which is pretty lucky for this pawn shop if they are so good 23  out of 69 reviewers/people have went out of their way to create an account and review them! I think not more likely its bored employees trying to get an attaboy or a pat on the back from the corrupt scamming owner or people being offered 3 DVDs to give a positive review. but if true this pawn shop is a complete nuisence/nightmare for the people of chico.</Review>

I've been to several T-Mobile stores for questions regarding plans and service. Many weren't good until I found this location.

I've never had T-Mobile until I went here a month ago as I wanted to get it for my mom. I purchased the $15 dollar plan. The service is outstanding. The rep who helped me out, her name is Issy. She got my mom on the T-Mobile plan within fifteen minutes. Issy is friendly and helpful. She answered all my questions.

I felt safe inside. They explained the rules when I entered regarding wearing masks and social distancing.

I prefer this T-Mobile Location. Issy is a great rep. I recommend her.<//review>

The customer service here is not great. I've been to the store twice in the past two weeks since moving from Texas and Jorge is so unhelpful. My phone was shut off today again and I asked for a paper copy of the bill, I supplied my ID and they still wouldn't give me the account number  or any information because the bill was in my wife's name (she died in August). My name was also on the account with my phone number and they were more than willing to take my payment. My friend went to the store with me to help me because I am disabled, when she asked him to speak up because she is deaf and told him she would stand back in order to read his lips he refused to pull down his mask siting the cameras saying he would get in trouble. He then walked over to the other clerk and they spoke Spanish and he came back. I called the store in Texas and they were more than willing to help me from 1,400 miles away.  I won't be going back to this store again.<//Text>

They were helpful when selling and giving you the phone, but when processing their promotion was a disaster. Already spoke to their customer support and couldn't help me. I've done what they ask in my part and the waiting game to process till it the claim period. Now, I'm stuck with a large bill from my previous carrier. I am glad I got the phone, but the scheme and con afterward has hurtled my pocket.
I wasn't late on my payments or such. I did what they asked me to do and still told me they couldnt help me, but told that I'm getting the best deal they can offer.
Thanks T-Mobile!<//text>

<review>This is the worst tmobile store the customer service is horrible.  I just went in to add a phone this girl gave me some B.S to call 611 on my phone to handle it. So I called 611 they had no idea what she was talking about. And the manager stood there just as lost I really think they were both high which dosent surprise me is that was the case. I walked out and yes i called corporate to complain this shouldn't happen.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

The staff at this store is so helpful and make you feel like you're a part of the family. That is why I rated 5 stars. Even though I'm usually there because of something annoying to do with my phone, going into this store is never a chore. I've been to other T-mobile stores where the staff is incompetent and frustrating. Not this store!!
T-mobile as a company, however... Very frustrating. There's always something wrong. For example, they temporarily canceled a line because of "lack of payment," but it had been paid and when we went to this lovely store, they were able to help us out. Dumb stuff like that always seems to happen, at least once every two weeks. I'm new to T-mobile, so I'm hoping that eventually, all the issues will end.<//Text>

< Review>
The staff at this store is top notch! Everyone from the store managers all the way down to the sales reps are awesome. They always make me and my family feel right at home when we come in. They are the reason we've chosen to stick with T-Mobile. Thanks guys!<//Review>

<Text>My visits to TMobile are always nice. The staff is always very friendly. My only complaint would be the amount of time everything always takes. I tend to plan to be there for an hour or two, but I usually only go when I need to upgrade or replace a phone... I feel like I'm OK with the time for the activity, but I'm sure there's faster / better ways to do it.</Text><Response>None<//Response>< Name>

<review>Stay away you are better off buying online. I wanted to return a cell phone because the battery drains even when not in use and I was punished with a restocking fee and it turns out they don't have enough money to give me. Now I have to deal with these @#%$&$*^ again.< /review><gmapID>0x80e8291833697e87:0xe7c1baf4691398a<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>So far hugely helpful and friendly. They ported my ATT number over, paid me for the old phone, and have unlimited 3G. The staff was friendly at this store and Matt especially was very knowledgeable about disentangling myself from ATT. 5/5, would port over again.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<review>The service sucks. The manager is a complete ass and the help there sucks.  When i went in the man helping me was busy texting on his phone when he was supposed to be helping me with my phone. Would not recommend it. Have seen the staff lose their temper very easily. Horrible training and would recommend that tmobile the corporation go in and really have a serious talk with them. All of them are complete a holes down in that store.<//review><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<text>I Highly recommend going to this store because all of their representative, specially Matthew is very helpful and professional, unlike to the one in Madera Rd. which is very immature and unprofessional. If you're looking to add a line or for some accessories to your mobile devices, don't hesitate to go to this store and look for Matthew.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80e8291833697e87:0xe7c1baf4691398a</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Horrible service.  Just spoke to Tarashid almost drove to best buy to get at&t but Beth over the phone saved the day.  STAY AWAY FROM THERE STORE. never had a good experience here really never have none of them product knowledge nor the desire to deal with other humans. They seem racist against white people !!

< Review>
Horrible experience, went there for signal booster he asked for my info. after like 3mins looking at the computer I was told it was a $300 up front. he then put an unhappy face when I told him that TMO care told me it was only a $25 deposit fee, and said he was going to check with his manager, 9 mins went by he came back out and told me NO, that they didn't have it in stock anyway so to call TMO care again and have them send me one instead (which I did I just have to pick it up at a different store)

Thank goodness I don't have to deal with this store and feel sorry for those who do

unless is a life and death situation I will go back other than that they will never see me there again...< /Review>

< Review>
I had heard of this spot from family members who live nearby, but I didn't get to try it until after the pandemic. The restaurant itself is very clean and sanitized. The staff is friendly and they work quickly. The menu isn't large, but the quality of the food more than compensates. The pozole is my personal favorite, very flavorful and the best you can get outside of homemade. Burritos are huge and generously garnished and they have Mexican coke which washes it down nicely! I will continue to support this hidden gem and I hope more people will give it a try and keep this place in business!</Review>

<GmapID>0x80c2b71bf5b4810f:0x25605227ba710071< /GmapID><review>By far the best Mexican food place. I've been going here with my family since I was 12 and still my fav. I recommend the chicken flautas, chicken quesadilla, any and all soups, nacho fries, and literally anything. Pair it with a horchata and it's amazing. Definitely a great go to when cooking during the pandemic isn't ideal or you just don't want to cook. Staff is super nice, never a mean person except some new girl that's terrible and rude. As for food and the family working there that owns it...110% recommend.</review>< Pics>

<review>SO...I am very critical when it comes to Mexican food being that it is my favorite food ever! I've tried many places and none come close, this place has some of the BEST Mexican food I've ever tasted and my daughter even liked the burger she had too!

Newly remodeled, my old spot for the last 20 years is still one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in all of Inglewood. Can't get enough of the chicken enchiladas, red or green. Salsa is hot too... love it.<//text>

<Text>I love Charlie's. It is always filled with friendly faces and the smell of delicious of food. The staff is makes you feel at home. The salsa bar is great, but my favorite are the jalapeño pickled carrots. Favorite dish is the shrimp enchilada combo plate. The chimichangas are HUGE. Other favorites...shrimp cocktail and Chile verde.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Came here on the 4th of July for a quick bite. This is a casual establishment. I ordered the carne asada wet burrito and nachos for the hubby. The burrito was decent and he enjoyed the nachos. Bathroom on premises. Friendly and fast service.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMhaiI4ilGT0o9PIqZxx8nOlcPWWINEQodgDDb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMro0pAiFbH_p3GkJKbYbpoTWEYx3aZoOC3dvb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c2b71bf5b4810f:0x25605227ba710071< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Pretty solid mexican. Our go to spot when we want something quick, cheap and consistent. It may not be the best, but it's good. I always get the ribs, my fave. The bf has had multiple items and he always says it's great. Price is always right and the salsa for the chips is spicy and tasty!  I love their salsa! It's close to home and we know it will not disappoint if this is where we go.< /text>

This restaurant is a hidden gem. Is not fancy BUT the food is excellent , prices are affordable, customer service super friendly. Family owned and is been there for years. My kids love going there specifically to eat the carne asada nachos. I highly recommend it.< /Review>

Arguably my favorite greasy spoon Mexican spot in the Inglewood area. Everything tastes great here, whether you're ordering a Charly's burritos, their giant nachos, or any one of the combination plates.The service is great as well, as the employees here are really nice and friendly.  I usually order lunch or dinner to go (call in for quick orders, usually 5-10 minutes), but the restaurant is also a nice, small place to dine-in.</review>

Just as delicious as the other location which closed on the June 30th 2019. I'm so happy that I can still get this high quality authentic Mexican food because the other one closing hurt my heart for 5 minutes since this one is only 5 minutes away 😆 - lots of seating plus highchairs for the kids, television and even a jukebox! Nice and clean and easy to find right on the corner of Manchester and Inglewood 😍 my official go-to for my Prego cravings 😍<//Review>

Humble little spot! really good Mexican food!Homestyle food, i highly recommend this place.  The have menudo and Birria every weekend ! a must sooooo good. their taquito plate, is really good too. you cant go wrong with anything you order. The owner is super nice and friendly,  so is the staff, however they can use a little more training at waiting tables. Is a semi quiet spot,  you can hear yourself eat lol.. i highly recommend!< /Review>

This place sets the bar really high for the pretenders. Deliciously refreshing micheladas. Best "supreme nachos" charly nachos. The nacho fries are the best. Great conversation.

This is my favorite childhood Mexican restaurant that has been around for years. I always order a chicken nacho with extra sour cream and jalapenos. I live near Palm Springs but my husband and I will drive 2 hours away just for their Nacho and wet burrito...<//text>

<Text>Hoee in the wall with great flavor! Authentic food and friendly staff. Menu is straight and to the point. Mexican sabor con amor. Would give 5 stars but the restroom is always dark light and sketch. That said I have never had a bad burrito here. Try the enchiladas or camarones Al Diablo for spicy treat.< /Text>< Pictures>

I order two large campechanas to go, I always love them but this time instead  of loving them I was so disappointed becuase they didn't have nothing , I ended up drinking a cup of clamato with two shrimps inside not even enough  onions  or tomatoes to eat, for $30 I rather buy the clamato and it will be cheaper.< /Text>

This is a part of San Francisco history as a bakery.  There is a great amount bread products here, besides the variety of Sourdough loaves, there is the chocolate chip loaf, dessert items and sandwiches you can order.  They have also Papa Steve's Sourdough Pizza.  This is a rectangular shape pizza with a choice of toppings, this should be ordered 20 minutes ahead of time so go on the Boudin's online to order this before you pickup your bread. Normally a photo is attached to my reviews but I was to hungry to photograph the wonderful items, but next time which is soon I will show you their products.  Stay safe and enjoy.<//Text>

<time>1540181329645<//time><Rating>5< /Rating><text>Good bakery products, from very historic old San Francisco "sourdough bread" origins. Sadly this bakery has recently been shut down and the bakers were sent packing! 🤔 As of October 2018, the neighborhood retail store is still open - selling product from the Wharf location of Boudin Bakery.  So are we to be seeing the beloved old building sold for new Condominimums complex in the Richmond District?? 😞.<//text>< pics>

The most delicious clam chowder in a bread bowl. Super cheap and easy lunch or dinner. I always pick up an extra sourdough loaf too. So happy I found it tucked away on the side of Geary.<//Review>

Great sourdough breads!  Social distancing, line looks long because 1 customer in the bakery at a time. Join their membership and get a free 1lb round free a month or apply the value to more expensive items!<//Review>

It's a small bakery. You can buy sourdough bread in many shapes and flavors. And they have one of the best clam chowders around and all for a very decent price. It's a definite guilty pleasure.

And best of all, since no one really knows about it, you can drop in quickly, grab what you need and not have to fight a crowd like at the fisherman's wharf or at union square.it is for us locals. Seems like it is really a location for the commercial bakery but they serve bread and chowder on the side. Yeah!!!<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGROM1mkrlQCC1NF8udKqq_-cDNk4JDZXL6c1E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x8085873dfb0f7623:0x6953f0568d7b36de<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

~This is a really awesome satellite bakery of the Boudin Family and I really love being able to get such fresh bread just blocks from where I live. A true San Francisco treasure. 😊~</Review>

<Time>1562211483467</Time><Rating>4< /Rating><Review>Boudin is basically a one-stop shop for all your bread needs but can also serve as a sandwich stop, coffee break or a quick treat.  I am a huge fan of all breads other than sourdough but that has never been a problem here.  The Asiago and Olive loaves are two of my favorites and if I am having a party they will cut a baguette or two up for me in their bread slicer.  It saves me time for other cooking tasks.  I wish they had bread available earlier.  I have been there at 6am and there were no loaves ready at that time.</Review>< pictures>

Best clam chowder ever! Go for it, and go for a sourdough bread bowl, it’s totally worth it! Also, I really like their tuna salad sandwich, and their bagels (who doesn’t like bagels, anyway?), and their banana muffins... Love. This. Place.< /text>

I looked from the exterior to see a menu posted on the window and entered and looked at the menu at the counter, NO SIGNS STATING THE BUY 1 GET 1 FREE DEAL!  I asked the cashier if the chowder is on special.  She said in a near whisper "Oh, it's buy 1 get 1 free today", as if she didn't want the customers behind me to hear.  I got the chowder for my wife, but got the impression that the shop wasn't interested in publicizing the sale.< /Review>< gmap_id>

Only French bread  bakery within San Francisco city limits for the simple reason that it's consistently excellent quality has stood the test of time. They make a variety of breads including sweet as well sourdough bread, rolls, a few types of cookies & danish. During holidays they bake some special breads & they sell coffee & teas. They're also known for their clam chowder in an edible bread bowl.</Review>

Entrance off 10th Ave.  Get here early for the best selection of bread baked on premises.  Other items like croissants are brought in, so are not as fresh.  Their french roast coffee was good,.  Soup was hearty and delicious, but a little too salty for me.</Review>

I have been a loyal customer of Boudin for my entire life, however due to recent changes made by Boudin organization I will not be purchasing anymore bread from this establishment. The fact that you don’t make late baked bread anymore on the 10th and Geary location is disappointing. I’m not sure whose decision was this to transfer all the baking to the fisherman’s wharf location but it clearly alienates the locals from being able to purchase good bread anymore. The fisherman’s Wharf location also doesn’t have a late bake, and the bread is more expensive for the same loafs do to tourists.</Text>

<review>The chowder here is off the charts delicious. I walk the 12 blocks from my apartment just for a loaf of bread. On Sunday nights, they bake fresh bread, so if you walk by at around then, it is just wonderful.< /review>< pics>

<Text>Boudin is famous for their sourdough bread loaves and claim chowder bread bowls.  This particular location on Geary is no different.  The primary purpose for this location is to actually make the bread so there is a big warehouse space in the back with ovens etc.  In the front where customers enter, it is really just a counter to order from.  They have a small menu of food items, a pastry shelf of goods and of course all of the bread offerings you could want.  They also have coffee, sandwiches and some other assorted items.  There are a few tables on the sidewalk out front but this may be best as a take out kind of place.  The sourdough bread here is tough to beat.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<Text>If you just want bread, this is a place to go.  I like this location because I don't have to go to the other side of the city to get good bread.  In, out, and done.

Also, it's one of the few locations that will slice the bread for you.

This cafe is small, especially compared to the one at Fisherman's Wharf.  It has two tables outside, and the menu is the chowder and two sandwich options.  This location, though, is the main bakery, and the smell of sourdough bread is strong and heavenly!< /Text><Rate>4</Rate><gmapID>0x8085873dfb0f7623:0x6953f0568d7b36de</gmapID>< pics>

Extremely famous for a reason. Boudin bread is some of the best I have ever tasted and fairly priced. I would recommend to do all of your bread/pastry shopping here.<//review>

This is not your larger Boudin Bakery. The selection is limited and only have whatever prepared. The sandwiches are premade and the soup was too thick compared to the Boudin I normally eat at. The bread bowl I received was also crushed on top and looked dark and old. No online ordering of this place as well.</Review>

It was such a nice surprise to find this small café just off Geary.  Knowing how good Boudin's sourdough bread is, we went in to see what they had.

The store was bigger than I expected and my wofe and I were acknowledged and greeted cheerfully by the lady behind the counter while she was serving the other customers.

There were two sandwiches (Italian or turkey) on the counter on display and both looked delicious.   Since my wife is an "off-the-plane" Italian, we decided to try their Italian deli sandwich.

There were many loaves of bread available inside too!

There are three tables outside on the sidewalk:  two small and one large.  They were taken but one of them was soon available.

It was such a pleasant surprise to find Boudin out in the Avenues and they didn't dissapoint.  We will be back!</Review>

<Review>Omar and staff go above and beyond to accommodate the needs of others. We catered a funeral reception the day after Thanksgiving. The restaurant was closed, but they opened for our family of 20. The food was excellent as well. We will be forever grateful to El Camino Mexican Grill.< /Review><response>None</response><Time>1575078007707</Time></record>

Only the tortilla chips and salsa was good. Hospitality was amazing but it's more of a texmex restaurant. Food wasn't to die for. I won't go back. People must like it because they threw a party there.< /text>

Once that was taken care of. The food not great rice was undercooked beans okay but you expect those to be good they are the staple to any Mexican restaurant.<//Review>< Pics>

<review>Friendly nice cozy place to eat Mexican food. Their Mexican buffet has all the antojitos you desire. They had cafe de la hoya with the right amount of canela, sopes, Chile Verde, Chile Colorado, machaca con huevo the food was great. I would go back.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Finally decided to give the place a try. Food was salty and not authentic "homemade" abuleta style.  The menudo was like from a can, salty water with mostly harmony. Worst menudo ever=(.  I got sick from eating the fish cerviche.  The sopes   were rock hard and with barely any meat.  Will not be returning again. Bueno Gustos has way better food.<//Review>

Worst experience in my life. Came in, and 30 minuts in to eating didn't get any service what's so ever. There was only 4 table's including my wife and I. When I asked why I was never asked what we wanted to drink there reply was that the meal doesn't come with drinks and that that was extra. I know that I'm not looking to save money, I'm looking for good food and over all good service. I was so discussed and apoled at the end of it all I couldn't enjoy my meal anymore and didn't wait to get any more bad service we left.<//text>

Very good service, very good food and I've been back several times I'm a food critic and for all those people out there that like good food and mine you I'm 450 lb and I didn't get there by not eating good food. Try it out and put a smile on your own face big Jeff La Puente.</Text>

They charged me $8 for a kids meal taco and fries instead of the menu price $5. Found a hair in our chips. I was not impressed...front table was full of catering supplies made the restaurant look messy.<//Review>

THIS place has the heart and soul of the owner and his wife.  You can taste the love in it.  The soups are wonderful....I try to go and eat their soup on rainy days.  They have homemade Jamaica, Orchata and Aguas Frescas.....Highly recommend!<//review>

Found this place by chance while walking on the city with a friend. We were actually lost looking for a nearby bar where our friends were and ended up finding Local Color. The colors of the art inside and the people playing games got our attention. We entered and stayed there for 15-30min because it was almost closing, amazing place for those who enjoy street art, colors, graffiti and art in general.

Would love to visit again with more time.< /review>< username>

It's a great place to hang out! How often do you get to paint the flames on Thoros's flaming sword to chill? You could play a few board games or street fighter, read a few books or just watch the artists at work.</Review>

Cool spot still seem to be figuring out what to do with the large space but you can play ping pong, chill on couches or draw on the wall. Plus some cool art to walk around and they talk about maybe. Showing movies sometimes.</text>< Pictures>

This is such a special place. It quickly became one of my favorite spots in the city to casually check out; even though I'm on their mailing list and know of their events beforehand, something is always going on at local color. This is where you support your local artists. There is a little something for everyone, even if you never considered yourself to be someone who enjoys art. Do yourself a favor and stop by this blessed place. You won't regret it.< /review>

(Translated by Google) Excellent artistic space, you can establish a personal relationship with painters as there are 28 exclusive spaces for brush artists; cultural events are also organized where diversity reigns and camaraderie is the base. Definitely a place to visit in downtown Sanjo. Drop, you will like it.

I couldn't recommend this place enough. They found me an amazing deal on 6 tires for my Class A RV, and worked with my schedule to get me in right away. Super helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly staff. I wouldn't go anywhere else. Thanks for the beautiful tires!</Text>

Super friendly staffs and technicians. They took real good care of my truck problems and charged me super fairly. Most importantly I felt they really treat clients like their family. I’m so happy that I found this shop here OTR in California. And of course 18 wheeler accessible!< /text>

<text>First time using Precision Truck Tire.  As a RV class A owner, I drove to his shop to insure they could handle my RV on site.  Wow, what a giant place.  Met Raul the owner who took the time to walk me around his warehouse. Impressive !! Took the RV back and experienced staff quickly removed my tire and inspected for leaks. This business is top notch.  Fast, professional service at a very reasonable price.  Highly recommended.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80dcb78cd7a6e15f:0x5caca29f78c349bc</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I don't normally write reviews after I received a service that I believe was fair and a fair value. However, If i feel I got cheated or bad service I will blow up the internet. I loaned my Motor home to my son to go to the river last week. Coming home near Palm Springs on the 10 freeway he had a right front tire tire blow out on the 10 freeway. After contacting five tow companies to help tow me off the freeway to a local tire shop I was quoted 2 hour minimum at $250.00 per hour. I'm a police officer and people who take advantage of people in trouble should wear a mask to hide their identity with that kind of price. Since the tire was destroyed we limped it on the wide shoulder off the freeway at 5 mph. and parked it at a flying J gas station at that off ramp. I contacted a Parkhouse tire store and was Quoted $524.00 dollars for a tire. I decided to wait till morning and looked up a local tire shop in Corona. Precision Truck Tire Service. I spoke to Raul Merin and explained my situation . He loaned me a used tire to get my motor home and told me he would give me a deal on a new tire. $44.00 dollars later I was at his shop. We discovered the tires were 10 years old and weather checked. All six needed to be changed. While Raul was getting me a quote I googled Americas tire, Goodyear tire in Corona, Canyon Tire service and Pete's road side tires. Raul beat the cheapest quote for 6 tires by $672.00 dollars. When I picked up the Motor home the following day not only did I have 6 new tires but Raul had his detailer polish my wheels that hadn't shined for years and I thought they were flat aluminum . This type of care has not been around for years. Good customer service is hard to find these days. Most shops want to get you in and out and get paid as quickly as possible. At the conclusion of my visit I noticed several framed plaques on Raul's wall that were from local police departments that he had sponsored golf tournaments. What most  people don't know we have these events to earn money for several of our community charities and we like supporting the local golf ball manufacture with balls that we need to replace at the conclusion of the event. I'm down to just 15 lost balls. If you are looking for good service, and honest prices you found the right place.< /review>

I recently got a blowout on the side of the freeway and I called them just wondering if they were to service a personal vehicle and come to find out they do! They are way faster than AAA and mount the new tire on the spot no matter what time it is .  Appreciate you guys a lot thank you.</Text>< user>

<Text>I purchased a diesel pusher motor home that needed new 22.5 tires. A friend suggested Presision Truck Tire Service. Raul the owner was very knowledgeable, and I could tell he wanted to give me the best tire for my application. The shop is very impressive with plenty of room to handle my large 40’ coach. They even polished the aluminum wheels making them new again! I really liked the fact that Raul walked me out to show me the great job his tech did. I could tell he is very proud of the work they do. Another bonus was they beat the other two quotes I had. I highly recommend.<//Text></record>

<Text>I was looking for new tires because mine were inevitably going to give up on me. A friend recommended Precision Truck Tire Service here in Corona where he said they had quality tires at very reasonable prices. Sure enough they did, and I was very happy on the outcome of my new tires. They got me back on the road rapidly within a small time frame. I would recommend this service to my friends and family!<//Text>< Rating>

I'm with McGrath's Catering. Tuesday a valve stem problem resulted to a flat tire on our 4500 Chevy Box truck. While everybody was closed and closing, they were able to send Manuel out to the rescue. He had the right equipment and skills to get us back on the road. Before and after hours...they are the only ones to call!</text>

<review>This place did me right!! I flatted out on the freeway then my spare flatted out on me 15 minutes after changing the tire... called my buddy and he referred these guys to me 24 hour service at 2am. Salvador came through within 30 minutes to Mira Loma where I was at. Good service replaced my tires on the spot and went back a few months later to get a set of 4 new tires and the owner even gave me a deal. Legit place.

<review>They are a bit slow as they are very crowded and a popular place to eat, but they’ve got a wide variety of delicious sandwiches that are gluten free, vegan, or vegetarian. They also have options only available at Stonestown which is a nice touch.<//review>< pics>

<date>1614567947750<//date><Name>Nikolai Bashkirov</Name><review>The worst Ike’s I’ve ever had. A Subway quality sandwich, no love included, and they forgot to put me a candy too. Honestly, it wasn’t really a sandwich but rather a mess wrapped in a piece of paper. If you want to enjoy a decent Ike’s, just drive down to Serramonte (Bonus point: the sandwiches are also a bit cheaper there)

Updated: +1 star for company’s customer service. It feels like they really care.< /review></record>

<Review>Pretty good sandwiches, usually has a bit of sweetness due to slaw or other ingredients. Price of 10 and up can be worth depending on your tastebuds. Workers are awesome and the place is looking nice. Place looks kind of dead at certain times, I mean makes sense when you charge a lot. But the food ain't bad, just the price vs other places, go if you got the dough.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1572911942073, 'text': "Steven, Thanks for stopping by and for the feedback:) See you soon for more stellar sandwiches at our San Francisco Ike's Sandwiches location!\n\nLove,\nIke’s"}<//response>< gmapID>

So many nooks and crannies you are sure to find your comfortable hangout spot. Rigoberto Menchu on the terrace level is the hidden gem. What looks like a comfortable fireplace lounge really goes up 5 stories to the inside of one of the pyramids. You can not tell what might be going on up there from the bottom level. Several areas have phone charging stations. The game room in the basement is always a good getaway. The depot has live music two nights a week and get connected to the calendar of events to stay connected to campus.< /Text>

I love Ike’s sandwiches but sis this place is not it 🗿. They messed up my online order without an apology and didn’t keep me updated about what happened to my sandwich. And manager had an attitude towards me and another customer. Their sandwiches taste amazing but the employees are a big no for me.<//Text>

<Review>There is a pub inside, which is perfect to drink at in case you are stressed out or beat by an ecstatic Android, to get alcoholic and back to feeling again.

<Rate>1</Rate><review>monstrosity of a nail salon, is unorganized and totally unprofessional.  This was their second chance  from me and they horribly failed once again.  I booked an appointment before and they had me wait 45 minutes AFTER my set and booked appointment time block to even get me started. This time was the same occurrence but this time they were going to make me wait close to 1 HOUR after my set appointment time! This place needs to get ORGANIZED ASAP.  Do not even try setting an appointment here. I happily booked an apt at crown royal nails on ALLEN ROAD and they have yet to dissapointed me :)
May you all not have the same unnecessary experience that I had.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1620677513405, 'text': "Dear amy's kitchen #1\n\nWe would like to apologize for the extended wait time even though you had an appointment.

I love this salon!  Linda is my favorite and does an excellent job on my tootsies...EVERYTIME.  She has a gentle touch, is very thorough in removing all dead skin, and gives a perfect calf massage.

I highly recommend Princess Nails & Spa so much that even though I've moved to Highland Knolls, it's still worth the trip.</Text>

<text>I got a set of acrylics and the nail tech was very very rude. On multiple occasions she would yell to her co workers and it was very annoying. I didnt appreciate her attitude neither. She kept shaking her head and acting annoyed because the hand rest kept moving. If she did not want it to move get it screwed in
Or glued down. Beside that it was good. If you go i recommend the male nail tech. He was very nice,  patient and overall very good at nails.</text>< time>

<Review>I went in for a manicure and pedicure. The lady that “greeted” us looked very angry and was not very friendly but because I was using a gift certificate I had to stay. A different woman gave me my pedicure. During the pedicure I could not relax because she kept digging deep into the side of my toe. After many pedicures where this usually feels great, this time was very painful. I just couldn’t wait to get it over with until the leg massage began which I did enjoy! I then had my manicure which also was nice. When I left, my toe was sore but I thought it would feel better later. The next day not only did my manicure begin to peel but my toe was swollen. I have never had an ingrown toenail but I think I may have one now. Two days later I have absolutely no paint on my fingernails and my toe is swollen and oozing. I think she cut my toenail and tried to dig out the rest but couldn’t get ahold of it so she just left it or she cut my skin that has now caused an infection. Either way it has caused my toe to swell and I now have to go to the doctor. There are plenty of shops like this around town! I suggest choosing a different one.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

She didnt fill my whole nail and blamed me when she never did it right to begin with. She fricken burned me multiple times with the filet and then wouldn't fix her mistakes. I have to go to another salon to get them fixed. I'm never going back.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

<review>I got my eyebrows waxed here, nothing fancy but it seemed clean. The woman was very nice but also pretty rough, she pushed my head back and forth and gave me a quick coarse face massage at the end. But my eyebrows turned out very well (which I am really picky about), so I would go back.< /review>< Rate>

She kept cutting into my skin and after I told her three times that she was hurting me and telling her to stop she finally moved on.  I have a big cut on my toe (from her) and can't wear closed toed shoes.  None of my toenails/fingernails are uniform in length.  Some are short, some are SUPER SHORT.

Perfect spot to have a glass of wine or beer with a friend and enjoy a menu with lots of options. From healthy salads to rich desserts, there is an option for everyone in your group. Don’t wait in the line, download the app and order from your table. Met four friends here for lunch and the food was delivered quickly.</review>

Delicious healthy food. We dined in at the Aliso Viejo location for the first time, grilled salmon was yummy but lukewarm my husband tried the grass-fed beef which he enjoyed but his was lukewarm too. That was the only thing negative I have. We'll try again maybe better luck at a different location.</Text>

We tried Urban Plates tonight and it was awesome!  The food was great!  We chose the “plates” line rather than the salad or sandwiches line. You can choose from delicious meats like steak, chicken, sea bass, salmon, and turkey meatloaf. Then you get a choice of two delicious sides! Yum!  I had the steak, mashed potatoes, and Brussels sprouts and they were awesome!  The place also serves beer, wine and cocktails!  The food was great!  I will be back!</review>

The sandwiches were amazing! I'm not the biggest fan of coleslaw but it compliments the sandwich very nicely. I got the medium which is pretty spicy and my boyfriend got the mild. He said it was pretty spicy for mild so beware if you are not a fan of spicy. There is an option with no spice at all. I will definitely be coming back.< /Text>

So delicious!  I was doing a detox and was struggling to find things to eat.  This was the perfect place to come.  I had a delicious salad, so good in fact that after I was done I went back and got their Moroccan chicken to go.  Simple dishes but with excellent layered flavor.</Text>

<Text>What an absolutley great place for a bite to eat! All the produce is local/organic, all their meats and fish are grass fed, cage free, or wild caught- not to mention every single thing they plate for you is made in-house and from scratch.

The portions are very generous, and the great quality ingredients means I can leave pretty full without feeling the lethargy that comes with lower quality ingredients. Yes it's not the cheapest, (i.e. $14.00 for a salad is pretty standard), but you cant beat the quality/quantity and can share servings comfortably.

Ordered a chicken cobb salad, $14.55 after tax. I forgot to take a picture, but their website photos are fairly accurate representation, of what you should expect. Great service, great environment, great everything.

Composition: "UP lettuce blend, grilled free range chicken, organic tomatoes, turkey bacon, avocado, organic egg, blue cheese, organic sprouts - buttermilk dill dressing." (Also comes with bread).

5/5 would recommend, the dressing is amazing! Even had some left over to enjoy.< /Text>< pictures>

Ok still love this place I did realize they did change the actual muffin to a thinner muffin which is great! They did raise the price of the zaatar and friends which is not to great! Also the zaatar and friends is really lacking feta cheese now! I would really recommend you call ahead to order if not you will be waiting for a while</Text>

<review>First time there about a week ago. Heard that there was no indoor smoking, which is great. And that the food was great, and it was!
Super hipstery, as to be expected. They have vegan options. Overall, good vibes. Just wish they had more seating... would be great to have a large gathering of friends to hang... but it was pretty busy for a Sunday evening.
Great soda btw!< /review>< userid>

What can I say 2020 has been a rough year. Round two of quarantine and money is tight. We have food allergies and can barely afford to put food on the table these days let alone having food allergies. We are so grateful places like Urban Plates exist and work with delivery services to make sure our family is fed without having to be at risk. The staff truly are essential workers on the front lines of probably one of the more difficult jobs customer service wise and don’t get enough credit.
We have been ordering Urban Plates quite often during these times and our last order was a bit confusing due to the door dash menu restrictions and Cami went out of her way to give us a call three times to make sure we had our order correct and even left us a really kind note in the bag in regard to our allergy.

This is an example of going out of your way when nothing seems to be going your way in the world to make someone’s day just a little bit better. Five stars. I would give more if I could.<//review>

Outside dining area has misters and shaded socially distanced tables. Food is brought to u outside after youve ordered inside where it is air-conditioned. Chicken club was great. Whatever they garnished the sandwich with really made that sandwich.<//Text>

<text>This is currently one of my favorite restaurants.  I can eat anything of the menu knowing that it will be fresh and that it will taste really good.

Their plates always look vibrant and that's thanks to the variety in their menu.
The restaurant itself looks very modern and their outdoor seating is always clean and at room temperature, as they have heaters outside running when its cold.

Their service it's unmatched, always friendly and courteous, and if there is anything wrong with your order or food, they are there to make it right.

Their juice bar "Urban Replenishers" is a really great option for those looking to drink healthier things. The green super food is one of their best sellers since they make them all from scratch. I've tried all of them and they are all equally good, it really depends on what your mood is, I found that I can always drink the cantaloupe/mango and also the green tea, those are my two favs.

If they had a rewards program, it would be amazing, I know I would take advantage of it.

They also sell alcohol. But I'm not a big drinker.

Bring your family, friends or even coworkers. This is a really great place to eat.

Tip: if you order the chimichurri steak, have the chimichurri sauce on the side and not on the top, if they put it on the top... by the time you sit at your table your steak will be cold, their chimichurri sauce its served very cold.<//text>< username>

A real and healthy alternative to the traditional American food you just might find everywhere. Lots of vegetables, soups and rice cooked in different ways. Let's call it a restaurant with Mediterranean food. My hot wife and I enjoyed the food here.< /Text>

<Text>Urban Plates seems to be a healthier, unique and organic version of a Sizzler. You purchase a meal but it’s cafeteria style. Meaning, you get to see all the options and select from what’s available. Their beverages are especially unique and organic. One that I particularly like is the blueberry soda. Their macaroni and cheese is also to die for, it may seem like a naïveté side option but seriously, it might change your life. They also have nice indoor and outdoor seating. It’s definitely a date night favorite.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrQ1N1EeZYAWzScY4oTQGwsPcs7pItTCAaUYoz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

I have to contain myself from making this place a weekly thing for myself. This is my go-to for deliveries to the office. I like that they are "fast" but not "fast-food". There are options from sandwiches, hot plates or salads... they offer interesting beverages as well. The staff is usually friendly, I have not had any negative experiences here.</Review>

I'd give 1 star for the supervisor who declined to remake my order that was stolen by someone else before I got there. But, I'm giving five stars because of how quickly the general manager corrected her and had my order remade. Thanks GM.</Review>

Healthy, delicious, and they have a wonderful ambiance. Really great place to take friends or family out to for a nice meal. It's a sort of buffet style serving like subway. I especially enjoy their desserts.<//Review>

<Text>Service gets a 5 star but food gets a 4. Calamari and mussels were great starters and reasonably priced. I kept wanting more of the broth from the mussels!!!  The seafood stew was meh. Pretty bland overall with nothing special. Restaurant is very quaint and we had a great seat in the front. Waiter and staff were super attentive. Thank you for a nice meal.

No joke I’m he food is amazing. Its nice to eat a pretty generous amount of food and not feel like a balloon afterwards. Everyone is super nice and helpful there, the only person I got the name of was chef Jeremy who was incredibly friendly and made the experience that much more pleasant.
I can’t stress how tasty the food is and it doesn’t make you feel sick or put you in a food coma. We need more of this.< /Review>

Had a pickup order for 6:30 — but as soon is went in to pick it up, the restaurant was obviously very busy. The ladies working the pickup area were great and did everything to make the (slightly) longer than expected wait great. They were obviously working hard to get everyone taken care of, made sure our order was taken care of, and offered complimentary cookie/drinks while we waited. Thank you!!< /text>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><text>I ordered the antioxidant salad which was really good. I decided to add the baked Salmon thinking that it was wild caught but when it came I noticed it was very pale in color. That's when I asked and I learned they use sustainable Salmon, which basically means farmed. When you do the research on farmed Salmon, you  learn the negatives about it. I am very surprised they don't use wild caught, I assume it's the higher cost which would dip into their profit. The salad and the Salmon were $20 which is a bit high but would've been fine if it was wild caught. I definitely will be back, but will have other proteins instead< /text></record></dataset><record>

We've eaten here fees times and the lines are kind of long and they have an odd way of ordering... It's cafeteria style and sometimes you have a longer wait if you order something that needs to be replaced. The food is good, about what you would expect from a cafeteria maybe a little better. I think I would enjoy it better if I could just order the food in stead of going down a line.... Just my thoughts.< /Text>

Great place to meet friends. Food is great. Home cooking farm to table type food. And don't have to split bills since they have cafeteria style choose/pay<//Text>

<username>brent J</username><Date>1558930153046< /Date><rating>1</rating><Text>This place was good before it changed ownership. The last time I went here with my family for dinner. The chicken was literally unedible and dry as cotton balls. The only thing that was somewhat decent was the steak they were serving. Everything looked like it was left under heat lamps for hours and the salad was alright. I give it one star because you don't charge people high prices for Golden corral or home town buffet quality of food when you're expecting something much better for the price.</Text>< Pics>

I usually get a sandwich when I go. It's pretty tasty, but I'm a bit sad the only options with a sandwich are chips or bread. I'd really love a fruit option!

Cost is going to be a bit more than most places for lunch in the area, but you'll probably feel better after the meal than some others.<//review>

Too 'upscale' for my tastes.  Chicken salad was minimalist and the chicken was tough and hard.  The patio was cold and the chairs uncomfortable.   I don't like paying before eating when confronted with the choice of tip amount.  I gave too much.  Won't return.<//Review>

Really enjoyed the food here. You select your food while in line, put yor food on your tray and then pay. It has a nice atmosphere and the food tasted very good. They have their own soda line, not your standard Coke or Pepsi product lines. Great place for groups, seating inside or outside. Overall, very good place to eat.</Text>

< Review>
Pretty much same Urban Plates as the others I have been to. Definitely an upgrade over the terrible place that was there before, On the Border. I call these kind of places fancy cafeterias, which is what they are. This Aliso location has less turnover of the food, so some of the meats are dried out more so than busier locations. Some of the food is bland. Its OK if you don't feel like cooking on a weeknight. The drinks are overpriced.<//Review>

This place really impressed me with how unique the setup of the restaurant was. The atmosphere was lively, comfortable, and relaxed. The food was also fresh and my poke bowl had the most impressive presentation ive ever seen. As someone who didnt know what to expect, i was blown away! Their cheesecake was AWESOME and the molasses cookie reminded me of childhood. 10/10< /Review>

I normally get the steak salad at Urban Plates which I like very much however on this visit I got the chicken club sandwich which was absolutely delicious. Pair up your entree with a drink and it makes a great place for lunch or for a business meeting. the consistency of the food at Urban Plates is pretty good across at least four locations that I've dined at and this location in Aliso Viejo is not any different.</Review>

Great service and the food is absolutely beautiful and extremely tasteful.  When you eat organic food you have limited options and Urban Plate gives you what you cannot find else where. Hats off to Travis the manager he is very good at decompressing any issues of complaints making your visit exceptional.  I could not express my happiness more if it were not for Travis. Thank you Travis we appreciate your efforts.< /Text>

This place is a great place to eat , I visited this place this September because it was near where I was staying. I also ate at the Irvine location, I prefer that location better . The salad I had here was the barbecue chicken salad, so tasty I ate it all.  I will visit again when I come back to California . Great atmosphere.  Food is delicious and top notch.< /Review>

This is my first visit to an Urban Plates, and it was quite a nice surprise. I had the steak which was tender flavorful and fat-free, and a bowl of the tomato basil soup which was completely off-the-charts good. Definitely will go back<//review>

I like the food here. Organic and grass fed meat, great salads. You can have wine or beer. They have something for any taste. The outside sitting is nice. However, it is not easy to make good food also fast food. The line is a little disorganised, the wait is a little too long even after you began ordering. By the time you get to a table, your food is almost cold. Still, I would come again.<//review>

< Review>
Here's my story,

My girlfriend and I waited in line as the employee took her time to get to us, once she tended us her tone and facial expressions were very bleak. Every topping I told her I wanted to add was like pulling teeth and didn't seem friendly. Soon after we were done with our meal, we get approach by another associate and he asked to follow him to speak with the manager. We briefly explained what happened and the manager comes back with a gift card to give us! He was very generous and kept our business for doing so. 5 stars! ☆☆☆☆☆< /Review>

Great food done in a cafeteria style.  I was impressed with the braised tofu meal.  My significant other had a delicious turkey meatloaf that consisted of two large slabs of meatloaf, grilled Brussel sprouts,  and a mixed vegetable medley.  It was delicious!</Text>

Love the wild caught albacore and the blueberry ginger Limonade.  I picked roasted sprout and rainbow carrot/golden beet for my two sides.
The entire meal is  very tasty and healthy as well! Will definitely come back!< /Text>

Even my kids love this "healthy" place to eat! Lots of great selections, and everyone can select favorite protein and sides. Salads are excellent, and the drink bar has some unique selections for adults and kids.< /review>

I have gotten everything here so it's about time for a review. Today I tried the Antioxidant Salad. I usually despise fruits in my salad but the combination of strawberries and grapes with the blue cheese was amazing. Aside from that I really like their plates. It's pricey for sure, but it's simple and portions are what you should eat. I'm basically paying more for portion control but I'm OK with that. It's clean and somewhat healthy unless you're the mac and cheese guy. I usually go for streat steak and a side of brocollini and brussel sprouts.</Text>

certainly fresh and assume, however to charge 12 Dollars for a salad without any meat is harsh, regardless. a small soup with salad also  12 plus if you want a 'special' soup its 1 Dollar more. arghh but good food!<//text>

Good value, and great for a fast bite before the cinema, but I prefer Stadium the other side of the mall for better food and beer. The food tends to dry out under the lamps (e.g the ribs I had) though the steak was medium rare and surprisingly good.
Tip: the line just inside the door is for the salad (and very slow) - skip round it for a regular plate.<//Text>

Good food, slow service.  They are not responsive to the long lines.  They need to hire a floater to help the stations that are busy.  Again, food is good.  Poorly executed service.</text>

Whoa. This one came as a surprise to me. I'd never heard of it.
The "line" system is straight dumb. However, once you're in and you know what you want, it's easily manageable. Then you stand there, wating for your food (another flaw). Then you get your beautifully arranged plate of food and catch a whiff (of the steak sandwich in my case), and you know it's all worth it.

The food is amazing. The prices are ok. The way you order is dumb. Two thumbs way up< /Review>

I was at the Aliso Viejo location and the staff worked like a well oiled machine on Day 7 of opening!  The beauty of it was that everyone was happy to be there and completely focused on creating a great experience for everyone around them! I spoke to Jessica and she went out of her way to make my first visit special and memorable! The food was amazing! Since I live so close, I can see this being my new favorite hangout! So many different choices of food...salads, sandwiches, pizza and entree dishes...along with excellent sides and cookies and desserts! Great wine selection and some fun juice drinks 🍹 too!

This was our 2nd try at this restaurant. Mediocre both times. Tender Greens is much better. Our sliced chicken was low quality with a lot of fat and grisly and tasted bland. Garlic potatoes were tasty but all of the food that supposed to be hot was barely warm. Albacore was good. Tomatoe basil soup tasted good and was hot enough.< /review>

It's like a cross between subway sandwiches and hometown buffet except the food is almost inedible. Brüssel sprouts: dried out, bitter, gross. Grass fed steak: absolutely no taste except a burned flavor. Ribs: tasted like the meat had gone rancid but luckily it was heavily slathered in some nasty canned sugar sauce. Beet salad: actually ok but was only saved by goat cheese. I observed a handful of patrons just throwing away their mostly uneaten plates. To top it off I watched a drunk illegal alien worker in a white urban plates shirt leering and verbally harassing every single woman/young girl (as young as 10 or 12) walking by him while on break. They must have bribed all the glowing 5 star professional reviewers on yelp. I can't find a reason to ever return here.<//review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Hip and healthy choice for salads and sandwiches. They have large portions and fresh entrees. Aside from salads and sandwiches, they offer soups, roasted veggies, pasta, flatbreads, desserts and other lunch/dinner platters. I recommend the chicken Cobb salad, any of the roasted veggies, hummingbird cake and cheesecake. If you’re thirsty, sample one of their homemade “replenishers,” kombucha, wine or beer. They also offer organic and vegetarian/vegan options. Be aware that the salad line can get very long during rush hours so plan your time accordingly. There is indoor and outdoor patio seating with water misters for those hot California days. This has become a regular spot for my friends and I, we never get sick of it! We will be back again soon!< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80dcef4d5eee74eb:0x3086dff1c878f69<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>
