I took my little dog Tecca for a bath and nails trimming and I love how patient they were. She also came out happy and jumping, very different from a previous grooming experience, so I know they treated her well. And whatever they wash the dogs with smells super good! 😉 Thank you Bed&Biscuits!</Review>

Two of my pups graduated and are now wonderful canine citizens. My youngest is in school now at Bed and Biscuits and is better mannered at home already and so very excited to get to go back to school each morning.

Thank you Bed and Biscuits for taking such good care of my kids!!!!</text>< Pictures>

<review>On oasis of canine awesomeness.  My two pups visited for day care and came home happy and tired.  The service from drop off to pick up is all smiles & helpful.  To get a digital report of how they did with photos at the end of the day was an unexpected delight.  I can see they took good care of my babies.</review>< response>

My shepherd/Alaskan husky mix LOVED daycare at this place! Every time I picked him up, he was all smiles and wags. We've had bad experiences at other places before, so finding Bed and Biscuits was a godsend. One of the many things I dearly miss about living in Santa Cruz is being able to take him somewhere that I know he'll be as well cared-for as possible. The dogs have so much to do during the day, and the crew will text pictures of your dog playing, which is another peace-of-mind aspect. I love and miss this place so much, as does Indiana Jones!!</Review>

Bed and Biscuits has amazing customer service!  They answer your phone calls or return the call promptly.  And, they have taken great care of my sweet pup when she is there for boarding or doggy daycare.  They genuinely care that she is well taken care of!<//Text>

They Always have the best customer service on the phone and in person!! My miniature Aussie always looks amazing after her baths and grooming.  She will feel super soft and smell so clean.  Love the white and shiny to brighten up her white and silver in her coat.  You can see that the staff truly cares for your animal as if it were their own! They always have new toys and treats as well as homemade frozen treats!! Forever a customer here! My pup and I Absolutely love Bed and Biscuits!!!</text>

My little corgi LOVES Bed and Biscuits, and has been a guest since she was a puppy. She has lots of friends to play with, I know she’s receiving excellent care, and she comes home after her bath fluffy and beautiful. The staff members are friendly, competent, truly love animals, and are always happy to see her.</Review>

I came in for grooming services. I got a major shedder on my hands. These people were great and covered all of my concerns for my dog. They put the cutest bandana ever on my baby. My dog is soft again, smells great, and is super happy. Big round of applause to these guys because there’s no way I could do it on my own!</text>

I have had the pleasure of being a Bed and Biscuits customer for six years. They have taken excellent care of three of my dogs and two cats. Their daycare, training, grooming, and boarding services are excellent. They care about their clients and their community and will love your fur babies as much as you do.<//text>

<text>We recently bought a new puppy and Bed and Biscuits has done a great job with grooming. They listen and try to meet client requests. The other thing I appreciate is they don’t keep your dog caged all day. Our dog has been done in less than 2 hours for each appointment.< /text>< pics>

<Date>1611027572061</Date><review>The facility is nice, the staff friendly and knowledgeable, and Jess did a great job on my labradoodle. The only change I’d make is the length of the hair on his paws, but I should’ve  communicated better. The cost was a little higher than I’ve paid elsewhere but it’s worth it and I like supporting our local businesses. They gave me a welcome packet- I thought that was a nice touch.

My dog was panicked when I dropped him off but when I picked him up he looked happy and like he had a great time. I plan to take him back.</review><rating>5< /rating></record></dataset><record>

I have had both my Great Dane puppies trained here and spend days for daycare, and while I love it because I know my pups are in great hands there, my pups absolutely love the socialization with other dogs. They get so excited each time we park out front. And you can tell everyone who works there cares about all their clients and their owners.<//review>

I loved this place.  It was the first time taking my dog to them when I called the women I spoke to was super nice and helpful.  When I dropped off my dog was super nervous and didn’t want to walk in. When I picked her she didn’t even want to leave. They did such a great job at grooming her. I will definitely be taking my dog back to them<//Text>

Form the first moment I called, they where attentive to answer all my question and made me feel they cared about my puppy. In your first visit they will treat your pet as if he where one more if the family by always calling him by his name and being attentive to his preferences, needs, and behavior. Go take a tour, know the facilities. I will gladly take Benjamin (puppy) back.</text>

<review>I was so impressed with every aspect of Bed and Biscuits. This was my first time boarding my pup. From the moment I arrived the staff were attentive, expecting my dog, and knew important information from his paperwork. It was also clear that the staff had interacted with my dog, knew his personality, and even commented on his distinctive markings. Every boarder I use in the future will be living up to their standard!<//review>< pics>

This was our first time boarding our dog (7 month old Shepherd). He was nervous when we arrived, but once we were checked in, and I handed him over to the staff - he was at ease. Everyone here clearly loves dogs/pets. You can feel it when walking in.
I especially enjoyed the report card I received - with photos.
We will definitely be back</text>

<UserId.>112981108786854453118< /UserId.><text>I can share a positive professional experience. My dog Rosco a 2.5 year old French Mastiff 110lbs, it’s the first time we’ve had the need to board.
Bed and Biscuits staff were upbeat and quick to answer any concerns, very clear answers not industry speak. Store front was well stocked and had a wide variety of toys.
Drop off day went extremely well and Rosco was clueless to the length of stay but they handled everything. Including 2, 30 minute Play time and 3 restroom visits. We received a “report card” mid stay and was very happy for the communication. Even happier to hear he was doing great.
Pick up day was better than expected, counter staff was eager remembered my name and described a fantastic experience for Rosco.
Go online make an account, and call for availability for boarding or grooming needs.
Thank everyone involved for making a return visit our choice in the future.</text>< Rating>

<Resp>None< /Resp><text>My brother & his German Shepard were evacuated from recent fires in So Cal. My house rental policy is strictly “no dogs”, so doggo unable to bunk in with me and brother. Dog was made welcome at Bed & Biscuits, where she was so happy! She had play dates with other dogs her size. Brother was notified when her stool was runny, so switched to a different food which corrected  issue. We were encouraged to take her out for walks & play in adjacent fenced yard. She was wagging tail & was happy to return to staff & kennel upon return from walks. It was a HUGE relief to know she was in loving hands during a very stressful time. ALL staff were compassionate & empathetic around anxiety of fire evacuation & dog care. Cannot commend highly enough, especially staff person Trenton. Thanks again for running such a terrific operation & employing fantastic staff!<//text></record>

<text>Bed & Biscuits are so amazing!!! They took in my two dogs during the CZU Fire evacuations. We live in Boulder Creek, and were displaced for 12 days. They didn't charge us anything and allowed our two dogs to stay in the same kennel. We are so incredibly grateful for the support during such a stressful time. Our dogs seemed well taken care of and happy when they came home. I highly recommend them for any dog care services. And I will certainly use them again, and pay whatever costs, if I am in need of boarding services in the future. Thank you B&B!!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Awesome place for my pup. Clean facility with friendly staff who remember the dogs name after only one visit. We’ve been doing daycare here since my girl was 12 weeks old. She loves it.  I feel very comfortable leaving her. Also, they have a great set of services; grooming, boarding, training etc. Lovely location, plenty of room to roam, and easy access to freeway. ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️<//review>

<Text>It's like summer camp for dogs. We usually see a guy there who's known our dog longer than we have, from before we adopted him. They're always happy to see each other. I don't really know about how the pricing compares. I think you can count on your dog doing well here, so I guess that makes it a good value.</Text>< pictures>

<review>Today I did about 5 hours drop in doggie daycare for my 2.5 yo GSD. She was happy to be back at bed& biscuits.  I was given insightful reports on who she played with and how. The crew was fantastic. My GSD is now one tired out girl. I recommend this service and will try to use it more often.< /review></record></dataset><record>

We all love this place, and it’s because of the people! We’ve done training, boarding, and daycare. Even my old grumpy-pants terrier loves going, as does my mischevious kelpie. The staff is outstanding-you can trust that your furry children are getting high-quality care, and the staff is always kind and responsive to us humans, too.<//text>

My first experience with putting cats into a 'kitty hotel'. Everyone was quite friendly and accommodating on drop-off and pick-up. Cats were happy and healthy when we picked them up.
Areas of improvement - (1) When I called to check up on the cats, the person who I spoke to seemed put-off? by my questions about if my cats were ok. That felt odd. (2) There is no mention of price on their website, nor was it mentioned when I dropped off my cats. You can imagine my shock when I picked up my cats and had a bill of over $1400. (3) For that kind of high cost, daily updates on how my cats are, plus some photos, would make me feel better about the high cost for their services. (4) Suggest a contract with pricing and expectations upon dropping off pets, so there's no big surprises at the end.
To end on a good note - I discovered they were taking in evacuation animals that owners didn't have the ability to keep with them -- FOR NO COST. I thought that was very cool <3</text>

<text>I did daycare for my mini poodle who is a rescue and 10+ years.  She is very attached to me, and I was apprehensive about leaving her for the day.  When I picked her up, she was happy, tail wagging and they reported she did very well.  I feel comfortable that Bed and Biscuits is our go to for boarding🐾<//text>< pics>

This review is for grooming services (I also highly recommend them for a dog boarding!). I had my dogs bathed and groomed today, and they did an amazing job!  Perfect cuts.  My old groomer used a number 10 to shave, and when I got to bed and biscuits they recommended a number 7 in order to keep their skin safe from sun. This was great information and the cut looks excellent!< /Review>

<Review>Thank goodness for them.  My dog really needed a haircut during the quarantine  I called and they had an appointment that day. My little girl came home looking beautiful and smelling great.
So thankful! My dog has crazy fur and It can’t go many months or she would look like Chewbacca!
Awesome job and everyone is so friendly.
Please call them let’s help support our small businesses.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Name>Pam Lopez< /Name><UserId.>108664929859126424681<//UserId.>< resp>

<text>It was easy to make the appointment and drop her off. They definitely honored all social distancing criteria. We dropped Kona off smoothly and quickly. And when we picked her up she was ready. Everyone at Bed and Biscuits were so happy to help us and were great at explaining the whole process to us.

My pup has epilepsy and is very sensitive. This is the only place in town I trust. I have been to a few other groomers but I’ve consistently been disappointed with his hair style or being cut too short/close to his skin. ALL of the groomers at BnB are professional and Gilbert always comes out of his haircut looking very good and happy. I have recommended this place before and will continue to do so.<//review>

<review>First time using this service was excellent! Positive and professional staff! Clean, plenty of play area, staff engaged with pets! The staff was quick to  socialise our 14 week old pup with well mannered and playful other dogs as she arrived in the outdoor play area! Made us so happy to leave our pup in such good hands!! Thank BnB!  As we left the staff said they were just finishing up her report card and would email it. My daughter and I were extremely pleased all the way around! We'll be back soon!< /review>< pictures>

Highly recommend Bed &Biscuits -due to our house being on the market  we had to board our two dogs for several weeks - they were very happy every time we came to visit and happily went back to their kennels rather than going home with us - B&B gave us updates on how they were doing and provided excellent love and care to our big dogs. Will definitely board here again< /Text>

I always feel comfortable and confident that my baby will be well taken care of when I drop him off. I guess it also helps that he leads me into the front door at drop off 🥰  Normally a bandanna is placed on my boy after grooming but not this time. Hopefully next time 🤞🏼<//review>

Bed ans Biscuits came highly recommended by a friend's colleague, and they did not disappoint! We got home a couple hours ago and my pups havs been happily sleeping away their good time! Something that is really important for me is finding a place that can accommodate individual play time since my pups love each other, but aren't good with other dogs. I was also thrilled to get a "report card" after their full day there letting me know how my pups were doing. I didn't know they did that, so that was definitely a welcomed bonus because it showed me that they're really paying attention to the pups in their care. Also, with this having been the first time they stayed there, it just provided some extra peace of mind. Everyone was wonderful, friendly, and helpful, and I could tell that my pups enjoyed their stay. They'll definitely be staying at Bed and Biscuits next time we're in town!<//Review>

You can have the highest level of trust in the employees treating your dog like their own! Stop in and take your pet there for grooming or boarding. They also are top quality in care with boarding as well. So grateful they are in our county! Nicest employees ever! You won’t regret taking your pet there!! 👍🐶<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

B&B are the BEST!  They’re all so so nice and love every dog that walks in the door.  My pup is always happier when I pick him up and sleeps like a log.  Their training has been so good for us and their “doggie dash” training continuation program helps us stay keep up the training with our little maniac.  LOVE THESE GUYS</review>

<text>I took my dog there for a full service wash, dry, trim, and tooth brushing.  My dog looked outstanding!  When I arrived home, I decided to look in his ears and his ears had not been cleaned or removed of hair.  I called and asked the person on the other end if I had to specify everything I wanted done.  He said it normally is done and he didn’t know why it wasn’t done.  He said to come back anytime and they’d do it at no charge.  The person was very nice about it.  I loved how my dog looked and it only took 3 hours!  I’ll be going back.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<Review>Our dog loves this place so much that he doesn’t bother saying goodbye when we bring him in. The people here know our boy well and give him lots of attention! I would recommend Bed and Biscuits to anyone who wants to feel secure about leaving their pet while they are out of town. The day care is great too.</Review></record>

There are not enough words for me to describe how much I love this place. My dog, Karl, is so happy here, having done both daycare and boarding. The staff are kind and get to know the animals well. They are his extended family. We have run into employees away from B&B, and Karl is always excited to see them. I've boarded dogs elsewhere, and have brought them home distressed and anxious. Karl comes home from B&B happy to see us and tired, but not distressed. On daycare days, he is excited to arrive. I couldn't ask for more in caring for my buddy.< /Text>

We have 2 Aussies & we've used both Crystal (scissors) & Jessica (clippers) for grooming.  Both groomers have been fantastic, done a superb job, had a great personality and really love animals.  We get the works: bath, trim, nails, ears, and teeth.  We go about once every 2 months and have been going for over 2 years? now.  We can tell our dogs love going because they actually pull us to the office and whine until the groomer comes out!  Our dogs look great, feel silky, and smell so clean and they KNOW they look good.< /Review>

Bed & Biscuits is great!  My little dog, Finny has been boarded there a couple times.  He has the best fun playing outside with all the other little dogs.  And, is tucked in safe and sound at night.  He comes home happy and exhausted.  I know that he has been well cared for and love that someone is onsite 24/7.  Staff is professional and it shows that they love animals.  Thank you.</Review>

<review>Runaway with us RV was looking for a groomer for our dog, Jimi Hendrix during the current pandemic. We finally found Groomingdales/Bed and Biscuits in Santa Cruz. They were an hour away but so worth it!! We didn't have to wait very long for an appointment. Jimi looks amazing and the staff listened to what we wanted. They have reasonable pricing and are taking cautious measures to protect humans and their pets.<//review></record>

<Text>Amazing staff and doggy care. I came in from out of town on a whim and they watched my pup so we could enjoy some of the attractions.  I will definitely use them again when in the area. Cannot thank them enough for their help. I found them by calling a few vets in the area and they all referred me to Bed & Biscuits.< /Text><Time>1573405703784< /Time>< user_name>

I adopted the dog about 3weeks ago, can’t find groomers in Carmel, CA. because “shelter in place”
I feel very lucky to  find bed & biscuits at Santa Cruz, they’re absolutely god send, they take care of my new dog & explain every step of what they’re doing( ie: this is my first dog )

They’re very caring & professional, I’ll bring him to bed & biscuits for grooming again.<//review>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Amazing facility that has every option available. Doggie day care for short visits, overnight boarding, and pet grooming! Our dogs love the daycare because of the activities and special treats! They will even send pictures mid visit so you can see how they are doing! The boarding is reasonable and they will feed them according to your wishes, we bring the food and they feed them exactly as we instruct. All the grooming services we've employeed have been carried out perfectly with great care. We love this place and so do our dogs!< /review>< pictures>

The folks at Bed And Biscuits do such a great job with our dog. The very professional, kind, and gentle with our little pooch. We’ve been using them as groomers now for many years and I can’t think of going any other place.<//Review>

<Review>We bring our dog here for boarding when we take vacations and recently a few times when we are going to need an empty house for certain reasons. My dog will come back and we think she is dead but she isn't, she i just exhausted. When I pull up to the driveway, our dog goes nuts cause she knows where we are. We have no plans on looking anywhere else to take our dog for long stays because this place is awesome and conveniently located right in the middle of town willing to take our large dog at a fair price.

Their grooming is also great as well, our dog is an Alaskan Malamute with a ton of fun and she comes back looking great.</Review>< resp>

I love the personal attention the puppies get. My puppy was very happy. He likes to play. He got plenty of this. I was glad to hear that the evualation was on target. It is reassuring to me to find a place I'm comfortable leaving Atticus.<//text>

In our most dire time.   Bed and Biscuits came to our rescue.   A house fire took our home and one of family dogs and left us seeking for lodging.   Bed and Biscuits in our time of grief gave comfort by taking in our other dog while we searched for a place for us to once again be together under one roof.

The world would be a better place if there were more places like Bed and Biscuits.   Love,  kindness and compassion that's what you will find there.</Text>

<Review>I bring my 2 labradoodles here for grooming, either just a bath, nail trim, and teeth brushing or a full grooming with haircut! My dogs have been anxious at other groomers, but here, the groomers are so experienced and have such a positive attitude, that when I pick up my dogs, they always look great and happy!
They offer a variety of doggie daycare that gives everyone many choices for their pups!
The staff are all friendly, respectful, professional, and treat the pups and their humans with kindness and patience!
They are all awesome!< /Review><Rating>5< /Rating><Time>1573061173614<//Time><user_id>107875754236746594677< /user_id>< response>

<Gmap_id>0x808e3ffd57d20e7d:0x21ce80cd5f91f30d<//Gmap_id><Text>Ohhh man, where do I start! Be careful, you may just fall in love. I am a severe helicopter mom of a mini Aussie who is my little everything. I was looking for something like day care but with training, (considering my boy is still a puppy and LOVES mental stimulation- more than I am able to give him). Bed and Biscuits has been such a blessing for us both.

Their puppy training class was exactly the type of structure Cooper needed. I was weary at first because there’s not much explanation of where your dog is kept/or specifics about his day to day activities. Trust the process!!

Cooper went from a puppy I had no idea how to handle, to a well mannered, happy as can be, amazing dog. Kat (their trainer) is INCREDIBLE (and deserves a raise)!! Go to the parent/trainer conferences!! Kat taught me how to keep the training going at home, and I now have a successful routine and means of communication with my dog that ACTUALLY works.

We now do doggy dash in between training programs, and Cooper learns so much every day, he comes home exhausted, and listens better that I could ever get him to on my own. Yes, it’s expensive. Yes, it’s 100% worth it. If you’re like me, and work way too much but also need to have an amazing doggie in your life, CHOOSE BED AND BISCUITS. You won’t be disappointed, I promise, I’m hard to impress.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Name>Halley Rebecca<//Name><Resp>None< /Resp>< Time>

<review>I've got a very shy, nervous and quirky Shiba Inu who didn't do "well" at other places in the area. But we tried B&B one time and it all changed. B&B accepts my dog the way he is. They treat the dogs as individuals. Fantastic, friendly and caring staff. B&B's facilities are clean and they are a great value. Now, it's all tail wags when we show up. We won't be changing from B&B anytime soon.< /review><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x808e3ffd57d20e7d:0x21ce80cd5f91f30d</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>My dogs love it! They love attention from people more than other dogs, so it's great that there's staff just to play with the dogs. My little one loves the special gourmet treats they get when they stay at Bed & Biscuits - no cancer causing milkbones around!
I also think their training programs are fun, effective, and easy for owners to complete. My little "bee on a string" became much easier to control and command, even when there's lot of other dogs around to play with.
I highly recommend their boarding, grooming, and training services.<//review>< date>

My family has been bringing our pets to Bed & Biscuits for over 13 years now and still do. Bed and Biscuits is  our pets home away from home. Each staff member has treated us with kindness and knowledge. We are very grateful to have this business here to take care of our family members. Thank you for keeping our pets happy and well groomed 😉< /review>

Great place. Kind caring staff, report cards on request, shop with adorable pet supplies. They will take your dog for day or night for doggy daycare and/or will do grooming. Not a lot of space to park is my only complaint.</review>

<text>Not only are the people that work at Bed & Biscuits sweet & accommodating, but they take excellent care of my dogs. I've used them for grooming, daycare, and boarding and they are the best. I wouldn't trust any other facility in Santa Cruz. My little terrier is always tuckered out when he gets home from Bed & Biscuits (not an easy feat!), and I know he gets lots of attention while he's there. I love their YouTube channel, which shows the doggies at play. Their prices are reasonable and their care is excellent. I highly recommend them.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x808e3ffd57d20e7d:0x21ce80cd5f91f30d< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>Our puppy has been coming here for grooming since he was 4 months old.  The groomers have taken him slowly, slowly into this world which will be so necessary for him when his adult coat grows in.  He likes to come in and likes his groomer.  We started daycare once a week for socialization and that is a thrill for him.

Update:  Rufus is 2 now and comes here once or twice a week for dog socialization with the little dog gang.  He loves it and as soon as we turn on Chanticleer he starts whining to hurry up, wagging his tail. He comes home exhausted and happy and sleeps like a log.    I feel so lucky to have a place like this that he loves where I know he is looked after.  Six stars.<//text><time>1442380276439</time><username>Carolyn Reynolds<//username>< pictures>

My Giant Schnauzer Poodle mix has been groomed at Bed and Biscuits for a couple of years.  The last 3-4 visits have shown a steady decline of service quality.  Management needs to implement a serious overhaul of customer service and quality control.  Make sure you get to look over your dog before they ask you to pay or add a tip.</review>

I was hospitalized thru emergency with double pneumonia and my only family is my 2 dogs who were with me upon admission. The hospital arranged for my babies to be boarded here and I am so grateful to them for the excellent care given my fur babies I was afraid they would have been taken to the shelter at at risk of losing them but thanks to bed and biscuits and the care given my digs when I was reaped 4 weeks later they happily made reuniting my pak a dream come true.< /review>

From the receptionist who worked them in, to the checkout the staff could not have been nicer. Jessica did a great job grooming both of them. No nicks or bare spots.
I would highly recommend their grooming service.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics></record>

The wonderful staff, especially Brianna, boarded my dogs and cats for free for two weeks when I became homeless due to the Bear Fire that destroyed my house.

Brianna kept me up-to-date on my cats' welfare.

The Phone Scheduler even went to the extent of calling me before I got there to tell me that my dogs needed one more set of shots and she even gave  me directions to a local pet store for a clinic that takes walk-ins.  I recommend this place if you really care for your dogs. Thanks everyone there and look forward to having you guys groom and watch my Pups.</Review>< rating>

{'time': 1418247032548, 'text': 'Thank you for your feedback and your vote of confidence regarding our facility and care. We’re sorry to hear that there might have been a misunderstanding regarding our new rates. We understand that each pet is unique, so instead of a one-size-fits-all approach to pet care, we actually lowered our base-lodging rates and created discounted activity packages to choose from, all so pet parents can select the level and type of activity that suits their pet best!\nWhether its group play with other dogs, one-on-one playtimes with a staff member, cuddle sessions, gourmet treats, bedtime tuck-ins and much more, you will now be able to select exactly what your pet does while staying with us.\nWe understand that finding just the right pet care for your four-legged family member is an important decision. While we do hope you’ll allow us the privilege of taking care of your pet, we would like to provide you with 5 questions to consider when comparing a pet sitter to the superior, loving care and 24 hour supervision pets receive at Bed & Biscuits Groomingdales.\n1.\tWill your pet receive continuous monitoring, loving care and attention all day, every day, while you’re away?\n2.\tDo the caregivers have professional training by experts in pet wellness, animal behavior and handling?\n3.\tIs the environment clean, sanitary, free of anything that could be harmful to pets, with secure fencing to keep pets safe?\n4.\tIf there will be other dogs around, will they be properly vaccinated, as well as separated based on size and temperament?\n5.\tWill your pet be lonely and bored while you are away or will they be interacting with a full staff of well-trained pet lovers?\nWe also appreciate your feedback regarding our hours. We strive to be open when during times that benefit our clients the most and are considering adjusting our hours of operation accordingly. Please watch for updates on that.\nWe would love the opportunity to discuss this with you further and answer any questions you may have. We invite you to call us at (831) 475-1580 and speak directly with our General Manager, Meghan. We wish you and your pet the very best and hope to see you soon.'}</resp>

<review>We love the care our dog gets at Bed and Biscuits, but the new rates make it much less affordable than boarding with private dog sitters.  They don't have regular Sunday pick-up times, so you have to pay for a full night, even if you pick up your dog during their 3pm - 5pm times.  However, the place is clean, they are careful to match the dogs with other dogs of similar energy levels, and they truly care for the dogs in their charge.  I would give them 5 stars, but for the price.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>My dogs and cat have been going to Bed and Biscuits for ten years.  Before we moved out of the Santa Cruz area a few years ago we boarded our pets there when we traveled and they always came back to us with big smiles and well exercised.  Now, when we return to the area, it is great to know we have a reliable place for them to go while we visit friends and family.  Whether there for the day or overnight, our pets are relaxed and content.  We have a senior dog and a puppy, they both enjoy playing with other dogs and I'm glad they can have supervised play time at Bed and Biscuits.  Also, I have called to check on them during their visits and the friendly staff is always able to give me a swift report on what they've been up to and how they are behaving.  I highly recommend Bed and Biscuits. I would never board my pets anywhere else in the Santa Cruz area.<//Text>< pictures>

<text>I take my pups here for daycare, boarding and grooming! The staff is always so friendly and my pups go crazy when they come through the front gate! Can't say enough positive things about bed and biscuits. My high energy cattle dog and pitbull come home exhausted so I know they are getting lots of play and love! My cattle dog had some hot spots and their esthetician healed all of them with some wonderful all natural sprays. I recommend this place to all my friends and peers! Definitely worth every penny!!<//text></record>

I have two dogs, one large and one small.  They sleep together at night but the little one gets to run around with the other little dogs during the day while my big one gets play time with big dogs.  Recent policy changes now have me paying fairly steep fees for playtime that used to be included in the boarding costs.  Also the Sunday pick up hours are unfair to the customer.  Because they are open only from 3 - 5pm on Sunday, you are charged for a full day. That being said, my dogs always love going to Bed and Biscuits and return home happy and tired.<//Text>

Bed and Biscuits is an excellent venue for dogs of all persuasions. My name is Fudgeboy and I was more than happy to visit Laurie and her associates at this luxury facility. The food was top notch and I met dogs who will remain my friends for a long time. I'm an elderly dog now, ten years old, and I know what I'm talking about. I'm looking forward to my next visit to Bed and Biscuits.< /text>

<review>I picked my dogs up this morning after an 8 day board. While gone on business, I did not receive 1 update on my dogs. I did, however, leave a message 4 days into the board with no response.
After picking my dogs up and paying a whopping $1,106.65, I noticed Lilly, our 3 yr old female maltipoo, had some yellowish stuff (later determined to be feces) smeared on her face and right paw and was acting very timid. I did not drop her off for her board covered in poop so I would expect her to be returned in similar fashion.
While gone, Bed and Biscuits took it upon themselves to get my dog Gizmo, a 7 yr old male rescued Poodle/Chihuahua mix butt glands popped or massaged. Cost An additional $141.00 Not even sure what they did. I cannot read the vets note and the lady at the front desk said she didn't know what happened because she wasn't working that day and it wasnt written it the computer. That's the answer I got. Forget asking her supervisor. I bit my tongue in frustration. Then I noticed Lilly's face/snout covered in fecal matter as I left. I will NEVER bring my dog to be boarded here again. And I SERIOUSLY recommend you do the same if you regard your pets as more then just animals. ****NOTE: THEY NEVER EVEN CONTACTED ME TO INFORM ME THEY WERE BRINGING MY DOG TO THE VET AND GIZMO IS STILL RUBBING HIS BUTT ON THE FLOOR!!!!!****
I have pictures but it doesn't give me an option to load them. I will post my review everywhere possible so hopefully other sites offer the photo option. I immediately called and left a message. No call back yet and it's been 2 hours.< /review><Name>Jerry Midland< /Name>< time>

<Response>{'time': 1524890675949, 'text': "Hi Nate I'm happy we got to check in with you after you left this review. After speaking with the staff today, I want you to know that we all love your dogs. They are super adorable. I'm sorry that it feels as though so many things went wrong. First off, we are really sorry you didn't get a call back after leaving a message. That is not something that usually happens. The office staff member that called you regarding the veterinarian visit should have tried another number on file. We have talked and both agreed that should have been done. Often dogs can develop loose stools from being in a new environment. Diarrhea usually should clear within 24 hours. If we have dog with diarrhea longer than 24 hours we will take them to the Veterinarian to be examined. The Vet had noticed the glands were full during the exam. We wanted to take the Veterinarian's advice and have the glands expressed. The Veterinarian recommended canned ID food for intestinal problems to help clear up the diarrhea. We switched to that food and Gizmo liked it. We think that canned food is the culprit for the yucky beard. After checking in with the morning staff they were surprised about the yellow feces. We always have a couple of staff members in the small dog area. If a dog poops, we clean it up. Preventing us and the dogs from stepping in it. And unfortunately, without us noticing right away a dog or a staff member can step in poop too. We always try our best to notice when a dog does step in poop. If it does happen we will bring the dog to our grooming section to be cleaned up. I don't mean to come up with all of these excuses, I just want you to know we see were we messed up. The information we are giving is true and we do care for your dogs. I hope you ses that in our response to you today. Trent said you seem very kind. You were just very concerned about your pups, as we were too. Thank you and I look forward to meeting you Wednesday.

<rating>1<//rating><text>We enquired about boarding our dog here and asked about the facilities. We were told our dog would have been kept in his caged area all day with 'occasional' 15 minute potty breaks. No access to the doggy daycare area as it would be "overcrowded and it would be a safety issue". "If you want your dog to be let out to play, you have to pay an extra 16 dollars for 30 minutes of playtime". Advice: keeping a dog in a cage all day with 'occasional' 15 minute potty breaks, would certainly not be 'fun' for our dog and our dog would be very upset. I would never subject my dog to this kind of treatment.< /text><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1509840455780, 'text': 'Hi Simon\nIt sounds like we could of done a better job explaining the care we give each dog. We have large indoor with outdoor access accommodations for each dog. Each dog will have 3 elimination walks per day. The exercise time is customizable for each dog. Every dog needs a different amount of exercise due to age and the breed. We have a low overnight rate so that each person can choose the best exercise package for their dog. We do not have a specific daycare area. We have a quarter acre play yard for the big dogs. Play times consist of fun play and receiving love from the staff. Dogs are matched up with about 10 other dogs their size and temperament. The time spent playing and exercising is the parents choice and we feel it should be. We want to keep every dog healthy and happy during their stay. I would love to have you take a tour and see our accommodations and fun activities we offer each dog.'}</response><Gmap_id>0x808e3ffd57d20e7d:0x21ce80cd5f91f30d< /Gmap_id></record>

We board our cat and dog (Aussie) at Bed and Biscuits whenever we go out of town.

My cat comes home spoiled and my Aussie comes home wonderfully groomed and worn out.

The fact that my dog is excited to go tells me that he is well treated while there and happy with the amount of play time. Yes, they are a little expensive but you know what they say, you get what you pay for.< /text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>NOT WORTH THE MONEY FOR BOARDING!

I am NOT an overprotective dog owner, or a hard person to please...BUT...I paid over 300 dollars to board my little dog for a week, and was extremely disappointed at what that 300 dollars got me.

It was our 1st time using B&B and I was not informed of how any of it worked and if I could access any photo or video of my dog during the week or VIP treatment/rooms (which I saw online) I asked about alIergy meds being given and treats being given (bone) when he is in a crate at least once during the week. I also brought a small bed and blanket so he could have the smell of home, but was told he couldn't have either do to the fact that they will lose it. (understandable with the high volume of dogs coming and going.)

It was a TAG and GO process. IN quick - OUT quick.

On my arrival I was not told about the weeks events, or how anything went. Even after asking the Front Desk Gal, she pawned me off on the next person who then didn't give me any information besides "fine". Upon getting home I looked through his bag to find pieces of paper stapled to almost everything, with the days of the week on them. Nothing was marked on anything! NO meds were given, and not one of his treats (bones) had been opened. Word to the wise in any customer service business, if you are going to use those you should fill them out. He has had all the proper shots up to date, and has seemed "off" since we brought him home. He just hasn't seemed like the dog we dropped off at B&B.

I read reviews, the place was new seemed pretty nice, but was beyond disappointed with the overall service. They seem to be better at grooming then boarding, and I will tell people to go else where for boarding. Bummer.</Review>< pics>

Unfortunately; giving a dog a haircut is a specific trade and our other grooming staff is not certified to do so. We would be more than happy to compensate you for your time wasted just call us and speak to Meghan. This isn't usually a problem for us and I don't think you would have that problem again. We are sorry for wasting your time and hope to hear from you soon."}</resp>

Wonderful experience, staff friendly and professional. Kitties home after three night stay. Called to check on during stay, got immediate updates to alleviate any worries. Meows came home to a bath, ran around, ate and curled up in laps napping within three hours of pick up.<//Text>

{'time': 1487989861604, 'text': 'Hi Christina I checked in with my staff this morning after your rating was posted to ask if they remember speaking to you and find out if there was a problem. The woman that answered the phone when you called said you were interested in daycare. After logging into your account she found that 2 vaccines were due and explained you would have to get those records to us in order to have your dog in our daycare. We have to leave that process up to owners because most veterinary hospitals will not release information to us without your consent. Usually people have their vet fax us the current vaccine records or they have a copy of the records and bring them in with them upon drop off.\nWe are sorry for the inconvenience but each dogs safety is our #1 priority. All dogs need to have current vaccines in order to come for boarding, training, or daycare. Thank you-Bed and Biscuits'}</Resp>

I have been going to Dr. T for approx 4 years now.  She has always listened to my concerns before suggesting which treatment(s) would be my best option.  Dr. T is kind and gentle and explains your treatment fully so you have a total understanding of what to expect.  The staff are amazing and always ready to help out and answer your questions.  I trust Dr. T and her staff and would highly recommend that you pay her a visit!<//review>

I would give them 10 stars if I could! Dr. Gloria and her staff are  amazing. I recently came here for Botox for the first time and I absolutely love my results! Dr. Gloria was very thorough about the process and comforted me the entire time. I also received lip fillers from her and love how they turned out! They are exactly what I was looking for. Kristara is also so sweet and comforting. I have already booked my next appointment to help the visibility of a surgical scar that I have.  I highly recommend Dr. Gloria and her staff!!</Text>

I tried multiple places for my lip injections and botox before finding Dr. T and I will never go anywhere else again! She did EXACTLY what I wanted and I always leave feeling beautiful. The entire staff is professional and and caring. Not to mention that when I had a family matter and missed an appointment, they checked in with me a few days later to make sure I was okay. Not a "lets get you booked" check in, but a genuine how are you check in! The mix of quality, care, professionalism, and communication gets Dr. T and her team a 5+ star rating from me!

Dr. Tumbaga is the most professional  MD I ever met. She has  wonderful  staff.
Wonderful team. I love all my treatments  she has done on me. I wouldn't ever go to another physician for my aesthetic treatments. I also recommend her tinted sunscreen and skincare! Thank you Dr.T for taking very good care of me!<//Review>

I needed some work dome last minute and I had my 2 toddlers with me. Not only were they able to get me an appt that suited the time frame I needed, but the staff watched my kids in the waiting room while I was seen. The doctor was also realistic in explaining my expectations and I liked how she performed the procedure. I will 100% be back.< /review>

I can’t say enough good things about the folks here.  Always going out of their way to be informative and helpful.  Monica is great.  She’s thorough and has a huge knowledge base of their product and their results.  Dr Gloria is a true expert on Botox and all its different varieties.  She consults each patient to develop an individual plan of care.  My results have been amazing!  Looking forward to continuing my care with some laser treatment in the fall to reduce some sun damage.  And the price is actually lower than I have ever paid for Botox.  I can’t recommend them enough!  You will be thrilled with their range of services, quality of care, and cost of treatments.< /Review>

Dr.Tumbaga sets realistic expectations. I went to a medspa and they only gave me 8 units on my forehead and 8 units to my frownlines. I didn't get a response and I was upset. She explained to me that I probably needed more units. After my treatment I was very happy! She was right, I needed more units! I was wrong to want less units and she knew exactly why I didn't get the results I wanted. Thank You Dr.Tumbaga!<//text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>She did my botox and it was fine and worth it hundreds I paid. no worries. However when she did my RF microneedling, I was not numbed properly and the pain was excruciating and intolerable.  The treatment was very rushed unfortunately.  Shortly after seeing her, I went to another clinic my friend recommended and bought the same treatment for almost half the price and the doctor there was extremely kind and patient and actually cared about my safety, so he numbed my face for 90 minutes prior to starting treatment and the treatment was not rushed. He took his time, over an hour. He was very caring and worked diligently and with patience monitoring my skin for any reactions as he did the treatment. A much better and kinder doctor. Unfortunately I am very unhappy and unsatisfied with this spa. I don't feel they cared about my safety or were patient with me. They charged me $850 for one treatment. I bought 3 of the same treatment for $1500 at the other clinic. Most importantly,  the other clinic cared about my safety and were very patient with me unlike this spa. I am very happy with the results from the other clinic not this spa however. It is very disappointing and i truly feel cheated.< /text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<Review>Dr. Tumbaga practice and her staff are built around delivering excellent customer service and providing treatments that will satisfy you.
When a business becomes successful, they seem to neglect the details and importance to building strong relationships with their customer.
That is not the case at Wellness Diagnostics.
Some critical factors in good customer service are speedy, and attentive responses. Every staff member, including the doctor goes out of their way to respond fast.

I would also commend Dr. Tumbaga because of the incredible interactions she builds with her customers. I have seen many customers positively responding to her exceptional level of professionalism and the respect she delivers.

Personalizing any clients experience goes a long way and creates loyalty. From remembering a life impacting experience to the simple act of offering water as you run late for your appointment.

I would highly recommend her services. Give her one change and you will not think twice about using a different doctor to help you look your best.
Dr. Tumbaga is caring, smart, sincere, interesting, and a great professional.</Review>< Resp>

I recently moved to the area and called a ton of places to figure out where I wanted to continue seeking the skin care I needed. When calling the office the receptionist was extremely friendly and I was able to consult with Dr. Tumbaga right away regarding my needs. My first visit was a perfect client experience. Warm friendly greetings and the Office Manager Joe, was extremely helpful in explaining additional services they provide and how they benefit health and wellness. The assistants Monica, Pamela, and Krista are all amazing. Great chair-side manner and so personable. Overall a wonderful experience and might I add Dr. Tumbaga has the lightest hand I’ve experienced with Botox! Highly recommend this place, and happy to have found my new home.< /Text>

You guys! Dr Tumbaga is the ultimate in care! Not only is she and her staff incredibly professional, (and just beautiful people, inside and out), they are also super friendly and totally make you feel at home and comfortable.

Dr. Tumbaga is highly gifted and provides you with very detailed information to educate you (not hype up unrealistic expectations) during your procedure. I am totally happy with my treatment and so proud to show off my results!< /Text>

I have received several treatments at Wellness Diagnostics. Dr. Tumbaga is an artist with the eye for aesthetics. She's a great doctor that doesn't only care about how you look on the outside but works on how I feel on the inside. From botox & filler to IV nutrition & gut cleanses to CBD Salve & Skin Care Products, I've received the best care from Dr. Tumbaga. She addressed my concerns and I'm impressed by the results I've received since coming to the clinic in January. Very happy with the services provided and would highly recommend Dr. Tumbaga for her expertise.<//Text>

<rating>1< /rating><text>Went here to get botox due to forehead lines, was talked into getting Juveaux, which I was told was the same as botox.  Spent over $200, got 26 units injected, within three weeks it was already wearing off.  I went into to see doctor, told her of this, and IN the waiting room, with another patient sitting there, didnt take me back into her office, I asked "Don't you think the fact that I can easily move my eyebrows might be an indicator that the Juveaux didn't work?!"  Dr. Tumbaga told me it was just because I was OLD that I still had lines!  I couldn't believe it.   They also talked me into spending nearly $100 on a "neck cream" that's worth about  $10, did absolutely NOTHING!  Now I understand why they make you sign all the legal paperwork agreeing NOT to sue them, nor to expect any specific type of result!
Find another person to do your injectables is my advice, there are LOTS of them out there, and most of them aren't as rude,  and incompetent as this one either.  If I operated my business the way this one operates, I wouldn't BE in business for long.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1577810145358, 'text': "Linda, due to HIPAA guidelines, I'm unable to discuss your experience any further online.

I was referred to this office by a friend who did major research on the doctor before going in herself. I have seen Dr. Tumbaga several times for varies treatments. Her office staff is always very friendly and helpful as well as knowledgeable about various treatments and procedures. Dr. Tumbaga is VERY particular and takes her time with each procedure wanting to make sure you are pleased with the outcome. She is extremely professional and cares enough to do follow ups on procedures other doctors I have seen never did before. The pricing for services is UNBEATABLE and they are constantly running specials and or promotions to get you the best bang for your buck. I have referred friends to Dr. Tumbaga and highly recommend Wellness Diagnostics and Medispa!<//review>

I have  been with Dr. Tumbaga for over 2 years and I feel like family.  I started with just wanting my skin to look better, which it now does thanks to Dr. Tumbaga, and have also had botox, lip injections, the O shot, and several other treatments.  I am told I look 10 years younger!  Whoo hoo!  Dr. Tumbaga, Joe, and her staff are amazing!  Everyone makes you feel so comfortable, no high sales pitches, and are genuinely concerned about your well being not only physically but also mentally.  I started out with Dr. T after separating from my husband of 20 years and just needed to do something for myself.  I have never had anything done before and was super nervous but Dr. T listened to my concerns about my skin and also listened to what I was going through in life.  She really gets to know all about you, not just rush you in and out.  Dr. T and her staff have been there when I went through my separation and recently the passing away of my mother as I cried my eyes out in her waiting room.  They have all been so supportive.  Dr. T is always adding new procedures and treatments and I love her "events" which always have special pricing deals.  I would HIGHLY recommend Wellness Diagnostics & Medispa!  You won't be disappointed!</Review>

Dr. Tumbaga goes above and beyond to address your concerns in a caring and pleasant manner. I’ve had several procedures done at Wellness Diagnostics and Joe, the Office Manager and the entire staff have been very helpful and accomodating. Dr. Tumbaga is always available to answer any questions I have. Although I have to drive a long distance to get to Wellness Diagnostics, it’s worth it to me. I highly recommend Dr. Gloria Tumbaga and Wellness Diagnostics.< /text>

Caring, friendly, honest, and great follow up. Dr. Tumbaga really takes the time to listen to what you are telling her, and will give you her honest professional opinion without trying to sell unnecessary services. It’s refreshing to have an expert in aesthetic medicine who truly cares about her patients and personally follows up with them regularly. I highly recommend Dr. Tumbaga and Wellness Diagnostics and Medispa.</review>

I must admit, I was nervous seeing Dr.Tumbaga for my erectile dysfunction. I researched the Pshot and saw that she performed it. I went in for a consulation and her staff was so nice, especially Joe. He made me feel very comfortable and I felt I could open up to him about my issue. Dr.Tumbaga was also very professional and knowledgeable. She gave me realistic goals and informed me of all the treatment options. After the consultation I felt good about it and had my first treatment. There wasn't any pain and I was surprised how quick it was! A few weeks later I noticed a huge difference! My girlfriend did too! Overall I am so happy with my Pshot results and looking forward to another one! Worth every penny. Thank you Dr.Tumbaga! I highly recommend her! Guys, go see her and get your Pshot!</text>

<Review>I came to see Dr Gloria Tumbaga because of issues with love handles. I am a physically active male but could not get rid of my love handles no matter how hard I tried. She recommended Trusculpt 3D which is a non surgical device to get rid of my love handles. I wasn’t ready for surgery and this was a perfect option. After just 2 sessions I can already see an improvement and I am looking forward to more improvement. Thank you<//Review><Date>1529779548670<//Date><Pics>None< /Pics>< name>

My consultation with Dr. Tumbaga went extremely well. She actually greeted me as I entered her office. She spent an inordinate amount of time discussing my “problem areas” and discussed various methods she believed would benefit me. Most importantly, I have confidence in her. After reviewing her background I am so impressed with Dr. Tumbaga, not only for her level of education, but for the hardships she has endured and sheer dedication to achieve her goals. I believe her commitment to succeed translates into her level of patient care. I look forward to a mutually satisfying relationship combined with successful results with Dr.Tumbaga.< /review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>There is no way to review a church based on traditional parameters since it's mostly related to your faith and belief and your longing for that particular place of worship. That's why we have places where people go more than others for worship and getting their wishes fulfilled. I will try and talk about some peripheral things about this place though.

Plenty of parking space since it also has a school. I love the coffee and the donuts here. The sermons from the parish priest is very relatable and informal. Very prompt in their publications. So many charity activities going on every week which in turn gives you lots of opportunities to contribute to the society and lastly, awesome people. I always attend the 8 am mass and love going to this place. May God bless you!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<rating>5</rating><review>A beautiful church in a great friendly community. The mass is always beautiful and homilies are relevant.

Very holy church dedicated to St. Jude, the patron saint of all that's impossible. There is an outdoor grotto for prayers. They also have a Catholic school.

There's ample parking on the sides and back of the church. Clean bathrooms at the back. A small mark across the street for kids and adults alike.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

I volunteered at the Conejo Compassion Coalition information booth during St
Jude's annual Fall Festival. The CCC was started and meets at St. Patrick's Episcopal Church, but we share interests with our Catholic friends and they were kind enough to give us some booth space.</text>

My sister, parents and I have been attending mass at this parish for the past 20 years. Whether you have lived in Conejo Valley and been a parishioner here for 20+ years or you have recently moved here from out of state and just started attending mass here, St. Jude is very warm and welcoming to all who enter its doors. The pastor, Fr. Jim Stehly, is one of the kindest and most compassionate people who goes above and beyond to make all feel at home when they are here. I am very proud to be involved in their Loaves and Fishes Ministry which helps the less fortunate in both LA and Ventura Counties. Getting involved in one of the ministries here is a great way to meet great people.</review>

<review>I love St.Judes! The masses are fun with lots of singing, and Father Jim does a fantastic job. The programs of CCD (the family program) and Confimation are fenomenal, as i am currentyl a Confirmation student and it really allows you to dig deep and get closer to God. The whole Church community at St.Judes as so great and friendly, with many events and classes for all ages. If you are looking for a church in the area, St.Judes is definetly where you want to be!< /review>< Pictures>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>From this station, you have 4 directions: taking Washington Blvd side to Culver City, taking Venice Blvd side to go to the Venice Beach, take the bus to Beverly Hills or stay in the train to go to the Santa Monica Beach. From here you can see the Hollywood sign and skyscrapers in downtown LA. There are many stores around within walking distance.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80c2b981166ee409:0xeeb28f85aa47fea1< /GmapID></record>

I like this station a lot. Clean. Brightly lit. Large parking lot. I only use this station for Rams and Lakers game so I don't know what it is like to purely commute. But for what I use it for it is perfect. Don't have to deal with parking near the stadium.<//review>

I used to park here often and take the train downtown.  Centrally located in Downtown Culver City.  This station also offers a parking lot, which during off-peak hours usually/almost always has spots available.  A great station on a great Metro line!</text>

Love taking the Expo Line, this has truly opened up new opportunities for the City of Los Angeles.  It is very reasonable to travel $1.75/each way and there is a discount for seniors!  No stress, no traffic and so I am excited to discover new destinations such as the Natural History Museum in Culver City.

We love taking the Expo to Santa Monica and in 42 minutes we are there.  The first weekend was very busy, however coming home was really quick.< /Review>

Hooray for the train! Light rail is working its way around LA and the Expo line is a really useful addition that goes from Culver City to Downtown. Trains are pretty clean and as most of the line is above ground, you aren't without phone signal during your trip, which is always a plus.<//Text>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>This is not really a review of the service, because I cannot get on the #!#&^!#*& Expo line.  I tried.  I really did.  But I can't.  Why not?  Because the imbeciles who designed the system forgot to provide a way for most of us to actually board the trains here in Santa Monica.

First, there is virtually no parking for the average SM resident.  Most spots are reserved for monthly users.  The long and short of it is that there is about 1 spot for every 5000 SM residents, after you eliminate the monthly rider reserved spots.

But that doesn't really matter, because I can't get a TAP card, which grants you access to the rail system, because the attempt to purchase one hits the brick wall of: THE SYSTEM WILL NOT FUNCTION and there is nobody to talk to or contact who can deal with he problem that THE SYSTEM WILL NOT FUNCTION.  So, I cannot buy on line the TAP card I need to ride the rail line.  NICE WORK.  The imbeciles who designed this must have all been fired by airlines and the US Government for incompetence and stupidity, then suffered strokes of debilitating effect, only after which they qualified to help design the rails system.

Thanks for nothing.  Back to my car.  Good luck to you who seek to take the 2.5 hr trip from Pasadena to SM -- you could walk it in three hours.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Culver City Station is really none common because from the right we can see the Fox Home Entertainment Building that was the main filming location of the movie "Die Hard 1", and from the left we can see the Sony Pictures Entertainment Building that was a filming location for the movie "Last Action Hero"; moreover, in 2014, I saw many times this funny man begged money in front of the station.<//text>

<rating>4< /rating><review>This is the midpoint to the light rail train known as the exposition line. It goes from 7th and Metro in downtown los Angeles to Santa Monica. This used to be the final stop during phase one. They now are building huge complex that'll be completed in 2022.  Now the line goes to 4th and Colorado (phase two) which is three blocks from the SM Pier. It's used by tourists and smart locals that refuse to drive on the 10 freeway.<//review>< Pictures>

<time>1444502100020</time><rating>4</rating><Text>As the current end point for western end of the Expo line, the Culver City station is a nice "flag ship" for what a big station can be like on the light rail. There's a lot  of surface parking for a non-event day. It feels safe. And it's pretty easy for newcomers to figure out what's going on.

That being said, there is not even close to enough parking spots in this lot to support major events. When there is a USC football game, this parking lot gets absurdly full. There isn't enough convenient street parking nearby (and it sucks for the nearby residents), so people who are planning to take the train downtown are often left circling and praying that a spot opens up.

Especially as the line expands to Santa Monica and usage grows over the next year, this really needs to be more than just a surface level lot. While the station is pretty nice, it was really poor planning on the city's part to not make this a multi-level parking structure. Every time that a first-time rider gets turned away at the parking lot is another person who will never try to ride metro again.<//Text>< pics>

It Is About Time!

Los Angeles used to have their very own Train System called the Los Angeles Railway (also known as Yellow Cars, LARy, and later Los Angeles Transit Lines) was a system of streetcars that operated in central Los Angeles, California, and the immediate surrounding neighborhoods between 1901 and 1963. Except for two short, 2 ft 6 in (762 mm) narrow gauge[1][2] funicular railways named Angels Flight and Court Flight, it operated on 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm) narrow gauge tracks. The company carried many more passengers than the Pacific Electric Railway's 'Red Cars' which served a larger area of Los Angeles. The two companies shared some dual gauge 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm) / 4 ft 8 1⁄2 in (1,435 mm) standard gauge track along Hawthorne Boulevard, on Main Street and on 4th Street.

Today, they have the Expo Line which now goes from downtown los angeles towards santa monica beach and long beach and hollywood up to north hollywood, stretching its' way to pasadena all the way to azusa and citrus college.

In addition, there are other train lines to and the system just keeps on getting better and better.

Currently, they are working on the crenshaw line which will take you by train close to the airport and then you just get a shuttle bus from there.

They are also working on the purple line which will take you to beverly hills, century city and ucla.

Amazing!

I think this system will serve its' people well!

In my photos, you will see me getting on the train to go from santa monica back towards los angeles.

I hope you will board their expo line train the next time that you are trying to get somewhere like I did.

Thank you.

Sincerely yours,

Howard  Paul Shore
Metro Expo Line Customer And Rider

<time>1626995919169</time><Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I think the best storage unit is one you don't think of often. I never worried about the safety of my stuff, or the cleanliness of the facility, or if I'd be able to access my things, or really anything. It was reasonably priced, accessible, clean, and the staff was amazing. And as I was moving my stuff out for a cross-country move, a staff member showed up like a storage wizard to close out my account. No complaints, only compliments. 10/10.<//Text>< pictures>

<review>I met with Serena today and she was wonderful!  She was super knowledgeable and helped me select a space that fit both my size and budget needs. The facility is clean and modern and feels very secure. I also met with Barry who was friendly and welcoming. I’m looking forward to enjoying the breathing room of having less clutter in my home by utilizing this storage space!< /review><time>1553292555393<//time><user_id>111172291284938003372<//user_id></record>

<review>I recently rented a unit and as someone who likes to research different options, I have to say, this place is fantastic. Roger and Serena were incredibly kind and helpful. They recently added new (outdoor/drive up access) units. These are brand new and extremely easy to load, with plenty of space. I initially used spare foot to book this but ended up calling and letting them know the special that I saw online. They honored it, hooked it up even more in fact and the entire process took a few minutes. If you need storage, don’t let the yellow stars fool you, this place is legit.< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>Roger is half the reason I choose this storage. It's good to know there is a responsible adult at this location if I have any questions or issues. Roger was helpful showing me space and getting me set up. This location is pleasant, has natural light, room to park a truck, and is very clean.< /Text>< userid>

<Text>This place is great! There are nice people always ready to help especially the manager Roger😁 This place has plenty of storage, Great security, and they always have fair prices and great deals. I would recommend this Storage place to everyone in L.A. especially for the simple fact that most places are really unfair with prices.<//Text>< Pictures>

This is a sad but uber happy review. I have had my storage at this location since 2008! I have been a tenant for 11 yrs! Do you know how long that is. I have been here through 3 name changes and company take overs. I met Roger a long time ago. I had storage because I fell on hard times and wanted to keep my belongings in the area as a mental picture that I would be back. Well it happened and I got my own condo Monday. I closed my storage Thursday and got a chance to say goodbye to Roger. I was excited about my new place and finally clearing out my storage but sad because this guy has been apart of my life for so long. He had my back as the protector of my belongings and he was so gracious in allowing me to remain there. I will never forget when fires rocked our area last year and I was so worried about my belongings because I could not reach Roger for almost 5 days. When I finally talked  to him I was relieved and he said "We are ok!" He said we meaning my belongings and him. That meant we were in this together! I hate late fees but when I was late Roger was always understanding! Now I still had to pay! But he was so helpful, encouraging and solid. What a great guy and it seems like I am losing a family member. Thank you Roger for holding down the fort and looking out for me all these years. What a great guy and I am blessed to have been in communication with a guy like that!< /Text>

Very cool place! During college break I needed storage for a few things and these guys were great.
The manager Roger and the entire staff found me the perfect unit. Highly recommend this company!</Text>

I work remotely for an IT company and we were in DESPERATE need of a storage unit for some equipment. Roger, the manager, was unbelievably helpful, professional, and went above and beyond helping me. If I could give more stars, I would in a heart beat!!</Review>

I am writing a review because my experience with the people is STELLAR. They do everything they can to help. Stuff was too heavy for me to get out of my area and someone helped me move it. They say "yes, let's see what we can do" to every request. Amazing.    I was at Public Storage before and they say NO to everything, don't care about clients, just the worst experiences ever.  I will never go to Public Storage again. Believe it or not, I enjoy paying Life Storage each month. Thank you.< /review>

<Name>Murielle Dreamwear</Name><Review>This place is really bright, cheery, clean and safe and the staff is friendly and helpful. The hours are convenient, the place is well secured and the staff called me right away the one time I forgot to lock my storage space. They patrol the hallways regularly to check that all is well. I am sorry I had to move away because my new space doesn't even come close to this. Also, this place is very conveniently located right off the freeway with ample parking, and they provide dollies that are freely available, unlike some other storage spaces that lock them and require you to go to the office and give them your driver's license to use them! I would give it 10 stars if I could. Thank you Serena and Roger :-)< /Review><UserId.>111155600700889594017< /UserId.><time>1495558387215</time>< Response>

<Review>This review is overdue but, i just wanted to let people know about the pleasant experience i had with Serena and everyone at the Calabasas Life Storage facility.  We needed a small place at the last minute for our sons dorm items he wasn't lugging back to NJ and this was perfect.  The place is clean, the office closes at 6 but you can access your unit until 9pm which is great.  No contracts, just pay monthly as you need it.  I would definitley recommend Life Storage!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80c29e1346697777:0xcf355c70e8d17fe3<//gmapID></record>

<Text>One thing people may not realize about running a mundane storage facility errand, is that it may in fact be the case that the storage locker hasn't been opened in years. Likely, the items inside hold some value, if not at least some sentimental value. Opening an old locker may mean an emotional ride that you hadn't prepared for. Today, I decided to clear out my tiny locker filled with banker boxes holding old photos : office items and college papers. There was zero anticipation of any kind of an emotional reaction whatsoever and that's why I was caught off guard to feel the feelings I was feeling; reminiscing and also realizing that time goes by so quickly these days! LIFE goes by!

The kindness of the assistant manager, Serena Canion, truly helped me feel comfortable and calm about clearing out my locker. Not only had I lost my key by this point, but I had also not had enough room in my car to empty everything out. She had broken off my lock, lent me a new lock to close the locker up, and also offered -- most importantly-- her warmth. Aside from her personal touch of kindness, she was extremely well informed about the brand and it's inner workings. I was very impressed with her knowledge, pride of working for Life Storage, and also her very organized and thorough paperwork.. I felt safe with her.

Finding this type of welcome at an institutional storage locker facility does not go unrecognized. In a completely indirect way, Serena's confidence, care, warmth, and service held me together and reminded me that good people matter and need to be valued. This is a public review to recognize her humanity and also to give Life Storage a high 5 with their color selection and upbeat feel with their new branding strategy! It worked for me!

Thanks Life Storage for hiring just that perfect individual to host the clients who may be using the facilities for a variety of life reasons. I'd love to see her promoted.< /Text>< Pictures>

BUT BETWEEN TECH, THE SO CALLED "LEAN DEPT" WHERE THEY BASICALLY STOLE $109.00 WITH THE EXCUSE CALIFORNIA LAW ALLOWS US TOO! & GETTING HOLD OF CORPORATE IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE, JAMIE & ALBERTO AT LIEN ARE PUNKS SHE LEFT ME A SWEET SWEET MESSAGE "hi this is jamie & we understand you had a lien placed on your account I'm really sorry heres my number you can call but u aint gett'n your money back we don't care you've been with us 4 years had 5 months with tech problems on online payments, & your lock was cut off"! hehe it's just one of those things, WE UNDERSTAND YOUR IN PHILIPPINES & UKRAINE & CAN'T USE AUTO PAY BECAUSE U HAVE 2 HAVE EVERY POSSIBLE PENNY IN YOUR BANK ACCOUNTS WHILE OVERSEAS & THAT FAR FROM HOME but hehhe we DON'T CARE! U KNOW WHY ((CALIFORNIA LAW ALLOWS US TOO hehehe") with that stupid giggly childish voice SHE IS A NASTY WOMAN! PS. YOU HAVE A 10 GRACE PERIOD 40 DAYS IT'S OFFICIALLY LATE & YOU AY A LATE FEE, I USUALLY CAN ONLY PAY ON RETURN HOME WHICH IS ABOUT 30-40 DAYS IT WAS LESS THAN 45 DAYS ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION, CUT HE LOCK, ADDED A LIEN, & CHARGED THE XTRA $109.00. uNCLE BOBS HAD A GRACE PERIOD OF 15 DAYS & 60 DAYS LATE FOR ANY LEIN! I'VE ALSO HEARD HUNDREDS OF FOLKS HAVE BEEN RIPPED OFF ON THE AUTO PAY & COMPUTER log in SYSTEM WITH EXTRA FEES & LATE FEES BECAUSE OF TECH PROBLEMS ((AS THEY KNOW!)) THEY HAD A HORRIBLE TIME GETTING THAT SYSTEM SET UP~! ANOTHER REASON I DON'T LIKE 'auto pay' ITS A HIGH RISK SYSTEM TO HACKERS! PS..so dont use a debit card folks ever! always use a credit card!<//Review>< Pics>

<review>Came because we have so much junk at home and needed to find a storage unit, we were greeted by Desiree, she was very welcoming and helpful. This is my second time in 5 years getting a storage unit with public storage. Awesome customer service and always kept clean. They offer insurance which is always good to have. Highly recommend and ask for Desiree she makes the moving experience less stressful. They also offer packing supplies. 🙂< /review>< rating>

Desiree was VERY helpful and saved me a lot of money. On the day that I was supposed to pay for my unit, I wanted to close it out. I WAS just going to bite the bullet and pay for the month, but Desiree was able to help me out and clear it up for me. I really appreciate the work she did. Thanks for storing my stuff while I was in the process of moving. See ya next time.</Text>

<text>July 23rd 2020 I stopped at storage to drop a few things off. I arrived there at 5:53, but I knew I'd be able to drop everything off before closing at 6pm.  The rep that manages the office was so incredibly rude. She YELLED...was about 5 inches from my ear...screaming to stop walking, to wait at the bottom of the stairs. She locked me in the building....twice. this person was so unprofessional...so AGGRESSIVE, SO RUDE --im a customer!   I pay $120 for this rent every month. If i can drop a few things off before closing, what's the problem? Find respectful  to manage your offices. People, customers, deserve to be treated with RESPECT.</text>< Pictures>

Desiree, The site Manager was wonderful. Her knowledge of Public Storage and it's workings made my experience stress free. She explained every option available to me, which made me feel safe about storing my personal belongings. Her smile was infectious and by the end of the day I had the feeling that I was leaving my property with family that would watch it and take care of it as if it was there own. The Facility was really clean and all materials that I needed to make my move easier were displayed in such a way as y make them appealing although they were just boxed and rolls of tape.
I would for sure suggest to all my friends to use Public Storage whenever they find need for</Text>

Today I had the opportunity to remedy a misunderstanding I had with PS. I arrived ready for a disagreement. To my personal and professional surprise I was met with a welcoming smile, complete understanding and a sincere desire to resolve my issue. The property on first street in Pomona California is fortunate to have a kind and compassionate rep. Like Desiree. I wish I had more employees like her. Thank you.</Text>

<review>Desiree is always helpful when I come to my storage unit. Never a question left unanswered and during a time like now (Covid-19 Pandemic) its hard for us as renters sure, but we never really look at how difficult it must be to be in her shoes to keep hundreds of renters content,  and she does a great job of doing just that. Desiree for President!< /review><time>1590103550814< /time>< Rating>

Located right in Downtown Pomona next to Western University. Terri was extremely helpful. She was the reason we chose this location. My wife and I were looking to store some items after a death in the family and not only did Terri help us find the right unit, she was sensitive and empathetic to our situation.<//Text>

<Text>Stopped by yesterday to check some prices on units and was greeted with a smile. Lauren was extremely friendly and was very knowledgeable and helped me find the perfect unit. Not only did she find me the perfect space but she also explained and showed how to store my stuff to maximize my space and saved me money! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that is looking for storage and ask for Lauren, she definitely knows her stuff! Thanks again Lauren, you are awesome!< /Text><rate>5<//rate>< name>

Today I went in to rent a unit and Joshua was extremely helpful. He helped me save money by selecting the right unit, by asking if I’ll be storing any furniture or mainly boxes. He also made sure I knew how to properly secure my unit.< /text>

I went in Monday on July 8 the man that was there is a huge blessing. I didn't get to say thank you. But I'm very thankful and grateful for his help. Me and my 3 kids appreciate everything you did for us.  I do recommend this place for anyone who is searching for a storage. Once again may God bless you and thank you for your help!!</review>

Very friendly, helpful and clean. It is a smaller public storage but it was definitely still nice. Lauren in particular was super friendly and helpful. She does a really good job and if we were still in the area we would still have a unit there because of her. These five stars are mostly for Lauren!</review>

<Review>Tarry was super sweet and really helpful. She explained everything step by step knowing that we didn't really speak English that well. Let me refraise that the person who was with me getting the storage under her name didn't speak English  fluently. So even though I could of translate everything she still went out her way to help us. That u don't see allot now n days lol. She also was really specific with everything and very friendly I would love to work by her side I think we will make a great team.

I went there to go get a storage unit. There was one worker and a room full of customers. She handled it well and got to everyone as soon as posible. She helped me get the unit I needed and answered all my questions. Great service but management needs to hire more employees, one is not enough to cover all the customers. Carrol was a great help!< /Text>

First and only storage location I've had to deal with, heard many rumors about how storage facilities handle things and was very skeptical going to one. Going in expecting the worst, came out with a complete fulfillment of contentment of success that I was able to have found such a great storage complex. The women named Lauren was not only completely professionalt through our move in process she was able to make such a hard task seam so less stressful to finalize. I Will Definitely refer all of the people i know who are looking for a place to store their possession.</Review>

I really loved the fact Lauren helped me out and got me the space I needed for my things I need to store. She was very helpful and sweet. Very fast and reliable. I would recommend her to anyone in need of assistance at the last minute like I did.< /Text>

They didn’t have what we were looking for but Joshua helped us find another public storage nearby and still keep our promotion. He was really informative with all pricing and fees. He was super great and gave us amazing customer service. Would highly recommend this public storage<//text>

I have been a long time customer here at the Pomona facility and have had many managers here. Lauren has been the BEST by far! She is very professional, courtious and cares very much for her customers. If you're new to storage and want great customer service then come to public storage in Pomona.</Text>

Christopher has made my experience truly wonderful. From the beginning he was helpful from finding the perfect size and made the entire process easier than I expected. He makes himself available at all times and is always willing to help with any arising situation. Christopher is a great asset fpr Public Storage.  I definitely recommend this location to anyone that needs storage space.< /text>

Don't waste your time unless you don't mind on taking a chance your storage unit doesn't get broken into. And I learned that not all the areas have security videos. My unit got broken into twice lost over $ 8,000.00 worth of items.< /Review>

Lauren helped my wife and I pick out the perfect sized storage unit. She was extremely helpful and answered all our questions. She went above and beyond getting to know us and was extremely friendly. This is the kind of service you look for in an employee. Thank you, Lauren!</Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>This was by far the best experience I've had regarding storing my belongings! I have tried many other storage companies and quite honestly, never felt this safe. I was hesitant about the location only because of the surrounding areas, however, once I stepped into the office, I felt a weight lifted off my shoulders. The office was clean ,well maintained and it didn't hurt that you have a very sweet and helpful young lady by the name of Marisol who put my mind at ease with her professionalism and the knowledge to answer all my questions without hesitation. I recently vacated and can say that I am leaving a happy customer! the property was always clean, well lit and I always felt secure. I have recommended this location to many of my friends and family. Thanks again!<//Review>< Pics>

Beware of this location, my 1st floor unit was broken into. I received a call saying your units latch was knocked off by accident & that everything looked 'fine' when when the worker looked inside. But when we went there our latch/lock was all screwed up & hard to open which means someone had all the time to work on breaking in. We saw that 4 TV's, PlayStation, printer, 3 large bags of my clothes were stolen among other things. They have people living on the facility. Conveniently NO CAMERAS on the aisle where my things were stolen. This is either an inside job or the people living in their units. Front office workers encourage new customers to give positive reviews on the website but when I went there on the day I found out what was stolen there were two customers upset that there things were stolen as well with no footage. It took 4 hours for Pomona PD to show up for us to get a report & for him to say 'this happens here all the time'. Had I known this place was this poorly secured I would not have gone here OR I would have purchased better insurance because they sure don't care about nothing but your monthly payment. You're supposed to do your part but they are horrible at doing their part. They should let you know from your 1st day there to purchase the highest insurance because things are stolen from there a lot and that people live in their units. Call back was too slow from the district manager Rick Jansen and now I'm over talking to him. I will pursue further action to recover what was stolen from this essentially open to the public to steal your things...Public Storage.< /Review>

<text>Hello To Whom It Concerns;

I have been ere at this storage site for over a year. I have had the best treatment from a facility The manager Samantha, and assistant John have been super in their approch to what they do. Now recently my unit had been broke into. The staff went out of there way to make certain that things that were left your in fact safe and protected. They looked like it was their own unit that was dealt with. I give them high marks for friendliness and helping hand.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80c32df9f7129849:0x71732baa1d71885f<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Marisol was exceptional with regards to customer service, and attention to detail.. With her proffesionalism, she was able to get us a unit identified, and all the paperwork completed within 20 minutes... I would recommend this facility to anybody from the college student, to the shop owner.. thanks Marisol!!!< /review>

Lauren is by far the most polite and respectful towards others unlike another new employee which she was very rude & had an attitude. I hate to see niecy go & transfer on me to Redlands ☹️ but is long as there's people like you and or Lori it would be a pleasant experience every time 🙂< /review>

When I came in to rent my unit with my boys the employee Ashlyn was there to help us out. I needed a storage quick and she was very helpful, quick and friendly making the process easy...since I've been here the property manager Niecy has been just as helpful and friendly every time I come. She keeps the property clean and is always helpful and smiling with everyone I see her talk to.< /Text>

<Review>Stephanie was freaking amazing! I was on my way over and got stuck in really bad traffic and was not going to make it before they closed  and had to unload a uhaul truck and have it returned that night so I wouldnt get charged the late fee and she said" No problem, I will probably catch some heat from my boss but I will be there for you". That is outstanding customer service! She went above and beyond to make things work for me, at a time when everything in my life was completely falling apart. My stress levels had been through the roof that entire month and she had been so helpful. Thank you Stephanie!<//Review>< pics>

Staff is great but security is minimal. 17 units broken into and insurance company they use makes it near impossible to get compensated for stolen items.< /text>

<review>Came to rent a storage with my mom. When we came in Ashlyn helped us to get the right unit to dit our stuff. The unit is close to the front and more than enough space to go thru our stuff. The property manager Niecy is always there also and is very helpful, and friendly when we come in to us and everyone. The property is always clean too.< /review>< user_id>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>Niecy is the most respectful, understanding manager there could ever be. She's attentive & can always be found. I love how she greets me everytime w/a smile, knows & calls me by my first name, & also answers all of my millions of questions w/clarity.
The Pomona Public Storage site is my second home, & the fact that she keeps it very clean is welcoming. (I just wish they'd fix/open the restroom back up already, LOL!)
The prices are good, the other ppl are courteous as well, & the location ulis excellent-right next to downtown, yet it's never too crowded at the same time.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

Their service is top notch and the atmosphere is very friendly and relaxed. You get a separate room for massage and sound isolation is great - you don’t hear any other noises.
Had massage with Ginger and omg she was amazing! I felt like a new person after just 1 hour session.< /Review>

<review>I got my massage from massage therapist Tommy here at Elements Massage. He was fabulous and I highly recommend him to other people! He listened to my needs, targeted specific areas that needed more attention, very thorough, and also the pressure level was just right. I felt so relaxed and rejuvenated afterwards.<//review>< pictures>

The massage was relaxing and the space was clean, staff was very friendly! I called about an hour ahead and they were able to squeeze me in at the last minute. I will definitely be back again soo!<//review>< pictures>

My therapist, Lauren, was very good. The place is very clean and relaxing. The front desk staff are very helpful and pleasant. All in all it's a great place. I would like to have more female therapists available on the weekends though.</text>

Very nice and quiet in the spa this evening. My biggest complaint when I come usually is the lack of etiquette from the guests so the quietness is appreciated. Note: guests, it's not a party place.
Shiv did a fabulous job on my Radiance facial. Thanks!< /review>

Shiv is a master. The reception area is peaceful and welcoming. Reception staff are efficient and welcoming. Ryan is equally talented and thorough, and has literally cured my aching back!</Review>

<review>Been a monthly subscriber here for several years. They have a great variety of therapists and good availability throughout the day.

The staff here are very friendly and I the place is very clean. Their website also makes it easy to book appointments.<//review><rate>4</rate>< UserId.>

Offers a variety of masseuses, easy to book online, they track all monthly fees AND credits, and has a great level of service. It's not a fancy spa but if you just need a great massage, this is it. They make it really easy when life is stressful enough as it is!< /Text>

Here’s the issue with this place - 1. you need to book far in advance. Don’t ever expect to come in same day or even within a few days. 2. The 60 minute massage is actually more like a 45 minute, 90 is more like a 75.  Evidently- management only requires them to give the massage for this amount of time. So if you have nothing to talk about to fill up the 15 minutes...they will just end early. It’s annoying and you end up feeling cheated. 3.  Some therapists are great, some are awful.  In general - you want to find one you like and stick with them or you will end up feeling frustrated.<//Review>

Sleek facility,  very good therapist,  reasonable time windows for scheduling.  I had a problem when I needed to  cancel on short notice due to illness    There is a sign posted in the waiting room requesting that clients  reschedule if fever or signs of flu are present which I attempted to do. I was shocked to be told that I would be charged a $75.00 fee for this. I am a member and had paid for 3 massages the previous month. Then,  somehow the salon booked me for an appointment for the following week. It appeared in my calendar 1 hour prior to the scheduled time. Will I be charged for this "missed visit"? Shady practices to repeatedly charge my credit card.  I won't be continuing my membership after the 3 month contract expires.<//Review>

Great friendly service (over the phone for order and in person for pickup). The pizza itself was very tasty! We ordered a medium pepperoni with extra sauce and it was some of the best pizza I've ever had!<//Review>

Such a great place! Love their delicious sourdough crusts! Their cheese is exquisite, so stunningly strong tasting. The sauce is fresh and zesty. All in all, Pizza Plus is, to be blunt, the chef's kiss of pizza.<//review>

Pizza Plus is an absolute Placerville landmark! This is hands down the best pizza in town. All pizzas are hand tossed and baked the old way: on stones. Thanks Chris and crew!<//Review>

This pizza was amazing! The crust is usually the "make it or break it" part of a pizza for me, and this pizza crust was perfect. I wish I lived closer, because it would be my go to place.< /Review>

< review>
I happen to stop in on this place from a day trip with kids playing in the Tahoe snow all day. Kids are always picky eaters to start with. We saw a couple of pizza joints along the road heading up earlier in the day and we felt it wasn’t going to be a problem feeding the troops on the way back. Sadly I was mistaken and found that the pizza places were closed??? It was a bit disappointing and we decided to wait till Elk Grove to stop off along the way back to home. As a last ditch effort we looked for pizza eateries along hwy 50 as we’re coming down the road. The name Pizza Plus stood out being that we love the Ripon Pizza Plus. We decided to make a pitstop and check it out. I honestly didn’t read reviews or really how far off the main hwy they were located at being that it looked like it wasn’t too far. I ordered a Lg.pepperoni, Sm. Hawaiian, and Med.Rockin Combo for 9 people. The gang devoured all the pies down to one last small slice. The crust was so crispy and had the all so desirable fresh bread from the oven smell and taste. Just the right amount of fresh toppings that made for a perfect pizza pie. Everyone raved at how delicious the pizza was, and how it was worth the small detour. We have definitely found a new go to stop when next we’re nearby by. The staff was very friendly which also made for an enjoyable experience. Looking forward to enjoying some pizza indoors at this place to try out other goodies on their menu. Great Job Placerville Pizza Plus.<//review>

Best pizza in town! Always great customer service & pro-tip; if you order a large 1-2 topping pizza and use the $4 off coupon usually found in the Windfall newspaper (free) it ends up being the same price as a small!</review>

<Review>Pizza plus has been our number one pizza place for the past 20 years! My parents have been taking us here since we were young kids and it is still my favorite place! The pizza always tastes the same! Even after so many years! There os something about the cheese that makes every pizza amazing! Always friendly and fast and ALWAYS delicious!< /Review>< Pics>

Pizza was good but they had no idea what a Margherita pizza was. No fresh basil. I'd go back and try again though< /Review>

<Review>Tl;Dr Polite employees and good dining area, *very* generous toppings, but small beer selection and their specialty pizzas aren't worth the price.

Pepperoni pizza was infinitely better than chicken artichoke. Chicken was waaaay over seasoned (more pepper than chicken!) and artichoke hearts were left whole on the pizza. When I worked at a pizza place we pulled them apart. Maybe I'm nit-picking. But tons of toppings, good ranch and good crust! I'd go back for a 1 or 2 topping pizza but I don't think I'd get a specialty pizza there again.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Love their pizza. Lived by the one in Sutter Creek. The only difference was tidyness. Placerville should check that one out and pick up a few cues on neatness. It just seemed a bit dirty.</Text>

Maybe the best pizza in Placerville and El Dorado County. Great homemade crust that has the right amount of crunch, the right amount of soft, and a hint of sweet. Perfect sauces and fresh toppings. Reminds me of Romas in Sacramento, which happens to be one of the best pizzas in Sac.< /review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Text>Mmmm! This pizza is sooo good! My fiance and I have been trying various pizza places in Pasadena to find our favorite and I think we've finally found our go-to spot.

We ordered two personal 12" pizzas - the pear & gorgonzola and the standard pizza - via their online ordering system, Clover, and picked them up to eat at home. Both were amazingly delicious! I first tried the standard pizza which has pepperoni and mozzarella on it. The pepperoni had the perfect crisp to them (you know, when the edges curl up a bit and forms a cup) and the mozzarella was so melty good. I followed that with a slice of the pear & gorgonzola which had the perfect combination of sweet and salty to it. The pears and cheese tasted super fresh, and the crust was great as well.

It only took about 30 minutes from the time I ordered until it was ready - this was around 6pm on a Wednesday evening. I'm so happy I found this place and will definitely be coming back to try their other pizzas!</Text><date>1602134604295</date>< user_id>

Visiting from the bay area. This place is absolutely delicious,  with all the right vibes.. ordered potato empanadas with green chili salsa, fried artichoke and zucchini pitas, and eggplant parmesan with spaghetti.  I highly recommend , the outside seating is great for just opening back up dining. Now for dessert!!! Amazing!!!!<//text>

Tardino bros is a very welcome addition to Pasadena. It's a family-owned business and that comes through in every bite. LA has a huge number of highbrow Italian restaurants, but Tardino Bros stands apart by making what tastes like the best version of home-cooked dishes, always warm and comforting. Side note -- their cannoli and, perhaps surprisingly, potato empanadas are amazing -- do not skip.<//Text>

<text>This place was off the hook y'all. I wouldn't shut up about it. $45 family meal came with spaghetti and meatballs a large pizza cheese bread and salad with cookies and a soda to share. We all ate and had tons of food to spare. Your missing out if you don't go here and the staff and owner were so friendly and welcoming. A definite return customer for life!</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Excellent food, great service and just steps away from the downtown Azusa Gold Line Station. My favorites from them are the grilled chicken pesto panini and the meat lasagna. They are now even open for breakfast on Sunday mornings.  The omlet I had from them this morning was delicious.<//review>

For a gluten-free person myself, I was torn...IN A GOOD WAY! So many incredible options for pasta. ACTUAL GLUTEN-FREE LASAGNA?! I can't believe it! A place that serves gluten-free lasagna actually made by hand instead of from a microwave!! And chicken wings are around too. Tardino Bros. is a real feast.</Text>

Visiting from Colorado and tripped across Tardino Brothers. Family owned and operated. Terrific pizza and terrific people. Fun inviting atmosphere and good prices. I had their special, the Death Star and it was amazing. Check them out, you won’t regret it.</Review>

We walked to the this place from the Costco about a mile away while we waited for a tire to be repaired.  LOVED the veggie panini and the margherita pizza!  But it was the service that really makes this place special.  Our waitress was so kind and welcoming.  We felt like family.  When we finished our meal, the sun had gone down and we needed to walk back to our car.  When the owner found out how far we had to walk in the dark he offered to give us a ride!!! So kind! Thank you for your amazing generosity following a delicious meal</Text>

The food is FANTASTIC. The portions are very generous. And the service is top notch.

I had the weekly special - Italian Style Tacos, and I was blown away. Best tacos I've ever had with a  unique fusion twist.

Our servers were attentive and helpful, bringing our drinks, salads, and entrees promptly. They were incredibly courteous and conversational, and offered to bring fresh drinks whenever our were getting low.

Would highly recommend to anyone living in or visiting Azusa.<//review>

<rate>5</rate><Review>Went while visiting my sister, I ordered a meatball sub and said no cheese and the manager (nice lady) came out to see if that was right and I told them that I'm allergic. After they found out they offered to make me a pasta dish with olive oil and garlic to avoid cross contamination (they worked with my food allergies better than a vast majority of other restaurants that I have been to). And honestly it was the best pasta I have ever had. I still think about it four months later because it was that good and now is the pasta dish to beat. It was the perfect amount of garlic and the pasta was cooked beautifully... I could go on about it but I won't. Oh my family also liked their food and their drinks were good too. Would recommend.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Incredible cooking some of the best Italian I've ever had it's like I walked into my cousin's kitchen. Really good environment. You gotta have some ice cream for dessert.
If you like Italian  you have to try this place.</Text>

Nice store, have some really good dishes, very friendly manager lady... great Italian icecream.
Lose a star for hours, they don't open Sundays or Mondays.. but they are very family oriented and that's why... but a bit of a negative for a city center restaurant< /review>

Absolutely Great Place for date night!  My boyfriend and I were served bruschetta and bread when we came in, we ordered drinks, shared a chicken Caesar salad, and ordered Pizza with plenty to take home.  Staff was so kind and generous.

Driving through from out of town. Had a bathroom emergency and showed up 2 hrs before they open. The owner and staff were absolutely great and understanding. They let us use their restrooms and offered to make us something to eat. Just like family. Food absolutely delicious. Will definitely be making a trip back.< /text>

The food is taste GREAT, generous portions, the service is fantastic.  This is the difference of a FAMILY OWNED Business and a Corporate one.  Each staff member works as a seamless team, making sure your dining experience is a good one.

We recently held an event for a movie documentary / shoot with about 50 Cyclists.  We called the owners let them know what we had in mind, and they accommodated us.  They normally close at 8pm on Tuesday Night, but they stood open for us.

We have been there several times, when they are busy and when they are not - You get the same level of dedicated service, everyone is hustling to make sure you are taken care of.  I support family owned business because their livelihood depends on it, However it is a now brainer to come back here when the food is delicious and the service is good.

They have an outdoor patio, a nice dessert selection and alcohol for those who like to indulge in Beer and Wine.< /Review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80c327938ee69a1d:0x1527e25f9f744727</gmapID></record>

<text>I'm a very foody person, and sometimes I’m just too picky and cannot stop to look for something better. Here I feel it’s a great place for me to eat, but I would work on their coffee, as it has to be Italian too! I can always recognize real Italian coffee from american. Hope, they will change it.<//text>< Date>

I just happened in after a target run sat down and right away they gave me a complimentary bruschetta and cheese bread ordered calamari served w two sauces aioli  and spicy marinara sauce i give this 5 stars service and oh they gave me a free gelatto and a 20% coupon to use next time.  Love this corner neighborhood feel think they could know you by name if you went often enough.< /Review>

Nice restaurant. Customer service is great. They serve the crostini with a really refreshing tomato/veg toppings and it is so delicious! The fettuccini is great and good sharing portions. They also serve gelatos with good flavors. We usually order take out and the service is fast. Definitely recommend this place!</review>

Fast, Friendly servers & Quality food, when comparing price to quality this establishment goes above & beyond with flavor & options e.g pizza, sandwiches, pastas, shrimp & more for a small semi quick eatery & so far all very good. Beer & Wine are available beer selection is standard i.e Bud, Miller, now Wine my wife enjoys & she always finds one she likes from there menu. Now pricing is $$ & as stated. As for 4star well location & parking r ok but of you've never been it is worth the drive, hope this helps, enjoy !!</Text>

Great food and service; I only wish they were open during lunch hours regularly also since I often work in the area.</review>

Having owned a restaurant in the past it is very difficult for me to find a restaurant that I'm totally 100% happy with not to mention an Italian restaurant, this place has the best food in town, the place in clean, bright and very friendly, they offer board games for the kids to keep them busy while everyone enjoy's an incredible meal.  When we are not able to dine in I will drive out of my way from our flower shop in Glendora to get take out.  TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE who wants quality food with very responsible prices.  LOVE THEM<//review>

The only place outside of NY that has good pizza. The quality is great. Prices and great and they deliver for cheap too. They delivered to my house 3 times  however, the last time they told me I was to far to deliver which is upsetting and weird because they did twice before. I still get it whenever I'm in the area which isn't to often but the pizza is always good. Give it a try</Review>

Absolutely delicious,  two pizzas for 24.00 bucks feeding 2 adults and kids. Very flavorful and not greasy at all. Its my 3rd time here and each time its been great. I urge Kellie the one star reviewer to try again. Everyplace has an off day....<//review>

Not at all what I expected after reading their ratings. The pizza thin and greasy. I could have got better at Little Cesar's and paid $15.00 less. I do not recommend this place. If you want a good pizza go to either Felipe's or La Bellas.< /Review>

Delicious New York Style Pizza.  Not as good as Bronx Pizza.  But definitely one of the best around.< /text>

I absolutely love this place! Their service is so friendly and their pizza and wings are so good. The crust is a legit New York style pizza crust with the extra flour and everything and the wings are perfectly cooked every time. I would highly recommend this place<//Review>

They are now offering individual pizzas. I had the Marguerite pizza and it was delicious! And for dessert I had the cannolis which were also very good. My order was ready when I was told it would be, and the staff are very nice! I use to go in for the slices, but the individual pizza was even better. I will be going more often. I hope they continue the individual pizzas even after the covid lockdown is over.<//Text>

<review>I stopped in here to see what it was all about. I am a big fan of Bronx pizza and I want to see how this would compare. I must say I am a fan of this restaurant. I will not go as far as to say it is the same as Bronx pizza because this is more of a Long Island style. The sauce is great the crust is great and the toppings are of a high quality. I like the fact that they have regular Italian style thin crust pizza as well as Sicilian pizza. The white stone is good the pepperoni mushroom was excellent and I also like the fact that they have garlic powder, parmesan as well and red chili flakes for you to put on your pizza. When I ordered my slice the employees here notice that the pizza was already  a little old so they made me fresh slices. This really shows the type of customer service that is needed in any service industry. I would recommend this pizza place and I will be back. The lady that was working at the front Ashley was very nice and very helpful. The gentleman that was cooking the pizzas name was Adrian he was the one that noticed that the pizza that they were going to serve me was a bit old so they made fresh ones. That to me shows the attention to detail that is needed. I am very happy with the service.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Gmap_id>0x80d95bade941c33f:0x5e8badb33ee3308b<//Gmap_id><Text>Today I went there and got two pies. The lady at the front was rude and charged me $19.00 per pie instead of $18.00 like the menu on the wall said. I tried to politely explain that you have to charge the advertised price but she told me that she charged what her "system" tells her to. I got frustrated and raised my voice becoming agitated by her not understanding where I was coming from. A man making the pizza heard this and came from around back, telling her to refund the difference. I don't like being the bad guy, and she shouldn't have made me push the issue.  Otherwise the order was fast and pizza was good.  Please update your menu prices to avoid this situation.

Went there again, same story, over charged me and I went through the same back a forth about being fair and charging the price on the menu. They are ridiculous, rude and fraudulent.Don't shop here, buy pizza at Gaetanos, at least they will charge you the menu price and the pizza will be better.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

I'm from Brooklyn so I know new York pizza and I do have to say they come as close as it gets. So yeah for the pizza it's worth it. Reason for the 4 stars is because I got the sausage calzone and it was not that good. But the pizza 5 stars</Text>

Great pizza if you like thin crust, I've been buying mine from Bronx pizza on Washington Blvd but this place now is my go to NY style pizza much better than Bronx pizza. Staff is very friendly. Puts Geatano's
Pizza down the street to shame.< /Review>

Called in at 4PM before starting to drive home, was told 20-25 minutes. Cool, it should be ready by the time I get there. I get there 40 minutes later, and discover that the order was never printed, so nothing has even been started. Not cool. Cashier says, 'You wouldn't mind waiting for it to be ready, right?' 'So... ANOTHER half hour?' 'Nah, like, 20-25 minutes...' That's a half hour on top of the 40 minutes already wasted, for a total of almost an hour and a half for a pizza that was supposed to take 20 minutes. I cancelled my order and left after that. I don't recommend going here unless you have spare time for the restaurant to waste.<//text>< user>

Been living in casa-de-oro for 19 years and this is the best pizza I’ve had here yet. The dough and sauce they use is especially good. Would highly recommend! Any of the other reviews that gave 1-2 stars were probably just salty cause they had a bad day or something and they took it out ok Mike’s so go ahead and disregard their review.</Review>

<Name>Jeff Kunu</Name><Date>1552533620535</Date><rating>1<//rating><Review>I'm here now, been here a few times. The food is not good, I'm always in the area. The sad thing they spent lots of money on a total remodel, but its always to HOT inside. It's so hot I'm very uncomfortable eating inside. No excuse for not having a good AC unit keeping it cool inside. The first girl they hired already quit to HOT.  I have been back a few more times, I hope I'm wrong I do hope Long Island's pizza makes it, but I feel they will not. I never see anyone inside eating just a few. It's very stuffy inside with a bad AC system not cooling it down to be  Comfortable for customers. The water in restroom never works that well to rinse your hands. With pizza hut so close not to sure. I will go back maybe but will only take my food to go. Plus the photo is of Starbucks to strange. Hopefully they make it. I eat all over in the area no other  Restaurant is so stuffy. Plus if you never see people inside eating it drives  Customers away. 10-11-2018 Stoped in again was going to get a few slices to go looked over the pizza it looked like it was 10 hours old . I just left went to pizza hut it was great. I can't think of any reason to eat there anymore. I have tried it three times really not good and always something not right. To hot, pizza not fresh looking bad. Not for me hopefully they stay in business but I don't think they will.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

< Review>
Went for the Covid shot. It was Awesome. I parked at 1255pm and went to get the shot was back in my car by 130pm. This event is set up very well. Line looks long but moves really fast. Lets see if the 2nd shot goes as smoothly. Thank you Santa Clara County!😁<//Review>

I went there for my first vaccine shot this morning. This is the best large vaccination site in Santa Clara county. Very efficient. Lines move rapidly. Check ins are quick and easy. I moved directly to the inoculation station. Valley medical administers the vaccine with a 2 cm needle. I didn't feel even a poke. Perfect vaccination.
I recommend this site for their organized effort. I had no side effects.</Text>

Great place to get covid vaccination. The setup is well staffed and reminds me of the ride lines at Disneyland. But watch out for the massive divit in the dirt parking lot, its a doozy, especially if you have a small car like my Prius. And for kicks, there's a cardboard Dr Fauci to take pictures with. 🤣</text>

It is very interesting place for teens and adults. You can spend several hours here because there are at least 5 maps where you can play various types of games.
We've played medic, president, castle etc.
Instructors are very careful about your safety. They can always offer you more scenarios.

There are many parking lots available.
There is no need to wait in line, you are starting game as soon as you are ready.</text>

<Review>Attended the model train show in March. Parking across the street was ok. Building was ok. Being charged $4.50 at the ATM was total joke. The city is making a bundle on that. Overall experience was simply ok.< /Review><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<Review>Not worth the money spent at all. The dinosaurs were made nicely and were in fact very lifelike and big, but the whole experience was not what was expected. The mechanical baby dinosaurs were pretty cool and so was sitting on the big dinosaurs but that was about it. Arrive as early as possible so your not stuck waiting in long lines. Definitely over priced unfortunately because it was something we were really looking forward to.<//Review>< pics>

Attended the model train show in March. Parking across the street was ok. Building was ok. Being charged $4.50 at the ATM was total joke. The city is making a bundle on that. Overall experience was simply ok.<//text>

<Review>The SCC Fairgrounds holds a special place in my heart. Many childhood memories with family and friends. So glad that I’m able to bring my kids to this yearly event. This year my daughter is entering her artwork!!

I especially love the community exhibits, artwork, performances and animals.  The outdoor music shows and rides give it such a fun summer vibe.  And the variety of food is oh so wonderful- creamed corn, steak sandwiches, funnel cakes, cinnamon rolls...Yum!   Cleanliness and availability of public restrooms is a key factor to me and they are doing a good job with this.   I hope it continues to grow in popularity and support while keeping it safe for all to enjoy< /Review>< pics>

What a dump the city of San Jose is not providing quality spaces for smaller or medium events. Parking in the dirt but San Jose fairgrounds 5 minutes from downtown?
Where is the redevelopment funds going? More importantly where is the billion+ dollars in property tax money going? It certainly not in the public school system. State scores for San Jose are low or barely passing.
Silicone valley place of the greatest minds and education is below average.</review>

She's johnny-on-the-spot when it comes to organizingthe RV's whether they are trailer or self driven into the slots that is convenient for them. The rates are very good and we are enjoying our stay here. The neighbors around us are friendly & helpful as well. It was a nice reprieve from driving across country from Florida to come to a place that welcomed us immediately!! 😊😊🙂< /text>< Pictures>

<text>Every time I visit this place, I want to like it. Unfortunately, the place is run down and badly in need of repair and upkeep. The parking lot is broken down and confusing, parking rates are high. The grounds at the fairground are old and ignored. Surely they can generate for business for themselves being in the heart of silicon valley if they spend money at keeping the place up.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCPklkQKw_eSmWkR0vXKv7v_pzMg3h6XailNO-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1540436182631, 'text': 'Hi Ankur! Due to having one to three year leases on the fairgrounds for a number of years, no one has wanted to put money into repairs or improvements.

Terrain Race was held there. Advertised as a 5k run (actually about 2.75 miles according to my GPS watch) with mud and obstacles was fun but not up to par with the more popular mud runs. No overhead monkey bars or rings to swing from but walls to climb over and a heavy tire to flip. Overall a decent intro to obstacle runs.<//text>

< review>
A sad fair, the organizers utterly failed and I don’t even want to give 1 star, but I’m forced otherwise I can’t post this.
Santa Clara County is one of the most profitable counties in California because we are ground zero for the high tech industry, such as Google. I/we went to the fair last night and was shocked by the lack of actual county representation. The ‘County Fair’ should show case the bests of the county.

The fair is literally the worst fair I had ever been to in my life, we were there Friday from 6-8pm. We left out of sheer boredom.

1.) The main entrance advertisement sign that’s supposed to be facing the street is actually backwards, so u don’t know what’s even going on in there if u drive by.
2.) Stage highlights: square dancing & Vietnam dancers - this was the highlights. That’s it for Friday Night.
3.) The approximately 10k sq ft art building had no climate control, so it was really hot and had stale air - not a single person in the art building.
4.) The location is the area where 99% crime and murders happens in Santa Clara County. Why is this the location for the County Fair? That makes no sense at all.
5.) The sheep and rabbits were cool, but then there were several cages with fake chickens in the FFA/4H chicken area. Why would we want to see fake animals in the live animal area?

As far as the rides, etc. it reminded me of being in a fly by night cheap carnival.

I conclude, I/we will never go back it’s just not a true snapshot representation of beautiful Santa Clara.< /review>

I can just picture this manager sitting on the couch watching TV ignoring phkne calls and texting everyone so they don't miss the price is right! 😂🤥

Went to reptile show, 1 building. Parking paid across street, but disabled parking not too far. Think I could have gotten closer but 1st time there. Set up with plenty of room and bathrooms easy to access, no waiting, clean. Had fun.< /review>

We have been coming to the Santa Clara County Fairgrounds the past 3 years for the Island Reggae Festival.. love, everything about IRF.. the food, entertainment, meeting new people, the vendor's and of course the  music. I like the fact that the performers walk around and interact with their fans by taking pictures and signing autographs... can't wait until IRF 2019.</text>

Second review. We saw Volta there and the show was absolutely and breathtakingly amazing. Five of us went and took one car. approaching and getting into the park was fairly easy parking was a little bit difficult even though I am disabled. However the big disappointment was after the show when we were trying to get out. It was almost impossible to get out of the parking lot because of the haphazard traffic directions. That was one person directing traffic from every witch Way and people were getting impatient after about 40 minutes.< /Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>I'm 3 years new to the area having moved down from the NW.  I was really looking forward to taking in a local fair having not been able to the last couple of years. Went 8/2/15 and arrived about 20 minutes early thinking that it had opened at 10am - didn't open till 11am.  What an experience.  Security lined women up in one line and men in another in front of the gate. I've never seen this done before in America. I felt like I was in a Nazi camp.  I even saw small children cry because there dad had to go in the men's line nowhere near his family like the rest of us.  This is supposed to be a family event! Unheard of!  This fair is VERY small and I knew that, but the lack of participation by the community as witnessed by the incredibly small displays in photography, art, food, and vendors and everything else you would expect in a fair made this place worthless.  The only thing that was enjoyable was the lack of crowds. Obviously the locals have been here before and know not to come back.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Good to have the faire back.  Enjoyed the pepper steak and the Phillies steak.  The smoked turkey leg was good and worth the price.  Don't bother with the foot long corn dog.  Definitely not worth the price.  The corn bread covering the skinniest hot dog I have ever seen was tough!  The kids enjoyed it though.  They liked seeing the small animals as the large animal barn was closed.  Enjoyed the sea lion exhibit for both the show and the valuable information.  They rode  the ponies, petted the animals and had a great time on the bungee jump.  Spent a great deal of time and energy on the walk on water attraction. They enjoyed the carnival rides and went on some some more than once.  They played the games and were treated well by all the people working the rides and games.  It was a good time had by all.  The kids were exhausted at the end of the day!< /Review>

<text>It is a Fantastic piece of land that allows many versitile functions to be realized.  The fairgrounds is basically a large dirt field which allows for the wind to blow dirt throughout the air, which is most unpleasant to breath in.  I realize CA has been in a state of drought which handicaps many possibilities,  still landscaping upkeep would be an excellent wise investment to keep most of the dirt from being kicked up and inhaled, as well as making the grounds safer to walk by eliminating uneven ground & holes along the walkways.  Iv seen Brilliant low/no water landscaping that could improve that great space of land.
Look forward to seeing the grounds become beautiful.</text>< Gmap_id>

Went here for the first time to the South Bay VegFair. It was awesome. There's a lot of shade and the bathrooms are clean with a lot of stalls. Lots of benches to sit. If the crowd was bigger it might've been harder to find a spot to sit but the crowd was light enough to be able to move around and find good spots to hang out. Nice lawn and trees cool the area down nicely.</Review>

This will seriously be a handful of the LAST fairgrounds left in the Bay Area. As land becomes valuable and land owners get greedy, these venues will disappear. Go see the 4H kids who raise and show their animals here at the end of Summer. The Santa Clara County  4H still does a lot of their business here!< /text>

Parking was $10 for the event we attended. Right across the street from the entrance. Easy to get in and out of. Fairgrounds were clean and looking good. They had a motorcycle dirt track and a couple paint ball fields with inflatable obstacles/coverage.< /text>

It would be irresponsible of us to ask for grants or donations because who knows if the land would even be available before we got through planning, permitting, building, etc.! We are pushing for a 15 year lease by the end of the year that will allow us the time to fix these problems and put the fairgrounds back on the map.'}< /response>

It was okay, no walking Dino's as advertised. However, the children loved it. 10 year old boy's may get bored of this attraction within 30 minutes. The Nacho's are excellent.< /text>

<Review>I was there for the Circus du Solei
Place was so dark, an the pavement in the parking lot need to be fix. Same for the white lines to divided parking spaces, employee wasn't clear about make direccion to the area that was in my ticket.

We went to see Train Show.  The parking was confusing as there was no sign pointing to Train Show parking lot.  We got there early so the parking lot looked empty/closed.  Figured it out though.  The model railroad setups were nice with some of them having push button controls for kids to control small details.  At least half the floor was shops selling pricey trains and landscapes and figures.  Looked like good stuff for the otaku crowd.  Too fancy for nubes.  Outside was a bounce house and ride on train ride (must buy tickets).

Tickets were $10 for adults and kids free.  A search will find a $1 off coupon code.  Parking was $10.<//Review>

<review>This is a huge ground. I visited this place for Durga Puja Celebration. The experience was good. There are huge hall-rooms. The dining area is big. The place is clean and well maintained. It has grass lawns. Farmers markets are held in the weekends(not sure about the timings)</review>< pictures>

Every time im there i have an experience not worth going back. I dont even want to comment because of bad memories but i will.
1. Bubble Run- Why on EARTH would you have a bubble run through the mud and not allow us to use the water to hose ourselves off before getting into our vehicles?? And WHY was there no security to make sure nobody drowned trying to move past the people standing in the bubbles taking selfies??

2. Dinosaur Tour- You have an amazing publicist. That event was horrible!!! For it to be so expensive, all there was were stationary dinosaurs that hardly moved. The T-Rex literally opened and closed its jaws.. That's it!!
The commercials made it seems as though it would be some life-changing eye opening experience. It was a complete let down.
And to top it off, there were things to do like the virtual reality, basketball hoop, balloon pop, face paint, etc. BUT they cost 1 ticket each person. Get this, the tickets were $5 Each. For my 4 kids to get their faces painted =$20! Such a rip off.< /review>

<Text>Not what it used to be in it's prime.  Just a bunch of old townies running the place into the ground.  It would be a shame to see it go, but maybe the best thing for the townies and their thieving pockets to sell the land and be done with the fair grounds.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<review>It was the South Bay vegfest. It's the 2nd annual, so they're still working to get this off the ground. The entrance was for two events: vegfest and miniature house convention. It was confusing which was which, because they were right together. They should have divided the exhibits better.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Review>We were here for the Rave Run at night. You can't complain about the road being bumpy because it's not designed for a 5km run. But nothing can beat running with neons, lights great music and open bar after party at the goal. We all had an amazing time.</Review>< Pictures>

What a sad scene. I Can't believe that this is so depressing of a fair in the middle of silicon valley. So much disposable income here and the promoters can't even get decent food in the event. ALL the food was so bad. Very little attendees. So disappointing.< /Text>

<text>I hate this place. Review is biased because of the horrible experience during "Indian Street Food Festival".
1. After waiting in long queue for parking they asked for $10 cash, I had to find cash from near by 7eleven and join the queue again.
2. The food festival was a scam, they didn't allow us to enter the venue even with pre-paid tickets of $10 each. How can they allow such event!!!
3. By the way there are big pot holes in the parking lot and they are almost invisible on a rainy day.

Can't think of going there for some other event as well.<//text>< Rating>

<Resp>{'time': 1542320057907, 'text': 'Hi Michael! Thanks for leaving us some feedback. We agree that we need a fresh coat of paint and a thorough cleaning. For the last 15 years, we have been receiving 1 to 3 year leases on the property. It would be irresponsible of us to ask for grants or donations because who knows if the land would even be available before we got through planning, permitting, building, etc.! We are pushing for a 15 year lease by the end of the year that will allow us the time to fix these problems and put the fairgrounds back on the map. If you would like to help us turn the ship around, we are always looking for volunteers :)'}</Resp><rate>3<//rate></record></dataset><record>

Come here every few months for the San Jose Toy Show. Bathrooms are always clean, staff are friendly and there is usually (paid) parking in the lot right across the street! That lot also hosts a night time flea market during the week.</text>
