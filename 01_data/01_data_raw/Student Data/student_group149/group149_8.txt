Great service and excellent variety of options for vegetarians! I love that I could completely customize my burgers and everything turned out delicious!< /text>

I celebrated my graduation yesterday in this great restaurant. I am glad to say that we enjoyed a tremendous evening and the venue was evidently one of the reasons for the outstanding evening. The team  participated in a very nice style, the meals were delicious and my buddies were extremely  overjoyed. We shall definitely visit again for more celebrations. Thank you very much.<//review>

If you like the non meat options as well, we are set to bring a patty that is made completely from plants but it feels as close as you can get to biting into delicious, every so satisfying meat.\nIt's the real deal.

<Text>Great service. Great choices. Besides different yummy meat choices there are 3 veggie option: salmon, falafel, and a homemade veggie patty. A little too much sauce, will ask for light sauce and crispy fries next time.< /Text>< Time>

SCAM! DO NOT ORDER!!! I made $200 order online 24 hours upfront. Card was charged and confirmation email received with the location address. Next day by the time my wife came to pick up and they said they don’t have it. She provided them with confirmation number and all the info but they say they don’t care. They say they not related to the official website (what?) and I have to make another order with them, pay another $200 and wait for an hour.  Two kids (4 and 1) had to wait for an hour in the car with family friend - that was a mess. 20 adults guests and 15 kids on the party had to wait for an hour for the host and food. Total disaster and the party was ruined. This company DO NOT CARE about customers and have no idea what customer service is about. Respect yourself and never use this company “services”.< /text>

Well this is my very second time trying this ever. This time I brought my kids and they absolutely enjoyed it. I absolutely love The 100 Cokes Machine...
(Strawberry Sprite) is my favorite... We love the Ranch as well. The cashier Angie was very helpful and she explained each item so my kids will understand... Overall the experience was great!!!< /review>

<text>First time at a Bugerim.   I was very impressed with the design and use of space. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu items. I was fortunate enough to meet the owner.  Passionate and knowledgeable about customer service and really cared about making myself and other customers welcome.  Now to the grub: the food was excellent.  It came out hot; but not over cooked.  Definitely not the usually fast food burger joint.  It’s at another level. Prices are very reasonable.< /text>< Pics>

<Text>I was visiting a friend in Marina Del Rey and he said I have to try this place. He was raving about for days before I arrived. Now I have had plenty of burgers in my life, but I have never had a burger party in my mouth. The fact that they make these burgers sized to order more than 1 is genius! I order the TRIO and got to taste their lamb burger, and then their salmon burger and then their exceptional Wagyu beef burger and the experience was like none that I have ever had. We even tried their falafal and it was tasty. Everything there is incredible and I am looking forward to  going back again ASAP!<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1526092546894, 'text': 'Thank you for the kind words and the GR8 review!

<text>This place is a little chaotic at times because they train new people. Even with very few patrons inside, ordering could take a while. Once ordered, food arrives quickly and the taste is fantastic. The crew is extremely nice and try to take care of you.

Once the ordering process is streamlined, I will update it to 5 stars.

Drove all the way here on Sunday but they were closed even though posted hours said open. Wanted to leave one star review on the spotbbut then remembered how I felt when a douchebag left my business unwarranted one star review.<//text>< pics>

Awesome burgers that come in fun slider-style sizes (but slightly bigger at 3oz each) with tons of options for customization. Try the Spanish Beef for a little kick!< /Review>

< Review>
Sliders Sliders Sliders.....tiny bite size! This place is create-A-wait style ordering system. So after you wait half an hour for the person in front of you to order, and the brand new employee stares at the electronic register like she is mapping coordinates for a lunar landing....you now give your 5min long order, which you have to repeat several times for the clerk to input correctly. Now you wait for your overly complicated food to be made, and 10min later (now 50mins since you entered) they bring you a slider!! yes thats right some genius thinks that people in Venice and Marina Del Rey are going to wait an hour and order multiple tiny burgers to be fed McDonalds quality meat and consume all that bread!!! Now you can SEE bartaps on the counter...but no beer. Also, the drink machine is a nightmare of “unavailable” items limited to i believe water, coke, and KoolAid. To the owners, don’t worry about the beer license, you won’t be there long enough to get it..i do NOT RECOMMEND!!!</Review>

Got here on a sunday at 7:00 pm and employees had closed the restaurant and were hanging out outside in their car. Times are clearly posted until 9:00pm. If this is not the case, they should update their front door and Google.< /Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) We were in the mood for burgers today, so we went to the burgers around the corner. If you want to eat here, mine has a choice of 1, 2 and 3 burgers in the menu with drinks and a side dish. All burgers can be filled individually. There are also fish, vegetarian and vegan patties. If you fancy onion rings and french fries, there is also the possibility to make half a half. Tasty, delicious and good portions. I can only recommend it.

(Translated by Google) When you order veggie and you get beef steak twice, it's just lamentable and the fries were cold !!! And the staff is just very bad.
To flee +++

<review>Michelle was nothing short of a miracle worker with my colour correction. See photo evidence below. Michelle took the time to do a phone consultation with me prior to my appointment as I had to travel 90 minutes to go see her. Michelle was thoughtful and confident in her explanation of what she was thinking to do to correct the disaster. I recommend Michelle so highly that my three hour commute seems inconsequential. I am on my way back for another appointment today, 5 weeks later. (Review somehow didn’t post on my first visit).
Edit- please note that the colour disaster did not happen at Dean Anthony salon, it was a mess that was done elsewhere.<//review><GmapID>0x80dd3036561e04f7:0x30f798a962fbc169<//GmapID><rate>5< /rate>< Pictures>

<Text>I have had appointments with jenni and will, they are both awesome. The salon is general has a nice vibe and you definitely get what you pay for here. A little pricier than some of the other salons, but I continue to come back. I think they are usually pretty booked, but they respond quickly to appointment requests online.</Text><username>Isabelle Toulis<//username><date>1618087456280</date><pictures>None<//pictures>< gmap_id>

I have been going to this place for the past couple of years, and they have always given me excellent cuts. I have long curly hair, and they know exactly what to do with it and have given me a lot of great tips for styling. It is somewhat expensive, but deserved.< /review>

I moved to CA from NY one year ago.  In NY, I had the same amazing stylist for 17 years.  He was a master at cutting hair.  I found someone I liked in LA and when I moved to Long Beach I was dreading starting the hunt for a stylist again.  I even considered driving back to LA. But I tried Michele the owner at this salon.  And she gave me a FANTASTIC, AMAZING cut.  As if she’d been cutting my hair for 17 years.  I wasn’t sure I’d find another master stylist near home and I thought it would take me a few months, but nope... found her pretty quickly thanks to the many stars this salon has earned.  Michelle was patient, kind, and took the time to learn exactly what I wanted.  And bang trims are free!  I’ll definitely be coming back to her as long as I live in LB/OC area. Such a relief to find someone who can cut my hair as well as my NY stylist!</Text>

Jill has the magic touch!!! I've been to many high end salons, but I'm so grateful to have found Jill at Dean Anthony's. It started with "Can you do lines for me?" Her answer was "Yes!"

Jill is legit with her skills! She does my cuts, styling and now also coloring. She's done an amazing job at everything. She was able to lift my stubborn dark Asian hair to this darker shade of blue that I've always wanted. I feel gorgeous and I'm a dude! She is the only stylist I let touch my hair now. Her personal touch to my own style is awesome too!

Needless to say, there's always a waitlist for Jill when I call, but I happily wait until it's my turn! Cheers! :)</text>

I visited Dean Anthony Salon for the first time last week and I am extremely happy I did. From the moment I walked in I felt the warm welcome. Rob, the front desk receptionist was so amazing and immediately asked if I wanted lemon cucumber water or coffee. The lobby was well decorated and very clean. I was seen exactly on time and was treated with respect. Will, a stylist I found on Instagram, was extremely charming, sweet and very knowledgeable. He was asking me so many questions to really understand my hair but he also taught me so much. I ended up buying all of the products he used on me that day! I am so grateful for everyone there and I can’t wait for my next visit in April. I would 100% recommend this salon to my friends and family.</Review>

Dean Anthony is a first class salon where you always feel valued as a guest, from the front desk staff to the assistants who wash your hair.  Everyone is so friendly and welcoming.  Right when you walk in the door, you are greeted and offered a beverage.  Jessica is a wonderful master stylist and a friend who I enjoy spending time with while she makes me beautiful!  She is so friendly and personable and a great listener!  I trust her and give her total creative control.  Every time I walk out of Dean Anthony, I feel so happy!< /Review>< pictures>

Very impersonal and superficial vibe. Appreciate consulting cost right off the bat, but could be done in a more collaborative fashion. Never heard of a complimentary wine limit in my years of going to salons, just one glass. At least offer 2 if you’re having to sit there for nearly 2-3 hours getting hair highlighted.< /review>

I lost my favorite hair dresser years ago do to a move to be closer to ailing Mom, I can't believe Kyle *s first time doing my hair and I love it. I have found my new hair dresser.  Thanks Kyle, I love my hair.

A beautiful salon in the cute area of second street, and it’s filled with talented stylists. I’ve worked with a few people here and have loved their work every time. They offer you a drink when you step in, they use amazing products, and the whole process is just really pleasant and nice. The only downside is parking, but it’s still worth it!<//text>

Outstanding service, as always.  From the front desk (I sincerely hope Rob is compensated well as the face of Dean Anthony, as he is everything), to shampoo bowl, to services, all is a pleasure.  If you have unusually thick and/or curly hair, I highly recommend Jessica.  She REALLY knows how to cut your hair!  There is hope!!  The guys in your life should definitely be seeing David.  He's amazing at what he does, and the essential oils he uses during his services are mind-altering.<//text>

Melissa is an amazing person first and foremost, and the best stylist I’ve ever had in my 12 years in So Cal.
I am so happy to have found her after trying many stylists a year here, a year there...Every appointment I’ve had with Melissa these last 2 years, I leave excited to show off her work, something that is so hard to find!  A+++< /Text>

<text>I visited for the first time yesterday and I could not be more happy with my experience. First, the receptionist Rob helped me pick the right stylist to see and he couldn't have been more wonderful and welcoming. After 12 years of going to the same stylist, I had to find a new one and Rob helped put me at ease that I was in good hands.  He asked me all the right questions so he could match me with the right stylist. It can be really difficult and overwhelming to figure out how to find a new hair stylist, right?

My appointment was with Jessica Sager, and from the moment I sat in her chair I felt completely comfortable. Our first appointment included plenty of intro time to discuss my hair and the kind of color and services she thought would be best for me. She immediately put me at ease given that she knew I was nervous about trying a brand new stylist after such a long time.

I have to say that working with her was the best thing I have done for my hair in years. I was expecting her work to be good, but actually my hair and color came out better than I could have imagined. I'm a blonde, and her ideas and suggestions for how she wanted to highlight and add base color were incredible. She also used techniques that were up to date and it was clear that she's on the cutting edge of hair styling. It's the next day and I'm still so happy at finding Jessica at Dean Anthony. It feels too good to be true, but it's not. I already booked my next two appointments with Jessica becasue that's how excited I am about my hair!

Thanks to everyone at the salon!<//text>< Pictures>

It is a beautiful salon. The people working the front desk were absolutely delightful. I got a haircut and service from Jonathan. I am extremely happy with the results and provided knowledgeable feedback on any questions I had. I would definitely recommend and will be returning.<//review>

<Text>What an exceptional experience! From booking the appointment, to the service provided during my appointment, to the follow up phone call the next day.  I truly felt pampered and appreciated the communication from my stylist regarding my cut, ideas on how to improve hair growth, and scalp care.  The entire team at Dean Anthony was amazing!  When my stylist informed my I didn’t need to schedule an appointment until 12 weeks later (I’m attempting to grow my hair out), I was immediately disappointed!  I’m not sure I will be able to wait that long until being so spoiled again!< /Text><gmapID>0x80dd3036561e04f7:0x30f798a962fbc169</gmapID><response>None< /response>< user_id>

I really love Melissa. My only complaint is I have curly hair and usually leave with it wet. The only bummer is she doesn't get to see it when it dried and whatever products she used in my hair yesterday made it super limp and SUPER frizzy. It's a bummer when I pay so much money and then don't like it when it dries and want to wash it over again. Small criticism but it's happened twice now so I just wanted to say something. Otherwise, I LOVE my color! Thank you!<//Review>

I’ve been coming here for over a year, I see Jonathan and he’s amazing. Seriously, he’s very talented. If your looking for a touch up, new do, blow out, etc... come here.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><UserId.>106071481140296748166< /UserId.>< Time>

Recently started going to Dean Anthony Salon and seeing Nassim. I have a pixie cut and every time Nassim gives me such a great cut. I actually left several  hairdressers previously as I wasn't consistently getting cuts that I loved, but every time I leave the salon I'm very happy with my cut. Plus all the staff are so friendly and welcoming!<//Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>This review is so over due !! I've been getting all my hair cuts with David the barber over 15 years. He began his career at a barber shop and is now at an awesome spot,
Dean Anthony Salon- off 2nd street. I've tried many barbers and stylist and can't seem to find anyone that cuts my hair the way David does. Don't look any where else, this is the place and David is your Barber. Did I mention, I drive from PASADENA to Long Beach. I know, crazy right?!... but David is the best< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I heard about this place through my barber which is D's beauty salon. So I went to try it out and they were delicious price is fair and the spicy garlic chicken wings are awesome. I have already came back to this place for more and I might get more later on haha<//text>

Food: portions and taste are great 4 stars
(Almost no fry egg at all.)

Service: Poor 1 star.
(Waited 15mins to order the food, 40 mins for just 1 item shrimp fry rices. Asking for napkins, the Waiter said not available.)< /review>

I've been coming here since the 80's... Which should say it all. Same great recipes and portions, no one compares. Combination chow mein, fried rice, fried prawns, garlic fried chicken wings, Mongolian beef, kung pao chicken, everything thing on the menu.</text>

<text>I've been enjoying take out from China Station for the last 25 years and I've yet to find anything that compares! I grew up about 5 minutes from the restaurant, but kept going as we moved across town. Nothing else is as good! I've since moved out of the area, but it is the first place I think of eating at every time I come back into town. The hot and spicy chicken with garlic sauce, chicken chow mein, and sweet and sour pork are my favorites. Oh, and the wantons! They're amazing! China Station is the first take out I ordered when quarantine started to ease up. Ordering ahead of time has never worked for us - we have to order in-person and wait while they make the food - but I just accept that and know it's worth the wait every time! I just ate there and I'm already craving more!< /text>< UserId.>

If you haven't visited this little gem yet, you should. My family's avorite dish is their fried garlic chicken wings, which you can get mild or spicy. Also, the potstickers are delicious. This is my go to Chinese restaurant in Fremont. It is family owned.<//review>

Home style dishes. Taste, presentation & quantity okay. Decor & ambience are not fancy. Better take out than sit in. Chicken wings are good. The crust is very crunchy, good if you fancy it that way. Prices are a tad higher than expected. I would go again.< /Text>

<review>Unclear if they are ever open. We’ve gone for a few days in a row during their listed hours which hangs from their door but nobody is around and doors are locked. Really weird. And nobody ever answers the phone. Complete waste of time especially when there are sooo many other places to eat around here...< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Been going here since I have been about 10 years old. The owner watched me grow up and I watched his kids grow up. Lovely hard working family. We call the fried garlic chicken wings Crack chicken they are beyond good. Haven't found any Chinese place serve wings like them. China station is 2 thumbs up for me.</Review>< Pictures>

Little hole in the wall place, but good food at a reasonable price. We used to live in the neighborhood and we still like this better than any other Chinese food place we've tried in the area.<//review>

<rating>1</rating><Text>Good tasting food, especially the fried chicken wings, but the service is lacking and rude. They might give the incorrect food when ordering take out.
I ordered two dishes over the phone. When I arrived to pick up my order, I was handed the wrong order. I had to wait 10 min for them to fix my order.  When I came home and checked my bag, one of the items was still incorrect. I went back to the restaurant to show them that my order was still incorrect and the man who originally took it refused to fix it. He showed me what I ordered on a paper slip (which was incorrect) and insisted that if I wanted the dish I originally ordered, he would have to charge for another one.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x808f9592abd700e5:0xc43088dc22dddde1</Gmap_id>< Date>

My recruiter is very responsive and personable. I have NEVER had any issues with them!! This agency even has PTO! None of my co workers with other agencies have this benefit!! Also the rates are equal or higher than most other agencies!! Everything feels more like family than business and for that I would choose stability over any other agency!!

<Text>I have worked with Stability since January, 2021. They are attentive and responsive to my needs as a travel RN. They work ahead to make sure assignments are contiguous without any interruptions…and there pay rates are competitive with all other local and national agencies. The recruiter (Molly) and all staff are kind, courteous and prompt with everything I have needed thus far. I have thoroughly enjoyed working with this organization!<//Text>< pictures>

My Recruiter has been great (Brittney) helping me through my first contract! I feel like all the staff involved are super responsive and keep you up to date. She worked with me when I negotiated contracts and I felt supported! So far Stability has been great!< /review>

I have been so impressed with their professionalism, compassion, effective communication and kindness.  I can’t say enough good things about my experience working for them.  If I have concerns they address them right away.  When I was out sick Sam and Anna sent me a card in the mail.  I get weekly check-in messages.  I highly recommend working with Stability.< /Review>

My recruiter, and other staff I have had the pleasure of interacting with, are all so friendly and helpful. My recruiter is responsive, and even reached out while she was on vacation to check on me! I've worked with other agencies in the past, but Stability is next level when it comes to making your travel nursing experience as seamless as possible! Special shout out to Lindsay (best recruiter ever) and Tracy. Amazing people to work with.<//review>

<review>This is my first experience as a travel nurse and I am extremely happy that I chose Stability Healthcare. My experience with the staff has been phenomenal. Everyone seems genuinely interested in my well-being and wanting me to have a good experience and succeed. I especially appreciate the fact that they will reach out randomly just to find out if things are going well. I definitely would recommend this agency.< /review>< Pictures>

Stability Healthcare has been amazing at helping  me transition into travel nursing. I talked to many recruiters when looking into travel nursing and Chad in particular stood out. He was always so kind and quick to respond. Everyone I've had the pleasure of speaking to from Stability has been just as kind and it truly feels like they all care about you enjoying your assignment.<//review>

I really like the company. Their transparent about expectations. The staff work well with me to accommodate my needs. So far i have had no issues with paychecks or reimbursement for contracts. There is a good effort to set up contracts with different hospitals. The company is smaller which keeps things personable. The only complaint so far is that there is no way for the company to reimburse for essential certifications like basic life support. Though, the staff did a good job explaining the reasoning. I hope to keep working with them in the future. The company has good communication and contract pay rates.<//Text>

Stability Health has an amazing system and employees.  The hiring process was very simple which is rare.  Someone was always available to answer my questions.
I know my recruiter went above and beyond to get me the best pay and benefits.
I have worked previously with companies that I feel was less than honest about benefits, such as PTO.
I’m now sure how Stability Health treats their staff, but they are doing something right!  I have yet to speak to someone that wasn’t pleasant. It’s as if they all love their job and it shows and it keeps me excited to be a part of their team.
At this point, I would not consider traveling with another company.  I don’t feel like a number.
I don’t know how they do it!   I recommend Stability Health to every traveler I meet.  I tell them they would be making g a huge mistake to go with any company😎<//Text>

Just started traveling again and Stability out performed so far. Staff are very attentive and professional . Response is superb! I have worked 3 consecutive days and forgot to send my hours but they have your back! Reminder is precious when your mind is consumed with work. Jordon did very well in finding the job suitable for my needs, and recommended places to stay when I asked. Debbie is constantly in touch checking on me! Thank you very much! I am very satisfied and happy working with Stability. Looking forward To more assignments in the future.< /text>

Stability is by far the best travel company out there. I‘ve literally never had a single issue with them. Their rates and jobs are 100% transparent. They are timely and efficient. They are available and care about what’s happening. I would choose them over every other company. I believe their rates are very competitive and are usually very high. The payroll dept is also amazing. I would also recommend the for a first time traveler as well. AAAAA+++++</Review>

<review>Stability Healthcare was who I chose for my first time as a travel nurse because they were the first agency that I found that had an assignment listed in the city I wanted to work. But I am SO HAPPY I stumbled upon them first. From beginning to end, there is someone always there for you and providing answers to any questions you have. My recruiter, Brittney, has been an absolute rockstar and works so hard to make sure I get the best possible contract and rates. The rest of the staff is just as helpful- they remind me when I forget to submit my time sheets, make sure my contract hospital information and forms are properly handled, send me encouraging texts, and are all so helpful! If you’re on the fence about using a lesser known (or smaller) agency- don’t be. The personalized time and attention to detail they have provided to me during my time traveling has made this such a good experience for me. Knowing someone is always available to help when I need them is such a comforting thing for someone who was super nervous to start travel nursing. I get texts from someone at least once a week it seems, to check in and make sure everything is going well. The benefits are fantastic too! My rate is always comparable to any other travel nurse on the unit and they make sure I’m treated fairly within my facility. I cannot recommend my recruiter, Brittney, and her team at Stability Healthcare enough! They are wonderful!!!< /review><Resp>None</Resp><user_id>111452443306691382271</user_id>< Pictures>

Hi I’m Monika and I’ve been working for Stability for a little over 9 months now and I have nothing but great things to say about this company! As a single mom, working for Stability has been one of the most rewarding and exciting chapters of my life. My recruiter, Lindsay, has been a tremendous help, is always available when I need her, and stays on top of helping me get the best contracts. Thank you Stability for everything you do and for treating your nurses’ so well! I’ve never felt more appreciated to do what I do!<//text>

I decided to take the leap with travel nursing and Stability Healthcare has made it all possible, easy and worth it! They are very supportive and helpful. Matthew Payne is my recruiter and he is always very quick with responses and helping me with anything that I need. My first contract went so well that I extended after 13 weeks and am currently on my second one. The transition was very smooth. Thank you!!!</text>

On top of the process. On boarding easy. Very supportive staff. They are they for you via, call , text or email. And it's very easy transition ..  they encourage you to ask questions and make themselves available from the moment your hiring process starts. To even checking on you on first day assignment to the following week.<//Text>

This is my first time doing travel nursing and Stability Healthcare just made that experience worth keeping! They are very supportive, professional and responds really quickly with any questions or concerns you may have. It feels like I've known them for years now because of the kind of relationship they offer. They are very friendly, and you know you have a family in them even if you are only able to talk with them over the phone and not see them personally. I would highly, highly recommend them. If you want to switch to or try travel nursing, Stability Healthcare is the way to go!< /review>

This is / was my first experience doing travel nursing and I chose Stability Healthcare out of a sea of companies to choose from. I have been so happy with my experiences with all of the team members who have continued to assist me throughout my assignment(s). Everyone has been so very helpful, responsive,  and friendly. It has made such a difference, as travel nursing can be overwhelming- especially during these "COVID-times". I highly recommend this company and plan to continue to work with them! Thank you!< /Text>

<Text>Very happy I chose stability as a first time traveler. My recruiter Jordon has been amazing and very responsive. I had some issues in the beginning with my compliance person but Jordon worked hard to get it resolved and to get me started on time. Debbie is also awesome and always available to answer any questions I have. I have since extended my contract twice and plan to continue to use stability in the future. Highly recommend.</Text><Rating>5</Rating>< userid>

<review>I made the decision to start travel nursing which is already a kind of nerve racking experience just with alot of unknowns and questions, but from DAY 1 Stability Healthcare was there for me through the whole process from being submitted, through the compliance portion and even when I am on my contract they check in often! They made this whole experience wonderful and I couldn't be any happier than I am now in my nursing career. Everyone I have been in contact with at Stability Healthcare has been really nice and knowledgeable, I'm never left feeling stressed or unsure about what is going on. If you're thinking about making the leap to travel nursing, this is your sign and I 100% reccomend doing it with Stability Healthcare. ❤❤</review>< Resp>

My team has been responsive and very helpful! I love that Stability uses the ADP app to make the time card and pay information easily accessible. Their website is easy to use to send your recruiter jobs you are interested in. I do wish it was easier to sort jobs and select all states. This company is also recommended by Ebi from NurseLifeRN which is a vote of confidence in my opinion!</Review>

I recently completed my first contract with Stability Health and so far it has been the BEST experience I have had as a travel nurse.  If I had to pick out the best things about my experience, it would be the support from my recruiter(thanks Brittney!) and the layout of the website.  It really made understanding the pay packages a total breeze.  Happy to continue working with them!</Text>

I had previously been working with a different agency for travel nursing and then decided to make the switch to Stability. My recruiter (shout out to Chad) was very responsive and always kept on the lookout for jobs that I wanted. I was looking for a specific job probably way too far in advance and somehow Chad made it happen. All in all I have had a great experience with stability.< /Review>

My 2nd contract with Stability, same recruiter Chad. He's been doing a great job,  never feel alone or isolated. If he's off, another recruiter will be deputize to assist and or answer queries. Process is smooth and guided along every step of the way. The various departments are right on par. Accounts will follow up and remind you of timesheet submissions or even assist you during your busy schedule. Salary is on time weekly.  Professionalism is uppp! A good company to work with. . Highly recommended.  I must also congratulate Stability on a new observation, which you don't see often. That is each Stability representative now have a picture attached to their email! This allows you to connect the name to the face. Thumbs 👍up Stability!<//text>

The Onboarding process was very quick and smooth. I’m flexible and usually just worked the days the facility gave to me. However, the facility was very accommodating to my preferred schedule or changes if needed. Entering time work is done through an app, fast and easy. The facility also sends over a report weekly to make sure things match, so no need to have a staff member sign off daily. Stability did frequent check-in’s through text messages to see how things were going, I could tell they cared about my comfortability at the facility. I did not experience any issues which is a plus!! I will continue to work with Stability on future contracts!!</text>< Pics>

Stability Healthcare was a great company to work for. My assignment out in Boston as an RN went so smoothly I extended for a few more weeks.  If I ever had questions I had them promptly answered by my recruiter. They also helped me after I was exposed to Covid and got the virus. They got me the correct paperwork and helped me get paid for the two weeks I was sick and quarantined. It was a refreshing change to work for a healthcare company who helps you instead of marking it more difficult by having you jump through endless hoops. Lastly, I have to say using the ADP app is a great way to do the time clock. It is super easy to use and is definitely user friendly. I look forward to using this company for another contract in the future!<//Text>

<review>You have to trust that a travel company is reputable and listed as such on Highway Hypodermics. This company found me some great travel assignments and I highly recommend Meg Vernon as a recruiter as she is very ethical.  It’s often tough working with facilities where pay is short and hours are long but that’s what is great about travel, that you can switch assignments every 3 months. On my bucket list is Hawai and Miami next.< /review>< Pictures>

< Review>
I just finished a contract with this company and their practices are geared towards stealing. Although I was only required to work 5 (per diems split into 5 days) days a week, when I took a vacation they split my per diems into 7 days that way they would only have to pay for the 3 days I worked. The prior weeks my stipend was split into 5 days...my “recruiter” lied and blamed the IRS rules. Beware they will blatantly steal and quickly say it’s IRS requirements. It’s in your contract as well so they can rob you. First and last time I will work with this company. Another issue I faced was I was contacted saying I could only take 24 on call hours because the facility wasn’t paying them. When I interviewed I agreed to work 12-15 days of call per month, yet I was called and told no I cannot do that any longer. I’ve learned to just warn other people of what they may experience because I wish I would have been forewarned. This was the response I was given:

“I am checking with payroll but if you requested the time off and were not available then your stipend is divided by 7 and paid for the number of shifts you worked.  The policies around tax free money are pretty strict, we have to pay on a per day (per diem) basis when the full-time commitment is not met due to self cancelations.”

If you want to be lied to go with this company. There are bigger companies that do not steal as much as these people do.< /Review>

I have been doing travel nursing for about a year now, and Nima has by far been the worst recruiter I have worked with. I am getting paid $300-$400 a week less than my peers in the same exact unit. He is extremely hard to reach, and incredibly unreliable. In fact, I can always count on him being unreliable. Do yourself a favor, and if you go with this company, steer clear of Nima. Or, just go with a different company. Definitely glad my contract is almost up, and absolutely will not be renewing with him.</review>

<text>Rosie helped us every step of the way through the home-buying process. She was kind and helpful throughout our negotiation with the seller and escrow. She kept a positive outlook from start to finish, even when things got difficult. Her expertise and knowledge were vital to us successfully buying our home. I would highly recommend her to anyone looking to buy a house.<//text>< Name>

They do an excellent job guiding first time buyers through every step and explains every option if any. They work late and even on weekends which made it super convenient for me that I work Monday through Saturday 8 hours a day. They made my house buying experience very easy and non stressful.

<review>Being a first time home buyer and not knowing anything I was afraid. That's until I met Mrs. Rosalba Burgos "Rosie". She is a truly professional in her field and at the same time she has a great sense of humor. She made me feel as if I've known her all my life. That just made me feel confident that I was in the right place to buy a house. Every question I had she was always there to give an answer. My family and I really appreciate all her hard work and time. She is truly a blessing.< /review>< pics>

I couldn't have asked for better service. Joe Navarro and his team went above and beyond to provide as great quality service and us get a home loan when we didn't think we even had a chance. Thanks to Joe and his team we are now first time homeowners and we couldn't be happier. Any questions we ever had he was always happy to answer and when he wasn't available his assistant Jessica was always more than happy to help us with whatever we needed.  Overall our experience with Joe and his team was great. If you want someone who is going to go above and beyond to help you get a home loan and someone who knows what they're doing I would definitely recommend Joe and his team. They are friendly, reliable, trustworthy, professional and the list goes on and on. If you're looking to buy a home Joe and his team are the ones to go to.<//Review>

Other lenders turned us down after I explained our issue with the credit due to identify theft. Joe didn’t ; he did the total opposite and suggested we tried it out and see where we stood. Now a month later we own our first home!
Any questions I had he answered at any time of day. Between him and Jessica I am truly satisfied with my home buying experience.
I would definitely recommend him to family and friends.<//Text>

Couldn’t ask for a better experience, home buying is stressful. Joe Navarro goes above and beyond. The attention to detail and the desire to get the best for his clients really shows. My husband and i purchased a home in 2018 and have referred several of our closest friends and family to him</review>

My experience  with Signature Home lending has been nothing but amazing, I have found a loan officer and team that are helping me get a home in a few months, they made this process so easy and comfortable. I recommend this company especially to the younger generations, to get into your dream home and stop wasting money in renting. :)<//review>

<Text>Worse experience ever, first time home buyer. I would not recommend them at all. They do not communicate with you and they tell you things that after close of escrow theres issues. Throughout the process there was many mistakes.

Very disappointed with Joe Navarro, Cristina Valenzuela, and Martie Anderson...<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<review>A great little hole in the wall.  Not fancy, only a few tables, but it was really tasty.  We had a couple of rolls and a bento box.  They do not have fresh Ice Tee so thats a bummer...<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Resp>None</Resp><Rating>2<//Rating><review>It's really expensive for the quality of food you get. I ordered lobster rolls & they were drenched in mayo and the crawfish wasn't fresh. The bento box and teriyaki bowl are the only decent and safe things to order remotely good and fresh. But they need to cook their tempora thoroughly. It comes out all hard potatoes & veggies.

Their servers and customer service has improved... but I'd rather go across the street to the other sushi spot for fresh & authentic sushi.<//review>< Pics>

Service was nice. The food was ok. The ambiance was calm and cozy. They could use a heater however. Give em try! You won't not like it :)</text>

<text>DISGUSTING. The women taking my order was very rude and was not wearing gloves or washing her hands in between taking money and handling the food. It’s completely disgusting and unsafe.

<Review>Used to love coming here the waitress are rude!! They leave you on hold for ever and just hang up. Been calling for days they leave me on hold for over 10 min and never answer i end up hanging up and the line stays busy for over 30 min!! Ridiculous.. those waitress need a check. I dont usually leave bad reviews but this has happened over 10 times already no joke. Rather drive to montebello now< /Review>< pictures>

Food is great and reasonably priced. But the chef, manager, owner or whatever he is. Was not pleasant. I asked to substitute sashimi with another fish and he basically said take it or leave it.. So I left. Learn to treat your customers better. You may get more business.<//text>

<review>The food was good but the customer service not so friendly. Was not greeted, there is a sign that says wait to be seated . So I was waiting,then I got up and asked if we could just sit anywhere and the girl said she thought we were waiting for a phone order.

There's plenty of dishes one is able to try and they're economical. Overall, the quality of food is actually satisfying and healthy (varies on what you're ordering). Generally, one of my personal dishes is the Tofu Tempura with Salad and Rice, given the fact that tofu is relatively light in contrast to non-Vegetarian meals. The rice is suitable for keeping one's stomach satisfied for a few hours. The employees are helpful and recommend certain items, if you're not familiar. Usually, I dine in with my sister and mother at least once a month, but it's all worthwhile to enjoy great food and their company.< /text>

<Review>Ordered over the phone for pick up ( .9 miles from home) some veggie and avocado rolls. Rolls were extremely warm. Veggie rolls had funny taste. Expensive for poor quality.

Great Sushi place if you are a sushi lover. Recommend the Baked Lobster and the tempura rolls. You can sit there and eat some sushi but its a small area but shouldn't be a problem its so good and relaxing. Employees there are kind.< /review>

You all better hang on tight because this restaurant taking your taste buds to whole new heights and a whole new world, their foods all cook to perfection, especially their tasty udon soups and their sushi is the best than other Japanese restaurants in other places and they and would like you to help because if they close down, they won't be able to help children in need because lately people and children are seen out on streets and living under bridges in cities so everyone out there come help work and eats at the greatest restaurant in Downey Arigato and they also do delivery and party platters and they can be delivered for any party and their is beyond amazing<//Text>

The phone never works from 11.20am to 1.pm
Really unprofessional they unhook the phone and say it doesn't work I've been coming here for over 2 years and they still don't get their stuff together< /text>

<Review>Ordered a crispy tofu salad, and the server did not let me finish saying my order before she interrupted and asked another question. I tried to confirm with her and she did the same thing, saying "Uh huh, the crispy salad, I got it..." The order came, and it looked completely different than usual and I tried to confirm one last time, and she did the exact same thing cutting me off before I could say tofu. Didn't feel right, started to feel sick while I was eating it, and the texture was completely off. Started feeling nauseous by the time I finished eating. Got the receipt back, and it had an order for crispy albacore salad. Lifelong vegetarian, so my stomach is rejecting it. Not impressed. I know other people that would be happy to sue over something like that. Better train your people to listen carefully when a client is ordering, and not assume you know what they are going to say, ESPECIALLY if they take the time to confirm that you heard what they said. You're lucky it wasn't shell-fish and me with a shell-fish allergy.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Review>I love everything about this sushi spot except for one employee (girl/woman). She is always rude and interrupts when your ordering (over the phone, and she doesn't even answer the phone right, and sound as if it's her house and doesn't want to be bothered) and when I get there and re say my order she says yes everything is there and something is always missing. Everyone else is always great.</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>My Father and I decided to go to Samurai Sushi after months of not being there the day we arrived was 3/22/19 and we ordered 4 sushi rolls. However we only received one of our sushi rolls and our waiter made a list of our order on her phone,my Father and I were waiting for about 15mins and we haven't received anything else besides one roll. This was a huge disappointment to me since my father and I usually est the sushi here all the time but now you can tell the service isn't the same</Review><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

He helped answer all of my questions and got me in the store the same day. When I got to the store he was assisting another customer so James and Zach helped activate my new line. Not only were they knowledgeable and articulate but helped me through the whole set up process and getting my number transferred to Verizon.

Highly recommend this store for the employees and excellent customer service.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

< review>
I was using T-Mobile before and chose Verizon because of the better coverage. BAD CHOICE!!! The coverage can be better but the COSTUMER SUPPORT IS THE WORST! I went to this store with my husband and he got an new iPhone 11.. Calvin did the sale. But the problem is that when I got my first bill, I realized that Calvin selected the most expensive plan for us, and we didn’t want that! We wanted the intermediate one, and he also included the protection that I’m sure I didn’t ask him to included that! I called the costumer service and nobody helped me. The woman was rude. I ended up going to the store again, because nobody can help through the phone. And ALSO, he didn’t tell us that the credit we got from the treading phone is only supposed to be used after the 3rd bill. So many important information the salesman didn’t give to us. I was planning to save money changing the carrier but that is not going to happen. Worst experience ever! They just want to do the “sales” (that was what the Verizon employee told me in the phone). Awful!</review>

<Text>This is a great location. The staff is very friendly. They are generally willing to help customers out with everything. Parking lot is always empty so the is plenty of room to park.

When you enter the location, do make sure that you check in with one of the staff members. Once checked in you could browse around the store and find whatever you are looking for.</Text>< Pictures>

Great service, they helped me figure out the problem with my phone within 5 min of me walking in the door. I never felt pressured into purchasing anything or upgrading my current phone/plan, Their focus was on getting me fixed and back to work. I highly recommend this store. FYI, always get insurance.<//review>

<Resp>None</Resp><Text>I visited the store to pay my bill the moment I opened the door I saw three customer service persons standing at the desk and talking each other no one paid attention to me until I walked towards them , One customer service person ANDREW Attended me to pay my bill and since the conversation started he behaved very rude ,arrogant , discriminating I’m so surprised with his behavior thinking what I’m i done wrong !!! Later I asked him few questions regarding my bill and he answered with no interest and when I couldn’t understand and asked him again then he became so impatient towards me to find out more of his behavior towards me I asked him For the customer restroom and he replied back me saying “This is not a restaurant” is this the diplomatic way to speak with a customer??? Doesn’t a educated customer know wheather he walked in to a mobile store or a restaurant???After all the company is number one in USA I couldn’t be such huge without customers blessings but this type of customer service persons really damage the reputation of the company by humiliating the customer . I hope this should be considered under primary customer assistance support and proper action to be taken for not humiliate other Asian customers.<//Text><user>110519325851039237655</user>< rating>

Saturday afternoon, walk in and have to wait for a free associate to help me. Only needed to pay my wireless bill. Couldn't use the kiosk as I don't recall my 4 digit code. But the associate was still happy to help with paying my bill.< /Review>

Had to visit the store as my girlfriend's phone got lost and she wanted a replacement. Staff were polite and very helpful and we were on our way in 30 minutes (2 people were ahead of us). If you have a longer wait, there are several food and drink options right next door.</Text>

One of the better Cellphone stores I have been too. Christain was very helpful to help me get a new phone (Pixel :)) and a new connection. Definitely recommend checking this Verizon store before going to others.</Review>

There are other Verizon stores closer to my home. I always go to this one (and send my family here too). I have always had excellent, and very helpful, service at this store.</Review>

<review>I was having trouble with the speaker on my phone & the screen on my husband's phone (purchased less than 30 days before) had become cloudy. The cust. rep was very friendly online, but said we'd get faster replacements@ a verizon store.  We waited about 25 minutes, were dis(missed)ed very impatiently with "Oh, those are low-end phones." in a very snotty voice.  And then they turned to help the next customers.  So make sure you've got a top of the line Droid or blackberry-or you're wasting your time time!</review><time>1284701613357< /time>< userid>

Just tried to buy a samsung S2 tablet from this store. The sales person tried to tell me that all tablets are the same and was trying to push me towards the ASUS for $149.00. When i called him on it he got nasty and told me to buy it from best buy. Claimed he could not match bestbuys price so i called another store on el camino and he was eager to price match the tablet for me. 12-3-2016

I used to love this place but apparently Verizon cannot keep the store staffed with the same people. Apparently there is nothing but lazy arrogant waste of space sales people that work here now. I advise you to stay away from this store.<//text>

<text>Madison who provided the maintenance of our furnaces is definitely the right person to represent Cool Air Solutions. Not only he’s very knowledgeable with his trade but is willing to go the extra mile to provide good service. He doesn’t do short cuts. If he thinks there might be something going on with a component that he can’t visibly access or see, he’ll ask permission first to pull it out and test it in front of you. In our case, it’s the heat exchanger that happened to show some pinhole cracks. At the end, he explained everything he found with our furncaces that could be of concern and presented options for us. Very professional. Enjoyed interacting with him throughout the appointment.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

The installation of our entire HVAC system was done flawlessly. He made sure everything around his work area was canvassed off if there were any debris.  He supervised and communicated with his fellow worker, Angel, very well.  There was a very good communication between himself and us with the entire install. During this time of Covid-19, Nathan and Angel were completely compliant with the safety guidelines.  I wish to commend them and the company, Cool Air Solutions for their work ethics and practice. Would recommend this company !</Review>< pics>

Our AC went out in San Diego during a heatwave. Called  on a Friday night at 7pm, got an appointment Saturday 2pm-4pm. The phone staff were great. Michael showed up early at 1:30pm, which was awesome. He was quick to diagnose, and luckily it was an easy fix. He spent time explaining to me what happened and took photos. Then did it again when my husband got home. He included the photos on his invoice which he emailed me.<//Review>

Everyone I spoke with was polite and courteous, and We got an appointment in two days, which was great! Luis was kind enough to call when he was about an hour away, and arrived just when he said he would. He was friendly, walked me though the process, and was happy to answer all of my questions. This was a great experience, and we will call them for all HVAC needs going forward. Thanks!< /review>< pictures>

< Review>
Cool air solutions has been great from start to finish.  Jay came out to give us information and a quote.  He recommended a few options beyond what other companies were quoting us.  We felt confident in his recommendations and decided a conversion from 2 units to 1 larger more efficient system was the way to go.  Miguel and his crew came a few days later for the removal of the old system and install of the new system.  They were so careful not to damage the walls or staircase.  Covered the carpet and cleaned up the debri that came down from the attic.  The new system is amazing.  It’s so quiet and the airflow is perfectly consistent.   Our energy usage is down to a reasonable and affordable level now.  We definitely appreciate Jays recommendation on a variable one unit system.  And we definitely appreciated Miguel and his crews expertise in installing the system.  Also a note, during covid times, everyone wear a mask while in our home.  Even when it was 100 degrees and they were hauling huge pieces of equipment in and out, the crew never took down their masks.<//Review>

<Text>Our technician was on time, was pleasant, and was meticulous by wearing a mask and booties.  He showed us pictures of our heating units as we didn't go up in the attic area of the house.  This was tremendously helpful!  Repairs were done in a timely manner and so far, the heating systems are running again.</Text>< Pictures>

Scheduling was effortless and flexible with 2-hour windows, Tyler called ahead to provide an ETA and arrived on time and within window. Problem was diagnosed quickly, he explained and demonstrated the issue and recommended repairs. Expectations were managed with regards to followup visit scheduling, but fortunately the part arrived overnight and repairs were completed fast and easy. Total time without AC was less than 24 hours.</text>

<Review>Of course my AC broke during record breaking heat! I called on Saturday afternoon and someone was here Monday morning at 8am. Jimmy was comprehensive in his diagnosis and repairs. Our old heat pump was just serviced a month ago by another company who did not catch any of the problems Jimmy did. He was knowledgeable and explained everything he did to me. I appreciated the three repair options. Jimmy is GREAT, the business is lucky to have him.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

Luis came out to repair my AC.  The first time the repair didn't work, but, I'm glad he came back at no charge to fix it again.   It's now been three days of 105 degree heat and we're sitting cool with perfect AC.

Again, thank you Luis!  I know this wasn't an easy repair, but, I'm so glad you did just replace parts and rack up the price.  You tried a couple of different things to save me money in the long run.

I'm a happy repeat customer.<//Review>

<username>A George</username><time>1598584827101</time><rating>5</rating><Review>Cool Air Solutions Heating and Air Conditioning performed professionally from the beginning to end.  The appointment was set one week out from the initial phone call, understandable since it was the middle of a heat wave and their schedule was backed up a bit.  I received a confirmation phone call the day before and another 30 minutes out from arrival.  During the installation Luis Mendez (HVAC tech.) kept me informed of what was going to be performed during the AC repair.  Luis also informed me of what part of the AC might need to be replaced in the near future due to its age.  He was very thorough in his work and made sure he cleaned the area where the service was performed.  Over all the experience with Luis Mendez and Cool Air Solutions was great.  It was obvious Luis takes pride in his work.  I would use this company again and recommend them to anyone in need of AC repair.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>Detailed oriented, keen in all aspects, Jorge C inspected all components of my AC system, I had concerns about the age and status of my system so I requested an AC maintenance request. While he answered all my questions, I did not feel he was pushing a sale, he mentioned that Cool Air Solutions offers the options to keep or replace my system. Jorge answered questions about filters, the different components, even about how old refrigerant, not available in California, impacts our environment. Based on his answers, I could tell Jorge keeps updating his knowledge. I was in good hands. Thank you so much.<//review><response>None<//response></record>

His demeanor and confidence was that of a veteran tradesman. He was friendly, professional, and explained every step of the process.

<Date>1596754281671</Date><Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I was impressed with both Nathan and his assistant. I have a heat pump system with two separate units. They arrived promptly and started on the exchanger first. It was a challenge as the unit is located in a crawlspace in the master bedroom closet. Foe a moment I thought they would not be able to fit the unit in there but they managed to figure out a way :) I was nervous when he did cut into a live wire removing the old exchanger but he did say that was OK. The other parts of the install went much more smoothly.  The crane did not take long to bring the new condenser to the roof and haul away the old condenser. Nathan installed and programmed the thermostat and offered to show me how to use it but I had already set it up on my end. Cleanup was efficient and he offered to help put all the stuff back into the closet. In summary I would say that must have been a challenging job because of the cramped quarters but they both worked well and did a fantastic job!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80dc742260a3a775:0x4f10284538583a5e</gmapID></record>

My experience with Cool Air Solutions was great. They replaced our whole AC and furnace system. Started at Lowe's where they set up an appointment. Then Jordan Pierce came out and set us up with exactly what we needed at a great price. Nathan Gentry (our installer) was always on time, cleaned up any mess he made and answered all of our questions.< /review>

<Review>The Company always presents itself well. Makes appointments, shows up on time, in marked vehicles, and the techs always seem knowledgeable, respectful of my home (with things like booties on their shoes inside), and now respectful of the pandemic with the office first requesting information whether everyone at the house is well, and then the tech wearing a mask when he arrived. Jimmy was the epitome of all of that.</Review>< Name>

Jorge was unfortunately late due to prior appointments. The home base kept me updated and so did Jorge, which I really appreciated. When he got here, he was professional and wore a mask and shoe protectors. He was friendly and explained everything in detail that he did. I do not know anything about AC and he made it very easy to understand. Overall, a great experience<//review>

New A/c and furnace installed three months ago -- and the first time I tried using the furnace-- it would not work. Called and left a message with their office at night-- and I got a call by 8 am the next morning and they had a service tech at my home the next day. Problem turned out to be the computer board-- they are ordering a new one and will replace it within a few days-- free as it is under their one year warranty--Stuff happens with new equipment-- but they responded quickly and did their best to get my furnace fixed as soon as possible-- Iwould use them again--<//text>

Jimmy also explained next steps for maintenance and the possibility of having to purchase a new system due to age and previous owner's lack of proper upkeep.

<text>Luis was thorough and very instructive with his explanations after completing the service on two air conditioning units. After 20 years, our fingers were crossed for a few more seasons of operation. With his help we can achieve that, however he did discuss options with us should one or both units eventually fail. We feel ahead of the curve for now. And we feel most confident in recommending this company to our friends and neighbors.</text>< Pictures>

Luis Mendez,  takes 5 Star ratings to a whole new level! He's not only honest, professional , as well as knowledgeable but, he takes his craft to heart! He tells you exactly what is best for you, without thinking of the $$$ profit for his company! This day and age that is RARE! Thank you for taking the time to explain the process as well as the benefits, on how a new system will benefit our family.

<text>They kept their repair appointment within the 2 hour window they promised.  The technician was very professional and explained everything he was doing.  He did a thorough diagnosis, isolated the problems, and fixed them.  He also scheduled another appointment to review options for replacing my equipment, as I had indicated a willingness to do that.

We had to push out our appointment for a convenient time for both my boyfriend and I to be home. We wanted to ask questions about possible getting a whole new system. George was our service guy. He called 30 minutes into our appointment time to let us know he would be arriving shortly. He was very friendly and professional. After talking to him and giving him a little more history on our current system we decided to not do the maintenance, but rather do a diagnostic service to see what repairs would be necessary. It was so nice having a service tech that was looking out for our best interest rather then trying to add on services that wouldn’t have helped us in the long run, but would added to their bottom line along the way. Honesty and integrity come to mind with not only George, but his master tech Darren that came to do a quality control check and to answer our questions on getting a whole new system. The level of service provided today was outstanding and my boyfriend and I both agreed these are the people we want to do business with and will share the great customer service we have received to any and all of our friends and family who may need heating and air services.
Thank you again George and Darren for your five star service. We can’t wait to do more business with you guys.< /review>

<Text>They insured that my hvac would be more efficient and reliable in both hot and cold weather.   They gave me options when my system began to lose efficiency.   And besides educating me about my system,  they were
thoughtful about following up to double check everything was perfect.   The picnic basket thank-you gift was a pleasant surprise.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80dc742260a3a775:0x4f10284538583a5e< /gmapID></record>

Travis and company did the installation and were 100% professional go getters. They arrived promptly, even earlier than anticipated and went straight to work with courteous manners and clear indications on what they were doing. Jimmy came out today to fix an issue with my furnace. Within minutes, he found the issue, addressed it and showed me a few places to look for troubleshooting. I even asked him about my fireplace, and he gave me great advice. Hands down, best guys I’ve had come to my home.<//Text>

Cool Air Solutions installed our HVAC systems a few years back and has maintained it ever since. The system drastically changed the comfort level of our home and our lives for the better. The company has a top-notch quality culture. Justin knows his stuff. We recommend both Cool Air Solutions to anyone in the Menifee area looking to upgrade or repair their air conditioning system.< /text>

Charged me way too much money for a fan, replaced it and left my house, even though my a/c still isn't cooling. I asked him if he would make sure that was the issue before he left, he said yes, but nope. He just took the money and off he went even though my a/c isn't working.< /Review>

<review>They are very professional. The installer was very friendly. The work this company does is quality. They don't cut corners. The one and only thing. Which isn't a big deal but is something that I always do when I'm working in someone's home. If I move a around the customers things. To access what I'm working on. I always put thing back and sweap and clean up what ever kind of mess I made. That's the only sort of complaint I had. Other then that they did a wonderful job.< /review>< pictures>

Technician was very knowledgeable and professional. Found a major problem I was unaware of with my system that could have cost me thousands of dollars in water damage and repairs if he did not go above and beyond what he was here for that day.  After explaining the situation and almost certain outcome if the repairs were not done, we were able to come to an agreement on how to get it fixed.< /Review>

I am A First American Warranty client. Cool Air after letting me hang for a day , and I had to call them finally said they don't like the parking challenges at my home and won't come.

Darren Faught clearly explained the various HVAC units he sells to replace the old one in my house. He helped order it and set up financing. The entire conversation and sale was completed over the phone, remotely and easily. Thank you Darren.< /Text>

<user_name>Larry Hendricks< /user_name><Text>We wanted to thank Jay and everyone at Cool Air Solutions for a quality job replacing our home's HVAC system.  From the initial phone call to the final installation, everyone at Cool Air Solutions were very professional, responsive and understanding to our needs.  They went above and beyond in working with us and finding the right system for our home without needlessly installing equipment that we didn't need.  Our 2-in-1 system is exactly what we were looking for and were able to purchase a 22 SEER system with purification / UV filter for much less than we were quoted from other companies.  The entire installation crew and Jorge were a pleasure to work with and very professional.  We would HIGHLY recommend Cool Air Solutions to anyone looking to replacing their entire HVAC system.  Thank you Cool Air Solutions!<//Text>< Date>

Only reason we didn’t use Cool Air Solutions today, is because we are checking to see if we will be reimbursed by warranty company. I’ve used this company in the past and will use gain!< /text>

<text>Another company told me that I needed to replace my air conditioner and heater for a cost of over $12,000. All my AC unit needed was a good cleaning. I can't tell you how grateful I am. I'm an older woman and the 1st company must have seen me coming! That's disgraceful. I can't recommend Cool Air solutions more!<//text><gmapID>0x80dc742260a3a775:0x4f10284538583a5e</gmapID><user_name>Terry Quinn<//user_name>< Pictures>

Thank you for dispatching your very best service technician, Tyler Holmquist, for my certified Lennox service.  This visit was Cool Air Solutions first time here and as the saying goes...”you don't get a second chance to make a first impression” never seemed truer in practice.  Tyler sent an email in advance as an introduction with photo including training & certifications as well as his brief bio.  This simple action told me how well he and the company seek to set things up for success and follow-through by notifying me with a pre arrival phone call providing one hour lead time, thanks!  Tyler was punctual and presented himself wearing a clean uniform along with Covid 19 mask and gloves in addition to routine shoe coverings.  I found Tyler to be a very conscientious, confident and well-trained professional.  He presents himself and the company with a comfortable, relaxed disposition who has developed communication skills rarely seen in the HVAC industry as his amicable personality serves him extremely well.  Tyler demonstrated how much he enjoys his work and truly cares about giving himself completely to his commitment in providing service excellence.  Cool Air Solutions is in very capable, talented hands thanks to Tyler.  I feel my investment in the top of the line Lennox residential HVAC system (with 26 SEER) will last beyond the standard service life that Lennox products are engineered and known for, along with homeowner peace of mind.  Keep up the great work and stay the course towards higher achievements and customer satisfaction.< /text>

Our technician was very kind and courteous and used shoe covers to keep our indoors free of mud.  He explained the entire process and let me know all of my options.  I never felt pressured to buy more services which is a key for me.  I will always go back to a company who is honest and pressure-free.< /Review>

< Review>
We use Cool air Solutions on their monthly   maintenance plan. We find their sales team and technicians respectful, knowledgeable, and professional. They’re pricing is fair. They never try to sell me something I don’t need.</Review>

OUTSTANDING STAFF and wonderful service.  Every year they handle my income tax filing and their knowledge always impresses me.  They've got state-of-the-art tax software and can e-file to expedite the process.  Digital copies for me and willing to accept my forms electronically; just an AWESOME BUSINESS MODEL and great value for everyone.  Strongly recommend!<//Review>

I've done my taxes with Arleta Income Tax since I was 17 I'm now 55. They have always treated my taxes very professionally and proficiently weather it was a simple return or one with several real estate properties in multiple states. Thank your very much for your attention to detail and for still treating  me as if I were the only one you were taking care of.< /Text>

<text>I've been doing my taxes here for a few years now and so has my husband and his family before I even started dating him. Very friendly and professional staff. I ALWAYS wait til the last week, when I'm sure they're at their busiest but they get them done expeditiously.. I've even been audited (not bcuz of their info) and they were GREAT at helping me supply all the info the IRS needed. My sons have even started to use them!! I would DEFINITELY recommend everyone to use Arleta Income Tax, both for their expertise and their FAIR price, everyone in there has a good attitude which is a bonus.. I now live an hour away and will still be coming to do my taxes here</text><Rate>5</Rate><UserId.>112474204477788325335</UserId.><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

Will not come back, drove for 25 min here because saw positive reviews. I've order 2 californian classic from many different CarlJrs. This place made me regret my order. The burgers looked like they were sloppy made. Had to open one up to make sure it was my order. One had tomatoes top with green part. There was also slight wet rag taste. Clearly no quality control.<//Text>

Waited several minutes to even be acknowledged, paid $32 for poorly made food with hard buns. Cashier never smiled. Waste of money! Overall experience HORRIBLE.<//Text>

This is my favorite location out of all Carl’s Jr.’s in town. Very reliable. They are never with an attitude. Very polite. Order accuracy is on point. I never go to any other locations, even if closer to me. I love you guys. Thank you!<//review>

<Review>I didn't get my monster thick burger I ordered. when I told them they made a mistake; they accused me of lying and reluctantly made me another burger. Just to make the worng burger again! So I got snubbed 8 dollars and a whole lot of attitude. Damn near told the entire store before they made the burger too.</Review><UserId.>100874387232779812721</UserId.><pictures>None<//pictures><name>alex lopez<//name><Response>None<//Response>< Rating>

Milkshake was extra small and melted, like drinking milk. Whipped cream was warm. Western bacon cheeseburger had no onion rings no bbq sauce just a cheeseburger. Plain. Chicken sandwich was asked for just meat and cheese but it had all kinds of stuff on it. Totally backwards. The soda was supposed to be strawberry but it was orange. There was not one thing right on this order. Why the **** are you even open if its just a joke to you? This was clearly done on purpose and I've personally fired people for less.< /review>< pictures>

Outstanding place for quality cheap food. Visited on a Wednesday I think. The service was very sociable and kind. The bill was good for how much you get. Food and feeling reminds me of Kansas City.< /text>

<Review>$11.00 is to steep for a burger especially with the corona virus rules. My burger that I did purchase was barely above room temperature.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Rating>2</Rating><Text>Food was not prepared well. Had my favorite Double western bacon cheesburger meal but breading on onion rings was stale and over fried. Bacon had consistency of being over microwaved and burger patty was very greasy which is not normally the case. Was here in late hours, after midnight but not an excuse.</Text>< pics>

Drive through fast food should be just that. If you have to take a number and pull to the front of the store, you are no longer fast food.</Text>

<text>Two times I have been given the wrong order. How does someone get Guacamole and Bacon confused with Jalapenos. Not to mention one of their employees refused to take responsibility for the mistake, (even though she, Sherri[Sherry?] claimed to have quality checked it.) and was very rude. Would NOT recommend that anyone eat there if that's the service they offer.< /text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80945fc41cefe391:0xfe92968eb0762a65<//GmapID></record>

WARNING: if you eat here at night or early in the morning, you will most likely get food poisoning! I came to this location 4 different times, tried different burgers hoping to get a good one...seriously I tried. The older latina manager and her employee's dont care about the food quality. The burgers I got were colder than my drink. If this is a franchise owned location the owner needs to sell to someone better and the employees need to be arrested for contributing to food illness. If fresno sent an undercover health inspector this place would be permanently closed and should. All the 4 and 5 star reviews for this location are fake because if you go at night or in the morning you will see what I'm talking about. Spend your money at the Carl's jr on Shaw Ave off the 99. Its way better and the food is hot to the touch from the bag. Please please be careful buying food from here.<//review>

If you are homeless OR even just a tad bit dirty 😂bc of a long hard days work, don't eat inside here or even enter the front door  You will be asked at a " not an inside voice or tone " to leave or even better, told that you don't belong here. You know that life is hard enough and I know that everyone's story is different. Different places, situations, characters, even weather is a different thing for each AND all at any given time. But Carl's Jr, wow, they're something serious and they all need not only a good" life lesson" but some true top of the shelf customer service lessons.< /Text>

This location is my absolute favorite. The employees though ever changing are the friendliest people I've encountered at fast food restaurants. They greet you nicely and answer questions about their menu xleary with good knowledge of what they are selling. Will chose this location over any other one. The food is ok<//review>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>First time there, was double charged for my meal. Ended up paying $21 for a freaking burger. Employee ran my card twice saying the pressed cash instead of debit. Went the next day to show them my transaction and bank statements on my phone, management told me it was the banks fault. Yeah, it was the banks fault they ran my card twice. Never going there again and don't recommend it either.< /Text>< pictures>

I thought I'd try something new today. I stopped parked the car and went inside Carl's jr. . After waiting for 5 minutes, I got tired of standing there. I walked back out to my car, and went through the drive-thru. I didn't really want to because I was irritated already. But I figured I was there already, I just couldn't stand there any longer. I have a bad back. I ordered the four cheese quesadilla. It was very sad. The part that had cheese inside was fine, very mild, but nice and hot. The problem was that the cheese was just in the very center of the quesadilla with more than half of the tortilla uncovered buy any cheese or filling. Imagine half the tortilla just hot and dry and a little crispy. I was disappointed.< /review>

They take forever to get the order out especially when there's nobody in the lobby and all they care about is the drive-thru I think it should be equally the same<//Text>

I'm on the phone with the location shift manager trying to get a resolution for part of my order missing but was put on hold for 10 minutes now.
Just hung up on without even a good bye or anything.
I called back and they expect me to drive back to their location (21 miles away) to pick up what they shorted my order of, with no consideration offered for my major inconvience of having to drive back to their location to fix Their mistake.

Last time I will do any business with Carls Jr. anytime in the future.
Hope what you shorted my order of was actually worth loosing a customer over.
