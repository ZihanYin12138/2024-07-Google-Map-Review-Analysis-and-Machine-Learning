<text>Guy had told me that the screen for my phone would be ready at 4 pm. Dropped off my phone at around 11am, wasted the day waiting just for the lady to tell me that they did not have the part. If they would have told me that the part was not going to arrive today I would have taken it somewhere else. I recommend this place if you don’t want your phone fixed. Gave me a smug look and told me that the part that arrived was for another phone. Will never be coming here again nor do I recommend this spot.<//text>< UserId.>

The guy was great, and the prices are good,  you know how expensive it is just to get your phone fixed an iphone at that, but here it's not expensive and the job is better then paying what others are charging. I love it... Thanks and God bless.</Text>

< Review>
Best shop to fix your electronics at the best price !! Known the guy for a very long time he got unbeatable prices and fast too. Never had problems with him or service until recently with one cashier or repairer who failed to contact me back after leaving my device again after they had already “fixed it” for water damage but wouldn't turn back on after it died and were recharging me because supposedly the screen and LCD are not the same thing. But I would still recommend rather than going to the mall .</Review>

<Review>Robin did an amazing job on repairing my screen on my phone. The prices are reasonable/affordable. He changed my screen within 20 minutes! I also purchased a screen protector that he offered to put on for me. Most definitely would recommend him to friends and family. He was so helpful which I appreciate when getting services done. Will be going back to him for my future fixes on my phone.<//Review><GmapID>0x80c2b427fff7f025:0x2306edba4fca300c<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Came in for a new cell battery and they replaced mine with a used, faulty battery that not only drains faster than my old one, but the phone shuts off when it gets to 35% charge. Doesn't even say it's turning off, it's just dead.<//Review>

<review>Worst experience ever! Its the most unprofessional establishment I've ever been to.

I was trying to fix my phone and called on Monday to get the price and was told they don't have the parts for my phone and to come Wednesday. I went Wednesday and they told me they don't get their shipment til next Monday coming up. I even explain to them that I have a loaner phone and have to have it returned by next Friday. They reassured me the parts would be there on Monday when they get their shipment.

I called Monday just to make sure (thank god I did and didn't waste my gas) and when I asked the lady, she act like she didn't know what I was talking about when I mentioned shipment and told me to call back at 3pm. Didn't mention why or anything. Like just super disorganized. How do you work somewhere and know nothing? Definitely NOT RECCOMMENDING THEM TO ANYONE.</review>< Time>

< Review>
Brought my phone here, to have the screen fixed. After having God awful service here the first day, they repaired the screen. The next day I noticed, there were a million bubbles under the screen. Took the phone back 4 times, because the guy at the register kept assuring me they were waiting on a new machine. Two weeks later, while typing, my phone screen cracks again, and Im beyond pissed. The material used to replace the screen was beyond cheap. When I returned for them to repair the millions of bubbles, and the new crack, I was told they were going to try and repair the bubbles, but they cannot warranty their cheap glass replacement. When I asked why, he said they don't warranty the glass, even though it was obvious it was done poorly. I was initially going to leave my phone to fix the millions of bubbles, but he said the crack in the glass would get worse. I cannot fathom why the hell i would leave my phone, so it could be in worse condition when I get it returned to me. I referred my cousin here, because of their cheap prices, but she too has millions of bubbles under her screen. STAY CLEAR OF THIS PLACE!

********Update*********

Reluctantly, I went back here, at a friends request - this time things were better. They fixed my phone in the time frame they promised, so no complaints out of me this time. So, I had an awful experience, and a much better experience, hence the 3 stars.</Review>

<Review>When I presented my iPhone 8 for glass repair , I was asked if I wanted an original for 80 or a aftermarket for 50. I chose the original. Everything was OK until I realized that the camera was not working.  SInce I had warranty I took it to Apple for repair.  That’s when I found out that the screen that was supposed to be original was also aftermarket with a few apple parts on it.  Pls ease be aware.  This store does not have OEM apple parts. The Screen was did have apple Logos but was missing the Bar Code and had a drilled hole in the silver metal piece which is not on OEM parts.< /Review><username>jitendra dutt<//username><resp>None<//resp><user>102089702511776970075<//user><rating>1< /rating>< date>

<Text>Very bad costumer service, they falsely advertise their services and products. You go in with one problem and after they tell you it will be ready in 1 day that 1 day turns into a week. You go and try to inquire about the progress on the repair of your equipment and tell you to wait 5 mins that turn into 1 hr ..... And just to tell you that they fixed it that they plugged it to a power source and that it took the charge but disconnected it. So when I go back again to try to pick it to and leave the store to find out that it's not working .. And I am still waiting for my equipment . It was dropped off on Sat May 28 and today is June 7 th ...

So guys if you want good service don't come here ..!!!</Text>< username>

{'time': 1465313422381, 'text': "Its a samsung galaxy tablet model sm- t217.This tablet usually has charger port problems, we can repair it in 20 mins.We replace the port but the tablet still won't turn on, we have 80 to 120 customers at day and 2 technician witch we have a lot of traffic. When the tablet won't work in the first try, we usually do it later on that day when the shop closes the doors to the public that way we can focus on it better. To be honest i forgot it because the traffic of customers, after 2 days i tried replacing the port for the second time and charging the battery externally, and we could see it work. When you brought the tablet back we seen the tablet continue the same, i decided to replace the battery for the same $40.  The tablet still continues the same, so in fact the tablet is manufactured problem, but we do the job on time, even with the high traffic. Thanks reviewers, (Fast Cellular help wanted.)"}<//Response>

<review>THERE CROOKS!!!!!! STAY AWAY

where do I start a couple of years ago i took in my son's phone to get the screen fixed and when he picked it up he was told his camera will no longer work !!!!
we let it slide and he was like okay as long as my phone works, so 2 months went by and his phone stopped working  all together so when i took it in to t-mobile to get it exchanged under warranty, they informed me that the inside of the phone the phone had been switched out!!!!!!!
they STOLE the inside of the PHONE AND REPLACED IT WITH A UNLOCKED ONE!!!!  WHO FUCCIN DOES THAT TO A TEENAGER
I went in and told them what was going and all of a sudden they said they have "changed Ownership" and it was under new management and they couldn't do anything!!!!! i was pissed and was out of a phone.

so a couple of moths ago i took in a Samsung 7 to unlock and i figured i would give them a second chance WORST MISTAKE EVER 2 MONTHS LATER AGAIN MY SAMSUNG WONT TURN ON!!!!! I WILL NOT BE GOING BACK TO THIS PLACE PLEASE STAY AWAY PAY EXTRA IF YOU MUST TO GET THINGS DONE RIGHT!!!!

LIKE THE SAYING GOES YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!!!!!
BTW I COULDN'T GIVE IT ZERO STARS SO I HOPE PEOPLE READ THIS<//review>< userid>

I was on Vacation and came in to fast cellular to fix my daughter's iphone 6s, it was around 3 months old and her iphone still looked brand new. When i got in i saw a lot of people waiting,  and i though that the phone was going cost a lot to get it fixed but guess what, they told me, your phone is gonna be ready in 20 to 30 mins and that was exactly how long they took.
plus the price really reasonable. I high recommend this cellphone repair shop, thanks Fast cellular.</text>

<Text>Came here to changed a broken screen ona Samsung Galaxy s5. They changed the screen and I get it back, but now the screen won't rotate. It worked fine, I used it to set it on my dash sideways for the GPS.

Anyway I take it back to them and the rude guy working there gave me attitude. He said how can I prove that it worked before.

Screw this place. Never going back</Text>< Pictures>

They don't know what they are doing when it comes to iPhone 6 repair. First I took it to get my screen fixed because it was cracked. They fixed it in 30min. Later that day I had incoming calls. When I answered there was no sound from the person on the other line. They could hear me talk but I couldn't hear them at all. Went back and told them my problem and they fixed the issue in 5min. The next day while on Snapchat i tried to use my front camera to use the filter and my screen was all black. My back camera worked but not my front camera. Went back to confront the situation a second time. Then he said he will get it fixed. In 5min he came back out and everything was fine 🙄. Sike. That's what I thought. Now my screen has little blue dots everywhere and I'm not taking it there a third time. $80 dollars down the drain. IM DONE WITH THIS PLACE!! This was my first time coming here because it was recommended but EF THAT!! NEVER AGAIN!!! They don't even apologize  for making me come back twice for their mistakes. DO NOT COME TO THIS PLACE TO GET ANY IPHONES FIXED!!!! DONT SAY I DID NOT WARN YOU!!!<//review>

<Review>These guys have a very bad attitude, very bad customer service. I took my phone for a check up one day and they told me one price but i didn't fix it because I didn't enough money .....I came back 2 weeks later with the same phone and this time it was more expensive and the guy or the owner was very rude basically leaving me talking to myself and went back to his hole to work. With an attitude like he does not care for his customers. Bad Bad Bad.   Essa gente es muy abusiva y pedante no saber como hablar con un clients. Busquen otro lugar mejor.</Review>< pictures>

Feel confident on leaving your phone with these guys, they know what they are doing. I have been going to them for years< /review>

<text>I left my phone and they gave me a date to come. I return and still hadn't been worked on. Returned 2 days after the scheduled time and had to still wait an hour while they worked on it. They gave me a phone ccase for the wait and apologized so I was fine. They replaced my lcd screen and battery but a few days later my battery turned bunk. The phone earlier is mega hot and battery runs out after 20 min of phone use. 1 month later my main function button on the bottom of my galaxy s4 gets stuck down, I pushed on it  and the whole lcd screen shatters.  Never will return as they use cheap replacement parts.< /text><rate>1<//rate>< response>

< Review>
It really helps when an employee actually knows a store policy.  Sign on the door "Only two parties allowed in the store at one time".  We look in the store, one party of two people, we make the second party and walk in (we are not within 15 feet of anyone in the store and are wearing our masks)... lady behind the counter, You have to wait outside.  Ok, questioning the sign...  "Your sign says two parties, not two people."  Atempting to get a legitimate clarification.  Rudely, she responds...  "You have to wait outside, that is our store policy, if you do not like it, we do not need your business."   She was right, they did not need my business and we went to Doc Bernsteins (one block away).  I do not care if your policy is Two people in the store at one time, if that is what you want, that is fine...  but your sign should say that, not " Two parties", which many people will take to interpret as two groups of people together.  Simple fix, update your store sign to say "Two People".< /Review>

Well, I'm a bit of an ice cream connoisseur and trust me, the quality of the ice cream was awesome and the waffle cone was on point as well. We really enjoyed the server and she directed us to the best choices!! We had to wait a bit but great things are worth waiting for!! Would definitely visit here regularly if I lived in California...< /Review>

< Review>
The ice cream was really good, and the place looked really nice inside. It is kind if overpriced and has small portions unless you get a large waffle cone. The only thing I disliked about the place, was one of the employees was really weird. She didn't have much if a personality, and she wasn't very helpful. I would maybe come back for  the ice cream if a different employee was working and was nicer.<//Review>

Take your time and try all the different flavors and dairy-free sorbets. The staffis so nice and patient that they will let you try them all before choosing. Although a scoop is five bucks, the flavors are unique and impactful. It seems they draw inspiration from a variety of culinary backgrounds and they do a good job of representing those flavors. Definitely worth a try.<//Review>

Bought a pint of chocolate covered strawberry ice cream to enjoy this weekend. Long story short: It was freezer burned. It was grainy and icy, super disappointing because I heard such good things on this ice cream flavor. Not sure if I'll go back, a lot of money for freezer burned ice cream. Likely the ice cream that is bought by scoop is still good. So still get a scoop but maybe not a pint.< /Review>

Local review by a local:  Excellent locally made ice-cream that has great creative flavors.  They are doing a great job of being COVID-19 safe, and you order via a window in the door.  The only downsides are samples are not available so you could be stuck with something too sweet for example.  Since I am older, I tend to go with robust flavors with things like pie crust in them.  While I thought the Boysenberry was totally amazing in flavor and reminded me of the long defunct Ben & Jerry's version for decades ago, I could do without pie pieces. In keeping with simplicity, I also had a scoop of Vanilla Bean.  It was refreshing.  While they did have a single flavored Strawberry & a Complex Chocolate, I kind of missed a Coffee or a Pistachio.  There was an intriguing Lemon combo, but without sampling why risk it.  While I see the appeal for the Millennial crowd, us mature folk do enjoy the classics, so please make more of those.  IN any case, it made an excellent dessert after a big meal at Ox & Anchor around the block.  This local ice-cream was also available at the Avila Barn, where sundaes where available.  I am not sure if that is possible in the future here....I guess it depends upon this new C-19 age.  Regardless of the above, it is simply marvelous to see this wonderful venture surviving in downtown SLO, despite the many challenges. Thank you so much for all your hard work!</review>

<user>116976417488826345286< /user><Name>Max Goldberg< /Name><Date>1564871249832< /Date><Rate>5</Rate><review>So you know when people all tell you an ice cream place is amazing, and you get excited when you go, then as you're getting your first samples you worry if it's all hype? You've had some pretty amazing ice cream before. That first taste had better be pretty spectacular, right? So even if it's some of the best ice cream you've ever had, it's not going to blow you away, and if it's in any way mediocre, you'll be flat out disappointed. That's the headspace I was in as I was handed my first taste of McConnell's ice cream on a metal spoon. I took a bite and I suddenly had my perspective on the entire concept of ice cream shifted, because it is some of the best ice cream in some of the most insightful flavors you'll ever see. Every flavor is delicious, good luck picking one.

You want to know what kind of wizards these guys are? They made cornbread into an ice cream. And it's genuinely the best ice cream my wife and I have ever had. It's so good we're getting extra to go.

My only constructive criticism is that the waffle cone is not great. It tastes just like a regular cone. But with ice cream this good you won't care. They could charge 150% as much and it would still be worth it.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

They have some really good unique flavors. The prices are pretty high though, 6 dollars for the flight which is 3 very small scoops. The sizes are weird, and there's single 2 regular scoops and flight which is 3 half scoops and double which I had to ask and you can have 4 flavors. Doesn't make much sense.</text>

<review>The ice cream flavors at McConnell's are exceptional and well thought-out. I had grapefriut ice cream for the first time and it was surprisingly good. I shared it with someone who doesn't even like grapefruit and she asked for more!  And yet it really did taste like grapefruit!  They have the Midas touch.  The ice cream base itself is not as rich as some I've had, which is either a plus or a minus depending on your desired level if indulgence. The prices are more Big City than Small Town, so you're prepared. Enjoy!</review>< Pictures>

They always have a ton of different flavors to choose from and I never get the same thing twice. There's limited seating inside but it's in a great location in downtown SLO and we've always been able to grab a seat inside. The staff is friendly and always offering different options if you can't decide which flavor to choose from.< /Text>

Really good ice cream, though it's a bit pricey. During Covid, you can't go inside and peruse the selection as you order off a posted list on the window and get your order out on the sidewalk.</text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>Adding into the mix of ice cream places in SLO is McConnell's, a fine sweet delicacy from Santa Barbara. I was very surprised to see one here, but also very relieved that I don't have to drive all the way to Santa Barbara anymore. It kind of appeared out of thin air, but also just in time for finals week at Cal Poly. As ice cream prices go, it is $5.25 for two scoops (called a single scoop) and there are so many options! My favorite thing about them though are the dairy free flavors. Not many people go through the effort to make dairy free flavors and just resort to sorbets which is just sad. Overall, a great place to grab a snack or dessert after a meal!</text>< pictures>

{'time': 1562628665405, 'text': 'Hi Aida, so happy to hear that you enjoyed your ice cream!  I\'m sorry your waffle cone wasn\'t the texture you were hoping for or expecting.  We do make our waffle cones from scratch at all of our scoop shops.  Because we do hand make them, there will be some variation in the exact amount of "crunchiness," which doesn\'t necessarily mean the waffle cone isn\'t "fresh" if it\'s not crunchy - it could just be because it was cooked for slightly less time.  I would be happy to make this up to you if you\'d like to send me an email at info@mcconnells.com with your contact information.  Thanks for taking the time to give us your feedback.'}< /Response>

Have been getting my nails done at Davi Nails for years and during Covid and a recent move I was happy to return even though it takes me an hour plus to drive there now. Each specialist is wonderful. I have manicures, full set gel and pedicures. They also wax my eyebrows beautifully. All in all, a great Nail Salon.<//text>

I went yesterday for the first time, and the lady who did my padi was very nice but I was surprised she took less than 10 minutes to finish. I was unsatisfied, she didn't clean under the nails that good and she barely scrubbed my feet.<//Review>

Ask for John or Kim for full sets, you will not be disappointed. I get so many compliments and the prices are reasonably and competitive compared to other nail shops in the area.</Review>

<time>1570851592266<//time><Rating>1<//Rating><text>I like having my healthy natural nails just painted with regular nail polish. I have thick healthy natural nails.  For some reason, they overly thinned my nails with their machine. The next day 5 of my nails broke (two of them down the middle) it was extremely painful! I went back in to show them and one broke on my way into the salon,which was perfect proof. They had the nerve to still make jokes about it and laugh in my face and charge me even more than the first time. I’m honestly so upset and I never write reviews on anything but this was so wrong and they re used the brush they used on my bleeding nail! How gross! You guys, I used to love and rave about this place, but lately it’s been a mess. I have walked out with weak and crookedly shaped nails the past few times. Anyways, good luck to you.. this is the one in hesperia on main</text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Very poor customer service.  Nail tech never even introduced herself.  To busy watching the news and talking with other employees.  Nails look ok.  Could have looked nicer if attention was giving to her work rather the teying to watch the news while working on my nails.  Not recommended.< /review>

I had given up hope on finding a good nail technician in the area.  But I came across an Instagram post with JOHN from Davi Nails work and I was sold. My nails came out gorgeous. He was patient and creative. See my post on YELP also.<//review>

<Text>This is my go to Nail Salon! I love everything about it. They got me right in with little to no wait despite it being about 30 people there. It was so quick and the person who did my pedicure was so comforting and made sure I was comfortable the whole time. Would recommend! They'll have you looking swift on the rift!</Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<review>Horrible costumer service. Got a pedicure and  didn’t take my ingrown nails out when they I clearly asked them to. They gave me a five minute pedicure.  Also, they painted my nails and they painted them half ways.

They know how to upsell for Gel. If you cant paint a regular acrylic set than why would i let you do Gel. I saw the lotion but she didnt even bother to put it on or clean up the edges from the paint. Then the color was streaky and i told her it doesnt look right and she had thr audacity to say its bc i didnt get gel. Girl first time last time.</text>

The paint job is horrible, the acrylic on my nails looked absolutely horrendous the very next day. The acrylic around my cuticles was literally chipping off and looked dry and crusty within 24 hours. They kept trying to charge me different prices for a very basic 30 minute pedicure and a short set of acrylics. When I said I didn’t want gel they had an attitude. I can literally buy gel polish and a UV lamp at Salon Centric for way cheaper and do a gel manicure at home. They act like the gel polish they use is made out of gold (and wayyyyy over charge for it), when they probably get the cheapest brand off Amazon. Please don’t waste your money here.

***I am referring to the Davi Nails inside the Walmart located off Palmdale and 395.< /Text>

I recently moved to the high desert and been in search of a good nail shop. I went in on July 3, and got a complete package  along with my daughter. Deluxe pedicure and manicure..I end up spending more than 120 bucks there. I asked for heart designs for both me and my daughter. By the time we were done and  got home where I really  checked them out my heart looked like my 7 year old did them and the ones on my toes look like  blobs of white paint and two nails we messed up.  I was meaning to go back and have them fix  them but didn't have time until today.  The guy that help me wanted to  charge me $10.00 to redo my nails..I explained the situation and told them that I already spent a lot of money in there.  When the lady that did the hearts comes up to me and says that "he's being nice she would have charged me $20 to fix it." I honestly thought I had found  my new nail shop,  but they have really bad customer service when it come to pleasing the customer.<//Review>

<Review>I was back and forth because they are good for BASIC work, you have to ask for specific people to get the right nail work done, and it seems they always do a RUSHED JOB. Over charge for stupid things. The only thing over outstanding is their receptionist. 5 outta 10 I always have a problem with my nails being to thin , thick or just not what I like. I'm fed up.<//Review>< GmapID>

< review>
My sister in law recommended them, I was leary, because it's Walmart. I liked my pedicure, girl was friendly, and did a good job. But I got a full set with pink and white. Lady did an ok job, but what really ticked me off was the upcharging at the end! BEWARE!!! Prices are NOT what they advertise! Pink and white says $32 and up. I thought the "& up" was extras like jewels, glitter, etc. Nope, they charge you $8 for the clear coat that goes over your acrylics!!! I've NEVER had a salon charge for the clear coat! I won't be back again!< /review>

Looking at all the reviews from the other people here, I was alittle hesistant to make my way over and try for my self. I couldn't believe that was probably the best manicure I've ever gotten. To anyone who reads the reviews of this location, disregard the low star ones. I believe they are false reports from other local nail salons that are trying to deminish this location to steal and persue other customers from going to this location to their own. I rate this 5/5.<//Text>

<Text>I used to be regular here but the service here and the nails they do are horrible and they over charge you . I started to only go here to take off my nails but not anymore. They ripped my nails off, cutting me and not saying anything or apologizing. There also suppose to soak your nails in acetone. To remove them .< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

This place is the worst. The lady i had was rude for first thing in the morning.  I came to pick up a package that was supposed to be delivered on 3/1. I got a tracking update late last night saying it was available for pick up. No more tracking updates. Showed up to pick it up @930am and its out for delivery. Their teacking system didnt update. Picture added to show what is going on with my package.< /Review>

Feeling lonely during the pandemic and miss being around other people? Just go to this post office, where you get to spend a very long time standing in line crowded next to tons of people in a small space. A marvelous experience. Great workout for your feet too if you enjoy standing in the same spot endlessly.<//text>

This post office has the worst mail carriers ever.....on more than one occasion the carrier noted my item(s) were "delivered" when, in fact these packages were NOT delivered. Am taking this criminal act to the next level!
Shouldn't even get 1 star!</review>

Although it was pretty packed today at the postal office, all the employees were friendly and were moving as fast as they could. So far no bad experience. Just remember it is a postal office so expect to wait for at least a while but they are doing the best they can.</Text>

I don't get my mail most the time and I get other people's mail. People have sent me cards and not got them. Seems like people steal in that post office or the carrier. Worst postal service. I don't even get ads anymore. Watch your mail.< /review>

i see all the review on here - some issues that can be resolved
everytime i go here its either a hit or miss of how long the line is
despite that theres always one lady - her customer service always brings somebodys day up - it can be a busy place at times - but dont ever doubt everybody that works there is kind and helpful</text>

First the lady flipped a  U in my housing track so fast, if there was a child she would have run them over, had blasted music and had an attitude beyond belief. I’m sorry your job is stressful but keep your problems to yourself and have respect. My child said she upset him  for how rude she spoke to me.

I came here while visiting. Our attendant was okay—he seemed to be multi tasking and not paying attention to the details of what we were doing, which was concerning because we were mailing a certified letter to the IRS. However, what stood out was the other attendant, Colleen. I don’t expect stellar customer service from the post office but she was extremely kind and helpful to the people coming up the counter. She didn’t seem jaded from dealing with people (who are likely older). Very sweet and patient—a breath of fresh air. It doesn’t go unnoticed.< /Text>

<Review>I’d give negative stars if I could! They rarely answer the phone when you call. They make a lot of mistakes like misdelivered mail to wrong address or leave key to lock box in wrong persons mailbox, or leave packages at the door and don’t even bother to ring your doorbell and when you complain they NEVER take responsibility which is the worst part! If you don’t like your job.. please do us all a favor and get a new one!</Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

I actually had a great experience last week at this location. Micheal was super helpful as well as the manager that was on duty. I frequent the post office in general but typically use the temecula location. This was probably my best experience with USPS. I know this one can get crowded but that is not the employee's fault so as long as they are helpful and have positive attitudes I'm a happy camper!< /Review>

<Review>Went there to ship something to Germany for my friend in the military and Colleen was such a huge help. I’ve never done it before, and she was really patient and helpful. There was a huge line and she treated me and everyone with such positivity and knowledge. It was truly a treat to be helped by her.< /Review>< Pictures>

I've been pleasantly surprised at each of my visits.  Even during the Christmas season, with long lines, it was made bearable by having one of the postal workers in the lobby helping direct customers to whichever window they should go to for their needs or helping customers with the self-service machine.  And at each of my visits every person I dealt with was cheerful and polite.  Very refreshing!
6/20/18. Have been to this post office twice in the past week and it is still one of the best places in town! It would be wonderful if the people that work here could give classes on good - no, great - customer service.</review><time>1529594098867</time>< Name>

If your lines are that busy maybe you need to invest in call waiting.  I received a notice that a small package was delivered to my mailbox, but it wasn't there.  I assume it was put in the wrong box.  Any help post office?<//text>< pictures>

You have to stand in line with 20 people just to get a application to change your address. Waisted time... please put out change of address package so we can just grab one.< /Review>

A very poorly run main post office, the state street one.   Always crowed, always slow.  Just plain bad.  It doesn't get any worst than this one.  It doesn't even deserve one star.   More like a minus 5 stars if it was possible to rate it that way.   Having been to a lot of main post offices in Southern CA, I would have to say that this one is the worst out of the lot.  Where is the oversight for this Post office???  It's run by incompetents and crooks.< /text>

I'm currently in the middle of moving. The woman would not accept 3 forms of identification for a PO Box prepaid for online, even with the ID's being current and listed as accept able on the request form. She told me to write a fake lease and use that instead as identification. Something shady about this location.< /text>

Apparently this Post Office does not answer their phone or perhaps they have nobody there to answer it.  It makes me wonder why they would even have a phone number listed with their online profile.

It also makes me wonder how a business can be so poorly run, even a government business, and still manage to function.  Disgusting service and lack of customer care.<//Review>

I know there is walk-in & appointments you can arrange. The passport agent you want to meet with is Claudia. She speaks both English & Spanish fluently. Some info you may find useful is to

1. Have your application filled out in advance with black ink only!
2. Have photo copies of your ID (front & back), & present your original birth certificate along with a copy of your birth certificate.
3. You can get a passport photo here! $15
4. The application process is 10-15 minutes top! (She's fast!)
5. You can get your money order with the passport agent with debit or cash.
6. If you have a renewal or recall having a passport years ago, you have to turn them in with your application.

I suggest walking in person to clarify any questions or even to make an appointment! She's there full-time for passport services only. Also there's a Facebook page with helpful info about the passport applications/prices if you search under "Hemet USPS Passports"

The passport agent does have weekly rotating days off so that’s why it’s helpful to schedule an appointment in advance.

The passport hours of operation are Monday-Friday from 9:30am-12:30pm & Saturday appointments only from 6am-9:45am & then walk-ins from 10:00am-12:30pm.

Satisfied service!</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80db6f4491d178a1:0x6a547223659d2cdf< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Six days ago a package from Amazon was reported, by the Post Office itself, as being out for delivery.  It never showed up, nor has been the shipping information been updated so far.  And today, the carrier marked a delivery as "Undeliverable as Addressed".  I get packages on almost a daily basis!  Tomorrow I will go to the Post Office and demand to see the Post Master and see what he/she plans on doing about the employee or employees involved.  I am retired, and I will NOT let this continue.  I've got nothing but time on my hand to make complaints...all the way up to the Postmaster General!<//text><gmap_id>0x80db6f4491d178a1:0x6a547223659d2cdf<//gmap_id><username>Dave Hutchinson</username><pictures>None</pictures>< Rating>

They make a big deal about free collection of packages if you schedule it with them.  THEY DON'T, it's hit and miss at best.  For the 4th time since Thanksgiving the mail man has failed to make the collection.  It's it about time they started culling the lazy good for nothing piles of fecal matter that they call postal workers and get people that can do a simple task that they are over paid for.   <DIAF><//Review>

<Review>My mail box was recently destroyed by vandals along with a lot of other mail boxes on my street. We had to order a replacement, made of steel this time so hopefully any future vandals will break their arm if they try to damage it. We recieved the mail box in less than a week and just needed to install it but in less than a week we already had a note taped to the empty post that we needed to replace our mail box ASAP and they would hold our mail until we did so... the mail man has no trouble bringing packages to our door (if it's the regular guy, his replacement when he is not working refuses to come to our door and leaves a note making us drive 30 minutes to go into town to go to the post office because we can never get anyone to answer the phone if we want to request them to bring it the next day. They won't make 2 attempts to deliver. We are always home btw and our driveway is less than a 1/2 mile which is their limit for acceptable delivery distance) but he can't deliver our mail to our door for 3-4 days while we get a replacement mail box? We were the victims of a crime. One that we can do nothing about. No cop will take it seriously and even though it's a federal crime no one will put real effort into finding out who did this to me an my neighbors. It cost us $100 to get a new mail box! So, instead of consideration, empathy, sympathy for that, they hold our mail and leave a mean note. On top of that the last 4 packages we have received have all had damaged boxes like someone was trying to open them and see what they were. Not happy at all. I also have to call now because my tracked shipping says I received a package yesterday and I didn't. So now I have to figure out if they are still keeping my mail or if they left it at the wrong house. Hopefully they answer the phone since I NEVER drive to Hemet for anything except this. I live closer to Temecula but my assigned post office is Hemet. Waste of time, energy and gas.

I will say that when I actually go in, all the workers inside the office have been nice, polite, helpful and try to be as efficient as possible.

Not the guy on the phone though. Not once has he apologized or said he would talk with the employee who won't come to my door. Our regular mail guy has apologized for his replacement and says he tells the guy to come to our door but if the manager doesn't care and isn't going to back up his employees what use is he?</Review>< user_id>

<pictures>None<//pictures><text>This is not the postal service fault in anyway, But something needs to be done! Waiting in line to collect your mail for an hour is very aggravating. Not knowing what has been stolen is not right and having to tell your kids that grandma's card with their gift card was stolen by scum is heart breaking.  I live over by West Valley High, Our Mailbox was broken into a around 10 days ago, took over a week to get fixed. I came home tonight to see the door the just repaired a day ago pried open again. This time it is damaged so bad I think it is UN-reparable. This ridiculous! Crime in this area is getting out of control. They have broken into every mailbox in the neighborhood. This is a federal crime and these people responsible need to be caught and punished as an example to all the other scum that has moved in here over the last 2 years.< /text>< user_name>

For the second time, in one week, I have  received notice that a package was delivered to my mail box.  Ha!  For the second time in one week I’ve not found a package in my box.  The first one finally showed up three days later.  Which was the same day that the replacement shipment arrived.  I’ve lost confidence in this form of delivery.  If they’re not going to put it my box, they shouldn’t scan it and notify me that they completed their job.</text>

<UserId.>105480873402307544298</UserId.><date>1412113307674<//date><Review>Mail carrier Larry took two outgoing priority packages from me and because he was distracted, did not scan them and now both packages have completely disappeared.  Post office will not look into this for 30 days from date of pick-up.
The two customers will be refunded their money from my account long before that with me being out $269.  there is NO other business that has such a "I don't care" attitude more than the post office.  I spoke to both Nick and Jose on the phone who said they'd look into it, but I was also told the packages were not sitting on a truck nor were they in the post office somewhere.
SO WHERE ARE THEY?
With the 2-day priority mail labels on both, even not being scanned should have arrived at their destination long ago.< /Review>< Rating>

<Text>I get my neighbors mail several times a month. I get my mail every other day. I get mail for an address with a similar number address but totally different street name and 2 miles away from me. Lance in the post office is condicending and rude ALL the time. Why are they losing money?. Laziness, rudeness, and incompetence.< /Text>< pics>

This is the WORST USPS EVER! Packages aren't delivered on time, stolen, misplaced, you name it! Customer service is seriously lacking! No one knows anything about services or polices...it's really quite tragic! Management is whoever you speak to on the phone therefore there is NO resolution to anything!</Text>

<name>Rose Renee</name><Resp>None</Resp><Review>Mail carrier Larry took two outgoing priority packages from me and because he was distracted, did not scan them and now both packages have completely disappeared.  Post office will not look into this for 30 days from date of pick-up.
The two customers will be refunded their money from my account long before that with me being out $269.  there is NO other business that has such a "I don't care" attitude more than the post office.  I spoke to both Nick and Jose on the phone who said they'd look into it, but I was also told the packages were not sitting on a truck nor were they in the post office somewhere.

People work and bring mail after work. I don't doubt that mail clerks want to go home, but some could certainly come in later than others and serve people until 6 PM.

Yes, the post office is going bankrupt and they way they treat customers is the reason.<//Review>< pics>

I have never been more dissatisfied in a business, let alone a postal office in my entire life. The Hemet Postal Office never take responsibility for their lack of organization, they mis-deliver stuff all the time (I am not being dramatic either), I sent out an application for something (within my state) and 2 weeks later I received it back stating that it needed more postage (according to the manager it was MY fault for not sending my application certified mail), I avoid the USPS like the plague and when I am forced to use them I am outraged every time. The lack of accountability in the Hemet Office is disgraceful and they should be ashamed!< /Text>

Misdelivered packages. In the past week I've had 2 misdelivered packages. I probably have at least 8 that were delivered to the wrong address in the past year. The carrier keeps delivering to the wrong house. Lucky the neighbor on the next block was kind enough to deliver my packages.

update 07/27/2016
09:30 - I tried calling the Hemet PO to report the problem and they did not answer the phone.
12:00 - Latest package was misdelivered to another house and was delivered to me today.< /Text>

Today November 18th 2016,ailman never delivered mail to our home adress. We had a letter in our mailbox with red flag up for mailman to take letter, if mailman did come by ( which I doubthe did) he never took outgoing letter. Plus he keeps leaving mail in our box for people that dont live at our address.<//text>

<text>I HAVE A SMALL BUSINESS IN HEMET, AND I HAVE BEEN RECEIVING MY PACKAGES VERY LATE, OR THEY DONT KNOW WHERE IS A PACKAGE WHEN IT HAS BEEN SERVED FIRST BY UPS TO BE DELIVERED FOR USPS. THIS IS A RIDICULOUS SERVICE. I WISH I CAN STOP USING THIS USPS SERVICE, BUT SOME SELLERS DONT HAVE OTHER CARRIER PROVIDER.
I ORDER A PACKAGE FROM GARDINA THAT NORMALY TAKES ONE OR TWO DAYS TO GET IT, BUT NOW IT HAS BEEN 4 DAYS AND MY PACKAGE IS NOT ON THE TRACKING SYSTEM OF USPS.< /text>< Pictures>

<text>I have had mail for pick up in my mailbox for two days, with the "flag" up for pick up, yet you wont pick up my mail? You do not know the reason why, but throw out a number of excuses. A business does run on excuses, but on getting the job done! Your worst excuse is, "Well it used to be..... ." That is inexcusable as a manager-administrator, to say to your paying customers.<//text><gmapID>0x80db6f4491d178a1:0x6a547223659d2cdf< /gmapID>< rating>

There seem to be some confusion over who was handling my taxes and I waited 5 days from the day I dropped them off to get them done. Typically it takes an hour if I had sat there instead of doing a drop off.</review>

<Review>I'm long years client of Martha Davis at Rivermark Plaza, Santa Clara, CA 95054. As usual, I was one of her first clients this year with super complex tax return based on US and Foreign income, Income and Housing exclusions, relocation, stocks, etc.
Due to the virus situation, we proceeded with the return online. Martha was able to nail each and every detail and I was super impressed by her professionalism and high standards. She reached out to the tax institute authorities to figure out some very tricky details on the returns. Not only that, be she saved me money that I didn't expect at all.
Not only that, but Martha went above and beyond by her mailing all the documentation to the feds and state for me as I left the country to join my family.
I will remember this experience with Martha forever - a truly dedicated to the customer, acting at the highest possible professional standard in the extraordinary virus situation, working with me from US and Europe and online.
Thank you so much H&R block for having people like Martha Davis working on your side and for best of the client!  Heartily appreciated!<//Review><Response>None<//Response></record></dataset><record>

Took the person that was my advisor 15 min to find my appointment and pull up my documents that I had previously uploaded and I had done my taxes with H&R Block in another location the prior year. She was not able to answer the simple question of how much to file and kept on just showing me the pricing paper they had so I spend the time and did the calculations myself. Every question I asked she looked at me like I just woke her up and she does not want to deal with it and could not answer a simple tax question reply ‘I don’t know’ with such a pride that was almost offensive.

Basically I wasted my time and left without doing my taxes. I am gonna use a self serve software now as they are more helpful and at least I am not pretending there is a value to what H&R Block just offered me!!

By the way does everyone working here have a ‘senior’ title?!<//text>

I make very little and it costs too much. To take 130$ out of less than 400 is a lot. H&R should have a sliding scale fee for those who don't make enough. I went because I have trouble organizing but needed to do taxes. The people were lovely and if I was rich it would have been fine.< /Review>

Mohini Barve was an utmost professional. Her work fills me with the confidence my tax filing needs are being met each year. She communicates very well, provides a comprehensive look at your tax forecast and answers any questions you have patiently and kindly.  Knowing that the person looking after your visit both really cares and is skilled at what they do is a big reason I place faith in H&R Block handling my tax calculations well. Give that woman a raise! ;)<//review>

<review>Lost my refund.
I had a very bad experience. I had to return twice in spite of having booked the appointment. One was even booked by them. They were not ready. While filing taxes they asked if the return should go to the bank account I used last year. He filled in wrong details and I lost my refund. As this was not a year round office, I dint get any help. Other HR block locations also refused to help and asked me to reach out to IRS which din't work either. Overall a very bad experience.<//review><username>Sunil Koundinya< /username><Response>{'time': 1519919667476, 'text': 'Sunil - thank you for taking time to give us feedback!

<review>1 star because I couldn't give zero.
TLDR; The below review exclusively applies to one tax consultant Mr. Bhimbre. I would steer clear of him.

My husband and I had our first appointment on Wednesday at 8 pm, the tax consultant there seemed amiable. After filling our form, the tax consultant wanted us to check our capital gains on stock and get back to him as he could not figure out the information from the documents we had provided (we could figure it out later in an hour), honestly any tax consultant should have been able to do so looking at the Morgan Stanley stock sale documents in 2 mins. Anyways the consultant asked us to come back on a Saturday. We went back on Saturday and we had to pay over 10k in tax dues. Since it was a huge amount and unexpected as well, we mentioned we would like to cross check the amount and come back submit the form. Almost immediately he mentioned that WE ARE WASTING HIS TIME AND CANNOT GIVE "ANOTHER" SLOT. We were taken aback and Seriously did not want to proceed filling our taxes there and after letting our frustrating know in a decently polite tone we mentioned we would like to withdraw our application and pay any fees for the 1.5 hours he spent with us, he mentioned the payment doesn't work in that way and he will give another slot to finish the form. We weren't convinced to continue the application with him and insisted we want out  and (ready to pay), he asked my husband to GET OUT. Yes you read it right! Literally GET OUT.   The worst experience I have had so far. We spoke to person sitting in the reception area and she was very apologetic and my husband insisted we get an apology for "GET OUT" comment, he came said sorry in a very sarcastic manner and was laughing and went inside. The worst experience so far. I would keep clear of him.</review>< resp>

A Very Bad experience... First they book an appointment, and when i visited the place they said the person is not in the river mark plaza office but in different office. Then got a second appointment for Saturday, when i visited saturday morning they told the front desk actually put my appointment for sunday. Convinced them that i need someone to help, they gave me a person, she told that they cannot file the Tax due to dual resident as they dont have any specialization person and one person who is available but only after 1 week. I had to visit 3 times to river mark plaza H & R Block to have work done.  Visited again after one week, my W2 Form had some mistake and they asked to come again after correcting, went again next day the person asked me to come walk inn, when i visited next day he dont have time, and ask me to visit Sunnyvale H & R Block office. Just to make the Sunnyvale person can file my dual resident status and i made visit prior to appointment and he further declines he cannot do it..They wasted my 10 days, the only reason i chose was it was close to my residence.

I would strongly recommend please dont use H & R Block services and opt for any other TAX consultants.<//Text>

The front receptionist looks just like Vanessa Williams!

Nader is pretty dope also!

Their customer service is always on point!

I literally came into the office today and needed my appointment time rescheduled, and they sat me in the dentist’s chair IMMEDIATELY.

They are a great group of PROFESSIONALS!

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM!!!!< /text>

Maria and Denny were super welcoming and nice, they're make a dynamic duo for front facing customer service! Nader was really helpful and accommodating with making my appointments. Doctor Magda and her assistant (whose name sadly I missed!) Were amazing, super accommodating, understanding, and gentle. The location was clean and we'll taken care of. I'm definitely coming back to this dentistry from now on!<//Text>< Pictures>

Recently went to Downey Family Cosmetic Dentistry and the receptionist Maria was very helpful and informed me on everything I needed to know. I definitely recommend coming to this office for a cleaning. They have nice staff and make sure to satisfy their patients.</review>

Bascexperienxe with invisalign braces, its ineffective. Save you money.  I have been using the clear trays for over 2 1/2 years, I stopped using my trays since March due to a tooth ache.  My treatment was plan was for 18 months and now it's been 2 1/2 years later and still my teeth are not straight, gaps still in between.  The invisalign dentist was never really involved, have not seen her in months ever before the pandemic closure of the location.  She has been on maternity leave several times, in the period during my braces.  I complained to the assistant who was more involved and gave me my trays, about the gaps, he would always say to wait for results, it's been now over 2 1/2 years and still have gaps.  Dont waste your time, energy and money.< /text>

Let me start by saying that I don't do reviews, BUT this was defiantly worth my time. The moment I walked through the door I was greeted by Jade. She was so sweet and helpful the whole step of the way... ohh and she was super patient. Sylvia did my e-ray and she was so gentle ( I was in so much pain) she smiled and explained every step as she was doing it. …. Dr. MaryAnn was the just awesome. She took her time to explain what was happening and why. I'm not one to trust dentists but I trust her. I must say, this was the BEST DENTAL office and experience I have ever been to and had. Kind, caring, compassionate, understanding and most helpful set of people work there. So if your looking for a dental home, you've just found it.<//Text>

<Review>Stay away from this dental office and the South Gate location too (Garden Dental)

I cannot say nothing negative about the doctor's because they do their job. The problem is the billing department. Be careful with Nancy!! she is the words.

I don't know if she gets pay commission or what but is hard to trust and deal with an office where the billing department don't know what is doing.

A good collection department is an asset to every business, and asset that can turn into a liability when there is an overzealous and do-it-all collector.

This is the case at Downey Family Cosmetic Dentistry and Garden Dental , his collector also takes care of customer service, interferes with the doctor's decisions and tries to run the office as she wants disregarding patients rights and already signed contracts.

Bill collection being as important as it is for a business should be set aside of customer service, in this office the person in charge of collections interferes in every aspect of the medical treatment including overriding the doctor's orders. She should be emphasize on the payment of accounts instead of poking her nose on items unrelated to her duties.

Please remember how easy liability can extend from one place to the other, also I'm the paying customer and expect to be treated with honesty and respect, I'm not getting NOTHING for free from your dental office and expect to be treated respectfully and that your office shows the professionalism the State of California entrusts you.< /Review>< user_name>

Starting with the staff (Antoinette, Amanda, Melissa, Virginia, Silvia) as you walk in the office, they make you feel so comfortable and welcomed. They always have a smile on their face and are always so willing to answer all your questions and concerns. Then there is Dr. Hadis, what can I say but awesome. She is so caring of all your needs and concerns, she sits there and actually listens to you before she even picks up any equipment. And while she is doing her wonderful work she still is concerned about your well being. From beginning to end not a single once of pain or discomfort, I refer this office and dentist to anyone who really wants to get their dental work done right and feel like they really care about you. Best office and staff hands down.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

This dental office is great, the staff remembers your name and life or at least mine....lol the doctors are super honest and they're really professional. From the front desk to the dental assistants to the doctors, they're all great. They're nice and they are well educated on everything that has to do with dental. I recommend them. They may not be the cheapest, but it's worth every penny and the hospitality is second to none. You won't regret it. :) HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Also<//Text>

I had a deep cleaning and my wisdom teeth taken out. It’s been about a month and I’ve had no problems or concerns. The wait time wasn't long and I didn't feel any pain. I will be returning in the near future to get braces. I am so relieved and happy that I found this dental office.<//Review>

<Review>Love this dental office!  The staff is very kind, thorough, and knowledgeable.  Don't feel like I get the big up-sell or pressure to do things RIGHT NOW. They seem willing to work with you to get a financial plan that works for you. Office is clean, modern, and cool. I appreciate the sterile technique and methods they use - but mostly I think the staff are what make the office such a pleasant place to come to.  Everyone is happy, helpful, and goes out of their way to make sure you are comfortable from the moment you enter to the time you leave.</Review><resp>None<//resp>< userid>

<time>1576115395021</time><rating>5< /rating><text>I am currently in the begining process, of a complete upper/lower set of new teeth, cosmetic implant procedure. I've gone to four other dental offices, before settling on the Downey Family group of doctor's. Here's why.

Probably could have used braces, when I was younger. I'm sure it would have been beneficial, as to a better position, at this time of repairing my broken mouth. I'm 64yrs, and growing up as one of the baby boomers, my parents couldn't afford me having them. But such is life, and put me on the road of dental neglect, over the years. I had my wisdom teeth, extracted in my late twenties. But as far as check-ups and regularly seeing a dentist, it wasn't in my routine. I only had a couple of cavities, over the years, but filling those was the extent of my 'fear of regular' dentist visits.

The Downey Group of doctor's and reception personel, have completely scrubbed away my fears, everyone is sooo friendly and personable, that I'm really looking forward to taking this this, and my smile, to the next level, through them. I highly recommend them, as my future for life, dentists. Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart, which doesn't shine without my friendly smile. You're the best.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Downey Family Cosmetic Dentistry have allowed me to have positive thoughts about going to the dentist. I really enjoy the communication reminders, the attention to detail and the positive customer service.

The ladies at the front are very attentive and the hygienists/doctors are very thorough when explaining & throughout the procedure you are getting done.

I would recommend this clinic (or any of the other one of their clinics) to any friend or anyone who is looking for a dentist.< /Review>

I highly recommend this group. It was very easy to make an appointment. I was seen on time and never felt rushed. The staff is very professional and friendly. Dr.Reyhani is very careful and made sure I was not in pain. I felt very comfortable during the entire procedure. The office is clean and the atmosphere calming. I will definitely continue to get my care here.<//Review>

<Text>They say they work with insurances, but in reality you have a huge bill, aside from their credit card bill payment if you qualify. We now go to a dentist who has done work on my husband and myself (cleaning, gum treatments, root canals, bridges) and they bill "everything" to the insurance; we don't have a co pay or paid anything out of pocket. Don't get me wrong, the staff and dentists are good and extremely friendly here at Downey Cosmetics, but with what you end up paying it's no wonder!< /Text><userid>105237511712490675972< /userid><Date>1522873599011< /Date>< Pictures>

First of I was quoted 32k for services. I then returned and somehow the quote stated 40k. I clearly had a paper in my hand that indicated 32k. However I asked for an explanation and was taken to a room to start a deep cleaning that costs 1060 for all for quadrants. Only 2 quadrants were done due to the dentist having other appointments. I was told I could return the same day at 12p only to be told that the dentist wouldn't have time to finish the other two quadrants. My questions weren't answered. After the deep cleaning I was in so much pain I forgot to mention it. I then contacted DFCD in regards to the pain I was experiencing. They stated that they couldnt provide any pain medication for the type of service that was performed. I have suffered with TMJ for the past 8 years which creates EXTREME pain when opening and/or extending the jaw. I completely disappointed with their customer service. I wouldnt reccomend this place to anyone in need of extensive work.</review>

Came here a couple months ago to start a new treatment since my last dentist left me traumatized. They made me feel welcomed and cared about. The always greet you right when you walk in and get you in to see the dentist right away. I can also gladly say that they will get you in ASAP if you have any issues with your teeth. I, for example, had a bad tooth ache and they were able to offer me a same day appointment. Friendly staff and great service!</Text>

<Text>This is the best dental office I have ever been to. I recently had a very bad experience getting dental treatment in Mexico. The doctor in Mexico didn't even complete the root canal and my other fillings needed to be replaced with crowns. This was only three months ago. I came to Downey Family Cosmetic Dentistry after many sleepless nights due to pain. They took care of me and made me feel like a priority. They worked with me financially so I could get all my dental work done at a reasonable cost. I am so thankful for Dr. Ben Reyhani and Dr. Amir. From the very beginning, they were very honest with me about my treatment and made me feel like I had a choice. I am so thankful to the whole staff. The girls in the front, and the assistants in the back. Thank you. Thank you.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<review>I just had 2 fillings done and got my teeth cleaned. A few things I noticed:
-This is a very clean/nice office
-The staff really cares about their work
-They have some high tech equipment that I have never seen before
-Dr. Hadis is really nice and patient

I am really lucky that I went to this office this time around. It turns out that I had a cavity under an old filling (done by another dentist) that would have gone undetected if it wasn't for the ultra high tech sensor they had in this office that found it. Any other average dental office would have missed it and I WOULD HAVE EVENTUALLY NEEDED A ROOT CANAL!!! Dr. Hadis saved me.

My first call to this place had me hooked on the excellent customer service this office offers by their "how can I  make you smile today" frase.  You can bearly feel the anaesthesia shots when needed and the cleanings are thorough. They make sure your visit is as painless as possible and that's a plus for me. I'm moving from Downey but will continue to visit thier sister location near Covina. They also offer the best cadaver bone in town for implants.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

The receptionist guy was terribly DUMB and had NO customer service at all whatsoever. I would never want to turn my my docs to this Consulate. They need to get rid of this Virus there and put someone who is patient and smart enough to understand people’s issues<//text>

<text>I needed an entry permit for my 4 years old . The guy at the window was awesome. He was great in responding to people’s questions. He even rushed and finished my work quicker when I told him we have a flight to catch. I asked for his name, so I could use it in this review, but he said it is against the police. It was a completely different experience than what I had in 2015 when I visited the consulate for the first time. Thank you!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Review>The waiting room was very warm with no cooling facilities.  Unfortunately, you never imagined that you were inside a country agency in Angels, where millions of dollars were spent just for an embassy wall, but the facilities of General Cancel are not as big as a Kabul teahouse.  Unfortunately, due to the control of the papers, I waited for two and a half hours for him to come and sign the documents.  It is quite embarrassing for the country's representative to receive its own people in this way.<//Review>< Pics>

<rate>1</rate><Review>This is ridiculous 😒 no one answers the phone.
I just have 2 questions?
I downloaded the fingerprint form from their website. Police station doesn't do fingerprint anymore.
I took the form to a notary puplic, they don't notarize my fingerprint either.
1- Do I need send the fingerprint form without notarized stamped or what?
2- Does the Afghan consulate in Los Angeles extend passport or not?

Great Consulate..just a bit hard to find.

The services were quick and easy, and the staff was very friendly. The Afghan lady who does most of the work it seems was very efficient and to the point. Thanks for that! ډیره مننه

The phone response is a bit slow, but they did respond eventually. One could try routing to them through the Afghan Embassy in Washington which I Did.

Overall, great and quick experience!

<Review>The customer service is even worse than Afghanistan. They put on their website that they don’t accept walk-ins, but when I called numerous times and left several voice messages no one returned my calls. They probably make it harder for customers to provide an opportunity for some money under the table, just like Afghanistan.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Gmap_id>0x80c2b9568ea27e5d:0x70191993f593ad1a<//Gmap_id>< Rate>

<Text>Worse Consulate ever Seen! Their services are fully down, you can not contact them, they only have a reception phone number in their contact and that always transfer your call to voice mail, once you leave a voice mail will never hear back from them. really disappointed from their services in such technical and advance word.< /Text>< pictures>

The employees in this consulate are very unprofessional and uneducated, they are all fraudulent people.
They've asked me to send my son's original birth certificate by mail for the permit to travel, but they lost my son's original birth certificate. They are irresponsible & they sell your identification to illegal aliens.<//Text>

I have mixed feelings about the place. Customer service staff are polite with low energy and void of any desire to be helpful or to get things done in a hurry. Good luck getting any helpful information or guidance from them. They have no motivation, risk or reward to provide better or efficient service. It's like going to DMV and expecting customer service.< /text>

I have been calling them for the longest, sent them an email, approached them on facebook but NO ANSWER in no where. If this was an American they would have sued them but we just have to sit quite and wait for them but I will not and Im going to take this matter to someone who can actually teach them how to do their job. A husband and wife is the lead in there how can people expect them to do anything for afghans, I'm sure they aren't even open for the hours listed on here and if they are they lock the door from inside, sit keep eating pork until closing and leave. SHAME ON ALL OF YOU WORKING THERE.< /Text>

Great customer service, to be honest, I never expected such great people in our Afghan offices. I needed a passport for my wife due to a family emergency, the staff took care of it in one day while it normally takes 14 days.

Thank you again for the prompt service. 👍👍👍</Review>

<Review>Unprofessional people sitting there. They don’t know how to answer phone calls. They don’t know how to speak to their own people. If it comes to Non Afghan they kiss their Hands. But sorry to say they treat their own people very Bad. If u guys needs to get anything done from this embassy. Find out different way to get your work done. Unless you Have one year to wait.</Review><Resp>None<//Resp>< UserId.>

I rarely write a review, I went to our own Afghan Consulate and saw old women's, who has been suffering from sugar has been awaiting for last 3 to 4 hours only for a letter and no one helping them. Secondly, As its like a small window and they hear with one ear and give solutions from their own, wait i will go and ask hours passed, but nothing. it looks like - consulate staffs are very weak/very lazy to work. They ask you to email, but never ever responds back. pls appoint professional people, who can serve people not sleep in consulate.<//review>

Hello all viewers,

I drove all the way from East Bay to LA which took me almost seven hours. I spend a night in a hotel in Hollywood and went to The Consulate next day. I've already prepared all needed documents which was mentioned on the website.
All the staffs were very friendly. There was a little bit confusion. They asked for some documents which were not mentioned on the website. However I made those documents ready there and submitted to them. They took my original documents and there is no guarantee if they get lost. However I took the risk and hope to get them back.
Recommendation:
They need to work on their website a little bit and keep it up to date.
Over all good staff.< /Text>

<Text>Why won't they answer their phone? I have been calling for the last couple of days. They don't even have a voicemail set up. Please try to pay attention to your customer service. We Afghans depend on your service when it comes to our Afghan passport and national ID card. We need your service and if you are not doing your job, please leave so someone else with better work ethics can step in. This is ridiculous.<//Text>< pics>

My Afghan brothers and sisters don't complain we are Afghans we should suffer even in USA from our government.by the way it's a branch of Afghan government even worse than offices in Afghanistan,I applied for birth certificate and passport they promised To send me passport and birth certificate in 14 days but I got my passport after 25 days. Instead of birth certificate they mailed application and money order of my birth certificate finally after two days of calling them they answered the phone I told the lady you guys send my application back without sending my  birth certificate, you know what she told me she said send it back to us we forgot to apply for you even she didn't apologize.i told her you guys couldn't see the money order ,application,copy of my document ,long story short she transferred my call to another lady, this lady was already mad at me she started fighting on the phone with me. The  First Lady was talking a little bit nicer than her , this lady told me send it back or come back apply again and she hang up the phone.then I give up I said  need the birth certificate cancelled my plan going to Kabul. They  wasted my time driving from San Francisco to LA.</Text>

The Afghan Consulate in Las Angeles are doing an excellent job, they are doing work with amazing speed up, great professionalism, listening to clients and taking care of the clients needs on the spot.

They have very talented and customer oriented staff,  I have called several times in a day and had so many questions, every time I called they were pleased to help and happily assisted, they are expert in their work and very professional.

I was assisted by Shahnaz Amin and she was greatly able to give me all details I needed and sent me the forms that I needed to fill up and submit back to the Consulate. Greatly Appreciated.<//Text>

<review>I hope I could give them less than one Star I have been waiting for an email for them to receive and they have not received it yet, YES they didnt receive an EMAIL  for a month. it is about a Police Certificate from Afghanistan Ministry of foreign Affairs my family went to ministry of foreign affairs 10 times so finally the stuff at ministry of foreign affairs in Afghanistan had my family see the email sent 2 times right in front of them but this Embassy never received we are living in 2018 COME ON so I called Washington DC Afghanistan Embassy They didnt receive either now I look up the government system it is so Corrupt that I cant believe it, I am so ashamed of our people and these stuff working at these high rank levels that they dont deserve it at all. if these people are so lazy or useless to work let the young generation take over cause they know they computer system and they are knowledgeable rather than having no jobs with higher degrees they have.< /review><gmap_id>0x80c2b9568ea27e5d:0x70191993f593ad1a<//gmap_id>< rate>

I have not any interaction with this consulate so far,  going to apply for computerized passports next week, so i am keeping my fingers crossed i would not have any issues. Giving the 5 stars just to get somebody's attention at the consulate, that at least they should try to change their ratings and service. Each time an Afghan walks into this consulate should come somewhat satisfied. My question, is somebody at the Embassy reading these disgrunted cutomers?< /Text>

<Text>This is the worst nightmare one can experience. My old Afghan passport expired just last month. I flew from Northern CA to LA in hopes of getting a useless Afghan passport to go visit my ailing father overseas, where an Afghan passport is needed for entry. Let's not talk about how they treat you at the front desk. They asked for my Tazkara!!! I don't have it. I've been out of the country for past 25 years. Nope. You have to have a tazkara to get a passport. That's the only way, I'm told. The idiot guy tells me have someone in Afghanistan go to Ministry of Interior and get me a Tazkara!!!! This is stupid. I'm right in front of their eyes, speaking Dari, holding my US passport and Citizenship, AND and expired Afghan passport for them to verify my identity, yet they want want something from Afghanistan where nobody knows who I am. Eventually, the guy made a killer suggestion. He suggested I go to Afghanistan, get a Tazkara, and a passport! Seriously? Sorry fellas, these are the people that represent us. Shame on them.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Worst customer service ever.
I called them to ask on the status of my visa, a lady answered the call, she said she will call me back in few minutes. Never got a call back, never.

I wouldn't be surprised if I had such a customer service in AFG, but I thought maybe these guys are better than those folks in AFG coz they have a chance to see the standards of customer service in the U.S. but unfortunately they've brought this bad customer service culture with them from AFG and I have no hope if it would change.</text>

<review>They don't deserve even one star. They are not qualified to manage the embassy.  They are a bunch of uneducated and uncivilized people. They don't care about the customers at all. The funny thing is that they are not aware about what they have posted in their official website!! 😒</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

From last one week trying to get hold of them but no one is answering if they really don't care about their responsibility and just want to make money then they need to colse that branch and find another things to do in United States they're working like they're in Afghanistan with no responsibility.< /Review>

The worst customer service
The worst experience of my life
That's why we never grow up  that's why we never get better because that's how Afghan people work
it's a shame completely shame
I was support to get my wife's visa in two days it's been two week I've been calling them nobody's answering I just wanna know that they have everything so we can have the visa I already bought my ticket and I don't know how long it's gonna take for visa
They're working just like Afghanistan offices
That means nobody's working over there
It's been three days I'm asking can you guys check the email I sent a paper they say  the guy who checked the email is not here  , what the hell is that mean ?<//review>

That's half stars not one, they don't know what they are doing and I'm calling over and over even the phone doesn't ring, just like Afghanistan they are trying to make your job hard I'm really disappointed I really don't wanna say anything else I just wish I wasn't a Afghanistan citizen I'm really asha.</Text>

I share my experience with all My folks
If you want your passport to be mail to your address from LA you should get an envelope from post office with tracking number both for $6 otherwise those people in consulate will ask you $25 money order
At that moment if you try to go to post office to get envelope it will take one hour to post office with that crazy traffic in LA
Thank you
Good luck< /Review>

So frustrating, I think this office is full of incompetent people, I can never get hold of them through phone I have been trying to call them for the past 5 days in the times that they have specified open hours. I think they still haven't heard of email, does not respond to any emails. Does not reply to any mails through post. I could have probably got my job done from Washington if I wrote to them by now.< /Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Hello to all my dear and sad Afghans! In every corner of the world to be honest and honest. The Consulate of Afghanistan residing in Las Vegas has nothing to do except to sue the Afghans residing in California. It may take a week if I file a complaint against this fake office. May God (c) make the officials of this office understand their duty to the works that are paid from the Afghan Government !!! And don't hurt people !!! They are just sitting in their seats for money and misery! And their nose is in the sky They think they know everything but alas a hundred alas !!!

سلام به همه افغان های نازنین و غم دیده من! در هر گوشه و کنار دنیا که استین باعزت و با صحت باشین . قونسولگری افغانستان مقیم لاسنجلس به غیر از زایع کردن افغان های مقیم کالیفرنیا دیگر کاری ندارند اگر شکایت در مقابل این دفتر ساختگی شروع کنم شاید یک هفته را بگیرد . خدا(ج) کند که معسولین این دفتر به کار هایکه از آن از دولت افغانستان معاش پرداخت می‌شوند وظیفه خود را درک کنند !!! و مردم آزاری نکند !!! فقط بخاطر پول و فاچاقبری در کرسی های خود نشسته اند !!! و دماغ شان به آسمان است فکر می‌کنند که از همه چیز آگاه استند اما افسوس صد افسوس !!!</Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

No, just no. Don't trust these guys. Especially the guy in the front Cisco. I called to see about a cut and they said yes come down we can get you in  now. Only thing that saved them from a one star.
I asked is the guy good? Would you put money on him. He said yes. I got a shiitty cut. The fade on both sides is uneven and sloppy. The scissors and shaver felt dirty and not sharp. No lineup and it barely looks like I got a cut. $35 and an hour later. I'd never go back or give them any more business. Look elsewhere. Cisco. Shame on you bro. Your dishonesty cost this place further business and this review.<//review>

My husband went here to have his hair cut and it took an hour for a simple cut. The guy was distracted and too busy watching breaking bad and talking to his buddies to pay attention to what he was supposed to be doing. After my husband washed all the styling gel from his hair later that night, we notice that the guy didnt pay any attention to detail and there are alot of hairs that are noticeably uneven. The styling gel hid all the mistakes he made. We are very disappointed and we will not be returning to this place of business.< /text>

<rating>2</rating><review>First thing you’d notice is the lack of professionalism by some of the barbers. This mainly pertains to the young ones who were simply playing video games next to me as if they were at they’re house. Place didn’t feel welcoming at all. The guy who gave me a haircut was mediocre and did not come out great, and for the price of $25 was ridiculous for the quality and experienced that I witnessed. One thing that really irritated me was the fact that they didn’t use a register even though they had one. Barber pulled cash out of his pocket to give me change and the transaction was done like this. Felt like I was in a low-tier barber and would not recommend this place.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

I was pretty disappointed. I was paired with a barber who had so much difficulty speaking English. Also, this place is cash-only, and I had to withdraw money from its in-house ATM that charged ~$3. These by themselves deserve one-star. To be fair, haircut was not too bad, but it did not deserve $25.<//Review>

They do amazing work of any kind of hair! Honestly, the vibe is right and the barbers are on point! Everyone here is friendly albeit a long wait at times and the appointments are priced accordingly. Expect the use of straight razors, warm foam, hot towels, and accurate line ups! Alot of the barbers here started off pretty traditionally so they can get down with almost any style.< /Review>

< Review>
I called to see if they cut black hair for my son. They said they did and told me kids cuts were $15. So I made an appointment and they did a good job. I went back a second time. I made an appointment just like the last time, but when I went to pay they told me it would be $20. I explained that last time is was told kids hair cuts are $15 (my son got the same cut both times) the guy at the register says "it's more if you make an appointment." I explained I made an appointment last time and it was still only $15. He says "well I must have given you a special. I could charge you $35." I just say him charge a man and his son $35 for their hair cuts. So clearly he was just being rude because I called him out on his lies. I felt very insulted and disrespected. It's a shame they would treat a customer like that. My son liked this place and they did a good job but I won't go anywhere where they are so disrespectful.<//Review>

<Text>Service is terrible, walked in on Saturday morning 900 am. There was 1 guy in the chair and 4 waiting. 1 barber in the entire shop, who buy the way didn't say a word when we entered. After waiting 5 minutes I finally asked him how long the wait would be. He responded that it would be over an hour and that there should be more barbers there. I took that as my signal to exit and look for a business that appreciates their customers. Fail fail fail< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Came here for the 1st time and will never go back there again. Wanted a regular fade with a 1/2 on the side, and 4 on top.. should of been a  EASY cut!! and the dude didn't even go even on the top of my head. Went home to put gel, f $%king horrible. And you can see my line on the side of my head.. SMFH!! For 22.00 I don't think so. And the homeboy reeked like smoke. F%%k man!!< /review>

Walking service sucks I don't like how they dont even tell you "we'll be right with you." And  appointments they even offer their sit for comfort.  As a walking I still pay and leave a tip spending 30 dollars Just like appointments.< /text>

they do a good job of keeping solid barbers at the chairs here. High volume means minimal wait times if you aren't making an appointment, and the small town vibes make the place it's own. all else aside, they need a new cashier.<//Review>

A little higher price and can be a longer wait at times but most of the barbers are really good at what they do.</Review>

Very bad experience, coming here for over 2 years since I moved to Cali,  owner Mike very respectful and helpful, employees are very aggressive, and hostile, not a place I would bring children, I have psoriasis and was treated very uncomfortable, barber was unaware how to help a cust like that, then multiple employees got very defensive and would not help, but wanted to push me out. Feels like employees turning it into a personal hang out.<//Review>

<rating>1< /rating><text>I'll keep it short I went in here looking for a haircut I get in the chair first thing my barber does is break out shaver that u use for a close shave on ur face so from that point on I had a feeling black peoples hair might not be his forte so as I'm getting the cut the guy next to me starts going off about a Chappelle joke.....chill it's a joke , once the cut was over he put a mirror close to my face so I couldn't see the damage of what he did then he didn't put any antiseptic on the area with close cuts I get home and examine closely my hairline was thrown so far back even the sides didn't match up so I wouldn't b going again< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

By far the worst hair cut my 1 year old what was supposed to be a skin fade literally shaved his head and paid $25 oh heck no I've paid for $15 for a actual skin fade either need better accurate barbers who know the difference of a skin fade and bald<//Review>

Currently here at the moment sitting in my car catching up on some emails.
Pros: Its a nice scenic and spacious park in a residential area. It looks safe.

Cons: there is a homeless presence and the bathrooms are closed. A big no no in my book.</text>

< Review>
Sandwiched between two neighborhoods and right off of Thousand Oaks Blvd, this is a large park popular for soccer games, parties, jogging, and dog walking. There is a basketball court, a covered patio area, a playground, horseshoe court, and a large grassy field. Bathrooms are unisex and lock after dark. There's parking all around the park but its shared with the nearby condos and mechanics.
The playground has been renovated in the last few years and is very nice. There are also a number of majestic, tall oak trees that shade much of the park.<//Review>

Very clean park with water fountains, bathrooms, swings for both infants and older children. It has a mixture of soft asphalt, sand and wood chips in the play areas. Large park with baseball backdrop and basketball court near by. Also a walking trail around the edge</review>

<text>"hidden" behind the storefronts on T.O. Blvd (namely Jim Allen Motors) this is a medium sized park with a cool play area for the little ones, and lots of grass for sports and such. There are basketball courts too. Not a ton of shade, but yeah- it's a good park.</text>< Pictures>

As nature lover, Park is the place where I spend most of my leisure time and this is one more place where I sit down with friends. Very clean and nice environment.</Review>

Keep your children away from this area.
Especially now, since governor Newsom demands that we allow homeless vagrants drug users to sleep and live in our once beautiful new park.<//review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

Strong 4 for this burger. Haven’t had anything else on the menu. Perfectly cooked as ordered, great bun freshness/texture, very simple execution. Just how a burger should be. The fries were perfect amount (maybe a little too many) and they were freshly fried. Price was reasonable for a Napa hamburger, too. Can’t beat sitting by the open fire either.<//review>

<text>There are always high expectations when dining at a Michelin star restaurant. La Toque does not meet them. The service was great except for the sommelier who didn’t explain the terrible wine pairings. It’s the first time I had the wine pairings actually ruin the food experience. No progression in the tasting menu. The salmon was good, pasta was ok and the veal was too smoky and fatty. Dessert was a stale cookie smothered in cherries with another undrinkable wine. Would not spend the money here.< /text>< UserId.>

<Time>1621614553693< /Time><Rate>1< /Rate><text>We had been here once before a couple of years ago. We did not have a good experience this time. Far from it.

The food seemed cheap and tasteless .They started with a fennel cucumber salad that had very little flavor and was maybe a teaspoon portion. No imagination and no flavor. It went down hill from there. The wine pairing was an assortment of cheap wines and we did not have a Sommelier present to describe the pairing. The waiter simply muffled the name on the bottle through his mask and quickly left. There was no interaction . They ended with a dessert they called cherry s’mores which tasted like something put together out of their pantry using a wafer and couple  of cherries cut in half with a marshmallow topping.

We spent $650 per couple and feel ripped off. We have Ben coming to Napa for over 20 years and have never felt this way . Napa is special, this restaurant is not worth going to unless you want to spend a lot of money to feel disappointed and taken advantage of. Let me guess............ This is due to Covid?????? Not! We will never be back.<//text>< Pictures>

<rating>2<//rating><review>I will have to say that our server, Savannah was great.  This review is absolutely no reflection on the service.  The question I would have for the chef is simply, would you have served what you served to the whomever gave you a Michelin star?  I don't think so.  Located in Napa, the wines paired with our "Chef Tastings" were all from France.  Really?  I am appalled at the lack of imagination, the barely tolerable preparation and the complete disassociation of quality and value.  If you have eaten here and feel you received your moneys worth, I would recommend you expand your horizons.  Not only would we never dine there again I seriously wonder about the value of a Michelin star. To compare a similar cost dining experience, Jules Verne Restaurant in Paris France was far surperior.  Jules Verne was worth it, La Toque, not.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

My wife and some friends did the full tasting menu here.  One of us was also Celiac, so it was nice that they adjusted her menu to be Gluten Free and still got her most of what we had.  The service was great, the wait staff was super attentive and welcoming.  The outdoor seating was really well done and felt very comfortable.  I don't drink wine, but I'm told that the wine pairing was actually great.  We did add a couple extra Black Truffle dishes and the stand out ended up being a Black Truffle spaghetti.  The other items were all very good.  I think it's a great spot if you want a tasting menu, perhaps not the best, but certainly worthy of their Michelin Star.</review>

It falls short compared to other Michelin star restaurants in the vicinity of SF, especially when taking the exorbitant price into account.

We ordered the wine pairing to go with each dish and struggled to perceive how any of the wines enhanced the food, or vice versa. The person who poured the wines added nothing beyond what was already printed on the menu.

Two of the courses were tasty, interesting, but not particularly daring takes on existing dishes (scallop ceviche, and fish and chips). One dish was outstanding in its creativity and flavor (a ravioli-type pasta). The lamb rack was good, but one could find something comparable at a decent steakhouse for a better price. The vegetable ragout meant to be a side for the lamb was oversalted and inedible, souring the meal, though the staff reacted swiftly and admirably to replace it.

Dessert was good, though not exactly noteworthy, with our choices of a citrus ricotta crepe and a chocolate concorde cake.

I commend the staff for delivering excellent service, but for the price, the food needed to be at that same level of excellence. Overall, this was a disappointment, a contrast with every other wonderful meal we had in Napa at a fraction of the cost.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOTcrpCP0bajqoSkvZyuUUTw2gwf7IoZsIjfv8E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpr2rLGxolNgDkH3XHAxUCPeS_13jHK1QEFyIQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrYruIqjglCD3Rum9osjB70uWrEShhoYPJ_gAG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdqqBuTNYp89O5BzWzRT7BotDiTSkT_1NyjzlD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPY5SR4fOrZEZIQgdgeVDGvAZJrRPSp3vu1RWCZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPb0bRifE-o6jqfeh_im5f0OE-y1lDMlrrdKzSl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQ1JGVdztUdWZtX0tcvSvp2B6gVXvKbb2Nf64d=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x808506614c768671:0xde51b62058db3bce</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Fantastic service and great venue. I was a little disappointed with the taster menu, particularly the snapper course. All in all, it didn't feel like a $500 experience for two people. Also, they added a 20% service charge on which is then taxed, making dinner even more expensive.< /Review>

Probably one of the quieter restaurants here in the valley. Caught their Michelin star by chance, as we wouldn't have found them if not for the fact that we were staying at Westin. Good selection of french food menu, and service was impeccable. Prices are definitely on the higher side, but it's Napa Valley, and it's a Michelin dining experience, so well within expectations.< /Review>

Was so excited to celebrate an anniversary here. First off, I understand it's COVID. I know restaurants are under unimaginable pressure with all of the public health regulations. This place took it too far. I was scolded the whole night! My drink took forever which normally I wouldn't mind but I knew once it hit the table the policing would stop. I've been dining out for months since things have opened up and I've never had so much nannying once I've already been sat at a table. We didn't experience this at any other restaurants in the Valley that weekend or the weekend prior.

We would have left but it was late and they had our CC charged for the res. If the food was great it would have softened the blow to this terrible experience but it was lackluster. The tempura was soft. Tempura without a bite is a tragedy. The fish was slimy and flavorless. Our favorite part of the meal was the bread! Sourdough whole wheat? The patio is gorgeous with the awning and soft light. They did nail the ambiance.<//review>

VERY modern and well equipped restaurant with a full bar and friendly staff.  We were the first diners to arrive on the evening of our reservation that was booked WELL in advance.  The meal was indeed marvelous, and foreshadowed what other delights the Napa area held in store for us over the next 5 days we spent there.  Too busy enjoying the wonderful meal and wine to make more substantial notes, please look at the appetizing photos!  I still love you MEM.<//Text></record>

The food was amazing!  The service was friendly and I didn't feel a pompous attitude from anybody in the staff.

I spent Valentine's evening dinner here and they really made the night special.  It was 5 course prix fixe menu that offered a wine pairing with 4 of the 5 dishes.  The 5th and final dish was dessert and for an additional charge of $15 for that pairing.

Overall the cost breakdown was as follows:
$150 5-course prix fixe menu
$80 for 4 wine pairings
$15 additional wine pairing with dessert
20% Service charge (no additional tip required)

I'm not one to dine at fine dining establishments often, but I felt as if the service was amazing.  Our main server was fun and friendly.  She was attentive to our pacing.  Each dish we had came paired with some wine.  As we finished each course, we always had some wine leftover in our glasses.  She ensured we had time to finish our wine prior to bringing out the next course.  Because of her, we didn't feel rushed.  We had time to enjoy our wine and have good conversations without feeling rushed.

Given the cost, everything was completely worth it.  It's not a place an average person can afford, but it was definitely an experience worth having at least once in your life.< /text>

The service was amazing. Everyone was very warm and attentive. Unfortunately the food was ok, really just ok. Every course was just missing that wow factor. We did the chef’s tasting menu and when we completed our meal, we were all more impressed with the wine and cocktails than the actual food.
With the hefty price tag, the kitchen cannot afford to have an off night.
When you go to a Michelin Star restaurant you would expect to get blown away, definitely not the case.<//Text>

Extremely expensive, but a wonderful place for a special occasion.  Service was outstanding.  Food was excellent and well balanced, though not better than many meals I have had at outstanding restaurants for much less.  Overall a wonderful experience in wine country!</Text>

Service is great. Atmosphere is great. The food is just ok. We got the chef tasting menu and, while delicious, I’m just not sure if it was delicious enough for the price tag. I wanted an explosion in my mouth but I got a fire cracker.< /text>

<text>Underwhelming!

We recently spent a long weekend in Yountville for a special occasion but unfortunately, no aspect of our experience at La Toque met our expectations. After being greeted warmly and being offered a glass of champagne to start off, we both picked our tasting menus. One of the reasons we chose La Toque was that they do offer a vegetable tasting menu, which my fiancé chose. Unfortunately, her dinner was a big disappointment all around. The bottom line was that there was just not enough food and whatever was there was not very special at all. The cauliflower soup to start was probably the best course. The tempura vegetables were dry and fried too long, the wild mushrooms were barely a taste, and there was even less of the heirloom beets. At that point she really hoped for the pasta, but what arrived were two small specks of noodle, a few green dots, one sunchoke and maybe a mushroom (we’re not sure). All around, her dinner was a complete bust and she walked out of the restaurant hungry.

I chose the standard tasting menu and didn’t fare much better. Most courses on the standard tasting menu were just not that special. The greeting from the kitchen – deviled duck eggs – were tasty. My choices after that were carpaccio (bland), black cod (the fish was fine, the accompanying sauce was the best part of my dinner), duck breast (not a lot of meat, tender but hardly any sides), and then red snapper (odd to have fish after duck again – the fermented beans were weird and the rest of the sides were not exciting). Our desserts – the wall of chocolate and the truffle ice cream sandwich – were also just OK and plain and simple not good enough to convince us that we had just eaten dinner at a Michelin starred restaurant.

Aside from the disappointing food, one of the other things that we did not like was the fact that eating at La Toque felt like you had a fine dining dinner at a hotel restaurant that will serve a buffet breakfast at the same place a few hours later. Tables were set with odd fitted plastic covers that do not at all convey a feeling of high-end dining and tables, chairs and booths placed in a non-descript square room felt cheap.

Unfortunately, this was not at all what we hoped for. We do not recommend La Toque.< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>My wife and I were excited to experience the Chef’s Tasting Menu and the Wine Pairing at La Toque. We found the meal to be somewhat average even compared to a “normal” meal. Among other things, the diced Yukon gold potatoes seemed to be used in two different courses, and the truffles were used in four places across three different offerings. The cut for the New York strip was subprime and so tough, my wife to not even attempt to finish it. While the dessert seemed to outshine the rest of the meal, they still served a chewy meringue that was difficult to eat. The wine selections were great. Maybe our expectations were set too high, knowing this was a Michelin Star restaurant, but we certainly came away disappointed, wondering if we missed something.<//Review>< user>

<date>1569871530091< /date><text>Really good food for the most part, and interesting to boot. We were treated to the Gulf Red Snapper, dry aged duck breast, New Zealand John Dory (fish), and were all excellent. The tempura Kauai Blue Shrimp were disappointing. It may just be the nature warm water shrimp, but I found them to be dry and tough. The tempura itself was crisp and not at all greasy.
The wine pairings were very good according to my partner.
The "Gifts from the kitchen" were good pallet refreshers. At $110 a pop (+ $55 for the wine paring), calling it a "gift' was kind of funny.
The waitstaff were all friendly and helpful.<//text>< resp>

We liked the quietness, the restaurant kept social distancing just right, the wait staff was alert and ready, the color and light balanced nicely with the furnishing and plate ware.

What was missing was the food.  It was just ok.  But kudos for trying in the time of Covid.

I would come back just for the service, and the atmosphere.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

truly amazing cuisine that never disappoints! The staff is very friendly, the sommelier team are welcoming and non-pretentious, and all in all you can expect nothing but incredible service, amazing food, and leaving with your belly full!

La Toque earns their Michelin star rating with an absolutely wonderful tastings menu that is offered standard and without meat. They use seasonal ingredients (truffles when I was there) to further the dishes and keep the menu refreshed. A must eat in Napa< /review>

After enjoying multiple Michelin starred restaurants throughout Europe, we were very underwhelmed by La Toque.  To start, we were seated in a booth after the staff never even offered to take our jackets.  The booth was along a window that faced the hotel entry driveway which flashed headlights directly at us until we finally closed the drapes on our own.  The ambiance was further ruined by overly bright fake candles on the table and music that was distractingly loud.  The food overall, especially on the vegetarian tasting menu, was uninspired and lacked flavor.  It was disappointing to have an entire course composed of only half an avocado still in the skin with a small amount of tomato broth.  Multiple courses had mushrooms not cut properly leaving the unpleasant, woody root at the bottom.  The best dish was what the staff brought to compensate for the dry and utterly flavorless  vegetarian cassoulet.  Lastly, while the sommelier was clearly very knowledge and paired the wines well with the food, he lacked passion in his interaction with us and seemed to simply recite a preset script. Overall, I question how this establishment has maintained a Michelin star.</Review>

I have been there twice invites by friends. Very interesting place. I would give 4 stars for the dishes, between good and very good. But the service of the staff . . . 3 stars. They can do better.</text>

Be aware that the chef went to the school of small food. However, it was intriguing and wonderful.  Each wine pairing was delicious and they were generous with the shaved black truffles. Service was excellent. Very expensive.</review>

I only gave this four stars so as not to affect the score for this restaurant. However, to give the restaurant the sense of the power of bad google reviews let me relay the following -- after making reservations at La Toque, I decided I'd rather eat the $100 than risk what seems like a terrible service experience after reading the reviews here the day before we were supposed to dine.  If you read the reviews, several them note slow, poor service.  The owner or someone working for them attempts to make excuses, but when you have that many folks making the same comments, they can't all be wrong.  If this were not Michelin starred or didn't cost a high amount, you could forgive some of it.  But service is one of the key points to a Michelin restaurant and I hope the guide takes note of it in the future.  It doesn't help that there's very mixed reviews about this place as well when you ask people who actually live here and reiterate the service issues.  Service and quality servers are within the control of the restaurant.  Look at other Michelin starred places -- I don't think I've ever seen such comments at other restaurants in such volume.  We skipped and had a fine meal elsewhere.  The reviews are read by fine diners and this particular diner took the warnings from others here seriously.<//Text>

It is not worthy of a Michelin star. One of the dishes was a lobster salad which was jello with lobster in it and awful (very eighty’s style). We also added truffles which tasted stale with minimal flavor. The sommelier pushed expensive glasses of wine instead of recommending a bottle for us (which is what we had asked for). Felt robbed for the price and quality of the food. Would not return. The restaurant was also empty which is an indication of the quality of the food and dining experience.</text>

Went for a birthday dinner. Complimentary valet parking. Nice room, booths are best. Staff very friendly and efficient in the service.  Had truffle tasting menu. Very good. Right size portions, nice timing. Had wine pairing. Sommelier a bit formal, but the wines bang on. Was like he was reading from a script and dodged questions. They add 20% gratuity but would have done that anyway. Nice dinner.</Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>I have enjoyed many meals at La Toque, and each one has kept me coming back for more.  Extremely talented chefs with knowledgeable servers & sommeliers.  They do fun things throughout the meal that remind me why they have held their Michelin star for so many many years.

Chefs menu let's you enjoy the best of what La Toque offers without having to make any decisions.  Traditionally, you get 9 courses that includes appetizers, mids, mains, cheese & desserts.

There are also 4 & 5 courses options where you get to create your own dining experience by selecting 3-4 savory dishes plus a dessert or cheese to finish things off.

Last but definitely not least, La Toque offers a full vegetarian tasting menu!  Get the 7 course veggie tasting as a full menu, or choose dishes from it to incorporate into your 4-5 course choices.

Adding the optional wine pairings for any of the pre-fixed menus is a sure fire way to take this meal to the next level because La Toque holds Wine Spectator's highest award for excellence.

Truly something for everyone!  If you find yourself lucky enough to be dinning when it is Truffle season, you can enjoy their amazing truffle sandwich or even a full truffle Chefs tasting menu.  Chef Ken Frank has an amazing way with both black & white truffles!

Each dining experience takes about 2-4 hours depending on how many courses & how fast you eat.  I highly recommend making reservations, but they do accept walk-ins as well. Valet Parking is validated by the restaurant, there is a coat check and a full bar available.  You can also eat at a special table in the kitchen, where the magic happens, at the chef's table.<//text>< Pics>

<Review>I would have given La Toque 1/4 of a star if that was possible.  Their website boasts Michelin star cuisine but their service is far from a Michelin star.  I recently celebrated my birthday dinner at La Toque and my wife and I enjoyed their tasting menu, paired with a variety of wines.  The food and wine was fantastic.  After receiving the check, our server accidentally spilled the remaining wine from my wife's glass all over her white dress.  We did not make a fuss in order to avoid the server getting into trouble.  The manager came over and told us she would pay for our dry cleaning and gave us her card.  When we told her we are from out of town, she just said, "you can send the bill from anywhere in the country and I will take care of it."  When I asked the manager if she felt dry cleaning was an acceptable way to resolve an unfortunate birthday and dining experience, she replied, "I heard you spilled the wine on your wife...I am going on the information I was told."  I would expect this response from the counter supervisor at a fast food joint, not from a manager representing a Michelin star restaurant.  Would I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a fine dining experience?  No.  However, I would suggest the management of La Toque require their entire team undergo some basic training in service and hospitality.  You cannot advertise to serve Michelin star food if your service is as good or less than what you get at the local drive thru.<//Review>< name>

<Text>Great food, worth a Michelin star. Unfortunately the staff, while attentive to details, was not welcoming at all and seemed to be very unhappy with what they were doing.

Overall it made us feel quite bad for being there, which I find unacceptable in a restaurant, not to mention one with a Michelin star.</Text>< Pictures>

I've been to over 30 Michelin star restaurants. This is is not Michelin star food. However,  my family and I had a nice time. We had one really exceptional dish (veal chop) and the people working there were really friendly.

In addition, we ordered a (very expensive) 2008 wine from California. We were unfamiliar with the fires that affected a lot of the wine at that time. Our sommelier failed to mention this until after we asked if the wine was possibly bad. It would have been really helpful to have brought this up when we were ordering.</Text>

We went to La Toque, as I had such a great experience there 6 years ago. Michelin star restaurant, known for it's wine parings. We ordered the 5 course meal, and chose our courses. The Chef's table was below the counter level of the kitchen so we couldn't see anything except the dirty dish parade from the dining room to the dishwasher. The decor was two brown plastic place mats. the food was just ounces per serving, the wines were unknown and unremarkable short pours, there was not even garnish on some of the dishes, the service was average, and the bill was over the top and accompanied by a 20% service charge, just under $300.00!!!</Text>

Impeccable service, especially Becky, the sommelier. Randy, the waiter had a bit of 'tude, but after a word, all was fine, especially when spending $2K for dinner, and advising that the restaurant confirmed 4 times in the week of the reservation of dietary restrictions. They'd better have a vegan option if you're not allowing me to bring in a vegan dessert. Balance of wait staff was exceptional. Tasting menu was delicious on a 5 course menu, which included vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian, omnivore. Wine pairings were adequate, but not exceptional. We  ordered 3 additional bottles off their exceptional and diverse wine list. We'd come back here, even if not a hotel guest.<//review>

<review>This is my first Michelin star experience. First of all, the plates are really tiny, as people were talking about. Each dish is meticulously prepared, and the presentation is nice. La Toque offers a 9 course chef recommended dinner, or a 4 to 5 course build your own type of dinner. The 9 course easily runs you about $250 per person (with wine). I had the 4 course dinner. I ordered a Cappacio (raw beef), duck breast, rib eye steak and a chocolate dessert. I would say the steak is the best, the duck and raw beef was OK. The service was nice, very attentive and polite. There are about 3 people serving us for the night. The total comes to about $250 for 2. Is the food amazing? Probably not. I have had better duck, beef and steak elsewhere. You are mostly paying for the experience.<//review>< pics>

Embarrassingly slow service. Luke warm food! Not the Michelin star we were expecting at all! As Napa locals we were EXTREMELY disappointed. Worst dining experience in the valley!

UPDATE: The restaurant contacted us and said that their Thanksgiving dinner (which is when we went) was not their usual food or service. It was done at the request of their patrons and definitely overbooked! The manager nicely compensated us to our satisfaction so we will return to try it out again.<//Review>

<Text>The low rating is merely because the cost of the food does not go well with the quality of the food experience. No doubt, the food is awesome! But unfortunately it is extremely overpriced for what it is.

One tip- food is super salty, ask if they can do low sodium on their seasoning.</Text>< time>

2. Horrible servicea.  We were sit to the window and forgotten.  After waved at a waitress,  he was obviously annoyed.
3. Food is mediocre at best
4. It took over 15 minutes for one dish to show up.  Could not find a waitress to ask.  Finally waived down one, she was obviously not happy
4. They charge you a service charge (tip) for a reason: if they did not force me, I will not pay any tips.
5. Do not go there ever<//Review>< user>

Happened to find this place on a short trip to Napa Valley and loved it.  The atmosphere is relaxing and offers an upscale feel without feeling over formal, the staff were attentive, and the food was easily worth the price.  We were almost put off by the offer of only a chef's menu but there are sufficient and varied choices at each level to guarantee everyone will be able to find something they really like.  We happened to find the four course perfect for the two of us.  We are not dessert people but it would have been a shame to miss that course.  And it is so nice to experience fine dining in a an establishment where you can readily hold a conversation because you can hear.   A perfect end to that part of our trip.</Text>

The youthful yet knowledgeable staff made every effort to make our experience memorable. The kitchen is consistent with timing and quality, while the portions are perfectly balanced and adventurous.  The modest-contemporary interior is comfortable and clean, with an emphasis on local, in-season ingredient sourcing that inspires me to revisit during times other than wine harvest and crush.</review>

One of the most disappointing experiences I’ve ever had. My wife and I had the chefs tasting menu with wine pairings, and were one of only five tables served all night. The place was vacant, playing dated music which was not appropriate for the setting. A glass was broken at our table - we were asked to stand and wait as they cleaned it. The service was awful - we were left waiting for long periods of time often, and the manager was quite unpleasant when we wanted compensation for our experience. After only offering the tip as a comp, we were beside ourselves. While we planned our honeymoon time in Napa around this restaurant, we regret it 100%. We have had better service at an Olive Garden.<//text>

It was a great dining experience. The staff were very friendly and helped us with an introduction before the start of every new item we tasted. Food was great. Don't be fooled by the quantity. We ordered the vegetable tasting menu and enjoyed every round. Thanks to Maria who was the main person taking care of our table and to the entire staff that supported her.

Mr. Propreitor Chef - I really wanted to meet you. I was told that you were spending time with your family on Tuesdays, which is very important. Thank you for the excellent menu on the vegetarian side.

Visited La Toque in December 2016 and is still recalling how terrible it was. I’ve had better bar food and was in essence served ants on log - terrible flavor combinations all and all. Don’t eat here. This is where your go to be let down when the French Laundry won’t take your reservation last minute.< /Review>

Not worth the money, get into French Laundry if you can for a TRUE "gourmet" experience. La Toque allows people to wear flip flops, jeans, and t-shirts and has a "hotel restaurant" feel to it. Very expensive, $150+/person, but short on the experience...< /review>

Not worthy of a Michelin Star.  We had the worst experience at La Toque.  Went to celebrate our engagement and ordered a multi-course meal with wine pairing.  Without asking permission, the restaurant decided to replace a duplicate wine pairing with Champagne- which doesn't agree with my fiance.  When we noticed the Champagne we asked for it to be replaced with another wine.  The Sommelier, in the most unprofessional, rude and condescending tone said "Oh, I guess you didn't notice the champagne glass on the table before I poured it."  This nastiness and pettiness from the Sommelier was SHOCKING- for any service experience let alone a $600 meal.  We told the manager on duty and they replaced the Sommelier for the remaining course; however, our experience was already ruined.  We were given a bottle of wine to try to mitigate for the experience - which living 3,000 miles away doesn't really mean anything to us because we can't travel with the wine.  Two days later, after reflecting on how poor our experience was, we went back to the restaurant to speak with the General Manager.  He could have not been more rude.  Did not apologize.  Told us the issue was "handled."  And then TOOK THE BOTTLE OF WINE BACK and walked away!

We both thought the food was delicious; however, service is a key factor to a fine dining experience and it does not matter how delicious the food is when the service was so abysmal.  Shame on you La Toque for ruining our entire experience.

I hope this restaurant loses it's Michelin star.  They are not worthy of the designation.  It's bad enough to have a one-off bad experience with a Sommelier but the follow-up by management was even more rude and more upsetting.

The owner's response is to recklessly and maliciously call us "bullies" and "jerks." How about owning up to your staff verbally abusing a guest? And perhaps you should look through the aggregate of your reviews on Google, Trip Advisor, Yelp and Facebook because many other guests share my view of your service.< /text>

<Resp>{'time': 1537927456200, 'text': 'As always, there are two sides to every story. One little hiccup with a glass of Champagne should not ruin an entire experience, unless someone is just hell bent on being unhappy. Our Manager and our Wine Director went above and beyond to make it up to them, giving them extra pairing pours, and adding dessert wine pairings. Noticing that they particularly enjoyed a Barbera that we were pouring, we also gifted them a full bottle to enjoy during their stay. For the remainder of their dinner experience they were very complimentary of the food and service. After the guests departed they decided that our efforts weren’t enough. The guests complained to the Hotel’s Front Desk numerous times, and then two days later returned to the restaurant with the gifted bottle of wine in hand. They then threatened to “trash” us on the internet unless we comped all of the wine off their bill, which is essentially extortion. We don’t negotiate with bullies. They then returned the bottle of wine to the Manager stating that they did not want to pay to ship it home. We have a great reputation and a great staff that take excellent care of our guests. But some of our guests turn out to be jerks and we can’t change that.'}< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
VERY disappointing!  This place is located in the Westin Resort in Napa--and looks the part (exactly like a hotel restaurant).

Service was slow--we had to wait unacceptably long periods (several times) while our server seemed to not know we were waiting for our next course, even though the sommelier had already poured our next wine pairing. When asked, she seemed annoyed.

We are not "newbies" to fine cuisine and excellent service: while the food was good, it was not of the outstanding level we expected at a "Michelin Star" restaurant in the Napa Valley.

The bill included a 20% service charge-- I was unable to identify anything about the service that was worth some $160 alone--the service was no better (and no more labor intensive) than I would receive at ANY restaurant.  Why should expensive food automatically result in a larger tip for the server, anyway?

Update:  see management's response-- it's all our fault? Even McDonald's knows "the customer is always right"...  this attitude is why the service was so poor....< /Review>

{'time': 1540165952746, 'text': "I am so sorry you were disappointed with your experience here at La Toque.  You ordered our Chef's Table Tasting Menu.  This menu is 11 courses long (with amuses) and we typically allow 3 to 4 hours for dining at a relaxed pace.  The menu is designed to be savored and enjoyed over that period of time.\nYou stated that you waited for long periods of time between courses.  Your reservation was at 7:00 and when you informed us partway through your meal that you needed to be finished by 9:00 because you had a car waiting, we did our best to move things along at speed.  Your main courses were on the table at 8:50, less than two hours after you began your meal.\nYou mention that the sommelier had poured your wine and you had to wait for the next course.  That is the typical order for service.  We pour the wine first, then the food is served.  There are pauses between the two.\nLastly, you stated that you paid $160.00 in a service charge.  This, like the rest of your claims, is inflated.  The service charge for your dinner that evening was $134.00.  You asked why expensive food should result in a larger tip?  It based on percentages. We add a 20% service charge to all menus.  That percentage is pretty standard for a high-end restaurant. All of that money does not go to the waiter alone.  Our service charge goes to all of the staff on the floor front waiters, back waiters, sommeliers and it is shared by the kitchen as well.  All service charges are pooled.\nIn the future, to avoid being disappointed with the pacing of your dinner, you should inform the host or your waiter that you have a timeline that you need to stick to.  They can then help steer you to the appropriate dining experience."}<//Response>

<rate>5</rate><Text>Apparently known as the mini French Laundry La toque is certainly in the same class, except the portions are American French not French. The food is excellent and the service is almost completely impeccable with very minor and occasional infractions: I noticed 2 approaches from the wrong side and an asynchronous dish delivery in a party of four diners eating four courses each. The red meat was prepared exactly properly, of fine cuts, including a mild lamb and tender antelope, with the carpaccio being notably exceptional in a fantastic group. The sea food dishes: Lobster linguini - very good-, the squid ink  scallop -masterful- , and himachi -excellent- were all of exceptional quality fish. The Sommelier was able to formulate a rare and novel, but very excellent cocktail on request to vague taste guidelines, and offer helpful suggestions to wine taste requests to fit within the half bottle list as well as curb side education on up and coming wine regions. I am constantly disappointed by Sommelier service but was very pleased here by the red headed female Sommelier whose name I regretfully cannot recall. I would certainly revisit La toque and rank it easily in my top ten fine dining experiences at #3.< /Text></record>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The food is really delicious, but the service and especially the wine list prices is unnecessary. Wines in any restaurant are expected to be more expensive, but in this restaurant it is around 5 times more, ridiculous. You have the option to choose the menu with wine in this case it is noticed that the wines are the cheapest on the menu. Too bad the restaurant was quite empty.

(Original)
A comida é realmente muito deliciosa, mas o atendimento e principalmente os preços da carta de vinhos é algo desnecessário. Vinhos em qualquer restaurante se espera ser mais caro, porém neste restaurante é algo em torno de 5 vezes à mais, ridículo. Tem opção de escolher o menu com vinho neste caso se percebe que os vinhos são os mais baratos do menu. Uma pena tanto que o restaurante estava bem vazio.< /Review></record>

<Review>Since I arrive to San Diego every body is been talking to the pizza California stile! Been trying some places and then a friend told me about Pizza Port.

Highly recommend, for my is the best Pizza in San Diego, we just try the cheese pizza, thanks to my kids, but is really good !

This is also a brewery in San Diego and they have a very good beer, the one that I love is Shark Bite brown ale!! Awesome!

The staff were really friendly!!

Good work guys!!<//Review>< Name>

The staff was extremely friendly and the business was very clean and spaced everyone apart from each other. We absolutely loved this place and will visit it when we return to California!<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHdejBO-7SG8GuyLqq02cHmK7hUzjZzvr9O7Vl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< resp>

I give the food five stars but the lame service gets three.
The blonde has now kept me waiting for my food twice. I order, hang out and enjoy a beverage and they are to call me when food is ready to go...nope, not her. She never even checked. Had to get some of the food redone since it sat so long..</Text>

<Review>At this Italian restaurant, I had the best and tastiest spaghetti with meatballs. We had lunch with my friends here yesterday and it was my first time at a restaurant. My first time here, they never disappointed as I tasted their delicious pasta and beverages. With a touch of sophistication, the atmosphere was very classical.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Name>Zachary Harms< /Name><review>Excellent beer selection, whether you prefer a lighter beer,  IPA’s or stouts they’ll have it here. My wife and I ordered a pepperoni pizza with an imperial stout and coffee Porter. Pizza was decent but I would come back for the beer and outstanding service. Great brewery and really close to Ocean bean which is another plus.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><time>1618798780175<//time>< GmapID>

Amazing pizza and beer! Good COVID safety. Love that they turned the parking lot into outdoor seating. We always travel with a dog and it's been hard to find seating outside in the past.</text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>This place was recommended by a friend who used to live in the area. It truly was a "religious experience"! This place ranks up in the top 3 pizza joints I've ever been to in the world. Their beer is also fantastic. Prices are incredibly reasonable; I got 2 small deluxe pizzas, a pint, 2 sodas, a salad, and a pint of house made ice cream for 45 bucks. Can't beat that!<//text><Time>1559365974688< /Time>< resp>

< Review>
It’s a family-owned restaurant, with friendly service and homestyle cooking, Their pizzas are quite popular at dinner, but In my opinion, they outshine at breakfast. Also, the waiters are very helpful and attentive. The prices are very reasonable too. We will come back and recommend to all of my relatives!</Review>

< Review>
pizza port, I love it. Go here all the time with the fam and it never gets old. The pizza is the best and Pizza port always has an interesting beer on tap. That's the main attraction to me because I am a drinking man for sure. Keep on keeping it real y'all much respect.< /Review>

<rating>3</rating><review>We went on a Thursday night in April 2021 at 7:30pm and it was over an hour to receive a pizza. We waited in a line for 15 minutes just to get to the “place order here” sign. This line was sort of socially distanced but not really bc the line went out the door and ppl were crowding inside to not be out in the cold.

The place WAS PACKED with customers. It looked pre-pandemic in here. If you’re not scared of Covid, this is the place for you.</review>< pics>

The food was okay. Pizza was very soppy and soggy, but not in a bad way. Just not my style. There’s a LOT of cheese. The specials are cool and there’s a great beer selection (that I unfortunately didn’t get to try). Very cool atmosphere and decor, somehow very flexible and good for both families and friends/bar hopping. I’d come back but maybe get a different meal haha. The salad was great, pizza not my style.<//text>

Awesome place I love it here. Even though it's always hard to find a parking spot.  Great staff, customer service and excellent pizzas. So many choices of pizza and beer.  My favorite imperial stout Santa Little Helper with the Simpson on my mind. Nice chilled environment great to hang with friends too. Mini arcade there as well and clean bathroom.  Come for a sunset and swing in here.</review>

Beer selection is great. Pizza is ok, kinda doughy for my taste, I prefer a crispier crust so I’d order a pizza well done next time. They have outside seating for you to drink a beer while you wait for your togo order.< /Review>

<review>The beer is some of the best in San Diego, which is a high compliment in this beer town. The pizza is also really good. There are a lot of pizzas, including several veggie options. You can also get it normal or thin crust style. The service is friendly. It's counter service, not table service, which feels especially good in these covid times. They are also doing a good job with safety protocols, keeping people distant, limiting the number of people, etc. That means you might have a wait during busy times, but well worth the wait!< /review><name>Gabe Garcia< /name>< rate>

We called ahead to avoid the crowd and the wait for the food. Got the all meet and the Roma, both were delicious. The service was good although they get real busy so expect to wait and may be ignored. They currently have all dining in the patio and in their parking lot.  So parking in the area is a little tough and you're probably going to need to look for street parking. Overall the food was very good.</Review>< UserId.>

<Text>Excellent Pizza Port Ocean Beach with interesting combos.  Fresh garlic with the garlic bread.  They have cheap PBRs too.  We came right after work on a weeknight, so there was plenty of space.  Will try again!< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<Review>Great taps. The food looked really good. I was here on vacation up find Pliny the elder. I would come back for sure. It seems like it'd be a fun place to hang out. Bench tables to sit at. Enough of a family atmosphere. Definitely give it a try.</Review><userid>109324671510610769627</userid><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHSp5Ne2uFxOfc-HP0VlK_4E3YQGF-hzGLkoV1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIWspYWfuNPzqT2aQyNVRP2KxoIZu3_aHOIxlB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdaUc4a7cKx8WTadwnVE7QC3q47cUF3btVFTwI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNo_z-3Aj2xLI6H4QOj2gCU9JNkasXm8rr0jBwS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPs5TlQw6Q5fIEAINJHBkRV60bwfFl-KUH8WQ2j=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuKd_2a8DZwLSLCjfC2zR2eRJPBdOcJ_gxF9qR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnFuqz9DlfExr6R91QSYlumVviP_75Ab3SyW6b=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9Wlu5vaAr60-L48IwDEYpxA607Wyi70SIPbg3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnXRlvu3jP2Ey6bZVGygm0vhAOkiGffOz6zoKJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtg0n8WPYcBn7YRbyFXVgD-SO5g9T9LI502uoH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< date>

Yummy pizza in a relaxed (& bustling) atmosphere! I loved the simple cheese pizza and my family loved the huge selection of craft beer! A great spot to be able to sit and enjoy pizza while being able to grab our own drinks and enjoy one another’s company.<//Review>

The service is super fast and friendly! We got the veggie basket and large pizza. The dough was really good although the pizza was alright nothing to write home about. They definitely had good variety of beer, pizza and other appetizers.</text>

Outdoor seating was nice, Pizza was not, ordered a garlic veggie pizza that had no taste of garlic and another pizza that tasted strong of blue cheese but was not supposed to have blue cheese on it. Pizza was good, just not as menu described...<//Text>

Good pizza place.  I ordered wings and the clam and shrimp pizza, both were really good.  Service was great.  Dog friendly (they even provided a bowl and bottled water for the dog).  They have turned their parking lot into out door seating to accommodate the required social distancing, it works really well.</text>

1st time here, LOVED IT!!! I'm from Chicago and have a high standard of pizza, this place exceeded my expectations. The fact that they have amazing beer is the cherry on the sundae..I will visit every time I'm in town.</Review>

So the beer here is obviously a must and they have great prices on flights so you should totally get those.

Some of the pizzas are great and others are not though. I’ve found that if I specialize my pizza it’s way better. A plain pepperoni or cheese isn’t all that great but if you double the cheese it’s awesome! The buffalo chicken is probably the best one- it’s awesome all by itself.

Really cool atmosphere and definitely a place you can bring big groups of people because they have super large picnic style tables.

dog friendly.</Text>

If I could find a way to move into the OB Pizza Port, I would do it. This place is surprisingly great pizza, amazing San Diego style craft beer, and a family friendly location in Ocean Beach. Plus, you can bring your pup!
I also have to point out that the staff are some of the nicest people in the business. This place is perfect.</review>

Burma Superstar has good food and a nice atmosphere. But the wait is just not worth it when there are other great Burmese places within walking distance. If you don't mind waiting, this is a good experience, but Mandalay on California has just as good if not better food, and is a short walk away, without nearly as much wait.<//Text>

Great lunch prices/combos. And always offer a $3 pint and a $4 pint. Both were delicious today, juicy j for 3 wasn't super juicy but champagne-esque very nice on a hot day and the other was ob haze for $4, citrusy, juicy hazy. Very crushable.</text>

Huge variety of beer on tap. Best pizza in San Diego, specially the one with artichoke and pepperoni. Opens till late night, so it’s a really good choice to go after a long day walking around the city.< /Text>

We were visiting from Chicago and thoroughly enjoyed the three pizzas we tried. The ingredients were fresh, and the pizza was flavorful. The environment seemed very fun and vibrant--we took our pizza to go, so we didn't try any of the beer, but the list was extensive. The most interesting pizza we had was the San Clemente. We also had the Bacon Cheeseburger and Garlic Veggie. I would be happy to eat any of these pizzas again!< /Review>

My friends and I started day drinking at just 30 minutes past noon. Our friend hit it hard and passed out and we thought pizza could save him, and while he didn’t wake up, this pizza certainly saved us. We were pleasantly surprised as this was our first time eating here, and we were genuinely impressed by the service, quality of food, and how fast we got it. 10/10.< /Review>

Pizza slices are HUGE and the beer is good. Came in the afternoon and got their lunch special which was pretty reasonably priced. There is plenty of seating inside and although it was a bit crowded, my group of 6 found a place to sit. Employees are extremely courteous and accommodating, will come back for lunch soon!<//text>

Delicious pizza and suds! We beat the Sunday crowd by getting there at 5pm. It was busy by 6pm, but the food came out quick enough for us, but appetizers helped. There's a food only line on the right. Food and brew line to the left. Ask for samples of their brews.
Pizza was nice and doughy, but not thick like pan pizza, not too thin either. Loads of toppings!!!
The Carlsbad was outstanding... hope you like artichoke, pesto and feta😉. BBQ cheeseburger had meatballs, not ground beef, I liked it more than I thought I would. I was expecting weird, but the meatballs made it seem more traditional.
Wings were baked, not bready. (The way i like it)
We got the veggie basket as a side, it was ideal for a family of 4 or two really hungry people.
For you beer bodies, they offer cans, growlers, and 6 packs to go.
There's a small parking lot adjacent and there's a pay to park across the street. If you want free parking, plan on street parking and walking a block or two.</text>

<review>Pizza was excellent. Beer was awesome. The lines were quite long, and with 15 or 20 people in line together inside to order it was confusing how safe that could be. Not the fault of Pizza Port, just an observation.  I'd still go back though!<//review><resp>None<//resp>< Rating>

<text>Chaotic fun pizza place that is very family-friendly. Long family style tables that are congenial to meeting people. It was pretty crowded when I was there which was why I said it was chaotic but we still got our pizza in a very reasonable amount of time. Huge beer selection. Pizza was good.<//text><Response>None< /Response>< date>

<text>Killer pizza! This place does not disappoint. Dropped in with a group of college friends who were staying in Ocean Beach.

Pizza Port has a very chilled, laid-back vibe. We were quickly able to find a long table that accommodated our group. Note, that the tables are shared, so don't be afraid to chat up your neighbor.

Pizza took about 35 mins to bake, and we enjoyed few rounds of beer while waiting, along with the jalapeno poppers (highly recommend!). We tried the Garlic Veggie Pizza w/ traditional crust. Super fresh veggies and gooey cheese.

We will defiantly be back on our next trip to SD!</text>< pics>

<Review>Yummy. The food never disapoints. We got two small pizzas,  wings and a veggie basket along with Swamis beer.  Everything was cooked exactly how we had hoped. We love taking pizza port to the cliffs to enjoy a mini picnic. The carlsbad is my favorite pizza.  Very different with the pesto, sun dried tomato, chicken, artichokes and feta cheese. The flavor bursts in your mouth. Every bite seems to have a slightly different flavor. When you get all the components on one piece...WOW.  My boyfriend prefers a more classic meaty pizza. The sausage was delicious.</Review><gmap_id>0x80deaa3a261cd2e3:0x3e89464c53bf352<//gmap_id><username>Kelly Hernandez<//username>< Pics>

THEY FINALLY HAVE VEGAN CHEESE!!! Now I can enjoy a full pizza with all my friends. Thank you!

Always good pizza, good beer selection, and now a vegan- and allergen-friendly selection for those who don't eat dairy.<//Review>

A staple amongst the many amazing breweries in San Diego. Really enjoyed some of the beers and the laid back ambiance. Was also very pumped to find Pliny the Elder on tap. Great service as well, highly recommended.<//Review>

<GmapID>0x80deaa3a261cd2e3:0x3e89464c53bf352< /GmapID><Text>I have been a fan of Pizza Port for many years. They keep the menu simple with pizza, salad, breadsticks, mozzarella sticks, and buffalo chicken wings and craft beer and soda and iced tea. I love all their food and they have lunch specials, like two slices and a drink or a slice, salad, and a beverage (non-alcoholic), and a couple other options. You can substitute a beer for an additional charge. They have the proper social distancing protocols on keeping your mask on when you are not seated at your table. You have to ask for napkins, utensils, parmesan cheese, or red pepper flakes.
The service is friendly and helpful. I fully recommend this Pizza Port in Ocean Beach, San Diego.
The toughest part about the Ocean Beach (OB) location is parking is scarce. Especially with the social distancing protocols in place, they took over the small 7 parking spot lot for outdoor dining.</Text>< user>

< Review>
One of the older pizza port locations. This family friendly restaurant is always loud and full of energy, but this create that ambiance. Outstanding beer selection which includes pizza port beers as well as local breweries and collaborations. Good specials on beers they want to move. Pizza is pretty good too!< /Review>

<Text>Love this place!  The pizza is really good.  The crust is fluffy and perfect.  The atmosphere is very relaxed.  You go to the counter to order your pizza and beer, grab a seat and relax.  They have their own beer which is great and also have a rotating selection of other brews as well.</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNii1CYiIcYQg-T9n9Z7LIusl6BdaUENqQH3HJk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< response>

I love this place and they have a nice environment, even now when they have to seat everyone outside due to Covid-19. I only take a star off because their pizza is not as good as I remember.</Text>

<rate>3</rate><Review>The beer buddies were super good with our beers. The price in the area can't be beat. If you get the $3 pints and a small pizza and some beer buddies it's a perfect meal for two. This is a favorite for us for date night! Love their chronic ale, easily my favorite.
----------------Editted a few months later-----------------

Edit: From five to three stars for super rude staff. First I tried to order slices and the bartender told me they weren't doing slices so I ordered two small pizzas. Before my order came up I watched several people order and pick up individual slices. So I then had two small pizzas and needed some to-go boxes. They normally have them sitting out to help yourself. They didn't have any available so I requested two boxes from the staff. The busser said to me "two boxes? Why do you need two boxes?" I explained I had two pizzas but he retorted with "uh huh." I allowed my -well over 21- boyfriend to sample my beer (he didn't want one but wanted to try it) and we had the busser inform us that he couldn't taste my drink without getting ID'ed by the bartender and then said if he saw it again he would "have to bounce us". Asking for an ID would have sufficed. He absolutely did not need to treat us like we were breaking the law. This is a brewery, you have to assume people will sample each other's drinks. It's not accepted to threaten to remove someone from the property over it without requesting an ID first.

I don't know if they were recently hit with a fine or what but this behavior is a little wild. This place has been a favorite of ours for years and the entire atmosphere totally flipped. I hope that this trend doesn't continue because it makes it extremely uncomfortable to dine and relax.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgqr1ia3e42xe7M-kDoUDFu_sVOVGjHsS6rf0i=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Response>

Pizza Port is an awesome hangout spot with delicious pizza (lots of custom options) & beers/ales/ciders. It can get pretty crowded at times & the seating is far more casual than most other places you'd go, but it's perfect for group hangouts. I love the ambiance.<//review>

Good beer, pizza and vibes. Don't remember what beer I ordered but it was a blonde ale and it was good. Ordered a San Francisco pizza and enjoyed. This was my son and I's first stop once we landed on his first visit to San Diego.<//text>

Pizza port is great. The pizza is next level good. The crust in fluffy and thick. There are plenty of creative pizzas you can order or you can make your own. The apps are delicious, grab some beer buddies! Speaking of beer, they brew their own amazing beer in house. Try some!</Review>

It captures the spirit of the area so well - surf, beer, and a loose and casual feel. Just a little off the main drag, it's within easy reach for tired surfers and rubbernecks alike, and makes a fine choice when Hodad's is running a line around the corner.

First, I've really only had the pizza. And it's good, competing with NY Slice style pizza around San Diego (East Coasters might turn their nose up at the place, FWIW.) I've also sampled the kale salad which was inappropriately healthy given the settings. The real treat here is the beer, which is always diverse, experimental, affordable, and delicious. Pizza Port's social media game has been overshadowed by newer players, but the brewing and taste is still on point, and matches supremely with the pizza available.

Head in during the lunch special and get away with two slices and a beer for less than $10, then get back to the beach with your newly acquired gut. Or return to the main street and go shopping, if you can resist the temptation to nap.<//Text><Rating>5< /Rating><gmap_id>0x80deaa3a261cd2e3:0x3e89464c53bf352<//gmap_id><username>Garrett Bredell<//username></record>

WARNING: Do NOT place orders via ChowNow.

I've been a regular at the OB and Solana Beach Pizza Port locations since childhood.

Yesterday, I placed an order online for pickup at the OB Pizza Port via ChowNow.  I arrived 15 minutes after receiving the notification that the food was ready.  Due to an error between the shop and ChowNow, my order was never received so I waited for it to be prepared (outside, standing on the curb due to COVID restrictions) after being quoted 15 minutes.  30 minutes later, I checked on the progress and was informed that I had been made the incorrect pizza and that they would finish the one I ordered in 10 minutes.  One hour after I initially arrived to pick up my food, I finally received what I ordered.

The women who served me were very kind and offered the incorrectly-made pizza for free in addition to what I ordered, which I really appreciated.  Unfortunately, because I had to wait an hour to receive my order, my girlfriend missed a seminar she needed to attend.  Going forward, I unfortunately won't be providing my business to the OB location.<//text>

< Review>
Great pizza, cheese sticks and Mac and cheese. It's a very bar type of ambiance, but there were beer drinkers (watching football) and an equal number of families with kids. Great service as well (mostly paper plates and self serve, but the counter staff was super friendly and helpful). Order at the cashier and grab a table.... Wait for them to call your name!</Review>

Wow! Almost passed it up because we generally don't like crowded places.. So glad we didn't! We will probably return everytime we come out to San Diego. We got the twice baked wings and Monterey pizza and were definitely not disappointed! Not to mention the amazing beer they have. 😍🍺<//text>

<Time>1567466541953</Time><Review>Visiting and needed a place to grab food and relax a little after visiting the zoo. Pizza Port fit the bill and was friendly and welcoming. My girlfriend was indecisive on which beer she wanted and they were generous enough to give us both plenty of tastings. Their beers were good and the variety of guest beers was excellent. The pizza was well done, not overly greasy like some can be and had a tasty crust.  We also ordered a salad which was decent. Better than many other pizza joints but not gourmet level.< /Review><UserId.>109925457418000128828<//UserId.>< pics>

I've become a port fan over the year. A single slice vs a fresh pie is the reason for 1 less star. The pies come out a little thicker compared to a slice. I've never understood why they are different. They have the best prices for beer, slice and salad. If you haven't been give it a try.<//review>

Great atmosphere for all ages! Plenty of beer choices on tap, and the pizza is delicious. A lot of seating inside and there is a patio outside. You'll find families with toddlers to younger couples having a great time. Definitely worth a visit when you're in OB!< /Review>

Pizza Port is an awesome communal lively food and beer garden that I would be happy to frequent if I lived in the area. Instead I'll just frequent it every time I come to town. The pizza is wonderful the beer is flavorful and strong and the environment is very very welcoming.<//Review>

<rate>5</rate><Review>People should know that pizza port has great pizza, buy the slice or whole and great beer. They always have lunch a lunch special you get pizza and a salad and soda for $6 something and if you don't want the soda  you can get a beer for $1 off or try there beer specials usually have a $3 beer special and a $4 beer special. We were there today and had the lunch special and a great IPA for a great price. I recommend you check them out. Can't go wrong.</Review><username>Kathleen Kothman</username><Time>1553476804065</Time><gmap_id>0x80deaa3a261cd2e3:0x3e89464c53bf352</gmap_id><userid>110235209945674156873</userid><Response>None</Response>< Pictures>

Great pizza, even better beer, and there is always a place to sit, even when it’s busy (which it almost always is). If you enjoy either, I highly recommend you make the trip.

<resp>None<//resp><Time>1576568340199</Time><review>It was okay. I was disappointed because I took my kids here SPECIFICALLY to have some of their house-made root beer and when I ordered it, was told that the machine was broken. Oddly enough, that was the same story I got when I visited the Solana Beach location a couple of years ago. Regardless, if they're not going to offer an item, I think that the menu board should note that it's not available. Also, I ordered the lunch special and when I told the clerk what type of pizza I wanted, she replied that the only options were cheese, pepperoni, or the pizza of the day. The menu board says "any slice pizza" - again, if it's only certain types of pizza that are available with the special, then the menu should note that, not say "Any." I ordered the pizza of the day and it was yummy. It was hot and fresh, and the servings were large. The orders came out in a reasonable amount of time. If you're not a regular, it's a little unclear what you're supposed to do after you're finished eating - bus your own table? Leave it there? Some signage would help with that too. All in all, it was an ok experience. I wouldn't drive out of my way to go there again (like I did this time) and circle the block again & again looking for parking, but if I was already in the area, I'd eat there.</review></record>

I am going to give this place at 4 stars because the service is amazing and the pizza is really good. They have a lot of very interesting combinations and their vegetarian options particularly good. The beer is really good too.The only downside is the seating and how loud it can get nside the actual restaurant. Other than that, yeah definitely worth the trip.< /Review>

Pizza is good. Beer selection is great. Lunch deal is best in town. Only draw back is it gets a little noisy and beer quantity restrictions prevent you from buying a round for friends. You all have to get up and get in line.< /Text>

I like this location a lot, and visit every time I'm in San Diego. The beers & pizza always satisfy, and the beach-side town casual vibe works. I would just note that my last visit was more like a scene from Chuck E Cheese, so choose your day & time of day accordingly!</Review>

If you're meeting anyone here, make sure your arrive a little early...  The parking can be a bit difficult at times.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

The prices are very acceptable. The place it's cool and nice, the 'Monterey' pizza 👌🏼perfect.
You can play music of your choice in a digital jukebox, they have artesanal beer, terraza, tv with sport shows. Cool place</review>

We enjoy coming here for the fun vibes! It's a fun family friendly pizza place with several rows of long picnic tables and a large (wonderful) beer selection. Super laid back and can get crowded especially on weekends but they do have pizza by the slice lunch specials which is nice and usually quick.<//text>

Kinda disappointed.  I love their chronic amber ale but not impressed with the pizza or apps.   Too much cheese on pizza.  We got Hawaiian but maybe should have stuck with traditional pizza.   Awesome shirts for purchase & arcade.</text>

One of my favorite places in San Diego! Amazing (and always changing) beer selection! Delicious and fresh pizza! They also have vegan options (if that’s your thing). BBQ Chicken pizza is dank and I’ve never been disappointed with their beer selection. I go here regularly. Every time I am in OB, I make it a point to stop by Pizza Port!<//Review>

Came here on a Tuesday night after hittin up a couple bars (one was a saloon type bar and the other a bbq spot). Got 3 huge slices of pizza for 8.50 which could have added up to almost a whole pizza. Its very hard for me to find a delicuous pizza spot that me and my GF like but this place was great. Delicious pizza.< /Text>

Pizza was nothing to write home about, pretty standard as pizza goes, not bad, but definitely not great. Their beer selection was good and a number of their own beers are quite good. One of the cashiers was kinda short and rude but the place was busy so maybe he was having a hard night. Definitely nothing special to make me come back here and wasn't worth finding parking for.<//Text>

Went here for the first time for dinner with a group of co-workers. Ordered the Pizza Lahaina, Pizza Laguna, and Pizza San Clemente (love the pizzas named after California beaches). Each pizza was more scrumptious than the next! I never would have believed that a pizza with black bean sauce as its base could be so good but it was a revelation. My favorite was the Lahaina, but I'm one of those people who likes pineapple on a pizza with Canadian bacon.

Great, laid-back atmosphere at this place. The next time I'm in San Diego, Pizza Port will be on the short-list of places to go!< /review>< Time>

Beer, beer, and more beer.   And by the way they have pizza too! We went here For a birthday celebration. We ordered about five pizzas which were all gourmet ranging from a vegetarian option to a garlic and meat combination.  There were games for the kids to play while we socialized with the adults. Super fun vibe and very good food. They had so many different kinds of beer available that it was mind blowing.  The food was out within 15 minutes of ordering it, the beer was cold, and the staff was on point. We will definitely be back</text>

Sone of the best IPAs in town, especially when its wet hop season. If your hungry order the pizza. The San Francisco pizza is my personal favorite and pairs nicely with a dank pizza port IPA.<//review>

Always good beer and good pizza at Pizza Port! I had only been to the San Clemente location before but OB's flights were cheaper and had some really great options. We loved the Flyin' Hawaiian. The pizza had lots of seasoning on it, which I enjoyed</text>

Greatest place on earth... Except for the plague of harassing flies on the patio... Impossible to enjoy food or drink out there if u have to swat them away every two seconds. What a drag. If they cleaned it up, wiped down the area regularly os whatever it takes, it would make this location 5 stars. Amazing brewery, delicious comfort food, good atmosphere, no pretentious attitudes, just a great and legendary local treasure.< /Text>

Two things, the pizza was delicious! The customer service was trash! If you want some ranch dressing with your pizza then expect attitude from the guy at the counter. The attitude was uncalled for and very humiliating. The pizza was so good that I reluctantly (because of the fear of getting attitudes) went twice in one week. You probably can't go wrong with any pizza on the menu.</review>

<review>The best Pizza Port location. It can get packed, but there is a good flow to the place, so it's never a problem. The pizza is one of the best in San Diego. My favorite is the veggie with added grilled chicken. Recently tried a specialty sausage and jalapeno that was impressive as well. The selection of beers never disappoints. Especially when they bring out the specialty casks, which often is around Beer Week or during their Anniversary, etc. Highly recommend. One of the best spots to grab a drink and bite in OB.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<Text>We loved this place! Our lyft driver was telling us how great it was before we even walked in the door, so they obviously have a following. They have tons of pizza options in addition to simple build-your-own and their traditional crust option really filling, almost like a colorado mountain pie style pizza. They also have a huge beer selection. The vibe is very casual and fun; we came in at like 9:30pm during a baseball game and on one side of us we had a big family with young kids watching the TVs and on the other side a big group of rowdy young guys who were playing a drinking game. Definitely a place for everyone!<//Text>< pics>

A consistent family favorite.  "California" style pizza is always delicious.

Excellent craft brew selection from lager to ale to IPA to Porter - all good.  Try the non-alcohol brewed root beer.  It all hits the spot.</Review>

This is hands down the best pizza in San Diego. They have they best pizza creations I've ever seen, and the best part is that they're all delicious.
In addition to making great pizza, they have a giant board with a wide variety of beers, some even brewed in house. They serve almost every type of beer. One glass per ID tho.<//Text>

<rate>3</rate><text>The pizza is really good (with some unconventional but tasty toppings - e.g. butternut squash) and the beer selection is excellent, but it took about 50 minutes to get ours after ordering with no notice it would take that long. Also the root beer was watery (the strong ale I got was sweeter). We arrived at 7pm Saturday evening. I would recommend going off main hours or when planning to wait a while (with some pitchers of whatever deal they have going). Under such conditions I might give 4 stars.< /text>< pics>

<review>If going with young children get there before 6:30. And bring dollars or coins for the super engaging and convenient game corner.  I love all the pizza. And the kale salad. And the root beer, which they will float for you if you ask.

Great deal for lunch:  2 slices and a beer.  Great location.  Great staff.  Especially the guy calling out orders that were ready.  He, and the beer, earn 5 stars alone.  Then add great pizza.</review>

Great for a crowd. Went for a birthday party with a group of six. We ordered individually and ordered too much food. Medium pies are quite large. They offer many different preset pizza options along with a create your own. We had the Mac and Cheese bites to start and they were good. Lots of video games and entertainment for the kids. Also a craft brewery on the premise. Very laid back experience. Order at the window and they call out your name to pick up the order. The announcer took some liberties with his announcements and created some smiles. Would go back with a crowd. Would not go by myself.< /Text>

I love their "wings" night on thursday's!  At 49 cents each it's a good deal, but it's only for "Dine In"  I would go early because it gets very busy and very crowded.  They are a very popular spot!  They're wings are great (though I've only tried a few different ones.)  I love their pizzas and the selection.  They can come up with some unusual combinations, but they're fun to try!  I hear (through people I go with and family members) that their beers are fantastic!  Great selection and reasonably priced.  I would recommend Pizza Port, but if you don't like crowds go on a week night (Monday or Tuesday) or during the week before 6pm.<//Text>

A fun and lively place. It was hard to find seating due to how packed it was. The margherita pizza was not cut well so the pieces would tear when I tried to pull one out and the tots were quite mushy. Had a good time with my friends.</review>

My friends make fun of me for how much I love this Pizza Port. Honestly though, it never fails to be delicious and satisfying. The beer list always has the best, most fresh selection. The people who work the bar are the friendliest dang people and actually know their beer and don’t just fake like they know it. If I could go here every night of my life and not gain weight, I would. Around 6 is definitely family time, but go after 7:30 and there’s plenty of room for people. They always have good games and events on! I really can’t express how much I love Pizza Port.</review>

<review>Nice family place, despite the beer focus. The beers my husband and I tried were fine, but not amazing. They have really nice prices though, and the pizza smelled great, though we didn't not actually try it. This place is dog friendly.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Rating>

Pretty good casual spot for a pizza and beer! The guy behind the bar was super friendly and nice. I’d stick to the pizzas as we had some Mac and Cheese bites to start and they were underwhelming to say the least. Batter isn’t very good, crumbed would have made them wayyyy better and tastier. Be willing to share tables with others as they are beer hall type benches to sit on.</Review>

<Text>I love the bressi ranch pizza. Pizza port has always been one of my favorite pizzas. The thick crust that is crunchy but soft, the sauce is fantastic. The different pizza styles are very well put together. There are great lunch speacials and the beer really sets the par for me.< /Text><name>Ian Hughes</name>< gmap_id>

Hands down my favorite pizza joint ever. Carlsbad location is great too, but to people watch & get that ocean air, this is the one. Delicious beer selection. My out of town guests always want to go here & good place for kids to chill with the family too. Or leave the rugrats with grandma & keep all the pizza to yourself. Better idea.< /review>

Food was amazing. We ordered the BBQ chicken pizza.came out quick and piping hot. Huge beer selection and the prices are fair. Definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone.<//Text>

Great beer, good pizza, communal tables format and a small bar. Video games and plenty of screens for sports and what not. Wing Wednesdays are a great deal</review>

Timing is everything coming here. A friend and I stopped by around 11 and it was quiet and calm. We got some food and drinks, but after about an hour kids were showing up. It is more family oriented so keep that in mind. Pizza and pretzels were nothing special, a little bland at times. But the garlic bread was delicious.</review>

Beer selection is on point and they sport many of their own homebrews. Just drink enough until you enjoy the pizza and this might be one of your favorite spots in OB!</Text>

Pizza port is relaxing place to have a good piece of pizza and a beer. They have many on draft,  And they change frequently. It's very close to the ocean and there's a large traffic for good people watching.</text>

Good pizza. Large selection. More expensive than most pizza restaurants. Really cool atmosphere. Very unique. Order your pizza at the counter and when it’s finished they will call you up to get your food. The wait varies on busyness. The seating is mostly long wooden indoor picnic tables, so during busy times, you have to be cool with sitting right next to strangers.</Review>

<text>Very tasty pizzas (the garlic veggie and bbq chicken are some of our favorites). The kale salad is surprisingly delicious. The mac n cheese bites were a bit of a let down, but the wings were good. They have a variety of beers on draft and occasionally a cider as well. It's a bit loud inside and the seating outside doesn't offer much of a view, but it's still a fun spot to check out and is very close to Ocean Beach. Parking nearby is a bit of a nightmare, but if your willing to pay or walk a few blocks you can easily find some.< /text>< pictures>

This is a good thing. Nothing fancy, pizza's certainly not outstanding, but this place has a beer selection....hoo ya! EXCELLENT environment. Overall, despite basic fare, the beer and ambiance make this 5/5.<//Review>

I love this place. You get a real feel for Sam Diego when you come here. The pizza is excellent and you order by the slice instead of getting an entire slice. Parking is a little hard to find but overall a great pizza place!</Review>

The pizza is delicious, the crust is the best. We ate the veggie garlic, the large fed the four of us perfectly. Chased the pizza with a pitcher of chronic Amber. Parking was kinda tricky I ended up paying $10 for 2hr-6hr by gold's gym, seems like everywhere around Mission Bay you have to pay for parking.</Text>

We visited Pizza Port about 10pm on a weekend night to take a pizza pie home to-go. The prices for a small whole pie were surprisingly affordable at 8-11 dollars per pie. Sprinkled with a few dashes of red pepper flakes, we had ourselves a kickin’ late night dinner.

While waiting for the pizza, I had a chance to check out the restaurant/bar/dining/game area.  The place was filled with arcade games, pizza smells, and families. It was like an adult Chuck E. Cheese’s done in a good way.  They’ve also got a pretty good beer selection on tap. We’ll have to come back and have a pizza in house someday.<//Review>

I always come here on Wednesdays for their Wednesday wings/ mozzarella sticks deal. They have 45 cent wings/sticks on Wednesdays and it's always great! The wings paired with their daily 3 dollar beer makes for a great after work hangout spot!</text>

<Review>I would give 5 stars for the beer and their bartenders, but baking section and their staff is very rude and gross. My pizza had a hair inside and the guy instead of apologizing was being rude. Ever since they have new staff in baking sections, their quality of service as well as pizza is going down!<//Review>< pics>

The pizzas are pretty good, but I could see how they would be much better paired with a beer. :-) They have good specials, and have hot wings and cheese sticks, but they are nothing special. Friendly staff and a welcoming atmosphere- but this place gets busy, and has cafeteria style benches set up, so you have to try to find somewhere to sit quick if it is busy and large groups can be hard.</review>< pictures>

I got some times employees with access to the mic think they're funny. But I never get it when my table is sticky. Food itself (pizza) is okay to good but that's it.

Pizza is great and so is the beer. Great place for families. If you don't have a family however you might want to take your pizza elsewhere as it is very loud and chaotic inside the restaurant. Parking can be a very difficult so plan accordingly.< /Text>

There is a HUGE beer selection! So if you're dining in, try making a check list to mark them off as you go. As for pizza, the pizza is better than average but nothing over the line.< /review>< pictures>

Used to like this place until me and my wife came in last weekend for a Beer ,Salad and a Portzal . Then a few hours later we both ended up in the bathroom with stomach issues. Also ordered a Large Pizza to go,and it was regular crust,and we ordered Wheat. I  contacted Zack the GM,but after he asked for some information from me, he disappeared off the grid. Sadly , I will not return to Pizza Port after being brushed away by the GM.<//review>

Pricy for the quality of pizza. Very bland. Didn't try other items so I can't say for that. But pizza was whatever.
Way too crowded and super noisy. And you seat yourself. Some people will come and sit right next to you which I don't like and some will let their kids climb were you are eating (the seats are wooden park tables that are lined up next to each other in rows) . I think it's a place for those who don't have kids. Big selection of alcohol. Staff is really nice!<//review>

<Name>Ben Moore< /Name><date>1470587551502</date><Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Located near the beach, offers a great selection of Pizza Port beer along with other regional craft beer to go with a ton of pizza offerings... what's not to love?  The lunch special is a great way to go, but for the life of me I can't figure out the how/why of the additional $2 charge to add a beer to the meal as this only gives you a $2 discount when you go to the beer counter to get your beer.  So I've paid the $2 add on for my pizza salad to get a beer then get a $2 discount?  Why not just pay full price for my beer and save a step.

Anyway, the pizza, salad, and beer really hit the spot and provided a great base to build on for a full day of brewery hopping!  Would definitely go back.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

<text>We came here for lunch. We had the Meet Extreme Meat. It was packed with meat and very delicious. They also have a great selection of beer especially IPAs. There is plenty of seating indoor or outdoor. Pet friendly as many people brought their dogs.

We will definitely be coming here again when we are in the area.

We bought a six pack of El Camino which was a recent release in cans to go.<//text>< user_id>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>This was a fun place to get a pie and good beer a few blocks from our house. Unfortunately after today we will take our money to Newport Pizza and other establishments in our community. We asked to order a pitcher of beer and the snobby gentleman pouring beer said he would not serve that beer in a pittcher, witch is totally cool. Until he went about tulip glasses and head assuming we were beer experts. We were just looking for a good beer and good not to be reprimanding by a college kid for ordering beer "the wrong way". Bye Pizza Port we had a good run. It's sucks a few of you're employees don't take the Service Industry seriously and have ruined a good thing for hard working people from the neighborhood.< /Text>< Pictures>

You can't go wrong with pizza port. Plenty of great beer on tap, available by the pitcher. Picnic table style common seating inside the brewery/restaurant. Great pizzas to enjoy with some good friends (or even just by yourself with a pitcher of beer, I wouldn't judge you). What else could you want?< /review>

You cannot go wrong here. Beer is straight up awesome. Pizza is no joke either. El Camino is an almost perfect beer...Pickleweed is a close second. Have not disliked anything I have ever had here. Locations all over the county. Enjoy! Cheers!< /Review>

The pizza and beer selection are very good. Lots of topping choices for the pizzas and a good sized menu overall.
We went on a Thursday night and it was extremely crowded. A 10 minute wait in line just to order. The seating was full and we were crowded into the benches. There were kids running all over and very loud. Not a great experience but it's hard to blame the business for being busy.< /Review>

Pizza was really nice !! The perfect match pizza and beer. I   won't take a star from you guys and please you have to get a solution for those tables. They are cover in years of pizza oil. About the disposable dishes also you could have real dishes , I mean it's a restaurant after all and you have where to wash them. Again ! This is a place you should stop and get pizza with family or friends.<//Review>

The location really sells this place. It's close to the beach and near the heart of Ocean Beach town. The beer is alright by San Diego standards, and definitely priced fairly. I have not had food here, but my eyes were certainly jealous of pizzas passing by our table.<//text>

The pizza is probably great...for San Diego. However, if you're from the Northeast, you won't be very impressed by the chewy, doughy, carb-bomb crust. Of course, if you need something to soak up the delicious beer, the pizza or the pizza bites are a good call. But again, this place is all about the beer. That's why you want to come here.<//Text>< Pics>

Loud, enjoyable bar/pizza restaurant. They have a large, visible brewery. The pizza is delicious and the place is perfect for football with TVs all around the restaurant. They also have a miniature arcade for the kids. Unfortunately, there is often little parking.
That's the only con though!</review>

Pizza port makes my second favourite pies ever (sorry, but there's no taste like home). I love their Lahaina pizza. They also are one of the best breweries in OB. Flying Hawaiian is one of my favourite beers and I really wish they packaged it for retail so I could get it more often!</Review>

Not a much better place in the the world to get a pizza and beer - decent prices and great atmosphere.  Beer selection is absolutely crazy, and I believe most of it is made here.  Wait times are relatively short for food.  Will be back the next time we're in San Diego.< /Text>

Great atmosphere for families or kid free couples. Loved the dog friendly patio! Got the Roma pizza...crispy bacon on top was divine. Lots of local brews to pick from!< /Review>

A tad on the crowded side, albeit for a reason. The food is great, the environment fun and they offer great beer. Parking, however, like everywhere in OB, sucks. Park a bit away and get a scooter.<//review>

The pizza can be a little pricey, but it's good. The beer is also good, especially their own brewed beer. And you can go with your dogs. It just gets packed on the patio that you can sit with your dogs. You also need to have your ID to get beer. If you are buying beer for a friend you need to bring their ID up with you when you are buying the beer.< /Review>

<text>Good Pizza, beer, people, and a pinball machine.  What more can you ask for?  The pizza is a little thick and saucy for my taste (I am more of NY pizza girl)  but the ingredients are always very fresh and yummy.  On weekend evenings are very crowded, but lunchtime is not that bad.  They have a good lunch special, a slice, and salad; both are HUGE. Big enough for sharing if you are not so hungry.  If you are in the area give it a try.  Very fun atmosphere!</text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

You can get better pizza from a Little Caesar's. Not impressed. Unbelievably bland. If they would use basil and garlic even a little bit they might salvage at least the pizza on the menu. The Mac n cheese bites were garbage. Thank God they give you ranch and marinara so I was able to stomach 2 pieces of pizza and 2 Mac n cheese bites. But that runs out real quick. I didn't even take my 3/4 of a pizza to go. From the wise words of my sister that is also a kindergarten teacher.... "Suck Less!"<//review>

Always happy with this place. Sometimes it's hard to find a seat on the weekend nights, so be aware of that when coming with a group larger than 2/3. We love the pep/bacon pizza and their IPAS! Always bring our out of town friends when they visit.< /text>

Once again, while looking for pizza we found this place and just the pictures of the food alone brought us into Pizza Port on a Saturday afternoon.  We came with our 3 children, and while I wouldn't necessarily call it a "family restaurant" I was comfortable with my two youngest being there because it's a loud, upbeat place where their noise levels would bother no one.
It took a few minutes to decide what we wanted, but we had an order of buffalo wings, which were dry rub and not super saucy, so they were good.  My littlest two each had slices of their favorite pizzas and the hubby and I each got a small, he had the San Clemente, and I the margherita pizza.  The individual slices were insane, they were bigger than the plates they were on.  The San Clemente has a black bean sauce, and it had this unique flavor that made me think I was eating somewhere between a taco and a pizza...it was quite good.  Then of course there was the Margherita pizza.  Not the best one I have ever had, but it was good and I would eat it again.   Truth be told though, I tasted the San Clemente first and it was so flavorful and yummy that maybe my tastebuds were a little screwy and the Margherita was just plain at that point.
We also enjoyed a Beer Float, something we'd discussed trying many many times, but had never actually come across.  We did at Pizza Port, and the options for beers in my float were amazing.  I went with a coffee porter and was pleasantly surprised.  Not gonna lie, I was skeptical, but I came out of this experience a fan.
This location is good for an afternoon slice and a cold beer or two.  Bringing the kids is totally fine, and going without them is totally fine too.
The atmosphere is laid back, the food is good, and the beer is cold.  What more could you ask for?</Review>

<Text>The pizza and beer may or may not be great, but I will rate the place 1 star because they advertise slices and apparently do not sell them all day. I walked in around 7pm and waited in line as I saw slices priced on the menu board.  I ordered 2 slices and a beer.  I was told "we don't sell slices until 9pm".  I said you have to be kidding.  I was told "we don't sell slices after 3pm". It all worked out though as I went down a couple blocks and had an excellent burger, rings and a beer at a super friendly shop around the corner.  As far as this place goes... I will get my slices elsewhere.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Review>Came here after hearing mixed reviews from friends, and it was alright. Plenty of beer options, friendly staff overall, but the pizza was ehh. Good size slices, but very thin and greasy. The long tables (like an elementary school cafeteria) could make for an awkward and uncomfortable meal if the people next to you are rude or loud, but it's OB so most people are chill.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

< Review>
Pizza Port is always poppin'. I drove by it 100s of times while living in Cardiff by the Sea. It's packed at lunch and dinner. They make their own beer there too. Try the honey beer. It's full of awesomeness.

It's kid friendly and has video game arcades too. The only thing I didn't like too much about it is the lack of seating available, but I guess that's what happens when you get great pizza and beer.

You basically order your pizza at the register and find a seat as fast as someone stands up. They will call your name over the loud speaker. No waiters here. Lots of fun. There is also another location (i think in Ocean Beach).<//Review>

<review>Pizza is very very good yet slightly overrated in comparison. Beer selection is all-time. Street side patio is a nice place to hang out outside and enjoy your grub. Inside seating feels like grade school cafeteria but it works out. Favorite part is the surf decor and overall vibe is just chilling.

Enjoyed a company party on the rooftop one time which was a unique and awesome experience. Very accommodating for groups.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Name>

Great pizza - super cheesey, with the toppings under the cheese! We had the Monterey pizza, which was excellent. Solid amount of toppings, and it stayed together really well.

Good selection of beers as well.

Seating is open, largely long picnic table-style seating indoors, and a patio outside. The patio closes about an hour earlier than the restaurant. It was crowded on a Wednesday night during Comic Con but we were still able to find a seat easily.< /Review>

From Wisconsin - HAD to check it out.  Great beer - wish I would've checked a bag so I could bring some home.  Definitely take an uber - you'll want to try multiple beers. Only took them until about the sixth round to stop asking me if I wanted to close my tab!</Review>

If you are ever in this neck of the woods. Come to Pizza Port. They have amazing brews and amazing pies. You can't ever go wrong with a place that breaths drinks and makes awesome sauce in everything they ever do. Also the people who work and run this place are the bomb dot com.</Review>

5/5 for the beer and 3/5 for the pizza. Excellent beer selection in various types from light to dark and smooth to hoppy. Pizza is a tad doughy as should be cooked longer for some crisp.< /Review>

<Text>Great pizza, lots of beer (and they were brewing while we were there).  Lots of people in the place with no A/C made it a tad bit warm, but still a fun atmosphere.  Parking is terrible, but there is a $5 lot just east of the restaurant.<//Text>< Pics>

These guy have great pizza - but everyone knows that. Something that I love Pizza Port for is their amazing sour beer offerings. As a sour beer lover, I can't just go anywhere to get my fix but these guys deliver with a great selection. If you're not too keen on sour beer, don't worry - they've got a large A+ selection of beers.< /text>

<Text>Best pizza in town! Plus a great selection of mostly local and some imported brews. Shark bite ipa, Oatmeal beer, and even one with Pikachu on the logo are some of the ones I've tried recently, they're all great! Highly recommend! If you are trying to come around dinner time especially on the weekend, be prepared to fight for parking and seating. It's still worth 5 stars ^______^<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

Busy. VERY busy ... wasnt too impressed, although when I asked the hotel I'm staying at if they could lead me to a good pizza pie place, this was her opinion. . Took my 3 kids under age 6 and it just wasnt  what we were looking for. If your into craft beers of course this is your stop! Not a family oriented place for us.. very busy,packed and loud.< /Review>

Great spot but be prepared for a crowd and lots of kids.  The tables are pretty close together and it was a little difficult for me to transfer from my wheelchair to a bench seat but thats not the restaurants fault, it's the fault of the able-bodied family sitting at the only handicap accessible table. The employees are friendly and the pizza was stupid good. Great spot for a slice or a whole pie if you are in a group.  They do have a gluten free option for the crust but it's $3 more for those of you in need a GF option.  Plus they were advertising for a hemp beer that is brewed with hemp seeds, on the table that I think I will have to try out next time.</Text>

You have to accept ahead of time that while being at pizza port, you are inevitably going to either bump into a another patron or staff member.  The place is small but from my most recent visits I've noticed that this is part of the charm (aside from the craft beer and hand made pizza) in that everytime I leave, I've made a new friend being dragged into the conversation of any adjacent groups.<//review>

<Review>if i could leave negative one star review, i would. this place is horrible. food sucks, pizza sauce sucks, no subs or sandwiches, drink selection sucks. beer is superb tho. pizza port beer is very good. some employees there are very rude and disrespectful as well as some of the managers. but if you need a quick fix of overpriced poor quality pizza and beer to get a d.u.i. on the way home, go for it!!!!!!!</Review>< pictures>

The register lines are organized very weirdly. That is, they're generally disorganized. Meaning the already lethargic staff is further disadvantaged by confused customers waiting for service. The beer is great though!<//review>

I can't really think of anything bad to say about this pizza port. I usually go on Sunday afternoon and it is not too busy. The pizza and beer are fantastic and cheap with an excellent selection.<//review>

Great Pizza, Good Beer. Too crowded. At night this place is packed. It doesn't help that their lines are confusing, creating uncomfortable situations and people accusing other people of cutting in line. It is not the customers fault but poor crowd control. Better just go somewhere more mellow and organized.< /text>

If I were to say anything negative about the joint, is it's a bit crowded. Don't expect to come to Pizza Port and get a private table for two. All seating is community style, and the place is loud... so be in the mood to be social! And if you aren't, just have a pitcher of beer and you'll be adding to the noise level in no time :-)</text><Rate>4< /Rate></record>

Beer was good, pizza was great. Super busy. It is kind of annoying going with two people and one person saving a seat while the other orders food and then you switch out to finally get beer... Meh. Would rather go somewhere else next time but there was no problems with service or beer quality, so 4 stars.< /text>

Good pizza, great beer.  My wife and I ordered a large pizza, but a medium is probably a more reasonable size for a couple.  On a Saturday night, this place is a little packed and hectic even for a Manhattanite, but it's worth a visit.</Review>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Text>BBQ Sliders, gormet personal pizza and kind beers all while hanging with good friends and watching some football. That is how to spend the end of October.

Also, a side note... I left my skateboard at the front after I ordered my beer. About 10 minutes later they called out over the loud speaker thay they had it behind the counter. I was super relieved as my daughter had juat done this herself a month earlier at a different place and she wasn't so lucky. This was my cruiser too. So, the wheels and trucks are basically brand new and the deck is unique as it is one I received after becoming a member of Skate for Change in 2012 a non-profit organization that gives back to their community.</Text>< Gmap_id>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>One of my favorite joints to grab a slice. Their garlic knots are heaven and the beer selection is pretty kick-ass as well. The service is always on point and this place gets hoppin' in the evenings. Grab a table, and your honey and hunker down for a piece o' pie and a brew.< /Review>< pics>

This used to be the best pizza in OB but my last 2 visits were disappointing. The staff were not very attentive & the pizza crust was not great. I was there, both times, with 3 other people & we all had the same opinion. Next time I'm in the mood for pizza I'll be at pizza Port.<//text>

<Review>This place is terrible. It took them 50 minutes for a small pizza as I watched them serve a dozen people that came after me. I let them know at 30 minutes that I might have missed them calling my name (because they mumble into a microphone for literally a microsecond- your name instead of a number) so they get confused every time there’s a Mike or a Jen...  as a side note the men’s bathroom has one soap dispenser which is hella awkward when 2 people arrive at the dual sinks at the same time.... and I kid you not the hot water is boiling. Steam comes from it. The foods alright but you’re never gunna get it.<//Review><Name>Jeremy Coffman</Name></record></dataset><record>

1) The pizza is very doughy and causes you to not taste the toppings.  I will NEVER get their pizza again!
2) The beer is decent
3) The fact you have to order your beer separate and pay separate from your food is stupid!</text>

Like this place, but came in for the lunch special right before the end of it. The line was long and by the time I got to the front they said no lunch special for you. Little customer service would be nice.< /text>

<rating>3</rating><review>Great tasting food, false advertising on the beer. Once I ordered, the girl bartender, who was holding a pint glass the whole time changed the price by $3 more, stating that regular beers were the ones priced at $7.
What's a regular beer. In my world, all beers are measured by pints or larger.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80deaa3a261cd2e3:0x3e89464c53bf352</GmapID></record>

Pizza Port is a must.  One of the only real pizza places around.  It is almost made in a a classic italian style.  Great ingredients.  Just a really amazing pizza, wondering what time they close, just talking about it is making me want a slice or even a whole pie.  A must try.<//text>

<text>Really nice vibe here at PIzza Port. People are rough around the edges but overall pretty friendly. More often that not, every time I'm there, somehow another person's pizza slice ends up on my plate. It's strange but I don't fight it. Neither do the high number of dogs that can be found here during and after hours.

Also... they have big buck hunter. You're likely able to find many of the local 25 yr olds cocking shotguns and high-fiving while pounding wings on a wednesday night. Good vibes, although PP wing's have slowly slipped down hill like the arizona frat boys at nobes on a saturday.</text><Time>1526529034979< /Time><Rating>4<//Rating></record>

The pizza was decent, and they have a large beer selection. It is a very young and busy place with communal tables, so not suitable for a quiet conversation.< /Text>

Great pizza. Easy to find. Friendly and patient service since we had to figure out what to order -- great menu to choose from. A hangout for locals for sure. Not very family friendly due to the 2 tvz with the Spike Channel on and 1000 ways to die was being shown at that time. Needless to say my elementary age kids were a bit shocked to see this show and we had to find a seat so they couldn't see those tv screens.<//review>

<text>Didn't get a chance to try the beer but I am sure it is good based on reviews. I walked in and found a long line for a Beer and Food order counter. So I made my way to the bar where I asked the bartender if I could order just beer, and he said "sure" and took my beer order of two beers for me and my brother. He went to go grab the beers and was stopped by another employee. He then came back and informed us we had to wait in the long line to order anything. I have never seen such a complicated ordering setup just to get a beer at any other brewery.<//text>< Pictures>

However I have a lot of non-craft beer drinking friends that come here just for the food, so my standards might be high. To me the pizza is the perfect complement to their beer - doughy, cheesy and loaded with toppings. Their beers are very underrated compared to other breweries in San Diego, mostly because they make so many that aren't all world-class. But all of them are above average, priced fairly, and served fresh from the brewery in a casual family-friendly environment. Frequently Pizza Port creates some beers that really knock it out of the park (Santa's Little Helper, Mongo IPA, Bacon & Eggs Breakfast Coffee Porter, etc.) They have a generous amount of taps devoted to "guest brewery beers" including Russian River, Ballast Point, etc. Their homemade root beer is awesome, I recommend trying a float. Or try some of their "beer buddies" which is cooked pizza dough bites brushed with garlic butter.< /text>< UserId.>

The pizza is really just a vehicle to put out an extensive beer selection, but these sturdy brews are best reserved for beer connoisseurs, and are for those who like heavy-duty suds.  Zagat's 25 food rating is suspect, with pizza that only gets the job done; mediocrity for the undemanding.  If you want to go where the locals go though, and don't mind a lot of enebreated togetherness with them, it might be worth a try.  Not for kids at night.< /review>

I always love checking out all of the surfboards decorating the walls, but the awesome painting on the bottom of a longboard of OB from the jetty to the pier over by the beer taps takes the cake!

Came in with a group of friends for our last meal during our San Diego trip. Most of the group heard great things about Pizza Port, so it had to be a clear winner? Parking can be an issue with limited spots available, but luckily we found street parking about a block away.

The atmosphere of the restaurant looked fun and inviting. There were many flat screen TV's around the restaurant playing the football game. The seating reminded me of long park bench tables, big enough to fit large parties of 20 or 30. The craft beer bar is located on the left side of the restaurant while food is in the middle.

As far as food, Pizza Port offers premium gourmet pizzas. I originally wanted the Pizza SF but two friends had already ordered that, so I just randomly chose the featured month pizza, Teriyaki Chicken. It was just okay and I probably wouldn't get it again. The flavors didn't mesh well for me; carrots & broccoli inside a cheesy pizza. The pizza's are portioned generously, so if you're one person just go with the individual. There's also arcade games towards the back of the pizza restaurant. Pizza Port reminds me of an adult Shakey's. I will definitely come back but order the pizza I want regardless of who in the group gets it.</text>

Don’t be fooled by the name, Pizza Port is a great pizza place as well, but even if they didn’t have pizza at all, they would be a pretty great bar and brewery. The outside patio section under some palm trees is awesome on nice days. The inside is huge with lots of long tables and great for big gatherings or small get togethers alike. The beer menu is huge as the Pizza Port brewing empire has several facilities. There are probably close to 3 dozen beers on tap across the range from blonde ales to porters. There are of course multiple hop forward IPAs that go great on a hot day. Even the malty wheat and ales are pretty delicious. The inside is a good place to catch sports as well with many TVs. The pizza isn’t bad either. This is your place to go to grab a pint after some time in the sun on the beach for sure.< /Text>

You may have been told to check out some of OB's landmarks but if Pizza Port isn't on top your missing out. For a beer connoisseur, their guest list is great but their home brews are always on point with an option for every taste.</review>

<Review>All pizza ports are rad! The pizza goes like this. Nice thick crust that is always cooked all the way through. Dankest toppings and specialty pies. They also have these things called Beer buddies, try them, they will change your life with their garlicy dankness. Insane beer as usual. Same crappy rude service though but that doesn't seem to stop me from coming back time after time. Dont think it stops many people...<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

A smaller of the pizza ports. Quite nice of an atmosphere and of course a ton of beer selection both brewed by pizza port and guest breweries.<//Review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><review>This is the quintessential surfer/craft beer hangout.  I think I literally saw Jeff Spicoli (if you're not old enough to know who that is, forget it).

On a serious note, the only thing that is not awesome about this place is the parking situation, but then again what can you expect in OB and thank the flying spaghetti monster that there are no soul sucking multi-story parking garages ruining the vibe that is OB.

I haven't been to the other Pizza Ports yet, but this one was fantastic albeit packed to the gills.  As you probably already know there is a plethora of home brewed craft beers, as well as plenty of guest taps.  Heavy on the D/I/PAs, in fact when I was there I think they had 7 IPAs and  3 or 4 DIPAs.  The beer line and the pizza line are separate and there are virtually no vegetarian pizza options, unless you roll your own (which you can if you want).

If I lived in OB (I'm not sure how this is possible anymore with real estate prices the way they are) I'd be there several times a week.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

These places that focus on food over beer are usually a disaster when it comes to beer. The Pizza Port on the other hand makes some great beer.</Text>

<Name>Lyndsi Winer<//Name><resp>None</resp><date>1409024064431< /date><Text>I can't particularly say I LOVE their pizza but it's ok.  Their atmosphere is great and their beer even better. They brew their own beer and dozens of types!  All SUPER SUPER awesome!  It's a place for craft beer aficionados!  Their staff is always happy to be there and happy to serve you and I very rarely can complain about them.  The pizza is ok, they have great specialty ingredients and the larger the pizza the better the crust I think.  Don't get a small if you don't like a lot of dough more like a hand tossed pan pizza.  The large is good and the lunch slices even better!  In fact they have the best lunch deal in town!  An amazing garden salad that me and my bf share and HUGE slices of pizza and soda for 5$ and if you want a beer its a 1$ more for regular beer and 2$ for stronger beers.  They always have a unique slice of the day accompanied with the choice also of pepperoni or cheese everyday and the slice with the salad is perfect!  I ate this almost daily when I worked across the street!  They are fast and the lunch is good and soooooo cheap!! They also have great salads!  The port salad is one of my favs!  It's all veggies and has so much in it that is unique you'll never miss the meat!  Roasted red peppers, blue cheese, spring mix, marinated portobellos and more!  It's to die for!!!<//Text>< gmapID>

< Review>
We came here to hang out with friends, and this was a perfect spot. Great food, great beer selections, and great company!

We came here on a Sunday night, a night before Memorial day. It's been awhile, and I completely forgot how crazy busy it is in these Ocean Beach streets. We got luckily how easily we found a table fit for 8 people.  The place is always packed and  loud, however people are quite polite and respectful.

We tried out the honey beers, Carlsbad pizza, cajun bites, garlic bites and chicken wings.  The honey beers were a treat for me. I'm not much of a beer drinker, but the Honey beer is something I would keep ordering. It's light, tart, and a hint of honey for the after taste.  The carlsbad pizza intrigued me --with the mix of artichoke hearts, feta cheese, alfredo sauce and peppers. The pizza was a tasty creation. The saltiness and sweetness flavors worked well with the ingredients. Though, the chicken wings didn't impress me much. It was average. The cajun & garlic bites were ok. They were made in a pizza bread, and then cut into pieces, cajun ---with jalapenos & garlic -- stating the obvious, and put into a basket to share.

Whenever I'm in Ocean Beach, I'd be back here for the assortment of beers and pizza selections!</Review>

Great pizza and salad, set up very authentic, very asked, so it's hard to find a place to sit and it takes a while to get your food, but it's worth it and you can spend the time watching different sports on the TVs all over the walls< /Text>

Very stressful when busy. Your on your own if you brave ordering and see there is no place to sit. Had a work party, and you do not enjoy the stress of hovering over people looking for seating. Pizza is just good.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) I asked for only $ 20. The reason for the cheapness is that every Wednesday it's 45 cents a wing and a cheese stick. It's 45 cents from 5:00 until closing, so please try it. The wings are hard for small children, so it is better to try one wing first. I recommend flight beer rather than glass.

(Original)
これだけ頼んで20ドルです。安さの理由は、毎週水曜日は、ウイングとチーズスティックガ45セントだからです。5時から閉店まで45セントなので是非お試しください。ウイングは、小さお子様には、辛いと思いますので先ず1つ試食させた方が良いと思います。ビールは、グラスよりもフライトを僕は、オススメします。</Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) The pizzas and the super excellent beers! We ordered wings but they are not nothing special although they are baked not fried. A lot of beer to choose from and several screens with sports. Beware, beer is ordered and collected individually by person with identification in hand. There are no waiters.
