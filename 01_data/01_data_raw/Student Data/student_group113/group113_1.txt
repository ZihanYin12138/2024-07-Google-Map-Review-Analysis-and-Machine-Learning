< review>
So, I'm not very good at figuring out what style to cut my hair in that would enhance my look.

On top of that, I work at the Renaissance Faire and like getting intricate braids, when I can. Cutting my hair into a bob, as so many keep telling me would look great with my Asian features.... um... no. I just don't like short hair on myself.

This was my first time having Miranda cut my hair. But, I felt good trusting my hair in her hands.  Something I do not do lightly.

I mean, at that very well known, 1 word S hair cutting place when I had hair less than a hands width from my bottom I asked for a trim. I was asked to stand the entire cut or she "could not guarantee my hair would be straight." I walked out with my hair just barely before my shoulder line.

If it was unhealthy and needed it, ok; but, tell me before you do it!!!

Anyway,  back to Miranda...

After looking at my hair, she told me that she was thinking of slightly rounding my hair line in back and giving me some gentle layers to help give it body. I really appreciated this because, as a gastric bypass patient who had lost a LOT of hair both in amount and body, my hair just looked blah to me. I typically would just put it in a Pony tail.

Then, there was the damaged ends of my hair...

Who wants to walk around with a rats nest at the end of your hair? But, that was the result after a friend had used vo+lume 50 to bleach my hair.  I was left with a Lot of straw.

Although I hadn't mentioned it, partly because I forgot I had them since the last time my hair was cut was the last quarter of 2019; but, Miranda picked up on the fact that I had bangs and she wanted to cut them again to help them frame my face better.

I told her that I had always gone without because my hair had this strange thing where, no matter what product I used, if I had bangs, I had a split down the center of my foreheads could put mouse or gel on them, use my curling iron to get that "Betty" look and I would spray hair spray on it as it was curled around the hot cutting iron.

I kid you not,  that beautiful curl would split like someone doing a Chinese/Side split.

When I saw the results, I know I needed to say something. Hehe thanks Miranda! I'm loving it.

I can feel the bounce in my hair, where it used to be limp and unmoving before. I love how my bangs frame my face. It detracts from the skin dash I've developed since surgery.

This was definitely worth the trip. The ladies take care of their shop. Two were mopping as I entered. Another hit a run down of thing Miranda had done, as I was getting situated. Masks were written.

Overall a great experience.

If you don't have an idea of what you want or even if you do; set up an appointment with Miranda. You will not go wrong!<//review>

As a self-groomed hair beautician of many years, I offered my prescribed haircut, and kept my eyes closed throughout the entire process. The results came out amazingly well. There was a mild excess to the hair, which allowed me to perform finer shaping and layering according to my own taste. And now I no longer fear seeing the barber!< /Review>

<text>Was visiting Pasadena for the Rose Parade and my son needed a cut, I have never been to this Salon/barbershop. I walked in and was greeted by a delightful stylist she was a breath a fresh air, super sweet. She started on my son Johnny immediately,  I loved his hair cut came out really good. He loved it also, he said he wished he could get his cut there all the time by Kevin the girl.....very happy with our visit there...< /text><username>Stephany Munoz<//username><user_id>117672561264866072356< /user_id>< date>

She asked questions throughout the haircut and showed me updates to be sure I liked the look. Definitely ask for the MVP treatment. It's the only way to go. Carla also gave great and honest information about hair product I should use to maintain my fly hairstyle. She definitely hooked me up so we'll be back on the regular.</review>< Pics>

My son had the best experience EVER! They took really great care of him. I am horrible with names, but the person who cut his hair really took time to visit with him as well.
So, great haircut, great company. Fabulous!!</Text>

1st time going there. Took my grandson for a haircut. I forgot the hair stylist's name. But she had very long hair with bangs. She was very nice. She handled my grandson very nicely. My grandson is a handful and loves to talk(8y/o). I told her to give him a combover and able to spike it too. She did an awesome job!!
As we were paying my granddaughter(also came w/us) she noticed that her softball team picture was on the wall. The electric eels. She was all excited about it.
I will be bring my grandson BACK!!<//Text>

I enjoy this place very much. I find there prices great for the quality your getting. I even found a set barber I go too which I have never done. Watch sports while getting your cut too.  And if you want to indulge your self, get the towel treatment. I don't think I'll be going to any other barber shop for some time.<//review>

I was in town for an event & needed a beard & neck trim. I believe it was Valerie who took care of me. This was the first time I’ve grown a full beard & I have to say she did a much better job than I could have. A Great Job In fact!
Friendly & professional. Highly recommend.</review>

<Text>I usually dont request specific stylist, but when viri at sports clips pasadena faded me up for the first time, that behavior changed.  Viri has been taking care of me for about a year now, and I wouldnt know what to do if she left.  Her work is detailed, clean, and done to perfection.  I would highly recommend sports clips in general, but more so viri as a stylist.< /Text>< rating>

Sports Clips is great. I used them where I used to live and never had an issue. The reason for the 4 stars was because I asked for my usual haircut and it seemed a bit longer than normally. I asked to have it shorter and she shortened it a bit but got me out of the chair without giving me a chance to see if it was good. I realize part of this was my fault for not speaking up when she was taking the cover thing off me. I just wasn't really sure what to do. It was also difficult because I couldn't really understand what she was saying and I asked "what?" a lot but just could not understand her.. So Sports Clips is great and I definitely recommend going there, however, I rated four stars because of that experience.<//text>

So I tried using the app to check in but when I got to the location my name was not on the board. So the app needs some work for users. However my experience at location was great. I didn't have to wait long and Katsama greated me and gave me a great cut. She was pleasant and patient with me.< /review>

It really depends on the person you get,
I went it twice, the first time was a Thai girl, It was perfect.
The second time it really suck. Luckily for her i didn't get time to check the detail.
Went to work and and took a look and the back was not straight at all, told her I don't like their product and she put anyway.

Guess it will be the last time i go there even if i am in an hurry.

I go to Sports Clips in Pasadena. I always ask for Karla K. as my stylist. She's got some serious skills. She cuts my hair with lots of care. Excellent precision! Her fades are immaculate. Way beyond my expectations. And I'm a perfectionist! And get this, she does this EVERY TIME. She's consistent. And I visit weekly. I ask for the same exact haircut every week, but my hair never grows the same of course. So I like to watch as she applies real technique when she styles my untamed thick head of hair. I can always count on her for a boost in my self esteem. Her MVP, puts me to sleep. So nice. All the Stylists who work there are very sweet and welcoming. Beautiful personalities. And they keep that place spotless.<//text>

<Response>None<//Response><text>They treated my son and I like the bonny king and prince of England! It goes like this. First they cut your hair... exactly (at last!) the way I asked them to cut it! Then they take me to another quiet room, with the lights dimmed (yes, for real). I am placed in a big comfortable massage chair, which gently leans back to allow me to have my neck gently rested on a support with my head hung over a sink. My hair is washed in warm water. My scalp is gently and quietly dried and massaged. I am then taken back to the original chair for any touch up trimming. Finally, my neck and shoulders are massaged with a hand held electrical device and I am prepared to literally float back out into the world! Oh, not quite yet! I wait a bit longer while they finish taking care of my 10 year old son who has been simultaneously receiving the same treatment, although even longer because they really sincerely love serving children!  Will I ever come back? Hah! I sat down to write this because I was looking them up on Google so I could go back tonight. I mean, really... Why in the world would I EVER go to a regular barber again?< /text><Rating>5<//Rating><gmapID>0x80c2dca85013db73:0x14420d2a0bcdd46d<//gmapID>< username>

Worst service I have ever experienced, will never go back to these guys.
Not sure why do they need appointments section on their website, if they don’t follow it. Vl if you don’t value your customers don’t waste our time too.</Review>

<Review>I followed my barber Kris from the Duarte store to the Pasadena store when Duarte closed.  Her excellent work, friendly yet professional personality fuels my loyalty and drives me to go to wherever she works. I’m especially pleased she is in Pasadena as I live in Pasadena thus no longer have to drive to Duarte for hair cuts.

The Pasadena store’s location (Colorado Blvd) is in a good location, has plenty of free parking and near other stores and restaurants I frequent.  The store is well maintained, neat, clean and the staff is open and friendly.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1531517571023, 'text': "Thanks for the great review Judy!

Worst haircut ever! My son went there for a haircut and it was so bad I went in to talk to the stylist Kitty who is also the assistant manager. She never apologized or was able to accept responsibility that she messed up his hair. She even went as far as trying to blame him for the cut,"he was so quite" so he was quite so you gave him a bad haircut. I asked for his money back...she said she would have to ask her boss and get back to me...which she never did. I went today and saw her sitting in the back. She couldnt even confront me in person sent the other girl to lie and say she was on her break and that they couldnt refund the money but would re-cut it for free. My son does not want them to touch his hair. As soon as I walked out Kitty who was on her "break" came out and cut a guy's hair! The sign clearly say's "precision cuts guaranteed"</review>

HORRIBLE !!!! HORRIBLE !!!!  I Normally don't like to write bad reviews but this is how bad this place is. My dad came in and he had is cut from Zoey and he told us to have it down by her because she does a great job or Kitty. Well when i took my son they both where not there and i  am not from the area so i figured all the ladies do a great job. Wrong!! Before Hair Stylist Nicky started to cut his hair I told her how i  want it on the top little longer in the front because he likes his hair spikey, and she said OK. Than so rudely she told me to sit down and go to the lobby area. By the time she was almost done i looked up she shave his head !! OMG!! my son in tears i ask her why she did this and she was so rude to me and raise her voice and said that's how i told her to do it. Really??  and ignoring me so i got very mad at her. I spoke with the supervisor Valerie and all she was doing protecting her not hearing me out. Telling me i was the rude person. I told her other barber shops men cutting my sons hair always done i always ask for. And Valerie responds is oh women have style on there hair cuts .OMG!!! really ? they completely shave my 7 yr old sons hair. And They took him to the back to wrap his head with warm towel and than she burns his Face !!!!!! and she is telling me to leave and sit down at the Lobby on who leaves a child alone with crazy people girls like this my son in tears so i had enough and still the supervisor Valerie still arguing with me. I  ask for the managers phone number and she gave me was her email, So i  emailed her the same day which was Tuesday and now is Thursday and she has not responded. This very unprofessional place. Figures i went for first time customer hair cut for free. And maybe because it was free they torture my 7 yr old. Worse place ever !!! THESE LADIES DON'T KNOW HOW TO RUN A BARBER SHOP OR EVEN CUT HAIR. I was better off taking him to Fantastic Sam. I agree with all the bad reviews that was left just previously before me and its seems they also had therer hair ruin. And prices are very high!!!!!  Horrible !!!!!!! BIG WARNING TO THIS PLACE TREATING LITTLE BOYS WRONG ESPECIALLY BURNING HIS FACE<//Text>

Had this one girl condescend and insult me the whole time. Then when it came time for me to get the steamed towel she didn't even cool it off first and just laughed at my pain. Do not go here.<//Review>

Parking lot very unsafe for customers and business owners.  I got robbed  today and there was no security and this is the second time it has happened. I highly recommend staying away from this place.</Text>

<review>I deliver to rest depot 650 weekly delivering lamb and specialty meats. The employees are always working hard at a difficult job. Customers need to understand that they recieve at least 40 to 50 deliveries from semi trucks and delivery vans every day.. Bringing dry goods, frozen and chilled meats and even furniture. After waiting your turn the delivery process is as fast as can be while observing safety rules. Been working with them for a couple of years now and look forward to a few more. Great store supplying much wanted goods. Thanks 650.

I loved this place. I know appearance and staffing may not be top class but that’s the business model. I was amazed to see low rates of meat products. It’s meant for shop owners and restaurants.<//Review>

< review>
11/23/2020 - Just spoke to them.  During the pandemic they are open to the public.  Bring a valid ID.  They do not offer delivery at this time.  After the pandemic, you can join with valid business credentials.  Not sure if this means it must be restaurant or any business (such that you would use a coffee maker, snacks, stuff like that).  I've not been there yet.</review>

< review>
This place is great for buying business grocery but most of the time big lines they should open more lines . It’s hard to stand in lines for more than hour for the people who run a business or Cheff or employee of the business. It use to be a good place until last year now we started buying groceries from Cheeta Costco S&J is better option.
But we can be back if they can resolve long wait In lines.</review>

Worst Restaurant Depot I ever seen. Long ques in check out. Only 3 out of 11 counters open for check out. If you plan buy only few items, don't go for it.<//Review>

Eiei solved problem with my membership card in a very friendly and professional way and San Juan helped me to get product I need from very top shelf in just a few minutes. Thank you! You made my day and it's was definitely worth it to drive all the way from San Jose.<//text>< Pictures>

They seem to close between 3 and 5 pm for shift change, if i am not mistaken.

I would never accept a load to this facility super slow spent all my day for nothing....
Why do you order staff and make appointments and then say we have no room if you have no room....go out of business or move to a different place. Don't make owner operators spend 24 hours after appointments to sit near your warehouse.< /review>

To shop at this paticular Restaurant Depot is a horrible to star with the checkout lines beyond terribly 40min to an hour you should expect all time while you waiting in line if your car didn't not broken you are lucky, the most astonishing things the have a security guard around they just don't do anything even collecting of offenders license plates or any description but collecting shopping carts and will explain you it is on going problems in that Restaurant depot. I wish people organize one day to boycott I will support them that way the management will come with solutions .<//text>

<Text>I wish that I could say that they have customer service, but they don't. The front desk when entering has a horrible attitude. I would never shop there again. The sad part is that the management supports her so that culture from top down is bad. Also, the return policy for none perishable foods is only 48 hours as per this clerk. Not sure if she is lying, but that horrible. Who does that?< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

This place is a huge benefit to a family business of ours because the prices on some items are just great. On the other hand, the location is a bit out of the way and they always seem to have huge lines when you go early afternoon. I've waited over 25 minutes just to checkout on some days which isn't way too long but when you're running a business every second counts.</Text>

< Review>
The food and ambiance despite a pandemic was great. Pianist and outdoor dinning made for a great energy. The broth  from the mussels was warm and bright. The pomegranate sauce that accompanied my duck confit was EVERYTHING. Sweet,  savory, spicy, umami!!! I cant forget to mention the creme brulee cheescake!! Rich and creamy, perfect mix of both desserts.  Def coming back. Food ervice was a bit slow, however I attribute that to staffing ..our server was great.. she was friendly and knowledgeable.< /Review>

Amazing 👏
Outstanding food. We were treated as if we were honored guests and as if we had our own private chef. Thank you!< /text>

Had to order curbside takeout, but had an extremely delicious Chicken Cordon Bleu. My wife had the Chicken Riesling and loved it! Looking forward to when things get back to normal so we can dine in!</Text>

<Name>Kevin Vierra</Name><Text>Had a great meal with friends. The atmosphere is good but definitely off the beaten path of where you would expect a fine dining experience. The menus is photo copies on plane paper in black and white. Odd. The food is great though. I had a seafood lasagna that had lobster, shrimp and crab. Oh that was good!!!  I would give it 5 stars if it had a little nicer atmosphere.</Text><time>1581191257070</time></record>

I don’t normally write reviews. But this restaurant was so spectacular that I felt compelled to write one. Every dish from the mussels to the stone fruit salad to the butternut squash ravioli to the lamb was incredible. We finished off the evening with a chocolate lava cake. The service was also amazing. If you are a foodie - you will love this restaurant!<//text>

<Text>Scottie is an excellent place to enjoy a meal! My wife and I celebrated our Anniversary there and what a treat it was!! It seemed like we had our own Chef and waiter! Scottie gave us great advice on the wine, where he gets his supplies and history on his supplies. The service and staff were excellent. We will definitely visit this restaurant again very soon!</Text>< pictures>

We love Scottie's Shutters Brasserie! The food is consistently great and Scotty treats everyone like family. Everytime we have something special to celebrate, this is our spot. The restaurant is clean, the service is friendly and professional and the menu is outstanding.  I recommend the pork chop. My wife would kill for the salmon wellington... though that is a special so not always on the menu. Having a date night in east county? Try Scottie's<//Review>

Scottie and his staff were on point this evening.  They immediately greeted us by name (the husband had made reservations) when we walked through the door.  A table had already been set up for us along with two glasses of complimentary champagne (we were celebrating a belated Valentine's Day).  The waitress, and I am so sorry I can't remember her name, was phenomenal.  She was very attentive and polite.  The food was delicious, especially the garlic bread and cordon bleu.  As we we're getting ready to leave after a meal, or waitress was so kind and handed us our leftovers as she opened the door for us. Such a wonderful little restaurant, and a great staff. On a side note, it was wonderful to see the owner inside the restaurant greeting customers, helping at the tables, and also cooking in the kitchen.  Bravo!</Text>

Service was great. Food was cool overall but the dishes we had could've used more salt to bring out the flavor. Because of this, I felt like it brought down the value of the meal, but I'd be willing to go back & try them again in the event it was an off night</review>

The chefs at Shutters had a meatloaf daily special when I visited, along with spinach and mashed potatoes. The meatloaf was one of the best that I've had in the bay area, and the ambience of the restaurant is unexpectedly exceptional. Relaxed and refined with candlelight, amazing food, and pretty decent wait staff. This little spot in a strip mall is a diamond in the rough, and should absolutely not be missed!<//Text>

Scotties is a place we go to celebrate something! Excellent quality food so well prepared, ambience not evident from the outside, and attentive service from friendly chef and wait staff! Luncheon shrimp salad was full of freshly grown greens, perfectly grilled shrimp, flavorful light dressing. We shared the decadent chocolate flourless cake and smooth creme brûlée. Both were outstanding! We LOVE this place, have taken several friends, and have recommended it to all our new neighbors!! The BEST of Brentwood!!< /review>

Food and service was awesome. Looks a little rough on the outside, but is nicely furnished and comfortable once you're inside. A little on the pricey side, but definitely worth it if you're looking for a white tablecloth, fine dining experience.<//review>

Absolutely Satisfied.

The abridged review - great atmosphere, amazing food and excellent service. My husband and I can’t wait until our next visit! Thank you to Scottie and the wonderful staff you have employed. Truly made our anniversary very special, especially being our first as Brentwood residents!

I have to note, we had our excellent experience all while two new staff members were being trained in the kitchen and two servers had called in sick. Keep reading for the detailed review.. : )

My husband and I are relatively new to Brentwood and heard this was the best place in town for a romantic night out. We were celebrating our 4 year wedding anniversary and were not disappointed in our experience. They note ‘slow service’ on their site, unless you have a time constraint (in which case let them know). We thought the night was wonderful and really let us enjoy each plate as it came.

We had a table right opposite the kitchen and really enjoyed watching all the food be prepared. We were able to watch as such delicious plates were created and sent out. We started with the garlic bread and their caprese salad. Delish! The garlic bread comes with a great dipping sauce too! Then we shared a bowl of the soup de j’our, cream of asparagus. SOO GOOD. My husband had their steak dish - the veggies were cooked perfectly and the mushroom/red wine sauce/topping to the steak was amazing! I ordered the chicken riesling - soo good! Again, veggies were perfectly cooked and complimented the dish so nicely. I wanted to lick both our plates! We finished our meal with a piece of their cheesecake - HOLY COW - so delicious and light. We were in love. Can’t wait to visit again!!< /Review>

<rate>5</rate><review>This is by far the best food experience one can get in the wider East county! Scottie is one of the best chefs I have had the pleasure to prepare a meal for me! The service is excellent as well. Food ingredients are from mostly local farms and everything is fresh and prepared from scratch. No frozen, reheated, or otherwise disgusting foods there!! The atmosphere is modern, industrial, but casual and romantic (candles, etc.). Nice selection of wines too. Prices are absolutely fair! My favorite eating establishment in the Bay Area!<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

We always have an amazing meal at Scottie's!  I told him I was going to need something low carb and he told me what he could do to adjust items on the menu and made my a perfect dinner.<//Text>

This place is a gem. Elegant, simple, and full of class, you wouldn't expect to run across something like this in the outskirts of Brentwood. French cuisine that could run with some of the better French-style restaurants I've come across. Went there for just the dessert menu - and I left impressed.</Review>

Been waiting to try this place and finally decide to go for lunch. We get there and it’s closed even though the hours are posted on google claiming they’re open from 12-2pm for lunch.</Text>

Everything had a tarragon taste to it and the restaurant was too warm. It was our anniversary wanted to go someplace special so we chose Scottie's. Disappointed,  sugget some Edit Piaf and french music for atmosphere. OMG the bill was $172.06. Insult to injury.</Text>< Gmap_id>

This year's thanksgiving was very disappointing compared to last year. At $50. A plate, prime rib was well done and lumpy mashed potatoes were lumpy. I guess this will be our last thanksgiving there😣< /Review>

<Review>Food was outstanding! Service was great. On the pricy side but you get what you pay for.  I didn't feel ripped off.

It's also in an industrial area but it's Brentwood so does it really matter?  Not that big of a deal. If you want fancy locations, sit in an hour and a half worth of traffic and head to SF.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<review>I'm so sad tonight was such a disappointment. We went a year ago, and it was a 5 star experience. This time, the food was not nearly as good and dinner service was extremely slow. We sat there for 45 mins after we finished our appetizer as waiting for our main dishes to come out.

Last year, I had the escargot appetizer, and it was the most amazing version of escargot I've ever had. This year, it tasted like cleaning fluid and rancid nuts. I had to send it back, and I NEVER send back dishes. It was just inedible.

The duck breast was good and cooked perfectly, but the flavor combinations on the plate were poorly done. The black rice risotto had little flavor. The mushrooms were under cooked and didn't feel like a good part of the dish. And I'm a mega fan of mushroom risotto. But honestly, a frozen bag from Trader Joes tastes better.

Unfortunately, tonight was such a turn off, I don't think we will be going back ever again. I'm so sad, last year was amazing. I have a deep love for French quizine. I don't know if management changed or just the chef, but this was no where near as good as it was a year ago.<//review>< pictures>

Our meal on July 4th was amazing.  With the one exception of broth for mussels being a bit saltier than we'd like, all the dishes were winners - Chicken Cordon Bleu, Beef/Pork meatloaf, Bone-in pork chop, Duck confit were the entrees.  Sides were delicately prepared and seasoned to match.  Sauces were French-style savory reductions.  Desserts!  Fabulous!  Chocolate Fondant, Creme brulee cheesecake (not sweet - firm, rich, creamy), Fruit tart (warm, crumby, almond background like marzipan).  Not a cheap date, but a top pick for Brentwood.< /review><UserId.>105026241179861988887< /UserId.>< Name>

Found this on the Internet by searching for new restraunts near Brentwood, so we were not sure what what to expect. Our meals were absolutely perfect down to the last green bean and the service was attentive, friendly and helpful, extending to the wine selection, which also was a bery good Pinot Noir. The owner even came by to introduce himself and to see if we needed anything.
We are taking some friends for lunch soon and so hoping our experience was not a fluke.
Just excellent! Will try to remember menu specifics for our second review.<//review>

Overpriced, overcooked, and under seasoned, and in no way is a lava cake a soufle.</Review>

What a gem!!!! So peaceful and lovely here. The buildings are so cared for. The docents are so knowledgeable. Not many know about this place. Support history, not destroy it.< /text>

This place is such an underrated gem. There are two houses with their own tours given at staggered hours. We went on both tours and it is well worth it. If you grew up in in the SGV, you'll recognize so many familiar names that now adorn streets, schools, and other municipal buildings. It was really great to see history come alive and to learn about the people who made a huge impact on the region but that I only knew very casually.< /Text>

<Text>The Workman and Temple Family Homestead Museum is part of LA's "Passport 2 History" program!  If you don't know what that is, please look it up as there are over 80 participating museums, that give you stickers when you go there and there are actually prizes the more you go to.  It's a fun way to learn about museums.

The museums in the P2H program range in their grandiosity, from very small adobes to full scale art museums.  I was expecting the former, but we go much closer to the latter!  They're not fooling around here, and they're constantly growing and renovating.  They had quite an impressive visitor's center where you wait for the tour (complete with free coffee - a part of the history lesson of the community's prohibition ties).  If you get there early, you can enjoy the koi pond (with an impressive soft shell turtle among the large fish and other turtles) and graveyard.

There are two tours - The Workman House and the second house next door (that's name escapes me at the moment).  We only had time for the first tour (each is 45 minutes and we had a 5 year old with us), but it was very cool and informative.  The exhibits are kind of bare in comparison to other homestead museums, where there are more artifacts from the home - but I think there is much more of that in the second home that we missed.  AND there is a behind the scenes tour where they take you in the basement and second floor!  The best part... ALL of these tours are FREE!!!  That's right!  They even have a cute little gift shop that actually has interesting relevant items and toys that are reasonably priced!  So we got some old time candy sticks and a slide whistle because... why not?!?

I know this may be out of the way for many... but make a day trip out of it!  We visited here, The Puente Hills Mall (The Twin Pines Mall from Back To The Future!!! - Be sure to go inside and check out the Twin Pines Mall sign inside the mall!), The Hsi Lai Temple (SUPER cool place that is very welcoming to visitors), a tamale shaped building, the Armenian Martyrs Memorial and more!< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLgMnZHN3ocCSo8ocl8fVUcDP3Ab-4AgK_Syfo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOTmFH4gtNAMdKKbwuATMoMd-TS4FgGLUZbkqpN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMi9XdZsOOQB7yqnwnFqJRJOaWZpmu3Pj7qNSRe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHbBPlgz99Q06ftwOnSgpoDNXY6wRqWnbpof1z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZcYETt1C_Rfss_2lV_lUmd40H-EYIC-6c2gJi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

What a historical place to learn about California's history in the city of Industry. It's a great place to take your kids and students to show and explain how those lived once before. Showing them culture, history, architectural building that no longer exist. Showing people how we've came so far in so short of a time when we had to survive to live rather then how it is now with all this technology.< /review>

We go during the Victorian and 1920 festival. The grounds are beautiful as well as the homes. It is a must see. You will be transported back to another time.< /Text>

Workman and Temple Family HM is a historic house museum once owned by the Workman and Temple families. It is a hidden gem. Glad we visited this place! The museum has free tours of La Casa Nueva and Workman House both last up to 40 minutes. This museum is rich in cultural history and 19th century architecture. Tour guides were deeply knowledgable and professional. First, we toured the La Casa Nueva of Temple family which is a Spanish colonial revival style house built in 1923. he home (9,000 square feet, as built, with 2,000 square feet (190 m2) of dormitory space constructed in 1930 for a military school using the home) contains twenty-six rooms, including nine bedrooms, six bathrooms, a barber shop, commercial size electric cold storage unit, basement with a late 1870s bank vault for storage, and other notable features such as hand painted designs on windows as well as a vibrant use of stained glass of the period. Mr. Temple is a bit fond of world history, hence, he had some historical figures all over the house. Its main entrance door has architectural design of twisting grape vines, eagles, wheat and the royal crown of Spain. Upon entry you'll be at the central lobby of the house with huge chandelier, stained glass window center and four enormous oak wood doors (two on the left and two on the right) that leads to different section of the house. The Workman house has broad outlines, including large porches on the north and south sides. Its foundation is made out of adobe, a natural hardened mud soil. The house had unique basement entrance on the front porch where all the cooking was done which serves as the central heating system for the house. Overall, I highly recommend you visit this house museum.<//text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Amazing! We arrived late, just after close. The security guard was shocked to see us (the parking lot was empty). We explained our quest and he graciously gave us a private tour of the cemetery -buried inside was Pio Pico. The site is amazing, the history is fantastic. This adjoins a large park so kids had fun running around as well.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Trees 🌲 gone.
Initial tour with Mr. Lin and secondary with the delightful Cecilia Lombardi and third with Tony C. Thanks for the hospitality, private tour and answering my many questions. Hi to Michelle! Lovely trees.

1917 La Casa Nueva
Architects: Walker & Eisen
Builder: Sylvester J. Cook
Style: Spanish Revival
Windows by Wallis
Tile by Pedro Sanchez
Blessed by Reverend Cantwell 1923

1870 Workman House
Architect Ezra F. Kysor
Initial home built by William Workman.

F. 1850's
El Campo Santo
One of the finest kept monuments to honor the Workman/Temple families. Notice the detail on the rod iron for the inner cemetery for family. Craftsmanship on the Grecian Mausoleum is superb.

Director of this Museum is Author/Historian/Cal State Fullerton graduate Paul R. Spitzzeri who is an Award of Merit book winner.  The arbor of lovely trees is gone and I am thankful for the stroll, shade and beauty they provided many for decades. Grateful.< /text>

Go get yourself a house special pastrami on rye with all of the spicy fixings. You will NOT be sorry - unless you are susceptible to heartburn. Horseradish, pepperoncini, spicy brown mustard, and more made this the most delicious pastrami sandwich I've ever had.... and I grew up on the East Coast.

I went in to the NH deli because I knew (from many past experiences) that they have quick, tasty, inexpensive sandwiches that are made with fresh ingredients (meats and cheese sliced in house, salads made there, refrigerator case clean and well kept, etc.). I can also grab a drink and some chips, or a gnome, apron, Swedish rolling pin, or kipper whilst there, if I need to.

Anyway, I planned to order my standard turkey on rye, but to my delight there was a special that day and OH MY GOD. Life changed.  Took that baby to the park and my poor daughter proceeded to watch me eat the whole thing and then try to roller skate with her. I gotbthere, eventually.  It was worth it. Please, go get this sandwich!</Text>

My only experience with Nordic and Swedish fare was at the Norway Pavillion in EPCOT Orlando FL.

This place brought me back and MORE!

My first and favorite sandwich ive ever had was recommended by the owner.

If youd like one, ask for:

Traditional Danish Sandwich Without Cheese:

Roast beef
Lettuce
House Remoulade
House relish
Fried onions

You can order ahead and pick up.</Review>

<Review>Stocking a wide range of things of Scandinavian origin and themes. Their deli sandwiches are like a Thanksgiving meal, and the atmosphere is cheery like that too.  A great place to find a little sanctuary perhaps to re-connect with a beautiful time in one's life.<//Review><userid>118083360620840340940< /userid>< Pics>

<text>Yes, you can get a license plate surround announcing, for instance, that you're a Finn or (gasp!) a Swede, but that's nowhere near the top of the list of reasons to shop here. As I write this, traditional Scandinavians are beginning to jam the place for traditional foods of the winter celebrations. You can get almost all of it during the rest of the year, too: select cheeses, sausage, herring, crisp-bread, and way more. There are books celebrating traditions and more, some folk objects, and a decently-sized collection of specialty confections like non-nutritionally-correct (salt) licorice. I think the deli counter sandwiches are an under- appreciated gem, especially if the special of the day rings for your taste buds.<//text>< Gmap_id>

This was a nice shop full of Scandanavian goodies! We picked up quite a few Scandanvian decorations, chocolate and goodies such as glogg and stroopwaffel. They also have specialty meats and cheeses. We would love to come again and pick up some more goodies. It's a small store but there is a variety of specialties to take a look at.< /Review>

I love coming in here, especially during the holidays. My family has been in the US for a long time, but spending 5 minutes in here makes me want to take Swedish lessons and make cookies. Very friendly folks who run the shop and lots of items from prepared foods, to packaged and frozen foods as well as housewares, books and candy!<//review>

Amazing customer service. Excellent deli selections. Potato salad is perfect. Roast beef is beyond amazing and they make it themselves. Definitely get a sandwich. Great selection of Nordic groceries and retail.</text>

<review>Very friendly crew that was happy to assist with any inquiries. They offered samples of their house made delicacies, which were really tasty! We ordered a couple sandwiches and enjoyed them on the premises. Don't forget to pick up some house meats or pickles to-go! The meat counter is great! Plenty of trinkets for the kitchen and the holidays. Many Scandinavian pride items too. Unique imported candies and treats. Definitely worth visiting and re-visiting!< /review><time>1543626560206</time><GmapID>0x80857e8cd302b45f:0x857fa42479e3cba2<//GmapID><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< userid>

<text>The store is very clean and well organized. The clerk/owner(?) Was very attentive and kind. The prices are a little high, but the items are all specially imported, so that isn't a huge surprise. I'm mostly vegetarian, but their sandwiches sound pretty bomb!  I will definitely be here again when I have a little more money to drop! 😁</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Amazing to have this place. My Mom's whole side is from Norway and have been coming to Nordic house since 1990. I heard it's closing and that was heartbreaking. I try and make it out from the foothills every year. I hope they stay in business somehow.</text>

They even gifted us licorice  ... as an old swedish friend once advised me only eat it when you feel like crying.

Comfort foods for the homesick soul. I'm North German, and this place is hitting it close enough. One cannot underestimate the joy of recognizing a familiar brand on the shelf, or discovering a holiday decorations or candy remembered from childhood, calling up a moment with your grandfather.</review>

I'm baffled by the comments about price. As a small importer (not Ikea) their prices are reasonable for the quality of the products being imported from Scandinavia (one of the more expensive places in the world). The service is great, the people knowledgeable and the sandwiches are always a home run. #Shoplocal< /Text>

Extremely rude! Went there to get a sandwich. I was the only one inside and when I was ordering my sandwich two other people walked in and the guy behind the counter quickly stopped and went to help the other people.
The excuse he gave me was that I should write on a piece of paper what I wanted on my sandwich.
What nonsense. I wanted to patronize local small business and get this type of service is very bad.</text>

<time>1380768842579</time><Rate>5</Rate><review>I used to go this market regularly when I lived in the East Bay and really miss it! Even though I have no relationship to Scandinavia whatsoever and haven't so much as visited the land I choose to idealize (don't worry, it's near the top of my list of things to do before I die), for some reason I've always been drawn to all things Scandinavian. Some of my favorite recipes are Scandinavian in origin and the ingredients can be tough to find. I love visiting Scandinavian shops and wander in whenever I stumble on one, so I've been to quite a few for comparison. This one is a mecca, especially for imported foods. All of the staples are here, including one of my favorite things ever - delicious frozen lingonberries.

The prices are not expensive, but actually totally average for a Scandinavian market.<//review>< pictures>

Excellent place for everything Scandinavian and Baltic but prices are steep. Excellent smoked salmon and herrings from Norway and Sweden.</Text>

If you want to see old Scandinavian people run for their, "I can't get it anywhere else favorites" of the food and nic-nacks  they grew up on. .. because when the doors open, walkers and cute shopping carts go flying. We'll this is the place. I've been going to the Nortic House for 25 years I think.
Thanks to Peter (RIP) and Piea and crew for keeping it going. Thanks!<//Text>

Absolutely THE best place for Danish goods, Assortment is outstanding and the home made meat products are as good as any you'll find back home. I would put their flæske leverpostej to the taste test against the best Salling has to offer anytime.  Prices I find reasonable, sure they are higher than products in a regular supermarket, one should expect them to be so.
Guys, keep it up, our Danish cravings will never stop and you are the solution.< /Text>

<Text>I have ordered Esrom from Nordic House in the past and have been very satisfied. However, my last order was not the Esrom that I have known for the 30 years I've been enjoying my favorite cheese. Upon calling them, I was told that the order they received was not as "aged" as it normally is and therefore is much milder. Perhaps that is true, but milder or not, it didn't even approach the Esrom flavor that I'm familiar with. And if that was the case, why wasn't I informed of that before the order was shipped? Also, I've never received Esrom from anyone without the outer foil wrapping. My 2 pound brick from Nordic House had NONE. I asked for some "credit" on future purchases and was told "No, we don't do any refunds." Then I was told that they all tried it and loved it. Really? Beware when buying Esrom from Nordic House. You may want to call to verify it's 'age" first. And not offering even a dime of credit for a returning customer is not a good way to foster good will and future business.< /Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<review>It is now the only place you can get Scandinavian food in the east bay as Ikea has opted to quit selling any candies or food(that is recognizable as Scandinavian(probably made in China)). This is also a better location than the downtown Oakland location.  Store seems less cramped. Headed there today so will report back again.  Prices are high but with more customers maybe they will bring them down.

Woman running the shop was very rude, and asked me to prove my dog was a service dog (which is against the law.) I have recently had surgery and need my service animal with me, but upon entering the store she tells me "oh that's not a service dog."  There were literally zero customers in this store, which makes sense because their prices are too high and they are rude.</review>

This company sent me Mark Sanders' (pest inspector) and I can say that I'm fully satisfied in his work in inspecting the house that I will buy. He was very detailed when checking the house. He also gave me all the information and suggestions that will help me later on. He exceeded my expectations and I highly recommend him. I'm glad I got to work with Mark Sanders.</review>

<text>The team was punctual, thorough, and professional.  Their adherence to COVID protocol was great and respectful.  Most importantly,  when it came time for the verbal report out,  the results were explained at a level I could understand.  Although the findings weren’t awesome,  the inspector made them very easy to visualize and prioritize.  Thank you Defender!<//text>< pictures>

Used them for a VA inspection they are a great company to work with they arrived promptly and took great care in the findings and recommendations.

Very friendly, staff is knowledgeable, and the shop looks small on the outside but step in and its large and very well organized. 10/10 will be a main shop to go to from now on :)<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80d95504c8615059:0x731fe19b63e39d43<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<rating>4<//rating><Text>Well followers of this humble google guide, this store owners time to be reviewed is nigh. And long-overdue. Angel, the owner of Brute Force Games, is a quiet man, very focused on his business , and customers enjoyment! He is fair and straight forward with you. Patience, is the word that comes easily to mind, when your Google Guide thinks to find a fair description of him, and his staff.
I would have liked to have seen a second floor with a small coffee service. WHAT? I can’t think of anything to complain about!!

<text>Love this place. They have raised prices on PKMTCG products but they prices are still better than most places. The owner is a cool dude and is always in a good mood and the staff is always making jokes. Great place and I would love to keep supporting it!

Only thing I can say, their online inventory is pretty hit-or-miss. I can look online and see nothing, then they’ll have a few things in store. I hate having to call them to check but that’s the only way to guarantee it. Even then they’re so nice it’s not even a big issue. Support them!<//text>< Pics>

Sean and his crew run an awesome shop, geared mostly towards Magic the Gathering players. Always friendly and offers a lot of great products, including board games, accessories, and plenty of card singles.<//Review>

They're taking super serious precautions for COVID (one customer inside at a time, and there was only one employee as well) so I felt very safe going into the store. The employee was very knowledgeable and nice and helped me get what I was looking for, and chatted about upcoming releases.<//Review>

A great place to visit! Huge open indoor spaces, fantastic selection of cards, sleeves, deckboxes, and other board games.

Honestly, I can't wait till we're out of this pandemic, and I can visit again for a FNM, or another opportunity.</Review>

My wife and I came to this store first time and only time. This is also my first time in Cali. We walked in with masks and then asked by employee behind counter to step outside so we did expecting it being because of Covid and they must have a max limit of people to go into store. Also, only one person was in the store shopping so I guess their max is one??... I'm a fan of MTG and this store has great reviews so I expected the best. Some guy pulls up to store and walks in. My wife and I expected he would have to wait outside too but he was allowed right in. I don't know if this is some sort of discrimination but we were upset and reason why I'm giving this place one star. I don't appreciate wasting gas and time to be told to stand outside and not being treated fairly. I truly hope this place can change how they treat people.< /review>

{'time': 1604090765294, 'text': "Hi Melissa, I'm sorry you had a poor experience with us. I got some clarification on this situation from the staff member working that day, he mentioned the person who walked in was told to wait outside as quickly as he could tell him, as he was also answering questions for customers looking at board games. By that point you had already left, likely in frustration. Our current policy doesn't allow multiple groups of people in the store, but on occasion, people will just walk in despite signage saying otherwise, and we try and deal with it the best we can. If you're still in California we hope you'll give us another chance in the future. If you have any other questions or concerns please feel free to reach out to me at cs@bruteforcemtg.com\n\nRegards,\n\nSean (owner)"}</resp>

COVID only allows 1 person in the store at a time but they were helpful over the phone in finding exactly what I needed and bringing it to me to make the checkout quick. Hours are 1-7pm everyday at the time of this posting.<//review>

It is a great place to play Magic the Gathering, especially the Commander format. If you play and are looking for cards, chances are you will find some of what you need here. It can get crowded, however they are willing to make room for more players when they can. Any credit earned there is good for any product they sell, so you can spend your event earnings how you want to. I recommend this LGS to anyone who enjoys casual atmosphere and good players.<//Review>

Visiting from out of town checking out local shops. Nice, clean, well lit. Very friendly helpful staff. Great card selection and pretty good board game selection as well. Gameplay area with tables seems nice, although we didn't stay and play any tournaments. Would happily visit again if in back in this area.<//review>

<time>1556567561276< /time><Review>Amazing time! I had my first in store tournament Saturday for the war of the spark prerelease. I've always been intimidated about the idea of playing in a shop because I don't feel I have the same knowledge or experience as most players I assume do events at shops. Everyone there, staff and players, made me feel like a part of. I never felt like my lack of knowledge was an issue. Everyone was more then willing to help me with my deck, explain how the tournament works, and help me understand cards. I was blown away at how amazing and fun everything was. I went into the event thinking I would have fun and let a bunch of people get some basically free wins from me, but I actually ended up winning because of the help I got with my deck. I am so grateful to Sean for creating a shop with such an amazing and welcoming atmosphere that even someone new like me could come in and have an amazing, welcoming, and encouraging experience. I would highly recommend them to anyone of any skill level. Amazing place!!!<//Review><pics>None< /pics><user_name>Amber Martinez< /user_name>< resp>

Great experience at Brute Force Games. Came in twice to sell cards and their staff was very professional and helpful. Additionally, their bonus for in-store card sales credit is second to none.< /Review>

I've been coming to Brute Force since before the new location and I don't see myself going anywhere else! Amaaaazing inventory, great prices, and incredibly friendly and helpful staff. If you're ever in the area and are looking for a place to play or to pick up some packs or singles, definitely check them out!</Text>

My local FLGS. I've been playing Magic since Revised so I've been to a lot of gaming stores in my life. I've never felt more welcome anywhere, period. They know my name and say hello every time I come in. They are amazing. I always buy from them before the interwebs, they're the kind of people that you feel happy to spend a few more bucks to support.</Review>

Awesome staff, very knowledgeable about their products. It’s nice to browse online and come pick up the cards in house. They will special order you dice or boxes if they don’t have what you want.<//review>

I've been going to this store every weekend for the past 2 months. I haven't had a single bad experience yet. Every employee has been kind to anyone who had a question, or wanted help with some. Singles and packs are offered at competitive prices, I'd say if you choose store credit then you get around 75% the tcgplayer value. Since I've been going, drafts are $11 with each win getting you a free pack. The players have all been great in my experience too. I'm not a veteran, so I've had players help me from time to time, and nobody has been rude to me yet. Overall, it's a fantastic store that I can't recommend enough!</review>

<review>Went one day with my family and have been sending people there ever since. Great customer service, extremely helpful, and all around what I look for in a card shop. Sean the owner has created a great atmosphere for players and I look forward to future visits as well as hearing from others about the great recommendation.<//review>< Pics>

The staff is friendly, they have events I want to attend, They accept store credit for events and you can look up their buylist in store! It's a smaller shop,but the community here is welcoming and there's always good conversation and laughs to be had, plus a large selection of cards at your disposal. Their prize structure is great, Never a bad time.<//Review>

While I haven't been to his location, since I live a continent away, I've dealt with BFG numerous times. They've always been fair, and respectful when buying cards, not something other stores can say they are. If I was ever in the San Diego area, hands down BFG would be my first choice for playing MtG! Cheers!!!</text>

Alex, Matthew, and Jesse provided above exceptional service through great communication. Shortly after submitting a Kelly Blue Book instant cash offer online, the Future Auto Sales team contacted me to schedule an appraisal. The appraisal team was extremely professional and provided a fair offer for my vehicle. With the service being so exceptional, I recommended their business to colleagues and friends.<//text>

Very pleased with my experience.  Alex was professional,  kind, courteous. We purchsed a vehicle quickly. I have spent 5-6 hours at a dealership.  In 2 hours the process was complete.  Highly recommend.</review>

<text>If I could give 0 star, I would. I experienced a very poor customer service with an agent here. I was walking in to this branch and spoke with an agent. I was asking if they have some great deals for a premium brand that is within my price range. But he said that they don’t have that much. He showed me 3 cars that are right next to each other. It felt a lil bit frustrating already the way he entertains a customer that’s why I decided not to spend anymore time with him. My frustrations even got worse when I went home, browse their website and found so many great deals of the brands that I was looking for and that is within my price range.<//text><rating>1<//rating>< time>

<text>Just leased my 3rd car from Future Auto Sales, and I couldn't be any happier with my purchase. I went in unsure of what car I wanted for my next car, and David was very helpful in showing me cars in my budget and was very knowledgeable in the field. He showed me a few cars and was very patient throughout the entire process. The rest of the staff was very welcoming and friendly as well. Overall, I LOVE my new car, the color, and the way I was treated at Future Auto Sales.

Thank you to everyone at Future Auto Sales!< /text>< Pics>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><time>1598503507037< /time><Review>Purchased a 2016 Fiat 500X from FAS and I’m delighted with the car and the whole buying experience. Matthew answered my first call to the dealership and was the most well-mannered and helpful Salesperson I had spoken to while enquiring about cars at various local dealers. We scheduled a test-drive and Matthew welcomed my husband and I at the lot, he was polite, knowledgeable and not-at-all pushy. To finalize the purchase we dealt with another Sales Manager and Financial Officer who were both very friendly and efficient. We were told we could bring the car to the FAS Burbank service center if there were any issues (30-day warranty). After 2 weeks I had noticed the brakes were squeaky so I took the car to the shop in Burbank and they cleaned the break pads and serviced the car free of charge. Again, the guys were super-friendly and efficient. Thank you FAS! The car’s going great and I paid a fair price with total peace of mind = one very happy customer :)<//Review><UserId.>111077899399144127059</UserId.><username>Google User<//username></record>

<review>From the moment I started communicating with this Dealership, they displayed the highest level of honesty, integrity, communication, and efficiency. This was my first car purchase on my own (BMW M3), and they made the entire experience a pleasure and easy. I must also mention that the car I bought is in excellent shape and better than described and anticipated. I will be coming back in the future and telling my friends and family about this dealership.</review>< Pics>

I sold my car to Future Auto Sales in March. Daniel reached out via email at the first place. After I read their Yelp reviews and Google reviews, I decided to give it a shot. My plan was to just get a quote/appraisal. However, Daniel was able to provide an offer that I just can't refuse. It's the best offer among the 5, 6 dealers I checked including the one from CarMax. After I made my mind to sell it, Daniel was able to take care of everything for me including completing all paperwork, contacting my bank for car loan payoff, etc. I've only spent merely 2 hours in the store, it includes the time for the appraisal + car sales paperwork, and I walked out with a check and a happy face. I am very satisfied with the offer and their frustration-free services. Highly recommended! Talk to Daniel for car sales!<//Review>

They actually purchased my CRV at a higher price than what CARMAX was offering and the transaction was made pretty fast. Honda got the payment in less than a week. I will definitely sell my other cars to them in the future.They also have super expensive cars on the lot. It's small but pretty great working with them.< /text>

<review>Great experience buying a car. The dealers were low-pressure and made the entire buying process very easy.  Additionally they went above and beyond and found me an insurance rate that was far lower than anything I was able to find myself. If you tell them your budget and ideals when buying the car they will do whatever is reasonably within their power to make the deal happen within that budget.  Especially given that it's a car dealership, they run an honest business.  I would recommend buying from them.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< userid>

Very nice experience for selling a car! It was my first time selling a car and the staff here were very nice and professional enough to make sure everything is taken care of. The process was smooth and fast. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you sell your car here. They offered VERY REASONABLE PRICE, which was way more than the carmax appraisal. I would recommend go talking to SYDNEY and her supervisor, ARTHUR. They were the best and they made sure I am satisfied with their service. Thank you Sydney and Arthur for such a nice and convenient car selling experience :)< /Review>

<text>Couldn't be any happier with my vehicle from Future Auto Sales. I leased a car from them almost 3 years ago now, and they helped me get into the exact car & trim I wanted. I'm starting to look for my next car with them and they've already been beyond helpful with information.

Excellent service, fantastic prices. Looking forward to my next car!

Great experience! I came to FAS to look at a newer Cayman S (718), and at the same time try to trade in my old Cayman (987).

I was helped by Sydney, who took me for a test drive in the car, and once I was satisfied with the car she worked with me and Arthur (the owner) to come to a deal on both the purchase and the trade-in.

Arthur gave me a great price on my old Cayman, and through some negotiation, we came to a good price on the new car.
While I already had my financing ready to go, Arthur asked to see if they could match the rate I had through my Credit Union. I was fine with this.
They were able to match the exact rate, so everyone wins!

All in all a very positive experience and would recommend buying a car with FAS to anyone. Sydney, Arthur, thank you!< /text>

<name>Yes Enia</name><response>None</response><Text>I received an offer of 22k at CarMax right before everything was shut down due to covid. I went back to CarMax to get my car appraised again but this time they only wanted to give me 20k. Luckily I wasn’t in a hurry to sell my car so I’m didn’t accept that offer. I went to Kelley blue book to get a quote “just for fun” bc  I didn’t think they would offer me more than CarMax but I wanted to get a second opinion before I gave up in selling my car. I thought that I was selling my car to Kelley blue book and once I got an email to get it appraised at a location affiliated with them I just thought they would Just inspect it and send pictures to Kelley blue book. Ha! I called and spoke to Daniel and  made an appointment for the same day. My husband was not a happy off going somewhere else because he thought it was a waste of time because they wouldn’t give us a range of what the offer would be over the phone. I personally didn’t see an issue I understand that they need to inspect the vehicle, but my husband didn’t see it that way. So I made him go with me and luckily it paid off they inspected my car and after some negotiation they offered me more than CarMax. I went in on a Saturday and we did the paperwork and left my car there that day today is Wednesday and I checked my car loan and It has been paid off !!! Wohoo!</Text></record></dataset><record>

I recently had the pleasure of purchase a 2010 Honda Insight Hybrid from FUTURE AUTO SALES.  From the moment I walked onto the lot the sales personnel were helpful, personable and willing to answer all my questions.  They told me the particulars of the vehicle and the price was absolutely spot on for my budget.  The vehicle though a few years old is in great condition and care had been put into it by the previous owner and FUTURE AUTO SALES made sure everything was right.  Jesse Rubio and the entire staff were there to answer any question and calm any concern.  I'd do it again in a heartbeat and have recommended and will recommend FAS to my friends.  Too bad I don't need another car 'cause this is where I would go first.< /text>

I really have nothing but good things to say about this place. The people are helpful, fun and get things done quickly. I stopped in here just to look and ended up buying. We were in and out in 2 hours, which included the test drive!<//Text>

Just purchased a Porsche from them. I live out of state and they were very accommodating. They were very honest and the car is exactly what was for sale online. They didn't hide anything about the car. Over the phone they even told me about a scratch (only flaw). Would recommend.<//review>

I have gotten nothing but AMAZING service from Future auto sales. Jesse the manager and the staff at Future have gone above and beyond any dealership I have experienced. In addition their selection is superb, jaw dropping gorgeous cars in the lot packed to the brim. If you are on the market, consider coming here first you will not be disappointed!!</text>

Don't trust this dealer. They got my information and processed fraudulent application for an auto loan. I found out about that a month later when I received a letter from bank  showing different vehicle information that I have never applied for, neither was interested in.< /Text>

Very welcoming and fair dealership. I was in the market for a Cayman, and after driving several I found the one at FAS. David was a pleasure to work with and they truly only carry top-quality vehicles. Would recommend to anyone.</review>

Great experience from start to finish.   I went in knowing what I was looking for and David, Jesse, Carlos and the staff helped me drive my Volvo off the lot without once feeling haggled or pressured into a sale.  This is how car buying should be.  Thanks guys!< /Review>

<review>I called and asked them to help me out and I submitted my application. I called the next day and asked if they’ve seen it and said it was pending, guy on the phone said he’ll let me know by the end of the day. It’s been 3 days since then. I guess they don’t care about customers who are interested in buying a car, even though they said they wanted to help me out.< /review><date>1568605590079</date><Name>Alex Cortes<//Name>< response>

<text>I really love my car but so sad I have to let it go. I went to some dealership but ended up Future Auto Sales. They offer higher prices in the area for the quality pre-owned car. Emin is really really helpful, detailed and nice. He did help me go through the whole process and documentation. It's a very reliable auto dealership. I really recommend Future Auto Sales for people who considers vehicle sold.<//text><Gmap_id>0x80c2c0dfc9fee7d7:0xba8b55fccf6c1b65</Gmap_id><Rate>5< /Rate>< pictures>

VERY PLEASANT EXPERIENCE!!!  My salesman was John... He was very polite and knowledgeable. I didn't feel pressured into buying a car.. All the cars are low miles and very nice... Finance person Jesse was very nice also.. I drove away in a VERY nice car with a low monthly payment.. They met all my needs I told them exactly how much I wanted to put down payment and monthly payment and they got me lower than what I expected... Thank you Future Auto will come again to get another car!!!👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍< /review>

<text>I have never had a worse experience buying a car. We were offered a deal on a truck and accepted. We completely rearranged our work schedules to pick up the truck as well as made plans to sell our other car. They contacted my husband the morning of, VERY last minute, to tell us the price went up almost $2,000 which is unacceptable for truck was under 10k to begin with. Extremely disappointing in this experience and will make sure to tell friends not to come here.< /text>< Resp>

I give Future Auto Sales in Glendale 5 Star because they helped me get the car I wanted even though I had bad credit. I didn't feel pressured to purchase anything other than the beautiful Lexus IS 250 that I got. Amin and Jesse were both awesome abd I would recommend Future Auto to any of my friends or family!!

Future Auto Sales is a really good dealer with awesome selection of cars. I bought my Lexus from here almost a year ago, to this very day I've had no issues with the car. My sales person was Alex and he's truly a classy guy who went out of his way to make sure I was satisfied with the purchase. Financing was a snap as well and everything was wrapped up very quickly. I traded my car and drove off the lot with my new car within hours. Thank you to everyone @ future auto sales for such a smooth transaction.<//Review>

Bought a 335i from these guys.  I know these cars _can_ be high maintenance and if you want a low maintenance car get a Toyota.  I love my BM-trouble-you and I would buy another if I had room in the garage.  Thank you FAS for selling me the perfect Le Mans Blue 335i.</text>

Really honest dealer. I took my car for a pre-purchase inspection and they confirmed me all what I had heard. There were a couple of minor points that I discovered after the inspection and a couple of medium ones (a dent and a possible issue with the alternator that could come up in few months), but nothing serious. Nothing unexpected for a pre-owned car (in my case a BMW convertible with hard top). I was given all the information  I needed (technical, financial). They helped me with tinting the windows, taking the car to a car shop for an inspection, etc ... All the agents are great, but, Carlos Gomez, in particular was outstanding. If I had to buy another car, I would first call them. I took business cards with me for my friends and colleagues. They also have a car shop in Burbank with great deals for the customers. Ah, and the deal was really fair and good. If I don't come back in few months, this purchase was a total success.< /text>

Good friend had to get a lien removed from his car which required a lot of leg work from Jesse and his guys. Although he was busy, he knocked it out for him right away. I would recommend these guys if you're in the SoCal< /text>

I went here with my uncle to get his Porche. The customer service was friendly and as well and professional. No Hassel or pressure from the sales person. They seem to really take care of you and treat you well and almost as a friend. I would recommend to friends or family if they were to get exotic or sports car here.</review>

<Text>I had a bad experience trying to sell a car here. John on the phone told me that they could get close to the $4k price I wanted for my truck if it was in the condition I listed. Initially via email he had said the range was $2-4k. I had not mentioned some minor scratching/denting on one side. On arriving he had me wait "5-10 minutes" while Kelly blue book ran the info (I thought KBB was instant), and then offered $1500. Then I went through 4-5 more rounds of things that all took 5-10 minutes, different people looking at the car or 'making calls' (all took about 12 minutes) then when I rejected the $1500, they said 'let's see what the manager can do'. Manager never talked to me, but John came back and said now they can do $2k, so I walked out. Seemed like an algorithmic rehearsed set of sales tactics to try to take advantage of someone in a pinch needing to sell their car. John tried connecting with me at the end and he has a very nice set of interests, but I still felt like my time was wasted and I was communicated with in-genuinely during the whole process.<//Text><Name>Joshua Robbins< /Name><time>1540570017014</time>< rating>

This review is of the car and customer service
summery: they are a bunch of sleezy salesman trying to make a quick buck and will lie and manipulate you. Bought the car they said there mechanics did some basic things like a look over and oil change. They didnt once I fixed the fuses the next day I had a engine check light. Im gonna have to spend more money then what I bought the car for.
DO NOT GO HERE THERE TERRIBLE.

Car
Bought a used car from them about 3 months ago. In those 3 months I drove less then 1,000 miles and probably spent 1,200 bucks fixing it out and now it looks like the engine just blew out for no reason I drove the car calmly knowing it was a used car and already had problems. I need to replace the soft top roof because there is a hole in it which I only noticed couple days later when it rained. The best part it was missing almost every single fuse and needed an oil change. So not only do I have to pay 7,000 to get it in drive-able condition they didn't even do what they said they did like an oil change and a basic inspection and fix like fuses. Everything that had to be fixed in 3 months or less is Clutch, slave and master cylinder, fuses, belt and belt tensioner, MAF sensor, Intake hose, timing chain, valve tick (new engine), every single plastic screw for the plastics were missing (idk how i missed that when I was buying it), roof replaced, all the seals replaced, toyota and mr2 emblems, headlights and interior lights. To be honest that is probably more then  7 grand.

The customer service.
Talk about buttering people up. "this car was waiting for someone like you" "this is prefect for you" "you're really getting a great deal"( i got ripped off) and i can keep going. Better yet he kept saying how he does anything and everything to get away from the law while driving and sucks up to people if he has to, just so he doesn't look bad or gets in trouble.< /review>

I just bought a new Alfa Romeo and needed another new car like a hole in the head.  My buddy just bought a Porsche 991 Carrera, and I had a very nice 997 which is the earlier model.  His purchase got my head reeling and I started looking. I saw this incredible 2015 dark blue GTS cabriolet at Future Auto Sales.

Truth be told I'm not too keen on any independent car dealerships in Los Angeles, and I was ready for some type of flim-flam or BS.  Call me skeptical.  Call me cantankerous.  But Arthur the owner was fabulous as were the salespeople including David.  I got a terrific trade in on my Porsche.  Normally I would never trade in my car, but they gave me a great price on the purchase and on the trade in.

They are even refinishing the lower skirt on the Porsche.  It wasn't a cheap purchase at over $100K and I want it to be perfect.

Great people.  As always YMMV.  My experience was super!

EDIT: I was in touch with Arthur shortly after I traded in my 2007 Porsche, and learned that it had a $1500 problem that COULD have been covered under my extended warranty had  I known about it. I felt horrible. The upshot is most dealers may have just sold the car with the problem as it was not easily detectable.  They did not.  I got more honesty and goodwill from these guys than I have from the two Porsche dealers I have done business with.<//Text>

<review>I would love to thank ALEX from future auto sales. Honestly he is one of the best cars sales men i have ever met.Considering i just bought a car September 2012, from a different dealer. Alex is really outgoing and ofcorse a gentleman. I would really recommend him to anyone buying a car from this dealership!. He helped my boyfriend and I on buying our first car. Ford Ranger 2001.My boyfriend is a first time buyer and Alex really worked with us answered all of the questions I had about the truck, contract, and payments. He also had the truck ready for us both to test drive. this dealer ship is a friendly environment. alex makes you feel like family and makes sure that you and 100% comfortable with the down payment and monthly payments before signing any paperwork.Over all my boyfriend and i are 100% satisfied with the outcome of Future Auto Sales.(:</review><UserId.>100633756960312817093</UserId.>< Date>

<text>I recently bought a 2006 Acura TL from Future Auto, I met with Alex V. who provided great customer service, No pressure, Handed me the keys to the car and let me inspect it on my own, He wasn't breathing down my neck while I inspected the car which was a huge plus for me. Checked the car out from top to bottom, inside and out and it was in amazing condition, test drove it and wasn't dissappointed. Jesse in finance handled all the paperwork quickly and was straight forward about everything, Overall I'm very happy with the customer service they provided and with my purchase.<//text>< Resp>

My Daughter and I purchased a car from Future Auto Sales 5 months ago. She spent 2 years riding the bus to college and working really hard to save for a car. She was able to save enough money to purchase a nice car with 40k miles from FAS in cash.

Well, the car has spent more time in the shop than on the road.  20 minutes after driving the car off the lot the transmission malfunction. They were nice enough to pick up the car and repair/replace the transmission at no cost.  3K miles later, the transmission malfunction again.  After the transmission was inspected by the adjuster from the warranty company and my own mechanic, they found RUST inside the new used transmission provided by FAS.
A rusty transmission was installed on the car.

Please insist on purchasing the Contract Cancellation Option Agreement. The extra 250.00 could save you some headaches.
Per the Finance Manager, "The dealership could not provide this option" therefore I had to sign under the Declined section of the contract.

Don't let this happen to you.  GO TO ANOTHER DEALERSHIP.

I ignored the bad reviews at first because they were so nice. NEVER AGAIN.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Absolutely HORRIBLE. If you purchase a vehicle from this dealership DO NOT DEAL WITH VIC. He's nice at first but then after he starts talking and takes your money is VERY arrogant and ignorant, obviously having no customer service-related skills. I just purchased a 2005 Mercedes C230 Kompressor from this place and there were some things that needed fixed on it so he told us to come back in a week. So my husband called the day before we were coming to get it to make sure it was ready. Vic told us to come on down the next day, so we did. We drove the 3 hours from Ridgecrest only to find out the car was not ready. The manager told us he would bring it to the town next to ours either Monday or Tuesday. I called Monday and I get transferred to Vic. I ask him if my car is coming that day and he starts saying how he never told my husband the car was ready. Why the hell would we drive 6 hours for nothing? And I didn't even ask him that, I just wanted to know if my car was being delivered. So I got transferred to the manager and he said it's probably coming tomorrow. So I call the next day and guess who answers the phone again? Vic. I ask again if my car is coming today as they told me it was, and he tells me he won't say anything. It's been a week and a half, they have my check and I still have no car. Again, if you do decide to purchase a vehicle from this place, AVOID VIC and make sure your car is in good condition before you leave the lot. On a side note, the manager was the only helpful person in this horrible experience.<//Text>< response>

Future Auto Sales, you guys are the best!

Was shopping around for a Mercedes, shopped around to 5 of the major dealerships in Southern California, then came across Future Auto Sales.  They beat all of the dealers pricing hands down.  Not only did they beat their price, they got me a fully loaded one for cheaper then the other dealers quoted me.

The service was incredible.  I put the sales guy through a lot, asking for specific features and options, add-ons, color changes, and so on.  Sales reps name was Alex and he was very professional through out the entire process.  Incredible customer service!  Thank you Alex and Future Auto Sales.  I am soo happy with my Mercedes.

I got a bunch of referrals coming your way now..lol.</review>

I like to tell you about my experience with Future Auto Sales.I met Alex Vini at Future Auto Sales through my niece's boyfriend and let me tell you, Alex and Future Auto Sales will do anything to make you happy.Alex was the most friendly person I have met in years, very patient and was constantly calling people and finding information for me about the truck I wanted.  Future Auto Sales found me a brand new Toyota Tacoma 2012 and had it delivered the same day and it was raining too!  Future Auto Sales also has access to car insurance right there at their facility and got my insured as well!  Look people, because they are a dealer, they can get you the best deal, the right car for the right price.  They are honest and followed through, I had Alex calling me 1 week after I bought my truck to find out how I was doing and how was everything with me and my new truck.I really made new friends at Future Auto Sales, I not only recommend that you visit them, give Alex a call or call Future Auto Sales today and ask for Alex and you won't regret it, he will get the car you want for less and you will be so satisfied, you'll be tanking me, lol.I'm bying my next car at Future Auto Sales!<//Review>

<Response>None<//Response><Review>I went to KBB to get the value of my car and it said my car is worth about $3.7k then it referred me to this dealer and gave me a list of other dealers. I got an email from this dealer immediately after my quote and a call later that day to bring my car in. Marlene was super friendly and made me an appointment for that night and to call back if I couldn't make it. She told me to look for David when I get there.

This lot was full of beautiful cars which surprised me because I thought used car lots would have junky cars. Anyway, David and I took the car around the block, went back to his desk, he asked if I needed a drink then he gave me the KBB value of $1k and showed that to me on his monitor. I didn't want to sell my 2005 Camry XLE for less than $3k. He bumped it up to $1.7k but I still rejected his offer so he had Arthur come to talk to me.

Arthur said it was going to cost him about $2.5k to fix up the roof paint and both of the bumpers. He was very honest because I had checked around on the repair. I was still adamant on $3k so he offered me $2k. I countered offered $2.5k but he refused to budge and told me to sign off my pink slip for $2k. I told me ok if he ubers me home. I switched the topic of selling my car to buying a new used one. He said that he will give me a better deal then the car dealers and that he will show me the invoice and his mark-up so I said where do I sign. He handed me off to Jesse to complete the paper work.

Jesse was very nice, patiently filled out the documents and told me where to sign on the pink slip. I had to go clean out my car of personal items and he came out to hand me the check. There was another salesman that was talking to me while I cleaned out my car and asked if I needed something to put all my stuff in. He came out with a huge box that was perfect!

Arthur came to talk to me and made sure I didn't take the car seats. He's a very funny and friendly guy which makes all the difference in repeat customers. He asked for my address and ubered me home. I went in there at 7pm and got out at 8:45pm. It was a very pleasant and positive transaction from start to finish. They have a customer for life and I'm definitely going to spread my word of mouth. I highly recommended place for it's excellent customer service.<//Review>< Time>

I cannot say enough good things about Future Auto Sales, both Harry my saleman and Jesse Rubios were a huge help in my car buying process from start to finish. I am from Rhode Island and yet they made it so easy I felt as I was getting the car from a local dealer down the road. They took my car to a local Ford Dealer on my request where I had a full inspection done and Ford told me the car was perfect. It means alot when a dealer goes the extra mile for you. Paperwork was well handled and anytime I felt a concern they put my mind as ease and helped with anything I needed. If you are local these are the guys to see and if you out of state you can rest easy in knowing you are buying exactly what they show you and they make what can be a complicated process a breeze!

Thank you to Harry, Jesse and FAS, I love my car and thank you guys for everything!< /Text>

Thank you for the incredible customer experience. This was my First purchase from the dealer and they made it so simple. I found the vehicle on line and sent an opening email and was contacted by Jacob Dutton. Jacob took a very friendly approach to the sales process. I asked about all the trim levels, engine differences, and the option packages. Jacob was very attentive and located the exact car that I had asked for. The entire process was seamless. I arrived and was greeted by Jacob who had the vehicle detailed ready to go. I was introduced to Michael the General Manage. Michael thanked me for my purchase and I really felt his sincerity. I then went into the Buisness office and was greeted by Chayse. The paperwork was explained to me and we discussed some other options to enhance my Land Rover vehicle experience which I absolutely took advantage of. The entire process was within a hour and I felt they really valued my time. Jacob did the product presentation and set up my account with Land Rover, my email address, and cell phone. Thank you again to everyone at the store, job well done !</Review>

<Text>I've had issues with the InControl Land Rover Discovery app since I purchased the vehicle  on April 6, 2021, after dealing with three national service center attempts and three dealership attempts, I was fortunate to get Jacob Dutton to assist in resolving my issue, it took him less than 30 minutes and the app is now working as advertised.  Jacob has a great customer service attitude and personality to go with it, any tech issues, ask for Jacob</Text>< pics>

<Text>I had a FANTASTIC experience here yesterday.  I was having trouble with my nav + mobile connect and Greg and Casey helped me immediately.  They spent the time to resolve the issue and led me through what was still needed.  I got a great education about several functions of the car I was unaware of too (Thank you, Casey). I was impressed. Highly recommend this knowledgeable, friendly team.< /Text>< Pictures>

We always take our Range Rovers to this shop for repairs and maintenance, most recently we had some service issues that we informed the shop management. Even though the service was not up to par, we were impressed with the follow up by their management to deal with the issue. I was also impressed that they read the reviews posted on their website and take it seriously and follow up with corrective measures.< /Text>

<Review>INDIGO Land Rover-Rancho Mirage sales staff was very professional, friendly and knowledgeable. Gabe made leasing a Land Rover Discovery very quick and smooth. We drove 1 1/2 hrs from Glendora, CA to buy the vehicle. We highly recommend Gabe and this dealership. Worth the drive!

Amazing experience purchasing my Jaguar F Pace! Excellent customer service, and overall top notch staff. I got a great deal on my vehicle and met some of the nicest people. Their level of professionalism was unprecedented! Thanks to Jacob in Sales, Mike in Management, and Chayse in Finance for a memorable and note worthy experience. I will definitely be referring friends and family and they've made a loyal customer out of me!<//Review>

Best Customer Service! I arrived to my appointment and was quickly attended. I see how they have made changes to protect their customers with social distancing and everyone wearing masks. In addition, I didn’t have to sign like before to avoid touching their paperwork. Overall, the fastest and best customer service experience.</review>

I am pleased with the service here. They took care of a minor recall and called me later the same day to pick up my “freshly washed “ car.

Side note- My Jaguar XF is the best car I’ve owned and I have owned most brands (American, Japanese, and German) over my lifetime!!

This is a great place to get service. The adviser was able to show me how to use the radio screen. So I didn't have to spend money on something that wasn't broken. They also paid attention to my needs and made sure I got my car back quickly. They must have some of the best technicians. To get me back in my car that fast. Thanks for the coffee and doughnuts too.

There was a used vehicle which I saw via the website, and I got to test drive the vehicle, and the price was very fair. The whole process took about 2 + hours, but I guess that is expected especially in the holiday season. I've not purchased a vehicle personally for almost 20 years. Typically, I have a broker who gets the best deal for me. So I didn't know what to expect, but the entire process was rather simple and straightforward. There were a lot of great vehicles with this dealer, I probably will recommend those considering Land Rover to visit this dealer.</Review><Resp>{'time': 1577731221020, 'text': 'Thank you for the great review!

< Review>
While others can purchase A SUV over the phone from this dealership, the salesman bragged about this!
I have to resort to legal action.
I have gotten lied to over and over again.
They mis-spelled my name even though I texted it to them.
They said they would call back and give me a out the door price along with pictures and yet failed to do.
So unlike others: I have get legal representation in order to be able to purchase a SUV from this dealership? Should that be even necessary?
But to some that is the only way to be heard I guess.
I am sure others will not have a hard time or such difficulty if they like how you look?
If I could give no stars that would more appropriate. But in order to write down what I have to say, I have to give a very undeserving one star.
This is 2020 and everyone should be treated fair and not lied to like it is a common occurrence.</Review>

Service experience is good not great. But I’m used to Lexus service which has always been 5 star. Jaguar isn’t ready with the loaner car. It’s a 2 step process. The loaner is always dirty. And it takes awhile to get an appointment. I love my car but you would expect a luxury car to have 5 star service. They could improve.</text>

A high-class experience from start to finish!

I was shopping for a new RR Velar P380 R-Dynamic HSE and I contacted at least 5 dealers in SoCal, but Rancho Mirage was just the best in every measurable degree.

My salesman was Cody Dreier and he responded quickly to my online inquiry. He answered some questions I had, he sent a spec sheet, we negotiated a deal, and I was able to place a deposit; and all of this happened over the phone on the same day!!! Throughout the process, Cody was very professional and had a refreshing, easy-going, no-pressure presence. I flew in a few days later to buy the car and he had it ready inside the client delivery room with a bow on the car. Then, after signing the paperwork, I thought everything was done. Instead, Rancho Mirage surprised me with a one-on-one personal tour with the car's multitude of features; product specialist Bernice helped me set up my phone and infotainment system, show me the driving dynamics available, and answered any questions I had before leaving. Truly a high-class experience from start to finish.

Also worth noting, Rancho Mirage has a very noticeable selection of more customized cars that you really don't see in any of the other dealers in SoCal. You'll find more unique cars on their lot, with exclusive interiors offered by Land Rover, and aesthetic selections that really compliment the car even more.

I definitely recommend Rancho Mirage. Exemplary in salesmanship, professionalism, vehicle exclusivity, presentation, and their ability to provide a personalized, celebrity-level experience. Thank you for making it special.< /Text>

<review>I literally had the best experience I’ve ever had when buying a car. I had top notch service throughout the whole process. I did my research ahead of time and was pleasantly surprised at the price I was offered on the new car as well as my trade in. I knew I was getting a good deal on every aspect of the deal and had no need to haggle. Big thanks to Jacob for taking such good care of me during my vehicle selection, Ray for making the finance quick and painless, and Mike Weibel, for taking the time to say hello and make sure I had the best experience possible. I absolutely love my new 2019 Range Rover Spot HST - sick!< /review><Date>1565789434192<//Date>< Rating>

I’m very disappointed in the customer service, the vehicle, and most of all the lack of sincere interest in wanting to resolve vehicle product technical issues. My car connectivity has not been working in 2 months and jaguar service people don’t know how to fix it. Instead of wanting to replace the entire digital dash? They have not given me assurance the issue will be resolved. I called the manufacturer and they have also yet to return my call backs. The performance of the vehicle is wonderful, but I would not purchase another jaguar nor recommend anyone a jaguar product.</text>

Bought a 2018 Discovery from this dealership. Car advertised as Certified Preowned with up to 7 years or 100k warranty.
While signing paperwork we caught that they added an extra 1k to agreed sale price. Good thing we noticed it, and they acted like it was a typo..

After couple months they charged us $1200 for fixing a broken cable. (Car still has manufacturers warranty) No parts changed. And according to them they fixed the car between 5 and 6 PM, in less than 1 hour.

We called Land Rover Customer service recently and found out that at the time of the sale they did not include Certified Preowned Warranty which was the main reason we bought the car.

Writing this with hope that you can avoid this scammers..< /review>

Excellent experience at the JLR Dealership; from  the extremely clean showroom to the welcome from the receptionist and hand off to my excellent and knowledgeable salesman (Greg), the process from test drives to completing my transaction were seamless and very satisfied with my Jaguar F-Pace deal. One improvement is an increase needed in guest parking spaces.</text>

I purchase a certified vehicle for them while living in another state and while I was somewhat skeptical, Greg, Mike and the entire team at LR Rancho Mirage put my mind at ease. They were incredibly responsive, honest and stood behind their commitments 100%. I looked at quite a few vehicles before buying from Land Rover Rancho Mirage and I’m really glad that I did!</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I brought my 2015 Evoque in for service. I had some questions about the details of the work that was to be done. One of their techs came out to explain the procedure to me. He’s a licensed auto technician with 25 years experience. His explanation was clear and concise. It made me feel much better about bringing my vehicle to this dealership for service.

I will return for service at this dealership in the future.< /text>

Unfortunately my first experience was not great.  I scheduled an appointment 2 weeks in advance for first thing in the morning, so I could drop off and get back with my busy work schedule. When I called at 2pm that day, I was told they still hadn’t started my vehicle, and it would not be started until the next day. In all my years and with many different makes, that has never happened. What made the review negative was there was barely even an apology until I expressed my dissatisfaction. I was too busy to pick up the next day, and they didn’t even offer to deliver. I had to make that suggestion. Quite disappointed of the lack of recognition on their failing.</Text>

We were about to leave, when Jody asked if we needed any help!
So we explained to him what we were looking for, and he searched his cars, and found one in Riverside, and offered to have it brought their dealership. He notified us the next day and we went and test drove it. That was all it took and we were sold. Cody is very friendly and knowledgeable.
Only downside was not being able to use the CUDL system for our loan.
Thanks, Ken</review>

<Text>I live in San Diego and was not happy with the service and selection they had at my local Range Rover dealership. I found Jaguar Land Rover Rancho Mirage online as I searched other dealers. Inventory was great so we decided to take  drive over. I had been in touch with Chaise prior to our meeting in person. He had some of the vehicles I had expressed interest in all lined up and ready for test drives.The day was a great purchase experience largely to to Chaise, and of course my beautiful new car! Chaise spent lots of time with me, no rush, always accomodating. Best new car dealership I ever had. Chaise rocks, call him and you'll agree< /Text>< Pictures>

Worked with Greg for quite some time as I narrowed down my decision. No pressure sale tactics, just provided information and alternatives focused on what I really wanted. He was personable, professional and proficient. Can’t ask for more than that!

Would recommend him and the entire enterprise without reservation. Looking to doing business with them into the indefinite future.< /review>

Professional, courteous staff. I brought my Discovery in for its first service. The service associate was able to schedule my service that day, if I didn't need a loaner car.  Received the car the next day as promised. My one issue is, the car was not washed. Was this because it was not a scheduled appointment? I believe for an $800.00 service the car should be cleaned.< /text>

The service department at Land Rover Rancho Mirage is excellent.  I normally go to the San Diego Land Rover service department.  From now on, I will try to have all my service in Rancho Mirage because my experience with them was so good.  They care about the customer, figured out a way to get me in because my window was smashed (by a thief) so my car not secure.  They replaced the window quickly and checked factory updates.  It was truly the best experience I have had at a Land Rover dealership.<//text>

Range Rover in Rancho Mirage has the best service department.  They were quick and I had one of the nicest service guys, Chad.  He takes care of all your needs.  Always trying to be your time short and keep your cost down.< /Review>

We continued shopping for a couple more days and Chase called us back to see if we would still be interested. We said yes, he found us something even nicer with more options then we thought we could have. Never liked the experience of car shopping in the desert. But at European Motors in Rancho Mirage. They are exceptional. Thanks to Chase</text>< resp>

We love the team at Jaguar Land Rover Rancho Mirage.    The service advisors are super helpful and keep us informed and up date on the process.  The loaner car was fun to drive and made the whole thing easy to work into our schedules.< /review>

Today has been an amazing day!  We had the opportunity to work with Gabriel Munoz who was a sincere pleasure to work with.  He was extremely knowledgeable regarding the vehicles that were looking at and he made our final decision an easy one to make.  He was professional, down to earth, and we connected with him quickly.  I highly recommend Gabriel and Land Rover Rancho Mirage for your next vehicle purchase.</review>

<text>We were in the middle of a road trip pulling our travel trailer and only 20 minutes out from our next location in the Mojave desert when we experienced some issues.  We had to turn around and find the closest dealer which was Rancho Mirage.  It was 4:00pm on a Friday when we arrived and I can't express how grateful we were for Casey Diggins the Lead Technician who took the time to diagnose the issue.  Thank you Casey and thank you Chad Ingram for making him available and getting us back on the road to continue our trip.  What a great team!!!!  To experience such outstanding customer service makes us thankful to be Land Rover owners!!!!<//text><userid>113421359059552957958<//userid><Pics>None< /Pics><Rating>5</Rating></record>

Excellent service from the get go. Andre was on top of my problem and was super patient and considerate from the moment I walked in. While my Range Rover was being fixed he supplied an Uber for me to go and do my food shopping and on top of that because the mechanic had encountered a problem and there would be a delay he provided me with a beautiful new Discovery as a loaner. Incredible five star service if you are a Land Rover owner you’d be mad not to use this service.</review>

Have been in the market for a new car.  Have visited several other dealerships with less than stellar results.  So with much hesitation, I went to the Jaguar dealership at Desert European Motorcars.....what an amazingly pleasant experience.  I talked with the salesperson, Gabe, on the phone, made an appointment to come in, and from the greeting to the goodbye, I couldn’t have asked for a more pleasant experience.  Gabe is extremely knowledgeable about EVERY car on the lot.  Extremely personable helpful.  Not pushy.  Gives you the facts and your options and let’s you decide.
Pretty seamless from start to finish.  Highly recommend this dealership as well as our salesperson, Gabe.<//text>

< Review>
First class experience. I bought the vehicle sight unseen. Greg in sales took the time to go out and do a walk around to inspect for any damage. Greg made the buying process fast and hassle free. When the vehicle arrived, which Greg also handled, it was everything that he had represented it to be. Great follow up. I actually paid a little more for this vehicle than a few others I was looking at but as the saying goes “best price isn’t always best deal”.
Wouldn’t hesitate to buy another vehicle or recommend friends to this company.<//Review>

I took my car in because a warning light was on and there was a rattling sound in the ceiling lighting area. Service was good until after I picked up my car. On the way home a different caution light (the all terrain light) came on. I called and left a message and was called back quite quickly.  I was told they’d check with the lead tech to see if there was a way to clear the warning light without bringing it in back into the service center. I did not receive a call back. I called again today and left a message again and still did not hear back.
UPDATE: I received a call this morning. They apologized for not calling back and explained they would need to look at my car to figure what is wrong with. They said to bring it in any time. I am changing my rating based on receiving the call back.< /Review>

I had an amazing experience at this dealership and am thrilled with my purchase of my new Range Rover Sport SC. I worked with Jacob who was excellent, especially with my circumstances. I was moving from Boston to San Diego and so I had to do the deal unseen. Jacob sent me pics, videos, and took care of the entire lease process so when I got there all I had to do was sign. Then he showed me all the features and set me up with a few of the Apps. Will go back again.< /Text>

I could have sworn the days of allowing a customer to try before you buy was extinct.  Well that’s exactly what the gentlemen at Indigo did and it made the buying experience exceptional! Mike Weibel is the consummate pro and worked his butt off to make the deal work. I’ll continue to use Indigo for all my high end auto purchases.< /text>

Had a great experience buying my car. Jacob was a pleasant to deal with. They were able to price match a price I got from out of town. I was happy to keep my business local.</text>

Wonderful dealership, the best experience that I have ever had at a dealership. The staff is extremely professional and friendly, no pushy salesmen trying to sale you a car that you don’t want. Thank you Landrover of Rancho Mirage my family and I will definitely come back for future purchases.<//Text>

Great pricing.  Chayse was awesome to work with to get me a great deal on new Ipace.  They had the color combo I wanted so bought from Rancho Mirage even though I live in San Diego.  Delivered the car to me and signed papers etc in my own home.  Couldn’t have been better experience unless they gave me the car for 1/2 off or free

Just wanted to give a shout out to Chad my service advisor, I had a few issues on my Range Rover and with his professional assistance he took care of my car and the service items turned out great! I was mostly impressed with his daily follow-up keeping me informed with the progress of repairs. Thanks again to Chad!</review>

Although I am a first time customer, my experience has been excellent to date. Customer service has been friendly and helpful. Service has been timely and thorough and they pointed out an obvious issue that another mechanic never did. I love my Jaguar and I want her to have the best. I will be going back to Jaguar Land Rover Ranch Mirage. Thank You Mark.</text>

<review>I'd been on the search for a Pre-owned RR Sport for quite some time.  I was very particular and specific on what I wanted.   I found one at Land Rover Rancho Mirage and worked with Cody over the phone and online but unfortunately the deal was lost.  I shared my disappointment with Cody and the team.  At that point, I received a correspondence from Mike Weible who worked very hard to earn my business.   In the end they found me the perfect car and made the process quick, smooth and professional.   I was able to finish what I started with Cody and Land Rover Rancho Mirage has another 5 star rating.</review></record></dataset><record>

From the service drive attendants, to my service advisor Chad, to the loaner car attendant to the salesperson, each and everyone was courteous, honest, kind and helpful.

Dealing with a car sales persons is always irritated.
Many of them toss broken numbers to lure their another victims.
However, Jacob was different.
He did not make any  broken promises.
He just gave me numbers that he could make and it was the best deal I had got.
Processing was smooth and he was polite and professional.
It was worth enough to drive long to have a car.

<Review>Mark Belmonte is a great service advisor and lucky to have him help me.  I have owned 5 Range Rovers and lived in big cities where service would seem hectic---but ---all of these dealerships were quick with the simple services.  One day in and out in the afternoon ---or in some cases even wait for 2 hours.  I am obviously a repeat customer for Land Rover. Your dealership is too slow--2 1/2 days for fluid changes and a new battery on a car with 7,000 miles.---hard on the customer with busy schedule.</Review><UserId.>113440462140185916712< /UserId.><time>1535674284287</time></record></dataset><record>

< review>
This dealership does not follow orders very well, I took my RR Velar for a for a Routine Oil Change and told the Maintenance manager that the car needed Coolant. They did what they call an Annual Service which I never asked for and as my wife picked up the vehicle and she was charged accordingly. So basically I was almost double charged for a standard oil change and they didn’t even add any coolant which is what I specifically asked for. Just seems to me like they are more interested in doing/charging you for certain things than doing what the customer is asking for. Terrible experience from these guys, I probably will never be back unless they figure out a way to make this right.</review>

Let me start off by saying that I never write reviews, so this in itself means something. I was on my way from LA to AZ and noticed a whining noise from the rear end. I stopped by to see when they could check it out, and they were booked until tomorrow. I told Andre that I didn’t live in the area and wasn’t able to wait a day. They stopped what they were doing, and brought my car in the shop to do a full inspection. Casey went over everything on the car with me and spent a lot of time explaining things, taking a lot of time to be thorough. I have never had such a great experience like this at any shop, let alone dealer, in my entire life. A+ service, wish I lived in the area!</text>

The salesman Chayse was very professional and we were able to pick the car up on the same day we test drove. I am disappointed that a vehicle like Land Rover does not have standard equipment like keyless entry like lower-end cars. I definitely would have chosen a different model if I had realized that.  It does not even allow you to lock your doors from the inside while exiting. This is poor design.

Another complaint that has not yet been corrected is that the temperature and time revert back to Celsius and military as soon as you turn it off.   You reset and it will not stay. That applies to choosing ECO driving style instead of AUTO as well where you might get better mileage around town.

Yesterday, I started the vehicle and drove a distance and none of the console displays came on for Navigation, Media, Phone. First it only said “Land Rover” then went black altogether.  I feel there are some bugs to work out.

Another oddity is when you stop the car and put it in park.  I was waiting in line at the bank and it needed to be restarted.  Sometimes, I have to restart the car when I’ve ended a trip to get it to turn off. Confusing.

It does appear to be a solidly built vehicle with lots of safety features.

I was very un-thriller with their storage and cleaning accessory package that cost about $1000. Seemed like a waste if money.

I have not decided if I want another Land Rover when my lease is up.</Text>

We had a great experience leasing a beautiful new Range Rover from Jaguar Land Rover Rancho Mirage! They gave us a very fair trade-in value for our previous Rover and treated us like royalty. Their service department is just as helpful and is by far the best experience we've  ever had with dealership service departments.  We would highly recommend them if you're in the market for a fine Jaguar or Land Rover vehicle!<//Text>

<Text>Professional, responsive, and attentive to our needs ... Eric Brooks and the Team at Jaguar Land Rover Rancho Mirage did a wonderful job of answering all of our questions - and getting us into a wonderful new vehicle!

Update: Just getting around to this review - but had a wonderful experience with the service department - with what started as an unfortunate experience. Michael Labrecque, Service Manager, went above and beyond - stepped up, did the right thing, & made sure that me and my family were satisfied. Ultimately turning what could have been a bad experience into a very positive one!< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><time>1534623348179< /time><user>108074105706473871598</user>< response>

My girlfriend and I were camping outside of Palm Springs with our 2006 Range Rover. We woke up in the morning to find the Rover sitting lower than it should be, started the car and found suspension fault on the display. After some obligatory cursing I called Rancho Mirage and they luckily were able to get us in. When we arrived Chad Ingram checked us in, he was awesome, very personable, and professional. Chad was able to find us a loaner car so we didn't have to interrupt our plans for the day. A few hours later we recieved a text from Chad with a diagnosis and estimate of the repair cost. They had the part in stock and could have it done that same day and at a very fair price.  I ok'd the repair and we picked it up later that day. For a nerve racking situation, Chad, Service Manager Michael Labrecque, and the skilled Technician made the whole experience very pleasant. I would definitely recommend the Service Department and would like to thank them again for such an outstanding experience.<//text>

<review>Service exceeds my expectations.   The service advisor is very professional and helpful.  The work is done correctly, and on time.  The prices are reasonable.   They provide a nice loaner while my Rover's in their shop.  For all these reasons, I choose to have annual service done here rather than at home.</review>< pictures>

<Review>I called 3 times before going on a road trip stating that there was something wrong with my car. ( it only had 7,000 miles at the time) It was hesitating upon acceleration. Each time I was told there absolutely nothing wrong and that that was normal when a car was shifting gears. ( this is my 2 nd Discovery and I knew the vehicle well) After my trip and being assured by passengers that the hesitation was not normal I took the vehicle back in and insisted they take a look at it. I was told when they hooked it up there were several error codes. It was in service for a week as they tried to determined the cause. It was very frustrating that I was not taken seriously from the beginning.<//Review>< GmapID>

<Review>Service was AWFUL!!! Mark, the Land Rover Service Rep was terrible, as usual. I didn't know he would be my service person before I dropped off my car. If had known, I would have requested someone else . I reserved a loaner in advance. There were no loaners available. I was dropped off at Enterprise to pick up a rental for the day. When I went in to Enterprise, there were no rentals available for at least an hour. I called the dealership back and was put on hold twice. Finally spoke to Michael who came to pick me up and took me back to the dealership. I picked up my car and went back to work without work being performed. Two hours wasted!</Review>< Pictures>

I have  a 1996 Land Rover Discovery; yep, twenty years old and entering "the  company don't make the parts any more" stage. This dealer has serviced my car several times over the years. I appreciate the service they provide and trust them implicitly. They have always treated me well, listen to my concerns about my vehicle and follow up with me.  I love my Land Rover and hope to keep driving it as long as possible.</text>

<text>I had the best experience with Chayse  add Jaguar of Rancho Mirage. He called me on his day off, Sunday,  and said he would get back to me the next business morning which she did. We did the deal later that evening and my car was delivered to me in West Hollywood the next day.  It was an absolute pleasure doing business with Jaguar of Rancho Mirage. Very quick and painless. I highly recommend this dealership and Chayse is your man. This is my first Jag and I absolutely love it!!!!!<//text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Mark and Jackie in Jaguar Service are fantastic. They responded to my inquiries, ordered the part I needed to replace on my FX, loaned me the new F-Pace SUV to drive for four days and got me in and out at checkout time. A great experience at Jaguar Desert Motors!!<//Text>

I have  a 1996 Land Rover Discovery; yep, twenty years old and entering "the  company don't make the parts any more" stage. This dealer has serviced my car several times over the years. I appreciate the service they provide and trust them implicitly. They have always treated me well, listen to my concerns about my vehicle and follow up with me.  I love my Land Rover and hope to keep driving it as long as possible.<//text>

Very pleased with our sales person but we were told someone from Range rover would call us and come to our house to go over the details of all the features of the car and connect the remoteless entry for the garage & gate; however we were never contacted by this person so we are still trying to figure things out for ourselves.</review>

I’m a devout Rover enthusiast and having just driven my vehicle across country.... who knew what they would find !  Took it in for an oil change and safety check - the service department was not only courteous and professional, they were honest and fair !

I would gladly recommend this location to any friends or family for Rover service. I’ll definitely bring my vehicle back to this location when the it’s time.<//Text>< Pictures>

He explained everything to me and followed through with it all. I  had my car back by the end of the day.  And they even brought me a cup of coffee as soon as I arrived!

Receptionist just sends an email.   No communication or updates until  oops its done.     Car came back filthy with dust and water spots all over it.      Time to switch back to chevrolet</text>< Pictures>

Mark was fantastic!  My information screen went blank while I was in Rancho Mirage.  I was driving to Cabo Mexico on Friday and couldn’t be without the screen.  Mark took my car, gave me a loaner and estimated 1-2 days but I’d be on the road on Friday.  Next day Mark called to let me know they updated the screen and the car was ready.  Mark is fantastic in the way he handled the issue but I also know there are people behind him in the shop that also make things happen.  Compliments and “thank you” to everyone in Service, especially Mark.  Thanks!<//review>

<Review>Right now is a bad time to survey me as my brand new 2017 Disvovery has been sitting in my garage for a month as I drive a rental.  JLR has refused a buy back and I cannot get anyone at the dealership to contact me about a trade in.  I am so disappointed in how this has gone down and feel like dealership and company could care less about me...I’ve heard reassuring words but no actions😕.  I would really appreciate hearing from someone about a trade in within the next couple of days.</Review>< Pics>

<rate>5</rate><text>My wife and I had to have our LR2 serviced while on vacation here from Colorado. The Land Rover service team at Rancho Mirage took us in immediately and worked on our car that afternoon after dropping us off at the nearby mall. They notified us that our air cleaner also needed replacing while we shopped. They picked us back up and gave us back a cleaned, serviced and "happy" vehicle. They explained exactly what they found during the servicing inspection, and did the job for a very reasonable amount of money. We really appreciate what Greg Jittlov and his staff did for us on such short notice, and wouldn't hesitate to use them again if we needed help again next year.

Way to long to get a car serviced.
Way to long wait to get a appointment to service my car.
If, you had a real problem little or none help.
They need to expand the service dept.
Looks like a very big profit area of the business.< /review>

I appreciated the expertise demonstrated by the service manager,Chad Ingram, and the quality of work done on our Range Rover Sport.
Room for improvement: More mechanics so the wait time for work to be done is minimized.<//text>

Very disappointed with my experience this time around. I’ve had both my Jaguar and Landrover serviced there for several years. Granted, my Landrover is older, but that shouldn’t justify the dismissive reception I received, nor the lackluster service that followed. I couldn’t even get anyone to arrange a shuttle back to the dealership, despite numerous requests and phone messages which were never returned.< /Text>

Brought my Range Rover Sport Supercharged in for it's one year service. Dropped off on a Wednesday at 7:30 a.m., and was told that I may have the car back the same day, but for sure would have it back Thursday. When I hadn't received any update from my service adviser Mark Belmonte, I called the dealership. The receptionist could not get anyone in service to answer, and assured me I'd get a call back briefly.... never did. Now Friday morning and no answer at the dealership at 8:11, and nobody answering in the service department which opens at 7:30 a.m.
My service advisers "direct number" was never answered at anytime. Additionally, I was provided a 2018 Jaguar as a loaner with ZERO gas in it... I mean not even showing on the gas gauge!! Is anyone at this dealership paying attention to detail - I'd suggest no.< /Text>

< Review>
What a great experience! We have purchased many cars over the past 30 years and this ranks as one of the top. I pulled into the lot with the intention of sitting in a JaguarPace to see if it was more comfortable than our Caddie. Eric Brooks said sure...sit in this one! It was SO comfortable and I am tall and it was easy to get in and I had so much legroom! Bill had wanted a Jag as he has had so many different cars over the years and he really liked the looks of the Pace F. He gave Eric the go ahead and we came in the next day and bought it! Eric was so professional and friendly and made it a nice experience. We then went into Bill B's office..did the paperwork which was also cut and dry and didn't take HOURS! We took a drive around the block where we learned more about how to work all the buttons than we ever knew in the caddie! We LOVE the vehicle and Eric already arranged for us to drop it off to get the coating and a thorough detail.!! We are very pleased with such a great car buying experience!!!< /Review>

<text>I have bought 2 vehicles from this Jaguar/Land Rover Desert auto group in the past calendar year so I have the street cred to throw down the truth about this fantastic group of workers at the dealership!!!
Eric Brooks is the man, the myth and the legend!
This guy is the academy award winner for people skills!!! He'd get the OSCAR!!!
Eric was stellar in his execution at explaining the newer features and kept me smiling the entire way through the process.
We could not believe how painless this experience was yet again!!!
Every time you walk in any car dealership they "pounce and attack" but not at JLR, it is always a welcoming feeling. (something rare in this industry these days in my opinion)
What is necessary in this review is this:
It helps when you have a smiling, enthusiastic salesman that keeps you educated during the entire time with out being pushy! (look for Eric!!)< /text>< resp>

Sub par expience thus far. Took my Supercharged Range Rover there for routin service on an appointment with 10 day lead time. They were not ready at time of appointment. More expensive then Land Rover of NEWPORT Beach but on top of that took a week. I was contactly coaching advisor on communication and on top of that my door panel is disconnected,  service lite has not been reset and by brake pad light sensor went off within a 100 miles since pick up! So much for 62-point inspection. Did my car even get serviced who know. If they are not doing that simple task correctly what else are they not doing. I’ve emailed my service adviser over 4 days ago and still have not heard back. I would appreciate a call for the manager so I can amend this review. Given that they are only local dealer I most likely won’t buy from this auto group as left unanswered. Ogera Coach delivers everywhere anyways and most landlover dealer don’t care where you live anymore.</text>

I took my Range Rover to fix a pillar outside, on top of getting my car serviced. They called me to pick the car up, and an hour later notified me that my car was scratched. Waited another week for my car to be done getting the scratch fixed, to only find out the pillar wasn’t fixed while already on my way home..< /review>

Excellent!
Fast, easy, in and out!

(2 wks of dealing with salesjerks in land rover mission viejo, newport beach, ventura & cerritos. They were all talk with their famous quotes "we have the car offsite" "we can get you the car" "the other dealer won't trade" -then after they promise you the car, all of a sudden - "the car got sold" 😠 a**h****. Not to mention, they all dinged my decent credit by 10 points) ~vent over.

Back to land rover rancho mirage 😇 which we found thru TrueCar :). Received an email & a call from Tony, they had the exact car I wanted! A few back/forth business texts & a couple quick business calls, within 24 hrs he was congratulating me over the fone! Just like that! No haggling, no BS-ing, no LIES, no condescending macho attitudes & none of that pretentiousness you'll typically get here in newport beach! For Pete's sake, I only wanted a basic disco SE, all other salesmen couldn't perform like the cars they're selling!
Tony & Davin in finance however were very professional & did their jobs well done! 👍👌The 4hr roundtrip for me seemed the longest in this whole process but definitely worth it!
Hopefully both of them will still be there🙏 bc I already know where I'm going back for my next car in 3 yrs!

Land rover rancho mirage thank you. Davin in finance thank you. Tony in sales thank you so much!

☺
Angeline

P.S.
Of all LR locations I've been to (including ATL where I first got my 98 discovery in 98), yours by far is the most well designed & the cleanest👌 not to mention, the employees were also professionally well dressed! Being an interior designer in the 90s & clothing industry in the 80s, to this day I notice design, architecture, & how professionals dress! I think it counts!</text>

I love buying cars from indigo auto group in rancho mirage. Specifically, Jag/Range Rover. The staff there is just amazing. Louie is my favorite salesman ever. He is very calm and not aggressive which helps you enjoy your car shopping experience. I bought an evoque from him. Later, while on vacation we decided to get a sports car and Mike Melikian the sales manager at Range Rover found us a Mclaren. It wasn't even his dealership and he helped us get a good deal. It was effortless. Then I decided I wanted a Range Rover sport (evoque was too small for me) and Melikian helped me get out of my evoque and into my new Range Rover sport svr. They then found another srv for my friend in Kentucky. They really made the experience enjoyable. Love these guys. Will only purchase my cars through them.</Review>

Pinnacle of what Luxury Dealerships should be. We traveled 150 miles to purchase our vehicle from Desert European. GM Yohan Haddad made sure our experience was flawless and his staff made our buying experience one of the best we've experienced.

Our in and out process was super fast, no gimmicks no pushy sales tactics. I can't see myself buying a vehicle from anywhere else. Thank you Yohan Haddad and Associates.< /review>

The engine light on my LR4 suddenly appeared while visiting our home in PS. I had to drive my Family back to LA that evening and was concerned I would encounter issues. Although the service Dept. was closed on Saturday, I was helped by one of their staff, Joshua, who promptly offered assistance and inspected my vehicle. He then directed me to Jacob Dutton who ran a diagnostic and identified the issue. He explained his findings and then assured me that the vehicle was safe to drive that evening. I was advised to follow up with my local LR service dept to reconcile the problem.
I am grateful to these 2 gentleman for their help today. I had essentially come off the street with an older model Land Rover on a Saturday afternoon in 100 degree weather, yet we were not turned away.
Here is an example of OUTSTANDING customer service which I received at Land Rover Rancho Mirage.</Review>
