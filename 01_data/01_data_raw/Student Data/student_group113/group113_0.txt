<rate>5< /rate><Text>I used Duran's to send a very important flower arrangement.  I wanted something that was not one of their standard arrangements.  Lulu the flower artist was absolutely wonderful.  Between emails and phone conversations she was able to create an incredibly beautiful arrangement with two dozen multi-colored roses.  It was breath-taking.  She even sent me a photo before it was sent out, and made sure that the card was just right.  I highly recommend Duran's for your flower needs.< /Text>< Pictures>

Beautiful floral arrangement. Duran's website was easy to use. Their service was fast and efficient. I ordered in the morning and the flowers were delivered in the early afternoon of the same day. A plus is that they are a local business.<//Review>

He was aggravated because he had difficulties understanding me thru my mask and screamed 'what' unnecessarily loud twice cutting me off mid sentence.

The quality of the flowers has really started to degrade. I understand the Valentine’s Day markup. Paying $60 for the dozen that I normally get for less than $20 is ridiculous. Especially when that $60 gets you a dozen that isn’t very fresh nor very good looking. On top of that, the employees aren’t very polite. Shop somewhere else and give your money to a better flower shop.< /Review>< Response>

I  live in California and was looking online for a local florist for my mother. I ordered two arrangements or her. Just because.  She called when she received them and read both cards. She commented how beautiful the flowers were and she couldn’t be happier. Everything was exactly as ordered. Great on -line process. A great florist for the Terre Haute, IN area.<//Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>I am so happy I called this flower shop for my need. I needed to send flowers to a memorial service in Pasadena.  Because I live in Georgia I needed someone I could trust to meet my expectations and send flowers that represent me well. Alfredo (Antonio) did a wonderful job with the choice of flowers and the beautiful vase he had picked despite of all the Valentine's busyness. I received several compliments for the flowers and the vase. I am so pleased with him and his work and would not hesitate to use them in the future. 2016<//Text>< name>

I couldn’t find a sympathy bouquet online so I decided to call. The lady was beyond rude and very unclear, and when I asked to clarify she had an attitude. I paid $77 for the TINIEST arrangement with sloppy writing and my name spelt incorrectly with no desire to ask. Save your money and order from 1-800-flowers.

I found this shop back in 1997 when they had a special for 100 Roses at $40. I have been coming here to this day. At times even going way out of my way for awesome roses, service, and prices. I live in South Fontana but Duran's has always given me the best of everything. Every chance I get I recommend Duran's Flowers. Thanks for the 15 years of great service!

<rate>1< /rate><Review>Never again. Ordered via the website and was charged 100 bucks twice. Flowers never delivered.

I called them several times trying to get a status on the order and was told only that "all the orders are on the trucks for delivery." They couldn't tell me anything about my particular order. I called back at the end of the day and was finally told that while my order was received, it was never fulfilled and would I like flowers delivered on February 15th? No thanks. Quite possibly the worst florist on the planet. Not only will I never use them again, I will never order flowers from any florist, period.  It's all a giant overpriced scam.<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>They should be embarrassed about the insane prices they had listed on Valentine's day. Just disgraceful. Gouge much? I saw the look in everyone's eyes like, are you serious? Went to another shop for a fraction of the price, and they were very very nice, albeit still expensive but cheap compared to this ridiculousness. I'm sure your flowers are nice and well taken care of and likely more reasonably priced the rest of the year. I get a price hike around the holidays but you should honestly be embarrassed trying to charge that much. I wish I took pictures...< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

< Review>
Never again. Ordered via the website and was charged 100 bucks twice. Flowers never delivered.

I called them several times trying to get a status on the order and was told only that "all the orders are on the trucks for delivery." They couldn't tell me anything about my particular order. I called back at the end of the day and was finally told that while my order was received, it was never fulfilled and would I like flowers delivered on February 15th? No thanks. Quite possibly the worst florist on the planet. Not only will I never use them again, I will never order flowers from any florist, period.  It's all a giant overpriced scam.<//Review>

They were compassionate and just all around amazing with my family. We list my father in law suddenly and the owner helped us personally and even put a smile on his mother's face.< /Text>

My fiancé surprised me with an incredible birthday gift - the gift of flight and being exposed to something I’ve been dreaming about since I was young. As soon as we walked in Jonna greeted us and really made us feel at home. Harrison was my flight instructor and man is he fly! Super knowledgeable, fun and someone you really trust as soon as the wheels are up. Definitely sparked a fire in me and had such an amazing experience. Highly recommend!</Text>

< review>
I needed some time in an airplane that Santa Monica Flyers had in their fleet. They were professional in meeting my needs and communicated clearly when there were scheduling or weather issues.

All their staff is super friendly and knowledgeable. And they have a pretty sweet (and growing) fleet of airplanes.

I flew with Joseph, the general manager. I truly enjoyed flying with him and learning from him. Joseph and his staff take their jobs seriously but they make the experience fun. And flying should be fun! Either way, I highly recommend Santa Monica Flyers for those of you who may be in search of a flight school to conduct your primary or advanced training. They have a solid fleet and a lot of great instructors. They're not going to B.S. you like some of these other schools.

Regards,
An experienced instructor pilot< /review>

< Review>
I ferried a Cessna 210 to SMO yesterday and had a friend who never flown in an airplane before, wanted to give him a quick ride around to motivate his dreams. I needed a headset, went in this place to rent one for him for an hour. An Old Lady approached me in a very negative way with her words. She told me to go purchase one from a store. They had about 10 headsets hanging on the wall. She refused to rent me one. Usually, aviation community are very friendly and helpful one to another one but not this place. I could not find a headset to rent or borrow around. Shame on that old lady. I am a CFI and a Ferry pilot. I have crossed the Country many times and never experienced such situation with an FBO or School. Her looks at me was definitely saying a lot of words more than " no they cant rent you one, you should purchase one". Hope you change your attitude towards pilots in this tight Aviation community. One positive attitude goes a long way.</Review>
<resp>{'time': 1612337956853, 'text': 'Hi Jack, I’m really disappointed to hear about your experience at our school.  If you flew regularly with us you’d know that doesn’t exemplify us at all.  I did some digging and found out you spoke with one of our CFIs, who doesn’t work our customer service desk and didn’t realize we, in fact, do rent out our headsets to pilots and their passengers. I was also surprised to hear of the negative attitude you experienced as she is one of the most enthusiastic and up beat people we have!  While I realize you may never have the chance to occasion KSMO again, I’d love the opportunity to make it right.  Please reach out to me personally if you get a chance, Joseph Vazquez Miller, GM.  Thank you so much for sharing your experience with us.'}< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2bafdf5567757:0xf69ada9e1cfde598</Gmap_id><userid>112364576169210645811< /userid>< rate>

<review>This school has been a dream of mine to attend to ever since I’ve dreamt of flying!!! I recently started and have accumulated just under 3 flight hours with Austin. He is a great instructor and really helps you understand the world of flying. He answers all your questions and overall is a fun person to be with and trustful when it comes to flying the PiperSport. The office itself is very organized and clean and the staff is taking great precautions in staying safe during these hard times. Booking flights is as easy as booking a movie ticket and the lessons are truly enjoyable. I love this school so much and I can’t wait to get my private pilot license!!!<//review></record></dataset><record>

Earned my sport license at SMF with flight instructor Sam. She was absolutely fantastic to fly with. I was more than prepared for exams (scored 95% humble brag) and the school has well maintained planes, great location and friendly staff.  Their fleet of LSAs are easy to book with solid availability. Highly recommend SMF to any aspiring student or renter!<//text>

My 15-year old SAMO High School son wants to be a commercial pilot someday and I am very happy I found this school for him.  I am very satisfied with the lower rates here compared to the other SM Airport schools we tried first. The 10-hour (paid in advance) Sport Cruiser aircraft package has made this very affordable for me cutting the total cost by about 35% of other schools.  I experienced some over billing at another SM Flight school as well, so beware.  My son says SM Flyers is a great fit for him. He likes the younger, kind staff (yet very professional) and the ping-pong table in the lobby.  He also likes this funny chemtrail picture.< /Text>

Santa Monica Flyers is a great place to go to for your flight training, refreshers or as renter. I already have my PPL and did my biannual flight review @ SMF. I also rented their G1000 C172 on a couple of days.
Overall: Very well organized, planes in great condition, super friendly staff and great atmosphere (incl. nice facilities). Definitely will come back!<//Text>

<Text>I'd give 6 stars if I could. This is the definition of how a flight school should be operated. Amazingly friendly, courteous, knowledgeable, and helpful staff and instructors. Joseph is always happy to help, extremely friendly, and keeps the place running smoothly and efficiently. The inside is always clean, organized, and there are snacks and refreshments at all times. My instructor AJ has been incredible. He's always happy to help, extremely knowledgeable, and has just the right attitude and approach to flying that you would want from an instructor. The administrative staff is always helpful and very friendly. The scheduling system is always available and accessible, easily accessed online from your phone from anywhere. Their policies are sensible and logical. The planes are maintained in exemplary condition, and the maintenance team always makes sure that planes are topped up with gas and ready to go. I could not speak more highly of this flight school. Keep up the excellent work !!!< /Text>< pics>

I hate giving this place 2 stars because it might be a good school but unfortunately I was told one thing and when I showed up they were unable to meet the request.  I had 3 separate conversations and was assured each time the request would be ok.  I paid them and then showed up only to be told they could not fulfill the request.  I would have found another school had they just been forthright with me.  Sad....</review>

<review>Wow! Having gone to many other flights school in California, I️ have yet to find a more experienced, diligent, and top of the league school as Santa Monica Flyers! They truly represent a worldwide passion for flying and teaching. From day one they were extremely accommodating and kind, they were able to work around my schedule and budget, and partnered me with the right instructor that met my needs. If you are serious about getting your wings and putting in the time, there isn’t a place in LA that has the fleet, instructors and overall experience that the team have created here. I’m proud to say that as a woman, I️ truly feel at home and I️ cannot wait to share my love of flying with my friends and family. Thank you Santa Monica Flyers for making my dream come true!< /review></record>

I have been leaning flying since Apr with Santa Monica Flyers. The planes here are great, new, safe and clean. The best part is the instructors. I worked with 2 of them - AJ and Chris, and they are both patient and experienced excellent instructors. I am getting my sport pilot soon. At first I just wanted to pursuit a sport license, but the fast progress and great instructors made me decide to continue for a private license.</Text>

I've had a fantastic experience at Santa Monica Flyers. I began with an intro flight in January and now I'm 20 hours into my instruction and wake up excited everyday I am scheduled to fly. All the guys here are professional and knowledgeable and the airplanes are late model and very well maintained. My instructor, AJ, spends time ensuring I'm understanding concepts and adapts his teaching style to my learning style. If you're at all interested in flying sign up for an intro flight!<//Text>

Did my intro flight at SMO and was hooked. Have about 14 hours logged now and can’t be happier with both the staff and CFI’s. The weather can sometimes be an issue but that’s anywhere. Sam, my CFI is very knowledgeable and always available to answer any questions.

If your thinking about getting your private license you can do it all in a sports cruiser to save some money. Than transition into a  Cessna to get your instrument :)

Also if your thinking of becoming a commercial pilot Joseph the manager is very knowledgeable and loves to help.< /review>

Friendly at first, than you start to see the problems.

Here is what I found to be problematic.

1. Their rates seem low because they can offer the sport pilot program. If you look at becoming a private pilot their rates are very high. (ill explain why this is a problem)

2. Being a sport pilot ensures that you can only operate planes in that class, therefore you can only rent planes from santa monica flyers instead of flying Cessnas or Pipers which are everywhere.

3. These planes were down for maintenance all the time. Im not sure if it was because parts for these rare planes are hard to come by or because they need to be taken off the line often. For example they advertise having 5 planes available for a week I was training they were down to 1.

4. Santa Monica has frequently has a marine layer which goes right to the airport and inhibits you from flying VFR which  drags out the training.

(its hard to be proficient if you don't get to fly often because of maintenance and weather.)

5. If you want to fly at night, fly planes that are faster than your car, or continue your training as a pilot the sport pilot certificate is useless. Getting a private pilot certificate here is more expensive than all the other places I looked at.

All in all I wasted a lot of money here and ended up going to Van Nuys to complete my training.<//text>

{'time': 1536450616646, 'text': 'Josh, thank you for making some really important points about our flight school and flight training in general!\n\n1.       Our rates are, in fact, very competitive.  We have some of the lowest hourly rates on both our aircraft ($140/hr.) and our flight instructors ($75/hr.) in all of Southern California.  You can easily compare these rates by checking out flight school websites in the area.  What’s great is these Sportcruiser rates apply to both our Sport Pilot and Private Pilot training.  In fact, we offer a block rate, which lowers the aircraft rate to only $130 per hour!\n\n2.       Sport Pilots can fly any “Light Sport Aircraft” in the United States.  There are a number of places you can rent LSAs in Southern California, including Santa Monica, Torrance, Van Nuys, Camarillo and the Inland Empire.  Light Sport Aircraft were first certificated by the FAA in 2004 as a way of lowering the barriers to flying for those who didn’t want to spend as much time and money needed to obtain the Private Pilot Certificate.  An additional advantage to flying Light Sport Aircraft is, not only can they fly as high as any other light, single piston airplane and almost as fast (120 mph as the crow flies), but they also burn half as much fuel, cutting the carbon footprint of your flight in half.  You can easily get to Santa Barbara, San Diego or Riverside from Santa Monica in as little as 45 minutes, have dinner and be back before Sunset!\n\n3.       Santa Monica Flyers has a solid reputation for extremely safe aircraft operations and training.  We immediately ground our aircraft if even something very small isn’t working right.  This is one area that distinguishes us from many flight schools in the area.  Some schools are known for flying airplanes that aren’t working perfectly but we pride ourselves on never taking chances with the lives of our students and renters.  You’re right, maintenance, and weather can get in the way of flight training – and often does – regardless of which flight school you train at.  The question is, what kinds of decisions does your flight school make about maintenance on the aircraft you train in?\n\n4.       Fortunately the marine layer in Santa Monica is not too frequent and is most prevalent in May and June.  It is also why we encourage our students to keep at least a few lessons on the books so that if one flight gets cancelled, we can work on ground school topics that day, to reserve the flying for the next lesson.  Our instructors are eager and incentivized to keep flight training moving so that our students continue to move towards achieving their certificate as quickly as possible.\n\n5.       The Sport Pilot Certificate is an excellent choice for hundreds of our students want to “get their feet wet” in aviation at a much lower cost than getting a Private Pilot Certificate.  At 120 mph over the ground, the aircraft are very quick, highly responsive and really fun to fly.  It’s why so many pilots return to us, after getting their certificate, to rent airplanes for their personal use!'}<//Response>

<date>1423713756141<//date><rate>5< /rate><review>I learned to fly at Santa Monica Flyers and have been renting their airplanes for my personal use since I got my license. They fly out of Santa Monica Airport, one of the nicest airports in the country. Their modern Sportcruiser airplanes are roomy and the view is fantastic. They are located in a large office with an attached hangar. Charlie, the owner and a CFI, along with his staff of flight instructors, makes this THE place to learn to fly for reasonable money. I started by getting my Sport Pilot license, and since they teach for Private license too I will soon start pursuing that. Charley has been my flight instructor and you will not find a nicer person anywhere. He along with the other flight instructors will make sure you become a capable pilot without breaking the bank. Highly recommended!!<//review>< Pics>

It was my 4 year olds 1st time at the dentist and my daughter's first time at that office and let me tell you they where hands down amazing. They listen and wrote down all of my concerns. They where so patient with my little one and throughout the cleaning process make sure to tell the kids how wonderful they there doing. The doctor was very detailed in telling me steps that needed to be taken. She took her time and examined my kids teeth thoroughly. The staff where all bubbly lol and just a job to talk to. Over all 5 stars 10/10. I would recommend them to everyone.<//Text>

<review>I can't say enough great things about this dentistry. They go above and beyond to make my now 3 year comfortable and safe. She has been a patient here since she was 6 weeks old for a tongue tie release. Dr. Hannanvash is wonderful at explaining everything that is happening with your little one. She is incredibly patient as well. The atmosphere is great for kids and there is ample parking at the office.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>It had been a while since my child (5yr) had last been seen by the dentist and I was terrified of being judged. However, as soon I walked in the door I felt welcome! My son is extremely shy but quickly warmed up with the friendly staff and amazing exam room. His favorite part was being able to watch Finding Nemo, on the ceiling while he got his teeth cleaned. His next appt. is in 6mos and he has already requested that I mark his calendar so he can count down the days!</Review>< pics>

<Review>We started going to Little Star a few months back when my daughter needed a lip & tongue tie revision. As a first time mom, I was extremely nervous but Dr. Hannanvash was absolutely amazing. Walked me through every step of the entire process. My daughter continues to be a patient with her office & with every visit, I’m just more satisfied with Hannanvash & her staff. They’re so kind, thorough, & I’m always in & out of their office with minimal wait time. I feel so comfortable bringing my daughter there. It’s truly an amazing office.< /Review>< Pictures>

Little Star is AMAZING! I’ve already recommended it to all my friends for both lip/tongue tie needs and cleanings/exams. The staff is great. The wait time was minimal.

My 4 month old needed a tip and tongue tie release. The dentist did and great consultation. She told me the procedure would take 5-6 minutes. From the time they left the room and came back, it was only 3.

My toddler had X-rays, an exam, and cleaning. The assist who did the X-rays was GREAT! My son did not cry once. She used a lot of kid friendly words and referred to characters from movies to keep him connected.</Review>

<Text>Nice facility, friendly staff, informative dentist. I took my daughter in on recommendation from my sons dentist for a lip tie. We discovered a tongue tie as well. Absolutely not what I wanted to find and I’m really bummed my daughter needs a correction but I honestly knew the recommendation before I headed there. I’m relieved that a confident dentist who knows what they’re doing and can easily explain the procedure to me is the one doing it. I definitely cried during my daughters appointment today because I dont think any parent wants their child to have to have a procedure. however, I’m happy to have been connected with this dentist and have full confidence my daughter is in competent and compassionate hands.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

My three-year-old kid loves going to see Dr Naj! She even insisted on drawing her a pic. Going to the dentist is a very positive experience for my kid, half because I have prepared her and we play dentist at home and half because the office is so cute and the team is wonderful. Everyone is so gentle and patient and know how to make the experience fun.  I’ve referred all my friends and family to the office, too.  Thank you Little Star!< /text>

<Text>We had an amazing tongue and lip tie release experience with Little Star Pediatric. They were so prompt with our appointment time, thorough with describing the pro and cons to doing the procedure, and the procedure only took about 5 minutes. Since we went during Covid procedures, they encouraged me to have my husband on the phone to hear the options since he couldn't come into the appointment. The follow up appointments take less than 15 minutes and the doctor is amazing about checking in on all aspects for the tie releases. Thank you guys so much, we will be back when our baby has teeth to clean!<//Text>< pictures>

We’ve been coming here since my youngest (who is now 3) had his posterior tie treated. I had no intention of staying for routine dental care, but after such a positive experience, I felt I’d be making a poor decision if I didn’t. It’s now been over 3 years, and every time we come in, I’m blown away by the kindness and warmth of everyone in the office! I love that my boys are EXCITED to see the dentist.<//text>

As first time parents I think we would have appreciated a bit more consultation and the appointments feeling a little less rushed. Due to Covid, both parents aren’t allowed in which is very unfortunate to have to make such big decisions over the phone.</review><time>1618278166672</time>< pics>

Dr Najmeh and the staff at Little star have been amazing over the past 1.5 years we have been seeing them. They are always kind and comforting to my children with sensory processing disorder and make sure to assuage any concerns I have. We’ve had lip/tongue tie revisions, fillings under sedation as well as routine dental exams and have been more than pleased with every interaction. Dr Najmeh does a wonderful job of balancing information and conversation with the parent/guardian while engaging and involving the child. We can’t recommend them enough!

The office staff has also been great! They return calls promptly, schedule us in quickly if there is a concern and go out of there way to provide all ingredients of any product they use on our severe allergy kiddo.< /Text>

<Text>Little Star is the place to go for tongue tie revisions! We have kaiser and they use scissors. We went to Little Star to get a second opinion and decided to move forward. Little Star uses a laser and their care is exceptional. The staff are warm, comforting in stressful situation,  and Dr Naj is amazing! The procedure is quick and the entire team communicates clearly and made me feel comforted in their expertise. If you have an infant with tongue tie issues, come here first!< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Great children's dentist. Check in was fast and easy (we were the 1st appointment of the day). All of the staff who we interacted with was very friendly. It was my son's 1st dental appointment and they were very sweet with him. The doctor was also very nice and informative. We will definitely be going back!<//review>

<Text>My kids actually look forward to seeing Dr Najmeh. I never would have expected any kid to like the dentist, much less kids with oral defensiveness and SPD. When I told my 5 year old about our appointment this week, he said “YESSSSS!!” Then, I overheard my 8 year old during share time in (virtual) school this morning, telling their class about what a great time they’d had at the dentist yesterday! I wish she could be my dentist, too.< /Text><Response>{'time': 1612808839432, 'text': 'Thanks so much for your kind words.

Love Dr. N ... she’s extremely sweet and helpful. So many kind staff members here. One star missing bc the policies are a bit strict for check in and cancellations, and a particular staff member at check in seems a bit up tight (trying not to be rudely specific), and that’s a little unpleasant. Anyway, overall an excellent pediatric dentist and a nice facility. Truly 4.5 stars.< /Text>

I first brought my son to Dr. Najmeh to evaluate his tongue tie as he had been having some breathing/airway issues. We were looking at putting him under GA for a procedure and I wanted to rule out the tongue tie before doing so.

Dr. Najmeh was so kind and knowledgeable. She took ample time to listen to our story and addressed all of my questions and concerns. In the end we were able to conclude that he didn’t need a frenectomy and I felt much more at ease about moving forward with our other recommended procedure.

After the first time we saw her I knew that she was the only dentist I would trust to handle my child’s regular dental care. Tanisha at the front desk is always so kind and very thorough in regards to my insurance coverage. The assistant’s who help in handling his dental care are so warm, patient, and caring. Dr. Najmeh’s knowledge, skill, caring and fun personality are the perfect combination for a children’s dentist. I recommend her to everyone that I can!</Text>

Very happy with Little Star. Great facility and very well and clean kept. Professional staff who know exactly what they are doing and make sure you know all the ins/outs.

I went in and was told he had 8 cavities and would need to be under anesthesia to have them taken care of.  The other option was to avoid the anesthesia and have it all done while awake - they did not recommend this option.  But anesthesia would cost $1,250 and was ineligible for any type of insurance including PPO.  So I asked if we could break the anesthesia-free procedures into fewer sessions in order to make it more bearable - they were unhappy with this. I've been asking for them to call me back about this possibility for months and haven't heard any response or reason as to why they can't.< /text><Resp>None<//Resp><user_id>110607929424948116120</user_id>< username>

Our son had a Lip and Tongue tie surgery at four months. Since our experience with all other support providers in his early months didn’t catch both, I sought out more answers as to why we were having such a hard time. Our laser treatment went quickly, professionally, and with compassion from the doctor and staff alike. From that day forward, my advice to first time moms is to go to THIS SPECIFIC dentist in the first week of life. The facilities are brightly decorated with Star and sky decor, done tastefully, has TVs in the ceiling for kids, and is incredibly CLEAN. I plan to return when we have our second baby for an opinion. She is one of the only doctors I have fully trusted in this first year of life. Educated, common sense, fair, truthful, and PASSIONATE about assisting babies with ties. Grateful for this office and what it did for our son.< /Text>

<text>Extremely rude and inconsiderate DDS. If you are driving in from out of town, I would recommend just finding a local dentist who will lovingly care for the needs of your little one. I drove up 2 hours to bring my NB in for a  lip-tie revision, only to be told I had to reschedule.

They stated adamantly that the “rules you read and agreed to state nobody could come with the patient other than one parent”. I had missed that unfortunately, and my 4 year old was with me as I had no one to leave him with. They refused to let him sit in reception and said he would be a liability.

They also charge their patients for PPE which should come out of the dentists’ pocket (especially if you are paying $1400 for a 5-10 minute procedure!).

Worse experience I have had with a dentist, and I have worked in this field for over 10 years...<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>
{'time': 1591296362657, 'text': "Unfortunately your review is inaccurate and plainly untrue. Firstly, you never met or talked with me (Dr. Najmeh). If you are truly in the dental field, you know that all offices are limiting visits to scheduled patients and a single parent at this time, due to COVID-19 recommendations, and safety precautions that go in line with that. You were given those recommendations prior to scheduling, and agreed. You brought an additional, unscheduled child, to the appointment and we simply can not let another child in at this time. We are looking out for the safety of all of our own patients and staff. Again, if you were in the dental profession, this would be something you should already know. It's okay if you misunderstood and we were willing to reschedule, but you started making threats about leaving negative reviews and at that point, we can no longer allow you to be a part of the practice. We have our patients best interest at heart and patients making threats don't go well with us. Additionally, frenectomy procedures do not cost $1,400 at this office. Especially for people who have insurance. That is a flat out lie. We don't appreciate you spreading inaccuracies. We wish you the best of luck in the future, wherever that may be."}<//response>

We had a successful lip and tongue tie release for my three month old. I appreciated how thorough the reading material was and the procedure was done both swiftly and carefully with full consideration for my baby’s comfort. The office staff is kind and helpful- went out of their way to tell me the best way to deal with my insurance. Follow up was also amazing. I loved that Dr. Hannanvash does multiple follow up appointments to ensure the release heals properly. Overall we have had a great experience and I would highly recommend this office for their customer service and level of care!<//Review>

<text>Little Star is amazing. They make the experience fun and easy going for my son. We have been going to them since his first tooth came in. They took care of his lip tie as well. State of the art office. They dont pressure and up sale. They dont talk over you. Always a great experience. They even have a great system for covid times that keeps you still feeling welcomed. I always recommend them. If they saw adults I would go to them too.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

We had a fantastic experience with Dr. Hannanvash and her staff.  My 8 year old daughter was referred to Little Star for a potential tongue and lip revision procedure.  I loved the fact that Dr. Hannanvash was able to evaluate her and perform the procedure on the same day.  She and her staff displayed love and care for my daughter, and took the time to explain everything to me, including post-procedure care.  The office is also beautiful and decorated perfectly for children (big and small!).<//review>

I love Little Star!!! Dr Najmeh and her staff are the best! I took my 2 yr old in for an emergency exam due to an accidental fall causing his gums to bleed. I panicked and first thing I thought was  Oh Great! His teeth are loose! So I automatically thought to contact Little Star to schedule an appointment. The front staff are always super friendly over the phone and the scheduling process is so easy and smooth. They were nice enough to give me some advice to care for the injury meanwhile we waited for our appointment the following day.  Our assistant Michelle took us in and did a fantastic job with taking xrays which I greatly appreciate the patience she showed with my little one as he is a bit uncooperative sometimes. Dr Naj came in right away and took a look for any fractures or loose teeth. I honestly don’t know how she was able to do that so calmly and easily since I struggled at home! She’s awesome.. Luckily no fractures or chipped teeth! She then gave me home care instructions and told us to come back in a few months to make sure everything looks healed and well. At the end we got some fun stickers and a goodie bag with a new toothbrush and other daily oral care items. Overall our experience was great and we will definitely be returning!</Review>

Very efficient practice. Scheduling was prompt and easy. We would arrive 5-10 mins before our appointment time and they would take us early. We went here to get a tongue and lip tie resolved. We felt like they took great care of us. One caveat: I wish they would take insurance.</review>

Best dentist and best dental office of all time. I have gone to several offices over the years and Dr. Najmeh is the absolute kindest and most considerate professional person my family has encountered. After having a couple of rather poor experiences with my son't tongue release with Kaiser, we were advised to go to Little Star. Dr. Najmeh could tell that I was a defeated mom and she was so reassuring that she could help us. The entire experience was night and day different from what we experienced before. Now my son can latch better and actually fill his stomach and not stay hungry. She did it correct where two other doctors had not. I highly recommend going here first and not wasting time with other more incompetent doctors. We liked our experience at Little Star so much that we transferred the care of all of our children here. And that did not disappoint! They loved the process and especially loved getting to watch TV while their teeth were being cleaned. This is an office and a doctor I would recommend without hesitation and we will be here for as long as possible! Thank you Dr. Najmeh and staff.<//review>

We went in to little star dentistry when my son was 4 months old.  He had a tongue tie and every other option was done or off the table at this point and my son was not gaining weight as rapidly as the pediatrician said was necessary for proper growth and keeping up my milk supply. Wow! did we have a great experience. The laser procedure was quick and efficient. My husband and I were terrified to go through this again because our first son's tongue tie was done through the insurance and they had to cut underneath his tongue. The procedure got a bit bloody and was pretty hard on our 3 week old. So when we were referred to Little Star we we're super bummed out we had to go through this again, but I can honestly say everything from the staff to the procedure and follow-up was awesome!< /Review>

<Text>We had a wonderful experience at Little Star. The office is so bright and welcoming. There are lots of nice details including their welcome to 'the newest starts'. We were there for my sons lip and tongue tie revision and they made the process smooth, easy, and painless. Dr. Najmeh explained the process carefully and confirmed the lip and tongue tie. I didn't want to do it right away and there was no pressure to do so- in fact she said I could wait until I was ready. The process itself was a little tough to handle but they were so quick and so kind. I am so glad we were referred to them for the procedure and would recommend anyone to the practice. If we were closer I'd bring both my kiddos there for regular dental check ups!< /Text>< Pics>

We started talking my little one to Little Star when he was 2. He was a nervous toddler, and the staff there was very receptive to his needs. At 3.5 he fell and broke a tooth. What could have been a scary expreience at the dentist went so smooth. Najmeh is always making sure you fully understand what is going on. The staff there is receptive and responsive.  I couldn't imagine going anywhere else.</text>

We’ve been with little star pediatric dentistry for a year now. What started out as having my infants tongue and lip tie fixed turned into them being our permanent dentist for our sweet boy. The atmosphere is great and so fun for the kids. It’s a clean place with friendly staff. We’re forever grateful for the staff at little star pediatric dentistry!</Text>

We couldn’t be happier with our experience at Little Star. When we meet Dr. Najmeh I was a bundle of stress. I was triple feeding my six week old daughter and getting zero sleep. Dr. Najmeh diagnosed her posterior tongue tie and lip tie and offered to revise it right then. We opted to do some craniosacral therapy and meet with an IBCLC prior to the revision and scheduled the appointment for two weeks later. The procedure was so fast and the healing process has been as easy as you could expect. My daughter instantly latched better and started transferring enough milk in a matter of days. It can be scary thinking about your little babe having a procedure at such a young age, but it is the sole reason we are able to continue breastfeeding and I am forever grateful.<//Review>

Dr. Najmeh Hannanvash and her staff are  amazing. They are always friendly and polite.  Dr. Najmeh Hannanvash took care of my 6 week old daughter’s tongue and lip tie. She was very thorough with her examination, and the information she provided in order for me to make an informed decision on whether or not to have the correction done. She even showed me what exactly need to be corrected, Once I made the decision she made sure to go over every possible detail from what’s going to happen that day, what I would need to do  and what to expect in the following days. She made she sure I had a video to do the stretches to insure my daughter heeled properly.  I felt very comfortable and confident in Dr. Najmeh Hannanvash preforming the procedure. I very happy with our all around experience, and can not thank her an her staff enough for helping my little one!< /text>

< Review>
From the time I called Little Star to inquire about tie revision for my 2 week-old son, I was so impressed with Dr. Najmeh and her team. The office staff was so friendly and I was able to schedule a consult within 2 days of my initial call.

Dr. Najmeh was so patient answering my questions (& I had lots since I was entrusting her to take care of my newborn). She engaged with me and validated my concerns. She took her time showing me how to do the stretches (which I was very nervous about).

I appreciated that there was time to do the revisions that day, but there was no pressure. I decided to do it that same day because I felt so comfortable with her and her expertise in doing the procedure.

Dr. Najmeh was so good about taking my son into another room for the procedure. She had a clam demeanor and explained exactly what would happen and that they’d have him back in my arms as soon as possible-and they did! He wasn’t even gone 5 minutes (or at least that’s what it felt like).

I can’t say enough good about Dr. Najmeh and her team. I would highly recommend Little Star.< /Review>

Dr. Hannanvash is very professional and kind. My daughter had a posterior tongue tie and had an issue with latching while breast feeding. After the frenectomy, I immediately felt a difference in her latch. The procedure was not a quick fix, we still had to work on technique,  but it was a game changer and made the process much easier!

All of the staff we encountered were great!

I wouldn’t wish this experience on anyone because it means you and your little one are having trouble, but if you’re going to go through this experience, go through it with Dr. Hannanvash at Little Star Pediatric Dentistry.<//Text>

We were referred by our Lactation consultant after finding out our 4mo had lip and tongue tie.
Dr. Najmeh was very kind and patiently answered all of our questions. She explained the details of the frenectomy and aftercare stretches, and even suggested we record them on our phone. We decided to release both ties on the same day- Best decision ever!
It was hard seeing our baby in pain but the procedure didn’t took longer than 5 minutes and I immediately noticed an improvement while nursing.
We had subsequent follow ups to make sure everything was properly healing and Dr. Najmeh and her staff were amazing..very helpful and caring🤗
I highly recommed LS, they will definitely exceed your expectations ⭐️< /Review>

I found out about Dr. Najmeh through the Badass Breastfeeders of San Diego. Yesterday was my daughter's first ever dental appointment and I would say it was a successful visit. For reference, my daughter is 16 months old. Totally worth the one hour drive. I am a resident of South Bay San Diego and drove through morning rush hour traffic just to have my daughter seen by Dr. Najmeh. Very clean office. Warm, welcoming ambience. The staff were all very friendly and professional. The dental assistant working with us noticed that my daughter was pulling at my shirt and wanted to comfort nurse. The dental assistant was the one who told me I could go ahead and nurse her while we discussed my daughter's history.

I wish I had known about Little Star before my daughter was born. I didn't find out this Pediatric specific dental practitioner until my daughter was two months old (too late to add her onto my dental insurance). My daughter was diagnosed with a Posterior tongue tie which I had revised through Rady's, due to insurance purposes. If I could go back in time, I would have added dental coverage for my daughter right after she was born so that I would have been able to have her evaluated by Dr. Najmeh instead. Dr. Najmeh noted some slight reattachment of my daughter's tongue tie and a slight lip tie. She explained what needed to be done in the future but didn't push for anything to be done since my daughter is not currently having any issues.

I will definitely be sticking with Little Star Pediatric Dentistry for all of my daughter's dental needs.<//text>

Had a wonderful experience at little start pediatrics. Our daughter was both tongue and lip tied and Dr. Hannanvash was amazing and did a wonderful job. I really enjoyed having the weekly check ups to ensure it was healing correctly. Dr. Hannanvash was extremely informational and answered all questions that was asked. She made the experience better as I was worried about the surgery. It ended up being quick and exactly how she explained. The front office staff was very friendly and nice. The experience was wonderful in all aspects.<//Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I received a consult from a lactation consultant shortly after discovering my newborn had tongue and lip ties, and I am SO VERY HAPPY I was referred to Little Star!

Everyone was highly professional, compassionate, & well-coordinated! Scheduling a consult was quick & painless, and the online services are OUTSTANDING! Most importantly, everyone is GREAT with the kiddos.

The office is the cleanest most kid-friendly I have ever seen! From the waiting room to the patient care rooms, and even down to the business & appointment reminder cards - everything was perfect!

Dr. Hannanvash is AMAZING! She broke everything down for me play-by-play, making sure I understood the procedure and especially aftercare. Her guidance made the recovery process for my newborn’s lip and tongue tie releases completely stress-free.< /Review>< Pictures>

< review>
Dr. Najmeh was very kind and laid out the facts for us and didn't pressure us to make a decision right away. We felt they took very good care of our daughter. We decided to have her tongue and lip tie revised (lasered). The procudure was less than 5 minutes and there was very little bleeding. We're still having some latching issues but believe that is behavioral at this point and are working with a lactation consultant. This was a much better experience than the tongue tie procedure we did previously with my son that simply snipped under his tongue rather than lasering. The healing was much faster and there was no bleeding. We would definitely recommend Little Star Dentistry.< /review>

Dr Najmeh was highly recommended by both our pediatrician and lactation consultant and did not disappoint.  She has treated both my son and daughter for lip and tongue ties.  Both kids achieved a much stronger latch after treatment.  Dr Najmeh did a fantastic job and I also now recommend her to friends and family.<//Review>

Dr. Najmeh Hannavash came highly recommended and I can see why. She’s organized, efficient, and clear in her communication and service. It’s easy to trust her expertise. And the office is bright and cheerful in both customer service and appearance. Receiving care from Little Star Pediatrics has been a breeze. 2 weeks after a tongue and lip-tie release, our little one is feeling SO much better. He was experiencing acid reflux, gas pains, and tension in his body. The tension has almost completely gone, he’s experiencing less gas (even without burping) and his acid reflux bothers him maybe once every two days, instead of all day and all night. We’re very grateful for Dr. Najmeh Hannavash‘s service and how affordable she made it for our family.< /review>

The follow-up experience for the tongue tie procedure was outstanding. I was angry that I had to wait until 2 months old to get the procedure done due to my insurance (Tricare), but it ended up being OK because of Dr. Najmeh's confidence and proficiency in dealing with babies. I'm excited to work with her when my baby has teeth!</review>

<date>1497623939147<//date><Rate>1< /Rate><Text>The doctor was amazing but the front desk girl was awful!!!! Our baby had a lip and tongue tie that we had lasered the same day as our consultation. We had to pay upfront and then submit the receipt and forms to insurance to get reimbursed. Once we did that we received a partial check in the mail. Our health insurance said that if we had Little Star pediatric dentistry provide a modifier 25 (which is just something that shows that the consultation is separate from the actual procedure) that they could also reimburse us in full for the consultation. When I called Little star pediatric dentistry the front desk woman that answered the phone was extremely rude and condescending. She kept talking to me like I had no idea what I was talking about, and said that she would contact our insurance. She asked for the claim number, and the phone number. Then called me back later to say that she talked to a gentleman with our insurance company and that he said he had no idea what I was talking about either. I called our insurance again yesterday, and they said that they notate every conversation with anyone regarding a claim and that she had never called and then offered to call little star pediatric dentistry for me. She never got a hold of them and said that they were not answering their phones, and said that she had just added the modifier 25 in for us since we had such a difficult time with little star pediatric dentistry. The procedure went well and our baby healed perfectly, but I would definitely never recommend little star pediatric dentistry because of our experience with the woman upfront. Never expected someone that is supposed to be helpful and honest to be so blatantly rude and dishonest.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80dbf83cedf0f1e9:0x635aa0e2e3318e29</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

She and her staff have always made it such a painless experience to take my son to the Dentist and always have us in and out efficiently! I would recommend anyone to choose Little Star, especially if they are worried about certain procedures, your child will be in good hands here! I was very nervous about the lip and tongue tie revision procedure but after having it done here I have nothing but good things to say! The procedure itself was quick and my son had little pain (nothing unmanageable) and the check ups were thorough and since then he has flourished greatly! Dr.Najmeh has always made me feel comfortable in her office and I could not ask for more as a first time parent wondering if I'm doing things "right"! We love Little Star!< /review>< Name>

Choosing Dr. Najmeh was a great decision for our family. Our 1 month old daughter needed a tongue and lip tie lasered and we went with little star dentistry.

In a stressful situation for a new mom, Dr. Najmeh was calming,  educational and reassuring. The procedure was quick and I felt comfortable with  them workong on my baby.

Scheduling was easy and convenient,  the staff was kind,  we will definitely come back when we start to have teeth.<//review>

<Response>None<//Response><Text>We had a great experience with Little Star Pediatric Dentistry. Dr. Najmeh is wonderful, and her nurses and staff were great as well. Having any procedure done on an infant can be scary, but the doctor made us feel assured, informed, and respected. We were seen promptly for all of our appointments, and it was clear that Dr. Najmeh is passionate about her work, and truly cares about each of her patients. The insurance procedure (which is tricky, but by no fault of the dental office) was explained to us clearly, and we were provided with all needed information to submit to our insurance. I would recommend this practice, especially for frenectomies, but also for any other pediatric dental care as well.</Text><Rating>5</Rating></record>

<Review>Dr. Nahjmeh is AMAZING! A pediatrician "clipped" my sons tongue tie when he was born. He still couldnt latch and it was just problem after problem. Finally at 3 months I took him to Dr. Nahjmeh, my son had a lip tie and the tongue tie wasnt completely clipped. I am happy to say my son latches like a champion now! I cannot thank her enough she is amazing!!!!!!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80dbf83cedf0f1e9:0x635aa0e2e3318e29< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

This review is based on my experience with the Dentist, her staff, and the Office Manager. I will start with the positive part, which was my interactions with the DR. alone was very positive. I was not impressed or care for her staff. They all seemed like and gave the impression of not knowing their role in the office or how things operated. For example, I asked the nurse if I could stay in the room to nurse after seeing the doctor and she fumbled with her words and then ended with "I am new so I am not sure." This was a common statement I received more than once from multiple individuals. Also the statement "We just opened so there is a lot going on" is another common statement I received. She was recommended by my lactation consultant for my 3 month olds tongue tie and lip tie. I wanted to get this issue fixed ASAP, but because they were moving offices they could not see my daughter until a week out from when I was calling because I was seeking for my insurance to cover the procedure and visit. I called ahead of time asking for specific charges. It was explained to me by the office manager at the time that "it would be covered, unless I came in this week (to the old office) and you will have to pay out of pocket." I did not want to pay 650$ for this when I have insurance that would cover it. I did have a pediatrician and an ENT office that would cover the procedure, not even a co-pay. I went to her because she was recommended and they confirmed on the phone before I was in the office that I had insurance and yes it would be covered 100%. The day of the procedure came and it was not until after the procedure that it was brought to my attention that my daughter was not covered and I would have to pay out of pocket and submit a "superbill." I did not appreciate this, but they assured me I would be reimbursed. This all occurred the last week of March, it is now June. I only received a small partial reimbursement from my insurance and was explained by them that they should not have charged me that much and I was to get the rest from the office. I had faith that this office would stand by their word and good name to give me back my money they said would be reimbursed. I have now spoken with the Dr. herself and the new office manager and they have both said they will not give me my money back because "someone has to pay for the labor and procedure that was done." They admitted they were in the wrong and it should have been handled differently, but still will not reimburse me. This is just one of my issues with this office. This is very unprofessional! When opening a business you need to have staff and things aligned before taking ones money. I am very upset with this type of business. Also, on one of my follow-up visits I had to wait over an hour when asking about my daughter situation and was told she will see me. It wasn't till over an hr of waiting with a 3 month old in an office that she was too busy and could not see me by her staff. Rude. Now, this is all on her ways of handling business, as for her procedures. I have yet to see any problems with what was altered in my child's mouth. I have to say she did a good job and I feel it was the best route to take when having this done. She did not seem to be in pain, which was my personal goal with her. I really wish I could say I would come back here and recommend her to others, but I do not and will not for the purpose that I am still out 400$ of my own money when I have insurance that could have covered this. I just wish they would own their wrong and reimburse me at least most of my money.</text>

We will strive to make the experience more clear moving forward for future families. As was discussed on the phone with you, you are receiving a reimbursement check which has already been mailed out to you, so portions of this review are inaccurate. All the same, we wish you and your loved one the best moving forth.'}</Response>

<text>I cannot emphasize enough how wonderful Dr. Nahjmeh and her staff are! First of all, she has the friendliest staff I have ever encountered in a medical office. The receptionist Tenisha is so sweet and happy from phone call to visit. The hygienist who did the cleaning was such a sweetheart to my 4yo son, I wish Remembered her name! Dr. Najmeh is kind and very easy to talk to. She is knowledgeable, and so patient with my spirited kiddo. They spoke directly to him and were so kind even when he was uncooperative! They played his favorite movie, Toy Story, which he can watch while he gets his cleaning! And then he got a cool bag of “treats”! I’m so jealous! Fun stickers and sunglasses and a mickey toothbrush! How did they know we love Mickey? She also performed a Frenectomy on my 10mo baby and he is doing AMAZING! She is so so sweet and took great care of him...he didn’t even cry. I’m so grateful that I found this place. Dr. Najmeh is such a pro. This place is a dream! Tv’s on the ceiling, you guys! It’s clean, it’s fun, it’s PEACEFUL!! I drive all the way from Hemet...it’s worth every mile!  Go go go! I wish she was my dentist!</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Our family is new to the area, so it’s always difficult to find the right medical team for the family. We are so grateful we went to Joiner Orthodontics. The team is taking all appropriate covid considerations. The treatment coordinator, Victoria, is fabulous and made my daughter laugh and feel comfortable. Dr. Dan was great and talked to my daughter directly about her treatment plan and explained with photos and videos. I really cannot have asked for a better experience. Thank you so much for easing the anxiety of my daughter. We look forward to working with you.</text>

My daughter needed braces. We had attended consultations at a few different local offices. We ended up having some "not so great" experiences. I had a friend recommend Dr Joiner. We were totally impressed and really comfortable right away. This is by far the best Orthodontic practice in Santa Cruz County. Dr. Joiner and his staff are amazing. They really go 110%. The facilities are beautiful, clean and inviting. I highly recommend them to anyone, at any age, who needs orthodontic treatment.</Review>

Highly recommend taking your child to see Dr.Joiner. My 8 year old daughter said the office environment is fun & she cannot wait to get her first ortho treatment. We would give more than 5 stars! Victoria made us feel safe (took temperature, provided hand sanitizers, and ensured everything gets sanitized between patients), made us laugh with her funny jokes, and good with kids and adults! The staff are amazing!</Text>

Both of my children have gotten their braces at Dr. Joiner's. All of the staff we started with are still there. Everyone is always friendly, cheerful and relaxed. It's obvious Dr Joiner loves his work. The equipment is state of the art. The office is beautiful. The chairs are comfortable, and the coffee is strong and delicious!< /Text>

<Time>1576165923094<//Time><Rate>5<//Rate><Text>This is clearly a state-of-the-art facility, but it stands out even more for being patient-conscious in design. From the moment you step in the door, the cozy waiting room, coffee station, and overall spaciousness makes this a comfortable experience. Victoria is ready to greet you with her effervescent personality, and Carol at the front desk is attentive and responsive. Dr. Joiner, himself, is pleasant and easy to talk to. He brings decades of experience to the conversation while remaining aware that he is new to your mouth and must understand its uniqueness.  I have consulted with several orthodontists in Santa Cruz County. As an older adult, hopefully pursuing orthodontia for the last time, I do not want to mess around or accept less than the best. I believe I have found it.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Beautifully designed dental office space, everyone is very personable and friendly the minute you walk in the door. Victoria will take good care of you during your first visit and she may even sing to you on her pink microphone (make sure to ask). I have heard so many good things about Dr Joiner and they are all true. He is a calming and welcoming presence. He will make you feel right at home, explains all treatment options well and gives you the best options for healthy looking teeth!  Dr Joiner's offices ROCKS!<//Text>

<Text>The best orthodontist office I've ever been to - Dr Joiner and his staff really do a great job of making sure you're informed and comfortable. They went out of their way to see me at the same time as my daughter so I wouldn't have to return the next day for my scheduled appointment. And the coffee is really good too!  ;)< /Text>< Pictures>

Friendly, professional staff. Dr. Joiner and his staff are welcoming and approachable. I very much appreciate that braces were not pushed as the only treatment option for our 12-year old as they are not medically necessary.</Review>

The best! Dr. Joiner and staff are simply the best! Dr. Joiner's practice manages to combine state-of-the-art (and art it is!) orthodontics and great efficiency with an extraordinarily pleasant and personable delivery of services. That is to say that everyone is knowledgeable, fast, friendly and NICE! The office is tremendously kid-friendly from the decor to the incentive programs (and goodies) that encourage compliance. From the very beginning, we were impressed. My daughter's initial assessment was extremely thorough. We were informed of exactly what work she needed to have done and how that would happen. Throughout her treatment (nearly two years now) all of our questions have been more than satisfactorily answered, and she is making great progress. Look no further!</Text>

My daughter had braces put on in the morning and that evening around 8pm Dr. Joiner called her at the house to see how she felt and if she was experiencing discomfort. He is the best! Love his heart and dedication to his patients.<//Review>

<Review>Leased an office for two years. Had a really great time here. My office faces Greenland Metropolis and the I-10 Freeway. Fantastic view, especially at night. Titán staff are very polite and friendly. Liked the tea and coffee that are provided free to tenants and visitors. Donuts remind me of happy Fridays. Feeling sad I have to leave because my project is over. Will definitely consider Titan if I come back for new projects in LA.<//Review>< gmap_id>

<Text>i have been meaning to write this review for quite some time. We met with the owner Edwin and manager Rebekah to tour the facility in November.  It was a great experience with top notch amenities.  Pricing was extremely reasonable for the location and all the services offered with the space.  Views were amazing.  Both Edwin and Rebekah were very quick and responsive.  I would highly recommend for any small business looking to impress.<//Text>< pictures>

<text>I've rented space from Titan, among other executive suites vendors, and as a demanding customer was thoroughly happy with their  outstanding service and the space they provided.  Their conference rooms can be easily booked, often available, competitively priced.  The reception staff is professional and styling.  The space itself is beautiful with a very clean modern design.  And the Titan folks are very responsive to technical issues.  Highly recommend them!</text></record>

<review>Edwin and his team do a fantastic job. Not only are they professional and competent, they're friendly and fun. Moreover, everyone else in these executive suites feel the same. The negative reviews are from competitors or losers. These are well run executive offices, with amazing views. The space is also sparkling and brand-spanking new. You will not find better offices unless you are willing to pay an arm and a leg!<//review>< pics>

I love running my business here. I have had so many issues with my previous landlords and for once I can say it’s been two years of a great experience. Rebekah at Titan has helped me so many times and my clients love the receptionists. Fredy has always come through with my last minute chaos. Generally, everybody is like family to me at this point. I highly recommend Titan Offices for anybody looking for a long term relationship oriented business office. Cheers to many more years of great experiences! 🍾<//text>

<review>I have been leasing an office space for about two years now and I have been thoroughly impressed with the management, cleanliness, attentiveness and professionalism of the Titan family. They take care of my needs immediately. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a professional and modern office space with beautiful views.

Absolutely horrible service.NEVER EVER USE THIS SERVICE. I am 100% honest and a very easy going person. These people scammed me out of a ton of money. I was told that the offices would be one price and when I arrived there they attempted to charge me hundreds of dollars more per hour. I am a 100% honest person and if you are reading this review you can contact me personally and I can show you what these offices did. These people treated me so badly I plan on going on as many review sites as possible to expose them for what they really are. I was talked down to and treated like an animal as soon as I got to the front desk. I was told I would be charged hundreds per hour if I continued to sit in the lounge area. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not use this service. You will be treated inhumanely and also scammed. I was told one price and one thing over the phone then they tricked me into being able to run my credit card so when I showed up at the facility they tried to charge me hundreds more. There is plenty of other offices in Los Angeles where you will #1 not get treated like an animal and #2 will not be scammed. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE. They charged me for providing me no service whatsoever, threatened me, and tricked me into running my credit card. STAY AWAY.I would not bother writing this review as well as several others I plan on writing if I was not treated like total garbage!<//text>

I honestly tried to nitpick and look for reasons to give some feedback so I can make the overall experience over here better, but I can't couldn't think of anything. It's been 2 month since I signed the lease with Rebecca, and I haven't had a single issue since. I remember moving my things in late at night the next day, and I somehow managed to screwed up my login info that the she for my personal Cisco Wi-Fi portal. I emailed the front desk staff close to midnight that day, and got an email from Marcella at 9am in the morning with a link and detailed step by step explanation on how to fix it. Marcella, Alondra, and Jajaura (the Titan front desk crew) are the best I've seen. I've worked in the service industry for over five years and managed a front desk staff, but they're awesome at what they do. Always great you with a smile as soon as you come up the elevator, even if they're swamped and ask how you're doing. Couldn't be happier with this decision, and I highly recommend checking it out if you're starting up a business or need a location that makes you look good infant of clients. Lastly, schedule the tour with Rebecca. She didn't rush the tour at all and did an awesome job at explaining everything so you know exactly what payments to expect and when. Very excited to start my first tax practice from here and offering an awesome first impression to all our future clients!< /Text>

I was able to efficiently use Davinci's booking service online while in transit at Seattle airport and secured a space for me to present future clients my company’s marketing plan for their product. I acquired a room that had a lovely view of the city with a beverage service that provided a very comfortable and professional atmosphere for our meeting. I'll undoubtedly continue to use Davinci rooms to help ease my business travels.<//review>

Decent office, a lot of noise, our meeting was interrupted by the staff to show the room to another potential client.

Edit: after a year of when I reviewed this office location they reached out to apologize and this in my book earned them an extra star!< /Text>

I lived in Armenia for several years and this place definitely made me feel like I was back again. The kebabs and ikibirs were super good! Food was pretty quick and we were in and out in less than 45 minutes.</Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>This place is ridiculously expensive, been there with friends ordered a few things (no barbecue, kebab and no alcohol) and paid per person more than $55. Food is normal and waiter was very nice, but I will never go to this place again, because of GREEDY OWNERSHIP who seeks to scam costumers and willing to get paid by cash.</review>< pictures>

The black bartender clearly hates white people. Waited forever to serve us always finishing and contributing to conversations before addressing my friends and I. Was rude when I asked about drinks.<//Review>

Cool dive bar but can be hit or miss. Just don't go in doing too much and expect that to be okay. Just have an open mind and all will be well.< /Text>

Great auto repair and service shop. Car is fixed, price was decent, and I don't feel taken advantage of. As a matter of fact, I'm scheduling to take my other vehicle there as well. Their associate, James, was very knowledgeable, clear and precise in estimate and evaluation. I am comfortable driving my car again.<//Review>

I am 55 years old and I have to say this the first time I went to a Auto repair shop and did not feel ripped off. These guys are the best. I will be taking all my vehicles there from now on. They are very cautious and caring, Also very knowledgeable. I highly recommend this place.</Review>

<text>One of the best auto care experiences I've had. Needed my tires balanced after a shoddy tire installation job (at a different shop), dropped in this morning while things weren't too busy and Coast Auto took care of the tire balance job an hour later. George, the owner, just GETS it when it comes delivering excellent customer services/building a relationship with his customers. Felt like my car was in great hands from the get go. Bringing my car here for all future auto care needs.</text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Their prices for labor is reasonable and keep me in the loop the whole time. Their counter employees where friendly and keep me at ease during the time I was there.

I really am disappointed at the service. I went in on Friday and left my vehicle there till Saturday  for a brake issue and was told they are fine, when they are clearly not.
I now have to drive with brakes that are hazardous not safe. For a week because a I can not afford to leave the vehicle and loose a days work.

Secondly I had a check ingien light on it cost me 125.00 to tell me I need sensor which I could have went  to Auto Zone and been told that for free.

I have taken my vehicles there for some time now and Im not sure I should continue this puts my life in danger and is just bad business from whom I thought I can trust my life and my children's live in there hands ....< /Review>

I live in Santa Clarita and I've known George Mack for 30 yrs. When I had a issue with my 2006 Dodge Ram, he assured me he would find the reason it won't smog. Very talented crew of people he has there. And yes they fix the issue and it drives like new! Highly recommend his shop services<//Text>

From oil changes, fixing a flat tire and fixing an instrument cluster. You name it, these guys can handle it. The customer service representatives are very nice and handle themselves in a very professional manner. I would definitely recommend them to others. Coast Auto Care have met all of expectations.</review>

I wish I could give this place ZERO stars!! Spent $1300 and the SAME codes that I gave to them are still there after driving less than 50miles!!! On top of all that, guess what?? I had to jump my van this morning during street sweeping so I wouldnt get a ticket!! The repairs made were on alternator, starter, and tune up... over $1300 just to have the SAME problem... #dispute...</text>

<Text>STAY AWAY!!!!  This shop is unable to diagnose a car further than plugging in the computer and reading the codes given without any due diligence to diagnose the root cause.  Bill diagnosed my car and recommended replacing computer, all oxygen sensors, and the EVAP Solenoid valve because these were the codes he was getting from the computer.  However, Bill failed to do any testing of the mechanical components.  Bill did not even drive the car before giving his recommendation.  I paid for the repair based on Coast Auto's recommendation, and immediately upon driving the car out of the parking lot it was demonstrating the same issues.  The repair cost me $1,500 (replacing computer, o2 sensors and valve) and the actual issue was the Catalytic converters, which interact with the oxygen sensors.  Any mechanic should have tested the converters before giving a recommendation to replace the electrical components  I have filed a formal complaint against Coast Auto, and George Mack.  Please avoid the problems that are inevitable when dealing with Coast Auto.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< username>

<resp>{'time': 1580407812853, 'text': "Per your review I would like to respond and give actual facts of this situation. Since the car was dropped of its funny how a NON technician can arbitrarily assume they know or understand what happened with the diagnosis when they were not in the shop(the car was dropped off) also, Bill is a licensed smog technician and a Master Technician for 20 years prior to diagnosing your car. So as far as the State Of California is concerned he is definitely a well seasoned and top diagnosis technician in the state of California. It's pretty easy for a layman without technical ability to make uninformed assumptions. Your car has more than one issue. The first issue is the o2 sensors and the 02 heater damaged the computer. Also, having this in mind brings us back to the catalytic converter. There was no cat converter fault code stored in the cars computer at that time of diagnosis. My question is would you like a shop to replace very expensive cat converters just because? Repair shops cannot just replace parts without proper diagnosis as we did for you. Finally, the issue with the cat converters is that you drive wide open throttle from every light(as my technician mentioned after riding with you to drop you off at the gym). The  small v6 engine Camaro you are driving full throttle is trying to compensate by flooding the cat converters with unburned raw fuel which will cause them  to be over saturated with fuel eventually causing the need to replace the converters. The scan tool we use tells us the story of the driving habits of the driver(similar to a black box in an airplane does). The v8 camaro is the engine and setup you need if you want to act like a street racer from light to light. When I explained that fact to you inside our customer lounge you sounded surprised. A v6 camaro is NOT a race car sir, there are safeguards in the way of computers to protect itself from the abuse of it's driver."}<//resp><gmapID>0x80dd315c2b3dbb8b:0x7b8670dc17572a25< /gmapID></record>

<Date>1580522330187< /Date><pictures>None</pictures><review>TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! BAD TECHNICAL WORK!!!! i WILL NEVER USE THIS SHOP AGAIN!!!!  COMPLAINT IS FILED IN THE SUPERIOR COURT
The actual facts are below:
-Dropped off my Chevy Camaro for diagnosis
-Informed your employee that the car was not getting power during acceleration, engine seemed to be missing, and exhaust was restricted.
-Also informed you employee that there were several codes coming from the computer and there has to be a root cause.
--The car was left at your shop for an entire business day
-Your employee called me and told me that Bill was unable to obtain the codes with the standard scanner and would need to use another more technical scanner to diagnosis the problem
-The technician then diagnosed the problem with the same codes that the scanner from AutoZone received.
-I then came into your shop and asked for the keys because I did not believe that all of the electronic components needed to be replaced.  --------Additionally, that there has to be another issue with the car causing these electronic parts to error out and that the dealership would give the correct diagnosis.
-George Mack the owner, then guaranteed that Bill's diagnosis was correct.
-Further, George Mack went on to persuade me to allow his shop to complete the work, by telling me that Harbor Chevrolet only wanted the business.  Also, he guaranteed this diagnosis would correct the issue
subsequent to the repair I drove the car and had the same issues immediately after leaving your shop
--I then requested that Bill properly diagnose the car
-Bill and I then took the car for a drive at which time I opened the throttle fully to simulate the problem
-Bill then drove the car in a way and at a speed that would not cause the car to have the same issue
-I then told Bill that the car would not simulate the issue if the throttle was not fully open from stop, he said he would open it on the next hill
-Bill then opened and immediately felt the restriction
-During this drive Bill also made a comment that this car has a temperature gauge, newer cars don't have this gauge
-This lead me to believe that Bill had not even driven the car and just used the computer
-I then attempted to negotiate with Coast Auto's owner George Mack and he did nothing about the problem
-After leaving my car there for two additional days and realizing that this shop is a fraud.  I decided to file action in court

George Mack is assuming that I am coming to these conclusions with a limited knowledge of automobiles.  In addition, he honestly believes that someone is not capable of researching a issue and becoming familiar with a particular subject matter.  Further, a Chevy exhaust system is not rocket science.  A simple google search of catalytic converter and O2 sensors will give you plenty of reference points to educate yourself.  Moreover, George Mack is not considering that other ASE certified technicians are saying that there is very low probability that all the electrical components will go out.  Further, there should have been back flow testing when the O2 sensors were removed.

I requested that the shop return the parts that were changed and they were only able to return the old computer and not the other parts, even though they are required to return parts.

Bottom line is stay clear of this type of headache.  No one needs to deal with a shop that is not diligent and only uses computers to diagnose vehicles without doing further diligence when necessary.  See the owners response below and understand that I am not asking for  fee converters only for the original job that I agreed to be done correctly.<//review>< name>

<rating>1</rating><resp>{'time': 1580850028583, 'text': 'To be fair after we diagnosed your car we explain to you that you had more than one issue. Part of your issue is when you drive a car wide open throttle at all times the computer will then compensate by loading the catalytic converter’s full of fuel which will cause you to have unburned fuel in the catalytic converter‘s which will damage them internally. We asked you to bring it back the other day so we could double check our work and for sure that is the problem. Your car is a V-6 not a performance tune V8 Camaro which you would not have this problem with. We ran the data and your computer shows us that you drive full throttle all the time. My technician rode with you and stated you drive full throttle all the time. When you returned you wanted Catalytic Converter‘s for free. That’s just not reasonable considering the computer of your car gives us a whole history of how you drive. I explained to you all of these things the other day in hopes that you would understand clearly. In closing, I am open to a conversation to perhaps come to a resolution.'}< /resp><gmap_id>0x80dd315c2b3dbb8b:0x7b8670dc17572a25< /gmap_id></record>

They set me up with a great price for all four tires brand new as well as my spare tire they gave me a big discount for that. Thanks again I’d highly recommend anyone that needs anything done to the car don’t hesitate to come by<//review>< pictures>

Me and my family have been coming to this mechanic shop for a while now. The shop Is Awesome from the owner to the technicians. You can take your car in from the simplest things to oil changes to more dramatic things like transmission work.

I've always trusted Coast Auto Care with leaving my car there. Keep up the good work.</Review>

Coast Auto Care and tires always take care of me. I've been taking my 3 Series BMW here for the last 3 years. These guys gave me a killer price for a set of 4 tires.
These guys are real professional and friendly they never try to upsell you anything you don't need. I would definitely recommend to anyone that needs with any auto repair needs.</Review>

<Review>I was having trouble with my car recently and so i came here and to begin with, I felt so welcomed and right away they began to help me. The service was super fast, I was in and out. They fixed my gauge meter, and it’s working so well! Next time I need my car fixed I’ll gladly come here again!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1580408700996, 'text': 'Thank you for the nice words we really appreciate it.

The most professional and honest experience I've had in a long time recently moved from Chicago to California and had several experiences with unfair non honest technicians and Reps from auto shops, Coast Auto Care was extremely professional very honest and very Cooperative on completing the things I needed at the time that I needed them done, Coast Auto is the spot, I'm a faithful customer for life.</Text>

<Text>Well,At first everything was fine, they explained what was going on bit come to later realize I was being ripped off.i initially went cause my car wouldn’t start,they said it was battery,changed it,still having same issue,it’s the throttle body,paid 500,still doing it,oh it’s the connections, paid 350.stull does it,went back again they said they put copper wiring,it still did it gen stopped. They Mickey moused the cables held with electrical tape,they took it off the mount and removed the cover..like wow! This is why I never trust car shops! Always get ripped off,I pad for other things too and they didn’t really fix anything.i needed a sponsor or something cause my speedometer wasn’t moving,brake light abs lights on,hey said it a part that’s 1300 but they can do for 750,that sounded fishy so I didn’t do. Guess what..only going to cost me$100. Don’t these places understand that if you don’t lie and overcharge people they will come back but no,let’s upset them and take money they don’t have. Don’t go here,so not worth it.  I spent about 1300 there and still have problems</Text>< resp>

Horrible service went in to replace my spark plugs and a few other things and my car ended up in worst condition than i took it in and for starters they put the wrong spark plugs on my car so it broke down in the middle of the freeway. And in the process of flushing my fuel injectors they broke one and they did not replace it or informed me of it. I will not recommend this place to anyone!< /Text>

< review>
Waited here for an hour without even being helped. Got a pedicure,  after waiting for an hour. They said 30 minutes. I sat in the chair waiting for an hour. Definitely no tip. Hire more workers. Only came here because Nova nail salon was closed. Don’t recommend to anybody.</review>

Accompanied my wife to get her nails refilled, there was only 2 people, we were first on the list, waited patiently for about an hour and the person after us was attended before us and they were there for no more than 10mins! Talk about customer service,  never again. Highly wouldn't recommend to anyone.< /text>

This place is horrible!! They didnt even do the nails somewhat like the ones i asked for 😑. I showed them a picture with ombre nails and i walked out with only red nails ✌✌. The employees were nice but only before we payed then became really rude after when we were drying our nails post painting. They also had us waiting FOREVER and there were over 5 workers 😕😕. They also pick and choose prices depending on the person...< /Text>

Not a recommended place to come. You walk in and they tell you its only a 30 min wait and you end up waiting for 2 hours. They tell you to take a seat, you thinking they are going to work on you and you wait another 30 to 40 min. They have no social interaction with customers, very poor customer service and unprofessional. They need to hire more people ASAP!!!<//text>

(Translated by Google) They charge dearly, they take time to attend and in the end they don't do their job well.

I waited for a customer to exit the store to enter and the worker was mad about that.  I didn’t make much of it until he kept harassing me about it inside the shop.  This is a shame considering how much of a pain it can be to get to this location, it’s honestly not worth it.

I have been here plenty of times but I have never experienced this.  I will not be coming back.</Review>< Response>

I have loved Adult Books since I was a kid. It is an iconic piece of history and a wonderful place to explore, to let your mind wander, to walk in the footsteps of many.< /Review>

The arcades are clean and private. Good variety of videos. Machine is cash only. Picked up these underwear my last visit. Only had red in my size. Hope they have in more colors soon because they fit great.</Text>

< Review>
I order ballons for pick up. I walked in and I was waiting in the pick up area to pick up my ballons. Come to find out that was not the line for picking up ballons. But they didn't not have any signs saying ballon pick up. Also they don't have any signs on the floor saying 6 feet apart!. Only in the ballon area. But even that people where not respecting the 6 feet distance. And plus their was a customer that came in without a mask. And the employees never said anything to that customer.< /Review>

I ordered and paid for some balloons last week to pick them up today November 26. They got  my info and everything. And they're close 😡. They didn't even send me any massage to let me now about it. Terrible! 👎< /Review>

<user_name>cmeteryxdrive<//user_name><Review>Terrible service again by the same lady the few times I’ve seen her she has an attitude problem and very unprofessional. The line was all over the place and the lady in charge of the balloons told me “that’s not where the line starts, that’s why I’m fixing the line” that the starting line was shown on a balloon. Customers will obviously be searching for a starting line sign not a balloon !!! Same woman also told another family if they were in line to “ scoot over for her”.< /Review>< GmapID>

Wont come here again until someone makes sure their staff get some customer service classes. I went today to buy graduation stuff for my daughter.  And I got the most rude cashier. It got me upset because she had the nerve to tell me I cant return anything back because its final purchase on graduation products. It wasn't in a low voice. I didnt hear any of the other cashiers tell any other customers the same thing to any of them that was truly very embarrassing. I didnt go and spend $1 or $2 dollars everytime I go I love to spend more than $100 because I always find everything I need here. I know we are all going to things especially with this quarantine but theres no need to act like this.< /review>

Has items for every occasion. Prices are a little overwhelming, but you can buy costume sets for a little more than the costume's price. The costume selection system is very quick & simple.<//Review>

<Review>Need to open more register. The line is moving too slow with so many employees walking around. I ordered a balloon set and I forgot to get a weight. So as Gustavo was blowing up the balloon I asked if I get purchase one without getting back in the long line with only one cashier open. He said no even tho he had a drawer open. Please remember customer service is the most important for returning customers. Cathy was great tho!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<review>I really like this location because the employees are friendly and it's close to my house. We needed one near south central. But it was a bit empty. Not sure if we went there in a season take down or they simply didn't have merch.< /review>< user_name>

<Review>The people that work there are so rude and I'm assuming that they might not have enough space in the back for storage because when I went there was a mess of boxes in the back everywhere. I wanted Minnie mouse invitations and they didn't have any! I'm assuming they were in a box not put on the shelf. And they are REALLY slow.< /Review><userid>115103913132575878226</userid><time>1547244330852<//time><rating>1< /rating><response>None< /response></record>

<Review>Don’t go here. I picked up my online order and part of the costume was missing but didn’t realize until I got home. What a mess! The employees need some real retail training and the store is so sloppy. Go to the party city near Atwater. At least the floors there aren’t sticky.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

I had a costume emergency right before a play performance,  and the girls here took their time and looked through all the inventory in the back...and found exactly what I needed!! I had already been at another Party City store, and didn't get helped the same. They saved my fundraiser performance of the play!! THANK YOU Carla and Angie!!< /Text>
