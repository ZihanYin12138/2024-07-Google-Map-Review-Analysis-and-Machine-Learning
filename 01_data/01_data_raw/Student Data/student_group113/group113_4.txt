They are popular, so best to plan a little in advance, especially if you wish to book through Zocdoc (so your time slot stays available.)

Lis Faer is an amazing professional. She’s one of the few medical professionals I trust in cosmetic dermatology. She’s also a compassionate person who treats the whole person.<//Text>

<rating>5</rating><Review>Dr. Wolfe is very caring skin doctor, especially since I just went through radiation getting breast cancer.
I go to her for checking if any skin cancer is happening due to skin cancer in my two families, lucky no skin cancer for me once again. And she listens to everything you say and always has good advice, too.
I recommend so highly this office!</Review><user_name>Sharon Staley</user_name>< pics>

<rating>5<//rating><text>From the date we (my friend and I), made the appointment, through the timeliness at the reception desk, and then the extra-fine dermatological care by Dr. Susan Wolf, to the setup of the next appointment, this medical center is A+. There was one small glitch but such a minor issue as to make it something we could ignore. I've been dealing with skin cancer since 1979, so I have lots of skincare experiences with which to compare this. Highly recommend this physician!</text>< pics>

Dr. Sorell is amazing. She’s caring and empathetic. I never felt that she was judging me about why I was in. Truly amazing!
The receptionist(s) at the front? Totally different story, I would give them 0 stars. They look unhappy, mad and bored, which can be unpleasant when you first walk in, but just remind yourselves you’re there to see your doctor.<//Review>

The California Skin Institute and Dr. Webb are great! I’ve been a patient of Dr. Webb for many years and he has always done a great job of taking care of my dermatology needs. It’s great that they also have other offices when I need to get an appointment sooner. Plus they have my records on file.

I highly recommend Dr. Webb and the California Skin Institute!<//text>

The front desk staff is always knowledgeable and helpful. I typically go to Candy regularly for Dermasweep and she has kept my skin in the best condition possible for many years. She guides me well regarding which products to use and how to use them. My scary, no treatment for months, Covid skin proved just how valuable Candy’s treatments are for keeping it healthy and warding off signs of aging as much as possible.<//review>

<Text>I usually go to the Redwood City CA Skin Institute but I needed to see someone right away. They found me an appointment at the San Mateo branch and was treated by Dr. Sorrell. She was magnificent. She’s a very good listener and patiently explained what was going on with my skin and how she was was going to treat it. I highly recommend this dermatology practice.</Text>< time>

<review>I adore my doctor.  Dr. Sorrell is all about helping me achieve the healthiest skin possible.  Since I am of African heritage, it has been  a challenge to get treated for hormonal cystic acne. Dr. Sorrell is determined to help me. She is caring and brilliant.  My case is unique and difficult. She identifies a plan and  adjusts my care when needed.  My skin has never felt better and is clearing up.  Like I said, she is brilliant.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< time>

<review>Came in to see Dr. Susan D. Wolf, She sounded and seems very knowledgeable. I told her about my condition and she patiently listened to everything I said and responded to everything I said accordingly.

She explained all the scenarios in the treatment process from the beginning till the end. She also explained the best case scenario in the worst case scenario.

She did not make me feel rushed or ignore what I was saying about my self diagnosis. Thank you  for the samples that saved me a headache at the pharmacy.</review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<Review>Our family has been under Dr. wolf’s care for two generations. My bother and I brought our 95-year old father to see Dr. Wolf today. She examined my father with her utmost patience and kindness and explained to us in details. After she learned that we had to pay out of our own pocket because my father’s insurance did not cover. Not only Dr. Wolf waved the injection fees, but she also gave us a discount on the office visit fees. We do appreciate her expertise, her kindness, and her compassion. We don’t think we can find any doctor as compassionate as she is in the Bay Area. Thank you very much, Dr. Wolf!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1596217881253, 'text': 'We’re so happy to hear you’ve had a great experience with California Skin Institute.

Excellent practice in every way. Support staff is professional and provides superb service. Dr Sorrell  is the best dermatologist I have ever had. She was meticulous  in examining my every skin spot and did not miss anything. She offered lots of advice, asked questions about me and has a wonderful bedside manner. Dr Sorrell took her time with me, did not rush me and took extra care to be sure I received a thorough body check. She is excellent at what she dies and shows she really cares . I loved my first experience at the CA Skin Institute and  will recommend them to others.  I am so happy to find such a fine dermatology practice.<//Text>

I received superior and excellent  care from
Dr. Peter Webb and his staff today on 7/6/20. Their care was courteous, prompt, professional, thorough and immaculate. The front desk staff was courteous and prompt. Their Covid 19 precautions for staff and patients is the best that I have experienced during this pandemic.< /text>

<review>Dr. Susan Wolf was fantastic!
No wait time- I signed my paperwork and was seen almost immediately.

Dr. Wolf was quick and efficient. I was hesitant to visit her after seeing some of these reviews, but I am so glad I did! She was quick and knowledgeable, answered all of my questions.

She's definitely not one for small talk, so my only note is that you should come prepared with questions and concerns already, and she will do a great job answering them. For me, I appreciate that she focused on giving you the best care without the extra fluff, but I understand that is not for everyone.

I would be happy to come back here in the future if needed :)<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1578076719538, 'text': 'We take pride in delivering top quality care here at California Skin Institute. Thanks so much for giving us a positive rating!'}< /response>< GmapID>

Dr. Wolf is a great dermatologist. I have been seeing her for years. Weird how some people here don’t like her style, saying things like “she is not attentive to their needs”. Maybe they are looking for a different style of doctor. I am looking for a great dermatologist who knows her stuff.  I really like her. She is super attentive to your skin and notices every little thing, then takes action in your best interests. High five!</Text>

This location is super accessible to wheelchair users, most of the staff is friendly, although there are some people that don't even engage at all which is a little uncomfortable. Dr. Wolf is not only extremely good at what she does, she has a great bedside manner as well. She's very compassionate and always gives me the best advice.</Text>

I go to Dr. Wolf at CSI, have been seeing her for several years, and really like her. She is friendly and straightforward. The rest of the staff are also friendly and very efficient.< /review>

Doctor and nurse are really professional and helpful. The front desk employee seems indifferent and disconnected. When I inquired about next steps after the visit, the front desk appeared very impatient. As they are the face of the clinic, they should be trained and advised to treat patient with care as well.</Text>

Doctor’s assistant came in had me wrap a towel on my face after my procedure and told me she would be back in 2 minutes. Twenty minutes later I was still in the room with a towel wrapped around my face. I took the towel off, went outside the room and asked the staff if there was anything they needed from me. I was told she forgot about me and I could go home.

I left the office and drove home. On my way home I had three missed calls and an email that I had left without paying. I called back to pay over the phone but I would expect more communication, attentiveness and cohesion on their team and not have my experience end this way.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

< review>
be aware this place is out to make every penny they can!!! I had a small skin tag procedure done it took 10 mins to do. I quoted in person since I knew my insurance didn't cover skin tag removals. They quoted me an amount and I paid it that upfront same day. They have this terrible process at check-in that it feels like a bank, now I know why!

the appointment took 10 mins total... I paid what they wanted but long and behold here I am with a new invoice from them for an additional charge...

when  I called to let them know I paid in advance they said yes, that is for the services but not for the visit. meaning I had to pay a separate fee for having the appointment. ridiculous. they are used to taking advantage of the insurance companies and so they use the same strategies with direct billing to customers.

Be aware they will quote you a price and months later you will get a new bill from them, also know that they want your credit card to keep on file.

I should off listen to the other reviews about this crooked place but  I didnt! :(

By the way, the skin tag removal was NOT good and left me with burn marks...< /review>

Visited California Skin Institute to check my eczema and nail fungus. Dr. Sorrell was very nice and use the time efficiently and wanted to make sure i had nail fungus, she took a sample from my nail to send it to the lab. As i had high deductible insurance I wanted to know how much would that cost but unfortunately nobody knew anything how much would be the lab cost for a nail fungus test and did not bother to check, it for me. It felt like it was their first time they were sending sample to the lab or they didn't want to waste their time to make a phone call to learn this for me. No suprise lab cost $580 (got the bill after almost 2 months). Just an annoying inconvenience that having so many stuff to register/make an appointment but nobody cared to check this cost for me in advance.</text>

<review>I’ve been seeing Candy Tong for all of my esthetician needs for about 2 years now. She is an absolute gem and has recently been helping me achieve the skin I want for my upcoming wedding! Derma sweeps, peels and beyond. She is not only extremely talented and knowledge but super personable! I take skin seriously and trust her 100%!< /review>< gmap_id>

<review>I went to Dr. Wolf for a painful chronic medical dermatology problem and was prescribed a drug which worked well.  The  prescription was automatically renewed several times without the need for an appointment.  Without warning, the pharmacy told me that the refill renewal was refused.   I called the office to ask what the problem was, and was told I would have to make an appointment.  The soonest appointment was well past the time that my medication would run out, and my condition flares up almost immediately on stopping the drug.  I asked if I could just have one more refill to hold me until the appointment, but she refused.  This is a cruel treatment of a patient.  It is clear that this place cares more about the lucrative cosmetic side of the practice.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< rating>

<Response>None</Response>< review>
Worst physician experience anywhere in the world. Dr. Morganroth argued incessantly that the PIH on my arms was dermal. Yet, he ended up prescribing treatment (DermaSweep) and medication (Finacea) for epidermal spots despite the fact that it is well published that neither one is clinically indicated for dermal pigmentation. When I questioned his judgement, he became defensive and said he would need to conduct a biopsy. I stated that my spots were the result of injury not disease. Dr. Morganroth implied that I was not telling the truth and arrogantly asked what it was that I did for a living (which was none of his business to begin with). He became visibly upset when I responded that I have a graduate degree and made a career in management in one of the most regulated healthcare industries. While my response shut him up for a while, he continued to act in a misogynistic manner.

It is interesting that at the time of this writing, there is no record from the American Board of Plastic Surgery that Dr. Morganroth has ever been certified as a plastic surgeon. That might explain the reviews reporting serious complications following surgical procedures performed under his care. In November 2017, ironically within days after my appointment, CSI together with Dr. Morganroth and another CSI provider were named defendants in a medical malpractice lawsuit. The hearing is scheduled for early March 2018 at the Santa Clara Courthouse.<//review>

< Review>
Love ecig 101 the people are super helpful and always are down for a conversation which just adds to the inviting element of the store. I do wish they brought in more RDA and RTA’s, maybe some prebuilt coils would be nice but all in all a great shop. Hands down my favorite. Mainly cause of the employees.< /Review>

I was shocked when I first walked into this Vape shop. I was expecting it was like other vape shops that is unorganized and expensive. But it's not. It is a very organized & clean vape shop. They have lots of varieties of juice, from regular juice to Salt Nic Juice. Updated new released vape devices and pods. Friendly customer service! Very welcoming and helpful. I didn't get to take pictures but it's worth the drive to this shop and you'll walk out with a smile.</Text>

<rate>5<//rate><text>Great customer service! Personal service, no pressure sales. Very experienced with the product. Always upfront and honest about all details. I would recommend this place to my children, friends, family, L.E.A. Fire, Medics, Military, they take even better care of you. For your sacrifices and dedication. Mention I sent you and see about a discount.
They have everything you could want or need and if they don't, they will special order. Prices are very competitive but remember your buying local and they have huge overhead. So your not gonna get the cheap 20 box that's probably gonna blow up on on. Your gonna get the real deal with a warranty. With real people who care and will do all they can to help you!

I’ve been coming here since the year they opened and this is still my favorite vape shop in Sonoma County by far. Selection, pricing, and service are usually excellent! I took a star away because they’re constantly running out of stock of my favorite liquid - well over half the times that I attempt to get it, it’s out, and this has been going on for well over a year. I’ve asked a few times if they could please stock more and was told that the amount they stock is based on how much they sell. I don’t understand. If you only order a fixed amount and sell out of that fixed amount *early* over and over, doesn’t it stand to reason that this is a high-demand product, and if you stocked more you’d sell more? They did offer me the option of special ordering it at a premium, but I really just wish they kept more in stock so I wouldn’t have to call ahead each time to see if they have it.</text>

Best place to go if you want good customer service and knowledgeable people about mods, tanks or juice/e-juice.
I've been to a lot of different places I dealt with a lot of different other people and these people I continue to go back to I bought an every one of my mods and tanks and e-juice through them sometimes our prices are a little on the higher side but I would rather pay a little extra money and have the great customer service I get from them otherwise you going to find somebody that calls you by your first name when you walk in the door<//Text>

What I'm getting at is, they don't give you this automatic response or typical help you in help you out type of sales pitch. They let you know what works for what you own so you don't break the expensive mod you e been saving up for. It's just an over all comfortable vibe while in there.< /Review>< Pics>

Staff here is wonderful. They have a computerized system that saves every transaction under your phone number so that you don't have to save your receipt in case of defect. (I wish every store did this.) They also give you points for juice that you purchase which turns into rewards. I no longer live in the area, but I still go every time I have the chance while in Sonoma County. I haven't been elsewhere since I experienced ECIG 101 the first time. You can also try several different flavors for $1-$3 dollars 🙌 Honest salesmen, no pushing when it comes to spending. I even had a guy tell me a comparative lower priced item was better than another. Definitely coming back. Thanks guys!< /Text>

They dont mind taking the time to deal with people like me who are indecisive about juice flavors.and they have a really good selection of flavors to try and buy.

The employees are so helpful and friendly! They let you try several liquids for 99¢ which I appreciate when I want to switch flavors. Pricing is fair for liquids and atomizers are cheap. They have a great selection of high quality liquids.<//Review>

<Review>I just love this vape store!  They have my favorite e juice and mods.  Their selection is amazing and their staff is super friendly and very helpful! I'm always greeted with a smile. The store is clean and attractive with a very nice e juice bar with stools so you can hang out and try all sorts of flavors until you find the ones you like best. They are conveniently located between two Highway 101 exits on a frontage road in Rohnert Park.  Thanks so much e cig 101!!< /Review>< Pictures>

I've been going to E-cig 101 for a few years now and the staff is always warm and welcoming.  They are knowledgeable about their products and a few of the staff have gone above and beyond , but everyone working there is great. One of the staff I recently discovered is no longer working there and although I'll miss visiting with him while picking up my vape oil and supplies I wish him the best in his future ventures- cheers- Joseph</Text>

Great customer service. They really go above and beyond to make sure you leave happy. They make you feel very comfortable and make sure you completely understand how to use the product before you leave. More  businesses should operate like this!!!!</review>

Thank you E-Cig 101! Thank you Julia T for your awesome service and compassion. I appreciate you guys helping us vapors and cbd users get our essential needs. It is essential to have access to everything in your store. That is my opinion. Anyway, thank you all for the delivery!
You are all going over and beyond expectations. Bringing this to a hole new level with delivery. Hope you guys can keep the delivery when this pandemic is over. I imagine it really helps those who are unable to get out and or move around as easy. Stay safe and blessed!
~Ken

They have a great tasting bar And a lot of The Times they do you have your nicotine level in stock. They have a mostly friendly staff and great for beginners starting to vaping but for the heavy vapor head it lacks some stuff.

They do have a discount vape juice section And sometimes you find a good deal Don't worry none of the discount juice has been opened just hasn't sold well.

Great glass great price on it as well

Has a good collection of high tea Blunt wraps / clipper lighters / some rolling trays and alternative glass pieces

They have good mods but rare to see any with evolution DNA chip set also they specialize in mainly atomizer carriage tanks  and a small amount of rebuildables.<//review>

Everyone is friendly and knowledgeable. I knew nothing about vaping when I first walked in, but wanted to quit cigarettes. The warm greeting and aproachable staff keep me coming back. I now have 4 vapes, an assortment of juices and comfortingly switch them. All thanks to the advice and help of the employees. I’ve even gotten my mom to quit smoking by recommending this place. I can’t speak enough about how great this place is. But I’ll stop now or this could go on for days.<//text>

Nice spacious shop. Friendly knowledgeable folks. Young man who first helped me was training so there were a couple of tiny hiccups but vey nice overall. Staff is sharp and enthusiastic. As a complete neophyte I had a lot of questions. All my queries and concerns were answered succinctly. Great selection, and prices are comparable to online+shipping with the obvious advantage of a real business not a virtual, real business experience.  I got 10% off for being locally employed. I signed up for their "ten, get-one-free" type rewards service. Since I work a couple of miles away, this place is very convenient. I will be back again, and again.</text>

I moved to Sacramento and really miss my sweet vape shop!  Awesome staff, great selection of juice and the best spot to get introduced to new mods and flavors.  If you live nearby and are not going here for your vape supplies you are missing out on the best spot I've found and I've checked out shops in San Francisco, San Rafael, Santa Rosa, San Diego, Valencia and Sacramento.

<username>Wes Watson</username><Review>Josh was super helpful getting me started with vaping. Helped me choose a kit, showed me how to set it up and use it like a pro, and then sat me down at the tasting bar to sample juices. Sure is a far cry from the vaping industry of just a few years ago. Knowledgeable and respectable people are what bring me back to a business and I'll be coming back here for sure.<//Review>< Rating>

You can pay to sample 10 diff flavors for 1$ at the bar i believe. They carry a variety of cbd gear, traditional smoke shop glass peices of all types, e-nail set ups of all kinds, and a nice selection of ecigg pens/riggs. Some heady selection spread throughout. Overall nice and knowledgeable staff. Modest to high pricing.< /Review>

I remember when i used to go here a couple years ago it was a cool vape shop now they have different employees that arnt friendly lke the old ones different selections and now they say they cant dicuss prices over the phone that is the type of crap that makes business lose customers< /review>
<pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1521599967443, 'text': "Hi Jeremiah,\nI understand your frustration about us not giving you prices over the phone when you called our store last week. That was an older policy put in place by a former manager, which had recently been changed. There was still some confusion about it, and I have since cleared that up with my team.\n\nI hope you'll give us another chance, there are actually quite a few of us that have been here for several years, and I've been with the company since it opened 5 years ago. I can assure you we are still the same positive and friendly store that we have always been! Please however let me know if there was anything else you felt was lacking in our service, as i appreciate and value all feedback I receive.\n\n-Corinne\nManager"}</resp><gmap_id>0x80844a0614b0411d:0x17b959a6dd3ccc5f<//gmap_id></record>

Rude, expensive, and uneducated on their own products would best describe this awful store. The blonde women that works there is terribly rude(and smells weird too). No matter what they will ID you which is very annoying, even after they all know your face. The worst E-cig store i've ever been too.<//text>

<text>Good basic pizza. Good crust slight crunch with no flop. On the heavy side. Little bit of grease but I’ve seen worse. 22$ for a large pepperoni I feel is about 5-6$ to much.

One of the best pizza shops in town. I order online and it's always coming out of the oven when I arrive. The pizza is always fresh and loaded with toppings. Tried the mozzarella sticks for the first time today and both the sticks and the wedges were delicious. Employees are fast, friendly, and attentive to their customers. A little pricey but worth it for great food.</Text>

First I called three times over the phone thinking I had bad service so I order thru DoorDash for pickup when it was time to pick up my order the guy in the front told me that my order didn’t go thru an then tells me that they are putting my order in with out asking me what I ordered.

<review>Mountain Mike's Pizza is amazing. I got a 20in pizza for only $21 on Tuesday when they have a 40% on any size deal. This pizza is sooo worth the 30 minute drive from Arvin. This is one of my favorite pizza. If was told i  could one have pizza from one pizza place for the rest of my life , i would choose Mountain Mike's Pizza. Yum !!!<//review></record>

Told me my pizza would be ready in 20 min. My pizza took 50 min. To get ready. I asked for 3 extra ranches for a mtn pizza and 18 wings. That would have brought me to 5 total. They had the balls to charge me 3 dollars for them. The manager was right there and just smiled. They didn't say anything about sorry for the wait or anything. Great customer service.</Review>

<review>We had pizza delivered and we were disappointed with the sausage pizza.  It was double sausage but there were two pieces that had no meat.  The others combined for less than 3 pieces on each piece.  I think we'll try someone else.<//review>< Date>

Has great tasting Pizza and awesome potatoes wedges. The lunch rush is always a challenge because their food in the buffet doesn't last long and you do have to wait a few minutes before the new food gets put out. Overall, great pizza place in town.<//review>

<review>I Walked in today to pay for my order. First thing I see is a guy whipping his hands on his shirt. He had multiple Mark's on his shirt from whipping on it.  How hard is it to wash your hands in a sink, just how you are supposed to. DISGUSTING!! I walked out and canceled my order over the phone. I walked in at about 7:20 PM 9/15/19 on a sunday. I will never eat here!< /review>< GmapID>

I ordered a Pizza and when i opened the box it was as if i ordered a olive pizza. Could not see any meat just olives and it was disgusting. I called and manager Patrick was so rude and literly yelled at me and told me he is the Owner and what did i want from him and that he wasnt going to do anything for me and i could call corporate. He was so rude. Never met any one so rude and disrespectful. So yes he really upset me so i literally told him " What he can do with his rude self and no good tasting pizza!!"</text>

Been ordering from this place for years but now their boss won't let them deliver to me anymore.  I live 3.2 miles away from them but they all of a sudden can't be bothered! I ordered a pizza every week from this location and always give a good tip. Well if they don't want my money anymore then screw them. I'll take my business to the brimhall location which is 3.1 miles Away from me but are always nice and never give me any problem. I'm tired of giving my business to a place that doesn't value their long time weekly customers anyway. Their new boss sucks really really bad!</review>

<rating>1<//rating><review>Shame on Mountain Mike's Pizza on Stockdale Highway! My boyfriend has been ordering from them for years. He lives 3.2 miles away and they claim it's too far all of a sudden. For the past few months they've said well you have to order between $25- $45 (depending on who is working). It's just pitiful for an establishment to treat their faithful (and by faithful I mean he orders at least once a week) patrons in such a manner. Shame on whoever is running this place now!< /review>< pictures>

<Text>Pizza here is good, especially the canadian bacon. So what is the problem? Bad Service. The ladies there are really nice but when you call for a pick up order they tell you it is 20 minutes. However actual time was 28 minutes and they do not let you know it is done you have to go back to the counter to ask if its done. At least last time this happened at a competing parlor they made it right and threw in some wings.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<review>Most definitely add bacon as a topping, it's that crunchy, greasy , charred at the tips bacon , its all sizzling when they bring you the pizza  ,and the bacon grease slides onto the cheese for extra flavor.  The ambiance is simple and small , but you can surely come enjoy a game witha a crowd of 6 .</review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Text>Decided to order just before closing time. The person taking my order over the phone said no rush your Pizza will be here when you arrive. As such it was hott and ready for me a few minutes after their official closing  time. Thank you for that great gesture and customer service. It had been about 10 years since I had Mountain Mike's in my old town and since moving to Bakersfield. But with that first bite it brought back all those great memories. And just know its still that great tasting pizza I remember since back when. But I actually feel like such a fool for having settled for less. All those nasty card board tasting pizza's... But never again. Thanks guys and wifey loved it. First time Mountain Mike's experience for her...B♡MB PIZZA...m</Text>< time>

I am a pizza junky. At one point living on the east coast and returning home to retaste the so-called "pizza" this town passes off, I was missing somthing. . . REAL PIZZA! until my fiance and I tried this place. It blew my dang mind how good the sauce was, fresh the cheese and dough were and also how quickly they had it ready. These guys rock!</Review>

The paneria is great, but their food service is dingy and customer service sucks. My husband paid 12 dollars for three tacos. The cashier was rude and the whole facility has no restrooms.< /Text>

<resp>None<//resp><Text>It's taken me 2 weeks to write this review as this grief is something I've never experienced but I feel it in my soul. Saying goodbye to a dear pet is one of the biggest decisions you'll make so I hope this review provides some comfort to those in their search for the perfect vet.

Our beloved 14.5 year old pup DaisyBug was diagnosed with kidney failure back in March & our vet said she had about 4-6 months. I rescued her when she was 6 weeks old while I was living in Italy. She survived being poisoned twice in Italy, the journey back to CA, & was an overall fighter. She was my first dog..the best little girl.

Over the past months I saw Daisy’s health deteriorating. I’d called Dr. Sondra Elson back in June to ask questions about the process & she was so helpful & compassionate, I knew she would be the one when the time came. I’d been cooking for Daisy since her diagnosis, taking her for walks with her sister, but really waiting for her to give me a sign of when she was ready to go.10 days before Christmas, Daisy had a stroke to the point I thought we’d have to find an emergency vet. The panic & fear in her eyes is something I’ll never forget. We gave Daisy an amazing last night & day with us before Dr. Sondra came to our home.

Our hearts absolutely shattered in letting our beautiful girl go, but she lived longer than originally expected & every moment was a blessing. This process is truly an emotionally devastating one, & I’m so thankful to have found Dr. Sondra to help us through the process. She was so caring, giving us all the time we needed to say our goodbyes & hold our girl, & she treated our girl with much love & respect, from the moment she walked in, to the moment she carried her out. The note I received from her after was beautifully written & comforting in the heartbreak I'm still experiencing.

Thank you Dr. Sondra... I'm forever grateful for you transitioning our girl to her peaceful rest.<//Text>< time>

She has helped up as our cat and dog had to make their transitions. We couldn't have gone through the process without her.  She has also been available on the phone when we were in a crisis with another one of own dogs.  I can't say enough positive things about Sondra and Compassionate Heart.  We are so lucky they are here for us all.< /text>< Gmap_id>

<text>I'm so fortunate to have chosen in-home euthanasia for my beloved dog of 16 years. I can't begin to express how thankful I am for Dr. Sondra Elson. She was so sweet to our dog and made this hard process as stress-free as possible. Thank you for the love and care you provide. We appreciate you.</text>< Rating>

We can not say enough good and positive words about this wonderful company and services. As many know, the loss of a pet is sometimes worse than the loss of a family member. Myself, wife and daughter we put at complete ease and comfort with our dear Gwendolyn falling to sleep and resting forever. She lived a great life and had the best care possible by Compassionate Heart and Dr. Sondra. Thank you 100 times over!</Review>

Thank you for explaining everything and every step you took, this was important for us and our children. Thank you for being so caring, gentle and loving throughout. It is still so hard to imagine a life without her. But we know her suffering has ended and she can rest now.</Text><rate>5<//rate>< pictures>

For that moment in time when compassion is the only thing that makes the unbearable goodbye possible, I could not be more grateful for Dr. Sondra. Saying goodbye to our sweet Lucy is still a fresh hurt in our hearts but thanks to Dr. Sondra, our final moments with her were as gentle and quiet as she was. We actually called Dr. Sondra a little over a year ago when Lucy was facing a third surgery for ongoing issues that she could not seem to overcome and were ruining her quality of life. Thanks to her specialist recommendation, she was able to avoid any additional surgeries and we were blessed with another year. Sadly, the time still arrived but I will be forever thankful for that extra year and be at ease knowing her final days and moments were nothing but comfortable and loving. Thank you so much Dr. Sondra for your kindness and care for our sweet Lucy.<//Text>

Dr. Sondra Elson came to my home bringing compassion, professional demeanor, and exceptional skill. She was able to help us all transition as we said goodbye to our beloved Labrador. Her experience was evident as she was able to explain and consider our emotional space. Eternally thankful.< /Review>

Our poor cat's kidney disease flared up and he was not doing well. Over a week, he stopped eating and lost his sight. He was in a lot of pain. We are grateful to have found Compassionate Heart.  The vet who came to our house explained the process beforehand so that it was clear to us. The procedure was pain-free for Snowflake.

The whole process, as heart-wrenching as it was, went smoothly. Compassionate Heart runs a great business and truly cares about helping your pet to leave this world pain-free and comfortable. The cremated remains are kept in a beautiful wooden box that they supplied, and they even made us a clay print from one of his little paws.

I highly recommend this business.<//review>

I cannot say enough good things about Dr Elson and the service she provided. Losing our dog Jeff was an awful experience, but being able to end his suffering at home, at peace, and in the hands of such a caring professional helped us get through the hardest part with a little more grace and comfort than the alternatives. I would 100% recommend Compassionate Heart San Diego for your beloved pet’s needs in their final moments.< /review>

We have used the kind, experienced services of Dr. Elson twice to release our beloved pets from the pain of terminal illness.  We had her come in 2014 and now in 2021. She is, as the business name states, compassionate to the extreme.   She knows that choosing to put a cherished pet to sleep is an agonizing decision, and her gentle approach to both ailing pet and clients is amazing.  Again, we were so impressed with her services that we called her back when it was time to let another pet go to the Rainbow Bridge. We do not hesitate to praise her professionalism, respectfulness and gentleness.</text>

< Review>
Dr. Elson was very kind and detailed when discussing my dog's health and quality of life.  I felt very reassured after my phone consultation that my dog would be in good hands when the time came.  Two months later, my partner and I knew it was time to say goodbye.  We called Dr. Elson and she was available next day at the time we requested.  She arrived and explained the process slowly and calmly, while loving on our dog.  She went step by step and made it the most peaceful experience possible.  Thank you, Dr. Elson! <3</Review>

<text>Dr. Sondra has made this process so peaceful and kind for us. During Covid, she came to our house and used every precaution. She lovingly visited with our animals and helped us put our incredible Bonnie-Dog over the Rainbow Bridge. She's at peace now and it was a good memory for us. We are at peace too because of the process. I'm grateful to Compassionate Heart San Diego and Dr. Sondra for making this a good experience for us :)<//text>< gmap_id>

<review>Dr. Elson was referred by a friend and she has helped counsel us through our final days with two pets over the last few years.

<Text>Tragically, I had to say goodbye to my son Rico. However, the lady that came by to do the euthanasia was very great. It was an emergency situation (several seizures, then a non-stop seizure) and she got there within 2 hours. With COVID meaning we cannot be inside the vet's office when the euthanasia is performed and the difficulty and danger in transporting a seizing dog there anyway, we were glad to have a vet be willing and able to come to our home. Very responsive and did a lot of little things to afford him dignity in the end.</Text>< Response>

<Text>I woke up today feeling so glad we chose Compassionate Heart help us with our 14 year old German Shepherd.  As I look back on yesterday, as painful as it was, there was also a feeling like we gave Roxy the best experience we could.  Roxy was never stressed throughout the entire process.  Choosing the right time to help her cross over the rainbow bridge was so difficult.  But when it was really clear that Roxy was ready, we reached out to Compassionate Heart.  And I am so happy we did.  I knew I wanted someone to come to our home since Roxy was a big girl and it would have been so stressful for her to be taken into a vet's office.  So, I searched online and found Dr. Sondra.  She made the entire experience perfect.   She was so tender and kind with us (as many have said) but it meant so much at the time.  She was so gentle with Roxy as well.  I could go on forever and really can't say enough about how great Dr. Sondra is.

I gave Dr. Sondra 5 stars on every front because she got back to us right away (which another company we called did not ever call us back,) her price was in the range that we had read about and could afford which helped a lot, and was on time which meant a lot too.

I know it was time for Roxy and I have such a sense of peace today looking back on the experience that she was truly cared for in the best way possible.  We will miss her so much but know that her life was perfect from beginning to end.  I will always be grateful for Dr. Sondra and so glad she is able to help many others through the process too.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

When it was time to make that final decision for my best buddy of nearly 18 years, I knew taking him to the Vet would be stressful. So, I called the vet and asked for a recommendation and Sondra with Compassionate Heart was their first choice. Sondra was very professional and very understanding of we were going through. Our dog, didn’t get nervous (not even a little bit). It is susceptible a hard decision to make. When you come to the conclusion that it is time, the easiest decision to make is to call Sondra Elton with Compassionate Heart San Diego!</text>

Sadly, I've had to call upon Dr. Sondra Elson twice.  But I wouldn't do it any other way.  My Roxy and Charlie were surrounded by family, laying in their "usual" spots, to take their last breath.< /review>< userid>

<text>We just recently had to put two of our pups to rest. Sondra Elson, was the DVM that helped us through this process both times. I cannot say enough wonderful things about her. She made one of the hardest things so much more manageable. She is one of the most caring, compassionate humans. I couldn't imagine having anyone else help us through such a heartbreaking time.  She is truly wonderful.</text>< user>

Dr. Sondra is the definition of a compassionate heart. I needed her services at the saddest time in my life, and she handled the passing of my pet with comforting professionalism. She is exceptional at caring for your animal, and your grief. I hope I never need her again, but I highly recommend her for everyone in a similar situation. She was diligent in her consultation, timely in responses, and went above and beyond to find an appointment time that met our needs. There’s no better way to say goodbye than with Dr. Sondra of Compassionate Heart.<//Text>

I called Dr Sondra when it was time for my lovely 17 year old Chihuahua  Lolita to pass. Sondra was very kind and compassionate, came to my apartment and made the unthinkable procedure a blessing.  I had spent every day for 17 years with Lolita and her ashes are now with me in my living room.  Sondra sent me a beautiful card which meant so much. she is a lovely veterinarian. Sandra< /review>

It's taken me almost two weeks to be able to write this post.  I simply cannot put into words how grateful I am to have found Dr. Sondra Elson when I needed to make one the hardest decisions of my life.  My 18 and a half y/o tuxedo cat was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor.  I cared for her until I knew her quality of life was no longer what she deserved.  I called Dr. Elson to set up in home euthanasia and she was so patient with me as I could barely speak through my tears.  She talked to me about the procedure and said she could come out the next day.  She told me when she came for the appointment that ultimately my cat would never even know she was in the room.  I held her while she slept and Dr. Elson slipped in and put her to rest.  It was peaceful and she was at rest within 5 minutes of her coming in.  She passed in her own home in my arms where she's spent the last 18.5 years.  I couldn't have asked more.  Dr. Elson is a saint in my books.  Bless her for helping families when they distraught and in need of a truly compassionate heart.  Thank you Dr. Elson for everything you did for my Lilo.</text>

She understood that I was undertaking the final, most difficult, heart-wrenching act of love for my boy and she helped him so gently. She did this under very difficult circumstances that others would not have faced.  I am humbly and forever grateful to her.</Review>< Response>

Dr. Sondra was so kind and compassionate with our 15 year old fur babies. We had 2 Shiba Inu''s and had decided that Kanuck had suffered enough with his arthritis and dementia. It was a painful decision but the doctor made it so much easier.  She came on last Sunday and helped him transition very peacefully. I was grateful to be able to hold him as he drifted away.  His brother Kody (also 15) watched and I wondered how long he would be here, knowing they were inseparable. The next night somehow he fell down stairs and was in a lot of pain and wouldn't move. I tried contacting vets, but we couldn't get him in to see anyone. By the morning we knew what had to happen. It was devastating. Dr. Sondra came out that day and when she walked in she was crying too, it was only 2 days since she was here.
I can't say enough about this beautiful soul who helps so many at a time that is so sad.  She is truly represents the meaning of "Compassionate Heart"</Text>

Dr. Sondra is an angel.

Our dear Francesca was 16 1/2, and both my husband's and my first dog. My husband adopted Francesca when she was 3 months old. A few months earlier this year, we thought it was Francesca's time, so we called around to a few different at-home euthanasia vets. Dr. Sondra was the only one who advised us about when to know when Francesca would be ready, and suggested she didn't even need to come out to do an assessment/consultation, based on what we had told her about Francesca at the time on the phone. She was so kind and we really felt that she wasn't in it just to make money.

She kept our information on file and when we did finally call her, she was so caring and empathetic. She took care of everything and was reassuring, when she saw Francesca that Saturday morning, that it was the right time. She explained everything to us, answered our questions, and was so gentle and caring, giving us time to be with Francesca as she transitioned. Considering the situation, that our wonderful friend and companion, Francesca, was passing, the whole experience went better than we could have hoped, and we have Dr. Sondra to thank for that. We HIGHLY recommend her and her services. She is definitely worth her weight in gold.

Thank you Dr. Sondra.< /text>

<Text>My dog Guinness recently had passed just about An hour before my appointment with Dr Sondra. She came nonetheless to help me through the heart wrenching process of letting my beloved big pup go. I was sobbing like a mess and she was kind and absolutely professional.

I wish no one ever had to go through the process but if I have to do it again, I will be calling Dr Elson and highly recommend her any day.

Until then please hug you pup at home.<//Text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

Dr. Sondra Elson was so kind and empathetic. She came prepared with all medical equipment to my home. She took time for myself and my girl to say goodbye in a peaceful, familiar situation. No hospital setting to scare her in her final moment. She was home with family. I recommend this process over traditional hospital setting. This particular Doctor was amazing. I also highly recommend her services. Dr. Sondra Elson really was awesome. I thank you.< /Text>

<text>Dr. Sondra Elson gave our boy Murphy dignified, compassionate, gentle and serene transition. She explained the procedure & let us know what she was doing at every step.  Dr. Elson also explained reactions we might see and to not be alarmed, Murphy would not actually be experiencing any pain or stress. All of her actions and words gave us a sense of calm. Also allowing us to know we had made the right decision for our boy.
She gave an injection to sedate him and tested him several times before she moved on with the procedure.  His passing was so peaceful.  While heartbroken, I am so thankful my boy is no longer in pain.
I highly recommend home euthanasia and definitely recommend Dr. Sondra Elson.</text>< Pics>

<review>our beloved warrior Della was supported by Dr. Elson. As a  consultation call she counseled us on options and felt Della was not at a critical point yet. She lived up to the Compassionate Heart name by referring us to a hospice vet, requesting background health files from previous emergency vet and recommending meds. All this assistance when our Della wasn't in need of her euthanasia services as yet. I appreciate her call backs and advice. It was comforting and helpful. I highly recommend her and am so very thankful for her encouragement.<//review>< UserId.>

Dr. Sondra Elson was/is the best!  It's a bit weird to write a glowing review about something so sad, but I think that's testimony to how good of a service this is for a very difficult time.  From the beginning, Dr. Sondra was professional and responsive, responding to my email request for information within hours and with sincere empathy.  She was available on short notice and punctual for our appointment sending a lovely card a short while after the service and even checking in with a follow-up call to make sure we were doing well.  We loved Benji very much and I think I did right for one of my best friends by choosing Compassionate Heart for this tough decision.  Thank you, Dr. Sondra!</Text>

The service provided could have not been any better. From the initial telephone conversation Dr. Elson asked all the pertinent questions with the intent of being as informative as possible to the time she arrived to the appointment where she explained in detail the procedure and then carried it out with complete professionalism and care.< /Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>It took me awhile to post this because we still miss our cat Ashley.  Dr. Elson couldn't have been more compassionate and responsive in our time of need.  Our poor cat was struggling at the end of her beautiful life and we had no one to turn to.  All other vets would put our cat down but we couldn't be in the room due to COVID-19.  Our cat hated the vet more than anything and would pee herself anytime she had to go.  I refused to have a loving member of our family go through that kind of torture at the end.  Dr. Elson came out to our house, was very careful following all guidelines due to COVID, and took care of us and our furry friend in our time of need.  Our Ashley was laid to rest on July 10th, 2020 and we can't thank Dr. Elson enough.  Ashley went very peacefully and wasn't stressed at all.  I was able to hold her and keep her company until the very end.  It was the only way she should go after being a part of our family for 17 years.  Thank you so much Dr. Elson for your compassion.  We were at our wits end and you saved the day.  This was one of the hardest moments of our lives and it was made better thanks to you.  Dr. Elson even sent us a sympathy card and that meant a lot! I recommend your services to the moon and back.  I can't thank you enough.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80dc01c113f9010d:0x27f979873ce86c4e</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Thank goodness for Sondra and her help. She helped us treat Pearls as she aged and was there for us to decide when it was time. The Family was all together and when it was time Pearl never felt anxiety or  discomfort and in fact felt affection, support and mostly love. Pearl transitioned the best possible way, so we are all very thankful for Sondra;s help.</text>< date>

Dr. Sondra Elson is an angel.  Our family had to say goodbye to our beloved Bevo and she made that experience the best it could be.  I am so grateful that it was Compassionate Heart that my husband called.  This woman is definitely in the right occupation. Thank you Sondra for helping us in the very emotional time!<//text>

Saying goodbye to a furry baby is the hardest decision. It hurts regardless, but having Dr. Elson at our home was the most peaceful way to say goodbye to our beloved 13.5 year old Lab. Dr. Elson is professional, she does her job while you comfort your pet. I would recommend Dr. Elson again in a heartbeat. We appreciate her kindness and respect in a moment of grief.< /text>

<text>Sondra was incredible.
Losing my Jake was one of the hardest things I’ve ever gone through. (As it is for all of us). The few weeks prior were so difficult and the list of decisions I had to make were so overwhelming.  I had found an at home service early on in the process and then at the last minute, when it was really time, they were unavailable.  I was so nervous about having to find someone else last minute.  I was afraid it would exacerbate all of the discomfort and heartbreak I was experiencing.
Well, it was the perfect time to be reminded that things go the way they are supposed to.  I found Sondra and she was so great.  Her communication prior was honest and helpful. She was flexible with me about the timing because his situation changed last minute.  And when she arrived, I was immediately soothed by her presence.  My family spoke for weeks after about how awesome she was.
She has the most incredible balance. She is calming with her clear language and tone and yet has a still and compassionate energy that  gives you and your family the space to fully experience your emotions.   She was gentle yet demonstrated method and confidence in the procedure she was performing. Her presence was fully supportive without any over dramatizing, which I very much appreciate.
After he passed, my family went outside and I stayed to finish the process with her.  I was happier with just her and I in the room than I would have been with even my loved ones at that time.  At one point, she even made me belly laugh.  Not on purpose, and by no means in an insensitive way, but just by being her.  I know most wouldn’t think of this as a time to laugh.  But my family later told me that when they heard me laugh from outside, they finally took a breath and felt a sigh of relief.  It was for sure a gift to me.  I have so much deep appreciation for who she is and that she was the one there for me and us in that very difficult moment.  I will forever choose at home euthanasia for any pet I own, and I hope I will still be able to find her when that time comes.<//text>< response>

<review>The vet who helped us with my little dog “Cricket” had moved on and so although I couldn’t use her I was certain that I was never going into the vets office to do this again.
I looked meticulously through websites and after through review I found Sondra.
Sondra was so sweet and friendly, she explained everything before we decided to move forward.
It is never an easy decision to put your senior dog to sleep but if you find yourself at this crossroad I wholeheartedly recommend Sondra.
She even mailed me a thoughtful card about Thor. She really cares about our doggies and their transition.
Thank you Sondra. Your thoughtfulness is appreciated and I thank you for helping us.</review></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Sondra Elson - what a wonderful angel this lady is. We had to say goodbye to our beautiful cat Stevie (18.5 years). It seemed so hard to even consider the step, let alone make the call, set up an appointment, and then see or be present as the activity happened. It was the right thing for Stevie at this time but, this fact did not make it even one iota easier for my wife and I. To say we were stressed out and "nervous" is woefully understated.
But, from the moment of Sondra's arrival until she pulled out of our driveway will be an enduring memory for us and, as sad a day as it was, the memory of that day will not be a bad one for us. She handled Stevie with such gentleness and care. She handled my wife and I with even more gentleness and compassion. When someone says to me, "bedside manner", this is the standard of excellence I'll measure everything against, human or pet. Well done Sondra....and thank you from the bottom of our hearts.</text>

I did not want Lola's last moments to be in terror and discomfort at the vet's office, and I did not want my last memories of her to be there--to take her to the vet and leave without her was unthinkable. Dr. Sondra made the entire process as painless and easy as it could be under the circumstances. She was calm and compassionate, did not rush me, and treated Lola with respect and care.

< Review>
It's taken me a few months to be able to write this, but Sondra came to my home on short notice on a Friday night last December when my sweet kitty was fading quickly.

She actually had a seizure within minutes of Sondra's arrival and she was able to act swiftly to give her an injection that allowed her to relax immediately. She went right to work to ensure her passing was painless. She was kind and gentle, and so considerate of my feelings. Careful to explain what she was doing, not rushing me in any way. She patiently allowed me to be as involved as I desired, let the other animals in my home take their time with her, and let me take my time saying goodbye.

This was one of the hardest scenarios I've faced, but being able to do so at home, rather than the cold, institutional setting of a vet office was worth it all. I know that this is the route I will take in the future for my pets, so that they can be comfortable, instead of stressed, when it's time for them to cross the rainbow bridge.< /Review>

Sondra helped us put our 13 year old lab down- ( but really our first born child) Our dog was so special to us and we really wanted to honor his life. Sondra held space for us as Kane passed over. We buried him at our home after she left. Her service is worth every penny. I’m so grateful for her and the divine work she does here on earth. She is truly an angel. Thank you Sondra!!!< /text>

Dr. Elson is amazing. We recently had to make a difficult decision to say goodbye to two of our family dogs. Our chihuahua was 21 and our Boxer was suffering from Cancer at the age of 12. They both crossed over during the same home visit and Dr. E made this process so peaceful and respectful. I could not imagine saying goodbye to your pet any other way. They were in the comfort of our home, relaxing on their favorite beds and blankets. She is a saint for offerring this in-home service to pet parents.</text>

My beloved dog had to be euthanized on a Sunday. My vet that I had used previously for 2 of my furry babies was not open for Sunday in home euthanasia. I found several places online and left messages. Dr. Sondra from Compassionate Heart San Diego was the only one that called me back and I am so glad that she did. In my heart I knew that it was time for him to go over the Rainbow Bridge but I was having such a hard time with my decision and she helped to ease my fears and extreme sadness. She was very compassionate to my situation and my furry baby was so relaxed and peaceful through the whole experience that I knew he was finally at peace and out of pain. I will most certainly use Dr. Sondra again when the unfortunate time arises with my remaining furry babies.</Text>

<Text>We used this service two years ago, and were so satisfied with Dr. Sondra's professionalism and compassion, we naturally decided to go with her again this morning when our beloved Schnauzer Wrigley needed attention. Such a heartbreaking time, and Dr. Sondra just gets it.

<Review>Dr. Sondra is an angel. A very special kind of veterinarian who is genuine, empathetic, and so very kind. How do you decide when to let go of your closest companion and love of your life? Dr. Sondra took the time to help me understand what was best for my dog and how to know when it was time. When I called her six months later, she was there for us in the most gentle, caring way. The whole process being at home made the ordeal into a loving and respectful passing. I was left with a pawprint from Lotus which was given to us at the end. Dr. Sondra was SO GENEROUS with her time, her patience, and her calming presence. I'm forever grateful and will never forget her. On one of the most difficult days of my life, she was a blessing.< /Review><username>Elizabeth Gersten< /username>< time>

Our 20+ year old kitty Abby was at the point where we needed to say goodbye to her. I had read the info on the Compassionate Heart website, so I called and spoke to Dr. Sondra Elson. She came to our home and was professional, compassionate and an absolute angel. She took the time to talk us through what would be happening, all the while petting our beautiful girl as if it was her own pet. We were able to say our goodbyes to Abby and have her leave this life surrounded by her family who loved her dearly. I swear she had a slight smile on her little face thanking us for giving her the dignified, compassionate and loving farewell she so deserved. We are forever grateful that Sondra helped us ease Abby onto her new journey.<//review>

The service was good, they were fast, the food was fresh and hot, but I hate chooosing an establishment and then after you are stuck in the line and cannot get out, you find out they are out of why you choose them In the first place. For this reason, I gave 3 stars. The manager needs to have enough supplies.< /text>

Dr. Elson thought of every possible detail to make a sad occasion as  stress-free as possible for both me and my cat -- everything from letting the cat have some independence in her last minutes (being able to walk around on her own after the injection as opposed to being held down) to the lovely, cozy basket she took her away in. I've had many pets put down in my life, and it's always painful. But I can't speak highly enough of this angel of mercy.</text>

<review>It was really hard to take the decision of helping my little Gina to cross the rainbow bridge. She hated to be in a carrier inside my car so much that she would urinate a lot every single time I had to take her to the vet's office. It was killing me to think that I would have to stress her so much by putting her in the carrier, then in the car to drive her to a vet clinic to put her to sleep. That was not the peaceful final moments I wanted for my little angel.
After researching a little bit I finally found Dr. Elson and, even though I was not happy, I was relieved to think that at least my cat would be at home with all of her family who love her so very much.
Dr. Sondra Elson was amazing! Very attentive since the very first email I sent her. She answered all the questions I had promptly. She came to our home in a rainy Saturday morning. She was very gentle and loving with my baby cat. My husband, sister and I were beside Gina the whole time as every day since we adopted her over 10 years ago. She went to sleep in our living room while being held by my sister, and then, while comfortably laying on towels that were carefully folded by Dr. Elson and placed on our rug, she passed. Dr. Elson did not rush anything, and even after Gina was gone, she wrapped her very gently and respectfully in a pink baby blanket and placed her in a nice basket before taking her away (because we opted for cremation and later we received her ashes back.)
Dr. Elson, it is hard to put into words how grateful we are for what you've done for us and our Gina. It is a very hard and emotional decision, but it really was our only option since Gina could no longer fight the horrible cancer she had on her chin and was no longer able to eat without pain. Therefore, I could not imagine a better way, place and person for Gina to be with on her last moments. And with all of us, her FAMILY, in the comfort of her HOME!
Thank you so much from the bottom of our hearts!
I'm sorry for the very long review, but I found a little comforting and reassuring to read the stories shared by others when it was time to take this decision.<//review></record>

I called Sondra Elson, DVM when I became aware that I would need help with the end of life for my dear, sweet dog Simon. Simon was my life companion that I loved so much, & I wanted a painless, peaceful passing for him. Sondra was very patient in talking with me, & when the end was evident, she came to my home & sat with us, taking all the time that was needed. She was very cautious in assuring he was pain free before going forward. She was also attentive to my mindset & emotions prior to proceeding. While nothing can take away the devastating sorrow I feel in his absence, Dr Elson could not have been more compassionate in helping him pass. She phoned later to check on me, & sent a lovely note in a card. She truly represents the namesake of Compassionate Heart.< /review>

This is long overdue.  As you know it is extremely painful to euthanize a furry family member you love.  I talked to Sondra from Compassionate Heart and she wanted to make sure I was ready to go through with it.  She talked to me for about 15 minutes before setting up a time to meet at my house.  When she was here we talked another 15 minutes more.  Knowing it was time, she walked me through the process and explained every possible scenario.  Not only was Sondra professional, she was compassionate, sympathetic and empathetic.  I cannot speak highly enough about Sondra and the way she made it as bearable as the situation could be.  My baby was peaceful and relaxed as he crossed over.  Of course it was extremely painful for me, knowing my baby was at peace made it that much easier.  Thank you Dr. Sondra Elson, To make one of the worse days of my life a little bearable.  I cannot imagine any other way.< /text>

Dr. Sondra Elson was amazing. She came to our house the day after I called her and helped us say goodbye to our beloved yellow lab. She was kind and caring and explained each step of the process. She gave us as much time as we needed to say our final goodbye's and kisses and it was a very peaceful process for our dog. She made a very hard process easier and I am grateful to her for her help. I highly recommend her to anyone looking for home euthanasia. Our dog hated the vet and always shook like a leaf when we were there so we decided to do it at home and our dog died on her favorite bed while I was holding her precious little face and scratching her ears which she loved. Thank you Dr. Elson< /text>

<Review>Dr. Elson's compassion and expertise made the extremely difficult act of letting go of my 16 year old companion be the best it could be. I know my little guy didn't suffer at all. She gave me the time and space to say goodbye at every point in the process (which she explained in great detail). She was attentive to both of us. I highly recommend Compassionate Heart during the difficult time of putting down your beloved pet.< /Review><user_name>Lisa Lehr<//user_name><time>1508607477080<//time>< Resp>

Sondra is incredible. In November of 2018 we found out our poor 8 year old Radley had a heart base mass. We were told we wouldn’t have much more time with him, but we were fortunate enough to get 2 more months with him. He started to decline quickly last Saturday and after a friend referred us to Sondra, we called and she was able to come out that Sunday afternoon to put our sweet Radley down. She was very informative and showed her compassion for animals and professionalism.<//Review>

Sondra Elson is the most compassionate person, I have ever met. She has been with me for the loss of two of my furry babies. She is quick to respond, she is gentle, she is patient, she is understanding and she doesn't rush. And she will leave you with your baby's paw print. I highly recommend Compassionate Heart.</Text>

There are not enough positive words in my vocabulary to describe Dr Sondra. I could go on and on and not convey how wonderful this woman is. And, how grateful I am for her. Not once, but twice she has come to our home on extremely short notice to ease our dogs passings. The most recent, my beautiful, faithful lab had a horrible incident which left him incopasitated, dizzy and in pain. I know she’s a very busy vet but she made it to our home in a matter of a few hours. She clearly was concerned that our dog was suffering. She was professional, compassionate and friendly. I also can’t believe how reasonable she is. She has so much work to do later that we don’t see. She performs a difficult task with upset people. She’s an< /Text>

<pictures>None<//pictures><user_name>Justin Betyar<//user_name><Resp>None</Resp><Text>Recently our husky Atticus who was nearing 15 years old was slowing down and his health was diminishing quickly.  We as a family had to make the difficult decision to help end his suffering, but knew that taking him to our vet (who is great) in a place he has feared all of his life, was not something that we were willing to do.  We came across Compassionate Heart and Dr. Sondra Elson ("Dr. E") and let her know his health status and why we were reaching out.  As one would hope, she asked for some background information regarding his health to make sure he was a candidate for euthanasia and that we were not acting in conflict with his best interests.

After discussing, we scheduled a time for her to come over and she met us at the house.  She was extremely calm, professional, and most importantly caring with Atticus.  She explained the process to us so we would be aware of possible occurrences as she administered the necessary medications.  Once we started the process, we found out Atticus was barely hanging on as a simple pain killer / sedative was enough to ease his suffering and allow him to pass peacefully.
Furthermore, Dr. E was amazing with Atticus the entire time as she was incredibly gentle with him and provided the necessary assurance that he was in good hands.   This experience couldn't have gone better and we are incredibly thankful she was able to assist in our time of need.  I'd highly recommend using Dr. E if needed and I know if we need to do this again with any of our other pets, she is the first person I would call.< /Text><Time>1569353378412<//Time>< userid>

Tonight, Dr Elson came to lay my sweet baby Yoda to sleep. I can’t  imagine any other way. Because of her, Yoda passed in my arms on his favorite blanket in the comfort of my own home. I can never thank you enough. My heart is broken but bc of you, it was a little bit easier. Thank you for making it as peaceful as possible.< /review>

I had to say goodbye and “until we meet again” to our 13 year old Boston Terrier named Roxi. Dr. Sondra came to our house to help our girl go over the Rainbow Bridge and be with God. She was extremely patient, loving, respectful, and compassionate. I give her 5 stars, only because there isn’t a selection for a million hearts of gratitude.</Text>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Review>Sasha was diagnosed with lymphoma in February.  Shortly after, I contacted Sondra who spent at least 45 minutes with me on the phone.  During the course of Sasha losing her battle with cancer, I remained in contact with Sondra and she was always very kind and supportive. I even sent her a video of how Sasha was doing. As Sasha's time came closer I reluctantly scheduled a time for Sondra to come out - Monday May 16th. But the night before our girl was outside, circling the hot tub chasing a mouse. Her breathing had been shallow & her appetite had tapered off, but she still had so much energy. We couldn't do it, we weren't ready. I called Sondra and informed her of our decision to cancel.  She never pressured us at any point during this difficult time. Monday came, I went to work but had received a call from my wife that Sasha was not doing well. Before leaving work I called Sondra and told her about Sasha taking a turn for the worse.  She asked if 7:30 at night would work and I agreed. I left work early, came home and noticed our girl was not well at all, a sudden & drastic decline from the previous night. So once home around noon, I called again and asked if she could come sooner.  Sondra was at  North County home within 2 hrs from my call. I lied on the floor next to my dog until she arrived. She came in and immediately sat on the floor next to me & my dog. She comforted Sasha while she spoke to us. Kind, caring. This is not a job for Sondra, this is her passion. She truly cares, she gets it, she understands. I couldn't have asked for a more peaceful passing. I cried, a lot - but couldn't have asked for a better person to be there with us.  I requested she bring an ink pad for a tattoo I want of her paw print, she also provides a nice clay impression. My only regret is not giving Sondra more of a hug - that was only to keep me from crying more.  It was a hard decision to make, it sucks, it's sad. Although knowing this & how I feel, I know we will get another dog someday. I love them too much not to have one. Thank you Sondra

Update - after several years have passed, I maintain contact with Sondra. She is more than just a experienced vet, she is a friend - she is someone that will be there for you no matter her personal situation and stressors. She truely cares<//Review>< gmap_id>

Our 15 year old Kimahri was rapidly deteriorating within a 2 week span. We received some sad news that Kimahri had a handful of health issues, some which could be treated but since he was 15 and couldn't see or walk very well we made the hard decision to say goodbye.
Dr. Sondra Elson came to our house on a Friday night to help us send Kimahri over the rainbow bridge. She was very compassionate, explained the whole process and did not rush us. The process went better than we could have hoped for. We highly recommend her services if you live in the San Diego area.<//Text>

<text>We've had the unfortunate need to use Dr. Elson's services twice in a 2 year time span.   We already decided an at-home service is what we wanted for our cats, but did not expect the compassion, support, and love we received through the entire process from Dr. Elson.  We could not have asked for a better way to help our fur babies pass over to the other side.<//text><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

Dr. Elson, DVM, helped make a very painful, difficult decision and process significantly less difficult.  I have already made one referral to her and will personally use her services again in the future.

Thankfully, we still have our girl with us. We opted for surgery, which could’ve been very tricky on a 14+ year old dog. She pulled through with flying colors after having a 1.5 lb tumor removed from her side. When the time does come, we will call on Dr. Elson.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>We had to finally let our beloved pitbull mix, Gurl, go recently. Dr Sondra Elson made the experience as easy as I imagine it can go for those of us who love our animals like our own children. Gurl was a 10 year old female dog with degenerative myelopathy (full paralysis in the rear, but fully mentally aware and young at heart) which made it very difficult to say goodbye. Gurl had classic fear of going to veterinary offices, and would tremble with fear whenever in them. We didn't want her last moments to be stressful and fearful. We wanted her happy and comfortable at home with us and her other dog family members. She was calm, quiet, respectful, compassionate and just all around wonderful. The process was unnoticed by Gurl. She would pass on comfortable in her bed right after eating a huge steak, chocolate chip cookies and vanilla ice cream while surrounded by her loving family. After sedation, she laid her head down and she fell asleep in our arms, exactly where she always wanted to be, and passed away peacefully. My family is so grateful that there are professionals like Sandra Elson around that offer in home euthanasia services. 5/5 Stars.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80dc01c113f9010d:0x27f979873ce86c4e</Gmap_id>< username>

The week before Thanksgiving we had to make the very difficult decision to say goodbye to our good boy, Dino.  We named him after the dog in the cartoon family The Flinstones because our kids were all about dinosaurs when he came to live with our family.  We have 15 years of happy memories with him.  We talked to Dr. Sondra Elson on the phone in the morning, spent hours agonizing over our decision, and finally in the afternoon we knew that we had to do this for him.  Dr. Elson came to our home that evening, with such short notice.  She walked into the room with a calmness, and soft voice, that made us all feel comfortable.  She was very sensitive and kind, and explained every part of the process.  When Dino was at peace, she handled him carefully.  We had decided we wanted to have him cremated, so she took him with her, and within a few days we brought his ashes home.  We would highly recommend Dr. Elson to anyone who has to make that difficult decision to say goodbye.<//review>

<Text>This is by far the most difficult review that I have ever had to write.  However, I feel that Dr. Elson deserves an amazing review because she herself is so amazing and the service she provides is unparalleled.  My best friend Benji got leukemia and I had to make a very difficult decision to end his life.  I wanted to make it as easy on him as possible so I called two at home euthanasia companies and Dr. Elson responded very quickly.  Sondra was so empathetic and compassionate when I was truly a wreck.  She treated Benji with such respect and she was so tender before and after, even swaddling him to carry to the car.  She made one of the worst moments of my life bearable.  A week later she called to check on me and even sent the kindest condolence card.  If I am to find a blessing in this whole situation it is that Sondra was the one who came and helped me say goodbye to my dog Benji.  If you are put in this difficult position I would not hesitate to call Dr. Elson, she was truly a Godsend.< /Text>< pics>

I cannot express enough how amazing Dr. Sondra Elson is. Putting my sweet 15 yr old pit/lab mix was one of the hardest things I have ever done. He was our family, and Dr. Elson treated him as such.
She was gentle, calming, so very compassionate and informative. My dog was able to pass away in my lap, with me petting him the whole time. He never felt a thing, just peacefully let go.
She was so gentle and sweet tucking him under a blanket afterwards. This was the absolute best way to say goodbye- I am so thankful we found her!! Knowing my dog passed so very peacefully gives me comfort.
This is the person you want for your beloved pet during such a difficult time, without a doubt.
Thank you Dr. Sondra Elson for all that you do!!!< /text>

She made us all comfortable with what  she was going to do by explaining every step and the reactions Danny would have to them.  She was professional and yet compassionate. My last memories of Danny was his head on his front paws asleep.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Obviously, if you find yourself in need of these services, you are already going through an agonizing process. We had hoped and prayed that our boy Max would meet his end with us naturally, as he absolutely hated being transported. The thought of his last hours being spent in anxiety as we forced him into his cat carrier, then took him on a long car ride, into a waiting room with unfamiliar smells and sounds from strangers and other animals was more than we could bear. Thankfully, Dr Sondra Elson with Compassionate Heart does what she does. No matter what, it was going to be a sad time, but thanks to Dr Elson, he was able to go in the comfort of his home, surrounded by his family and in absolutely no pain. Dr Elson made the process simple and peaceful, took care of all of the logistics, and truly set us at ease. If you're reading this and debating on using Dr Elson's services, know that there is absolutely no way you could do better. I'm sorry you're facing what we just had to go through, but Dr Elson is the one you want to help your family find peace.<//review>

My work schedule recently changed and I go to the gym right after I get off but it’s so frustrating because it’s always at capacity and you have to wait a little. I used to love coming to this gym but now it’s a hassle. Probably going to have to just cancel membership till my work schedule changes again or the gym expands.. hopefully the latter because I know a lot of other people are also affected by the small capacity.</Text>

<text>Tom is an experienced trainer who develops great workout sessions for me and requests feedback so he can modify the routines if necessary.  The gym is clean with a friendly, professional staff.  Parking is excellent compared to most gyms.  Equipment is clean and well maintained.  It's very easy to recommend the gym to anyone.   Nice mix of young and older clients who all seem to be having a good time.  Grady, the manager, gets a lot of credit for the atmosphere.</text>< pictures>

They check your temp at sign in, recommend masks while working out ( and as far as my time there everyone does),  sanitizer and paper towels to clean equipment before and after using( and every one does), staff members also cleaning . No locker rooms ( they have 2 changing rooms, and lockers along the walls). The price is great! I mean really really great!  Staff is friendly , and remember your name! Can say anything bad about this place .<//Review>< rate>

Cheap, generally clean, friendly staff, etc. It can get a little bit too busy to do much sometimes, due to the relatively small space, but they can't really do much about that, given the location. Not so much a strike against the staff as merely something to bear in mind. The remodel has been a welcome change and influenced my return here as a member. Simple, cheap, and well laid out, with some downsides related to a relatively small space. Overall would recommend.</review>< pics>

There are pros and cons for this gym. I have a membership for three years for around $9 per month, so it isn't a bad price. This also includes another person coming with me for free every time, and there are no other fees that I need to pay. It was also easy for me to signup and I could pay the entire amount up-front, unlike similarly priced gyms.

Along with the pros above, there are cons: this place tends to lack cleaning supplies, so I've had to begin bringing my own with me every time now. The bathrooms are also filthy, but I've just come to accept that it's a common occurrence at most gyms nowadays--especially in California. Half the time, nobody is at the front desk, so people sneak in a lot. I've seen it happen three times already, and was stunned that they weren't seen. It also can sometimes be extremely hot and stuffy downstairs, so it'd be nice if they invested in some large, industrial fans for the rooms. One last thing that may not matter to others as much as it does to me: this place closes way too early and opens way too late on weekends. I like to get my workouts done throughout the week and the weekends, and I'm usually working late on studies into the night. I wish they opened at 5 A.M. on weekends like they do during the weekdays.< /Text>

Don't go here or at least don't purchase training sessions. Paid 300$ to get a personal trainer and all they did was cancel on me. And now they're dragging their feet In giving me back my refund. The manager Grady is the biggest joke.< /Text>

Nice club, at first when I started they had some front desk personnel that didn't smile or speak when checking in. I mentioned this to one of the managers and ever since, they have employed new blood that greets and acknowledges your presents. Good job Fitness 19!< /text>

<review>The gym is OK, kind of small. But the reason I’m giving it three stars is because how ridiculous it is to cancel your membership if you ever need to</review>< username>

I really enjoy this gym and most of its staff. It's my teams go to gym. However, I had some billing issues and questions that took over 3 months to fix. Some associates passed me along to others because of little knowledge. Finally when I spoke with the manager I took his attitude personal. I felt like I was being spoken to in a condescending manner along with not really caring about the situation. He made me feel like the issue was my fault. Fortunately I'll continue to attend this gym but I'll be sure to steer clear of the manager.</review>

The gym is cool but I had a negative experience today at 9:00 am at the Zumba's class.
I got into the room just to watch the class because I was curious about the dance class, more than curious I really had the intention in do that and see if I will be able to fallow the class. At that moment... when I got into the room the teacher stopped the class  and told me to leave. She was very rude, completely unpolite and unprofessional with me.

For this reason I don’t want to do this class anymore and I will keep on with my basic plan!</Text>

Amazingly inexpensive day passes, which I love since I'm only in SF on vacation, visiting family. Pretty well equipped for lifting, though it's been very crowded when I've gone, so I usually have to wait 5-10 minutes for a squat or power rack.<//text>

1) Price seems fair for what this gym offers

Cons:
1) Employees are rude, they will call/text you incessantly with marketing and payment requests.
2) Cancelling is a hassle and they'll keep texting you trying to get you to come back for months.

I would not recommend this gym to a friend.< /text><Name>Ian Andersen< /Name></record></dataset><record>

<text>DO NOT GO HERE!!!!  Terrible experience with this place. They do not explain anything about your membership. once you sign up they will just take money from you and does not explain anything else.  And when you cancel it, be surprised on what kind of ridiculous charges you'll get. I was informed that I can cancel my membership any time "no problem" but guess what, they're giving me problems right now. They will and trust me they will charge you for something that you wont be using. They charge me and took my membership ID.  Hate this place!!!</text>< pics>

This is my new favorite contractor for my home improvement needs! My AC was on its last leg! Jaime was very professional and explained how to help make me comfortable in my home at a reasonable cost. They installed a new AC unit and duct work.
Thank you so much for your help and fantastic work!!!<//review>

<Text>We had an outstanding experience with this company. We had a new roof, new gutters with guards and dry rot repair done on our home.  From start to finish the representatives were professional, knowledgeable of their products and services that they offer and quality work completed. John did the initial inspection was very knowledgeable and friendly, Pablo came out to go over the inspection and to go over the roofing and materials required and all the different options, as well as the financing he was professional, friendly and made the process very easy from start to finish. The crew who did all the work were also knowledgeable, friendly and reliable. We are very happy with this company would highly recommend them if you are looking to do improvements to your home.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

We had our roof replaced & updated our electrical panel box. The work was well done (that’s the reason for the stars, for everything else, I would give maybe 1 star)
The communication (or lack of) from the company to the homeowner was Terrible! (Even after we told them we where not happy with the lack of communication, nothing changed) We Had people just show up with no warning (even on a Sunday!) or not that the schedule times, we asked for a break down of costs/material list several times and never received one, even after we where told we would. was quoted a price for a whole house water softener & the price kept changing (we understood one price change, because of some pipe conditions)
But, the price of the unit & labor?  I was never so glad to have everything done and not deal with them anymore.  We would not recommend this company!<//review>

This company is awesome! They went above and beyond to find out the source of our plumbing problem. Everyone from the construction crew, inspectors, customer service and financial services were ready to assist us with anything that came up unexpectedly. It actually made the whole process of major repairs much easier to handle.<//text>

Our home was built in 1923. Over the years it's had many owners and was maintained fairly well but not consistently. My hubby and I bought the home three years ago. We had big dreams of doing renovations and over the covid -19 quarantine decided to take advantage of the time at home. We were stuck there anyway and it made a lot of sense. However, once we got to the exterior after the siding was done we realized how poorly our roof reflected the amount of money and time we put into the home. Around the time we finished our siding, we received a letter from American Home Energy Savers referring to some of the rebates available for energy efficiency upgrades which included roof replacement and HVAC upgrades. Our roof was old and definitely needed to be replaced in contrast to the new siding. It looked terrible. We called and booked an appointment with a technician. Steve, our technician took us through the process of what we would encounter if we chose to proceed with the pace funding program and energy efficiency rebates. He took some time to go up into our attic on our roof and to correctly assess the project scope. We invited other contractors to visit the house. No one else had taken as much time to ensure that our final quote was accurate. After Steve's visit, we met with Jaime, an advisor who walked us through the entire process. He provided us with accurate pricing and a quick turnaround. Our financing was approved on the spot while we talked with him at our dining room table. (masked up but still able to talk face to face) We were super surprised that within a month, we had a new roof, a new HVAC unit on our roof with dual stage electric functionality. Our energy bills have decreased and our roof looks amazing. Because American Home Energy Savers is a general contractor we were also able to tackle another project. Our porch needed to be reinforced. They were able to do that for us. We are super happy with the experience. We had a couple of small minor issues that they immediately remedied.

10 out of 10 would recommend again.< /Text>

AH did a fabulous job with my electrical and plumbing replacement, so when my A/C went out they were my first pick. When they couldn't send out a repairman the first day, they showed up with a portable ac to keep us cool until they showed up ontime and did excellent work.</Review>

<Review>We have used several heating and air services over the years and none compare to American Home Energy Savers. There professional service, communication and consideration of family is top notch. Love them so much we have recommended them to many family members and friends. Unlike the other company’s they don’t harass us for additional services and they let us know the cost up front with no surprises. Give them a try and you won’t be disappointed!!!A+< /Review>< user_name>

<Review>I responded to the flyer I received in the mail advertising a SMUD rebate, and I'm so glad I did. I met with Pablo Gonzalez on May 10th and we sat down and discussed all my options for the new HVAC system I needed, as my equipment was nearly 30 years old.

Pablo was very informational and was very pleasant to deal with. I had previously talked to, two other companies that actually quoted me lower prices, but Pablo pointed out what I was getting and what I wasn't getting from these other two companies, and that made it easier to make my final decision.

I was very impresses by the level of professionalism that Pablo brought to the negotiation. He gave me a great deal, I agreed to hire "American Home" AND the equipment and installation came the very next day.

5 stars all the way.

The workers that did the install were fast, efficient, friendly and helpful. Great experience overall and I love my new HVAC system.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqCf6-lA90YbYlbvHVHGGIu7eLf4MV78Y2rZUW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< resp>

Great communication with Jaime. They came in and out quickly efficiently and professionally. They repaired the work that was left undone by the realtors that sold me my home. Putting in new ducting, upgrading my insulation and making my electrical up to code. Thanks to them I am warm and safe for the winter. I would use them again with out a doubt.< /Text>

I had a new roof and a high efficient hot water heater installed. I’m  extremely happy with both. Every single person I had.contact with was so professional, courteous, knowledgeable and clean.
I would use them again for anything I should ever need for my home. I understand they do windows and many other things. I can’t say enough good things about this company. Both Jonathan & Jaime were committed  to make me happy. And they did. Thank you both for your extreme prompt help in making this happen. 👍🏼<//Review>

<Review>Before talking about my experience with American Home Energy Savers, I want to say, I highly recommend them!
From the moment when I first called to schedule an appointment, the lady who answered the phone was very nice, and helped me schedule an appointment that worked for me.
The job we needed done was reroofing our home. When Jaime came out to take a look, not only did they give us a detailed estimate but he also showed us the problem areas and took the time to explain to us the different types of materials, the quality of each and difference in pricing.
When it came time to actually do the work, the workers were at our home on time, they were very respectful of our property and finished the job quickly! I was amazed by how quickly they did the job.
Again, I cannot express how pleased we are with the Company and how thankful we are of Jaime for helping us through this whole process, as this is the first time having to do this to our home.

Thank you American Home Energy Savers.< /Review>< pictures>

They like to send misleading and fraudulent mass marketing letters. Don't trust them. If they resort to this to get customers, who knows what other shady business practices they have.

Edit: As evidenced by their tone-deaf response below, they clearly see nothing wrong with their fraudulent business practices. It's almost as if they didn't even read my review, and just looked at the low rating.< /text>

My hot water heater went out on a Friday late afternoon. I was calling different companies Saturday to see if any of them could help me out. No dice, until i called American Home Energy Savers. They were able to install a loaner water heater, while we figured out the best water heater for my home. My wife was very happy about that.
I would recommend this company to friends and family.</review>< Pictures>

< Review>
AHE recently installed a new hvac unit in my home.  Our salesperson Jaime really knew his stiff and was able explain the operation of today’s new systems better than two of their competitors that we also spoke to.  We had a breaker issue after installation and they responded immediately and resolved the issue on the spot.  Six months after installation we realized one room still was not cooling quite as well as the rest of the house.  Jaime got the installer out within days and they re-ran a larger duct to the room without question or cost.

I would absolutely recommend AHE, Jaime and Andriy for any installation.  They will take care of you.<//Review>

<Review>Celeste, Technician Inspector Aaron, and Sales Person Pablo were helpful and nice. We are a low income family and never had AC when we moved into our house 17 years ago. We received a brochure from AHES about SMUD rebates and we were looking forward to save some money to finally get comfortable. They never show up on time since they are busy with previous homes, but they're nice people. Pablo came a few weeks later with quotes about the AC, but when we heard that the rebates only applied to the 2 most expensive ones, we decided not to do it. Smud rebate was going to cover atleast $4K, but we needed to spend about $15K before rebate. And we couldn't do it.

The reason why I gave them 3 stars, is because Pablo was not responsive. I know he tried to work through his schedule to make an an appointment to meet with my mom, but he never confirmed the appointment or replied to my messages like he didn't care.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

My husband was out of town, and Jaime realized the urgency and worked day and night to ensure us that everything was going to be secured to pass any inspection, a guarantee on the correct installation and efficiency of our hot water heater,  along with, incredible savings that will continue for years to come.  His honesty and reliability was second to none.  Jaime worked with my husband over the phone and just made things happen quickly and happily, within our budget!  I am still amazed and pleased with his dependability and selflessness.  Thank you, Jaime for making a miracle happen overnight with absolutely no stress; nor, insecurities about quality.  Job perfected!  You are the best!

<text>Matt came to my house last week for an inspection on our furnace. The company offered to do this at no cost due to a partnership with the Sacramento Food Bank. It sounded a little odd to me but I wanted to help out a good cause. My husband was a little skeptical and I almost cancelled my appointment. I am glad I didn't. When he was finished he said there were a few things we need to discuss. I figured this is where the selling portion of the appointment. Instead, he proceeded to show me several photos he had taken during inspection and educated me on our system. He gave me instructions on how to care for my unit to get the most out of it and to prevent potential problems. He explained most people do not maintain their units because they don't know what to do or who to call. That is no longer true for me!! I will be participating in one of their programs that offers yearly check ups. They have two plans to chose from and after research I was shocked at how reasonable the prices were.

Also thank you Steven for knocking on my door and presenting me with this opportunity. We are very satisfied to say the least and will recommend you to our family and friends.< /text><user>107059448608651773184< /user><Gmap_id>0x809ad9df430f114f:0x9950c5c6ae2fd9< /Gmap_id>< date>

<text>It was a pleasure working with Jaime and other staff members.  He provided a great service on behalf of American Home Energy Savers.  The initial inspection was very thorough and I received a quote for the replacement of my HVAC including duct work very quickly.  The quote was neither the most expensive nor was it the least expensive.  It was pretty much a middle of the road quote.  He provided constant communication with me so that the job was done to my expectation and understood my issues with the current unit and aimed to get my problem fixed.  I would recommend using this company and working with Jaime in the future.</text>< user>

Jaime and his crew were on time and considerate throughout the entire day.
We had a bathroom window, sliding glass door and two main picture windows replaced.  The installation went flawlessly and considering the amount of work that had to be done,  they were done very quickly.  I would recommend them again.< /review>

Matthew (Matt) Lazard was so helpful and extremely kind. He was very professional, experienced, and well taught at his job. He left us his business card, saying to reach out if we need any help with our heating or water units. Definitely recommend this company and this man. He arrived straight on time and did not waste any time. He showed extreme diligence when needing access to the attic; as it's located in a closet, instead of just climbing up getting all the clothes dirty, he made sure to get a cover for it to stay clean. I really appreciated that. On top of being an expert in his field, he has fantastic customer skills. Keep up the great work. If you are unsure about calling this company, be sure now!< /review>

We had a wonderful experience with Jamie.  He was very helpful in explaining our options and getting us financing.  He was always respectful of our wishes, and made adjustments as necessary.  We were more than happy with this whole experience.  We definitely would recommend Jamie to anyone!< /Text>

My parents asked I leave this review for them. They were very impressed with how Matt conducted himself at their home. He was professional and well mannered. Their furnace is very old and has been worked on several times. What they liked so much was his understanding that they are operating on a fixed income and he gave they a couple of options to choose from with the goal of preventing larger repairs from being needed. I'd like to thank you as well for taking good care of them. There have been a couple situations where sales people took advantage of the situation.< /text>

< review>
Jaime and Mike came out to look at our water heater, furnace, and AC. We knew the work needed to be done because of how deteriorated the water heater and furnace were and how high our energy bills were.  Our home warranty company had already told us that they basically weren’t going to replace anything until they blew up, but we were worried about how we could afford to replace everything.

Jaime worked with us on the price, gave us options for financing, even got us a good chunk of rebates, and it all cost pretty much just as much as it would have if we found a random low cost handyman who wouldn’t have necessarily done as good of a job or provided a warranty. Their team came out to do the work as soon as all the paperwork was signed. They were fast, friendly, and made sure to check in with us about what they were doing. I highly recommend them if you need to upgrade your home. Better safe then sorry and risk a house explosion from a bad water heater or furnace, or crazy electric bills from an old AC unit.<//review>

I had an appointment scheduled for this morning. Matt called an hour a head of time to let me know he was roughly 30 minutes behind which was much appreciated. My furnace is older (22 yrs) but has been running fairly well, so I thought. After his diagnostic, he showed me some pictures he had taken and explained everything in a way I could understand. They way he put it was he didn't see anything that would make him think it was going to stop working anytime soon but it's probably time to start getting bids so I know what to prepare for. I was happy he didn't blow the situation out of proportion. If the financing he told me about looks good we should be able to do business.<//review>

<Text>We had American Home Energy Savers install an electric heat pump water heater that was eligible for a SMUD rebate. Jaime was very professional and answered all of our questions before we signed a contract. The installation went smoothly, it passed city inspection with no problem, and we have had no trouble with the unit. We also had the company do some fairly minor plumbing jobs and those were handled quickly and efficiently. The company provided all of the paperwork needed for the SMUD rebate and we received the rebate quickly with no problems. Great service!<//Text></record>

<Pics>None</Pics><rating>5< /rating><username>Natalie Wilson< /username><review>In early October of this year our AC stopped working, and within one week of that, a pipe burst underground, next to our garage.  We had three companies give us an estimate for the AC, and one (different company) come out for the pipe.  I can’t tell you how stressful this was, facing how much money we were about to spend.  Then, we met Jamie Schultz from American Home Energy Savers.  Jamie has an energy about him that immediately put us at ease.

We had learned with the first and second estimates (different companies) that it wasn’t just our AC unit, but our entire duct system that needed to be replaced.  Additionally, the plumber that came out to fix the pipe had quoted us $6500.  Jamie was also able to fix the pipe, and did it for $2000.  Jamie is incredibly knowledgeable about where a person can save money.  We ended up replacing our entire HVAC system, with extensive SMUD rebates.  He took care of all of the paperwork.  Overall, what had been incredibly stressful, was really an easy process.

The work is now done in our house; it took about two days to complete.  Here is the reason I decided to sit down and write this review now.  I was cleaning my kitchen tonight and looked at the inhalers and aero chamber that always sit on the counter.  I realized we hadn’t used it in the house in over a month…ever since the HVAC replacement, and actually put it away in the bathroom. One of the things we really stressed with Jamie is that if we were going to do this, we wanted it to benefit our daughter, who has asthma.  Jamie felt that with the right duct & filtration system her breathing might improve…and it really has!  We just went and visited family over Christmas and she was right back to coughing and clearing her throat.  She came home & now she’s fine.  I can’t believe its winter and she hasn’t had to go to the doctor at all!

This was a big deal for us.  This is our first home and our first real “homeowner” problem.  If you are going through this, I urge you to call Jamie Schultz at American Home Energy Savers.  I know you will be as happy a customer as I am.< /review><user_id>100638084187047171108<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

I am extremely happy with American Home Energy Savers in general and Jaime Schulz in particular.
The old water heater at my mothers house was well past needing replacing. However, the cost of a new unit runs into the thousands of dollars.
Just shy of $6000 to be a bit more accurate.
Since mom is on a fixed income and doesn't have anything like enough leftover after monthly expenses to afford a new unit. Jaime used some very respectable financial Kung Fu to help her to get the new one she so badly needed.
Infact, he manage to persuade to the other partners in the machinery of the water heater replacement biz to to provide it to her at a cost or exactly zero dollars and zero cents.
Thank you A.H.E.S and a very special thank you to Jaime Shulz<//review>

The LA store gets five stars, HOWEVER, Ninebot Segway is another story. The price was the best on the store's web site at the time I wanted to buy two G30 Max scooters. I ordered them with no issues after a friendly talk with a store clerk at the Brick and Mortar Store in LA. A week later my wife and I were unpacking our new toys. I was able to follow the directions, load the app on my phone and connect the G30 to my phone through the app without paying much attention, nice! My wife noticed that the G30 she was working with seemed to have been out of the box before. When we got to the Bluetooth pairing part there was no blinking Bluetooth light on the dashboard of the G30 and it would not connect with my wife's phone. The manual reads that there should be a blinking blue light with the Bluetooth icon and when we called tech service they said the same thing and that the main control board was the issue. We sent the G30 back and got a replacement two weeks later. Set up went the same way, no Bluetooth light. Tech service agent said we would have to send it back, AGAIN!
Just for giggles I called the LA store. The clerk was super nice. He fired up a G30 on the store floor and said there is no blinking light on G30's. then he said to try connecting it to my phone and it connected right away!
The issue was with my wife's phone, Tech service insisted it was a control board issue if there was no light blinking and the Ninebot manual clearly states there should be a Bluetooth Icon blinking during the pairing phase, NOT.
I sent a note back to Tech service and the store about the issue, the clerk thanked me, tech service was unresponsive. What a hassle! Horrible Tech service and bad manuals.
The G30's are a blast to ride! We enjoy taking them to cities and towns to explore new areas. We giggle and laugh the whole time we ride! Two 60+ year old kids!< /text>

If you like Segway Los Angeles you will love this tour.  2 hours of fun!  If you love fun facts, and are from out of town this is a pretty fun thing to do.  $49/person seems pricey, but we walked away amused and super happy.<//Text>

I had so much fun! Very easy to learn, and they had a training session before the tour to make sure you feel comfortable! Drew was our tour guide very informative.<//review>

They went above and beyond!!! I busted the charger to my ninebot go kart last night. I texted them before 7am they responded, had the charger set aside and ready for me to pick it up by 8am. They don’t even open until 10am. Can you say GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! To go with a great product? I can, Thanks a billion guys...<//text>

The segs are  great fun and easy to handle after a little practice in their office before you hit the road. Great staff, really friendly and helpful. You can have a seg with a little bag on too to hold valuables. Would definitely recommend. Me and my party of 3 absolutely loved it< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Two of our cousins came in from Europe and we though what a great way to show them the Venice/Santa Monica Coast Line. We had never been on a Segway before and all of us were a little nervous, but with the help of the wonderful staff we were trained, felt confident and on our way we went.

What an amazing fun time we had-Our tour guide Kyle was AWESOME and anyone who takes this particular tour MUST request him-he was knowledgeable, fun, patient and didn't mind taking our pictures constantly. I can't even begin to express what a fantastic time we all had. We will definitely be back again-this time with some local friends.<//review><UserId.>105794091486484011822<//UserId.>< Pictures>

We had enough time near the end of our trip to LA to book a Segway ride. My daughters were the ones who wanted to go, my wife and I were nervous in the beginning, but our guide was awesome and all we needed was the quick training session in the beginning to get us pretty comfortable on the Segways and then off we went. They were really easy to ride on and this turned out to be one of the most fun activities we had as a family.< /Text>

Really great place. They actually gave us 2 hours on the beach, they didn't count the training time. Great view and u can cover a lot of ground on the segways. Would definitely go back.</Text>

<Text>These Segways are really fun to drive, and the paths along Santa Monica and Venice Beach are the best possible places to drive them.  I paid $91 total for a two hour tour that included easy training inside the store, followed by a guided tour along the beaches, and out to the end of  the Venice Fishing Pier.  The tour guide was great and very knowledgeable.

Wear sunscreen!!!  The earlier in the day you book your tour the better.  Mine was at 10 a.m., so the weather was cool and the paths were not too crowded.<//Text>< Pictures>

Yes it's more expensive than renting a bike, but it's SO much more fun! Friendly helpful staff. Good instruction. Surprising how fast you get used to riding.</text>

Great place! I rented from them a few times. They are very friendly and professional. They have plenty of Segways so even if you come with a group they have enough of them. They are in good condition and ride great. They give you a great introduction when you are new to Segways and ride with you for the first few minutes to make you feel safe. Definitely going back there.</review>

<text>We booked the Venice tour wel in advance through the website. The website is more sophistcated than the location itself. On the day i would pas it (if you pas it). The instructions were good for us novices, but the guide (we thought) had better things to do then go on tour with us. So it became a self guided tour, with extra time as a bonus. It was a great experience, with al the credits to the Segway itself.<//text>< pics>

Juan very friendly and Has a great team!!! I see why people say don't judge a book by its cover you shouldn't anyway but don't let it deter you elsewhere they did a great job inside and out..it was an older vehicle and they made it look so fresh and new ...I even left my charger connected ...I didn't find it and they said everything will be in the trunk we find...sure enough there everything was...Juan also referred us to a auto repair for the AC ...I wish now I would've bought them all lunch for their good and hard work..😔<//Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>I was treated with courtesy and respect the employees were professional and thorough. I brought in my 2021 Subaru Assent which I recently purchased, I asked for a hand wash and wax to protect the new paint. My wife was surprised to see difference in the appearance of the paint after the wax. They also cleaned and vacuumed the interior, dressed the tires and cleaned the wheels. The glass was cleaned inside and out all for a very reasonable price. I told Jose that I will be returning there once a month for the service. I recommend California Auto Detailing for anyone who can appreciate a great service at a very reasonable price.<//Text>< Pics>

We had just bought this massive SUV a couple a days ago and the previous owner had three kids therefore it was filthy inside and after the cleaning it literally looked like a new car, the cleaners obviously put a lot of passion and work in their job.
I'll be more than happy to bring any car back to this place for more cleaning.< /text><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

The owner of this business is very welcoming and professional.  I took my vehicle in for a Wax and they did a great job.  Don't be discouraged by the location, this place is truly about customer service! Highly recommended!</Text>

Jose, the Owner, is super sweet and does his best to accommodate your needs with the right price.  He's down to earth and very humble.  However, I thought when I got our SUV cleaned it was going to include the inside, at least, being wiped down with a towel.  Jose, himself gets out there an.<//text>

<review>I used them for the first time recently for an inside, outside and engine detail in order to get my older car ready to be sold. They exceeded all my expectations! I was blown away by the job they did on my 2009 vehicle. The upholstery was clean, the outside sparkled and the engine looked brand new! I sold my car to the first person who looked at it and I credit Jose at California Car Wash. I will be using them again. I highly recommend their services.</review><Date>1553460407677< /Date><user_name>Darwin Smock<//user_name>< UserId.>

< Review>
Awesome experience! After our car was broken into while we were visiting Bakersfield, we went to CA Car Detail to get the glass out. They were super nice and offered to do the job free of charge. They did a great job getting the glass out and covering the window so we could get back home safely with our dogs and baby. Thanks so much!!!< /Review>

I was headed to another place and thought I would look for somewhere different.   I am so glad I found this place.  I can actually trust these guys with my expensive car.  I had them wash and hand wax my car and I'm very happy with both the results and the price. They actually take pride in their work as well as provide personalized service.< /Text>< Pics>

Jose was kind to fit me in at any time of my choice the following day, I just got a fresh paint job and wanted water spots and dust/dirt removed on outside of the car. Jose and his crew made it look better than 99% of the other detail shops I went to. You would pass by this place and would not give it a try due to how it looks, but your loss they do great work!<//review>

Jose has great customer service and does an amazing job. Car looked and smelled wonderful.
Came Saturday with no appt to get my interior detailed and he still managed to get my car done in three hours and there were 3 other cars in front of me. Thanks Jose I'll be returning. If you want it done well bring your vehicles to Jose you won't be disappointed.</Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1486485680417, 'text': 'Thanks for the great review Julian!

Jose and his crew did an amazing job! They were able to get me in last minute, which is awesome because you typically have to schedule in advance! My car was a DISASTER and when I went to pick it up it was spotless! I was worried they’d turn me away because it was so filthy with dog hair, but he said “not a problem!” The price is amazing! Don’t be fooled by its “hole in the wall” location - this place is awesome! Jose and his team were very professional and clearly take a lot of pride in their work. I will definitely be a return customer!<//Text>

Just got my car detailed here, and I got to say they did one hell of a job! The boss there by the name of Jose had the best customer service in town.. the place there is a real-life example of “Don’t judge a book by its cover” the service took about 3-4 hours however, you can be assured of a QUALITY finished the job. The price is lower than some other places here in Bakersfield, and with a better job done as well. I have been to another detail place on 24th street, and although they did an OK job it was far too expensive... not to mention the customer service was not up to par. Overall I feel that this place does not get enough attention as it should.< /review>

I have been to California Car Wash & Detail several times. They are prompt and do excellent car washing and detailing. Especially, as far as interior car detailing is concerned, they are awesome. My car's interior has never been cleaner. I plan to visit them again and recommend this car wash to others!< /text>

Jose and his crew do amazing work at a very competitive price.  Every time I think about selling my vehicle I take it in to get the full detail, inside and out.  Twice I’ve decided to keep it longer.  He has literally saved me thousands.< /review>

Incredible food. Service timing was a bit out of sync, but all dishes were excellent. Seafood paella was enormous and definitely the best one I have ever had. All ceviches and small plates we had were also fabulous.</review>

<Text>Food ingredient quality is pretty terrible, I had the steak nachos and the meat was BOTTOM of the barrel quality, each piece was gristly/ fatty, not an enjoyable meal at all other than the guac on top.
Please invest in better quality ingredients; also not a fan of the plastic cheese you used but this may be preferential as I know some Americans enjoy it.</Text>< date>

I was hungry and I decided to try something like   “Brazilian food”. When saw the name I figured I could find some “familiar “ food. After read Latin Fusion”  I put all my expectations and I had the most wonderful surprise. As a professional cook and former restaurant owner for decades, I can tell you. The food is amazing! Customer service wonderful! This place is so clean! There is only one bathroom and it’s very clean! The only issue is the fact I don’t live in Los Angeles, and I’ll miss this place so bad!! Next time I’ll be in LA, I’ll stop by FOR SURE!< /text>

Drove from Anaheim to this spot, watched an episode of Tasty and this place was billed World's Best Cuban Sandwiches. They were good, I don't know about world's best. The pork was flavorful, moist and tender. Sangria was a bit of a disappointment, didn't really have any alcohol in it and I ordered a pitcher, ended up leaving most of it. Service was good.< /review>

As someone who WORKS in the Hollywood and Highland, I gotta say, this is one of my favorite places to eat. Not sure where some of these bad reviews came from, but I assure everyone it’s one of the only places close by that actually makes FRESH food. As someone who cooks for his family at home, that means a lot to me. Especially with Mexican food, if you try to rush things as simple as beans or rice, they will come out uncooked and hard. This place has been 100% consistent with all of my orders. The salsas on the side are delicious! Their food is Creative! Got my co worker addicted recently 😊 Great job guys! You deserve a lot of success!<//review>

Good food, I got the chicken and beef tacos. Very flavorful and good service.
My friends got the Cuban sandwich and said they were on point!
Didn't give 5 stars because our table and bench were dirty.</review>

This is the best non-pretentious spot in the Dogpatch. The food is excellent and it still has its mom and pop charm. Try a michelada!< /Review>

Came here to eat today and the server was really rude and impolite. I should’ve Known that because there were nobody inside. He wasn’t knowledgeable because he couldn’t make the difference because tostones and sweet plantain. He was arguing with us telling tostones are sweet until the cook came in and told him he was wrong, instead of agreeing with the cook , he rather told that in his mouth tostones are sweet. There were a  tv and we all were watching the Barcelona game real Betis,  and he came in and turn it off to put music on. We told him we were watching the game. He put it back on , to come after 5 minutes saying “I need to put my music on because you guys are not paying attention to the game. I told him this is not how to treat customers he told me he doesn’t care. We were six people coming to this restaurant we spent more than $150. I will never set my foot inside this restaurant EVER<//text>

We did not like the food at all! The chicken has no taste or flavor, as well  as the the salsas, and the tortilla was raw. We are not coming back here!</Text>

<Review>Terrible service. I will never eat there anymore. Please if you are human DO NOT EAT THERE. This lady with tattoos and glasses with brown hair was very rude. She would also stare at me. She didn't let me stay there for more then five  minutes after i was done eating. My classmates and I were eating peacefully and she interrupted me.  Please do not eat here. She hates her job and does not take it seriously you can tell right away she is frustrated and something is wrong with her.  I asked for her name because i told her i would complain with her manager and she didnt tell me her name. Instead she was very mean and rude. She is extremely disrespectful with all customers. I can promise you if she did it to me she's done it to other customers.  So if your looking for LATIN FOOD GO SOMEWHERE ELSE AND THEY WILL TREAT YOU WITH RESPECT AND LET YOU ENJOY YOUR FOOD NICELY I HOPE THE MANAGER AND OWNER IS READING THIS BECAUSE SOMEONE WITH HER ATTITUDE SHOULD NOT WORK THERE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION.</Review>< Pics>

<review>Great place to eat. The food is great and the people were very nice. I had the grilled chicken breast sandwhich with fries, and it was one of best sandwhiches that I had while I visited California.

Had a delicious meal here about a week ago and already have a return plan. I had the brussel sprouts, polenta and chocolate torte. Yucca fries and bavette were aldo delish. And my mom raved about the burger. Very interesting flavors and friendly staff. Price didn't seem insane either. Interior is nicely done.< /Review>

Waited forty five minutes in line and twenty five minutes for the food at this fast food restaurant. The food is decent but the wait is not worth it. Do yourself a favor and don't wait if there is a line. Unless you have an extra hour of life to spare.< /Review>

<review>To the last post that was givin by Ray Harvey, that is certainly untrue. I was there when the incendent happened. They were not students but 2 young females and a older lady that seem like their mother. The oldest of the girls started harassing the cashier then the mom followed and started doing it as well. I hate when people write bad reviews of people when it’s the customers fault!! it’s so hateful what she wrote!
the nice cashier, her name is Carolina, she was very helpful, nice and understanding. Someone shouldn’t be described like that. The food was outstanding, delicious and it’s very WORTH it. do not believe this review!! EVERYONE DONT LISTEN TO THIS REVIEW ITS VERY UNTRUE!!!< /review>< Rate>

Friendly service but that was about it. It seemed to me the store was half stocked. A bunch of empty shelves. Couldn't find everything i was looking for. The prices are what you expect from Best buy. Nothing crazy.</review>

We bought a Switch while we were on vacation from Seattle. I couldn’t get it set up at the hotel for my son so I brought it back the next morning. Austin the general manager got it all set up and the game downloaded for our son. We are so thankful and now can continue our road trip in peace :) Your store has excellent members who are eager to help and take the time to get the job done.</Review>

<Review>I used the Best Buy curb service twice and both times was very efficient and easy to use. I put in my order, got an email ready for pick up, drove there and parked in their curbside spot, typed in my code number, and the employee came out with my purchase. Easy Peezy</Review>< Name>

Out of absolutely everything. Looked like they were going out of business and not a staff member in sight. Shame considering this used to be my go to best buy in the area. Covid and Amazon have very clearly put a dent in all the local best buys. I recommend just purchasing online and skipping the stores all together.</Review>

Was waiting for someone to help me for over 10 minutes while 6 employees standing around doing nothing but gossiping all in a circle hanging out. Wanted to look at the wireless headphone but 1 employee was leaning against the shelving on his phone blocking the isle. Not to mention the store is dirty check out is confusing and looks like there going out of business. Very disappointed 😞</text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I've been coming here for a couple years now and have not found a single thing to complain about, not that I'm looking for one.
The staff are always friendly and actually helpful when you ask them about products. The place is kept stocked, never had to come back or have something ordered.< /Review>

My husband  and I are steak and potatoes  eaters.. Every time we order a steak  Medium rare,  they bring it to us its well done. this was our 4th time order steak. We hate  Sending our food back, and when we do it's still overdone..They need to learn how to cook the steaks. Their rest of the food is good.<//text>

First impression is everything. So why have an employee that has attitude, no desire to be at work, and absolutely no customer service mindset. I have no idea how this person was even given the opportunity to work there.  His tone, rushed attitude, and demeanor was horrible. Regardless of how bad his day was, he definitely left a bad impression with me.  My visit was on Wednesday, December 30, 2020, at 6:50pm. Went inside for online order pick up.</Review>

Then "went missing at the store" after 4 days after delivery date was to occur i receive a call from a isabella asking me to call her back that the cards were no longer available yet they were purchased in stock? Poor Poor business practices. This review is just my first step in letting others know what to expect doing business with this store.

i called back 15 minutes after she left me a message and my order was already canceled and was unable to get ahold of anyone at the store.<//text>< pictures>

I recently tried ordered an MacBook Air online on September 28th, 2020. After paying for the purchase and everything, I got an email saying my payment wasn’t going through but on my bank statement they had already charged for the laptop. I contact Best Buy customer service via online chat, they were completely useless. Then I called Best Buy customer service, some lady told me my purchase didn’t go through even though I was telling her they charged me for it she said “after 24 hours your payment will be refunded to your card because when you do online purchase they need to charge you twice, once your purchase is delivered they will refund one payment back to you” which sounded beyond ridiculous to me. Next day when my money wasn’t back on my card I called again and the guy that helped me, simply told me my purchase didn’t go through and if I would like to have him help me buy it...again... Why would I do that when that one purchase already caused so much unnecessary chaos. Eventually I did get my money back, but then couple days later I get a email saying my order has been shipped and literally 2 days later I got the laptop, the next day Best Buy takes money out for the laptop and I figured since I got it I will use it only to find it not working properly. I returned the laptop via shipped from UPS, 2 weeks later I called customer service to see when my money would be refunded and I talked to 2 different people who told me they can’t locate my return or track it. I called UPS, they helped me track it only to find out my return got delivered on 10/19/2020. I have called customer service to find out what is going on, for some reason the call keeps getting cut off. I still don’t know what is going on. The in store service is good but online service and customer service is terrible.</review>

I was there earlier today to pick up an online order. My order wasn’t available for In-store pick and had to be brought out to me per the app so I had to do curbside pickup. There were 6 cars before me who all got helped before me as they should have. Then 4 vehicles came after me and got helped. I checked in as I was supposed to and waited patiently. Even spoke to the person bringing out the orders politely and informed him that I hadn’t seen the vehicle he was looking for at that time.  I wasn’t buying Black Friday weekend specials and this was a $1700 purchase.  I’m also roughly $100 away from My Elite Plus level so I spend a lot of money there; not that that should dictate the quality of customer service but if spending over $5k (with this purchase that I cancelled because of the terrible customer service) doesn’t get you decent customer service then I don’t know what will.  After explaining to the manager what had happened, his response was ‘Sorry about the wait.’  Completely ignoring that my issue wasn’t with the wait but the fact that 4 parties came after me and got their goods before me.   Having been an employee at the Arden Fair location for ~4 years in the past, I can say from personal experience, do yourself a favor and drive a little further to go there instead.  I will be from now on.  The convenience of the Natomas location doesn’t justify having to settle for their customer service.

<review>Great experience, they are open for business and are very helpful during times like this.

Some of the recent reviews that are complaining aren’t really honest reflections of the store’s issues, but more along the lines of the people writing the reviews having a personal issue. You may run into Tim Pitman, a male Karen who wrote an essay about how he had bad experiences at this location. Take the time to read his review and notice how in the last paragraph, he was talking about the week of cyber Monday...how entitled can you be? Seriously? The world doesn’t revolve around you, Tim. I don’t really care if you had to wait a little longer, and I’m positive no one else really cares either. I talked with the manager inside and I understand the stress they are going through. Just be happy and grateful that they are open for business, there’s really no reason to be so irate and insensitive to these individuals who are trying to do their job.< /review>< pics>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Review>Purchased a phone 11/24 with delivery date of 11/30 to avoid Black Friday shoppers and limit exposure to COVID. Tracked it and the app showed it was at the store 11/29 (early). Headed in and asked if they had it and was told it hadn't arrived yet (at 4:40pm). I went back on 11/30 (original arrival date) and was told it was still being unloaded (at 5:30pm). I went back Dec 1st...same answer...went back 12/2 and given the same answer but I refused to leave without a different answer. They searched and found the phone but could NOT release it to me due to an error code that no one could explain. "Communication error between Best Buy and the carrier." But also "a pre activation fail" even though I hadn't even had the opportunity to get the phone to try activating it. Was told I had to call their corporate number. I called while in store using their phone. The employee called his best buy/carrier liason too. 1.5 hours later...never got through to Corp. The employee was able to troubleshoot the issue only to tell me that based on the direction from the person on the other line, they gave him wrong info during the process and the issue would need further attention...finally after 2.5 hours in the store on 12/2...they closed and I left without a phone. Was told someone would work on the phone the next day. Got several calls from an employee who said my new phone was working and when I came in all I had to do was pay for taxes and insurance...because she had to reverse the original purchase. I arrive 12/3...no one can find the phone at first, then it has to "still be activated"(?), but then the discount still has to be re applied...three people are working on it with someone on the phone again only to be told that the person on the other line gave them wrong info during activation AGAIN and the phone has to be returned a 3rd time!!! (I've never even held this phone yet to own it let alone return it)....they stopped helping because they didn't know how to fix the issue and are waiting to give the phone back to the person who fixed it today (12/3)....this was after another 1.5 hours in their store tonight. I can't wait to see how tomorrow (12/4) turns out! I'm so glad I tried to be COVID conscious and try for minimal public exposure because this is the most I've been exposed recently. The answer to the issue they provided was consistently "not our problem " it was "the person on the phone who gave them bad directions." Complained mildly to the manager....he was completely dismissive and useless. #nophoneyet< /Review>< user_name>

The service was horrible. The employees that were there were more preoccupied with their phones than helping anyone. When I did get someone to answer a simple question (do you have any USB headphones for a computer) he just pointed and said "over there" he didn't even look up from his phone for more than a second. Then when I was in line waiting to purchase the headphones I found, the manager was walking around the store without her mask. Highly unlikely that I will return to this location.</review>

<userid>101815521078205595841< /userid><review>I used the curbside pick up. It works really fast. Just follow the instructions that say to have your government issued ID, and I had a screenshot on my iPad of the Order # along with the barcode from the email BestBuy sent me. There is a designated curbside parking area on the left side of this Best Buy. I parked in one of the curbside parking spots that has a special pole with a number on it. I only noticed 4 spots like this where I was (01, 02, 03, 04). When you click the button in your email that you are parked and ready for pick up. It asks if you are in a spot like this and to enter the number of your parking spot. Then you can click on the type of vehicle you are in, and the color of your vehicle. It then said the order would be out to me within 20 minutes. I was there at 7pm, it wasn't very busy, and they brought my merchandise out to me in about 1 or 2 minutes, it was really fast and easy. And it helped me stay special quarantined, since I didn't need to roll down a window, (I placed my iPad screenshot of barcode on the window and they scanned it through the window). I pointed to place the item at the back of my truck. And they placed my merchandise on the tonneau cover of my truck bed, and left, so I could get out and grab it with no one around. I really appreciate that Best Buy has this service right now, it really helped.< /review>< pictures>

<name>Tim Pitman< /name><text>So this has to be the worse location both in terms of items available and their employees.  Save yourself the headaches and drive the extra miles to the woodland location.  The Natomas location needs to either close or get a manager that knows what they are doing because the employees are a direct reflection of their manager.

So I checked online for an 82” tv. The best but in Natomas showed they had 1. Since now they claim that the associates cannot verify inventory I drive to the location and it still showed 1 available. Spoke to an associate who verified that they had 1 left. He left and 39 minutes later he came back to say they didn’t have 1. His excuse was that whoever sold the last one didn’t take it off inventory. Lol   Does he think this is 1980? Once an item sells it reduces the available units instantly not sure how he doesn’t understand that. So I ask him if he could check other stores and possibly call them so I don’t drive somewhere else and same thing happen. He says he will check, came back and told me that no one had any of them within 150 miles. Needless to say I wasn’t confident he knew what he was talking about so I took the chance and went to woodland where they had 8 of the same tv. He said that the Natomas location was “screwed up” and that many customers come from Natomas to woodland because they are horrible there. Could not have agreed more.

Fast forward to today. Placed an order for 2 ink cartridges. Was told it should take less than an hour. Went to location because I can’t go into the store which is irrelevant since they offer curbside pickup which I needed this time. Long story short I waited for 90 minutes and no one came out. I finally caught someone delivering to another vehicle and he told me that they had 600 orders to prepare. Okay then don’t tell the customer it will be ready in an hour. Never again will I order or pick up anything from that location again. Incompetence would be a nice of saying what this location is all about.

Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Rate>1<//Rate><Gmap_id>0x809ad64bc3e77cc3:0x163ce550f2d6f9f9</Gmap_id>< date>

<review>I purchased a PlayStation plus subscription at this store and they said they would email us the code to enter. Fast forward 6 days and after countless hours of waiting on the phone (only for the calls to be disconnected), we still are yet to receive this code. Today we even went back to the store to ask, and they simply just gave us the same number to call and told us we would definitely get it this time. As you might imagine, we didn’t get anything after 2 hours of waiting and a disconnected call.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

<review>This best buy is always clean and well staffed unfortunately having so many staff members doesnt always mean your gonna find someone to help. It's just like any place you have workers who go up and beyond while others are just kinda there. I've had my ups and downs in this Best Buy, just gotta roll the dice and hope u get some one good.< /review>< Rating>

The manager rushed me out the door after 45 min of waiting for customer service telling me that no blue tooth speaker would connect to my phone or work in my car. I own a Lg k51. Thank you for the awful service hope you get better managers that know what they are talking about.</Text>

Honestly the store was dirty, laptop selection looked like it was barley put together. I would try to get someone to redo that laptop section. Staples was so much better even though that had four laptops to choose from.< /Review>

Did not have what I needed weren't willing to help me find something comparable in the same price range they have no local store phone number cuz they said it is not not obsolete now and we'd have to call a different store in order to get information which is just ridiculous so bad customer service all the way around store has really gone downhill< /text>

Found & purchased an antenna for the TV in the 2nd bedroom. They were working on the building and made it very difficult to hear the clerk at check out. It took longer than normal to pay for my purchase due to the noise making it almost impossible to hear each other.< /Text>

Customer service is lacking usually. There are a few good people that care about helping others. But most of the time the Millennials just avoid talking to people and diddle with stuff on the shelves. Usually when I go in there. I have to physically. Track someone down and ask them for help. The service department Is excellent though? And very attentive to your needs.
I love Best Buy. And have been shopping there for decades. It has not always been this way. As with all businesses good help is hard to find sometimes. They have the best warranties for their products in the business. Better than Fry's, RC Willey , Ikea.< /review>

The store over all is great the only reason for the 4 star rating is because they have had drones for quite some time and it would be nice to see more affordable drones as well it seems as though they have not restocked or stocked for a long time any drone under about $500 that would be awesome< /text>

There was barely any customers but multiple employees but still they couldn't help. They just walked past me and anyone else who needed help. I've also called multiple times in advance but nobody ever picks up. Only one time someone picked up but that was only to hang up right away. It takes a lot for me to actually publicly post a bad review online. This is one of the worst customer service experiences I've had. The one person that did finally help me had absolutely no idea what she was doing, she had to call over one of her friends that was standing around
to help her. It took an hour to do something that should've only took 20-25 minutes MAX.</Text></record>

Recently had to buy a washer buy I didn't wanna spend more than what Craigslist was charging for one, so I found a good deal and made absolute sure that it was in stock, it was eligible for the promotion,and that if I were to pick it up, I would receive an additional discount due to the fact that NO ONE is allowed In the store right now...the GM & his staff called after I emailed them and helped facilitate a smooth easy transaction once I arrived at the store.  Checkout was a breeze as a register just within the first set of double doors allowed me to pay AND use the in store promo without risking exposure.  Helped load it in and everything.

The employees at this Best Buy has got to be some of the friendliest and nicest people I've met in a long time.  I even chatted with some customers whom all expressed the same beliefs. I had a great time on this store today and will I be returning....DEFINITELY!<//Text>

<Text>Horrible! No help when asked. I was told by a "sales representative" there were blank cd's and dvd's for sale, come to find out they do not and haven't for awhile. There's no diversity with the employees, the shelves were clutter if they weren't empty.  There's more, but just know that going to Best Buy is a waste of time. No stars.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< username>

There are more blue shirt workers then shoppers, and they all stand by at the cashier laughing around..Stand at appliance section for 15 minutes and no one come to help.

<Text>I don't give less than 5 stars review, but Best Buy deserves it. I was told that my camera will be ready by November 11, 2019. It's 13th of the month and still waiting for an update. Last time when I talked to the representative, he said: "I can't give you an ETA." In the future, I will prefer shopping with Amazon or any other merchant.<//Text>< userid>

Natomas Best Buy was very pleasant and there were a lot of people there all seemed like they were enjoying their visit. I got the help needed about a couple of things and he was very professional and guided me to what I was looking for and even took the time to look up on websites to confirm that it is what I'm looking for and will work for my job thank you so much ill be back when I need something else ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 👍👍🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸<//review>

Nice place, never seems too busy. This can have a downside as sometimes the pickings are slim for the little things. PC components are a bit sketchy but all the tv stuff, cellular phones and sound you could ask for.</Review>

< Review>
Geek Squad had become complacent. There were people waiting before me. Yet no one was helping them until someone had to get them from the back. No one asked me if I needed help even though the sign says someone will be right with me. So feeling neglected I left after I informed the guy at the door. Guess they don't need the business.</Review>

One of the most convenient BB stores in Sacramento area. Highly recommended for electronic,  home appliances, phones and home theater. Visit the place if you need to buy something quick. Early access and well lighted place. Good prices and there are many choice to choose with different brands, colors and sizes. You need to check it out yourself to see what it works best for you and your price range. Bring a friend too. You can sit at TV home theater section and enjoy the big screen. It worth!</text>

It's worth getting their extended warranty on items as they do stand behind it.  I've never had any hassle with replacement. And if then product is not offered anymore, they allowed an upgrade to the newest version with only paying the difference. First time I ever had a store do that for me.<//review>< Rate>

<Text>One of the most convenient BB stores in Sacramento area. Highly recommended for electronic,  home appliances, phones and home theater. Visit the place if you need to buy something quick. Early access and well lighted place. Good prices and there are many choice to choose with different brands, colors and sizes. You need to check it out yourself to see what it works best for you and your price range. Bring a friend too. You can sit at TV home theater section and enjoy the big screen. It worth!< /Text></record>

I love this best buy. Way better than the best buy in arden mall. Clean place, clean crowd, and plenty of parking spaces available. I've bought a few items from this store even a couple of smartphones. There's a mobile specialist named Waheem. He's the go-to guy if you want to purchase phones. Overall, this store is worth going a couple extra miles than the one down in Arden.< /Review>

Was a little different disappointed.  Stock was low or out on alot of products.  It was hard to find help with product questions.  When I got help seemed like he was in a hurry to do something else.  Ended up leaving the store and just buying on line.</Text>

Everyone was really helpful here!  I didn't have to figure out where to go because more than one person offered to show me. I didn't need to figure out what kind of printer to buy because I told them what I needed and they showed me a couple of options that would suit and how to get the best deals on ink. This was much better than figuring everything out on my own at a general store.<//text>

<Review>I had a really fantastic interaction at this location. I used Google maps to navigate here in hopes of purchasing a Samsung Frontier S3 smart watch. I looked around for a minute without being harassed and asked the doorman to have a rep open the cafe and grab the watch. I store manager came over and assisted me. He was very friendly and the store looked clean and the reps were professional.</Review><date>1547779645045< /date>< user>

This Best Buy was the worse. We stood in line at customer service waiting on the evening of Tuesday, Septemver 24, 2019 while the workers were just standing and walking around socializing with one another. Very unprofessional and unorganized. The manager on site was throwing around peace signs to the workers and acting so unprofessional. We waited for 30 minutes for service. Please discipline your manager on site and manage your workers to it's full potential. I hate being that customer but I will speak up if I am clearly being ignored.< /Text>

This store is well laid out with overhead signs that help shoppers find the right area.  I was there to purchase a Wi-Fi extender (day after Black Friday) and was assisted by a very helpful employee who was doing inventory of that area.  Even better, the product that best meet my need was on sale.  Yay!
The employee even offered to ring up the item so that I didn't have to get in the check-out queue.  Great service!<//Text>

< Review>
I've never had an issue whenever I stop by this or any of the surrounding Best Buy stores. They always have a great variety of items from your basic computers cables to dedicated graphics cards, monitors, hard drives, and everything in between. Recently I had an excellent experience with their Customer Service team and wanted to leave a note about it. I wanted to return a computer monitor I purchased from a different Best Buy store so I could upgrade to a 144hz 2k monitor.

When I bought the monitor, I thought I still had my Best Buy Elite Plus benefits which includes a 45-day return policy. However, when I bought this monitor I did not realize that my benefits had elapsed, which meant that I only had a 15-day return policy and I didn't not realize that I was past the return period until I was at the store trying to return the monitor.

To keep the story short, the store associate reached out to his manager and was able to receive approval to process a full return (because they did not have a 144hz 2k monitor available). Even though he had every right to simply cite store policy and deny the return outright. It's little experiences like these that keep me coming back to Best Buy for all my minor and major purchases.

Now I have to work my way back up through the rewards system to regain my Best Buy Elite Plus benefits!<//Review>

But if you don't there's no real attentiveness from the sales floor to come help. Even after being in their section for 20 mins no one approached me abd ask questions. I didn't see the phone I wanted on display and had to go ask b4 I was recognized as a customer. The Arden location are very aware of customers presence, usually greetings them within 5-10 mins in their sections. There were at least 3 in the cell phone section doing nothing so being busy was not the problem here. A lot of people don't ask questions if they can't find the item they're looking for. That's missed opportunities and potential loss $$$ walking out the door. 5 mins of attentive customer service goes a long ways in retail fyi<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

<Text>This is more of a review of a product and not the store. The Samsung phones with the curved screens suck. I have an Otter Box and not even that could stop the phone from cracking after dropping it. I'll go back to Samsung after they get rid of the curved screen and/or create a case that covers the curve that I don't even use!< /Text><user>106617356344592277642<//user>< Rate>

I usually hate best buy because of the poor customer service,  however this time I actually had a good shopping experience.   A young girl , very knowledgeable helped with all of my needs including the best buy extra insurance.   The wait time was short.  They seem to not have hot item's on hand like the ps4 sold completely out and no rain -check offered.</Text>

<review>So as usual (for most stores, if even in stock as posted) item that was advertised on google for one price I found to be in store for almost $10 more, and approx. 9 of 10 were already opened boxed (returned).  I felt stalked by "older gentleman salesman" who followed me from door then stood by as I looked around, talking to my son.  Then during my purchase he told me I "had" to have additional $20 item to work the item I purchased,  just for me to get home and find my item worked perfectly without it. Thank you to the two younger employees at the front door who actually knew what they were talking about.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

The Notomas Magnolia Center was exactly what we needed after loosing our home in the Campfire.  We purchased our entire home electronics and entertainment in one trip and schedule a single delivery the day after we close escrow.   the sales Associate was remarkably knowledgeable about the products int eh store. I had come having done all my research on what products i wanted and he either confirmed those choices or showed me a better alternative (And not always a more expensive one).  I actually spent about 1,000 less then i budgeted or was prepared to and never felt pressured or steered to a product i didn't want or like.< /Text>

Great store if you don't need to return an item. I received a gift that needed to be returned or exchanged. Because I did not have the original receipt I could not exchange for store credit or anything else. I have a new item I have no use for. When receiving a gift you usually don't receive the receipt...or do you?<//text>

<review>Bad customer service ever . I have protection plan iwant to use it . The employee call dain black short guy also he dont have name tag so Idont know if he said his name correct .he said he is manger and he dont want to replace for me because idont have the box and cover . He was rude with me and say go to different store who sell it to u . Im here manger idont will do it for you . I spent my money in this store so i get bad employee not respectful at all. Iwant to different store they do it for me in 2 minutes. Also i ask him can i see the policy for replacement plain require that . He said no . At the end good luck for bestbuy if they put as manger with such morals.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>
<Review>Honestly. As a wholesaler, electronics salesman, OfferUp Craigslist etc pro. Best buy took care of me on my personal ipad. Price matched on both accessories. It came out to the price of one. 69.99 case. 59.99 case. Both 31.00$ and 24$. Easy fast in store pickup. Would go again.</Review><rating>5</rating><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOsi-HlXobDbBhjE1D9H6Nwxm9xHCI6rVrH8ZnR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< resp>

This Best Buy does not stand by its products. If a product is damaged when you first open it, they will still charge you the restocking fee.

My experience: I opened a "new" phone to see that it was damaged and not working properly. I bought a replacement from Amazon because it was a work week and I did not have time to go to the store, then I attempted to return the phone when the same weekend came. Edwin, a supervisor, said, "well you should have returned it the same day" and insinuated that I was the one who broke the phone. This is why I bought my replacement phone from Amazon - they stand by their products and treat their customers with respect. The phone was broken out-of-box and I was forced to eat a $35 restocking fee despite returning it the same week.< /text>

Every once and a while you'll get a pushy salesperson or someone who will give you the "let me check in the back" then walk off to talk with friends within eyesight. Overall decent Best buy.

<Text>Never a big fan of this place, but I seen online that they buy your used camera equipment and got a far quote online.. So I head down to store and was I completely surprised that they not only offered me $75 on a quote of $350 online but that they said I didn't get a quote.. When I returned home and contacted customer care they too said I never got quote.. Thing is you are giving option to save online chat and I did so.. I even sent a copy of chat and was told they could not help me. I found a awesome store Down town Sacramento and they gave me a great quote and when I went in I got the $275 they offered. Won't use these guys again.< /Text></record>

<Review>Spent 2 hours driving there and back to get a special water proof blue tooth speaker that does not even work. Do yourself a favor and never buy a ion Bluetooth product. Don't have the extra time to drive back so now my family goes on vacation to the lake with no sound. Nice 👌<//Review>< Gmap_id>

<Text>The service is really bad, stayed there for like 30 minutes just looking for a help, i know its a busy season that's why the management MUST at least double the staff or even triple it during this time of the year. Honestly so special to find or even some good deals, for me i was a little bit disappointed and thought this place would more interesting.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

I walked in hoping to purchase an amplifier and I was approached by some guy his name was probably Boris or something but he had an aggressive vibe from the get go and started almost interrogating me and basically dismissing whatever I was telling him. He couldn’t believe the fact I purchased a defective item. Last thing he told me was “I’ve never seen a defective kicker amp out of the box” Then he walked away down the isle but stayed there surveilling me as if I was going to steal something. I never disagreed with him or didn’t anything to cause aggression. Made me feel extremely uncomfortable this whole experience lasted about 5 minutes but it was enough time for them to lose a customer.< /text>

<Review>me and my wife had a very pleasant experience at Best buywinning side met a very nice guy make sure that he will get someone to take care of us I'm in the process of installing some antennas on my home they made an appointment everything went well I was very impressedwe'll see when the guy comes out to my home and does it sting without having Comcast in life I basically want to own my own antennas receivers whatever
because the free market isn't very free out there $10 for this x 12 $10 for this x 12 it never stops I'm just a older guy trying to have some entertainment in my house for my grandkids and my house it shouldn't cost 3 or $400 to have television in your house for the service I'm mad as hell and I won't take it anymore hahaha< /Review></record>

<Text>This is the coziest and quietest Best Buy I have ever visited. These two attributes makes my shopping experience with Best Buy easier and less stressful. They don't have the vast  selection of other stores due to their smaller size however, you should still be able to find what you need.<//Text>< pics>

Last Friday I dropped my phone and broke my screen. Mobile Verizon Expert Jonathan Compian exhibited excellent customer service. He spent over an hour on the phone with my cell phone provider to ensure I received the best deal. Jonathan helped me pick out the blue Samsung S9 plus and the otter box phone case. Thank you Jonathan for assisting me with my new phone! If you need a new phone go see Jonathan!< /Text>

This is the coziest and quietest Best Buy I have ever visited. These two attributes makes my shopping experience with Best Buy easier and less stressful. They don't have the vast  selection of other stores due to their smaller size however, you should still be able to find what you need.</text>

<Text>The staff are always friendly and always available to answer the many questions I have. A few months back on my son's birthday one gentleman personally went the extra mile to help me download a game in the store because I did not have internet at home and it was only available online, he made it possible for me to get the gift my son wanted for his birthday.< /Text><resp>None< /resp>< name>

Bought a dlc or expansion pass for a game. It was suppose to be sent through email but I  didn't receive an email so I went back to the store I originally purchased from. Customer service could not help me and I had to call Best Buys which doesn't make any sense to me. The phone customer service did help me receive the email with code, but why have a Customer service counter?<//review>

If you are convinced that the word "Geek" will automatically ensure a safe transfer of your life's data from one laptop to another, think again. Not only was said "geek" unable to transfer my data, but he/she reformatted my extracted hard drive to be incompatible with a Mac OS System. Mind you, I gave the "geek" this hard drive with a newly purchased Macbook Pro, shiny and brand spankin' new like a baby's bottom.

The past six years of data that was stored on that hard drive is gone. Irreplaceable and unable to be found. Incompatible, as they say, with anything and everything I try to plug it into. Docks and floods and plugs,  you name it.

So, to all of you who are in a rush (as I was) to save yourself and your data, take a breathe, eat a piece of chocolate, and really think about who you are handing your "babies" over to. Not everyone who is shielded by words like "data technician," "total tech support," horn-rimmed glasses and the word "geek" on their name tag is as helpful as you may think.<//Review>

<Text>Looking to buy an Oculus Quest 128GB VR Headset. I'm from Roseville and drove all the way to Natomas because the website said they have it available. I get there and it's sitting there on the shelf, packaged and ready to buy. The guy starts ringing it up and tells me he's not allowed to sell this unit? Says it's a demo unit and that there's probably not even a unit in the box haha Why the hell is it on the shelf, vacuum sealed with a barcode on it? If it's not for sale, put it in the back and take it off the website until you actually have the unit in stock.</Text>< userid>

<Text>I was in line with Geek Squad a little longer than I would have liked. If they would have more than one person working the desk, It would have been a pleasant visit. I got help with what I needed and was pleased with the service once I was done standing in line. I would go back.<//Text>< Name>

<review>Use to come here often back in the day. Nothing really spectacular about this best buy. They occasionally have some good deals for items customers return. BEWARE. Used items look neglected. I've seen some used speakers with a considerable amount of dust on the surface and speaker grills. Can't believe they put that item on display. Couldn't they have at least cleaned it a little?< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x809ad64bc3e77cc3:0x163ce550f2d6f9f9</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<name>Marinel Riya Seifert<//name><text>Maggie/Maggy - the one who answered the phone at this location today, Jan. 18,  you are the reason I am writing this review, still upset and frustrated with your services. I called to ask for help in the status of our order - more than $3k worth of appliances - and all you could say was "there's nothing we can do." I informed you we were told that we needed to switch out the gas dryer for an electric one and your condescending response was, yet again, "there's nothing we can do over the phone. you have to go to the store and make the switch." You really shouldn't be answering phones or talking to customers for a living. Because of your attitude, the tone of the rest of my day left an appalling taste in my mouth.

This part is the delivery and the way this store handled the situation. First of all, their delivery window is noon to 4 pm. 4 hours without any updates received even during the day of the delivery. My account updated the estimated delivery time 30 minutes before they were supposed to arrive - and 3 hours after my husband had already been waiting since noon. I am also disappointed with their status update - calling us at the time of the delivery saying they are still 10-15 minutes out. However,  the third party delivery company was more accommodating than Best Buy ever was. The company at least got back to us and apologized for the inconvenience. Best Buy was just dismissive and this showed their true, upsetting colors - at least the people we talked to at the Natomas store. Truly upsetting and disappointing. If we could cancel this transaction, we would in a heartbeat.<//text><resp>None< /resp><pictures>None<//pictures><Rating>1</Rating>< UserId.>

Went into the store to buy few things. Walked around for a person that works there to help me out, there was none. When finely I saw some one they told me that they were helping other customer and would have some one with me. No one came... after seeing two employees helping one costumes I was frustrated. No one came I waited about 20 mins and just walked out. Service is horrible at this store.< /text>

<Review>Went in 10/11/11 to get a return done, and was in and out quickly. Brian (Product Process Manager) and Customer Service Rep Kristen, were professional, friendly and got me in and out faster than I expected. I was treated with respect and employees were great! Will definitely purchase from here again!< /Review>< name>

The staff were unhelpful and lack the understanding to help me, I had to help them understand my questions. A real chore. They finally told me that they"probably didn't have that item in stock". They didn't bother to check.<//review>

Do not call any store... they have a outbound call system and you will be on hold for over 30 mins.. ( & yes I waited on hold I wanted that pressure cooker for$27) I had a so' so experience when I first walked in the store. I expect to be greeted upon walking in.. "I was not"   strike 1... I found customer service which wasn't hard.. I was greeted by "Shella or Carol"?? I can't remember her name. However she was training a new "CSR" which "I think is excellent, because I was provided with nothing but excellent customer service....Anyhow after placing my order for another amazing deal... I encountered a younger African American lady working in the customer service pick she was very proficient and professional as well. So after waiting 30 mins on hold my in store experience will continue me as a "Best Buy shopper" keep up the great work ladies< /Text>

This Best Buy location is average at best. The location carries very few products and the customer service is ok. I would personally just make the trip to the Arden Best Buy or just call to make sure your product is in stock.</Review>

Ordered an iPad online, went and picked it up 30 minutes later, simple in and out deal, was pretty cool❣️ Also anytime I'm in a Best buy, the people there know there stuff, the area's represent expert knowledge wether it's Computers, Camera's, Televisions, or Home Security 👍👍👍< /review>

< Review>
Went here to buy some items on 9/19/2018.... i asked for help from staff and i was directed from department to department and finally being told the item i was looking for was locked away, ended up getting followed by their sales associates like i was a thief, finally one of their rude employees approached me and i told him what i needed, he directed me to the department for what i was looking for and a bunch of their employees were in a group talking, laughing and horsing around whereby i asked for help and they all started giving off a negative vibe as if i had walked in on them like it was their home and not work, as i was reading off my phone a sku number one of the asian employees made a racist comment and walked away laughing, i waved my hand at him to let him know if he had a problem with me or people from similar background, and he quickly looked away to avoid confrontation, and the associate that was "helping" was a lazy slacker saying they didn't have the product, i told him no as i was just looking at their website and then he finally decided to admit he was wrong. He brought out the item and ringed up the price wrong, i showed him on their website that the item was $64.99 and not $80+. The conclusion is that this natomas store is the worst one I've been to and the experience there is terrible. The staff are unknowledgeable about their own products, racist, rude, mock customers that keep their business running, and will follow you around like you're a thief. I didn't have time to waste on low life racists working at this store by requesting to talk to management as i was in a bit of a rush. I suggest people take their business elsewhere and best buy hire people with courtesy and due respect. I would rate them 0/5 stars but hey its google reviews....<//Review>

I spent 10 mins just to hint down someone to ask a question, just to be told that wasnt his dept and to hold on and he would get the appropriate person. Waited 20 mins and still nobody came. Went to the cell dept because they always have someone there (maybe bigger sales for them?) And again was told I had to wait for the appropriate dept person. He called him over the announcement.

Long story short I left and went to gamestop's to buy my PS4. It was much cheaper at best buy, but at what cost? Basically an hour waiting for a ghost. I will only go to this store If I buy something online and just need to pick it up.<//text>< Pics>

They generally have the items I'm looking for. However, being a smaller store they do not carry everything. While I know a lot of people buy things online, I like to physically hold items, like watches, before buying.</review>

<Text>Best Buy sucks. Over priced and crappy selection. I sometimes come here if I need a specific component for something, but I often end up ordering it online anyway as Best Buy doesn't stock the item or they want some ridiculous price for it.

Absolute bullshit. Spent over 40min on hold with geek squad. Then another 20min trying to make an appointment, then i made an appointment. Got to best buy and was told that noone could do what i made the appintment for. That i had to come in tomorrow.
I am never coming back to best buy or dealing with geek squad again.<//text>

VERY possibly the WORST/HORRID/TERRIBLE experience with dealing with this company/location. The staff is uninformed about the products, disrespectful & condescending towards customers. They also leave customers unattended while chatting with eachother & have no idea what it takes to successfully execute customer service qualities/procedure. I will no longer have any dealings with Best Buy for any reason, EVER!< /review>

Everytime I go seriously I wait no less than 25 minutes for someone to help me, no body walks around around to see if any customer needs a hand or anything they just sit relax and half don't even know there product.

My tower on my PC wasnt loading, everyone else (non-techs) told me try best buy or just buy a new PC but I have thousands of photos of my baby boy that would have been lost had it not been for the GEEK SQUAD!  Dan was my techy guy and he gave me several options for recovering my lost items!! I didnt need a new PC but opted out of saving it since he was able to recover all docs, pics and everything else for under $150! I could not believe it! Now I can save that money I would have used to repair my PC and can get a laptop and port all my pics and things over very easily! Thank you DAN!!< /Review>

I Am very disappointed  with Best buy. We can't trust the prices in Best buy website. If they post low prices  even though they will cancel the orders later without proper reason.< /text>

<review>In January I have purchased a lenovo edge 2 and I was promissed that I would have help with my pc that I could come into best buy and will have free service for my new laptop. Aha. Yeah right. Today I walked into the store and I was turned away becouse I have to $200 minimum for geek squad membership. Horible. I will not recomend shopping here. Go to other stores.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I called to inquire about a cell phone and asked if the cell carrier had any requirements, I was told no.  I told her about my mobility issue, and asked if she was sure, she said yes; only to get there and she was totally wrong.  So, no new cell for me.< /Review>

I'd go here over Frys anyway. I've way too many bad experiences at Frys and needed to stop going there.  This place is so much better.  Customer service is great, products work, and never had an issue returning products here.. Unlike Frys just down the way on Northgate.</review>

i bought brand new ps3 controller here, and when i opend it at my home it was used controller inside and wasnt even working, total rip off.
i went back to best buy to return it, nd there manager (she was lady), she said :- i cant do anything about it and i cant return it, this is how it works here , if you recived product used inside the box its not our fault go through manufactures.
i hate best buy now, this was my first purchase at best buy store .
everybody should open pacaging inside the store if your going to buy something from best buy.
worst experience ever.
NO STARS.< /text>

Still a pretty good store.  Just make sure you check competitor's prices for a price match.< /text>

Rough customer service, and old pricing. Better to search YouTube and tech blogs to help you choose and just buy online.</Text>

The guy who worked at the front who was darker skinned used my laptop so badly just throws it hard on the desk like if he was angry. Then I see other workers that didn't had anything to do with laptop coming and checking my laptop for no reason. NEVER GOING THERE BACK.<//review>< Name>
