John has assisted me throughout my immigration journey, from my initial Green Card application all the way to me successfully applying for US citizenship. I can’t recommend John warmly enough! He has been fantastic start to finish!

John is incredibly responsive, always available via email or phone. There is truly no question “too silly” to ask. Throughout the process I felt like I had John’s full and undivided attention.

John is clearly a master of his craft. Every single step of the application we submitted was easy, fast, and reliable. In between submitting paperwork and waiting to hear back, John always kept me informed.

I truly could not have asked for a better guiding hand in this process!< /Text>

<text>John is probably the best immigration lawyer out there! I applied for a green card under my father's petition and JQK Law Firm helped us through every step of the process. John made everything so much more manageable -helping us stay on top of paper work and making the entire process as easy as it could possibly get. John was incredibly responsive, provided good advice, and always seemed incredibly passionate and genuine about wanting to help his clients. We couldn't have found a better attorney to guide us.<//text><date>1617953358446</date><rate>5</rate></record></dataset><record>

We are an Asian couple immigrating to the US via the employment green card process. My wife and I consulted with John to ensure the next steps we will take with regards to my I-485 application will be lawful coming from a visitor visa. He scheduled a meeting immediately due to the time sensitivity of my case. John was quite helpful and was able to address all our concerns. A tip is to prepare a set of questions for him. We highly recommend the services of JQK Law.

P.S. If you require a detailed review of your document packet you will need to hire John's office for that. But any general questions you have, John should be able to answer.<//review>

<text>John Khosravi is a wonderful attorney. I am a US citizen and my wife is from Vietnam; we were married last year. There were a few wrinkles in our situation that made it a little more complex but he was able to navigate those with ease. We found him to be exceptionally professional, responsive, reasonable, honest, compassionate, knowledgeable and diligent. His expertise in this area is clear and his "bedside manner" is warm and friendly but also professional - the best balance. He was always eager to help and gave us key guidance along the way. My wife now has permanent resident status (green card). The fees were reasonable, especially given the level of service and expertise. We consider this one of the best investments we've ever made and highly recommend him without hesitation.< /text>< pics>

John, has done an excellent job for my naturalization case.
I remember my first meeting with him, he went through all my documents and explain in depth about the process. He was very straight forward.
When ever I had a question, he was very responsive and thorough. He is very organized and he made sure my application is complete and nothing is out of order.
Even before my naturalization interview, I had a meeting with him he made sure I am ready for the interview.
If you are looking for a highly efficient and professional who will provide you guidance for your Naturalization process, look no further.</Text>

My green card case was a little bit complicated, with a J1 waiver involved and I needed a work permit ASAP. During our first consultation, John listed all the possible scenarios and solutions, which was more detailed than the other lawyer we consulted. So we decided to go with him. He didn't let us down. He followed closely with the case, kept track of all the important dates and sent us reminders, and always responded our emails right away. He managed to push the EAD card out in like 2 months. And without him reminding us, we might have missed our interview(we didn't expect it scheduled so fast with current situation, so we didn't check our mails frequently). We really appreciate all John's help along the way and we highly recommend him!< /Text>

I can't say enough good things about John Khosravi!  We went to him for a Green Card application after our previous lawyer was unresponsive and John was awesome!  He put us at ease, was very supportive, and prepared us really well for a successful result.  Even after the fact he has stayed in touch and has been willing to answer questions whenever they come up.  John is an awesome lawyer and an outstanding person--highly recommended!< /Text>

John is extremely knowledgeable, kind and professional. Where these experiences for a client might be a bit scary or stressful- John really comes through and offers that support and reassurance where you need it-backed up with actual evidence and real life, first hand, wisdom. I couldn't ask for more- being someone who worked with other attorneys. I highly recommend you reach out and schedule a consultation---</review>

<review>I cannot say enough good things about John. From our consultation meeting, I knew working with John would be a pleasant experience. He is trustworthy, hardworking, extremely responsive and has excellent work ethics. He is very easy-going, respectful and takes great interest in his clients. John helped me with a marriage-based green card. My husband and I could not be more pleased with the outcome in a shorter than expected timeline. He takes great care in his work, addresses your concerns thoroughly and always reassuring. Every step of working with John has been a great experience.< /review>< pictures>

John Khosravi helped me and my daughter to immigrate from Russia via the family reunion process. My mother had filed a petition some time ago and the priority date was coming. At first, I wanted to do everything myself as it seemed that it would be an easy process, but I am glad I changed my mind and got John to help me. The process was stressful because of growing distrust between the US  and Russia and many changes were happening in the immigration policies back then. John was doing a great job keeping me informed and guiding me on the things we needed to do. John would always respond quickly to all my questions. He was very diligent in filling out all the necessary forms. John is very friendly and easy to work with. It was a pleasure working with him. I highly recommend working with JQK Law Firm.<//text>

John is a very thorough professional. He guided us in every step of the process and was always available through emails and calls. He usually responds to our queries within few hours sometimes even few minutes. Our case was far from straightforward and time was very much against us. He helped us stay on top of our case and remained diligent from beginning to end. We are very grateful to have worked with John and recommend anyone going through this process to not go through it alone. It's better to have John by your side.< /text>

<review>I am extremely happy that we chose John to handle our case.  He is bright, attentive, responsive, proactive and —at the risk of sounding trite— actually interested in his clients.  His focus is Marriage-based Immigration. He knows the ins and outs.  His advice was perfect.  Importantly, he handled us thoughtfully.  I recommend John 100%.</review>< Pics>

<Name>AP P</Name><time>1562724805826</time><rate>5< /rate><Review>John has been instrumental in my green card application.

I found him through doing my research online for a US Green Card Attorney and was really impressed by his blogs and specifically his immigration podcasts. Best attorney I could work with and I found him without any personal references.

Since I am based in a different city, John kicked off his professional services by doing a through review of the provided documents and doing a follow up video conferencing, which really provided me a great comfort level. Truly appreciate all his hard work, professionalism and prompt actions here to help me get the green card approved.

The case was more than complicated and wouldn't have been able to do it without his professional help and representation. I am really glad John was able to represent me here and made me really feel comfortable with the whole process and responses.

My case is definitely a great win for John.

John is very knowledgeable, methodical and extremely professional and thorough in his dealings with US immigration matters.

I would recommend John's professional services to anyone going though the US immigration and green card process.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<review>The difference with any business is the level of service you receive as a customer/client and John went well beyond what we had ever expected and we can’t recommend and thank him enough. He guided us throughout the entire process for a spousal green card, responded to emails and phone calls at all hours, is extremely thorough and knowledgeable, and made us feel comfortable to ask any questions. He’s easy to talk to, you can put your full trust in him, and you don’t have to worry about a thing. He will tell you everything you need to know and do, step by step; which will give you peace of mind with these exceedingly complicated, overwhelming and lengthy immigration processes. We recommend him to anyone who is seeking immigration services.

Thank you so much John, we appreciate everything you’ve done for us and we are forever grateful!<//review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
My husband and I were delighted by John's services and felt very lucky to have him guiding us through a rigorous and extremely complex immigration process. As an Australian with a US partner, I wanted to be sure that we spent as short a time as possible apart while waiting for our case to process, and also that everything would be done accurately so that there would be no complications or delays. John advised us of the different options available to us, along with time frames, costs and implications of each, and then worked with us to lodge successful applications for a K1 Fiancee Visa then Green Card. We worked with him for over a year and throughout the whole process he was the epitome of professionalism, responding to all emails promptly, and usually within the hour, and making sure that we were on top of all the steps we needed to go through. He made everything clear and intelligible and never spoke in baffling legalese. We also really appreciated his calm, friendly and approachable demeanor, and felt that we could get in touch with him at any time and ask him anything we weren't sure of. Without John's assistance, this would have been a stressful and bewildering process and we are so grateful to have had him assist us. Thank you very much John!</Review>

It was my first work with Mr. Khosravi and he took care of my naturalization application recently. I’m originally from Iran and have been naturalized since 2014.

I highly recommend JQK Khosravi Law Firm to all the folks looking for a great immigration attorney in LA area. He did an absolutely amazing job for me!

Despite being confident of my case approval, I got my naturalization application incorrectly denied due to alleged absence for more than 6 consecutive months!
Mr. Khosravi immediately initiated communications with USCIS as well as the congressional district office asking for their help to fix this obvious error.  After 3 weeks we succeeded and my application was finally approved.

Mr. Khosravi was very knowledgeable, professional, responsive, patient, and caring.
Feel so happy about my decision to be working with such reliable and smart lawyer. Will definitely keep work with him on my future cases.</review>

John Khosravi is reliable, honest, and trustworthy. I have engaged his services a few times over the past couple of years and he has performed top quality services every time. The first time I worked with John, I expressed the challenges that I was facing, in particular, I wasn’t sure how to navigate the situation that I was dealing with. John assured me that he would walk me through the entire process such that I understood exactly what was happening each step of the way. He took the time to explain all of the legal documents, and gave me the opportunity to reflect and share with him my thoughts about the choices that needed to be made. He acted as my trusted advisor and pretty soon, I was engaging him for a second and third case. Through the work that he does, John demonstrates his commitment to customer services and places his clients as his top priority. He is focused on developing a trusting relationship, while delivering quick and quality services. I highly recommend John!</Text>

Mr. John Q. Khosravi is an outstanding lawyer and clearly one of the best in the field of immigration law, based on our experience. I recently got my Green card approved with John  representing us. His approach was realistic coupled with optimism. We were given the entire, bigger picture, before focusing on the specifics of our case, which gave us a sound understanding of the whole, and confidence in John's  ability to pursue our case. I appreciate him for being approachable, extremely professional and pushing relentlessly for the success of our filing. Personally, I do not feel we could be in better hands. Can't thank him enough. Highly recommended.</Review>

John is truly a passionate, kind, caring and responsive attorney. He helped my mom get her Immigrant Visa and was there for us every step of the way. From gathering all the necessary documents, to getting me into the embassy on her interview day although every body else was refused to enter, to answer our numerus phone calls and emails and finally to get her approval! Please do not hesitate or second guess your decision to allow John Khosravi to represent your family. He never gives you unreal hope. We are so grateful to have chosen him and would recommend him if your looking for a hardworking, ethical and intelligent attorney. I am finally able to sleep worry free, knowing that my mom is coming to live with us:)< /Text>

My family immigration history isn't quite as straightforward as most others', so I came to John earlier this year for a consultation regarding my citizenship process. Since the very beginning of the citizenship journey, John has been immensely helpful, knowledgeable, and responsive. In addition to being a great lawyer professionally, he is an incredible person with a big heart and strong passion for helping people. Due to the success of my first case, he is my lawyer of choice for my second family case coming up as well.

So fortunate we chose John as our lawyer during this heavy weighted and stressful process!

My husband is from Russia and John and his team completed our documentation and paperwork for his his green card (i-485) and travel/work permit. We have been working with John for a few years - our process took exceptionally long due to our several moves which John was with us every step of the way advising if our decisions would be beneficial for our case or not, and of course updating USCIS. We have not had even one unpleasant experience with John. Things to highlight about him are: 1. His quick response time. The previous law office we tried would not get back to our emails for weeks at a time! That was incredibly stressful to us. John, without fail, always responded within the same day we reached out to him with a professional response. This really put as at ease - we really felt he was by our side despite living in NYC and him being in LA! 2. His professionalism. He always returned emails in a professional manner and with fact based info. 3. His turnaround time for submitting paperwork to USCIS - he diligently and attentively reviews documentation and submits it immediately after. 4. He really keeps himself up to date on the latest laws. He emailed us several times on governmental changes.

When you work with John you can be rest assured you are in good hands. You will know you have the best with you at your side!

Thank you, John!< /text>

<text>As a professional athlete I decided to apply for EB-1A visa. From the first conversation with John, I could easily tell that he is highly skilled and educated. Together, we built a pretty strong case over few months and my application got approved in just a few days. John is very knowledgeable and experienced. He cares about his clients and really enjoys his work, but most importantly he communicates well with no delays. 10/10 highly recommended!!!</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Mr. Khosravi is an outstanding Attorney.

He is the most organized and compassionate attorney I have ever hired.

His communication ability is excellent and he will explain every step of the way.  He is very honest and will tell you the truth not what you want to hear.  Mr. Khosravi has been very responsive to my questions with speedy and clear answers.   I will rate the quality of his service exceptional and I truly feel that I got more value for my money I paid him, than I expected.   I highly recommend him and I feel fortunate to have found him to help me with my immigration questions.</text>

It’s been an incredible pleasure to have known and worked with John as our family lawyer for all of our immigration matters during these past three years.  John is incredibly helpful, attentive and responsive, honest, and he truly cares a lot more for building strong professional relationship with his clients than to just doing business.  He has a depth of experience, and his advice is most practical, realistic and reliable. Thank you John, it has been truly a pleasure working with you.<//Review>

My husband and I were referred to John through a close friend, and true to his recommendation, John's service was exceptional. In the beginning, I was anxious to undergo yet another visa-related process that was once again all new to me, but John's professional expertise combined with his warm personality, made my husband and I feel that we were in the right hands. He was there every step of the way and we were truly thankful for John's patience and advice with any questions or concerns we had throughout the process. Everything went smoothly. We highly recommend his services as we feel there couldn't have been a better immigration lawyer to support our case!< /Review>

<text>I met on the phone or in person with 5 lawyers regarding the best visa options for a friend and and John was not only the nicest and most accommodating but also the most straightforward and clear. He's a realist about what can and can't be done and knows his field and laws very well especially in this more uncertain time. He was available for calls, advice and even pep talks! For him it wasn't about the money. You can tell he cares about helping people to make their immigration dreams a reality.< /text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

This is not a review. This is a statement of facts, starting with the fact that John is the most competent and humane immigration attorney that I have ever met, with an unrivaled professional expertise, and ending with the fact that I obtained my green card in a very seamless streamlined process. Highly recommend !!</Text>

He was knowledgable, trustworthy, efficient and so patient and timely with his communications. We hired John to help my father get a green card after being stuck in the process via the H1-B process for over 10 years. He received his card within 4 months and it was painless- Worth every cent.

Moreover, he always stays in touch and guides us through many details regarding the immigration law.

He is knowledgeable, trustworthy and approachable. He asked me for all the documents, kindly reminded me when I left something out, and made the whole process a breeze. No more calling the embassies by myself, no more sending numerous documents to the USCIS. John is a god-sent. If you have an immigration need, call him.

Me and my wife contacted John to handle our green card application and were met by nothing but the best. John turned what seamed like a huge project into a mere inconvenience and before we knew it the whole process was done and I had my green card in hand.

We had John sit in with us during the interview as well which was a good choice. When asked questions about documents or papers we didn't really understand, he would simply jump in and say "That's already done and all the documents are in order and you should have them in your files".

Very simple and very professional and he helped us build a real case instead of just filling in paperwork and hope for the best.</review>

John is a great attorney very knowledgable and very sharp, he helped me and my wife to get our green card , we were asked to attend a second interview for removal of conditions and John put all the documents in order and he was at the interview with us , he explained all the process he was at the appointment 45 minutes earlier waiting for us and we appear 30 minutes earlier, he is very reliable and he cares! He is not one of this guys who are just trying to make money out of you because you need them, he will look carefully in to your case and tell you exactly what you need, he won't look at you as just another case, he will give you the time and attention you deserve, need and will take the stress off your shoulders.
John me and my wife we want to thank you we feel really blessed that you took over our case!<//review>

My Australian husband and I were overwhelmed with the process of obtaining his green card so we searched immigration lawyers in the area and came across many, however, John was the only one who responded promptly to our phone call. He was knowledgeable, very personable and set us on the right track straight away. We've had lots of questions throughout the entire process and he has always been patient and easy to get in touch with, whether it was through email or phone calls. The office is very nice and the staff was professional.
We would highly recommend John to anyone!!!!!!!!!</review>

<Name>Bill Xiang<//Name><Date>1513050554467<//Date><rating>5</rating><Review>I found John after first my first time L-1 visa application failed with an attorney with a "big office", many people work for him! But big attorney doesn't always work out if they don't give you their attention. My first time L-1 visa application was totally a disaster, the attorney himself told me while getting my business that he would take care of it himself. After I paid, he assigned me to his assistant, and his assistant sent me all those "templates" and I believe most of their application docs were just templates by changing applicant's name... and with lots of mistakes!!! And of course that didn't work out. And I feel so luck to find John after the first time failure. He patiently listened to me, what happened, and he spent hours over the phone with me to dig out more info from me and the work&company I'm in. After I decided to go with John, he even personally drove all the way to meet me from LA to orange county, and spent hours knowing me, knowing my company and the operation. What can you expect more from an attorney who really cares about his client. It's not a simple client-attorney relationship, he treats me as friend! I worked with him for my 2nd time try on the L-1 visa application, and I can tell he's totally on it! We would even have phone call at 10 or 11PM at night because of the urgency of my case! And he would work even during weekend to get the process going faster. And from the application letter, I can tell he's really putting a lot of energy and attention to the case, and the letter is definitely NOT template like my previous attorney did. He wrote application letter based on the in depth understanding of my situation by hours of talking over phone, meeting, and emails.
I'm really really happy that my L-1 application got approved with the help of John. I sincerely write up this review to express my great appreciation to John.
John might not own the biggest law office, but John is truly a extremely excellent and great lawyer! And I believe by having the great law operation, he will soon become very very successful in his law operation world too!
Best regards from Bill!
Thank you again!!!<//Review>< Pictures>

I know we had a real fight on our hands, but together we were able to succeed. Cases like yours are the reason why I don\'t want to be in a big law firm or to simply "grow bigger." My Firm\'s policy is quality over quantity. Taking on many cases at once prevents me from dedicating the necessary personal and direct attention my clients require (especially for complicated cases such as L-1s). This personalized and close interaction with my clients is what I value the most about my work and why I got into the immigration field in the first place.

I had a hard time receiving my working authorization and I found John and emailed him, was not expected to get a response so quick (I contacted 4 other attorneys previously, and non of them was as patient as John). John selflessly gave me a lot of great guidance and actually understand what I was going through. Because of him, I finally got my card. I can’t be more grateful for you John< /Text>

<text>I would like to share with everyone my experience of working with John Q. Khosravi from JQK Law Firm - Immigration and Nationality Law.

The first of all, Mr Khosravi was recommended to me by one Russian guy that has already had experience of working with Mr Khosravi. And he was very happy with results: Mr Khosravi has done everything what he promised. More over, he will be doing everything himself personally and you can be assure that your case will be under strong attention of Mr Khosravi. I have also started work with Mr Khosravi and can confirm: he will have done all what he has promised and even more.

With my case Mr Khosravi has got approval of my case without any additional questions although that was not easy case: it was L1 visa and it took quite much work to prepare everything.

Due to some external circumstances I could not use L1 visa approval and I was needed to use family immigration possibility to get green card. But I would like to especially noted that Mr Khosravi still helps me with this case even despite he has no obligations connected to the case.

I would strongly recommend to use service of JQK Law Firm - Immigration and Nationality Law and personally Mr John Q. Khosravi. I can certainly say: your satisfaction is guaranteed.<//text>< Pics>

I called John Khosravi office on April 9th to see if he can help me or at least direct me with my passport issue I have had with LA passport office. Even though my case wasn't something his office typically would deal with, but John was kind enough to listen to my story and referred me two other law firms in east coast that they are specialized in. I really appreciate John's honesty  and integrity. Most lawyers first they want to charge you a consultation fee whether  they can help you or not. I am really thankful to John for his time for that. Even though I didn't use his immigration services this time, but should  I ever need help with any immigration related I would definitely use John Q Khosravi law firm.  Thank you!

John is unusually quick to respond to your questions via email or the phone. He knows all of the "tricks of the trade." He is an expert in every USCIS immigration procedure, and can help you avoid BIG TIME problems that you may not be able to undo.
Honestly, I could not recommend him more. He is incredibly personal and professional. What sticks out the most is how nice of a guy he is.</review>< rating>

<Review>I've been eligible for citizenship for a couple years but had always put it aside since each time I opened up the N-400 I was overwhelmed. I reached out to John based on recommendations from friends and he made taking care of my citizenship paperwork a seamless process. I was really worried that I was going to mess something up on the paperwork when doing it myself so it was great to have someone to help. He caught some really big mistakes on my first pass at the paperwork that I had considered complete, which would've caused a lot of delays and hardship. He really helped simplify the entire process. John definitely knows what he's doing and he's a great person to talk to, I'd strongly recommend him.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< rating>

Mr. Khosravi is an extremely helpful immigration attorney. He is very professional in his approach and has a thorough understanding of all matters related to immigration as well as all the recent developments in the law.</Review>

<response>{'time': 1459986910049, 'text': "Dear Joura,\n\nI am sorry that our interaction resulted in your disappointment. I always appreciate constructive criticism and will do my best to improve my services in the future.\n\nThat said, please note the following:\n\n1)   I receive 15-30 calls per day. Unlike many other attorneys, who may not be personally available to take calls, I make myself available to answer every call to the best of my ability.  I do not use another person to screen my calls and I do not send the calls to voicemail (a tactic allowing professionals to pick and choose who to call back). I'm open and honest in answering calls which unfortunately makes it very difficult to give a full consultation to every person who contacts me.\n\n2)   I am personally and professionally responsible for any legal advice I offer. If any information is incorrect, or if I give an answer that does not address all the facts in your case, I can be sued and held responsible by the California Bar.\n\na.     This means that any time I speak with someone about a legal matter, I must conduct a full consultation, or avoid giving any legal advice. Moreover, my focus is on Immigration Law and I cannot give guidance as to other legal issues.\n\nb.     Depending on the complexity of facts, a legal discussion may take 20 minutes or longer. I also need all copies of the relevant documents before I can make a legal determination.  This is not something that can be accomplished through a quick conversation.\n\nc.     Following each consultation, I take the time to do the following: (1) draft and send a letter to each potential client which summerizes a complete recap of the legal discussion and responses; and (2) conduct follow-ups to obtain updates on the case and to provide further legal consultation in case the law changes.\n\nd.     All of this can easily add up to more than a couple of hours per call. As you can see, with the number of daily calls and emails I receive, I cannot simply provide proper legal guidance to every person that contacts my office.\n\ne.     As much as I try to offer free legal advice, specially through pro-bono clinics, I cannot dedicate all of my office time to free services. I have a business that has financial responsibilities to continue operations and to support my family. It is not fair of you to disregard my responsibilities and try to hurt me with a personal attack.\n\nf.      I take pride in running my business professionally and ethically and I cannot cut any corners, even if in my heart I want to help more people.  I truly care about my clients and I believe this is easily apparent through the numerous client reviews..\n\n3)   I rarely refer clients to other attorneys because I cannot vouch that their work will be to the standards I require. Moreover, if that attorney does not handle the case responsibly, I can potentially be legally at fault for giving a bad referral.\n\n4)   Finally, I ask that you reconsider your last statement.  Even though I was born in Los Angeles, I am proud of my Persian heritage.  I have always made a point to represent both cultures and have acquired proficient Farsi skills in an effort to help my clients.  I find your final statement offensive and unnecessary.\n\nAgain, I appreciate your feedback and regret that I wasn't able to help you in the way you'd liked.  I hope you found the legal help you needed and I request that you reevaluate your review, in particular, your racial statement."}< /response>< review>
Very unprofessional and unpolite not helpful at all, I called him to ask him a question about my situation which was not even an immigeration status case,  he didn't even spend a minute for me to explain me or at least refer me to someone,the reality is that if they don't make money out of you , they will not help you at all. Well this is the Persian style.<//review>

<Resp>{'time': 1493670561447, 'text': "Dear Gurpreet,\n\nI am sorry to see that you had a negative take-away from our phone call. However, I do not understand why that would be and why such a miscommunication occurred.\n\nYou contacted me to discuss a type of immigration case that my office does not handle. I told you to email me so that I can send you a list of other immigration attorneys that could help you. But you proceeded to discuss your case with me again. I reminded you that I do not handle that type of case and could not provide legal guidance, but to email me to get a list of other qualified lawyers that could help. However, you once again asked for my guidance on your specific case (which I don't handle).\n\nThis is like going to a Chinese restaurant and ordering Italian food, then getting angry at the restaurant manager for telling you to go to the Italian Restaurant next door for Italian food.\n\nI just don't understand why you would leave a bad review for me under these circumstances. It is sort of comical.\n\nI hope you are able to find the help that you need."}<//Resp>< GmapID>

<Response>{'time': 1506659552041, 'text': 'Dear Nimool,\n\nThank you for taking the time to review my firm.  It\'s unfortunate that you have prejudged my services since:\n\n1)    You have never been my client.\n2)    You have never had a consultation with my firm.\n\nYou have left several one-star reviews for local immigration attorneys because you had “1 question” that they did not answer. Please note that Immigration questions are not always easy to answer with a simple "Yes" or "No" and require a deep understanding of your specific case and an analysis of the applicable laws and regulations. This is to your benefit and to ensure that the answer you receive is accurate and will not hurt your case.  Personally, I don\'t find this worthy of a 1-star review but I respect your opinion.\n\nI have very high standards for my firm and make sure to address all existing and potential clients personally.  This is the reason why I was probably the only attorney you were able to speak with directly.  I try to take every call and make myself available to the public but this doesn\'t mean that I can offer free phone consultations on the fly.  My clients trust my judgment and work ethic and their trust is reflected through the numerous 5-star reviews of my firm.  Though your review can hurt my overall rating, it will not deter me from helping people to the best of my ability.  Anyone needing immigration help can get a hold of me at (818) 934-1561 and I\'ll be happy to provide assistance within reason.\n\nI wish you luck with your immigration needs.'}< /Response>< gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) When I started this migration way, I was very worried about where to start, and with whom. I met John Khosravi through the Internet, and started. He was awarded with privileges for something like, precision, committed, with Literacy and other things. I am happy to work with him, and if I return to the previous years, I will work with Kiumars Khosravi with full pleasure. Proudly

Fantastic service. The owner gave us a free estimate, and when he was done, they dropped off our car looking like new. Very professional and matched the paint perfectly. He also had his staff detail the car inside and out at no extra charge. Highly recommended!< /Review>

I been going to this place for years, I'm sure they can beat anyone's quote by a long shot. I also manage a fleet of Amazon Prime Van's, and a few of us give our business to Rudy & the Team, Great Job Guys!< /text>

Sacramento Collision Center is hands down the best place if you’re trying to go fix your car, see what’s wrong with it and to see what’s something it might need, this is at the city of Sacramento!

I’ve gotten my car fixed up by different people and places but something always happens so I have to go but I got tired of that so I decided to give this this place a try and man! This place is just fantastic! I got my car fixed here car like 3 months ago and waited to do this review so I could also review the car and oh my god! First of all, the car has been absolutely amazing! They gave me a very good deal and the car itself feels nicer, it evens feels like it drives different by how good fixed it!

Going inside, this gentleman approached me in a very nice way and seemed very happy to help me out and to show me my cars details and what was wrong with it and what he was going to fix and how he was going to do that! Very good at explaining, Thank you!

I absolutely loved the way he expressed himself and I could tell right away he loved what he does and was trying to get the best deal for me and to get my car fixed and back to me as soon as possible !!

I just wanted to say that if you’re looking to fix your car in the city of Sacramento and you’re not thinking of going to Sacramento Collision Center, then you’re just truly not getting your car fixed the right way!

There’s no better place to get your car fixed than Sacramento Collision Center for all you people in the City of Sacramento!

Nothing bad I can say about this place!

Great Service!
Awesome People!
Amazing and Spectacular Way they do their work!

Shout out to the worker there I’m sorry I can’t remember his name but thanks for the great service, he seemed very passionate and you could just tell by the way he expreses himself that he loves his job and what he does on a daily basis!

Loved this place!< /Text>

I’ve had really bad experiences in the past with other collision centers where they have kept my car for almost 2 months. At Sacramento Collision Center you will be treated with respect, with amazing, quality work/service  that you’ll feel like you’re getting back a brand new car!!
Please feel free to stop by if you ever need their service, you won’t be disappointed! That’s why I give them a 5 star review.</text>

A week ago I took my vehicle, that they painted it, because I had color faults and that they fixed some adjustments inside the vehicle, when they called me to go to remove the vehicle it was like new, I did not notice the faults that existed before. In addition the local workers kindly behaved that they deserve their recognition in this comment.
Finally friends I recommend this place has an excellent service 100% reliable if you want to fix your vehicle.< /text>

Excellent service!!🥳 a quality of attention, behavior and especially 5-star presence, they do not need anything, the employees even advise you and recommend some improvements that you can make to your car according to your tastes so that you can improve it and  you like it even more like it happened with me.  The prices are excellent, they leave your car like new, in general everything is very good.  I went to fix my car which is a Mustang 5.0 2017 because it brought strange noises in the engine and when I picked it up it was like new, as if I had just bought it even until modifications I got to do it since they have all the requirements  necessary to provide you with the best service and that suits your needs.  I am from Arizona and I would love for a company like this to be there, they make you treat with confidence and respect by providing you with a great service.  It is an experience of fixing your car very easy, simple and at a very good price, in addition to giving you the confidence you need, I would certainly do it many more times without hesitation!!😁😁</Review>

Excellent service, I wasn't sure which body shop should I go to fix my crashed truck, I heard very good comments about this place and decided to try fixing my truck here.  I could not be more grateful to the personal treatment of all employees, each one made me feel safe that I was in the right place and that I had my truck in good hands.  My truck had two shocks, one in front and one in the back, in the two shocks the truck dropped the paint, so it looked so bad. At the moment they talked to me to tell me that it was all fixed I could not believe it was truck, they left my F150 as new, I will always recommend this place, they provide quality service and great prices.< /Text>

If what you are looking for is to give your car a change, this is the right place, the word professionalism defines this place in its entirety. Starting with the proper treatment they give and of course the excellent quality of work they offer, giving a car a personal style has never been so easy in addition to the fact that prices are accessible and according to what one wants. 100 percent recommended.

I was delighted with the repair and painting work they did on my car.
Without a doubt Sacramento Collision Center is the only company in the area that has the ability to leave the vehicles as new.

They are the best in the market, I took a car to repair and they left it perfect, quality parts until now I have not failed again.  What impressed me most was the treatment I received and how I received the super detailed car, washed and vacuumed, highly recommended if your car failed and you have little money to repair it they are your best option, they fit your budget.  super recommended very punctual and responsible give you the car the day the deal was agreed< /text>

Recently I visited this place and woww is incredible attention and the desire to help you have in the store. When I arrived I thought I was not going to solve my problem because I had visited several places before and it was impossible to fix my car. But they offered me the best price according to my situation and I have no words to describe the moment the car was delivered. I couldn't believe it is completely new. Attention 100% Friendly 100% Understand the customer situation 100% Willing to help you 100% And your work 500%<//Text>

<Review>A few weeks ago, while in Las Vegas for a business trip, I was involved in a car accident and was referred to Sacramento Collision Center by a friend of mine. Since I am not from the area, I needed to find a shop that was reputable but also one that could accommodate my time restraint. So, I called Sacramento Collision Center  and they agreed to see my car immediately for an estimate. The owner of the shop, personally inspected my car and wrote up a detailed quote. He informed me of the extent of my damages and also walked me through the process of getting my car fixed. I was extremely impressed by his willingness to explain what needed to be done, as I was NOT expecting such a thorough breakdown. So, I obviously decided to hire the shop to conduct my repairs. BEST DECISION EVER. In as little as 5 days, the repairs were completed and my car was ready to be picked up. Take note that throughout those few days, I would receive daily updates regarding the repair status. This type of service is unheard of. To be honest, I was speechless when I showed up to pick up my car. It looked better after the repairs were done than prior to my accident. The shop had even washed my car and left it spotless  100% I am beyond satisfied with the OVERALL service of Sacramento Collision Center . The cleanliness and respect of the staff was a huge bonus. I am so lucky that I was referred to this place. I don't know what I would have done if it weren't for these guys! Literally, TWO THUMBS UP!!!<//Review>< Pictures>

It is the best experience I have had in my whole life, I swear today I had a serious accident in the morning and a part of the engine broke down, I was worried because I didn't know what to do so I decided to watch the best online  where to go and I found this place, on the internet I said it was not one of the best here in Sacramento but when I decided because the prices were the best and I realized that this place was the best place in the world to be able to make  a car.  I took him in the morning and when he arrived they could fix the problem in minutes, wow I never imagined how fast they could attend you in such a place.  Thank you Sacramento Collision Center for this great treatment that you gave to my car and for the great experience I had with you and your workers . THAN YOU 💜💜💜💜<//Review>

I had the bad luck of damaging my Camaro. I was recommended this workshop due to the guarantees and the working times they offer ... my car seemed new, the quality of work is very good. What to say about the advice and recommendations they gave me. I thank the COLLISION CENTER workshop for the help and good work they did with my car. I recommend it 100% to users in the quality and timing of the work they do.< /Text>

I think they are the fastest in the city and every time I asked to see progress there were them, it was amazing, really if they have an accident do not hesitate to take it, you will love the work!<//review>< pics>

< Review>
Excellent bodyshop to take your vehicle, I took my BMW 5 Series to this place after an accident, it was a totally different experience that I imagined, this for several reasons:

1.- Repair: I have had the experience that being a BMW always raise the prices and with them were always very transparent at all times and they always showed me the spare parts and their authenticity, I noticed that they use the right tools for the repair and with higher quality (in my view) than in the cart agency itself.

2.- Detailed: It took me a big surprise to receive my car since the quality of the finish was impressive and the cart looked like I had bought it again, the tones of the colors did not contrast at any time and the paint had exactly the same tone as that of the car (even though my car is 2014).

3.- Customer service: They were always giving me the necessary follow-up and resolved my , they really understood the client about the topic of the $ and answer all my concerns that I had regarding the details.

In conclusion i really recommend Sacramento Collision Center, they have an amazing service, time of delivery, quality and work in each of their jobs.</Review>

What a good customer service has the super recommended workshop for family and friends and also for the paint that colored my car was super beautiful that left me speechless, when I saw my vehicle I said WOOOW, and soon we will meet again to make others arrangements,and that the impeccable punctuality, the very good quality, and also the prices are very accessible to an average person, the work of the unique and original mechanics.And another thing that I liked a lot about the mechanics is that they tell you that your vehicle is in good hands and that the vehicle is also 100% safe in the workshop free of thefts etc.
And the workshop is located in a very good area, my respect for the mechanics excellent service.</text>

I drove my car because I had a mishap against another car but as the other car was not sure we went to Sacramento collision center plus we provided a good budget of everything that had been affected his work was excellent painting and detailed as if I would have taken my car again from the agency, I really recommend it, it provides excellent attention.< /Review>

Excellent service very good workers take your vehicle they check it and they give you the diagnosis and what I recommend damages to the damage caused and according to the budget they give you the best options they give warranty time and if you do not like the details they do it again without any cost</Text>

< Review>
Recently I went and visited Sacramento Collision Center Because the painting of my car was very worn a friend recommended this place and I went to visit it the truth is that the work was impeccable besides the attention they gave me was very wonderful and the Price seemed very appropriate
I am happy with the work that these boys did and I want to highly recommend this place because as I said they do a very good job at a very good price and others are located in a very central place for all the public and the facilities are very nice and  Modern
There are several sections to fix several cars at the same time which makes your car not take long to be ready and I liked that a lot
Thank you very much Sacramento Collision Center for everything<//Review>

I had a slight accident with my car and I hit the rear fender which had a bit of paint coming off, I was worried that the paint could not be recovered and that I had to pay too much but since I arrived in the workshop, the people was very kind to me, they gave me a very affordable budget than in other places and I could have my car as a new, I took the opportunity to fix other small details, an incredible place with a high quality service 10 of 5 stars!!!</review>

Although my car was total loss, a guy crashed into the back and I was pressed into a wall, they work wonders left the car better than new and shines more than ever, I reflect on it, I was honestly angry because I thought that  It would not be the same, but being honest, I recommend them, the guy who is attending the entrance is very friendly, from when you arrive until you leave, they offered me service to take me and bring me home, greetings guys keep it up.</text>

A magnificent experience, I found what I was looking for for several years and at a spectacular price, it was worth working hard throughout 2019 to get the changes to my car and start with all of 2020, the employees are very friendly and too quick to do the works<//Review>

I was in a small accident where a woman hit the front right side of my new 2 week old Camaro! Ugh!  I am extremely impressed with the quality of work they did. My car is back to the way it was, as if nothing ever happen! I will not be taking my Maro anywhere else. I totally recommend Sacramento Collision Center to anyone.</Review>

(Translated by Google) Simply the best experience that no other workshop can ever have offered me, I am extremely satisfied since the customer service is probably the best that they have given me in any establishment the workers are very professional and friendly, it shows that they are very prepared for any situation that they are precentered, the work that they leave you is excellent and the truth is that prices could not be more balanced taking into account all the good they do, the word to describe this denied is excellence, keep it up, without a doubt If I have a problem again I will return, without a doubt the best experience :)

Simplemente la mejor experiencia que ningún otro taller jamás me puedo haber ofrecido estoy sumamente satisfecho ya que la atención al cliente es probablemente la mejor que me han dado en cualquier establecimiento los trabajadores son muy profecionales y amables, se nota que están muy preparado para cualquier situación que se les precente, el trabajo que te dejan esta excelente y la verdad es que los precios no podrían estar mas equilibrados tomando en cuenta todo lo bien que lo hacen,la palabra para describir a este negó es excelencia, sigan así, sin duda alguna si vuelvo a tener un problema regresaré, sin lugar a duda la mejor experiencia :)

Simply the best experience that no other workshop can ever have offered me, I am extremely satisfied since the customer service is probably the best that they have given me in any establishment the workers are very professional and friendly, it shows that they are very prepared for any situation  that they are precentered, the work they leave you is excellent and the truth is that prices could not be more balanced taking into account all the good that they do, the word to describe this denied is excellence, keep it up, without a doubt  If I have a problem again I will return, without a doubt the best experience :)< /Text>

DO NOT EAT HERE! I placed an order for dim sum through Postmates in the evening and was given food that was sitting out all day. The dough on the har gow was mushy and the shrimp was fishy. The dough was dried out on some of the other dim sum. Not edible at all and clearly not safe to serve to a customer.< /Text>

AWESOME service and food. The shrimp balls are the bomb!  I buy trays for pot luck events!  Really good Chinese food at really good prices. The fried chicken wings are light, crispy and crunchy without being greasy. Hands down the absolute best egg rolls I've ever eaten.  The fried shu mai is another excellent choice for pot luck and appetizers.</Review>

<Text>We purchase king egg roll every new year, it has become a tradition now, but we normally get it from the story location. This is first time ordered like this much from the Express location. Shrimp balls , teriyaki chicken, and egg rolls were a hit but the fried rice was slimy. Never buy this again.. very sad because it was a party tray which will now be wasted since I am unclear why rice is slimy.< /Text><user_name>Tamekia Chinn<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

I celebrated my PhD this evening in this gorgeous place. Well we enjoyed a fine evening and the place was no doubt one of the reasons for this strong evening. The stuff  cooperated in a lovely manner, the food was extremely good and my guests were extremely  cheerful. We shall definitely visit again for more celebrations. thanks very much.< /Review>

<Review>Great egg rolls! A little on the expensive side for egg rolls but they're worth it because everyone loves the egg rolls from King Egg Roll Express. They even had their driver deliver to my wedding 3 years ago, but now they only use door dash, which is why they only get 4 stars from me now.<//Review>< rating>

To be completely honest, I didn't care for the food.  The employees were nice and the facility was a nice size, clean.
Could improve a bit on flavor.</Review>

<review>Some of the worst customer service I've had in awhile. Rude, short. I asked for teriyaki sauce, and was told no. She threw, literally threw soy sauce in my bag  when I asked for a few more. And rolled her eyes and walked away when I tried to ask a question.  I will not be back. Im so tired of spending $15 - $20 on food to have people act as if they're angry yo have to serve me.<//review>< Response>

<Review>We've gone to this place many times as it's close to home. I really liked the food and it was always fresh and tasty. Portions we're good too!  The last couple of times we went, the portions have gotten progressively smaller. We went again today and it will probably be our last time going there. I got sweet and sour chicken, teriyaki chicken and noodles. We got home and noticed the noodles smelled old and the sweet and sour chicken was overloaded with sauce. I'm thinking so people wouldn't notice how stringy and old the small chicken pieces tasted. The chicken tasted like it had been reheated  several times. I tried calling to see if they would refund me but when I talked to the lady who answered, she seemed unwilling to help me in any way. I used to recommend this place but not anymore.  I'm really bummed because now I have to find another Chinese place.< /Review><Rate>2< /Rate></record>

My review is based solely on their egg rolls. If you're looking for something delicious to bring to a potluck, you cannot go wrong with their egg rolls. Their fried chicken is pretty amazing when fresh as well.< /review>

The 🥚 rolls were delicious! Crunchy, fried to a golden brown color and had lots of vegetables and 🐖 inside. Also, we ordered the fried 🐔 and 🍤. The kids loved the chicken and shrimp, they gave it 2👍!< /Review>< UserId.>

<text>The prices are higher than the Berryessa restaurant.  The reason is that they give larger portions than the Berryessa location.  Only one person was working at the time I went and many people waiting.  The counter person even forgot to give me my Coca-Cola from the fridge and went in the back for several minutes before the cook came out and replenished the egg rolls.   I had to ask him to give me my coke.  They need more people to help serve.  It is also hot inside when hot outside.  No air conditioning or fans.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Worst Chinese food ...EVER. The first sign that should bring up your flags is that it's usually empty and there is a reason for this. The owner/manager uses the cheapest ingredients and waters down all the sauces...with lot's of water. The chicken is always dry and cold...nasty as it could ever be. Most of everything is bland... most likely the owner dictates to the chef to not put so much seasoning or soy sauce into the food. When they make it, it sits forever waiting for customers. I've shared with the owner why this place has very little customers...because of the cheapness of her food. Make great food and they will come. They need Gordon Ramsay's help...straight up. Oh... one last thing, the eggrolls are okay. people seem to be confused...It's Eggroll King that has the best eggrolls...NOT King Eggroll Express.</text>

Took two older “run hard and put away wet” bicycles to them for refurbishment.  Expected a couple of weeks and mega bucks.  One day for one and 1 1/2 days for the other!   Much less expensive than I expected.  They did not try to up-sell me; actually suggested less work based on their assessment. Professional, courteous and competent.  Bikes came out great!  Small shop, so they focus on velocity rather than volume.  Awesome.</Text>

<Text>Took my bike in to have a track cog and lock ring put on, and the owner was rude. Both when I dropped off my bike, and when I picked it up. On top of that, when I was riding to my car, both the cog and lock ring came off. I didn't even make it 50 feet, this shop is an over priced joke.< /Text>< Pics>

I took my son’s bike in this evening for a tune-up and spoke directly with Micah, the owner. Micah told me there was no need for a tune-up, that he could make a few minor adjustments to the bike at no charge. Needless to say, I was highly impressed with his honesty and the way Micah runs his shop;  I will definitely be a lifetime customer and recommend him to anyone who

<Review>Gotta laugh at my last experience. I can tell they deal with some responsive people. When I made a joke about coming back and they were worried I be worried if parts didn't work. I was actually saying about buying more things from there. But I can feel the stress. lol. These guys at this store are great.

Outside of the shop is a nice spot for lunch and to relax after a purchase. Plus they have a very nice team in shop. Again, I appreciate an alternative choice to the other shops that are tourist traps and annoying.

Not Peninsula Bike Works. They are a locals/Base individuals source for bike repair.

Good times always. Can't say enough about this team. Will always be using this shop.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<text>I had an experience similar to Gary's from two weeks ago. One of the front counter guys I interacted with was rather unpleasant and seems to have a chip on his shoulder. I was sold a type of tool that was incompatible with my bicycle (which I rode to the store and showed to the employee at the time of purchase). When I came back to return the tool it was refunded, but I was told in not so many words that I was no longer welcome at the store. Good riddance, I say. Not recommended.<//text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

<text>The guys here are knowledgeable, professional, and very helpful. They're willing to answer maintenance questions regardless of whether you end up DIY or leaving the bike with them. Left both of my bikes with them once, and was amazed by the turnaround time on both occasions. Good prices on both service and parts as well.</text><user>102315121481525032899<//user><Resp>None< /Resp>< rate>

By far the best bike shop in town. The owners are knowledgeable and very nice. I needed help on my Bob stroller, thought I'd give them a shot. They fixed my stroller. I ended up buying a bike from them, and crashed it 2 weeks later. They restored it like new. Very professional!! 5/5 would recommend.<//review>

Been to peninsula bike works once, (during the sea otter classic) and was able to get my wheels trued within 5 minutes. And for a low price at that! I will always come back to this shop now. LOVE THEM!</text>

<Review>Micah and Sean have worked at various bike shops on the peninsula for many years. It was inevitable that they would eventually open there own shop and we locals reap the rewards. Sean is very knowledgeable and works the counter with ease, He has many contacts in the industry. If a part needs to be ordered he will follow up and call you back and let you know the status ASAP. Micah is the guy that can fix anything you throw at him. He's raced many events and can set your bike up for your needs. They are very friendly and easy to talk to. Just ask them and they will help you out the best they can.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response><Name>Kenneth Hodson<//Name><Date>1437068591163< /Date><userid>114442152232382550101<//userid>< gmap_id>

Less than a week later my front derailleur wouldn't shift at all.  It turns out that the cable was broken next to the handle bars-- this should absolutely not be missed during a tune up.
We then looked at my rear derailleur which was shifting, but not smoothly.  the cable was down to one strand and was about to break.

I replaced both cables and tuned it up again.  upshot-- Peninsula Bike Works'  incompetent work was a complete waste of money and time.  I won't go back again.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x808de449f6bb4401:0xd048cdf26a7c971f< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>I believe this is the best bike shop in Monterey for several reasons. 1. They are honest and up front about everything. They disagnose the problems and offer you solutions. 2. They are knowledgeable about everything from road bikes to kids balance bikes and accessories. 3. They are prompt in their service. If it is a small job they mike fix it while you wait, most jobs can be accomplished within 24-48 hours (parts depending).
We will be using them exclusively for the foreseeable future as our kids grow through their bikes. Do yourself and your community a favor and support this local store instead of going to a place like REI.

Menu is somewhat limited to simple basic dishes such as wings, calamari for appetizers, a burger with fries meal and 2 different salads. I think is a bit on the expensive side for such basic dishes. My cesar salad was like 12 bucks and all it had was chopped up romaine, cheese, croutons and dressing (soaked). Besides this the food came quick and the set up was nice...lots and lots of TV screens. Convenient for a simple easy meal if you are staying in house.</Text>

Simply great. Large portions and reasonably priced for Tahoe. Very friendly, helpful and attentive service.
I am shocked that this place is rated so low by others!!
Fabulous evening yesterday. The bartender and the waitress we're exceptional.</text>

<text>Sat there for 10 minutes, no one came over to even ask us what we wanted to drink. A lady came over and asked if we wanted to play trivia, we politely said no thanks. She gave us a dirty look like we offended her. Why would we want to play trivia if we didn’t even order drinks yet? If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Don’t waste your time.</text>< Pics>

<Text>Stayed at the hotel where this pub is located. The ice machine was frozen so the front desk said to ask the bartender to fill my bucket - that they'd be happy to oblige. Couldn't be further from the truth. The bartender looked at me like I was asking for gold nuggets in my bucket and refused my request. Not even one cube. Obviously they couldn't spare a square.

Worst breakfast experience at this place. I ordered crab cake and it felt like it was old and frozen. Also, I informed the waiter that I was pregnant and preferred fully cooked eggs. He brought my food out and the egg was not cooked. So I had to tell him that I cannot eat and he blamed the cook. So he took another 10 minutes to have my eggs cooked. And again the same story. How can you make the same mistake. I ended up not eating eggs at the restaurant because I didn't think they were understanding simple English at this hotel restaurant. And the waiter ended up charging me full price even though both the times the eggs were not fully cooked and it was their mistake. And my husband country side gravy was horrible as well.

And we were there at 7am eating breakfast and people started coming later after we placed the order. But the service was slow. I don't think we'll dine at this place again.<//Text>

<Rating>2< /Rating><Review>I went there for the first time this evening. Fairly unimpressed with the service. The bartender was having a full-on panic attack because 2 people were ordering drinks 40 minutes prior to the closure of the bar. Ultimately, the bar closed 15 minutes prior to 10 pm (the advertised time of closure). I do understand when establishments close early secondary to slow business, however the patio was very much full of patrons and I was not the last to be greeted by a locked door while trying to grab a last call. Overall, not impressed. Highly unlikely I'll try again.<//Review>< Pics>

Service is kind and prompt. The atmosphere is good if you’re looking to eat or drink and watch sports.

It’s apart of the hotel, so we (my wife and I) went there for a meal without a drive.

All that being said, the food was really sub-par for us both. We had a burger and a quesadilla, both were not that well made and didn’t taste all that great.

We stopped and a bar in Wrightwood the night before and the food there was much tastier than Sidelines.

I would just skip this place and go to one of the many awesome dinner spots in Tahoe.</review>

Sidelines--In California, In Lake Tahoe and in 2018 any restaurant should have a reasonably healthy vegetarian option on a menu other than spinach dip or a $14 vegetarian Cobb of romaine, tomatoes, blue cheese and egg.  2 stars and cheers for French fries and wine.</review>

<Text>Brought a friend here on vacation. Were both big football fans. Went to sidelines sports bar. Tried to get the games put on. Bartender said he didnt know how to use the tv and that the lady working doughnut stand had the controllers. Which she did. And her game was already on. When i asked her how to change the channel she replied extremely rudely. First by sayong that we couldnt change HER game off HER tv. And then telling us she was too busy to help us. Ill never come here again. They need a manager to teach customer service. We left and went to pick 6 right down the road and were welcomed like family. They even let us bring our doggie in. Definetely recommend that bar for anyone reading this!! Thank you<//Text>< resp>

I adore this place! They give first-cleass meals, their menu is large, The chef in that restaurant is a specialist, I enjoy very much tasting all their food. The food is consistently of high class, the service towards the clients  is nice. I visit often this place and I not even once was disappointed. Highly recommended.</review>

<Text>I'm usually not too krazy about this type of food that is seating out waiting for you to discover it, but here at China Town Express is so far the only one around tha house that we like, WHY? Because the food is constantly coming out with new freshly cooked trays of food. At times you also have to wait in line because people rather eat here than the Mexican restaurant right next door that seats there empty looking at China Town Express getting busy.< /Text><response>None</response><rating>4< /rating>< UserId.>

I get to eat here a lot since I work right next to it. I love how the customer service is always great and they keep the spot well kept constantly. Rates are affordable and they serve sizeable portions.< /text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>This place has THE BEST ORANGE CHICKEN I've ever had anywhere!
Regular and Spicy.
I always get just the Orange Chicken, no rice. It's best freshly cooked, so usually around opening, lunch and dinner. They give really healthy portions too.
Better than the fanciest Chinese Restaurant! Everyone is always friendly and they remember me. I only get take out. It's small, and I live down the street so it's perfect to take out for me.<//Text>< Pics>

DO NOT EAT HERE!!!
The Cashier who attended me was on her phone and instead of washing her hands after, she immediately started to grab the food and food item! VERY UNACCEPTABLE!! Our phones have so many germs and bacteria!I had to ask her to wash her hands and her idea of washing her hands was to rinse your hands under water for 10 seconds! You shouldn't even have to ask the person handling your food to do that! They should already know! The only reason why I'm really bummed out about this is cause of the WHOLE COVID 19 PANDEMIC GOING ON! This is why things are not getting better! Please care about yourself and the customers! This also refelects on Managment. I used to love eating here, but after today I won't ever be coming back.<//review>

<Text>So, I gave it 3 stars because my fave dish is Orange chicken. But, the chicken tasted like it was microwaved! Very disappointing. I won't be going here again, that's how NOT good the Orange chicken was.< /Text><time>1578438254197<//time>< name>

This is my favorite Chinese food place. The drive is worth it. The food here has a lot of taste. I recommend the broccoli shrimp and the jalapeno shrimp. On the side two veggie eggrolls.<//Review>

Be very careful when coming to eat here. If ur paying with ur card make sure I check ur bank account they have charged. When u go and tell them they refuse to give you the money back.  Won't go back there again..</Text>

<review>They give portions of food based on race, the staff there are really rude and disrespectful they give more food to the customers that appear to be Latino/Hispanic and that is totally not fair but what really takes it too far is when the staff is talking about the customers in Spanish while they are making the plates! I know this to be true because i am of Cuban decent and speak Spanish however i have darker skin and get mistaken for African-American all the time (no big deal to me) but when i went in there with my boyfriend who is African-American and ordered some chicken one of the staff says in Spanish "We don't sell fried chicken here" and the lady who was making out plates busts out laughing. Terrible customer service the food is okay rather blain in  flavor and too greasy, the peas in the rice always have freezer burn and the tables are never clean. It really sucks because back in the day i loved that place now it is not up to par. May be time to reevaluate the staff!< /review>< Pictures>

Con artists: ordered kung pao shrimp the whole thing was just watercress and TWO shrimp. Beware if you are ordering off the menu, they will take advantage of it. It was already expensive for what it was. Never had a takeout place do something so blantaly fradulent. Not only will I never come back to this place, I am going to warn as many people as possble. Hope this place gets shuts down.< /Review>

They place shrimp pan next to fish. Even the shrimp touch the fish pan. I saw customer conplain about it but she said i did not put shrimp on ur container sir... no problem...   after serve that cust... she eat herself lunch  at the corner steam table than serve other customer when they came without wash her hand.  Looks they need go to health classes to get sertification.</Text>

We have bright lighting and security cameras, but the camera does miss some  small areas. We do several property checks everyday, but if RV had been broken into and the doors and windows appeared secured, a visual inspection would not show anything. Again, we're very sorry and we hope that overnight guard will alleviate the problem."}< /resp>

<text>I went to Bear Valley RV to put air in the tires of my trailer 2 weeks ago, only to discover my trailer had been stolen out of this so called secure storage.
On site management was of no help. They did not call Hesperia Police but instead gave me the number to call them. If you have an RV stored there and haven't been there for awhile I recommend you check on it now. At minimum check Google Earth and see if its still there . Google has not updated their view since 3/2020
Bear Valley RV sent me an email reminding me my storage fee is due the 1st of November for my missing trailer. I do not recommend this facility< /text>< name>

{'time': 1603727868600, 'text': "Hi Mike, We're very sorry for the inconvenience. Management is not permitted to contact the police in this type of a situation. This is because the customer moves their vehicles in and out at their own discretion, and it's hard for management to know when they do this. The police will review camera footage of the incident and try to get this solved. Unless you're keeping the unit for a different reason, you will not be charged. Again, we're very sorry and hope the police locate your trailer."}<//response>

Facility has lots of homeless staying in their units and motorhomes on the property.  Our unit had its lock cut half way thru. The regional manager Kim is really rude. They use you phone number as your gate code! You dont get to pick it!</Text>

Not the most modern or prettiest storage facility but the staff could not be more friendly and helpful which far outweighs the lack of beauty. My “stuff” is safe and secure and I have no worries whatever re my things. Plus the location is perfect for me!<//text>

Had my trailer stolen from here 3 weeks ago. Office staff was not interested in helping viewing the cameras videos. Somehow they saw nothing. How does a 30ft trailer disappear? It had a hitch lock so it was not a quick or easy job for the thieves. Very suspicious.<//text>

I have nothing against the office personnel but I do have a beef with the owners. My unit, along with several others was broken into and I was robbed of $350 worth of tools and equipment. The lack of cameras and fairly easy access were certainly contributing factors.</Text>

You might get lucky and your stuff won't get stolen....repeatedly. As in my case. I wish someone told me this before I stored stuff here. My advise is to GO ANYWHERE ELSE if you want to keep your stuff. And make sure u see their cameras working before you store your stuff. This bear valley storage location is tricky.  If you have to use this location, take pictures of EVERYTHING you put in this storage place and record and take pictures of everything and also the serial numbers. Also, have the reciepts you paid for all your items ready to file a claim because they will go into your locked storage space and take what they want. Apparently some people lose track of all the items they put in storage. By the time you figure out you been robbed, it's too late. Don't believe any review in the past 1 and a half years that doesn't reflect this truth. It takes a lot of time and stress to try and prove what was stolen so many people won't take the additional time to write a review.. This place doesn't have active security cameras, the cameras are up but do NOT record anything. They may tell you they work but you will find out they don't when you try to file a claim.They will lie if you ask them because, in my opinion, it is one of (or more than one) worker stealing your things. If any review is over 2 stars, they didn't get their storage unit robbed like the rest of us..< /text>

I have dealt with several different employees at different times at this location. My first encounter to rent a medium size storage was quick and very professional. I later had to transfer into a larger unit and Ms. Nicole made it effortless and pain free. I really appreciated her advice and knowledge about the units.</Text>

Currently dealing with the issue because the gate doesn't allow you to drag a trailer behind you which is not posted on the front of the gate they parked the truck inside the gate where kind of makes it even exiting that much more difficult I said it's because I made the mistake of bringing my trailer in there not knowing that I would not be able to get it out very easily the truck the gate shut on my trailer cause extreme damage to it mind you I just bought just got the trailer out of another storage where I had just purchased it from I just registered it it was stolen the last time I dropped it so I brought it in there thinking that if I just leave it at that to me I wouldn't get stolen I made a mistake on the game got knocked off the track and the lady lost it I try to stay to work it out with her because I didn't have the trailer and sure because I was telling you one and two I mean I was dealing with the hardship so granted I was in the wrong but I mean they won't even work with me on no making it right even though I saw the gate working when I left because the police were got called and even lady want me touching his date figured it out after I showed them how to put it back on the track because I used to work at a storage company that's why I just left my job for me and I dealt with that all the time now I didn't damage the track as hell if I didn't scratch the gate very much couple little scratches and could have been touched a very easily and they're trying to charge me I guess I'm more from 500 to $1,000 to pay in a month or they're going to take all my equipment my quipment is in there and my wood is in there is my business to make the money that they need to pay me that I need to pay them I tried especially then how can we work this out you know I don't think they'd be able to me doing work details or anything like doing windows or something because they don't seem like that attack people they don't even want to let me come back on the property they want my wife to come of all this stuff and they know it's heavy stuff when they should have signed in as Stadium that you cannot pull trailer in there because the the gate shuts that fast behind you which is good in a way I guess but knowing that prior to pulling in there would have been great I don't know in the rules if it says you can't pull trailer in there but you know why I've don't remember reading about that in fact we've never seen people with small trailers come in and out< /text>

Had a great drive up unit. Stored all our extra stuff here so we could sell our house. Then rates went up $75 a month because of street value? Also we had rat poop and pee all over our things. There’s no reimbursement for the rats ruining your things. So I would not recommend this place because of the rats.</Text>

I FREQUENT THIS AWESOME STORAGE FACILITY DAILY FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES AND I CAN'T THANK THE MANAGER, RAQUEL, HER SWEET ASSISTANT, STEPH & MITCHELL ENOUGH FOR THEIR KINDNESS, ACCESSIBILITY & ONGOING SUPPORT.

YOU WON'T FIND A SAFER, MORE WELL MONITORED OR CLEAN PLACE OTHER THAN PREMIER STORAGE.

I HAVE USED SEVERAL DIFFERENT STORAGE COMPANIES, THIS PLACE IS HANDS DOWN THE BEST.

Premier was recommended to me by a close friend.  I just moved to the area.  After shopping around a few places, Premier had the best monthly rate.  I've been a customer for about a month and a half.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The storage unit is easy to access, clean, well-lighted and feels safe.  I especially like the extra wide roll-up door with an indoor unit for easy access.  I've had other indoor units that just have a standard door. I would recommend Premier to others.<//review>

<review>Clean, helpful. Provided a truck free of charge for the move. Units are a bit on the pricier side but honestly, that's what i get for paying for things i am not utilizing to stay idle. The staff is communicative and responsive and the payment options are pretty cool. I don't really trust reviews so you won't trust mine. They do offer a tiny incentive if you leave A review. The never push for it to be a good one. luckily, i leave reviews, anyway. i'm not selling my soul for taxes to be knocked off on one month's rent. so, hopefully that helps you when reading this because you're scouting for a storage company to keep your precious and more than likely unnecessary items safe. It's pretty decent, here. I've recommended this place and i"m doing it now. you're welcome.</review>< Pics>

After dealing with public storage through out my years of moving, I can honestly and thankfully say that Premier Self Storage was a huge help. They stayed late Just for me to use the dolly while moving some very heavy items, they are very detailed when explaining things so you don't leave confused. Enough though I am no longer residing in CA, I recommend this storage location to EVERYONE who needs a storage even if it's only for a few weeks to a few years!
Thank you Premier Self Storage for all your help!

I have been renting a unit there for about 2 years and they have been nothing but helpful and friendly. The units and surrounding area are clean and well maintained and there is easy access to hand carts on premises. The units are well lit in the evening and I feel safe going there when it's dark.< /Review>

I love their climate controlled units. Not only are they great for my storage but I can go there any time and be comfortable while I sort thru my belongings. When I have to go to the unit by myself I feel safe. I liked being able to use my own code for entrance. The staff is pleasant and helpful. I wish it were closer to me but the benefits far out way the distance.< /Text>

I recommended this place to someone I know dearly because I, myself have used this place when they first ever opened many years ago. I am amazed on how well this place has been kept up. I give the service gal Lawreisha an A+ for her customer service! It’s hard to find great service anymore anywhere!  Keep up the good work premier storage!!< /review>

The units are clean and well taken care of.

I'm so happy with the customer service that I have received at Premier Self Storage.  The ladies in the office made my move so easy.

Property was so clean and very lit so I felt safe moving in when it's dark.

It's hard to find great customer service these days.<//Text>

Don't let the name fool you, the place has gone down hill since they opened. If I could give them ZERO stars I would . Not limited to these issues...no toilet paper in the bathrooms and they lock up all the carts, additionally,  I notified them about  people staying in units overnight and they did nothing about it! The reason they have so many reviews is because they offer a discount if you add a google review!</review>

<Text>My initial interaction was phenomenal with the first young lady I came into contact with at Premier Self Storage. I made my first review from that encounter but I will have to edit it. She was very friendly and helpful but I must say my last two visits I have felt very uncomfortable with the lady. Not very welcoming AT ALL</Text>< user_name>

I don't want to poo poo the facilities just Raquel Gomez the worker in the office.  One of the wonderful features Premier offers is a moving truck for 4 hours as a promotions for signing up with them.  Great right!!!  My husband called on Monday  8/28/17 to reserve the truck for Thursday 9am the 31st.  He moved more items to the storage today and stopped in to the office to ask a questions and confirm again for tomorrow.  Raquel told him the truck has been reserved for the whole day tomorrow the 31st. Said the lady had just come into the office and reserved it an hour before. HUH!!! We called on Monday and reserved it.. .how can she give it to someone else?  Instead of calling that person that had just come in to tell them the office made a mistake and that the truck had already been reserved she told us we were out of luck.  How can that be???? What part of reserving ahead of time does she not understand???  My husband even showed her proof that he had called and reserved it.  Luckily he had gone in or tomorrow would have been a disaster.  We have people coming from out of town to help with our move which took scheduling on all our parts.  We had to go rent a U-Haul for tomorrow because of Raquel's error.  She was actually the one that took the phone call from my Husband on Monday and she was the one that forgot to right it down and now we are the ones to get screwed by her error.  So sad.  If it wasn't for the fact that we have spent all week moving our things into the 10x30 storage that we rented we would have canceled the whole rental because of this and would have gone with Brentwood Self Storage who we ended up renting the U-Haul from.  If only we had went with them in the first place we wouldn't be in this situation.   NOT HAPPY and this Raquel lady...watch out for her.  She will also over charge you on buying a bundle of boxes.  You are suppose to get a discount if you buy them by the bundle...says right on the boxes but she will charge you by the box and not give the discount.</Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><response>{'time': 1505153076619, 'text': 'Dawn,\n\nWe are sorry for any inconveniences in your experience with us. However, we did make accommodations for you. When your husband called he was just checking in on a few dates, not a specific one, and said he needed to get in touch with the people that were helping you. He said he would call back with a date and never did. This happened twice once with Raquel and another time with another employee. When he had decided on a date and it was no longer available he swore at our employees and demanded the date, we called the other tenant and asked her if she was willing to share the day, she agreed and requested certain hours but he would not take the other hours. We also were willing to give him another nearby date and 2 extra hours for free but would not take that either. As far as the boxes went, our system did not automatically account for the discount, once we caught it we accredited the rest of the balance to your husbands account to make up for it. Again, we apologize for any inconveniences but we have done all we could to make up for it. When the time comes and you need to move out we will give you 6 free hours with the moving truck for the previous hassle.\n\n-Premier Management'}</response>< gmap_id>

They auctioned off my moms storage, and she is in a dementia home, I tried to pay but could not keep up with $300 month. Whoever bought it apparently threw out family memorabilia, moms photo albums with pics of her and dad before I was born, paperwork, my dads Vietnam marines helmet and shoes he got in vietnam..people are ridiculous< /review>

I Usually Always Use Adobe For Vet Care But Unfortunately My Furbaby Needed Immediate Medical Attention So I Was Given The Information For Gridley. I Called And They Put My Romeo In As An Emergency Appt & Are Taking Care Of Him Now.. The Entire Staff Was SO Sweet And Caring I Felt Very Comfortable Leaving My Baby There.. I Will Get Him Back Later This Afternoon..

THANK YOU GRIDLEY VETERINARY HOSPITAL!!!!</Text>< Pictures>

I wouldn't let that money hungry witch ever touch any animal I ever own. I would be arrested if I put my true feelings in print.There is a special place in hell for people like her.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< username>

<Text>They charged my grandma for lab work and they won’t give her the results. She’s called many, many times over the past four weeks, they’ve either been rude or just haven’t even answered the phone. The receptionist said she would mail her the lab results, we never got them.</Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

Great selection of bikes here. Friendly service and an ample knowledge of all their inventory. Would recommend 10/10. Bought a new bike here as well.< /review>

On 6/2 I received a call where I was informed the bike I ordered was no longer in stock, but a smaller frame was available. I was then told that the bike would be shipped out the following day and I should be “on the look out” for an email. On Monday June 7th after numerous phone calls I was finally able to speak to an employee who told me he would reach out to the shipping team regarding my order and I should once again “be on the look out for the shipping email. On June 10th I reached out once again and spoke to another employee (possibly the same one as before) I explained again how I reached out and was told on 2 separate occasions I should receive my shipping email but and was told AGAIN, I should “be on the lookout”. Today is now June 16th and I STILL have not received my shipping email. This is beyond ridiculous as I have been extremely patient as I understand that it is still a pandemic and I am on a different coast. I would just like to either receive my bike or have my money returned to me so I can take my business elsewhere.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

< Review>
Before purchasing a bike through their website, I called with some questions regarding that bike. They answered all my questions no problem. With that being said, I then purchased the bike and it got shipped to my doorstep the very next day. Great customer service, super fast shipping. Will purchase more bikes again from here.<//Review>

<name>Adam De Arcos<//name><review>I have recently purchased a 55cm Golden Cycles fixie bike from mrbikeshop.com. So I got it put together and I was super excited to start riding around my city. I have only taken the bike out on two occasions, and both times I only rode on smooth, even pavement. When I went to go on my third ride, I noticed that my tire was dead flat and discovered a massive crack in my rear wheel ( the crack is causing my tire to leak air). My hopes were to receive a new rear-wheel or at least something to help cover the cost because to simply put it the product failed after two used when it was used exactly how it was intended.
So anyway, I tried calling the store phone number, and immediately got sent to a machine stating "Your call is very important to us and due to high traffic we cannot take it at this time but there's no need to call again as we will quickly return your call." or something along those lines and I left a message with my info and they never got back to me. The next step I took was emailing them with what I had to say and attached pictures and proof of purchase; it has been about a week and still haven't heard back from either the phone call or the email. Tuesday this week, as a last resort I DMed their Instagram page and actually got a response, but since I have explained my situation they have been silent and not respond while being very active in posting Instagram stories and continually posting on their timeline.

Save yourself the time and disappointment and buy your bike from somewhere else. 0/5 for the product and 0/5 for customer service.</review>< GmapID>

<Text>I bought the polished 29 Unknown Curb Stomper based on a good recommendation from another person who purchased the bike from Mr Bike Shop. The shop shipped it promptly. It was delivered to me in reasonable time and good condition. Mr Bike Shop answered my calls and emails. Satisfied customer.<//Text>< pictures>

My friend bought a bike from this company. I wouldn’t recommend them. She has problems communicating with them. I build her bike and found out the pedals were missing. Both rims were damaged from the shipment. I wouldn’t be surprised because the box was damaged. She has been sending them messages and calling them but no luck. I feel bad for her because im the one that send her here to buy her bike. I don’t know how they have 4.5 star rating. 🤔</text>

Mr. BIKESHOP
Bicycle sales and repairs
This establishment has a wide array of bike needs. Although it’s located a little bit far for me it was worth the drive.
My son was very happy with his birthday gift. He selected a blue Elite BMX .He was very excited to have made this purchase. I will return to buy my bike with the basket on the back!
Customer service here is excellent the individuals are willing to answer all of your questions and provide you with information to assist you in making the selection that’s the best fit for you.< /Text>

This has been the most frustrating online purchase experience. The advertisement said they would ship the same day of purchase....didn’t happen. At no point did they contact me to inform me that the package wasn’t going to get to me. They have no idea what’s going on. I emailed them about two weeks later, Mayra said she’d would send a new order that same day and we would get the wheels in 4 business days. She said she would send me another email as soon as she send the wheels that same day....no email. Till today, no email yet. Called them and the guy who answered had no idea what was going on. He told me he would call me back the same day I called, no call. 20 days In, I call back today still no idea. They don’t even know if they have the wheels on stock. If you don’t have the wheels on stock, why would you advertise them with the promise of same day shipping. And yet alone, let the customer order it. I wanted to surprise my son with those wheels for his Bday, and I tried helping small businesses. Now I’m waiting on an email where they are going to let me know if they have the wheels or not. Hopefully I get an email....I want my money back ASAP. This is the worst customer service experience I’ve had. The least you can do is keep your customers informed. Don’t advertise false information. Wrong way to do business.< /Text>

<text>Not sure if in-store service is better, but, online service has LOTS of room for improvement. After submitting a transaction twice for glitches in their checkout service, been NEVER able to reach someone on the phone to confirm the purchase. Have tried for few working days on regular business hours but nothing.

I even tried to email and been days without an answer. Sadly, the reviews online were true, poor customer service.  Hope this reviews motivates a better effort to improve.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

Worst customer service ever. I paid for a bike on April 19th, I still haven’t received my bike or an email updating me. I have called the shop 4 times, sent now 4 emails, and this is my second review. I haven’t received a phone call, email, or anything. I’m at the point I’m going to call my bank and get my money back. Obviously this shop doesn’t care about customer satisfaction.</text>

This is a bicycle shop for people who do not know bicycles. They are way overpriced and their work is not professional. The place is run by kids. The place is for kids. I would not bring a high-end bicycle here for service. Give them your bike at your own risk.<//Review>

Absolutely terrible service. Unprofessional and they lie about the service and repairs they do on the bikes. Be careful and consider going to this place.< /Text>

I put an order in April 9th, so it’s been 2 weeks now I have received no shipping update on my package what so ever, I call everyday no answer, I’ve emailed them multiple times no answer, I spoke to someone yesterday who told me they sent it to fedex & Will Contact me back which was a lie, I called fedex & they said they have not received anything from this store, very unprofessional & I feel like a scam if your ordering online. This is a terrible business & should not be advertising items they cannot fulfill & not even answer the phone regarding your the status of your purchase, they also have my number blocked as I call now & it goes straight to their fake message machine.  DO NOT ORDER / PURCHASE FROM HERE< /Review>

<text>ABSOLUTELY AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE!! Ordered an Unkown 29" bmx a little over 2 weeks ago.  Received the bike pretty promptly which was great considering I live in VA and the shop is in California.  Normally I would go to a local shop to make a purchase like this but considering inventory is lacking everywhere.  After searching the internet for weeks I came across this shop which had bikes in stock. After assembling the wheels, bars and seat I realized the sprocket was moving.  Checked the sprocket bolt to make sure it was tight.  Sprocket was still slipping.  I'm not a bike mechanic but it seemed like something was missing from the whole crank/sprocket/axle assembly.  Sent multiple emails and left multiple voicemails with zero response for over a week.  I did send an Instagram message with a video and explanation of the problem and got s response saying "Could be the bolt holding the sprocket in place. Sometimes it comes a bit loose from factory. That’s why the bike should have been assembled by professionals to ensure everything would be intact." I didnt assemble that part so GTFOH!  After getting the run around I went to a local shop and paid MORE MONEY for them to confirm that a spacer was missing  from the whole setup and fix it.  Mistakes happen.  How you  handle those mistakes speaks volumes about your integrity as a company.  Proceed with caution if you order from Mr. Bikes.</text><user_id>100686635112627917645< /user_id><Name>John Thurston< /Name>< gmapID>

Terrible, buyer beware! Ordered a bike, 4 tubes, a bag and a set of tires. Received the bike, 2 tubes, and the tires (which I had tried to change but never got a response). Never got the bag or 2 of the tubes. Emailed multiple times, tried calling several times a day. Never any response. Had to involve my credit card company. STAY AWAY.<//text>

Not too many people here.  Many unknown, throne and fit bike Co.  To come across.  Friendly greeted and good service. If you want them to do labor work they'll do it for you to and additional 10 charge or if you wanna do it yourself they'll let you borrow they're tools at no cost to you. 😁</review>

<Text>I was looking for a fixie bike specifically and came across this place online. On my way back home after a meeting, I decided to stop by and check the place out. I think I got there around 7pm and they close at 7:30pm. I left around 8:30pm with a brand new bike that they put together for me. Tested it out over the weekend and I could not be happier. I wish I got the guys name, but he was super helpful and really helped me choose the right bike. No sales pitches, no rushing, humble, low key store that has a bike for every price range. I'll be coming back next week for some additional bike stuff I'd like to add.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<review>Company was great when it came to taking my money and getting order out in a timely fashion but when the bike showed up damaged (not their fault) they couldn’t care less about either exchanging it or providing some sort of discount. Reached out a total of 5 times after the initial discussion w/ a representative and not a single response.</review><rate>2<//rate>< user_name>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>Terrible customer service. DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT buy with these guys. That includes buying on the website. Everything on the website is out of stock. Will not ship for months, with or without covid. They will not pick up the phone, they will not return your calls. Best thing to do to get threw is to call repeatedly over and over. I called over 300 times for my order over the span of 100 days. When i would get them on the phone, they would just tell me to call back tomorrow....I canceled my order 3 times with these guys. I know they are the best place to get a fixie in LA but just dont do it. Trying to warn others that dont have a spare $800 to be held up for months on end with no hope of getting a return if they wont pick up the phone...<//review>< gmapID>

Outstanding customer service! I visited the bike shop one day before purchasing a bike.  Jimmy answered all my questions and he was very knowledgeable about bike features.

What I appreciate the most is that you can pay with a credit card here. No need to visit a bank to pay with cash like at other places

Absolutely love this place! JR was helpful when I had any questions. I bought my bike from here today, and I'm glad I did. He even cut down the seat and replaced the inner tubes! I will definitely do anything bike related at this place. Great prices too!< /Text>

Best company I have purchased with. I appreciate the service and support I received. I ordered my bike and within 24 hrs, it was shipped. I contacted the store later in the evening and still received assistance, you don’t find that too often so thanks y’all.

Only con is the bike didn’t come with the scan code or instructions. I was able to look it up.< /review>

Placed an order on May 8th. Received an order confirmation, but nothing else.

Sent an e-mail about a week after placing my order to see what the status was. No reply.

Finally called last week and spoke with someone only to be told the bike I ordered was out of stock and my order was cancelled. However, I was informed that they would be getting more in a week and I could “try to place the order again”. Cool.

I’ve been checking the site, but nothing has changed.< /text>

<Gmap_id>0x80c2cc66e1bc12af:0xb8a3deec1fe04b82< /Gmap_id><text>After placing an order on this same model of bike in the color "Summer", a week later I was notified that suddenly the bike was out of stock. It wasn’t out of stock when I ordered it but suddenly it was now. I was disappointed, but they told me they had the bike available in "Misty Blue" and I told them to go ahead and send that one to me. Upon receiving the bike, which was in a LARGE box sitting on my porch after the FedEx guy just dropped it there without notifying me, I opened it up to put it together. There were no assembly instructions to be found. Before you say that I should have taken it to a professional bike mechanic, understand that there is a pandemic and I was pretty confident that I could put it together myself (and it came with tools to assemble it, which implies that you can do it yourself). However, no assembly instructions made this VERY difficult. So I emailed Mr.Bikes and asked if I could have some assembly instructions so I could put my bike together. No response after two days, when they had no problem responding right away when I told them to go ahead and send the bike in a different color. So at that point, I decided to go off of the photo of the bike and common sense and put it together within 3 hours. I must also add that the screw to adjust the seat was too short and had been stripped, so I had to go out and buy a new, longer screw to even be able to ride the bike at my adjusted height. It’s been a week since emailing them for assembly instructions and still no response. But I certainly got an email asking me to review my purchase. I wasn’t planning on it, but since that was so much more important than sending me instructions to assemble the bike that wasn’t even the color I ordered in the first place, here I am, leaving a review. Thanks for the bike Mr. Bikes but also thanks for the most minimal help imaginable. Proceed with caution, to those who are interested in purchasing a bike. These people do this a lot, and worse. Look them up on the Better Business Bureau, you won’t like what you see.<//text><userid>108898452716081782959<//userid>< date>

My bike was flat and had a small leak that I couldn't find. They gave me a very good price and took care of my tire. I got a brand new tube very affordable and fast. Definitely do business with these guys.</Text>

< Review>
I ordered two BMX bikes for my kids and they absolutely love their bikes. I placed my order on 4/15 then got worried that I may not receive my order after reading some of the reviews. I immediately emailed them the next morning to make sure that what I ordered was actually in stock. It took a while to get a response but after sending a few messages and calling, I got a response that one of the bikes wasn't in stock after all. I was able to switch my order order something that was actually in stock and received the bikes on 4/27 to Oregon. As long as you verify that the product you want is in stock, I highly recommend ordering from Mr Bike Shop.</Review>

With the pandemic in New York City, using the Subway is not very safe so I decided to go back riding. After a few days researching I found this website it looked promising. The design of bikes were outstanding for very reasonable prices. Not only that, they are offering “order today, shipping today” or something like that. I was very excited waiting for my bike, I download the app to track my shipment. Everything sounds fantastic.

After a few days (4) I realized the status of my order didn’t change. I call and they said it will be shipped that day... nothing happened. I sent a couple of emails through the weekends with no response. I called on Monday (8 days after my order) and they said they would call me back but they didn’t so I called again.

They promised again it would be sent that day... NOTHING! I called again today (9 days after the order) to find out that the tires that they were waiting for are there but now the frame is missing.

My order got canceled and my refund is pending. Whoever that was dealing with my case couldn’t be bothered to give me any other options so at least I could have had a bike sent to me. I never asked for a discount either a refund. I wanted a bike delivered, in exchange of the money I paid...

No f***s given!<//text>

<Review>My experience with this bike shop makes me feel like I’ve been robbed. We ordered two bikes on the 22nd of April. Almost a month later, and we have not received tracking or confirmation of our order. My bikes are still not here and when you call you get brushed off or there is no answer. This shop is irresponsible and does not take care of its customers. They have more time to post on their social media pages than to give their customers updates. When they finally responded to us all the said was “sorry bro we don’t have your bikes in stock” Unprofessional, zero customer service. If I can rate them a zero I would.< /Review>< Resp>

So terrible!! I bought a bike 10 days ago and I never got a tracking number. I then called the store 7 days ago and they said they had already shipped my bike and was going to arrive today,Thursday April 23rd. I didn’t receive my bike and I called again and the store said my bike is still at the storage. How professional! 👎👎👎 I was so happy to get the bike that I wanted and now forced to cancel my order. I’ll never wait more than 10 days to maybe get a positive answer!< /Review>

<username>Christina Mendez</username><Review>Oh man oh man. This place is awesome! Honest and comprehensive bike maintenance performed. They did a great job reviewing the options for modifying my fixed gear and recommended the cheaper option in the end. Would totally rec to anyone from beginner to experienced. They do not talk down to anyone (I was listening to other conversations with random people walking in). Awesome staff!< /Review><gmapID>0x80c2cc66e1bc12af:0xb8a3deec1fe04b82</gmapID>< Rate>

They build bad bikes. The bike i purchased was horribly built, they ran the brake wire on the inside of the bike, causing it to grind against the tire. The seat was loose...alsmot ate it because it leaned backwards on a bump. The brakes were loose. The inly reason they have good reviews is because they give you fron and rear light's if you give them a 5 star rating....horrible place....dont waste your money here .< /Text>

<review>Placed my order on July 3rd, yes its before a holiday weekend. But on the 6th I am told it will ship the following day. Now, on the 9th, after callong 3 times and emailing 4, I am told they can take up to 5 days from the day it was sent to processing...so 5 days is really atleast 6 or 7 maybe?

I have yet to receive tracking. I hope my parts will be shipping soon. I will most likely not be a returning customer.

Edit: July 17th. My wheelset arrived. All rest of my parts are not showing shipped. This company is not worth giving business too. They also will not answer a phone and give you awful service via email.

Edit: July 18th, other parts of my order were canceled. Company website will show stock but its not, its on back order for atleast 3 week. That would put me over 5 weeks for parts with little to no contact from the company.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

I bought a cruiser, toon it home for a spin and decided it wasn’t for me. They don’t do exchanges or returns, but took care of it. When I came back, the bike I’ve been trying to find for WEEKS had just come into their shop!

They have so much (well deserved) business and are building bikes on site. Actually kind of cool to watch. All of the guys who work here were so cool with all of the patrons even though they were CRAZY busy.

I’ll definitely be back! Coming back soon to get my son one of the BMX bikes.

Also, Kevin and Sergio are the friggin’ bomb!< /text>< pics>

I ordered a fixed gear bike from them on July 3rd . I received the bike on July 8th  when I opened the package I found out the bike was missing a break handle bar I sent various emails letting them know I never received the handle no one has ever responded. I had to call the shop a couple of times finally I got someone to answer on July 10th and was promised that my handle would be shipped out on the following Monday . I am still waiting for my handle and it is now August third . Do yourself a favor don’t buy anything from them. There customer service sucks and all they care about is getting your money .< /review>

Horrible communication, they dont reply any messages, emails, voice mails.

They messed up the order and forgot to send the bike, they over charged the value of the wheels for the customs.

It seemed too good to be true with their social media really well done. You think that they care, but sadly they dont.<//Text>

all the reviews about the shipping are so true bro. I placed an order on June 5th and today is the 19th and I haven’t got details on where the hell my order is. I called on the 17th and they said my one of my items were out of stock and if I wanted a different item. I agreed only because they said my items would arrive Thursday, the 18th, and of course you can guess, they didn’t. So much for “same day shipping, 1-5 business days.” These guys are so full of it and don’t care whatsoever for their customers or their concerns. I suggest going in to buy whatever you need because otherwise they gone rob your money and keep delaying your delivery as it was even shipped out from the shop anyway. Absolutely trash.< /Review>

<review>Ordered my bike Monday. They took the money out of my account.  I emailed after a couple days to inquire about why I hadn’t received a confirmation email.   No response.  So I called.  No answer.  Almost a week later someone texts me and says my moneys refunded and my order is cancelled.  No explanation.  Hoping my money really makes it back into my account.  Bummer.   Not to mention I only ordered here cuz they had the color I wanted.  Now I went back to the other place to order a different color and they’re all sold out.  ☹️</review><Date>1586552499761<//Date><rating>1< /rating>< gmapID>

<Review>I was a little "iffy" at first due to the negative reviews about online ordering. So I called FIRST to make sure the bike I wanted was in stock. The gentleman I spoke to said yes we have about 20. Therefore I ordered my bike and it arrived 5 days later to NYC. No complaints here at all. Thank you 👌🏾</Review><user_id>103252011919669145480< /user_id><time>1589599502356<//time>< Rating>

don't waste your time on them. they won't reply to you. After contacting them, they couldn't get me an update. Unprofessional in my opinion. I will never come back again. They ended up canceling my order still waiting on my refund.< /Review>

<name>Andy Aguero<//name><Review>Worst online buying experience I've ever had. I purchased 2 bikes online, they had them in stock and shipping was 1-5 days. I called 2 days later, they told me my bikes were in the store and would be shipped that same day. One week passes by and nothing. We try calling them, the phone would ring and go to VM. We emailed multiple times, did not get 1 response. We sent them messages through Instagram and nothing. After 3 weeks they responded through Instagram saying yes we shipped your bikes, 30 minutes later, another message saying sorry we don't have your bikes...

How they run a business, I have no idea. The sad thing is I had people reaching out to me after seeing a comment of mines on their post saying they are having the same issues. We all teamed up to get some answers so we began commenting on their social media post. What did they do? DELETE all the comments and still not respond..

If you can't provide at least a bare minimum customer service you should not be in business.<//Review>< rate>

This place is horrible. I purchased a crankset online and their “warehouse” sent the incorrect one. I go in store to try and exchange and they don’t have any. So I return it for a refund and they give me the run around after attempting to reach out multiple times. I have never dealt with such an unprofessional business. Will be contacting BBB to resolve this issue and hold this shop accountable</Review>

$760 Online Order placed on April 20th still has not shipped (May 22nd). We called before ordering to confirm availability and expected shipment times and they said they would ship the next day. They called on April 22nd to confirm our order and we were told they would ship it out on the 23rd. This was the last we heard from them.

Multiple attempts to contact the store have been made since April 30th when the items still had not shipped via email/voicemail/instagram DM have all gone unanswered.

If it is a matter of them being out of stock on the item, I would be okay with that,  but it needs to be communicated in a timely manner to the consumer. I withheld the negative review for 3 weeks to give the company time to respond to my multiple attempts during the pandemic as I understand things are different right now.

Please advise.< /Text>

This place has the worse customer service ever. I paid 50 dollars to fix my bike just to get a flat tire the next day They weren't trying to help me out, they wanted to charge me more money on top of that just to fix it again. I think they rigged my bike on purpose it just doesn't make sense and they have attitude like it's my fault for their poor quality materials and service. I don't recommend this place to any of my biker friends who live in the area. In fact I'm telling everyone this business is the worse. The employee with the green eyes has no respect.< /Text>

Came inside, right away got offered help by Sergio in helping me find the first bike I ever got, great service for first time and really helped me out by recommending me what type of bike I got. Quick and friendly service from workers, they really know how to attend a customer. Most definitely would come for future purposes and as well recomend anyone to get their bike here!!</Review>

<Text>Don’t buy from this place if you don’t want to lose your money! I made an order months ago and never received my order, tried to communicate with them via email with no response from them, then I tried to communicate with them via Instagram and it has been almost impossible to get a response from them. They even told me they were going to block me if I kept talking to them. After realizing that I would never get my order I cancelled it and weeks later they send me an email that said that I would get a refund... well, that was a lie. I lost almost 600€.</Text><Response>None</Response>< time>

<text>This place scammed me for almost $600. Revived a confirmation on my order which said I would be notified when the bike was shipped out. I never received a shipping confirmation. I called to see what the issue was and they told my some bs that they were waiting for my wheel set to come in. This was about a month in. I sent numerous emails and got not reply. Each time I called they gave me the same bs answer until they eventually stopped answering any of my phone calls. All of this happened over the span of 5 months. Eventually I had to file a dispute with my bank to try and get my money back. DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM THIS PLACE, THEY WILL SCAM YOU.<//text>< Pics>

I paid 50 dollars to fix my bike just to get a flat tire the next day They weren't trying to help me out, they wanted to charge me more money on top of that just to fix it again. I think they rigged my bike on purpose it just doesn't make sense and they have attitude like it's my fault for their poor quality materials and service. I don't recommend this place to any of my biker friends who live in the area. In fact I'm telling everyone this business is the worse.

<text>Came inside, right away got offered help by Sergio in helping me find the first bike I ever got, great service for first time and really helped me out by recommending me what type of bike I got. Quick and friendly service from workers, they really know how to attend a customer. Most definitely would come for future purposes and as well recomend anyone to get their bike here!!</text>< pictures>

<Text>Love this shop, I have a couple bike stores closer to my home in downtown LA but I keep coming here. They have a good selection of Fixed Gear bikes and parts plus you can't beat their prices. I've already purchased my second bike from them. They gave me a $25 student discount. Thanks Mr. Bikes!< /Text>< Name>

< Review>
Like many other reviewers before me, I had a less than ideal experience with Mr. Bike Shop. I purchased a bike online on 4/10/19 and I promptly got an email confirmation of the order. The email said a notification would be sent when the bike ships and thus, I waited. About a week later, I hadn't heard anything so I called, but only got voicemail. Another few days went by so I called and emailed, no response. I probably called a dozen times over a dozen days and heard not a peep back. On 4/22/19, they sent an email saying the order was cancelled without any sort of explanation. Maybe their in-person retail experience is different, but their online presence leave much to be desired.</Review>

I’m not sure who helped me but he was amazing! They didn’t have my exact order so he called me and built me something better plus it was delivered 2 days later and to it surprise he sent a few extras for the inconvenience. I will be a returning customer. Thank you!!!!<//text>

ABSOLUTE ONLINE SCAM!!!

I didn't listen to the other reviews and had faith I would receive my order with no problem.  After 141 days (and counting) I have not received a bike or a refund.  I am now going through the process of trying to recover my money.

If you think calling helps it doesn't, the only way to get a response is to call back to back like a psycho ex-girlfriend.  Even then you'll get an earful of lies and zero action.

DO NOT TRUST THIS BUSINESS WITH YOUR MONEY<//Review>

Someone suggested this shop so I made a 2 hour drive to see the hype. Raymond the shop owner did solid work with a super clean Throne bike! Definitely worth the trip.< /review>

Ordered my fixie parts half a month ago, they didn’t tell me it would be delayed. I emailed a week later they said it would go out that day... that was a week ago. I called twice this week and both days they said it would go out. It hasn’t. Thinking of filing a fraud dispute by next week because this seems like a scam

The saga continues! They shipped an order that wasn’t what I ordered. They took a box and wrote the color I ordered on it and sent a different color and different type of wheel... they haven’t shipped my seat or crank set. Filed a fraud report and left them a voicemail with those details, only then have I heard back. They still haven’t given me a shipping label to return their wheels. So if you don’t have your things call your credit card company and file a fraud report!! Don’t wait more than 30 days though</Text>

<review>Exellent shop, great customer service, brilliant location. This bike shop has it all, it's well stocked. I had been wanting to visit them for a while now. I came to visit family and I just had to stop! I bought a bike that I really liked, the salesperson was courteous and professional. I will be taking my bike back with me to Chicago.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Ordered online weeks ago for my sons 10th birthday. Disappointed little boy with no present arriving. Have sent emails, tried calling and now have American authorities looking to follow up. Appears they are already under investigation.
Spent over $600 New Zealand dollars and received nothing.
Absolutely appalling service. FRAUDSTERS.
DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS SHOP.</review>

Someone suggested this shop so I made a 2 hour drive to see the hype. Raymond the shop owner did solid work with a super clean Throne bike! Definitely worth the trip.<//Text>

<review>ABSOLUTE ONLINE SCAM!!!

I didn't listen to the other reviews and had faith I would receive my order with no problem.  After 141 days (and counting) I have not received a bike or a refund.  I am now going through the process of trying to recover my money.

If you think calling helps it doesn't, the only way to get a response is to call back to back like a psycho ex-girlfriend.  Even then you'll get an earful of lies and zero action.

DO NOT TRUST THIS BUSINESS WITH YOUR MONEY< /review><time>1568657998818</time>< user_id>

Placed an order on December 16th 2019 received order promptly but received an damaged frame, I contacted the vendor at mrbikes spoke to Raymond and Myra both via email and call shop multiple times. I was told they would file a claim with FedEx. It is now January 17th 2020 and at this point I paid full price for a dented frame. I will not do business with this company due to the issue I had and they have not steped up to makeit right, bottom line paid full price for a bent or dented frame.</review>

Cool Shop! I wish I had a Mr. Bikes in my city. I got my Throne Track Bike in 8 Days not bad it was really well packaged so no issues during transit (Thank God ;) I previously ordered some bars from a different vendor and received them dented and scratched (packaging sucked). So I really appreciate the time and effort they took to make sure my bike was secure enough to have a safe travel :). It was super easy to assemble, I give you guys 10 stars. Thank you! Keep up the fu*&^% good work!</Text>

While they talk about smoking and how high they got. And every time they would look at you standing waiting just to tell you they dont have the part you asked for. A waste of 40 minutes..<//review>< Date>

Didn't want to order from this shop because of the bad reviews but hey this is a small local business not a huge one like the big mike bikes or performance bikes. I'm glad to have ordered my bike from them, especially since they mostly specialize in fixed or single gear bikes. Had it shipped to Berkeley and got my bike at a quick timely manner.<//Review>

If you plan on ordering something from Mr. Bike Shop, expect to receive the item in approximately 2-3 months. You should also expect wheels to be out of true and a fork to arrive 1 month later. If you wish to call and ask about shipping information, you should call about 3 times to actually receive the promised information. The prices are great, but It's a trap.< /text>

Took my son to check out the bike shop, he asked for a Neo Chrome frame colored 20” BMX bike, they just got some new frames in, they found the one he asked for, he got so crazy for just the bare frame that was still in the packaging . They assembled it there on the spot and we purchased it. Got a great price and also got a good lock for it. My son road the bike out the shop and down the street to where we parked are vehicle. Got home, first time I seen him ride a bike the remainder of that day. Thanks MR. Bike shop.< /review>

This place sucks on customer service takes too long to fix your bike and too long of a wait just to realize they don't have what you're looking for then I recommend this place to go fix your bike Stay away from this place<//review>

They have completed there, but still allowed me to pick my own frame, wheels and bars for the same price as the completes. Definitely recommend this place.</Review>

Ordered a bike online from these guys and instantly got a confirmation order but nothing else after that. After not receiving anything after a week I was told by a representative over the phone that my bike was to be shipped out later that day. However it was not. A few days later I pulled up and questioned them as to where my bike was. The guy I believe his name was tony, called someone at their warehouse and said they couldn't seem to find it and they didn't have the white one (Aventon Mataro). But they still sold me the bike. They are known to sell inventory that they don't even have. They take your money and will hold onto it until you go and do something about it. In the store they were able to get me a different and actually more expensive bike at an even exchange. Good customer service in store, but online is sketch. DO NOT ORDER ONLINE. Only reason I got what I paid for is because I am local and was able to pull up on them.</Text>

The costumer service is great, their prices low and have excellent products. Really nice guys here. They didn't pick up my call the first time, so I guess they were busy. But I got a call back immediately right after. They treated me with respect and are really helpful with my questions about my order. For the inconvenience they threw in a free U-lock and lights. That made my day, and I would like THANK THEM!!! I would recommend buying from here. I for sure with in the future :). Hope you like my review!!!< /review>

Basically DON’T LOSE YOUR MONEY on this place, it’s is a big size scam. I ordered one bike with international delivery on 15th January 2019, so I’m waiting 11 MONTHS for it! I’ve been sending dozens of emails asking for either updates, a replacement and since March for a refund but they stopped answering to the emails 3rd of March.<//Text>

They won’t return your phone calls and won’t ship you the bike you paid for or any bike for that matter. I paid them $600 and they never shipped me the bicycle I ordered. Horrible do not get scammed like I did.< /review>

these guys are crooks.  i spent 400$ on an aerospoke.  they never called to mention that they didnt have one in stock, so i called one week later when i received no confirmation or mention that the didnt have one and they offered to send and encore wheel in its place (to their defense aerospokes have been discontinued and was hoping maybe the listing was new old stock).  i received my wheel 3 weeks after ordering and it came with a broken hub.  i called multiple times and emailed them to try and get a replacement under there advertised 7 day return policy and they have not returned calls or emails.  im a working messenger and to lose 400$ is totally not right, i have rent, food etc to mind and thats a lot of money.  DONT EVER ORDER ANYTHING FROM THEM.  i have a carbon fiber paperweight if anyone needs.</Text>

<Text>I originally write a negative comment about my experience, but minutes after I did, I was contacted by the company in hopes to make things right. I'm not going to go into details, but I will say the customer service I received, was a complete turn around. They really made things right and made me happy. The bikes themselves are great, even better than expected actually.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

I live in France and bought a bike on the website. After an email confirmation of the order, nothing else. Is it possible to contact me to know if shipping in France is possible? On the site, the status is: Unfulfilled. Thank you. Aymeric</Text>

I originally wrote a bad review but however a few days later it was getting ready to be shipped and in 6 days it reached my destination which is Singapore. Even though they was almost no customer service i still got what i ordered. Like many other customers i didnt receive any information about my bike for that 1 month the only things i got what a confirmation email and a shipping email. Maybe my frame wasnt in stock and they waited for it to arrive before shipping it out to me. However they could really improve their customers service and there are slight scratches on the bottom of the bike but that fine with me. Thank you for delivering the bike</Text>< Pictures>

My brother bought his bike two weeks ago and now we are back for mine. The crew at Mr.Bikes are very helpful. We called Anthony in advance and he got our bike ready once we got there. We drove from Northridge to here for the great service they offer. Support your local bike shop. This is the place!</Review>

Don' buy from this shop!
I bought a wheelset for my bike half a year ago and still I haven't gotten a respond about the placement of my wheels.
I have tried many times to contact the store but every time I got the a respond from someone they said they where going to contact me and I will get the tracking info soon but half a year as passed and I still didn't get any info or the wheels.
I tried contacting them via the phone and they said that they will contact me very soon.
In conclusion I wouldn't recommend that any one will buy from this store.
( I have added two photos to show that they I have tried to contact them and every time the give me the same respond.</Text>

I placed my order on a Monday morning and spent 2 weeks waiting for the shipping confirmation when their website says 1 to 5 business days for large orders and mine was not large (a wheel set and brake pads....not a whole bike). I called them 4 times during the second week and never got an anseer or response to my messages. I also emailed them a couple times during that week and again no responses. When i finally received shipping confirmation and the date they were supposed to arrive came.....nothing showed up and the tracking was still saying they were in the original destination. Its been a month now and supposedly i am getting my order tomorrow. Not only do they have terrible customer service (i.e. no customer service) but they also charged me separately for shipping when the shipping said free when i placed the order. Im hoping my package arrives in good condition since i cant get a hold of anyone. Definitely never ordering from here again though which is sad because it was highly reccommended to me.</text>

We ordered a bike, but only received the wheels. We tried to get the rest, but got an endless string of promises that they will ship, none of which were kept. Received a tracking number that says "label generated", but nothing has been shipped with that label. Received an e-mail from owner Mayra Mendoza, promising to take care of things, but of course nothing happened. Buy from them at your own risk. I recommend to look at the "Questions asked" on Google and read comments from all the frustrated buyers who don't get their orders after paying for them. I am puzzled that Mr. Bike is  still in business. Sooner or later their business practices will catch up with them.< /Review>

<Text>DO NOT ORDER ONLINE!!! This shop is terrible. My boyfriend ordered bike parts from their online website 5 months ago and has not received them.

I ordered a bike from the website on December 16 2019 and it is now march 6th and my bike never came. They have the worst customer service ever and you need to call them at least 8 times in order for someone to answer your call. never order from this website. NEVER<//Review>

After 4 months of waiting something from mrbike shop and 30 emails, I received an email saying that my order is cancelled and that I will be refund. But as of today, they have not given me back my money. So this shop is a trap and these people steal money from customers. They are planty of complaints than mine. So I tell to everybody who read this email : Never buy anything to this shop because you will be stolen. I have all the evidences of my purchase (order number 6685) and all the emails I sent in order to prove that my bad experience with that shop.

I baught an Aventon in Mrbike Shop the 15th of Janury 2019.
I'm still waiting for my bike. After several weeks I had some information, but still waiting for'it. The shipping is not ready yet. No more information. Only , a tracking  number but USPS says that my package Will  be available when the skipper provides an update or the package is delivered to USPS.....I have ask to the details of the shipping to Mr bike shop, but no answer to my several e mails since the end of January<//text><time>1555651074496< /time></record>

Ordered from them recently when i first emailed them it was great quick to respond to my questions. My order gets confirmed 2 week later without my fork no response by email will probably dispute due to the overwhelming negative reviews the 70 mm wheels that did get shipped out  are pretty  bomb though seems like Company is hit or miss. Good Luck if your going to gamble your time and money on this site .<//Review>

Very helpful staff. They didn't have my size in store so I got help placing the order for local delivery. Since I'm visiting from Sweden this was very helpful. And it only took 2 days. Way to go MrBikeShop!!< /Text>

<rating>4<//rating><Review>alright um. they do have something like problem with online shipping system. Before you order, call them and check if they are in stock,
then u should be fine. but i'm pretty sure it will take about 12days to get it.
and they put some free lights. which costs about 3 bucks for sure but. thanks anyways i'm happy with it(everything is fine with the bike) unlikely other people's review.
and idk if Mr.bike shop did it or Brand did it. they did put free gear, not fixed. it took about 10min to change<//Review>< Pics>

I bought two Fixies for my daughters, they customized them exactly how they wanted while we waited. We are very pleased with our purchase only one problem (parking) but we managed to find one. Thanks Ivan for the great customer service.</text>

I gotta say their worldwide shipping sucks they lack communication I called them so many times about when my bike is coming in and then no answer. It’s been 1 month and it should’ve arrive by now. Why do you guys even bother to do worldwide shipping when you can’t even answer the damn phone or email. And send the package within due date. I even heard that someone haven’t got their bike for 4 months already which I’m starting to get really iffy about. I’m going need to get a refund if my bike won’t come within the next week. This company took a big HUUUUUUGEEEEE L.</text>

Scummers for online orders. Cant attest to their brick n mortor shop but DO NOT order online. Never answer the phone, no return of emails or messages left  but they charge your card. Order 8723. Scammers. You dont take peoples orders who are buying Christmas gifts for their kids and not respond to their email or repeated phone calls for over 2 days.  Wish I had read prior to order placement.

SAVE YOURSELF THE HASSLE.

11/30/18 UPDATE:  I involved the bike manufacturer which actually got me a call back.   I was  cursed at over this google review.  Ramon admitted they did not have the bike on hand even though it was on "sale" on their website.  However, I was charged immediately for my purchase.  He refunded my $$ minus a "25% restock fee".   Apparently, they dont know you have to actually SHIP something and have the customer  RETURN it to RE-STOCK it.  So this is the crux of their scam.  They take your $$, ship nothing, then charge a 25% restock fee.  I will get my $$ back from Visa when I dispute this claim,  but this is fraudulent and shows their unscrupulous online "business" practice.

I wish I had read the 77 and counting 1 star reviews that expose their scam ahead and saved myself all this hassle.<//Text>

<Text>Ordered a frame on 27th of December. Turns out they didn't have it in stock but posted it as being in stock. Then it turns out the factory hadn't even released the frame. After two months of these clowns mucking me about I've requested a refund which they agreed to do. Two weeks after that I've had to dispute the transaction with the bank because they refuse to pull their finger out. If you're thinking about buying a bike from these guys it's be a far better experience to just repeatedly punch yourself in the groin.</Text>< Name>

<review>The worst costumer service ever. Tried to get a part i needed for my bike. Was told by them that it would be in the next day at a specific time and will also call me. Two days later no call. I called and ask if my part was in. They replied.."we got stuff in but gotta check what came in". Third day i called an the same answer was given. I decided to go in person and walked in(keep in mind that the first time i went in the workers were sitting down and on their personal phones doing nothing) one employee was on duty and i asked if he new anything about my part...gave him all the info. All he did was shrugg his shoulders. Employee called the owner and asked if he knew anything about the part. The responce was it was not ordered. I asked the employee what i was told that it would be in the next day. Well he said i just work here. I asked him can i just get my old part back please. He looked for it no were to be found. I ask him to please call his boss and ask if he knew were it was at or pay me the value of my part. He just gave me a business card and said you call him. I just work here. Finally after all the frustration he found it. I will never recommend this lazy good for nothing people and business. Just wondering how in the heck they still in business.<//review>< name>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>Before buying from them online, please know that I had ordered a bike from them that was discontinued months or maybe a year before. I called them about having no shipping updates(because they didnt have it) and he said they’ll have it by the next two weeks.
Please dont go through the hassle that I went through.

For your information, I had just called you guys two days ago.
Shows how reliable they are.

Go back tell them what's wrong and dude tells me if I had come Saturday evening he would have replaced it blah blah. How could I have known if I literally didn't use my bike! So he just tells me he'll sell me another tube and charge to replace it. So  not even a courtesy free of charge replacement, I wouldn't have minded paying for a new tube, but nope this dude didn't care. So much for customer service .

I ordered a bike online over a week ago. It said it was supposed to arrive a few days ago. But now it just says "pending". There aren't any updates, it says it was never even shipped. I keep emailing and calling trying to reach someone and no luck. I just hope this gets resolved and I get my bike .</Text>

<Response>None<//Response><rate>1</rate><review>Probably the worst customer service I've ever experienced. Ordered a bike online from them and it arrived 3 weeks late. When it arrived they didn't include the handlebars, pedals, or grips I also paid for. After calling and sending numerous emails I gave up on trying to recieve the rest of my order and just took the L. Would not reccomend using their online store.</review>< GmapID>

<Text>Before buying from them online, please know that I had ordered a bike from them that was discontinued months or maybe a year before. I called them about having no shipping updates(because they didnt have it) and he said they’ll have it by the next two weeks.
Please dont go through the hassle that I went through.

For your information, I had just called you guys two days ago.
Shows how reliable they are.

terrible experience ahead, no reply, no help, partially refunded. I was trying to acquire a bike but once you have pay, the customer service is inexistent no matter the multiples emails.

1st of all the prices are super high then the owner thinks hes God's gift to the biking world, he gives attitude to most of the customers that I've seen walking into the store including myself and I don't think I'll ever go back to the shop again. If I was getting chased by theives and murderers, and he was the only shop open I would face the thieves and murders instead of going into his store that's how bad it is but don't take my word for it go ahead and check it out for yourself.</Text>

Very disappointed at the fact I have waited over two weeks for a single part to ship from the shop.
I have called and emailed multiple times, reached out on IG and Facebook to no avail.
They essentially have taken $200 from my account and have no idea where my wheels are.

Unfortunate that I had to do a chargeback through my bank just to get my money back.

Take you $ elsewhere</text>

<Review>Awesome shop!! stumbled across them in a Google search and they had a great deal on the frameset I was looking at. Once I ordered the frameset I got the shipment email almost immediately and got my frame from CA to NC in a week even with a holiday weekend in between. Everything was packaged great and in perfect condition! Nothing but a good experience ordering from their website! I would highly recommend them and will definitely be a returning customer.</Review>< Gmap_id>

Go back tell them what's wrong and dude tells me if I had come Saturday evening he would have replaced it blah blah. How could I have known if I literally didn't use my bike! So he just tells me he'll sell me another tube and charge to replace it. So  not even a courtesy free of charge replacement, I wouldn't have minded paying for a new tube, but nope this dude didn't care. So much for customer service . Never again.<//Review>< Pictures>

Best decision I ever made was buying a bike from MrBikeshop. They have such a great customer service and assistance. Every question I had has been answered by them either by the employees or by the owner him self . MrBikeshop has a variety of options on bikes and handle bars including wheels from different color +more. Customer service is beyond the best.<//review>

I've been looking for a specific bike for about a week now and the only place who has it is Mr.Bikes. Drove all the way from Northridge. They assembled my bike on 15 minutes. They were kind enough to offer drop bars instead of riser handlebars free of charge. Customer Service is top notch! Will be purchasing my brothers bike here soon!</Review>< Time>

<rating>5<//rating><text>My wife & I ordered this online for our son on June 17.  We noticed that the confirmation email & receipt did not have any shipping information whatsoever.  There was no shipping date nor any estimated date of arrival or even how many days it would take to get the bike upon ordering.  So we emailed them via their website that same night.  The following day, we called but no one would answer.  It went straight to voicemail.  What was most bothersome was that we just read the bad reviews online after we have already bought the bike.  So we tried calling several times & then emailed a 2nd time.  We were a bit paranoid by then due to the bad reviews we read about their customer service.  Surprisingly & Amazingly, after just half an hour of leaving a voicemail & emailing the 2nd time, we got email replies to both emails we sent from Mayra & we got a call back from Richard.  They provided us with all information & answers to our questions.
It was a wonderful experience because we got the bike exactly a day after we ordered it.  We got the bike on June 19 & it was shipped & packaged well.  I think that most reviews are subjective & I felt I needed to inform the people too that this Company is great & did everything they could to provide a great experience & customer service.  If you read this Mr. Bike, thank you so much!<//text>< Pics>

< Review>
Originally was great customer service.  When I ordered my frame, they were out of my size so upgraded me to the newer frame in my correct size. When my tracking number didn't work, I called and only after I called did they ship my order out.  However, when the package came (after twenty days from my initial order) the frame came in the wrong size and with the wrong wheel set that I ordered.  I've been trying to get in touch and finally got ahold over the phone today.  So far disappointed.< /Review>

{'time': 1507476010774, 'text': "Hi, we can't verify your name since you didn't provide it with your review but we do have 1 Throne Track Lord Neo Chrome Frame order with a chargeback that has been cancelled and refunded. This order was placed on September 9, 2017. On September 10, 2017 we notified you of the ETA of this frame which was currently on pre-order. The ETA was September 22nd, 2017 (7-10 business days) Unfortunately the frame didn't arrive until September 29th (which was a Friday) when we announced it on Social Media. (you can confirm this information directly with the Throne Company) We have been diligently processing all the pre-orders for this very popular frame. On October 5th, 2017 we fulfilled your order which was ready for shipment. On October 6th, 2017 we received a fraudulent chargeback so your order was refunded and cancelled and the shipment was stopped. We deeply apologize about your experience (we hope you can understand) all back-orders/pre-orders with an ETA we provide are directly from the manufacturers."}<//response>

<Review>This company is a con game. I ordered a frame, told it would take 7-10 days because they "didnt have it in stock"& it never came. Thats more than a month ago. I called no answer, sent a email, no response, left a voice mail message, no answer. Once I contacted my card company about the fraud I get a email of a delivery confirmation number a week later only for them to never send the frame. I will let my card company deal with these people hopefully I can get money back but I will be contacting the Throne bike company personally so they know that this is happening with their products. STAY AWAY PEOPLE BUY NOTHING ONLINE FROM THIS COMPANY READ THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS. This is coming from someone who races & would give 0 stars if I could. They may try & call it a scam post but ITS NOT!!<//Review><gmapID>0x80c2cc66e1bc12af:0xb8a3deec1fe04b82< /gmapID></record>

DO NOT BUY BIKE FROM THEIR WEBSITE IF YOU VALUE YOUR TIME!  I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING ANYTHING FROM THIS SITE!
I don't know what took them soooo long to SHIP A BIKE! 14 DAYS! 14 DAYS! 14 DAYS to ship my bike !!!? Plus 6 days of appx shipping time, 20 days altogether, is this how you treat your customers? MrSlowShop get your game up! And they won't pick up the damn phone or reply any email. Extremely disappointed.< /text>

Never written a review in my life. With that said this place is pitiful when it comes to customer service. I ordered my bike May 1st after never hearing back or receiving a tracking number for my order, I was told that they did not have my bike and would have more in two weeks. Two months later they still did not have my desired bike and I requested my second refund. One week removed from my refund request and the funds have yet to be deposited in my account. SAVE YOUR TIME AND YOUR MONEY.<//text>

< Review>
I order a bike from here and when it came in, the frame did have some scratches on it, they were minor, but still prevalent. when the bike came in, it was missing a nut on the front wheels and it took me 2 trips to my local bike store to find a replacement. The handle bars came in with grease and black spots that i had to wash off. the bike itself is great, i love it. The only thing is, within a week of riding it, i got 2 flat tires, both of which i have had to replace and gotten new, better tires. this site is great for people who want to get the custom bikes, It took me a while before i stumbled apon this site to get the bike i wanted. So it is great that they have the amount of options and combinations to customize the bike. but shipping could use improvement.<//Review>

I came to this bike shop with my son and place a bike on layaway made 3 payments Witch equal 110.00 my son didn’t want the bike after all I call the place and spoke to a guy that made no sence on what he was saying he said he had to contact the owner Witch is his wife.. never got a call back stop by the store to get my refund and he said he spoke to her and I ask what she said he said “ she said Ok” I’m like about what then I told him in my statement I’t don’t say nothing about a contract or not giving my money back it only states 90 day layaway!! Bottom like the guy was a complete Moran he said he was going to call his wife the owner he took long time on the back and came out saying she did not answer and she is not in town she won’t be back till Tuesday by that time I was fuming!! And I told him just give me 100.00 keep the 10.00 he said when you put a deposit we don’t return it back we keep it but we just give store credit so I’m like if some one gave you 200 you will not give it back as store credit believe me people will be acting the same way as me bottom like he did not give me my money back acted like an ass and making up every excuse for everything made me get a scooter that my son is to talk for it!  My point to this is befor you go make sure you get full details and store policy in writing or they will screw you big time!<//Review>

< review>
DO NOT BUY FROM THEIR ONLINE STORE. Absolutely zero customer service for online purchases, they do not respond to any calls or emails and if they respond to your calls they are completely dishonest and seem to know nothing about their own product. There are mixed reviews on here about their online store - I thought I'd give them the benefit of the doubt and give them a go, but that didn't turn out in my favor at all. Spent $500 USD on a bike but thankfully PayPal has my back and I got a refund after I disputed it after waiting 30 days for seemingly nothing; despite when I did get a call from them (coincidentally nearly immediately I filed the PayPal dispute) they said they 'shipped it' 10 days prior to the dispute and gave me a dummy tracking number which showed that the thing hadn't even been picked up by FedEx. The one thing I didn't get back however was the time I wasted trying to even get a response from this 'business'. They seem to have a legit brick and mortar store but their online store is an absolute scam - worst customer service I've ever dealt with hands down. They are that bad they even let the PayPal dispute timeout (i.e. they didn't respond to the dispute in under 10 days) which then means that PayPal automatically refunds the money to me - if that's any indication of how they run their business. If you value your time, don't even bother looking on their website or even going into their physical store for that matter if they treat their physical business the same as their online business. Even if their aim was to scam me out of my money I'd still give them 1 star because they did a pretty pathetic job at that too.<//review>

<Review>Their website is a joke, no confirmation email, no tracking, plus the item was not in stock. If I didn't call like five times, to make sure my order was cancelled, I would have never known. Customer service is not a priority for them which is sad and bad for business.< /Review><rate>1</rate><UserId.>110073950456239202299<//UserId.><Name>George (GHLyta)</Name>< time>

CAN'T GET ANY WORSE ! Ordered a bike online, they charged my credit card , was supposed to received the bike 10 days after, time went by and didn't receive it, then they told me they didn't have it and they were going to credit my card, they didn't !  have to file a dispute with Citibank who gave me a temporary credit.......<//review>

<review>My first experience with this bike shop was very good although the shipping took one week long and they gave me the wrong handlebars. My second experience is absolutely horrible. They don't respond to any of your emails and customer service is pretty bad. It's been 3 weeks and I still haven't received my bike. They even sent an email to rate the second bike I ordered but guess what..... I haven't even received it!! They keep saying it's going to ship out the next day or at the end of the week but it still hasn't been shipped out after another week passes by. Horrible service< /review>< UserId.>

<name>J K<//name><response>None<//response><Text>I received my bike quickly but it came slightly scratched.  Also the lights and tool kit were missing from shipment.  After contacting them I was told it was sent out via usps but when nothing came I reached out again and was given a fedex tracking number.
I just received my second fixie from them.  Customer service was subpar at first but after a phone call with an associate my bike was shipped quickly. Overall I am happy with my purchase. Just wish they wouldn't hadn't  forgotten the lights again. 😒<//Text>< pics>

At 1st I thought Mrbikeshop was not legit because after i made the payment i didnt get any tracking info. But 3 days later i recieved an e-mail from mr.bikes regarding my tracking information and best of all the delivery date was the next day.</Text>

The shipping is too long and they never update the status of the order - I've been calling almost everyday just to know where's the item - they never update me - just that I found out that there's no stock of frame bicycle or at least they will inform the customers that there's no stock at least they will have suggestion an alternate to my order. It's been bad service and lack of communication to their customers at least inform me they email or call me..  until I cancel my order as o don't have time to wait for them. It really sucks ! The service really bad!!!!!< /Text>

<text>Not much of a good place to get assistance on bicycles.  They're not really friendly if you have questions on issues like changing a tube on a tire.  I went in there to purchased a Tube and had to return three times because they did not inform me of the part I needed to put air on a DURO Bicycle Tube.  That was allot of time I spent going back and forth.<//text>< pictures>

I ordered an unknown combat bike 9 days ago and we still haven't got any news from them so we called them and they said they were gonna send us a tracking number and we still didn't get anything and and then they sent me an email cancelling my order saying that they didn't had enough space to proceed my order I recommend to not buy from this place<//Review>

<Text>I ordered a bike on their website 7 days ago and I have not received any news from them. I tried to call them approx. 30 times (no one every picked up) and sent a few emails without receiveing any emails back. The customer service for online orders appears to be horrible... Still waiting for an answer.< /Text><Rating>1< /Rating>< pictures>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I have already made several orders to the web with shipping to Spain and in all, without exception, the communication has been terrible.
Last time I ordered a complete bike and as usual they shipped it in two separate packages. Well, after weeks without receiving news of the second package, I was forced to contact the store, in search of some type of shipping information related to it. Nothing. When they are not interested, they do not take calls, or SMS, or emails, or messages on social networks. They even blocked me.
Finally, and after using all my energy to get in touch with them, they deigned to send the remaining package, which I received, of course, much later than expected at the time of ordering.
In addition, at the time of receiving both packages, I had to take care of the customs amounts (an additional € 37 per package).
It is up to each one to assess whether it is worth risking money in this way to save a few euros.
Good product, lousy service.

(Original)
He hecho ya varios pedidos a la web con envío a España y en todos, sin excepción, la comunicación ha sido pésima.
La última vez pedí una bici completa y, como de costumbre, la enviaron en dos paquetes por separado. Pues bien, tras semanas sin recibir noticia del segundo paquete, me vi obligado a contactar con la tienda, en busca de algún tipo de información de envío relativa al mismo. Nada. Cuando no les interesa, no atienden ni llamadas, ni SMS, ni correos, ni mensajes por redes sociales. Llegaron incluso a bloquearme.
Finalmente y tras emplear toda mi energía en conseguir comunicarme con ellos, se dignaron a enviar el paquete restante, el cual recibí, por supuesto, muchísimo más tarde de lo esperado en el momento de realizar el pedido.
Además, a la hora de recibir ambos paquetes, tuve que hacerme cargo de los importes de aduana (unos 37€ adicionales por paquete).
En mano de cada uno queda valorar si merece la pena arriesgar el dinero de esta manera por ahorrar unos cuántos euros.
Buen producto, pésimo servicio.<//Text>< user_id>

(Translated by Google) I bought a bike more than two months ago and nothing at all. They do not answer the phone or the mail. Fraud

(Translated by Google) Mr.BikeShop is by far the most dubious shop I know so far!
First: The online stock is up to date!
Second: The delivery times are exceeded by far!
Third, the goods will not be shipped in their original box, but will be divided into two boxes!
Fourth: The ordered 6ku bike was delivered with scratches!
Fifth: I have been sent a wrong size!
Sixth, luckily every third email will be answered!
Seventh: After my bike arrived, the people of Mr.BikeShop have shown no response!
These were seven valid reasons not to shop at this unprofessional shop ...

(Original)
Mr.BikeShop ist wohl mit Abstand der unseriöseste Laden den in bis jetzt kennen gelernt habe!
Erstens: Der online abrufbare Lagerbestand ist auf dem letzten Stand!
Zweitens: Die Lieferzeiten werden um Längen überschritten!
Drittens: Die Ware wird nicht im Originalkarton versendet, sondern auf zwei Kartons verteilt!
Viertens: Das bestellte Fahrrad der Marke 6ku wurde mit Kratzern angeliefert!
Fünftens: Mir wurde eine falsche Größe zugesendet!
Sechstens: Es wird mit Glück jede dritte eMail beantwortet!
Siebtens: Nachdem mein Fahrrad angekommen ist, haben die Leute von Mr.BikeShop keine Reaktion gezeigt!
Das waren sieben triftige Gründe NICHT bei diesem unprofessionellem Shop einzukaufen...</text>

{'time': 1557923210445, 'text': "Hello Luis, Thank you for your recent purchase. I located your order for the red saddle and Cult grips. We're sorry you feel this way I see that you did place the order during our 5 de Mayo Sale which can delay small packages but not by 2 weeks as you mentioned (please refer to our shipping FAQ's). I will reach out through email. Thank you. -Mr. Bikes"}<//Response>
