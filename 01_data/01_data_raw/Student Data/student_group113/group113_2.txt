<text>I had a great experience with this location! David was extremely helpful in assisting me with the items I needed for my move and helped me to the car with them. Moving can be stressful and this store was like hitting the easy button. On-site parking and street parking available! Highly recommend!<//text></record></dataset><record>

We rented a truck for in town.  It was a brand new truck.  The move took us most of the day.  I thought the price was very good.  Good customer service.  I would certainly use them again.  Very happy and highly recommend.< /review>

If I could give this place a zero I would. The costumer service is terrible. They just made it so difficult to rent a van. One of the workers made it feel like it was an inconvenience to help me. When you make a reservation here be prepared to deal with impolite and unprofessional staff.</Text>

<text>Money cant buy happiness! Well said. I have never had this horrible experience with any company in my life.
I had reserved a truck one month prior to our moving date. We got a call 18 hours before our reservation start time saying they cant give us our reserved truck. Why, because the messed up and dont have availability any more. My wife and I had the worst week of our lives since we had to settle for a smaller van and move other stuff in our cars. I drove 500+ miles in a week to load/unload our furniture to a safe location. Customer care and on-site staff were not helpful at all (plus they are rude) as they kept asking me to talk to different departments. If our friends and family wouldn't have helped, we were prepared to keep our furniture on the streets.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

U-Haul as a corporation is failing their workers and their customers. I'm sure they're still making a profit of our backs. Every time I've shown up to the Belmont location something has gone wrong. They haven't had the equipment I need, or I put in that I need the equipment for a longer period of time than what they can allow off their website. And just most recently I had a reservation for a storage unit that doesn't exist. What does exist is a third floor storage unit with no elevator. They have also modified their covid-19 barriers for their employees. And common sense shows that they are putting their customers and their employees at greater risk by creating more holes for them to pass the virus back and forth.  Please wear a good mask when you come in to their location.In my opinion, outside of the local workers who seem to be doing the best that they can with what they are given, U-Haul corporation is dirty and they're just trying to make a profit without delivering a product.< /review>

Stay away from this location at all cost!!!!! This location is mismanagement. We booked a 24foot truck 3 weeks ahead, had movers and everyone ready to go for the moving day. I am 8 1/2 weeks pregnant, So we wanted to rent the biggest truck so we only had to do one trip in case if I need to go to the hospital. On the day of the moving they informed us that our truck of 26feet was overbooked and not available. They said all they had left was 1 smaller truck of 20feet,. My husband had no choice but to take that truck since we had the movers and everyone waiting for the move.
While trying to load the truck we noticed there was glue spilled all over the back of the Truck, making it impossible to utilize the whole truck, on top of that the hinch on the ramp was broken. Not only did we ended up taking longer to upload the truck, but we also could not use the whole truck, being afraid that boxes and furniture might get shifted during the move and fall into that glue.
We called the next day to notify the location that we will need the truck another day given the circumstances that they give us a truck that was not operating correctly.
We got charged $436.36 for 2 days. I am now filling a claim and disputing the charges, for this nightmare experience. Stay away from this location at all cost!!! The manager does not know what he is doing.<//text>

STAY AWAY!!! I reserved a uhaul at this location 15 days prior to my move. At 4pm the day before my move (when I was picking up 3 family members who had FLOWN IN to help me move) I got a text saying I can check in for my uhaul rental... to pick up in SOUTH LAKE TAHOE! And yes I check my original reservation and I had selected this location.

Yep, that’s right. They moved my reservation from 2 minutes up the road to four hours from my apartment. I was on hold for over an hour, spent about 3 minutes talking to customer service only to be put back on hold. At this point, I went up to speak to someone in person. The (extremely rude) guy told me that they don’t have a truck for me (even though there were about 30 trucks in the lot) because “all of these have been reserved for in-town moves”. Yeah. Right.

He wouldn’t do anything for us, Scoffed at me when I said I didn’t want to “call this number” because I had been on hold for over an hour. I even offered to bring the truck back after I move (all the way to LA).

So basically we ended up actually driving to SLT (50 was closed so it took 4 hours), got there at 1am, paid $150 for a hotel room, got 5 hours of sleep and then picked up the uhaul and drove another 4 hours back to the Bay Area to start loading and drive to LA same day.

Do not do business with this disgusting company. We will never use uhaul again and will make sure our friends and family don’t either. Companies shouldn’t be able to get away with this scummy behavior. Be better.< /Review>

Literally he refused to turn the ball over on the hitch to fit my truck.  Basically said "figure it out then come get me when you're ready."  Correct me if I'm mistaken but YOU GUYS INSTALL HITCHES FOR A LIVING!!!!

Canceled the trailer and went to UHaul SF and worked with a crew who could not have been nicer.  In an effort to preserve the scare resources that are stars, I'm giving all yours to them.  In fact, if I could save one more, I would.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Dishonest.  I've rented here a dozen times, and the local staff always put 1 extra mile on the odometers when you pick it up.  You can go and complain and they take it off, but they haven't stopped doing it.< /review>

I'm reviewing U-Haul truck rental. My in-town truck rental from Belmont U-Haul was excellent.

I rented a 20 foot truck one day, then a 15 foot truck the following weekend, then a 9 foot van.  Each time, the experience went great.

I was able to use the after-hours truck return system to park and check in the truck using an Android app late at night.  They let me have the truck up to 24 hours for the same one-day price.

There were no unexpected charges during any of my three rentals.

Four stars instead of five because during my first rental, I was new to the whole process and I felt a little bit like the staff was rushing through things and not being 100% patient.  But I understand that customer service is damn hard :)< /Text>

I had a hitch installed at this UHaul, dropped my car off at 7:30am and it still wasn’t ready at 4:30pm. I waited in the store almost two hours before it was ready. Then when I went to another uhaul to pick up the cargo trailer, they said the brake lights weren’t working on the trailer because I’d been sold a bad module with the hitch install. I’m not sure if they didn’t test it after installing or if they just didn’t care that they were selling me a bad part. Not the way I wanted to start my 600 mile move. Would not recommend a hitch install at this location.</Text>

The people at this location were very helpful and provided good customer service. 8:30 pickup on Oct. 1 went smoothly with no wait. The rental van however was dirty on the inside and out with bad liquids in the cup holders from prior users.</Text>

Fellow Burners - DO NOT RENT FROM THIS LOCATION

The van was in good condition and we had no issue during our use of it.

Nevertheless less than 5 min after we returned it on September 5th we were asked if we went to Burning Man by an employee and right after we answered in full honesty we were told we would be charged a clean up fee for a few footsteps on the mat located in the van’s loading area.
Despite the fact that the driver’s cabin and the engine were impeccable, the employees and their manager would not accept to admit that their assessment was exaggerated.
We washed the van for 3 hours using high pressure washer in addition to sprays and cloths to remove the dust. These few footsteps had nothing to do with the playa dust and could have come from any place as it was used to load and unload luggage from other places we went (Reno, Tahoe). I wish I could share pictures but in the rush to catch a plane I missed this opportunity.
While I am ok to argue that these foot steps in the loading area could have been removed, the fact that we faced a zealous employee that admitted she knew from the dates we rented the van that we went to Burning Man to me clearly sounds like this agency is on the lookout for extra cash during the Burning Man season.

We’ve rented multiple times one or 2 Uhauls for Burning Man and it’s the first time this happens despite following the same process every year.

In short we felt we were treated unfairly and we do not recommend this location for Burning Man.< /review>

Terrible - if I could give minus stars I would. Sent here from Redwood City U-haul because they told us this U-haul has storage access until 10pm. It even says 10pm access on their website. We get here at 6.45pm and the staff tell us they'll be closing at 7pm and we can't have access after 7, that there's nothing they can do and their website and colleagues are wrong. A staff member admitted that they could stay but they don't want to go home late. Manager ...useless response 'I'll change the website tomorrow'. President's number no answer. Stuck here with a van full of stuff, 3 cars and nowhere to put it. Thanks u-haul</Text>

<review>It’s amazing how you can ruin a perfectly good business with the wrong staff.

Checked in for a new storage to find the elevator was broken (large truck, big move, multiple staircases make no sense). No big deal, it happens, but no notification was made to let us know, no plan was suggested, no alternatives were noted? The staff offered no solutions and more than that, just didn’t seem to have a clue for us or any of the other interactions happening.</review>< gmapID>

The worst experience in terms of service, also their system does not work had automatic services and made an extra charge of $ 35.00 extra each month and if that were not enough they sent messages that I have to pay when I delivered the warehouse from a month ago. I recommend using other wineries with better service and more economical in bay area.<//Review>

TERRIBLE Experience!!!....WAS OVERCHARGED 26 miles!!!....then spent OVER 1 hour GETTING THE RUNAROUND!!!....SPOKE to 4 Service Representatives ( That's AN Oxymoron) as I Received ZERO in Customer Service!!!.....NO direct phone line to the Belmont Location!!!....just rerouted to the call center!...

I would have been Greater served by Carrying the desk I had to move on MY BACK!!!...rather than dealing with U-Haul & their collective OVER CHARGING & Complete LACK of Customer Service!!!....

Do yourselves a favor in the future....Rent a Burro ...You'll be far MORE satisfied!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ....Mark Joey</review>

<Text>Went to go fill up my propane tank, the guy filling it, was belligerent and harassed us during the our time there to the point where we left, we to this day have no idea why the U-Haul guy was so pissed at us.  How difficult is it to just fill up a propane tank?  How hard is it to not harass customers for 10 min?  As I can see from the reviews my experience was not a anomaly.<//Text>< pictures>

Was offered free storage for 1 month by U-Haul and took the offer. I used the free month and after I moved out. 2 Months later I get a bill for the free month. If you have to use U-haul don't store anything here. I'm still fighting them for over 200 in storage fees and late fees for a storage month I didn't fully use and should have been free<//text>

The customer service here is so poor. The workers are not that bright. They do not know anything about the equipment or accessories they sell in their store. And certainly don't try to get a refill on your camping sized propane canister.<//text>

Solid and efficient service. Car selection isn’t the best - usually will end up with older models that don’t seem to be thoroughly cleaned.</Review>

I had no problems at all reserving a car, picking it up an hour late and returning it at the nearby hotel for after hours. We were in and out in 3 minutes when picking up the vehicle. We did have a tire pressure light that came on when we were just about to leave the city, but this was quickly resolved when we brought it back to the shop. There was an Asian gentleman who helped us out that morning, I didn't catch his name but he was really good.<//Review>< Pics>

What can I say! Great experience checking out the car AND returning he car. Saved lots of money with my AARP card, PLUS Avis was actually cheaper than another rental place I checked out. The guy who helped us get the perfect car, thanks to his recommendation - and, oh, I am glad I followed his advice - his name: Vincent Vega! LOL! Super awesome, friendly, fast, knowledgeable! He gave me a map and helpful details on specific roads to take - highly satisfied and impressed! Thank you, Vincent and Avis!!<//text>

<Text>Seamless and exceeded expectations.  I changed the location of pick up, no problem. We changed the car and upgraded to a convertible, no problem.  Excellent and efficient service at check in and return. Also loved driving the Mustang convertible in Napa Valley! Wine touring in style.<//Text><name>Elizabeth Middleton<//name><response>None<//response>< pics>

Service attendant was very nice and friendly. But there is only ONE person at the front desk. And as far as I can tell, 1 person in the garage. Staff were good but we were held up by too many first timers that had no idea how rentals work! No avis preferred line.</review>

This is the series of events as they occurred:
1.Book a reservation online.
2. Arrive at rental car location with pre-paid reservation by my wife. Customer service representative (Bill/Billy) informs us that her debit card is not a valid form of payment because she is under the age of 25.
3. I proceed to ask if I can put my credit card down as I am over 25, the agent scoffs at us and explains that it has to be her card as the reservation under her name. She was incredibly rude and essentially told us we were straight out of luck.
4. I ask if we can cancel our existing reservation and book a new one under
my name as I have a major credit card and am over 25. The agent responds with "No, that's not possible, we don't have any cars available." She essentially ended the conversation there unwilling to help us out.
5. I proceeded to call customer service to see if anything could be done to book at that location. I was informed that if the status of the location is full, we can't get a car. Period.
6. We have NO way of driving to the wedding.
7. I ask to cancel the reservation.
8.We get charged $100.00 for canceling when we were assured there would be
no fee associated with this cancellation by the desk agent.

A quick cancellation and re-booking would have not only allowed us to go to the wedding, but would also have allowed you to rent a car. I was dumbfounded to find out that your system supposedly makes it impossible to re-book a cancellation. I was also appalled by the lack of sympathy on behalf of your team.

0 stars if I could.< /text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I was very well taken care of in the retreat and the return of the vehicle. Everything went as planned, I made the reservation in Brazil, through Happy Tour, an agency in Salvador. In summary, I only have positive evaluations of the AVIS service - June / 2019.

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>(Translated by Google) No one, never rent from Avis! We ended up with a surcharge that doubled the bill !!! Something that was not specified when pre-booking on the website, I imagine in order to encourage buying, and once you are told on the day that you have to pay again you can not not go the other way .. thieves!

(Original)
Nul, ne louez jamais chez Avis! Nous nous sommes retrouvés avec une surtaxe qui a doublé la facture !!! Chose qui n'était pas précisée lors de la pré-réservation sur le site internet, j'imagine dans le but d'encourager à acheter, et une fois qu'on vous dit le jour j qu'il faut payer encore vous ne pouvez pas faire chemin inverse.. des voleurs !< /review>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) If you are going to return the car, go early, there is no sign on the door or on the wall that this is an AVIS office, only a 50cm sign if it reaches pedestrians, which is impossible to see from the highway. It is a garage door.
Not very well indicated or indicated for tourists.

(Original)
Si vas a devolver el coche ve con tiempo, no hay ningún cartel en la puerta ni en la pared de que eso sea una oficina de AVIS, tan solo un letrero de 50cm si llega a la altura de los peatones que es imposible ver desde la carretera.  Es la puerta de un garaje.
No muy bien indicado ni señalado para turistas.</Text>

Christmas was a bit difficult but I have to say that Exchange Bank’s daily listings of local shops really helped. I called Sandy’s Take and Bake Pizza and gave a gift certificate. Perfect! They were very nice.< /Text>

To be honest this place is a Santa Rosa must! Great pizza, work staff, and the location is wonderful! I’ve been going here since I was a young boy and still believe it is the best pizza in town! Must come and give it a try! You won’t be disappointed!</Text>

Hands down!!!!! The pizza here is da bomb!!!!!  The staff is very friendly and helpful. You can have them cook it for takeout or eat it there or you can cook it at home.  John, the owner has several long time employees who has been there for awhile.  He has really done well with this venture. Try the combo pizza.. you will not regret choosing this or the Hawaiian pizza is also a great choice.  Only downside that I find is they don’t deliver like RoundTable pizza does but cost of Sandy’s pizza is like $10 cheaper than RoundTables pizza.
This is my go to place!</text>

Best take-n-bake pizza you will ever have. Locally owned, in a quaint little shopping center in a beautiful neighborhood. Don't waist your money on any other take n bake pizza.</Text>

Not your average flat pizza. The pizzas are generously packed with tasty ingredients. More expensive than the usual chains, but great flavor and a mountain of toppings, so you get your money's worth.<//text>

Love this place.  The Thai Chicken Pizza is the best.  Friendly people and awesome pizza.  I like baking pizza at home and used to get pies from some of the other take and bake places, but Sandy's is the best and  is definitely worth it.  Happy people making happy pizzas makes me a happy customer!< /review>

Very reasonably priced. It meets the standard for San Diego Mexican. In other words it's good just like a million other places. It takes something special to separate yourself. And although this place is good it's not one of the top tier ones. That said, if you have an urge for a taco shop experience, this place will do just fine!</text>

<review>I've been coming to this taco shop for years. Really good food. They so have some indoor and outdoor dining but I usually order to go and eat at home. They have parking right up front. The carne asada plate is my favorite but the rolled tacos are great too. Highly recommend the green sauce!</review>< Pics>

The best of everything! Service is awesome. Quick and fair prices. I'm obsessed with anything shredded beef(great flavor) and their salsa.<//text>

Arrived at 8:30 Friday night.  Supposed to close at 9 but they said they already started to shut down.  Lame.  Lots of other choices available.</text>

Back in December, a friend and I went here to order some menudo. We looked at it and the tripe was black. I know that that's not normal. Check your menudo when you get it before you leave the restaurant. Tripe should be somewhat white, not BLACK!<//text>

<text>I have eaten here for more 10 years. I love their food,  except lately.  Their burritos have only a fourth of what other taco shops have. Their burritos are all tortilla and no substance. But the rest of their food is good. Just don't buy a burrito!</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Review>I paid and ordered a  carne asada burrito . What I received was rice &  beans and a little carne asada.
If you’re use to getting a lot of meat in your carne asada burrito, don’t go to los amigos Mexican food.   Maybe they should call it “ los amigos rip off of traditional Mexican food “

Or maybe they should call their burrito ,”rice and  bean burrito garnished with  carne asada “

What a huge disappointment !<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>4<//Rate><review>I would give them 5 stars alone simply for their red salsa and breakfast burritos. Unfortunately I've had a similar issue as others. I placed a call at 8:25pm and they refused to answer my call, when I drove by I saw they were still working. Needless to say I was upset but that has been my only bad experience with them. Amazing food and the best salsa I've had. 👍</review>< userid>

Great little taco shop I've been coming to for almost 10 years. Definitely a no frills place with a tiny dining room and no salsa bar. 😕 But, they give you plenty of salsa with your meal and it's delicious, so it's okay. I've had so many of their menu items and everything had been good. Their breakfast burritos are full of bacon and temptingly tasty. The carne asada chips are delightful. The rolled tacos and street tacos are delicious. The fish, shrimp bean and cheese, Titan, and carne asada burritos are all delicious.  The enchiladas, tostadas and shredded beef tacos are all yummy. You can't really go wrong here. There's plenty of parking, but the service is a little slow, so I recommend calling your order in ahead of time. A Santee staple for me. Come here.< /Text>

I've had better customer service at taco bell. Watch out for these guys, make sure to check your food before you leave. They'll give you something completely different from your order them blame you for their mistake. I'm not one to use the term 'the customer's always right', but I'm sure the customer knows what they ordered. Not to mention after reviewing them on Yelp they decided to respond with racist suggestions such as "Maybe you should stick to KFC & Popyes".  I suggest starting away from this place, I know I will be from now on.</review>

<Review>The green salsa. That alone gives this place five stars. It's not mild, like a lot of greens, and it's just delicious. I am a veggie, but I also understand from people who know (and are rather critical) that the carne asada here is up there among the best in SD.<//Review>< Pics>

The prices are good and the food is amazing! Not much seating, so it's mostly for taking out, but it's the only place I go to for my all-time favorite breakfast burrito - potato, egg, and cheese!</text>

Recently had a horrible experience there at los amigos Mexican food.  We just asked for a little bit more guacamole on a rolled tacos because last time it was very dry. They accommodated us but the cook was condescending and wasn't very pleasant to deal with.  I think they need to reach a little older when it comes to these cooks.<//text>

Great food!  This is our go to in Santee.  We love their carne asada, both burritos and the plate.  They hands down have the best breakfast burritos.  Their late opening hours sometimes forces me to go to halburtos but I like Los Amigos better.  Lately phone in orders have been a pain since it is hit or miss if you get through but it’s so good I’ll walk in and order!  The red and green sauces are home made and delicious!</text>

<Date>1453108166175</Date><review>This is the best place for Mexican food in all of the east county. You can get an order of carne asada fries for around seven dollars, they do not give you less food for the price being so low. You still receive the same amount of food you get at some other places for 10 dollars. Whenever anyone ever asks for good Mexican food, los amigos Is always my first suggestion.< /review><name>Abraham Garcia< /name>< Pictures>

Our Bailey can't get enough of this place!  We've done the daycare and boarded her for a night here and it has always gone great.  Every time we pull up to the parking lot our Bailey is already getting overly excited to get in (sorry Dioji staff lol).  Staff is friendly, accommodating, and always professional.  I know she's in good hands when I drop her off here and Bailey will be back very soon!</Review>

<text>My dog Duke loves Dioji. I usually drop him off in Agoura on my way to work in Santa Barbara Duke gets so excited as we approach Chesbrough a while back; I took Duke to SB with me because there's a Dioji in Santa Barbara. When we drove by Chesbrough, Duke became sad. Then I dropped him off at Dioji. He was super happy again. Now he is kind of ok with going past Chesbrough. He does give you the evil eye like he is saying, better drop me off at Dioji SB I'm going to trick him again and take him to Dioji in Goleta<//text>< resp>

<review>Sweet Lucy had a great day at Dioji. I was a bit nervous since she's a 2.7 lbs Chihuahua puppy, but the staff had an eye on her the entire time, and Lucy had a great time socializing. Slept the rest of the day 😊🐾🐾<//review></record></dataset><record>

We love this place they are amazing!   The staff is so kind and friendly and not only watch your  Dog but teach them obedience and training at the same time!  If you have a dog and you REALLY love them, let them go try try his place out, I would compare it to a day at Disney for a 6 year old!< /review>

<text>The spa itself was very clean and super pet friendly- the staff, well... they were AMAZING!!! While we were away they emailed us updates about our pets and offered suggestions to make our pets super comfortable for their stay! The best place we've trusted with our pets in this whole area! ...and trust me, there are lots of choices, but Dioji is the ABSOLUTE BEST! Cannot wait until they come to Oxnard!!!<//text>< Pictures>

My dog Sunshine LOVES going here. She gets so excited when she hears someone say "Dioji" and she can't wait to run inside whenever we pull in to their parking lot. Everyone who works there is very nice. They're well organized. And sometimes I get to see pictures of Sunshine on their Instagram! When she stayed over Labor Day weekend, I got photos emailed to me, and a report of what she did afterwards.< /text>

<Review>I had barely sat down and my car was done. The young gentleman that helped me was professional and helpful. They had exactly what my (picky) car needed. The staff was kind and clearly explained what was going on. I’ve been a technician for over 20yrs. and felt comfortable here.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Didn't show me the oil level or air filter. And you still have to get out of your car to pay when you are done. The lack of communication is the main reason for the low rating. I have had much better experiences for a third of the price. Valvoline is a better choice for this price tier.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1600699554233, 'text': "We aim to provide exceptional communication every step of the way, Jon, and it's disappointing to learn that your recent visit didn't align with this.

<Review>The staff in Castro Valley, California were friendly and professional. Upon changing oil, they explained other services provided; however, they weren't trying to pressure me to purchase non- needed services and performed pertinent services in a timely manner. Furthermore, they had thorough records of previous visits and were able to render accurate maintenance recommendations based on model and usage of my vehicle. Lastly, they gave me a good discount.</Review><rating>5<//rating>< gmapID>

I thought part of the service was to put air in my tires and clean the windows.   Guess not any more as they didn't do either.<//Review>

<Review>I have spent a month working myself up for a painful visit to get work done on my car.
The work was done in about 1  hour ...no long sale pitch  and moaning or teeth gashing  because I didn't want to buy something .
Just  calm, friendly ,professional service.
So very nice, so very nicely done .
good job jiffy lube.<//Review>< pics>

Efficient, in and out quickly, we stayed in car- each employee  was masked.
They were patient with questions and very professional.

I consistently appreciate this Castro Valley Jiffy Lube team- thank you stay safe - Lisa< /Text>

After service drove my car 3 days later. My engine and tire traction lights came on. Drove back home and my husband, who is an auto master tech by trade, checked tires. Then ran the diagnostic program on his laptop which came up with code 171 which is a lean issue. He then found that the air intake hose was unplugged. Luckily my husband was able to fix and knew what to do. I, as a female, with no automobile knowledge was very worried driving with these lights on. Someone else may have had to incur mechanic expenses. Anyway, this was my 2nd time at Castro Valley JL. I don't trust them now. So won't be back.< /review>

<Text>I don't know, lots of things happened one of the guys in the shop requested to verify the oil in the truck and it was low in oil, so as I am filling the truck with diesel he went to the gas station with me to double check the oil in the truck so after he checked it requested to go back and filled it up correctly.
This guy is a good man for sure.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x808f917400000001:0x138c41d7258e0ce4< /GmapID></record>

Spilled oil all over my lower cross member which created a small pool of oil. I had to go car wash to spray all the oil off it. Even after the wash, it still dripped a few drops on my driveway which created a stain</Text>

Not very thorough and you have to get out of the car to pay. That means walking around the car while it's being serviced. Customers shouldn't be walking around the garage and payment should be touchless. I guess they changed the oil but they didn't do anything else. For $100 I expect a bit more.</Text>

Nice people, I'll be back. However, they left my air box open when they checked my Engine air filter; my windshield wiper fluid was NOT topped off(stated in final report); and they did not add air to tires(stated in final report). I'll be back because for $33 they will vacuum my floors and change my oil and filter. You just have to look under the hood before you leave.< /Review>

<text>I love the customer service. It starts before you have a chance to get out of your car.  The service on my car was prompt and efficient. They are a thoughtful group of people. I would encourage people to use this Jiffy lube on Castro Valley Blvd.

This posting is over a year old. It no longer applies. My next visit 11 months later, was the total opposite of previous visit. I was so shocked.

This place is a rip off and you will not get what you paid for. Normally I do my own oil changes but on this particular date (12-3-16) I was feeling a little lazy and decided to take it in and just have it done. From the moment my vehicle was brought in for the oil change I watched them service my vehicle step by step from the waiting room. They drove my vehicle into the garage opened up the hood-pulled out the dipstick and removed the oil fill cap. From there they proceeded to the side door which leads downstairs so they can have access to drain plug underneath the vehicle. After about 10 minutes the guy comes back up from downstairs and and starts putting new motor oil into my vehicle and didn't even change my oil filter. The oil filter in my Chevy Equinox is located right by the oil fill cap and can only be removed from the top of the vehicle, Not underneath!  The technician finished doing what he was doing then came inside and told the cashier that my vehicle was ready. (I don't think so)
After talking with the cashier and letting him know what I just witnessed he must've apologized a hundred times out of embarrassment. He then went and had a talk with his technician and from there my vehicle was back in the garage getting a new oil filter.                I don't recommend coming here......< /text>

The service is terrible. They usually do the minimum required to change your oil, then check off a bunch of services they didn't perform.

The management and staff has changed several times in the past few years, but the service still stinks.

I called asking about wait times, and the person answering the phone said, "Saturday is our busiest day, we probably can't fit you in." As I drive by five minutes later, the parking lot was empty, along with all the bays. I needed my oil changed, and Midas was too busy, so I went in. They did an OK job, but charged my extra for "extra oil" (charged me for 4.5 gallons at the 5 gallon and under price, then .5 gallons at the over 5 price).

There are plenty of better options out there.< /review>

Went for an oil change on Presidents Day 2017.  The two gentlemen there explained that their computer system was down, and that they couldn't take credit cards or print receipts.  Paid cash, accepting their promise that I could come back the next day for a receipt.

The next day, there was no record of my oil having good been changed in their computer,

Evidently, this kind of behavior is of no concern to management, because my complaint through their website was not addressed at all.< /text>

<text>I never write reviews because Everyone has their own subjective experience. On the other hand I get my car serviced at the Castro Valley Jiffy Lube semi-frequently and the service is consistently exceptional. The facility is clean and organized and they go far beyond their duties. I went for a casual oil change when I was informed they did not have my filter. Instead of not replacing my filter or making me come back David, the associate manager paid for a filter out of pocket from a nearby store.<//text>< pictures>

I have been coming here for about a year, and have been generally happy with the service.  That all ended today.  When I arrived today, I was told the lower pit staff had just taken lunch, and if i came back in 20 minutes, I could be helped then.

When I returned 23 minutes later, I was told the pit staff still had 15 minutes on their lunch, and I that I had  been given incorrect information about when people started and stopped their break.

Somehow, JiffyLubes inability to staff and communicate properly was my fault,  and Anthony's attitude was "fine leave, I still have 15 minutes on lunch"

In the past I have had to point out little things, like you forgot this, or you left this in the car; but this just goes to show how little they care for their customers, their customers time, and the business as a whole.

Service work is always based on trust.  A good trust measurement for me  has been customer service.  If you do not care how you present to the customer, you don't care about your job. if you do not care about what you do,  I cannot trust you, and I won't do business with you.

I will never be back< /Text>

They were done with my full size truck in less than 5 minutes and boasted that they "waste no time" and then collected my 75 dollars. I don't think they did anything to my truck except check tire pressure to be honest, as they were laughing the whole 5 minutes. I will never come back again.<//review></record></dataset><record>

On my wife’s car instead of removing the cover to access the filter and drain plug they cut holes in the cover with  saw without permission.  I didn't notice until next oil change.

This is why they wont let you sit in car while they service it.  If I would have heard them using a saw while changing the oil I would have stopped them!< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>This facility forgot or neglected to replace an air filter, which I was charged for anyways. I didn't know until I got the vehicle smoged and the mechanics at the smog place caught it missing. Was driving around for quite a while without a filter.. maybe took a few years off the engine as a result.

I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone! I came for an oil change in April 2016. To find out a week after driving my car the technician left my oil cap opened causing oil to burst out every where my check engine came on. I came back to speak to the manager which he didn't seem to give a crap.  He wasn't apologetic at all for his employee's error, all he said was "your next oil change is free". So I'm here today to redeem this oil change. I asked the manager if he could throw in a tire rotation which doesn't cause the company to lose anything he said "No we only agreed to the oil change that's it!" Im just shocked at how crappy this company is and I work in customer service. I would not recommend this place to anyone, and PLEASE CHECK YOUR OIL CAP BEFORE LEAVING! !!</Text>

Their customer service is ridiculous. You're cut off and your questions aren't answered. Your extra services offered aren't actually done. (My coolant was low, she said it was full, though it was extremely hard to hear her because of how much she was mumbling.)

After this last oil change, they lose my business. Doesn't matter the location I go to, customer service is poor, services aren't done, and the price for it all is not worth it. Just go somewhere else...< /text>

<rating>5</rating><Review>This is one of my favorite stores. It is an arcata treasure. If you want clean delicious drinking water this is the place to get it. The owner is always very helpful and the prices are quite reasonable. We have bought several five gallon jugs and a chlorine filter for our garden here, so our vegetables and our bodies are much healthier thanks to New World Water.< /Review>< Pics>

Best, best place to get water! I love the O2 station to disinfect bottles. Double osmosis and other techniques are used to get the best tasting water. The owner is a gem. Don't know what I would do without this place!< /review>

A friend told me to go here for water and I am so glad they did!

The staff was really friendly and helpful and owner took the time to show me around and answer all my questions.

The environment was so chill and comfortable, you just know that the water is being charged right.

And yes, the water tastes amazing!

Definitely a blessing to the community.< /Review>

We are so grateful to have access to such amazing water. Our tap at home is a very nice well that is Mike's better than municipal water.. but we crave this water when we run out. It's glorious! Dare I say life changing? 😁👍</Review>

Best restroom in the whole big wide world. Seriously good vibes, and that's a big deal when your buying your hydration there. Cannot recommend this place enough. Any questions about H2o , or just about what's going on locally . I actually feel like a better person just for buying my water here. Yay New World Water Lady. Great job<//Text>

New World Water is probably the best water store anywhere! Not only is the water divine, but the artwork is also very cool! They even have a sweet little kids corner with toys and books and a fish tank to entertain little ones.</text>

<Text>This is my favorite place in Arcata hands down, the energy inside is so soothing, calming, refreshing..i sometimes just walk in to grab cbd water and just within the five minutes of being in the room I feel cleansed. The owner is also so sweet it helps you understand how the place got such great energy! Love this place< /Text></record>

I absolutely LOVE this place; it makes drinking water hip, cool and social! There are several options here for water refills, including some mineral and PH options from the different taps. They sell large 5 gallon tanks, different bottles and many accessories. Make sure to get a frequent water buyer card, every 13th, 5-Gallon refills, you get one free. They also carry a CBD water with increased bio availability.< /Review>

Has a playground for kids and two fields. One for baseball and the other one is just an open field with soccer goals on each end. There are bleachers for both fields too. Has a water fountain and there is relatively little shade.<//Review>

My family and I went to pick out pumpkins here. The prices are fair and they make it very easy to browse or you can look through the patch for some as well. The workers were nice and helpful. We only planned on getting one pumpkin, but since it was so easy to put pumpkins in the provided wagons we got many more. Face masks are required, and they have disinfectant wipes to clean your wagon.</review>

Not too crowded, prices for pumpkins were reasonable. Free maze for the kids (which my kids did for twenty minutes, over and over and over again)<//text>

I prefer this pumpkin patch over all the others. They have a corn maze, tractor ride, produce for sale and a great selection of pumpkins. Great place!!!</review>

<text>A very muddy experience.  The parking is free but very small.  Maybe 10-12 cars can fit.  The corn maze looks promising but it was so muddy that day, it wasn't worth the effort.  The pumpkin patch is small but the pumpkins looked good.  The kids maze was flooded so we couldn't go in there either.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

I paid for my 12 month subscription and for some odd reason it’s saying I did not pay for it. I don’t understand how I can’t play non of my online games because PlayStation is saying I didn’t pay. Like PlayStation is the worst gaming company. Really PlayStation should shut down there company for good<//review>

Was on hold for 15mn or so, was reading the terrible reviews and was pretty nervous to be honest. I had a card issue on my account that I wasn’t able to remove or update, was helped immediately on their end and fixed. Super happy with the outcome, thank you again!<//review>

Thought my issues were resolved and they aren't. I just want my card to be taken off my account that I'm not even able to access and to cancel the whole account. Chat support sucks. First person had me fooled. Probably won't even get a refund. Second person never replied back after about 5 minutes. Good job guys 👏< /review>

I was hacked back in March 2020. I called daily for 2 weeks with no one working due to the pandemic and have continued calling once a week. It’s been OVER A YEAR!!!! I have still yet to speak to anyone. And I cannot cancel the hacked account because they changed the emails and passwords. Still paying for two accounts now because I had to add another so my kids could continue playing. Still waiting to get my stolen information resolved.<//Review>

Refuse to work with me to resolve an issue from hacking after being a loyal customer for 12+ years with zero issues of safety or privacy. Lost everything with my account including saved data, games purchased online, and my Psn account. Never had a more heartbreaking time with customer service. Extremely disappointed.
Moral of the story I’m now a newly founded Xbox series x owner and game pass rules.</review>

Was sent an email that someone had switched my email. Immediately called PlayStation and emailed them back. No answer to either. In the meantime my back account was fraudulently charged $150 dollars before I could shut my card off. Tried to call again sent another email no response from PlayStation. Seems like this is a common problem with PlayStation. Maybe it’s time for a class action lawsuit. At a minimum the next console I buy will not be a PlayStation. Since they clearly don’t give a s**t about their customers.

Update. Got a hold of PlayStation. They basically told me if I report fraud which is what this is they will ban my account. I will be throwing away all 3 of my PlayStations and switching to a console that has better service. PlayStation is trash. I’m very disappointed cause I’ve spent thousands on PlayStation equipment and content. I’ve played it since the original PS as a kid. Whoever is running the show over there needs to be fired.<//text>

<Text>Worst customer service I have ever experienced. Bought a dlc pack that was improperly labeled then refused a refund (description for dlc I bought was actually describing a different dlc) even with a willingness to buy the actual content I wanted.

I would give them a zero if I  could. I tried the chat they want you to pay to get help. They are already stealing money from my account and then they ask me to give them my card #. So I call the # just to be told to do it online and be hung up on. Biggest fraud ever.<//Review>

My grandson just got off is ps4 an hour ago and now he is trying to get back on and this is what it says. ( Access to Playstation Network by this account has been permanently suspended due to violations of Playstation Network terms of service and user agreement (ws-37368-7). What up with that he was playing fortnite with his friends.  He did nothing wrong or said nothing wrong!!!!!!!!!! We all should get together and sue them. I've spent a lot on money on Playstations and their stuff.. I bought 3 ps4 for my grandkids. I've bought games online and accessories for the games.  Thanks a lot for NOTHING!!!!!!< /Text>

<Review>First of all, my account was locked for almost a  day and I tried to reset my password but they wouldn’t send me an email verification, so due to this I tried to call psn support and guess what, NO ONE ANSWERED, and so the next day I tried calling them again, they answered but I was put on hold, then I got a call from a random number and so I answered, the lady on call described herself as a CSR but she sounded sketchy. She asked for my credentials in order to verify my account and from there I knew it was a scam. Tried calling them again but they didn’t answer. Now my account is currently out of my hands and I can’t do nothing about it. Spent money on you guys to be treated like this? Hell nah I’m switching to Xbox, matter of fact, PC.<//Review><name>WØØ BÃBŸ< /name>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Account banned for a chargeback because NO ONE answers the phone and chat is “too busy” due to Covid.  How can you get your money back if they don’t answer the phone or answer chat?  Call your bank and request a chargeback. Wait a minute...as soon as you do that, your account gets banned!   So someone is actually working after all??  Just not in the custoemrs interests.  This makes the nex-gen console decision very easy for me.

This kind of business model went out with the dinosaurs.  So did outsourcing your support to India..one of the rudest cultures around.  Sure, Sony saves a buck using $1 support people, but wow, no support for a multi-billion dollar company? Bad choice.  I’m out..moving on.</Review>

I spent $50 on a game that requires PlayStation plus so I try to buy PlayStation plus but a error keeps popping up. I google a way to fix it but nobody knows how so now I have to get in touch with PlayStation in order to pay more for a game I already bought. And the worse part is PlayStation won’t even answer their phone and they see the issue with PlayStation plus but they still request money and still won’t fix it. Do better if u want somebody to buy a $500 console from u.< /review>

<Review>THEY DESERVE 0 my son's account was hacked and they told him he had to wait 6 months nothing happened. It's been almost a year. Now they shut down the account for miss use. Thousands of dollars in games lost. No one will do nothing about it. Now when he try to text them they just they ask his account number and they do not respond after that this is bull.
SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE.
IF YOU SELL DOWNLOADABLE STUFF YOU NEED PPL TO ANSWER CALLS AND HELP THEM GET THE ACCOUNT BACK HE SHOULD NEVER OF LOST HIS PRIME ACCOUNT.< /Review>< gmapID>

So I was banned for 7 days and I called to appeal it and I called and called and they never answered. So I just waited until my ban was done. I did and I played for about 15 minutes and boom, banned again for no reason and this time it’s for 30 days. I called and emailed PlayStation sooo many times and they yet to respond back to me. PlayStation to be honest if your going to have a company, be good at customer service. This makes me want to switch back to Xbox if this keeps happening.< /text>

My account was hacked and unauthorized purchases were made. I disputed them with my bank and the bank conformed it was fraud. PlayStation then suspends my account because they want my money. I am unable to restart any app and can't even get a hold of someone. Perfect timing to renew my PS plus and I cant even use it now. PS sucks. Im switching to Nintendo</text>

If something goes wrong you’re out of luck because you can’t call customer supports (“we can’t take your call at this time”) and their online chat bot can’t actually do anything helpful. Just an animated QA bot. If I could rate it lower then one star I would. I asked for a call back then an hour later they call back, automated message tells me “we are connecting you with a person” then the call ends.... DONT BUY PLAYSTATION PRODUCTS.< /Review>< Pictures>

I am in complete shock!!! I have called this number 50 times and every time the automated system says "due to extremely high call volumes we are unable to take your call at this time, goodbye"  I have spent $1000's of dollars on Sony products over many years!!! I will NEVER EVER give this company another penny! There customer service doesn't exist !! Don't waste your money or time! Sony is a JOKE!<//Review>

Called customer support today, very helpful and attentive. She checks back every 2 minutes while I’m on hold. Had my PSVR padding replacement shipped to Hawaii for free, both material and shipping for free.
However took over a month for delivery. And several confusing messages from them during the delivery.<//Review>

I finally did and they eventually reimbursed me the money but my account is still locked. Was told I’d receive an email within 7 business days on how to access my account and reset password after their investigation. It’s been over a month now.

Playstation customer support offers the worse customer service ever, they make all this money, yet provide the worse service.  It's a scam. There always extremely busy, no options for a call back number. Call waiting is extensive and they just tell you to go online to resolve your issues and hang up on you. Even the online services through the chat bot are ridiculous and inconvenient.  What a shame.</Text>

<Date>1609895874536< /Date><Review>This company deserves a -0 or below they banned my son account saying he violated company policy. Someone hacked his account, plus I have pictures showing proof. It saddens me to know they do not care about their customers. I spent a lot of money on this system for them to pocket it only for them to ban my son for some mess he didn't do. This company is a disgrace I will definitely go back to Xbox this is not right at all to take our money. Then they want you to chat instead of talking on the phone this is so unprofessional. I didn't want to give this a star at all because it deserves to poop emoji instead of a star.< /Review><UserId.>110787261761496006720< /UserId.>< GmapID>

Don’t call them. PS is the worst customer service ever. Apparently there is no number for actual help. Waited on hold for 1 hour 27 minutes for the guy to tell me he couldn’t help me, he wouldn’t find anyone to help me and there was nothing he could do. If I couple give them a negative score I’d give it to them.< /text>

<Review>Called many times and all I get is "call volume is to high good bye". Is this how playstation treats people now? I remember they use to care and answer peoples calls. They need to get there stuff together and hire people to answer there phones. Online support sucks worse then the calls itself.

I feel everyone else's frustration with Playstation, and how they don't really care about their consumer's. They permanently suspended my account because I fought what I thought was a fraudulent charge because it said other things besides Playstation network, so I disputed it. To which instead of doing the reasonable thing and contact me to see what happened to their payment they acted like little children and suspended my account. I've contacted them for 4 days either by email or by trying to get a live person on the phone to no avail. What I did do was file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and let them run with it. Supposedly now that I paid them they'd better reactivate my account.</Review>

<review>Id give zero stars if I could. No live phone customer service and they disconnect from chat service if you can figure out how to actually contact someone. When they disconnect they then block you becuase "they've already helped you"  well ps4 customer service. You didnt help me. Someone hacked my account. They stole from my real bank account and change the phone number on my account so I can't get my account back. I've loved PlayStation products since ps1 and after this ill never buy another one. This is ridiculous.</review>< gmapID>

They permanently suspended my account because I fought what I thought was a fraudulent charge because it said other things besides Playstation network, so I disputed it. To which instead of doing the reasonable thing and contact me to see what happened to their payment they acted like little children and suspended my account. I've contacted them for 4 days either by email or by trying to get a live person on the phone to no avail. What I did do was file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and let them run with it. Supposedly now that I paid them they'd better reactivate my account.</Review>

<review>If I could give it a -5 stars I would. We were banned bc I disputed charges on PSN thru my card company in MARCH when covid hit. We had just purchased a playstation so we would have something to do during quarantine. We haven't been able to play it since the ban and cannot get a hold of customer service or use the chat bot. Completely ridiculous. I have come to loathe this company. It is the WORST customer service!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x808f9ec3d79b09fb:0x42f17b2ead6b29b9<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Just the same as other people my account was hacked and someone bought two games that I would never play. They refused to refund the money for those games, even though i didn’t even purchase those games. There was no phone operators and I got disconnected from the chat I was in because it took to long to type. I feel for all the other people who have experienced this problem, as my account got banned, but they lifted it, then it got banned again for the same reason at the beginning of this virus.< /text>

Trying to get in contact this seems like a last resort. I've tried calling, I've tried the chat but it just ends up telling me to call. My account was hacked with three consecutive payments of around $50. That's not my fault it was hacked, and now im banned ?! I understand the pandemic, but there should be a way to get a hold of someone, I thought people from this company would be able to work from home but it seems not.</text>

<rating>1</rating><review>My account has been hacked and this company does not care about me as a customer what so ever. All the money and time I've spent on my account means nothing to this corporate monster. I've been trying for a while now to recover my account while someone else has been on it playing my games. It seems this company has nothing set in place to help protect customer accounts during this pandemic. There is not a single real person i can get in contact with. I go onto their website only to be met with a wall of bots and scripts designed for specific operations that have nothing to do with the issue i have. It says on their support website that they will not have phone operators for another 2-3 weeks. This means the hacker will have my account and bank information for that long as well. I wonder how much damage he will do in that time.</review>< pics>

<Text>I'm just wanting to track an order.  Has been over a month.  Unable to connect via phone or online to customer support.   Mind boggling?  Definitely going Microsoft from here on out.  I get it that's a global pandemic.  You would think most reps could work from home.  Embarrassed for Sony.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Honestly not sure why I keep calling for the automated system to keep telling me to call back at 9 when they’re open and it’s 9:10 and I’ve called like 15 times, pretty sure I’m wasting my time....<//text>

Worst support I have ever seen on any website. The limited ways to contact them don’t even work. The phone number you call will tell you it’s currently unavailable and to use the live chat on PlayStation support. You will lose connection to the live chat before it ever connects with someone if you even try. The website is terribly put together and makes it impossible to actually fix your problem.</Review>

I bought a ps4 for my sons 7th birthday, then i got him a ps plus for 3 months with my debit card, then i downloaded a game called apex because it said it was (key word) "FREE". Now somehow he charged over 300 dollars on my debit card playing this so called Free game. I caught this on my bank account within 2 weeks, i made a complaint to psn and they won't help me or give me any kind of refund at all. I didn't really want to say this either but my son has a learning disability, and he can't read yet, but yet he somehow was able to make these transactions, and now that it's done they won't help me at all, 300 dollars is alot, its not a small amount, now they just keep kicking me out of their chat when I ask for help, and I can't reach anyone by phone either, I wish they would help me it was a an honest mistake, they shouldn't make it so easy to do this even for an adult, not everyone knows every detail about this technology, but we still buy it and pay monthly for this service for what? To be turned away like you're nothing.<//text>

I spent a lot of money on my games and even got a game drive so the games would run off the game drive instead of the system and it helped but playstation will clearly never resolve theirs fu***** problems.

<Review>Online support is a joke. I'm trying to change my email and they won't update because I need to remember the serial number to the first console I owned that I set my account on, a ps3 14 years ago.... And the last 4 of a Cc I no longer own. And to top it off their phone service is closed.

Good job Sony.....< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I went homeless as a veteran for a while. Couldn’t log into old email account because yahoo doesn’t have customer service. Had to set up new account, but when I tried to talk to chat to see if I had to repurchase FFXIV even though it was on my Square Enix account, I was rudely disconnected promptly. Did not hit refresh or anything on my side so it was them. Why have a customer service that has individuals getting paid, which our PlayStation Plus membership is more than likely funding if this is what happens? Maybe they should lower the psn monthly cost if we don’t get the proper service we deserve. Very disappointed in them. I know we are just a number, but to me, this is an escape to help my ptsd after 47 months in Iraq and Afghanistan. Shame on you Sony< /Review>< pictures>

I have looked through their entire website and every number I call either does not work or is answered by a robot telling me that there is nobody available to help me. I go to the website again and the robot tells me I need to actually call someone to help me. Godamnit I love my PlayStation and you wont even help me so that I can play it!< /text>< pics>

You guys are horrible. You’ve been taking money out of my account for MONTHS!  But I can’t get ahold of anyone on the phone.  You want us to request a refund via the Support Bot but that entire process is dumb.  I answered a series of seven (7) questions just to get redirected to a number that IS NOT IN USE!

I would like my money back.</text>

This company gets a zero from me when it comes to customer service. My account has been banned and I have no idea why? I have been trying to get in contact with someone and I keep reaching a recording that directs me to a online chat that is a joke! I did not want to select the star. I had to to post.<//Text>

My husband's account was hacked so he disputed the charges and was given back the money through his bank! Months later playstation decides to suspend his account because there is an overcharge on fortnite. My husband live chats with them and their only response is that to unsuspend his account he has to pay the $64 that HE DIDNT CHARGE! That's extremely piss poor customer service ESPECIALLY when he can prove he didn't do it! Will NEVER buy another playstation product again!</Text>

The absolute worst customer service I’ve ever encountered in my life. We are being billed on a duplicate account that we cannot cancel.
Is there a consumer protection hot line that can possibly help all of us out that can get after Sony?< /review>

PS4 bricked after the last system update. And they conveniently shut down their telephone support so that you cannot talk with anyone about it. Seems like they did it on purpose to try and sell more units right be the PS5 launch.< /Text>

Worst experience I ever had. There is literally no way to contact them. Sony no longer offers phone support and the request a chat won't get past the pre chat verification, which I've tried 8 times.  Since I have wasted hours of time reading and watching tutorials that don't answer my question and they prevent me from contacting them I give them Negative 5 Stars, that's (-5). NOTE: you can't post your comment without giving them at least 1 star, but don't let that prerequsite fool you. I also filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.</Review>

I was banned about a week or two ago of playstation and I’ve already made a new account I understand it’s a world pandemic but you can’t have a decent conversation with the PlayStation bot and they never even help with the problems and I’ve called 20 times in the past week and there staff availability is low so I can’t get anyone on the phone y’all don’t have people working from home!?!?!?<//Review>

<text>Absolutely a joke with them lately, I use to share the same account with my brother however it’s mine now so I decided to change the email however the verification code was sent to his number and he doesn’t have a line anymore and there is no way of getting the verification code to sign back into psn I’m about to switch to Xbox I understand this whole corona thing but they need to be working at home because clearly they are not and all these reviews show. Just sad how much money spent and they have to take forever. Is it really playstation support? Because it doesn’t seem like it.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

Absolutely terrible and frustrating that I can’t get a hold of them! My account was hacked somehow and they ended up suspending my account! Which is absolutely not fair because I didn’t do this. I’ve been trying to get a hold of them for a month and no response yet. If social media reps are still working I wouldn’t see why Sony still isn’t. And to know that I’m not the only one who is experiencing a suspended account speaks volume!!!< /review>

With all stores closed I bought my son his birthday present through PlayStation. I removed my card from the game system. And still over 700 dollars was stolen off my card. My whole stimulus check was stolen from PlayStation and they r refusing to stop charging my child for games he doesn't own.</review>

I've been trying to contact Playstation regarding my account. My account has been deactivated because I stop payment on an unauthorized charge. So now I can log into y account. I've went on the website it says that I have to chat with some or call but the chat is down when you call the phone number the messages says to talk with someone via chat. This has been going on for 3 weeks now. This is worst ever. All I want to do is play my play station.< /Text>

Terrible customer support!! Call services are down. Unable to connect to support via live chat. Their twitter account doesnt resolve anything. I used to be such a PlayStation fan now I would never support them again. DO NOT BUY PS5 WHEN IS COMES OUT! I switched to PC gaming and its sooo much better. No more over paying for PS Plus services!</Text>

It deserves 0 stars this company is trash when it comes to customer service. There is no way I get suspended for nothing. I don't even know why I was suspended. I just wake up one day to see that my account has been suspended. Trash. Horrible services. Even after I try to contact them they have bots responding to me.<//review>

<review>Ive been trying to reach these people for months and they are always “close”. There’s no phone services for customer at all! They referred you to go PlayStation support but  there’s no even an online rep that can answer your questions or concerns. I don’t understand!!!<//review>< pictures>

<Text>How can you say your company has customer support when you don’t employ live agents to assist with customer issues. When someone’s network is hacked your company provides no support whatsoever. You only respond to the bank when the charges are disputed. If anyone is reading this please don’t make purchases on the PSN they have very poor cyber security and don’t provide help at all.<//Text><resp>None</resp>< user_id>

My PSN account was hacked on Sunday 4/19. My Email and password were changed and fraudulent charges were made on my account. Now I am unable to sign back in to the PSN. I have contacted the PlayStation support live chat at least 40 times now. I have all the information they need. But they tell me they “don’t have access to the account because of security reasons” then who does have access!?!? No one seems to have any answers over there. Someone STOLE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION AND MY MONEY. THAT IS A CRIME! Who is going to reimburse me for the hundreds of dollars I’ve lost in games. And have no common decency to respond. I know others have had this same problem and no one is helping them either.<//text>

<Review>If I could give negative stars I would. My husband’s account got hacked and charged my credit card $100+. After several days of trying to use the Bot, I created a Twitter account to get ahold of them. The twitter account told me to talk to the live chat, which I couldn’t get through. Then Twitter account ignored MANY messages and tweets. I had to contact my bank and then PlayStation banned my husbands account. Extremely disappointed that they have the worst customer service I have every dealt with. Hopefully their company will make things right when COVID is over, as I have seen many situations where this is happening and PlayStation is just stealing money from people. During a time where people do not have jobs, PlayStation is just money hungry.< /Review><Resp>None<//Resp><user>115312864155857984397< /user><Name>Jenna Mallard< /Name>< pics>

I’ve been a PlayStation freak ever since I was in high school(I’m in my mid 30s). I bought a PS4 Pro a year ago. I’ve been trying to contact PlayStation for almost 2 weeks. As of 2-3 days ago it went past the 1year marker. So now it’s out of warranty. The PlayStation Pro was a total failure! How does the hard drive die within a year?! PlayStation you are failing us miserably!< /text>

<Text>I was double charged for PlayStation plus, and cant get ahold of anyone to get one of the charges reversed!!! My monthly subscription wasnt extended by two months but I was charged for two months!   Also, I NEVER put my credit card out there online, I use a pre-paid card, and I NEVER turn on auto pay. It is always turned off after every renewal. Yet Sony automatically debited my card!!  Whatever kind of business they are running here, we want no part of it!!!   This is why we are considering going to Xbox.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I got banned for a “inappropriate user Id” when my name is “Wndow_lickr”. And all my games are locked except for the ones I have on disk and the games I pre ordered come out tomorrow and I doubt I’ll be able to play them upon launch now. The phone services are down. I can’t get through live chat because they changed my online Id and won’t let me view my new one because you have to log in to view it. But I can’t log in because my account is banned... worst costumer service ever. I love PlayStation when it works, but it messes up it shouldn’t take weeks to fix.<//review>

<rate>1<//rate><review>I have tried to call for 3 weeks and was constantly sent to the answering service that told me to call back. Then I tried to reach out to the chat and they told me that for my issues I needed to talk to a live agent. They never gave me a time for an appointment. Today I finally get  to talk to a live person and it was completely pointless. The conclusion of the call was that I have to pay PlayStation money for the money they stole out my account. This is not the first occurrence. They told me it is my fault for having a card on file even though I turned off auto payments multiple times and canceled it from my PlayStation and was still charged again. Also the supervisor was very dismissive and told me to just make a new account even though it is my business account. I have had every PlayStation device and I will never buy from this again. Horrible customer service and no regard for their customers.<//review>< Pics>

I absolutely love playstation. I had one problem with a game not showing up and I got ahold of someone within minutes and it was fixed in about 15 minutes. The only reason it took more than 45 seconds is because the rep had to collect some of my information. I appreciate every member of the playstation team< /Review>

My account got banned, and I am not able to access literally a single setting to manage my account, or any other account on my PlayStation. I can’t redownload games I’ve already purchased, and I can’t add psn to my other accounts. This is the worst customer service I’ve ever had to deal with. It’s been 2 months of nothing but an automated call basically telling me to F off. Sony is completely losing their fan base quicker than I’ve ever seen any other company do so. SMD< /review>

It appears that there are not any remote policies, systems, nor procedures in place to assist, guide and support customers during this current pandemic. Since last week I have been trying to reach someone besides the inefficient refund bot to discuss two charges to my accoung that I did not make. No one is available and I am still awaiting a refund.</Text>

Their service is honestly terrible because I keep calling and when I call they just hang up saying their is al lot of people calling instead of just putting me on hold also I get on in the morning and get off and come back about an hour later and my account was permanently suspended for what I did nothing to the game honestly a PS4 is a waste of time and money.</text>

I contacted them by their chat with a problem. They blamed everything but their equipment or their network and rushed off the line. I’ve scrubbed and deactivated every device until the only thing left was the PlayStation. I contacted my isp and had my router given a new I’d. My up is dynamic and they still blamed everyone else. Then when I tried to get help during when most people are available they are closed on every single way of communication. No twitter response, phone center is closed, and the chat was down. I work for a major corporation that puts our customers first. That is not what PlayStation is doing<//Text>

PlayStation costumer service is lousy .I have been trying to comunicate whit them for almost 2 months since they cut my service,
because of my mistake one day that I could not enter play online I tried all the ways to enter but I could not .. By mistake 2 more payments were added ..knowing that I had already paid my annual fee. I tried to talk to The playstation costumer service to explain what had happened but until the date I could not Conctact anyone, the problem is that I call my bank And they fought the charge that was Charged. Now They came to the conclusion that I actually did the purchase , I accept it well any ways 2 more years play online is ok. But now I. Have neither the service. Nor even 180$$ they took. From my account😡</Text>

they really don't care at all that my account was stolen from me. I have been trying to recover my account for a week now and they refuse to help me. I have spent years on this account and have thousands of dollars and time put into that account and they're just gonna let someone else steal it. I am close to calling my lawyer and putting a lawsuit because of this.<//text>

Play station consul was “not bad” after I bought their year plus membership, a week later I see an unauthorized charge for another membership from Sony, so I ended up calling my banks fraud department, couple Days later Sony send an email my account has been suspended for chargebacks. no customer service whatsoever just bots smh, I’d give them 0 stars if that would be possible. Time to flip the switch to Xbox!< /review>

They’ve been lying for weeks saying their support line is just limited. It’s just a voicemail that has a bot be more honest than the company and admit the line is closed. I’ve been trying to get in touch with support because I’ve tried to sign up with PS Now but it says there’s a ghost PayPal signed in on pc, then on the PS4 it says there’s no payment information but refuses to allow my dad to sign in his PayPal. Not changing my review until this is resolved.< /review>

PSN refuses to answer the phone I’ve called multiple times everyday at different times each day for the past week yet no answer it’s honestly amazing how terrible the customer service is

Update: I called at the exact time the call center opened and finally they answered but apparently they have a call center just so they can tell you they don’t have the ability to help and you have to do everything online which I had already done and it didn’t work so I’m yet to have my problem solved</text>

My son was logged out of his account when we tried to log back in  “incorrect password”. After changing the password now they want 2 part factor code which we are not logged in on any other device so not possible to receive one. I tried to call customer service not available at the moment. online support not available at the moment. So imagine a nine-year-old boy dealing with the covid-19 lockdown and not having access to his account. THANK YOU SONY!!! I was going to buy him the PS5 for Christmas. Now he doesn’t want it anymore.  Xbox here we come!!!!</text>

It wouldn’t let me refund a game that I had just purchased last night just because I downloaded it. I wanted to refund the game because I was to young to play it with my friends but I can play it by myself though and I can’t even change my age so I have to wait til I’m 18 in order to play the game so this was a waste of time DONT BUY A PS4 UNLESS YOUR ACCOUNT IS OVER 18 and if it isn’t then your screwed on most things might as well just BUY AN XBOX<//Review>

I was charge 24.99 for 3 months worth of internet that was not authorized by me. Couldn't get a whole of them. So i call my bank to dispute the charge. Next thing i know psn sent me a email saying my account is suspended. Never did i had any problems with playstation until this matter. I rather go back to the ps3. At least i wasn't disappointed. But will say this who ever is willing to put a lawsuit on playstation. Im game cause i put to much money in this system.<//Review>

The worse customer service on the planet.  I still don’t understand how they are still operating. Spent hundreds of dollars trying to buy games that later cannot be redeemed.  Cannot connect to anybody online or via phone. The support team is fake. This is a scam!</Review>

PlayStation is a joke. Their customer service is a joke. They literally take your money without authorization, and refuse to give it back. second time PlayStation has done this. I would not recommend.<//Text>

They allow people to make racist slurs and get away with it it is unforgivable and customer service is horrible it is not worth the initial 350 dollars for the system plus the 60 dollars a year to actually play games. If you say anything to anyone they will suspend your account if if you are not in the wrong they are very unprofessional and a waste of time.< /review>

<review>My account has been hacked. The hacker spent over $500 on PSN. I have been trying to contact customer support for days now. To explain the occurring. I notified my bank and card of the issue. And they were able to reemberse me for the hacker money spent. But now I am banned and can't log into the PSN account and customer support is not open or taking calls. I am very displeased with the service and will be contacting customer support again until answered. Then i will file a civil complaint and take them to court if need be.</review>< pictures>

i’ve tried numerous of times to contact Playstation and Sony and there is no phone support and nobody is returning emails. They automatically charged my account, even though it’s incorrect billing information and the charged was more than what it’s advertised for! Hope your merchant doesn’t mind dealing with chargebacks<//Text>

Terrible gamer support. I changed my email and got disconnected from the network. As I no longer have access to my old email I couldn’t get a reset on my password online. When I tried the support phone number it kept saying it was closed even though I was calling during normal business hours. PlayStation doesn’t care about supporting their gamers obviously. Looks like I’ll switch to Xbox< /text>

You have live chat support agents that put the customers info in a system to help the customers but the customers already typing there info in the chat. Why don't you make that system available to the customers to use instead? The customers already typing those info them selves.

Support chat is unable to do anything, and the phone lines are shut down due to Covid. An unknown party has full control over my account, including all of its information and permissions. Sony has left me with no other choice but to cancel my debit card and open another PSN account. I've lost hundreds of dollars' worth of digital downloads purchased over the years, and many hundreds of hours of gameplay, the save data to which I no longer have access to. This company has completely failed to help me after many years of patronage.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Billion dollar company. Wont answer any calls, Finally I was able to reach someone from support on chat. Agent ends chat on the final step towards recovering my account, thus leaving me without access to the account I am currently paying for. Additionally, not a single email has gotten through to me, not once in five+ years across multiple account with different email addresses. I have been a playstation fan for most of my life, but the way youve been handling your customers lately is just shameful.</Review>< Pics>

They get 0 stars but that wasn’t an option. They changed my online id for no reason at all, then made ME PAY TO CHANGE IT. That should be illegal to change my name then make me pay to change it to something else. Cause they not making money so they gotta go and make money another way by Messing with peoples accounts. I should sue y’all.<//Text>

I’m unable to play online mode because there is unknown email appearing when requested to login. Since I don’t know this email nor obviously the password, and since it doesn’t allow me to switch email login info I simply can’t play. Been trying to reach PlayStation, but seems it’s impossible.<//review>

The only thing they do on the phone is password reset?? I can do that in 2 seconds from my phone! what do I do when the THIRD dualshock 4 controller ( you know the ones that retail for 64.99?) Starts going bad after 2 months (analog stick drift)? I have gone through 4 of these junky excuses of a controller in less than a year. I don't play call of duty or fortnite the most I've used it is on resident evil 2 and dreams I treat all of my video games so well I don't beat up controllers hell I have an original dualshock that I use on my ps2 all the time and those analog sticks are perfect so what's the deal Sony?< /text>

So I got playstation+ only so the games I have can update in rest mode. This HAS NEVER HAPPENED ONCE in the several months ive had it!! ALL my settings are correct, so don't even suggest I "connect to internet" blah blah blah... what a waste of money!! I don't buy games or whatever else you can do with playstation+, I just wanted the downloading benefits. Horribly disappointing. Not even going to for a refund,  I'll just suggest to all to not even bother purchasing it. A whole years membership for nothing<//review>

Absolutely horrible..

People within the game I am playing are being emboldened by the lack of support and are simply Manufacturing situations that allow them to misuse terms of service by claiming that others are doing the same thing..

ADDITION.. FRI JAN29 2021.

I have recently had my account hacked and within the time the individual had account access they purchased around $130 of AAA content with the linked account/card #..

I never received any notification to change any information on behalf of the account due to the initial intrusion and resulting acquisition of my account..

I contacted PS support and notified them of the hack and the purchased content and regained access through simple steps of verification..

Before ending the phone call I asked the representative what I needed to do to get the illegally purchased content off of my account and that the banking card that was used to purchase the content was canceled to prevent further access and missuse and was told "VERY CONFIDENTLY" that it would be taken care of..

It wasn't..

Its now months after the incident and yesterday night my playstation network account and access to my content ENTIRELY was banned at 4:00 AM without any prior notification or attempts of remediation..

The reason for the ban is that my account was struck for having multiple instances of "Chargebacks" resulting from the cancelation of the bank cards during the unauthorized and "COMPLETELY UNOBSTRUCTED" access of my account which has never been shared or exposed to anyone EVER..

This is negligence..

The fact that I can say I was extorted and then disciplined for that extortion by the mechanism entirely responsible for preventing that initial extortion is completely astonishing and has left me with a fraction of the trust and overall continuity in purchased downloadable content and connecting important financial information within my account to automate subscriptions and quickly aquire developed content..

I refuse to fill out forms or begin petitioning through the methods suggested formally as it would admit or imply guilt of prosses and I am still trying to speak to someone to resolve it..

Im posting this just in case it can be corroborated by other people and potentially linked to a trend as it was right around the holidays and the content was suspiciously focused to blockbuster legacy titles expected to sell over the holiday season..

It is likely the access was granted through exploitation of firmware recently introduced bringing PS5 into the overall ecosystem as the individual was granted access without any of the prerequisite user verification and redundancies that prevent such access..

Regrettably..   a lifetime playstation customer of 20+ years..</text>

Bought a game from the PS Store but didn't get a chance to play it until over a month after purchase because I was in the middle of another game which took 250 hours to complete.  Turns out the game had a game breaking bug which wouldn't allow me to get past a certain point.  Called them and they told me to contact the publisher for a work around.  Did that but the company never responded to my email.  Called Sony back and they still wouldn't give refund.  Told them OK you're not going to give me my $16.32 back then I'm not spending another penny with Sony so I want a refund on my current wallet amount...they wouldn't do that either.

I was just charged automatically for a year of psn the next day i get a NP-40833-8 error code and can't use psn. Tried everything on their website to fix it and still nothing. And there's basically no customer service. I wish i could give a zero rating.< /review>

<Text>No matter what you do to fix a playstation issue there is no solution unless you wait hours. I cant belive they havent fixed some of the bs that is still around. Your section for help fixing issues does not work and has never worked it is utterly pointless. You dont put any valid helpful or reliable information on you consle and dont care about your customer's. Playstation is a joke.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

I purchased Mega Man Legacy 2 for $27 without realizing they had Mega Man Legacy 1 and 2 bundle for $19. So I bought Mega Legacy bundle as well assuming that they would refund me $27.

Unfortunately they wouldn't issue me a refund, because they've refunded me in the passed and it was a one time thing. Not only did I speak to the agent, but I also escalated it to the supervisor and manager, and they couldn't do anything. Not even issue me $27 online credit. You can't even sell the game.

I have to say PlayStation has the worst customer service, especially with refunds and my time and money was wasted.  They didn't even have an sympathy towards me for being ripped off. I'm thinking of writing a letter to the head. I'm thinking when new generation counsel gets realised, I might switch over to X-box , PC or Nintendo. Right now I'm very appalled with Sony. I heard X-Box has better customer service and refund policy.

BTW: I would be more than to happy to delete this review if I got my refund.

Thank you<//text>

Worst customer service that I have ever recieved.  Moders kicking people offline and they accept it like they did it, worthless company. Won't reinstate my account saying it was done by them, when in reality it was a moder ban my account.</text>

My account is most likely hacked and I’m trying to get to the bottom of this issue. Unfortunately it happened on Xmas. They have terrible service and they have no compassion. They say 24/7 support but that’s a lie. I’m going to look into a law suit. They need to be held responsible for their terrible support service.<//Review>

I have never dealt with such unprofessionalism, first my account gets hacked then two days later I get banned for violations of PlayStation network‘s terms and agreements for no apparent reason. I must wait until Monday to get this resolved smh... shame on you PS you should have a 24 hour customer service support<//Text>

Its extremely difficult to talk to a person. All they want to do is send you to a checklist. My bank account has been overdrawn my an unauthorized purchase and I can't even get ahold of anyone from PlayStation support to get any help.<//text>

Your company double charged my account for PlayStation + and when I fought the charges you banned my account! I can’t play any of the games I paid for because of this. Your support isn’t available to assist at all!!! I want to get help with this because now it’s like you have stolen things I have paid for from me</Review>

Unless your Playstation has a warranty, don't send it in to get fixed. Did it 2 times and nothing changed. Very unimpressed. I love the games and the system, but their service center is a joke. Every other experience I have had with Sony has been 5 stars.<//Text>

Absolutely worst customer service experience on a WARRANTY situation!! What on earth is the point of wasting an hour on the phone, wasting the money to send the warranty controller back, to then receive another broken controller...there goes another hour of our time and here's the kicker you want us to pay shipping to send THAT ONE back to you!! Absolutely horrid experience!!

I cannot believe this company is still in business if this is how you treat customers!!< /text>

The worst customer service every experienced. Sent my PS4 to be serviced to get it back still not working. I called to see what was the issue they tell me it was sent back due to a bug not to mention the box my PS4 was in was never opened. Then they say it could of been a bug on the outside if the box due to shipping and it caused them to send my system back without service and they can no longer service the system. This is first class customer robbery to get a customer from under warranty. My system was only played for a week and it stopped working and now they say it's nothing they can do. What makes it even crazier my friend had a system he sent off the week before to get his system back not fixed as well but don't worry this will be my last PlayStation purchase Xbox here I come.<//text>

<Date>1493841689751< /Date><text>I am outraged at the people at PlayStation because they do not stand by their word. We've been dealing with them for over a week and basically they still will not fix their mistake. How can you hold a 13 yr old accountable for their(PlayStation) mistake. I've never dealt with a company that doesn't put the customers needs first. After speaking to supposedly 3 supervisors we were told you have to fix it yourself. I am so upset right now and I'm seriously considering selling my sons PS4 and going back to Xbox 360 or  Xbox 1 because we had a similiar incident happen with them and they rectified the situation asap and also they realized the mistake was made by a child and we weren't punished for it. I wish there was something more I could do to them but unfortunately one against a corporation is nothing, so please be aware when you call their support line because they don't support.</text>< rating>

<Review>Ok. I gotta say something. My playstation is having problems connecting to the home wifi after our power went off then back on. So i called playstation technical support to figure out if there is anything that i couldve done to fix my ps3. Well sadly i didnt get it fixed but was given some insite on how else to possibly fix my problem. I called and was put on the phone with a man name Jairo and he was the nicest support person ive ever talked to. Now the waiting time was kinda sucky but i think it was worth it. We dont see many people now a days that are that kind when it comes to customer frustration. Thank you Jairo for helping me and staying on the phone for 33 minutes lol. Out of 5 stars i give playstation technical support a 1 for waiting time, and a definite 5 star on support operator "Jairo".< /Review></record>

to put it simply, your customer service is actually horrendous.

it started off surprisingly good, given the negative feedback i've seen EVERYWHERE. i was sent a box to send my PS4 in very quickly. it's been serviced at no cost to me and currently on it's way back.

this is where the problem begins. they failed to attach the tracking number in a stupidly "do not reply" email. it was supposed to have a tracking number because it specifically says "Tracking #: ". but that's just it. there's only a space where it should be. like someone forgot to fill it out.

i contacted them on the phone, and they actually hung up on me. nevermind that, but your reps talk incredibly quiet and muffled it's so hard to understand.

so, through quite a long time of searching i managed to find the live chat link. i made sure it was business hours, and entered all of my info correctly. i simply needed to request my tracking number. yet, it didn't work. the live chat had an error that wouldn't see my PSN ID as an actual id. i know it was spelled correctly because i copied it from the actual website.

after trying for an hour on 2 different devices and getting the same error, along with impossible reps over the phone, i actually made a twitter just to contact someone. they then informed me, "we can't give you your tracking number here. try live chat again." which COMPLETELY ignored me trying to get them to help me with the live chat. nevermind that, but it took TWO HOURS for them to reply with that. i understand there are a lot of people, but to offer zero help is actually ridiculous.

so, why earlier i would have offered a good review because it was good service- i'll have to give only 1 star.

the fact you goons can't even manage to remember to attach a tracking number is sickening. if you don't fix your customer service, soon enough you won't have any customers.</Text>

< Review>
I contacted them today regarding charges on my account in which I spoke with Melissa who was awful. Could not give me information regarding the charges when we have no games purchased on our console but $145.29 in charges which doesn't make sense. We will be selling our console to Gamestop and not purchasing any products ever from Playstation. Customer service is everything!<//Review>

I contacted them today regarding charges on my account in which I spoke with Melissa who was awful. Could not give me information regarding the charges when we have no games purchased on our console but $145.29 in charges which doesn't make sense. We will be selling our console to Gamestop and not purchasing any products ever from Playstation. Customer service is everything!< /Review>

<Review>Sony PlayStation demands far to much personal information if you want to register on their website and there is no real way to actually contact them because you get shuttled off to some forum which many game companies are using to derail user input to a rather impotent medium where you do not actually get any company replies or action.< /Review>< Pics>
