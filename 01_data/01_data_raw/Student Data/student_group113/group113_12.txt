<Text>I've been going to this office for about a year now, and am very pleased! The front office staff is always so kind/helpful. I typically see Megan who has been awesome, friendly, and helpful. Monica at the front always helps sort out any issues with insurance, and is also very friendly. I appreciate the various ways to get in touch (call/text) as well as the accommodations that have been made during the difficulties associated with the pandemic. I cannot remember everyone's name, but thank you to all for the care & service!  Recommend :)< /Text>< pics>

<review>I called in to make an appointment for an initial consult last week. A woman named Monika was helping and we agreed on 2/26 at 2pm as the appointment time. She took down my information and confirmed my appointment was booked over the phone. I took time out of work to drive from SF to Walnut Creek today for my appointment. When I arrived, a woman at the front desk blankly told me that I wasn’t in the books and that there PA is very busy on Friday, she wouldn’t be able to accommodate me. I asked her what had happened to my appointment and she told me that it looked like I had called in and rescheduled it. I explained to her that I never called to reschedule and that they must of rescheduled the wrong appointment. She said “yeah I don’t know what to tell you” and just stared at me blankly without apologizing. Another woman walked in and asked what was going on. I explained to her the situation and she started going on and on about how scheduling was out of their hands, and that they’re always having issues with it due to the system they use. Then she went on to say that a former employee, who was let go, was scheduling clients incorrectly, but that again due to the system and this employee it was out of their control. It was not until 5 minutes later that I got an apology. The woman urged me to reschedule my appointment or wait an hour for the PA to be available, but after all this, I will never be coming back here, especially if I can’t even trust them to schedule an appointment correctly. I have a job that is not easy to get time away from, so for me to spend 2.5 hours of my day driving from SF to Walnut Creek was a big deal. I felt my time was totally disrespected, and for that I would never return back here.< /review>< Pictures>

Lovely staff who are helpful, efficient and courteous. The place is well organized and things work like clockwork here. I arrive for  my appointments 10-15 min early and the wait is minimal unlike at other dermatologists. On my last visit I wanted to amp up my Accutane dosage and they listened to my needs. Will continue to come back whenever my skin needs some reviving<//Review>

Over those years, she literally saved my life by finding, diagnosing and removing a highly aggressive skin cancer from my scalp and with her magical laser facial, has kept me looking 15 years younger than my actual age.  Dr. Lee and her staff are the  consummate professionals, you will feel well cared for, valued and understood.  Always on the technological cutting edge of treatment, you know the care Dr. Lee gives you is the best and safest while performed by her with compassionate efficiency.

Count your blessings if you have the good fortune to become Dr. Lee’s patient. I cannot recommend her more highly. Yelp needs another star for such a special person and physician.< /review></record>

Quick, professional and caring. I was able to quickly have a my mole removed by a wonderful PA Mariam. It didn't hurt at all!
The Mohs surgery was done quickly (I was able to get an appointment within 1 week where it takes months for other places) and with great precautions. I also got follow up appointments. The PA called many times to check in and answer all my questions. I choose to stay with this practice and highly recommend it!!</Text>

<text>I've been seeing Dr. Lee for years. So has my father, who's had multiple Mohs surgeries. I thought I'd try something different. So, I went in for a hydro facial. WOW!!! Now, don't expect a "spa" experience, this is a doctors office, so the hustle and bustle of a busy office is the vibe. DO expect to walk away feeling 10 years younger! Michele, the technician who did my facial, was knowledgeable and professional. Dr. Lee's staff were friendly and accommodating.

<text>I call Dr. Lee my fairy godmother because she has gifted me with PERFECT skin! I started going to Dr. Lee 12 years ago when I was 24 years old and my skin has not aged since, her laser light facial truly is the fountain of youth. While other friends my age are starting to get wrinkles and other signs of aging, I am constantly given compliments and jaws drop when I tell people my real age, everyone thinks I am at least a decade younger. My secret? Dr. Lee and her AMAZING staff at East Bay Laser and Skincare. I will be a dedicated lifetime patient of Dr. Lee. Her laser treatments stopped the aging process as soon as I started receiving them 12 years ago, it is a miracle! If you want incredible, flawless, youthful skin there simply is no one better.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1563372628406, 'text': "Thank you for taking the time to leave us such a wonderful review.

I have been to plenty of bad doctors where they rush you through the appt, don't answer your questions, and provide terrible quality ineffective service! You seriously get what you pay for.  I never mind the wait because she's worth it (what good reputable doctor wouldn't have a lot of patients!). Dr. Lee is the top expert in her field, always on the cutting edge, and you only want the best doctor when it comes to your face and body.
I’m a huge fan of her laser rejuvenation treatments where she has removed many years of sun damage and acne scars – I receive so many complements on my smooth skin and youthful appearance and I give full credit to Dr. Lee!  She is my fountain of youth. I wish there were more doctors out there like her who take the time to get to know their patients and make sure they're receiving the best care possible.  Dr. Lee has excellent bedside manners, always greets you with a smile and never makes you feel rushed.  I recently had a big cist removed from my lower right chin and she made sure I understood everything that was involved with the surgery explaining everything in layman's terms.  Throughout the surgery, she would always ask if I was feeling alright.  After the surgery, she contacted me the day after to check up on me and to make sure I was following the post op care instructions.  Thank you Dr. Lee and staff for all that you do for your patients, it is greatly appreciated!!!<//Text><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1563372480067, 'text': "Thank you so much, it's been a pleasure working with you over the years!

Dr. Christine Lee is such an extra ordinary doctor. She is very comforting and reassuring. Her inspirational words gave me the strength not to fear pain and needles.Words cannot describe how grateful I am that you have a very tender touch. I hardly felt anything when you removed the cyst on my back and the skin tag hanging on my nose. You have a special gift as a surgeon and you did such a phenomenal job. Thank you so much Dr. Lee for your great humor, care and attention. I am in awe of your magical skills and your manner put me at ease and helped me gain confidence.

Dr. Christine Lee, you are the best doctor in my books. I will highly recommend you being a brilliant doctor and surgeon. I love and admire your staff. They are all very professional, sweet and very kind.Thank you!</text>

Dr. Christine Lee is such a remarkable doctor that I respect and trust. Thank you Dr. Lee for your excellent care and exceptional professional abilities. I appreciate your caring nature and I adore your loving personality.

I used to associate the word surgery to misery. After being under your care, I now associate surgery with healthy recovery. Dr. Lee, you approach surgery like an artist and you always take your time to do the job right. Thank you very much for taking care of me and being so skilled at what you do. If every doctor is as caring and generous as you, the world as they say will always be filled with smile and laughter instead of pain and sorrow. Your presence is priceless. Thank you for comforting me and taking away my pain and stress. I feel blessed to have come your way. I adore your staff and they are as caring and loving as you are.<//text>

During on of my visits the staff was at the front desk going over their paperwork(s). Dr Lee came up to the desk and said "Oh good, everyone's here, time for a quiz". Dr Lee proceeded to perform a pop quiz, right there, with her staff. The questions were not simple, and yet everyone gave correct answers (I know quite a bit about medicine and patient care).

Continual learning, keeping current, staying sharp.

Dr Lee is highly qualified and intense = as you want your surgeon to be = and the entire crew is great to deal with.

These people are on it.< /text>

Dr Lee is a wonderful doctor. I brought two of my sons to see her, one for acne and one for an acute dandruff condition. I found her through the John Muir Doc directory and after reading her qualifications (teacher/consultant for laser manufactures) I knew that we found our doc. I found Dr Lee to be very smart and knowledgeable. She answered all of our questions and the results were wonderful! I have been singing her praises to all of my friends! She has really given my teen son his confidence back. If you want results go see Doc Lee!!</Review>

Dr. Lee saved my life.  While other doctors dismissed my concern of a changing mole as "vanity", Dr. Lee used her direct intelligence to instruct me to have my HMO remove it.  Dr. Lee was adamant that it needed to be removed and provided me with her long and impressive list of credentials with regard to her expertise in melanoma and moles.  She wanted me to use those credentials to impel my Kaiser physicians to take action.  Indeed, I did have to use her as my expert opinion.  Reluctantly the mole was removed by my assigned dermatologist and several days later I was told it was Melanoma.  I was fortunate that it was caught before it spread and that it could be all surgically removed.  Dr. Lee has laser sharp focus and care for what she does- whether it is a cosmetic or medical procedure/assessment.  For anyone wanting a sincere health professional with astute intelligence I would reccommend Dr. Lee.  She goes the extra mile.</text>

<Text>I have had such amazing experiences with Dr. Lee. She has the biggest heart and cares about her patients. She discovered various skin cancers on me and performed Mohs surgery a couple of times. She took the extra time and care to make certain that the scar on my nose appeared less noticeable. She followed up with lasers to make it look better and people are amazed when they see how good it looks.  Dr. Lee  takes the extra time listen to her patients and discuss their skin concerns. She has great, honest advice, and offers many treatment options. She is a perfectionist and takes a lot of pride in her work.  In addition, Dr.Lee's staff is friendly and professional. I always feel welcome when I go to the office. I have nothing but great things to say about this caring, knowledgeable, and professional doctor.

<Review>Dr. Lee provides the best laser treatments in the Bay Area.  She not only owns a ton of them, she knows how to use them.  Many doctors own lasers, but do not have the experience to yield good results.  Further, most doctors are inexperienced treating ethnic skin.  As a Type III patient, I could not take the risk of putting myself in jeopardy with a laser operator who didn't have the years of experience that Dr. Lee has.

I got the Total FX treatment done last month and can't believe that my ten-year old scar was diminished dramatically.  This is after struggling for a decade trying to get rid of it through treatments such as Affirm, Laser Genesis, microneedling including Infini, TCA Cross, and chemical peels.  Nothing worked until I met Dr. Lee.  My scars look so much better and my self esteem is much higher.  Thank you, Dr. Lee!

Dr. Lee prepared me for side effects that come with lasers, and I'm 100% positive I'm in good hands for getting rid of them.  Not only that, she is helping me with other skin issues I have on other parts of my body.

Anybody who seeks laser treatment must visit Dr. Lee, otherwise you're probably wasting your time and money.  I urge you to check out her credentials/experience and have a consultation with her.  I guarantee you'll be overwhelmed with the amount of knowledge she has regarding lasers.  After all, she works with laser companies and gives lectures on them.</Review>< pictures>

I've been going to the Skin and Laser Treatment Institute for about 14 years now, and learned of Dr. Lee through my rhinoplasty surgeon, Dr. Gruber. I was looking for treatment of my facial blemishes caused by the onset of adult acne. Being olive skinned, my blemishes took forever to disappear or never did.

Since meeting Dr. Lee in 2004, I now have great skin and get a lot of compliments on my complexion and its texture. I’m very happy. She initially put me on a skin cleansing regiment (which I continue to follow) and I see her once or twice a year for the LaserLite treatment. I saw results about six to eight months into my initial treatments, and it really has successfully suppressed my adult acne and blemishes. I’m just amazed that I’m at a point in my life where I can look in the mirror and be happy with what I see. Thank you, Dr. Lee. Sincerely.

On another note, I’m surprised to hear about the negative reviews of the staff, since I find all of them very attentive, pleasant and friendly — especially during the process of my treatments. The negative reviewers may have encountered the staff during a very busy day. It can get really hectic! But if you ever get to know the staff members, they are exactly as I described, and honestly, they're an awesome support team!</text>

I was surprised seeing so many good reviews that I decided to come here for treatment on my keloid scar. First impression first desk was ok, didn't really like how the assistant asked me if I had insurance if not I had to pay the fee  out of pocket (in front of the other people waiting in the room). I waited 30 minutes after my appt to be seen. I go back to the room where I they get more info from me. Then "Margaret" walks in apologies for the wait. Takes a look at my scar and ask multiple questions (reasonable). Then before I hear about any tretment she reminds me I have a fee to pay. Which I already knew that since the lady at the front desk called it out. She tells me she has to talk to "Steve" manager leaves the room and comes back saying what tretment I could get done. After explaining treatment she mentions how much it would be on top of the consultation fee. I mention I didn't care about pay. I tell her I have some questions and concerns. I ask and her answer was " we just went over that" RUDE! She keep running in and out of the room to talk to "Steve" not sure why. She didn't have any answers for me, was rude, kept telling how much it would. I had a bad feeling and told her I didn't want any treatment don. She says "ok I'll walk you out" I follow her and goes to back of the office with "Steve" again I was left in the middle of the office. The front desk lady (diff from the first) went to go get Margaret.  Margaret says to come back in a year. Front desk lady ask if I wanted to book from a year from now.  Margaret replies "no she can do it, oh unless you want to do it know" I paid and left. I felt so disrespected, discriminated service was horrible,  and Margaret was no help, rude,  and was extremely rushed to keep referring to " Steve" leaving in the room multiple times. NEVER RETURNING BACK OR REFERRAL PEOPLE.<//Text>

t can be very scary getting anti-aging procedures done.  You can't help wonder – 'will I end up looking like a frozen faced freak?'  With Dr. Lee you can relax, she knows what she is doing. Every time she has given me a 'liquid facelift', my results are beautiful.  She gives just enough Botox, and just enough Restylane.  I look fabulous, not fake.  Stop searching and go see Dr. Lee.</text>

There is no one better for lasers. She is THE laser person out here. My rosacea is no longer a problem because of the laser treatments she's done on me. I also had 2 skin cancers on my face that she took care of for me with Mohs surgery. Having skin cancer  was very stressful but her office made the experience as easy as possible, and Dr. Lee took exceptional care of me. Highly recommend with no reservations.</text>

Fell in love with this place from the 1st taste. The bill was appropriate. Reminds me of a cafe in Chicago I loved to visit.< /Review>

Really enjoyed my night at 20/20. From the amazing food they offer next door at the cafe to the lavoo hookah we got. Bowl lasted fairly long for 5-6 people smoking it. First bowl we tried 20/20 experience and we got cactus cooler for our refill which both were awesome. Great taste no burn and the waiters and waitresses were so inventive and always made sure we neededanything. Highly recommend for upscale crowd that wants to have fun and enjoy time with family and friends. We will be back!</review>

< review>
I had all too soon typed up a great review about this location on my first visit there. It was the second visit to the location that was an utter nightmare. They had planned a Champagne Party at the establishment and I dropped $$ for hookah, a VIP table and a bottle of champagne. Little to anyone's knowledge they had served alcohol without a license to 2 undercover cops who not only made everyone stop drinking, but were asking for peoples names and numbers and emails and the management made ZERO effort to try resolve the problems. They didn't offer even some hookah to everyone that had their nights ruined because they're idiots with no clue how to run a business.</review>

<Rate>2< /Rate><Review>I used to have fun at 20/20. This time around the menu changed, their selection of tobacco had excluded a brand. Their waitresses were too worried about selfies than their customers and there was a 5$ cover when there was literally no one else in the place.  The music was far too loud, which is normal but a bit annoying especially when the dj turned it to 11 and blew our ears with static.  Also they no longer honor military/student discounts. Not worth going to anymore unfortunately, I last went 1.5-2 months ago at the same time and it was completely different.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80c25b736bcb06cb:0x60c302022d2c9a46< /gmap_id></record>

<review>Never even been to 20/20 Hookah Lounge (no yet). But this is to even out for the   lame post below. How about you move? You live next door to a bar/club and don't expect to hear noise??? Probably should have thought of that before you moved in.

In any case, no need to give 20/20 Hookah Lounge a 1 star since you've never been.< /review><rate>4<//rate>< Name>

<Review>This was my first time here and this place made a lasting impression. In the past, I've gone to other auto shops and had my car misdiagnosed. (Because their intentions was to get as much money from me as possible.) That was not the case here. I brought my car here for a full tune up and they did great. The thing that stood out was how transparent they were. They took pictures and videos of the problems I had with my car. The service manager John was very informative and helpful. They have pandemic protocols in place. I would highly recommend this auto shop because of their transparency and honest intentions. And I plan on returning in the future when my car needs it. Thank you very much!!!< /Review>< pics>

I've been using Greg's automotive for years.  That in itself tells you that I must be satisfied with their prices and work.  This time they replaced my starter.  Truck now starts.  Good job.</review>

<review>I went in for a leaking radiator to be replaced.  The owner,  Greg, was nice on the phone and quoted me one price but when I got a call from John it was $300 more than I was quoted.  I managed to get it $150 lower but John told me I was taking money away from his worker.   As it was they quoted me $380 on an after market radiator that you can find online for $100.   Don’t go here.   I was a repeat customer but never again.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x808562384dcec9e1:0x40e86ba571dd2d76</gmapID></record>

From start to finish my experience exceeded expectations. John walked me through everything at the beginning, a couple hours later they sent me an email along with a follow up phone call and broke their evaluation down into 3 categories: Good, Needs Future Attention, and Needs Immediate Attention and they provided pictures with every bullet point so I could see what they were looking at. When I called back to ask about an issue my previous shop had told me about, John walked out while he was on the phone with me and checked it out himself and gave me feedback. Truly phenomenal customer service.< /review>

My sister and I were visiting from out of town, and we had an issue with our tire. The people here were so nice and helpful! They fixed our tire in about an hour and made sure everything was safe and fixed before they let us leave. They were so gracious and didn’t try to take advantage of the fact that we were from out of town and had to get our car fixed ASAP. I would highly recommend them!<//Review>

The work here is always fine. , but when I came at 9:15 am this time and told them I had an old ailing sick dog and needed to be out by 11:00 I was told no problem. I walked back in at 11:15 and was told it wouldn't be ready for 15 or 20 more minutes and THEN they did not have it ready until 11:50/ not happy  because of my already stressful situation< /text>

<Review>Look no further for your auto services. Greg's Automotive in Lafayette, CA treated me with the professionalism that you just don"t find in today"s automotive industry. John took the time to listen to what I was looking for in a street modification for my Q50S Infinity. He explained in detail my options and what would render the best results John even before i awarded the shop the business had me come in so that he could inspect the car and provided me with a quote for the job. I am so pleased with his shop and work I just had to write a review. Just so you know how much I liked the work, this is the ONLY business I have ever posted...< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

The shop should have mentioned to me that AAA members can receive a discount on labor cost. Nobody there ever mentioned this to me. I only noticed a AAA post up high on the wall when I was about to leave outside of the shop. The shop refused to honor my AAA membership.< /review>

Absolutely outstanding customer service and the most thorough vehicle  inspection I have ever experienced.  My 2004 Jeep is now running like it did the day I bought it.   No pressure sales, I was consulted before any repair or replacement was done and informed of the benefit of the new part and the exact cost, which was very very reasonable.  Great job Eblin and John!  Thanks again.< /review>

<text>Had them do any oil change and tire rotation today. They were very reasonable on price, beat the other quotes I'd received, and got me in and serviced quickly. They also found and fixed a problem that should have been resolved with a service I received from another shop (related to my suspension). My SUV is running better now than it has in a while. I'd definitely recommend this shop.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

In the past I  have had unfortunate experience with mechanics who say they know the car but have sometimes caused more harm. Greg and John are the most honest mechanics I have ever worked with. I live closer to Oakland, but it is worth it for me to get my car to Greg's in Lafayette, even if it involves having to partially paying for a tow. I cannot recommend them highly enough.

<Time>1563655162269<//Time><Rating>1< /Rating><review>Okay. So I took a candy bar and have to review. Haha

I took my car in for an oil change. Took them 4 hours to do it. Longest I've ever waited for an oil change. But that is not my issue with this company. I was called during the oil change and told that my break fluid needed to be changed and they could do it while they had my car. I said no because I had just gotten it done 3 months prior. I wasnt sure which company was lying because gregs auto said that there was no record of the break fluid being changed on my car fax report. So I was worried that the other company charged me for a service they didnt perform. So I called the other company and they said to bring it in and they would fix change it. So the next day I took it to the other company and they tested my break fluid. (While I was watching them and they even gave me the test results)  and it tested clean. My break fluid was not dark at all. It was really clean. Gregs auto lied and made up a problem hoping I'd just say to fix it so they could make extra money. So now I'm completely terrified that they are a shady company so I checked my oil... and it appears that they may have (I say may have because i have no proof) instead of changing my oil they just topped it off. Because its pretty gritty and still appears slightly dirty.  I will never take my car to them again. The service is slow. And they arent honest. If you choose to go here for an oil change check and compare. Meaning look at your dirty oil before you take it in and check it when you leave. If they recommend stuck ask for proof. I.e filters and testers for stuff. I assume they give you a discounted oil change so they can upsell you with other odd maintenance needs that arent really needing change,  or service.</review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

I trust this place.  They serviced my car, prioritizing safety as I'd requested, I feel such a difference in driving it, and John, the manager was patient and not at all condescending when he explained what would be necessary to  keep our old, neglected, back-up wheels running safely.< /Text>

Excellent customer service! I've always been able to call Greg's Automotive and Muffler Repair and ask questions about the problems I'm experiencing with my car. No matter the mechanic, as I describe what is happening they propose potential diagnosis and advise me what to do next. I feel like I'm receiving honest care and they aren't trying to take advantage of my lack of car knowledge to make a buck. I've never experienced any problems with the repairs and I will keep coming back!!!</text>

Nice people but way too expensive. I was charged $127.80 for 4 spark plugs plus $144.00 for the labor to change them. I want small businesses to make a profit but a 5X mark up on parts is outrageous.</Review>

I knew it wasn't the alternator and it was a new battery only two months old. John, who serviced the car was very nice and polite. He found the problem, it was a short in the radio. The following day he informed me that he needed four tires and he got me a great deal on them. He also informed that there were a few more thing that the car needed to run safely this winter which I was grateful for because neither my son or I know anything about cars.

<Review>Recently went here and left my car overnight with no problems. They have a nice envelope to fill out and dropbox. I called them the next day to make sure they received my car. They told me they would get too it soon and call me. They figured out the problem and quoted me the total cost. They told me the hoped to get the part in buy the end of the day and get it done. Greg called me after 5 (they close at 5) and said it was finished. They left my car for me to pick up after hours. Although more expensive, they get the job done right.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x808562384dcec9e1:0x40e86ba571dd2d76< /GmapID></record>

What a wonderful place!
My sister and I travelled from Ireland, to visit our cousin, and his wife in Palm Desert Greens.
It was a great experience!
Lovely people everywhere, great weather, and great restaurants.
We loved our visits to the golf club (bar and restaurant!).
We were impressed with the good order of everything, especially the lack of litter.
Can't wait to return!
Palm Desert is like Heaven!<//review>

I have been a fairly frequent guest of a homeowner over the last few years and I love it every time I visit. The food at the clubhouse is EXCELLENT, the servers friendly and attentive and the grounds are lovely.</text>

A tree owned by the City of Santa Clarita at the end of my driveway had branches that had grown across the driveway. I am moving soon, and a 13'6" high moving truck needs to be able to pull into my long driveway. A different truck that came for our piano couldn't pull in. I contacted the City, and they hired West Cost Arborists to come and save the day, which they did! They trimmed the tree back and left plenty of room for the tall moving truck to pass through, and they were also able to maintain a beautiful, healthy look to the tree. They came well ahead of my moving date, and so now I can sleep at night, knowing that my move will be able to go forward as planned. West Coast Arborists, you are lifesavers! Thank you!<//text>

<text>These are not arborists. They shouldnt even be allowed to have that in their name!
I have 2 mature 50 years + Southern Magnolia Trees on my property.
In 2013 they massacred them!  They cut them as if they were a palm tree.  They did not cut them as you should cut a Southern Magnolia. They took large branches bearing beautiful leaves and took them off at the trunk!
It was horrifying. All my shade for my lawn and home was gone.

These trees are not the City of Anaheim's trees. They are on a Do Not Maintain list and they showed up again, chain saws in hand and butchered what was left of 2 Southern Magnolias trying to thrive post 2013 butcher.

Southern Magnolias are to be pruned not with chain saws, but rather just rounded out on the ends 3-4 ft. Never are the branches suppose to be removed at the trunk unless sick.

My 1 magnolia will never recover and it will take over a decade for the other to provide the shade,  privacy and seclusion to my home that it once did.

The men on the job especially Solomon were rude, and unkind and didn't know a thing about cutting a Southern Magnolia.

2 young crew members showed some sympathy for me as I was beyond saddened by this.

In the 6 years since the last massacre I had devoted twice as much water and 2 hours each day spending time with the trees to help them recover.

West Coast Arborists not only doesn't know how to trim a Southern Magnolia but has people working for them who don't care about trees or the people they harm.

Mind you, on both ocassions I came running out and stopped them! Look at the trees in the after photos..  They weren't done!!!
At what point would they have stopped?

Its not letting me post the pictures, I'll do this by the week end.

Rude and Negligent!</text>< Pictures>

This driver that works for West Coast Arborists (WCA) was driving recklessly down our neighborhood street, speeding, swerving, running stop signs, and almost hit a child! We followed him with our car just to be able to get a few pictures of him and he started to cuss us out. Seems like he was in a rush (unsafe) and had anger problems. Very unprofessional company!< /Text>

<text>I had left a review regarding Wallace Birch, the recycling coordinator. My review was not as fair or accurate as it should have been. Wallace personally came to see me to see if he could provide some assistance. He was professional and polite. I explained to Wallace that I was trying to reach out to him to possibly open another wood yard in the Antelope Valley using my 7 acre property to facilitate. Thank you Wallace for coming out to palmdale to see me. I hope there is a possibility to get a business relationship with WCA in the near future.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Gmap_id>0x80dcd66450d29f15:0x39c8af88f984d3cc</Gmap_id></record>

<Text>The city of HB hired West Coast Arborists in May 2020, and they did a phenomenal job in our neighborhood.  Every tree was trimmed and cleaned and cleaned up after.  The workers, from trimmers to clean up crew were nice and professional with the locals.  The city has trimmed the trees many times over the years, but never has a service stood out so much that I felt compelled to write a review.   I don't know how much they charge, but I can attest to their quality work. Well done.<//Text>< Pictures>

Very professional work. They did an extraordinary job cutting a huge pine tree in my front yard. They are very fast and time efficient, and also very clean. The tree was cut perfectly with no trace whatsoever. The workers are also very nice and helpful, John and Francis handled the job perfectly.< /Review>

<text>Very nice workers. They appeared to take safety very seriously. When I though they where done the guy went back up there and started cleaning the top of the palm  tree with a pick thing. Just going that extra mile to make sure it was all clean 👍</text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80dcd66450d29f15:0x39c8af88f984d3cc<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Pleasure to meet Joaquin and Manuel of WCA today on Alta Mesa Way. They were trimming a carrotwood tree (Cupaniopsis anacardioides) and are subcontractors for the city.

WCA was also spotted on Northwood trimming trees. It's a slow process yet I am becoming familiar with their work. Star rating is subject to change and is just required for Google posting.

After reviewing a recent trimming of a loquat tree an arborist identified some dead wood---also a beautiful bird nest was preserved. Thanks for keeping the city trees healthy.</Review>

The city of La Habra contracted WCA to trim trees on our street. They left a mess of branches, twigs and leaves all over my lawn, driveway and even my vehicles. Looking up and down the street, the mess is not only contained to my yard, but several other residences as well. My neighbor two doors down voiced his frustration as well because he was out there at 7am with a leaf blower and a rake cleaning up their mess. Finish the job guys!<//Review>

For the price and amount of portion... it's too expensive. If they at least gave better sized plates it would make sense. Food tip: Chipotle is a better choice, just add salad and vegetables for less price, and still can get protein.<//Text>

<text>Great service as soon as you walk in. The tofu dish was skimpy on the tofu, especially since.it is the least costly to make of the three main choices and needed to be merinaded a bit longer. The beef and chicken bowls were generous though, our thoughts were they need more vegetable options. Pita chips where stale and hummus runny. Need more bathroom checks.</text>< Name>

Came in yesterday close to closing time and the lady at the counter was very nice in explaining how it works. The food was good however a bit dry. The options are good and I like that there’s several vegetable options. The portions are very generous as well.<//text>

I see this tall kid with long hair helping a customer as he clearly charged her with gloves on. Then he goes on to help on another guest handling food, with out ever changing gloves. It was discusting. He  also touched chicken while shoving it into the bowl with dirty gloves. This was discusting. Please be aware of how this place handles your food. Sadly I had to walk out.

Fresh Griller is a casual and reasonably priced lunch location, but the line gets lengthy and the online ordering process does not run on time. I ordered 3 meals for myself and my colleagues. Everyone including myself really enjoyed our meals. The menu at Fresh Griller is diverse and customize-able so everyone can find a dish they enjoy.< /Text>

This restaurant mimicks chipotles approach to choosing cuisine and serving customers. Salads, Bowls or Wraps are the main options to choose from. The restaurant lists out select favorite dishes or you can make your own from scratch using their ingredients! I had a salad - could choose from two bases and then one warm veggie and one cold. The salad dressing, tomato cucumber cold salad and the chicken were all delicious! I would go back, just without the warm veggie.a<//Review>

<text>I enjoy the variety of veggies. Staff working there are great kids. However the manager Salvador is extremely rude, I approached him very friendly to inform about an incident regarding the food, not complaining, he continue on his lap tap. Pretty much he didn’t care and told me to report wherever to whomever a wanted to.  He rarely served the food and if he does he doesn’t have a clue about basic higiene protocol. To my dismay I seeing him picking up the left over veggies and rice and put it back in the tray.  People like this shouldn’t be on a lead position.  During peak times all staff assist the line while the manager watches from a corner with crossed arms. Fresh Griller deserves better.<//text>< Rating>

Great healthy spot. Way better than Chipotle! Would definitely come here over and over.Tried the steak bowl. The steak was fresh and juicy. Also a lot of varieties for vegetables and different types of sauces. The AJI VERDE sauce is the best. Love the different soda flavors. Very unique compare to other places.<//review>

You can get a bowl, wrap that is either corn or flour tortilla,  you can also do a salad.  The cane sugar soda options are good they even have house made lemonades. The dining area is a good size and not too loud. The restrooms are clean when I've been here.and the staff are very helpful when you can't decide on what you want to eat.</Text>< pics>

4 Stars with room to grow!

This is a healthy spin on the competition. They focus on a farm to table taste versus pushing the organic term.

Rice bowl and salad options galore. Spin them to your taste and be surprised by the various options to choose from. I was surprised to see hummus, grilled mushrooms, cabbage, ... brown rice too.

Go nuts and pick from grilled chicken to vegan choices of protein.

I like this place and hope they open somewhere in the SGV.

Bring your family and friends. There is something for everyone.</Text>

This place is really delicious. I like the way that their food is a healthy alternative to others. They might be a little pricey. If you don't like to eat healthy, yet would like to then try coming here and you'll most definitely enjoy this food.

PS. The pink lemonade is really good. Not too sweet like other places.</Review>

I think is to expensive for what it is. Nothing special. The idea is great but the options and flavors are not good or bad, just average. I used to go the for a vegetarian pasta which I used to love. 😑 New concept, but is not of my liking.</Text>

Ordered the brown rice chicken bowl.  Rated 3 stars due to the chicken not being cooked well.  Chicken was very soft as if it wasn't cooked.  Clean location, great options.< /review>

Try Fresh  Griller and prepare yourself for a tastebud explosion!!! Many thanks to TJ, our server, for preparing (unbeknownst to him) a Dr. Sebi approved alkaline bowl.  "Who's Dr. Sebi?", you might ask??? Well,  jump on YouTube and start your research. Try a bowl with lettuce,  zucchini with apples, mushrooms and onions,  hummus, quinoa, garbanzo beans and avocado.  Simply delicious!<//Text>

<user_name>DeAndre Wilson</user_name><Text>One of the few healthy options in Downey that I have found so far. The food is fresh and has flavor to boot! The bowl and wraps with aji verde sauce are my family favorites. The three stars has more to do with their inconsistent rewards program and misuse. I use to get rewarded a stamp for every entree that I purchase. But they have dramatically cut back and only offer a stamp for every visit. With a family of three I would spend anywhere from $9-$13 by myself for lunch or $27-$35 bucks when I'm running late and choose to get dinner for the fam, this is more often than I'd like to admit, but hey! It's nice to be rewarded a free entree every third visit our so. By my count before I stopped  the frequency of my visits, I would spend anywhere from $200-$325 a month. Oh well, now I visit here maybe twice a month as oppose to 2-4 times a week. The money isn't the issue, it's the way in which they try to reason with you. Mind you, I've seen them stamp multiple times for others, maybe a friend or family I guess. I've never said anything until now. But the management should be aware of this. Be fair, be consistent and be right by your loyalty customers. Without us, what do you have? I use to get all the fatties at work to give this place a try but now I keep my suggestions to myself. I know I'm being petty but isn't that what got me here?<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< user_id>

< Review>
Food was ok, but not worth what i paid for it. I hate the fact that when you try to eat healthy, you get punished for it in paying more for less. It seemed to me that i was getting charged for every single vegetables that was added to my plate. So on the menu, my bowl costed $7 and at the end i ended up paying $16. Yes that is including a drink and i did add avocado, but common, from $7 to $16, thats ridicules. I wish they would at least give a military discount, but thats too much money loss for the company for someone who is willing to give everything for this country and the people in it.</Review>

<Text>I went here for my haircut and they messed it all up. They messed up the hard part. They messed up all of it. They are not sanitary at all. There stations are dirty. They don't clean the brushes or the razors. They don't blow-dry you off after. And they are just good awful.

<Review>I've had mixed results at this location from pretty good to. One side of my hair cut was and inch different than the other and had to ask to have it fixed. Ive since stopped going here and get my hair trimmed elsewhere.<//Review><Response>None< /Response>< username>

<Review>The website says they close at 8pm. We came in and the wouldn’t take us at 455. They continued to wait for someone who called in. They are still there at 530. They just won’t take anyone. Two people were working and No one would cut my kids hair.< /Review><gmap_id>0x8084481f595c12ab:0xea2372259a9417c<//gmap_id><Time>1565223854681</Time><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< user>

Hair was cut badly. Went back and got another cut and they did a much better job. The hair stylist that did the poor cut isn't there anymore. I'm satisfied with them now.</review>

Horrible! I went into this place because I wanted a simple trim up and thought it would be fine. I described what I wanted to keep and she cut it off, so then we had a new plan and she cut that off as well. And then I told her to just shave it and she talked me out of that and I left with a military flat top and hair left all over my neck and face. Three strikes you suck at the ol ball game. Worst hair cutting experience of my life by far.< /text>

They then let 2 walk-ins cut in front of me while I was sitting in there waiting. After 40 minutes of waiting, I had to correct the stylist twice and point out that my sideburns were clipped unevenly.

<Review>I took both my girls and myself to get our hair done. My 10 year old has wavy hair and when i noticed an uneven spot on the side the lady said it's because her hair is wavy. She then fixed it. My 12 year old's hair is somewhat acceptable. But when it came to my cut i had a different "stylist". I asked for an aline i got a very short Bob. I left then called to ask them to fix it. I went back new stylist this time she was pulling my hair and poked my scalp with something. I still walked out unhappy. I went to another shop paid for them to fix it. 80$ later i am satisfied. I will never return to super cuts< /Review>< UserId.>

Buyer beware! Stylist was incompetent. Shampoo was not thoroughly rinsed and the manager (?) somehow said I needed a glaze in addition to the $15 touch-up which is all I really needed. Never told me the cost, so imagine how that extra $50 on the bill made me feel. Then they wanted a $20 tip! I shudder to think what might have happened if I had allowed them to take a scissors to my head! Don't go there.<//text>

Worst run of all the Supercuts I've ever been to.  Chronically understaffed - seldom enough to handle even 2 of the 5 available seats.  Huge wait times.  Twice I've made appointments only to have them blown off because there's suddenly only one barber on staff.  They've even had me wait, apologizing for the delay, only to tell me shortly before closing that they they can't get to me.  Completely bogus.

When you can get in you do get a decent cut, but I strongly suggest you avoid this location if you have _any_ self respect.  Letting them abuse you with super-long wait times and blown appointments only encourages incompetent management...</text>

Sara the manager is a theif. She overcharges highlight jobs that are 50.00 by adding on a additional treatment called a Glaze, which is 50.00. She never offered receipt and played it off as the total price for just a highlight. She scams unsuspecting customers and lies saying it's only highlight treatment. She owes me approx 150.00 to 200.00 for the overcharges. Sara tried to do this to a few other customers but didn't get away with it. I've contacted the cooperate office so they hopefully see in their system how many times she's ripped off a customer, and hopefully  they audit her, and I filed a complaint with the BBB. I want my money for the overcharges refunded to me, and I will be contacting local news station that conducts investigations on businesses who blatantly lie and defraud consumers. The best thing SuperCuts can do is fire her and protect consumers.< /Text>

This unprofessional woman (Danielle) messed up my hair.
(She should be shameful to call herself a hair stylist.)
I’m so embarrassed to even go in public.

I went there walk-in, because near Marketplace. It was big mistake to go this place.
Completely she(Danielle) doesn’t know how to cut hair.
When she have done on my hair cut. I asked to her blow- dry my hair.
Because I realized she did horrible job.
(I was thinking after blow dry, will be better.)
Before start dry my hair, she told me.
“If you do blow-drying, price will be total $45.”
So I said “yes, it’s ok. Do it!”

Oh My God….
I was surprise that she finished blow-drying job within 5 minutes.
(Maybe she didn’t want to blow dry my hair.)

Anyway when I went to front desk for pay for it.
She charges different prices.
She charged crappy hair cut $19 + blow dry/ styling (long)$36. So total: $55

Actually my hair is short hair(It’s above my shoulders. How can say it's long hair??).
And also I didn’t get styling services!

This is totally cheating people!!!!! I never been paid for only blow-dry price for $36.
Is it make sense?

I don’t know why this kind of woman working in hair shop.
(No skillful. Unprofessional. Rude to customers. Crappy Services. She better go back to beauty school to learn more!!!)

Really is the worst hair cut I’ve ever had.
I wasted my money and my time. Will never go there again!!!

If you going to the supercuts. Make sure DO NOT LET HER (Danielle) TOUCH YOUR HAIR. You will regret yourself..< /Text></record>

I have been looking for a good bibimbap restaurant similar to bibimbowl in the bay area. This place has satisfied my bibimbap cravings!

I ordered a bulgogi dolsot bibimbap with no seaweed soup and no mushrooms on grubhub. They got my order correctly! Some places don’t read my comments and usually leave whatever I asked to be removed.

Anyways, the food came fresh and pretty warm! I thought the food would be cold or room temperature by the time it got to my location, but it was fresh still!

The look of the food wasn’t great at first because it looked messy, but the food was delicious to me! I loved it! I think this place will be my go to place for bibimbap! Some part of the rice is crispy rice which was good! I usually don’t like it because it gets stuck on my teeth, but it wasn’t as bad as i thought it would be for this place. I love the fried egg mixed in here as well as the veggies! I believe the sauce is korean chili sauce. I poured some and made it better!

It also came with side dishes as well! The side dishes was good too! Their kimchi is delicious! Some places don’t have good kimchi, but this place tasted good!

The price is a bit on the pricy side, but the amount of food I got filled me up! I still had 1/4 left and I felt full. I did end up eating everything and felt really full. I think it was worth it in my opinion

In my opinion, I would recommend this place!</review>

Food is so tasty, and the staff are genuinely kind and passionate about their food! The stone pot beef bibimbap is amazing, and the spread of banchan (small starter side dishes) are delicious. Definitely get the rice tea – it's complimentary and goes perfectly with any meal. Love this little strip-mall gem – only wish it were open later.<//Review>

Great local place to have authentic Korean food, specialised in bibimpap. Portions are generous and the food is very tasty. Will definitely go back.<//Text>

One of my favourite restaurants in LA, and the signature Bibimbap is the best I've had - I love the other popular Korean restaurants as well, with Park's BBQ and Genwa having pretty good takes on Bibimbap as well, but my favourite is definitely Jeon Ju.

Side dishes are also plentiful and delicious, and service is phenomenal! My favourite server is very friendly and tells us about her son and his swimming competitions :)

Even during COVID, this place retains mastery of the crispy rice crust (I always ask for extra crispy) - I've attached a photo below showing how incredible the crust is, even after sitting in the Grubhub car for a while! (Yes, it's as crispy and delicious as it looks!)< /text>

I got #1 bibimbap with short rib. It was great and kept the heat in the bowl for a long time. All the sides paired perfectly and it was fun to mix and match all the flavors together. Huge portions, I’m taking over half of my bowl home but my male companion finished his.<//Text>

Really good bibimbap. The rice crispiness is perfect, good amount of veg, and non fatty tender meat. Slightly pricy, but it is a pretty hefty amount of food.<//review>

I love this place! It was our first time visiting K-town in LA, and their bibimbap was the best!! It is a mom and pop restaurant in a strip mall, and we were so glad to have found this place! Lots of veggies in our bibimbap and lots of side dishes!< /Text>

<review>BACK OPEN FOR BUSINESS! The stone pot bibimbap actually worked perfectly as takeout. They prepared it really well and scooped the rice at the perfect crispness which is much better than I do myself when dining in. We got the bulgogi and kimchi bibimbaps. They included the appetizers on the side.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_lB-E6pLEI56BOsKSddwq4wyKCi8A_ku9yD42=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<review>Staff was very attentive and friendly which made me feel very welcomed. The food came out quick and with a ton of sides, which for my endless stomach is a dream come true, but was a bit too much food for some of my friends. Food was amazing, just make sure to take you time eating the Bibimbap or you will burn your tongue for sure.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Best dolsot bibimbap!  The galbi dolsot and the kimchi dolsot are my favorites.  Their dumpling rice cake soup is also really good.  Excellent banchans.  The staff are super nice and it feels like solid good home cooking.< /text>

<rate>5</rate><Text>Hands down one of the best Korean restaurants in Los Angeles for Bibimbap. I do not go to any others since they hold the title for being the most authentic and the best. I schedule my physician appointments around coming to this restaurant for lunch so that should tell you something. I have been coming to this restaurant for the past five years and  the only regrets I have is that I did not discover it sooner. Wait staff are very courteous and the food is the best I have had outside of Seoul Korea.</Text>< Pictures>

I’ve had bibimbap in Jeonju, and this one was just as delicious! My only complaint was the portion size! (After eating at restaurants in Korea you come find out American portion sizes can be huge!) Make sure to come with a big appetite to enjoy the bibimbap and banchan at full potential! Absolutely delicious and the price was decent! Highly recommend!</review>

Apart from the fantastic bibimbap entrees, the side dishes(banchan) is on point here.  One of the better, if not the best in service.  You dont really ask for side dishes multiple times as it appears that they replace pretty regularly.  Awesome spot here!</text>

<time>1552878401128<//time><review>There are many restaurants in Koreatown to choose from. This restaurant is AMAZING!! The food, service and quality is superior to any other Korean restaurant I've even been to and I have been to many. If you want great taste and want what feels like a home cooked meal,  you've got to make it this one.

Also, if it was not delicious enough, you also have a great coffee place in the same shopping center and a great Korean bakery across the street.

Love Koreatown!!<//review><pics>None<//pics><user_id>117865058145622181540< /user_id><rate>5<//rate>< name>

Small but clean, mom and pop restaurant.
Friendly staffs are plus!
I had pan fried squid and my son had dumpling soup with rice cake.
Squid had barbeque texture with really delicious flavors and dumpling soup with rice cake made me my mom's food.

This restaurant seems small, but you definitely have to try it at least once! You get a good quality meal for a fair price and you get a lot of entrees with your meal. The food is tasty and the staff is welcoming. Definitely one of the best korean restaurants I've been to and very likely to go there again!< /Text>

I just had late lunch with my mom at Jeon Ju restaurant.  I had Galbi dolsot bibimbap and my mom had Kimchi soup. We both loved our meal and I liked potato salad which comes with main dish.
Waitress were friendly and there was no ballet parking. :)
I will definitely come back with my friends.
Thank you, Jeon Ju !</Review>

<text>Jeon Ju has friendly service, multiple labeled vegetarian items on the menu and high-quality, plentiful banchan (unlimited little side dishes and kimchis). We received six kinds, plus two mini bowls of soup and water kimchi per person. I had the pollock stew and would recommend it if you’re not afraid of big chunks of fish with the bones in them. Glad we ended up here when we decided not to wait it out for Beverly Soft Tofu. ^^</text>< resp>

(Translated by Google) We made and sold cabbage kimchi these days. Kimchi made with anchovy and vegetable stock. It was delicious. Reservations required! I also posted a stone-cooked rice, but it was delicious with the nurungji.

The only reason this company has 5 star reviews is because after your interview they "ask" you to write them a good review before you head out. She will ask you to bring out your cell phone and go to Google and leave a review. I wasn't offered a position, but felt obligated to leave a good review in hopes she would call me back in regards to an open position.

This company knows how to fish for good reviews.< /Review>

This was my first time attending a staffing agency after dealing with another staffing place with very rude workers I felt like I just couldn’t attend one until select staffing! Great place would definitely recommend to anyone! As soon as you walk in they are so kind and friendly making sure you are comfortable and talk you through everything! I was so nervous and they made me feel so welcome I had a great experience!</text>

Great staffing agency with great staff. They called me  to follow up with my appointment and listened to me regarding the jobs that I would be best qualified for. When I first arrived for my appointment,  Maria Vanegas offered me a coffee while I waited to be seem. Then Maria and I sat down and went over the positions they had available. Three weeks later and  I am still waiting for a job and no one has followed up with me :( The interview process went well at first but I went back for an interview last week and it was for a position that I was not qualified.<//Review>

They made so may upgrades to their services. The best feature is the Worklife Academy! If you are looking to move forward with your career, take a look at all the certifications they now have available. Go to the Corona Location and ask for Maria. I couldn't think of a more efficient Representative at that branch.<//Text>

When he arrived, there were 4 others waiting outside because the doors were locked. One was there for a 1:00 appointment.  They called and  could here the phones ring  inside. Very unprofessional. An hour drive and time spent on the computer to not show up for your interviews is unacceptable. A note should've been left on the door if there was an emergency.

<review>A nice and helpful establishment. The staff was very polite, helpful, and answered every question that i had. The online application and short-video exam went by quickly; and the exam was incredibly easy. The staff keeps you updated,by calling you, with available jobs that you have applied for. Also, its a great place to begin for teens who are looking for their first job.</review>< Pictures>

I really was expecting more. Everytime I go to look for a job it's either outdated or I never hear back. People seem not to want to get back with me with opportunities and all opportunities I receive are almost a month old and do not respond. I was hoping at least I would hear back from the office but they seem to always be busy and always want to change my availability when I do call rather than helping me find a job. Disappointed.<//text>

<text>Do not choose this as your next employment opportunity. The people who work here are not at all honest. The jobs they give you are very below any paygrade somewhere else. They failed to explain that most of their jobs are male dominated. Meaning only the men get better jobs while the women are stuck being rushed and not a chance to move up in any company. I had a job that I couldnt stand because everyone there was very unhelpful and unpleasant.</text><user>118170226449663961392<//user><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

They are super unprofessional. STAY AWAY!! I had to wait so long to get seen. Carlotta is very rude and inconsiderate. I had an accident on the 5 freeway and called about it and they decided they don't care and closed my chance to get another more convenient job near me. I have never written a bad review before!</Text>

I found select staffing about a year ago! I loved this place they got me a job as soon as they could but once they moved locations they got new people and they all SUCK!  I stopped working because I got pregnant so my boyfriend needed a job to help support our family! These new people suck! FIRST OFF THE GUY THAT IS IN THE FRONT WHEN YOU FIRST WALK IS IS THE WORSE!!!!!! HE MADE ME FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE THE MINUTE I WALKED IN WITH MY BOYFRIEND! ITS BEEN ABOUT A MONTH AND THEY HAVE NOT HELPED US GET A THIRD SHIFT!  WEVE GINE TWICE AND NO HELP WHAT SO EVER! MY BOYFRIEND NEEDS A JOB SO BAD HE WANTS TO GO BACK TO ASK FOR HELP BUT I TOLD HIM I DONT WANNA GO WITH HIM THIS TIME CAUSE THAT GUY! All he does is stare at us when we're just people who need a job cause we have a family to feed! Sucks doesn't it not wanting to go somewhere where their job is to help you but you don't wanna go cause they don't!!!!!! BELIEVE ME WHEN I TELL YOU ALL THIS CAUSE I NEVER LEAVE REVIEWS BUT IM SO UPSET I HAD TO! I WISH THE SAME PEOPLE WERE THERE THAT WORKED AT THE OLD LOCATION THESE PEOPLE NOW ARE NOOOO HELP!< /Text>< pics>

<Text>It is a Scam place. I would rank "zero star".

It called me to show up for an interview. When I showed up, the front desk lady said there is no job that I want, she didn't  allow me to see the person I talked on the phone. The lady said you can leave you resume here.  Why would I drive a hour to drop off my resume without seeing the person made appointment with me. SCAM!     UNPROFESSIONAL     !    UN-EDUCATIONAL!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcb7f000000001:0xec9cb9acb3b6ae61< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

these place is a very big disappointment as well as a wast of time i went in ready for a 10$ hr job they asked me to go in for only to show up and be told to go back home and apply online,i see no reasion why that could not have been told to me over the phone JUST RUDE TO WAST ANYONES TIME AND MONEY ....KAMRON STAFFING is much more straight forward and deliver great wk opportunity SO I WILL NOT EVER GO BK TO SELECT ESPECIALLY THIS LOCATION<//Review>

<text>Had a voicemail from a recruiter to call back if I still was looking for work. Did just that to get hung up on then called again to be put on hold for 15+ mims. Called a third time to no answer. Horrible service!! No longer interested. Thank God I'm still employed.</text>< pics>

(Translated by Google) They do not pay overtime and to avoid paying they do not answer calls or messages. Already a month and they have never called to say that they are sorry for their mistake and even less pay. In our case, we are going to Small Claims. If someone has this same problem, do not hesitate to go to small claims to make them pay and not get stolen.

(Original)
No pagan el overtime y para evitar pagar no contestan llamadas ni mensajes. Ya un mes y jamas an llamado para decir que lo lamentan su error y menos aun pagan. En nuestro caso vamos a acudir a Small Claims. Si alguien tiene este mismo problema no duden en ir a small claims para hacer que paguen y no se dejen robar.</Text>

(Translated by Google) That excellent attention is paid to you with whatever you do not understand in your application and it is an excellent asset because if they have a job they do not give you just apply before applying the process, they will tell you that they have a job available for you. because I gave myself a very good alluda and the team's challenge here asked them they are always ready to give you alluda.

(Original)
Eselente atencion te alludan con cual quier cosa que no entiendas en tu aplicasion y es una eselente ajencia por que si tienen empleo no te asen solo aplicar aplicar antes de tido el proseso te disen que tienen un trabajo disponible para ti .gracia a la sra Alicia por que me brindo muy buena alluda y el reto del equipo aquien le preguntaba ellos siempre dispiestos a brindarte alluda.< /Text>

Reach us anytime at sjvclistens@sjvc.edu!'}<//Response><Review>My Business Administration Management class was amazing, I learned so much and I am carrying it with everywhere I go. Some people do not like it and so do. My instructor was so brilliant and I am so proud and thankful for him. With his support and all of SJVC workers, instructors, and all around everyone, I was able to get threw this pandemic we are still having and graduate with a 4.0 and being on the deans list. I am thankful for you all. Anyone who wants to go to college for Business or just in general, go to SJVC. They got you covered and they support your every step and decision. They help you become ready for excellency and, help you find a job that you will love and if that job doesn't work out for you they will go over and above to help you succeed and find a position you want and love. Again I want to thank you SJVC for everything and I will be seeing you again soon.<//Review>< date>

I did the dental program in Hesperia. All the staff and instructors were amazing. Except Mrs. St. George. She was rude and picked on students. She was two faced. And I still have no received my packet so I can get my RDA license. I’ve been waiting since May of 2019. And the school still wants to charge me money for something I haven’t even received. I wasted my time.</Text>

I’m now working at two great places all thanks to SJVC and the staff. If you choose SJVC you will be successful if that is your goal. You might be two or ten years away from schooling it’s self.

I went two SJVC the one in Hesperia and the one in Ontario, both helped me a lot. I got my AA in MA at the Hesperia location which was very helpful. If it wasn’t for Mrs Carlos, Mrs White, Mrs Green, Mr Wilkerson,  and my career advisor Steven I don’t know how I would be able to finish. In my opinion, each instructor pushed me to do better and be better. They honestly care if something is up, you just have to communicate with them . I will never for get on where I started and to this day I still keep in touch with some and now I’m on my way to my RN Program!! So thank you SJVC for helping me and pushing me to do more . It is college so don’t sign up if your not taking it seriously because the only time you will waist is yours !

<Review>San Joaquin is a very well prepared school. In the Hesperia campus, the teachers are always there to hear you. They may have a lot of material to take in, but if you have any problems you can ask them and they are willing to help you. It is a great learning environment. I recommend it. The Medical Assisting program is wonderful.<//Review>< Pics>

The school was great but I just wasted 9 months and almost 13,000 dollars on just a certificate, when it should have been a degree where you can find a better job where it really counts.< /Review>

I personally attended SJVC in Hesperia. I acquired my Associate of Science Degree in Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Technology. In just a matter of fourteen months.  I graduated with a 4.0 G.P.A. and I am the Valedictorian of the 2018 graduating class. I could of not achieved my great success with out the help of all the Instructors and Faculty. I highly recommend this college to anyone that wants to make a change in life and succeed. If you are willing to put the time and effort? They are there to help and really care!! I now have a very promising career at West Country HVAC in Hesperia, CA. Thank you SJVC!!< /review>

Always do your own research!!!!! I was signed up and ready to start next month. However, after not feeling 100% sure I did my own digging. I'm so so glad I did!!! I found out from the source (AMT), they no longer recognized SJVC Hesperia as an approved school to take the RMA exam. The Business Advisor from AMT said "They were an approved school but it had expired back in 2016." Not sure why they haven't or weren't able to renew it. So glad I didn't waste 14 months and $32,000 on a degree I couldn't use in the medical field. Do your research for approved All Allied Health schools and go to those ones.<//Text>

When i went there as a student they made sure everything is going well and keeping on top of everything now that i graduated its like i dont exist anymore . Dont get me wrong alll of my instructors for MA were amazing its the staff u need to worry about i kept calling becuase a payment i made to sjvc shouldnt been withdrawl from my funds if they new that i wasnt going to have to pay them i called three times amd the receptionist keeps sending me to finacial aid and no one is never there all i wanted is a refund now im five days late becuase of sjvc how can the receptionist take my payment but not a refund . I called again and she hung up on me i willlllll NEVER recommend ANYONE to this school ever ! You guys need to throw away the whole staff and hire new people they are very rude especially when i go in ! Instead of helping me i stood there like a dumbass waiting for them to stop with there gossip im so tired of dealing with this school its actually not the school its the people there . IM NEVER late ony any of my payments now my. Credit is going to go down again becuase of this school ! I swear i regret going here . If this wasnt the closest school to my home i would never gone here .< /Text>

I have never pictured myself going to college. I did not even know what college was in grade school. Going to SJVC has literally changed my life. When I first started there, my first Module was an injections class. Crazy right? But thats what I loved most about it. I am the type of learner that will only learn having hands on training. I learn by getting thrown into a shark tank and thats exactly what they did. and for that I cherish them. It was a long, hard, and crazy experience my 15 months of being there. I went in to get my associates degree in Clinical/Administrative medical assisting. I came out with that and the knowledge of a doctor. When I did my extern module, the dr I had externed for said I have a brain of a surgeon and It is all because of SJVC. I maintained a 4.0 my whole time I was there. (piece of cake) lol. I am now A scribe for a Dr and work for multiple specialists in a company I never thought I would be in. All thanks to SJVC. I definitely recommend to all my family and friends. (MRS RUTHERFORD WAS THE BEST PROFESSOR IN ALL MY TIME OF BEING THERE). xoxo< /review>

<Text>The education I got at SJVC Hesperia campus was amazing. Not only are all of the teachers extrememly helpful but they genuinely care about your success in school. Even after you've graduated many teacher's continue to lend a helping hand and are willing to give advice when it comes to trying to find a job.<//Text>< UserId.>

<review>Amazing and kind staff, thanks Sage for helping me. As well as the others who were busy in the back. The store was clean and open , options were good on the snack/food cooler, cups were cute and well presented, and my drink was amazing! Bathrooms are closed due to covid tho. Thanks again!</review>< pictures>

<Review>As someone who frequents a variety of Starbucks in the area, this is one of my favorites. The baristas are all pleasant and fun in personality plus the restaurant had lots of room with multiple chairs, tables and wall plugs so everyone has space to study and relax.<//Review>< rate>

<text>This location seems faster than the 5 other drive thru Starbucks in the Colton area. The older you get the faster the faces seem to fade from your life. I recognize the faces here so that's reassuring. It helps that they're nice too.</text><time>1586628620559</time><user_id>104221714854282523051< /user_id><username>Brian Stackhouse< /username></record>

< Review>
This is the best Starbucks in Colton. The baristas are friendly and knowledgeable. There's a Starbucks right down the street from my house, but I go further and out of my way to this Starbucks because they're so much better.</Review>

They are always on point. I go during the morning rush when everyone and their mom is going. The baristas are still very helpful and understanding of those who dont know the menu and they make the experience personal. Most places when they get a rush rush the customer during the order. It is always quick service whether you use the drive thru or go in.<//Text>

<Review>Very nice staff, I really appreciated that upon having to wait quite a bit for my mobile drink the shift lead took the initiative to give me a 4 dollar SB card for my time. Greatly appreciated. My drink was delicious, thanks.</Review><user>100005246918398769107</user><pictures>None< /pictures><Name>Johnathon Shaver< /Name>< Time>

<review>Walked in on a not too happy day, have alot going on. Manager walked up excited out of her mind to help me lol dont usually see that alot now a days. Took my order, hooked it UP and mentioned that she made it with love for me. As corny or as cheesy as it may seem, she genuinely made my day end on a good note. Having a BOMB drink (star rewards, pumpkin spice frappuccino with an added double shot) made my day THAT much better. Keep at it miss, doing a HECK of a job!!!!! Definitely going back tomorrow and most definitely recommend going to get your dranks here!<//review>< GmapID>

<Text>It's not the first time they have messed up my mobile order. I've had to wait around 10-15 minutes before I got helped. They also always seem to run out of berries all the time. I've avoided coming to this location because of that although the people there are nice and friendly.</Text>< pics>

This Starbucks is absolutely a pleasure to go to! I work close by and have another Starbucks next door to my work and I prefer driving to this location then walking to the one next door! This location is a great example of what customer service is all about! I had the pleasure of being served by Peter in the drive thru and he just cheered me up! I was irritated with the other Starbucks on Washington and he turned my attitude around! So thank you to whoever is running this store! I applaud you and your team! Keep up the great work!<//Review>

Update... keeps going down hill. At this point it has to be deliberate. Another cup with lid placed over seam? Plus the coffees HORRIBLE.  I dumped it out after 2 sips.  Nothing like any other location,  bitter and nasty tasting! How do you ruin drip black coffee. I kept going back because I thought how long could they continue like this?   Tiday I have my answer...as long as it takes. From eye rolling at coworkers after a simple request to placing the lid over the cup seem.... Shirt ruined, then at the bottom of the cup... Grounds (and I my mouth thank you). Come on corporate can't you do something about this one?<//Review>

<Review>As a Starbucks place itself, I would give it five stars, but unfortunately the area of that location is an attraction for many beggars and junk people.. I had a guy last time that wanted to sit with me on the small table because it was close to an electric outlet, so i had to leave the place because he has no idea what other people privacy is. When I left he said in a "nice" way: "starbucks is for everyone man" so i had to say sorry for him and leave. On top of that, u'll run into beggars almost every time u walk in. So trashy people out there.. Definitely won't go back there ever..< /Review><date>1422475646992</date></record>

Very poor experience here, I'm not even out of my car and I'm harassed by some homeless looking Guy asking for money hanging out with bike and bags. Cussing at me because I didn't give him money. Manager gave us a free hot chocolate for our troubles.  Starbucks are attracting bums here and the store I go to in Fresno, going down hill Starbucks.</text>

<review>This Starbucks is just okay. The music is loud and so are the baristas. It's kind of dirty too. The caramel macchiato didn't take like one but more like a vanilla latte.<//review>< user_name>

Professional, polite and fast service. My second visit to this location and the WONDERful Barista personalized my perfect FlatWhite. Tasted better than it looked.< /text>

<response>None< /response><text>There was a long line..pretty typical at any starbucks, I know.  When I was up to pick up my order there were only 3 people working!  I knew then that was the reason for the drive thru line to go so slow!  They made my drink perfectly and the girl at the window was very friendly and nice...but Starbucks should know how busy theu get and theu should have more people working!!!</text><Date>1513581352723<//Date>< Pics>

< Review>
Horrible wait time and service!!! I went to this Starbucks to get a XL Narino, and to try something called a "Medicine Ball" that was recommended by a coworker. The drive thru like was very short, only 3 cars in... as Soon as I pulled up to the mic, the young woman first said I'll be with you in a minute, after 2 minutes she said thank u for waiting and asked can she get me something warm, I was like sure let me get a brownie, they were all out of brownies! Ok? Then let me get a banana nut bread, all out as well... ok?! Then I get Nothing, just get me a XL Narino, she said "we don't make that here"! Even though it's clearly on their menu!!! Ok, let me get a medicine Ball, Oh we don't have anything to make that?! Out of frustration I ordered the first thing that she recommended cuz I was irritated!!! After 15 minutes of waiting I finally left what was suppose to be a quick sip</Review>

I love it here. The baristas are always nice and friendly. The Wi-Fi here is google so it's really decent. Never and I mean never been mistreated. Spacious sitting area and plenty of outlets. It's always clean. Best Starbucks in and around colton and San bernardino.< /Text>

It's a Starbucks.. So there's that. Didn't like that my friend and I stood at the counter for a while before being greeted and then finally helped. There were also a lot of transients taking up chairs and charging their phones< /Review>
