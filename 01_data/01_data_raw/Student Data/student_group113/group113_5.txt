This was my second time using Precision Temperature for AC repair and maintenance. I'm extremely pleased with the work that was performed. My first repair in October 2020 was by a technician named Carlos and my second repair was in May 2021 by a technician named Marco. Both technicians took the time to explain in detail what the issues were, how the system is supposed to function, and what it would take to repair. I really appreciated them taking the time to answer all of my questions above and beyond. Both were extremely professional, respectful and on time. They also completed the work quickly and correctly, spending extra time making sure everything was secured, sealed and protected. On my second repair, I needed an entire new breaker box for my AC. Marco did a great install and it really looked nice when it was finished. He even made sure it was properly sealed and within code. I have been extremely satisfied with both repairs and will continue to use Precision Temperature exclusively for my HVAC needs thanks to Carlos and Marco's extreme professionalism, attention to detail and the knowledge they provided me as a homeowner. Bree was also great at taking my appointment request and answering all my my questions and concerns, she was very friendly and helpful and did her best to find me the earliest appointment possible.</review>

Callahan was out to replace my old thermostat with a smart thermostat. He made sure to cover up where the old thermostat was at so we didn't have to repaint. He helped me download the app on my phone and walked me through how to use the app and new thermostat. Overall very thorough and friendly, would highly recommend!!</Review>

We had such a good experience! They gave us the whole rundown, even went on the roof to check out what was really going on. The technician that came out showed us pictures and videos of what was wrong, so in no way did we feel deceived or lied to. He was very honest and gave us a great detailed description of what the next steps looked like. I would highly recommend!< /text>

Great Experience! Callahan was so friendly and professional. Very knowledgeable! He explained everything that was going on with my AC and gave me options for my budget. I love that he never tried to up sell me and was honest. My whole experience with Precision Temperature was Amazing! From booking my appointment and speaking with the friendly staff on the phone to the quick repair of my AC and replacement of my thermostat. My family is happy that our AC is up and running even better than before.</Text>

We had very good service from Admon Yousif, and the recharge of one of our two compressor units seemed to work. We will find out in time if this is adequate for our needs. It recharge seemed to allow the refrigerator unit to provide a lower temperature by about 10 degrees to minus 30 F. Tests will come in a day or two with our own theromistor readings.<//text>

<text>The technician, Calahan, did an excellent job of installing a thermostat and repairing the heating system in multiple units on our property.  He was professional, knowledgeable, and made sure to explain the details of what needed to be repaired in the units, and all available options,  to the management office before completing the work.  Calahan also took the extra time to show the tenants in the units how to properly use the thermostat, which was greatly appreciated.  I would recommend Precision Temperature and their services.</text><name>Kathie Rivera< /name><time>1611852744257</time>< Rating>

had central air installed in my house in PB. This was a brand new install, so all the duct work and everything had to get done in a VERY tight space. These guys pulled it off for at a really good price point. The lead tech, Dalton, and his partner were super cool as well. Felt very comfortable having them in our home, and knew they were delivering a high quality install. Definitely recommend these guys!</review>

Admon was on time, and quickly identified the problem. He was fast in procuring the replacement part and had everything back together in about an hour. He wore his mask while in our home and he did not try to up sell us on unneeded items. Impressive!

Came home from traveling to a broken A/C and a very hot house.  After calling 5 companies - Precision was the only company that actually Went out of their way to send Carlos out the same day.  Carlos, was outstanding, educating me along the diagnosis as well as the repair.  House is now cooling down like it should be during the hottest week of the year.   Highly recommend!<//Text>

Precision Temperature was able to provide quick service on a three day weekend at a reasonable price.  Admon Yousif arrived on time, quickly diagnosed the problem and made the repair.  He also notice that the condenser fan was running backwards, something that was original to the installation 10 years ago.  He didn't have the correct part to fix the fan correctly, but came up with  a suitable work around to carry us until the next day when  he returned with the correct part and fixed the problem.  I would highly recommend this company for any air conditioning problems as I will use them for any future problems that I may have.<//text>

Sam from Precision temperature did a fantastic job of maintenance on my 20+ year old heat pump. The next day when there was a slight issue with the Unit, Sam returned and spent time ensuring that all connections were clean and clear and that there was no failure.

I would highly recommend Precision Temperature as the HVAC company to use for maintenance of your air-conditioning and heating equipment.</Review>

We had a bad circuit board in a 40 year old furnace.  Sam Crawford and Albert Bernal diagnosed the problem, found a compatible new board, and installed it all in the same morning.  They also found and fixed a faulty pilot light and had the furnace running properly.  They did a great job.  I highly recommend Precision Temperature.< /review>

Our AC went out in 100+ degree temperature! Precision Temperature responded right away to our request for a quote/appointment. We received a text when the tech was on his way and a picture so we knew whom to expect. Marco, the AC tech, couldn't have been friendlier or more knowledgeable. He quickly diagnosed the problem. We are new homeowners so he was kind enough to walk us through some tips and tricks to keep our unit running its best. I highly recommend Marco and the rest of the team at Precision Temperature!!<//text>

Charges $400/hour to replace a compressor. They tell you they charge 85/hr for labor. Nope!!
3h labor compressor replacement, you will get $1200 bill + parts lmao. Do NOT trust their hourly rate, it's all a joke. Calculate how many hours this fool spend and prepare to pay at least $250-400/hr for their time. Use this company if you wanna get rip off LOL</text>

The Technician, CARLOS MENDEZ was at my door at 8am. I was promised an appointment window between 8am -10am. Great timing! They were neat, clean and very professional. After replacing my entire furnace in just a few hours, Carlos took the time to teach me the basics about my new purchase.
I highly recommend these folks.< /review>

The Technician, Sam, came out to provide a quote for my MUA/Swamp Cooler to be serviced and he ended up providing me with additional information/tips/resources that I had no idea about! Extremely helpful, knowledgeable, and professional! I ended up moving forward with a few service suggestions in regards to my HVAC unit. However, I am still awaiting a quote for few other services. Amazing job Sam, I look forward to doing more work with this company and Sam!< /review>

I had a warranty service call call today. Called on Friday and Marco was here promptly at  8am as scheduled. Promblem was repaired and tested. Marco had some time and fully answered all questions that my wife and I had. I now have a better understanding about  the system and was given some helpful tips on temp settings and maintenance.< /review>

This was the third time I used Precision Temperature over the past three years for annual maintenance and other issues. This year Frank Herrera listened very patiently and courteously to the problems I was having and took steps to insure everything was successfully resolved. Just as we have in the past, we found them to be an honest, trustworthy heating and air company and I recommend them to anyone needing their services.<//Review>

<user_name>Erin OBrien</user_name><text>We were referred to Precision by a former employee. Our first contact with the appointment scheduler on the phone was good (polite, friendly, listened well). Jonny B was the estimator who came out to talk through options. What a great guy. Knows his stuff and answered as many questions on site and later by text. Prompt for the appointment, friendly, courteous, and patient. Didn’t push anything on us and told us what we didn’t need that others had suggested we did.  Jonny assured us that his install crew would do right by us and they did! Dalton and Chase worked all day from 7:45-5:30 installing a new HVAC system. The two of them worked well together and seemed to coordinate their different tasks (indoors and outdoors) like a well oiled machine. They were friendly, clean, careful in our home, answered all questions and didn’t mind that our big dog wanted to help them all day!  Precision should treat all three of these guys to lunch. There is no better PR than the folks who come into your home and do a great job! Next week’s high temps will be the best test of the new system. Looking forward to it after a summer of no AC.  Precision also has a great website to educate on the different aspects of HVAC systems.  Very helpful!</text></record></dataset><record>

<review>We had some problems with our heating unit. It was replaced by another company who had not taken the appropriate steps in installation leaving us with a heater that was leaking gas.  Marco from Precision quickly identified the leak, reinstalled the lines, tested it and took the time to explain the steps he had taken and why. It is important to be confident in the professionalism of the company when you are dealing with something as potentially volatile as a gas heater.  I would recommend Precision.<//review><name>Doug Field<//name><resp>None< /resp><user>102116769434958312554<//user><Rating>5<//Rating>< Pictures>

Chuck was absolutely phenomenal. He quickly diagnosed and solved the issues with our machinery. We had 5 other companies try to service our machine and Precision Temperature was the only company who actually helped us. We were beyond impressed with his professionalism and expertise in his ability to diagnose the problem quickly. Precision Temperature came out SAME DAY, at 9pm on a Saturday evening. 6 Stars if we could give it!<//review>

<text>👍 They came to clean out our air vents and did an awesome job. These guys were definitely professionals, knew what they were doing and it showed. They even vacuumed and wiped down everything after the job was done. 😊 I have 2 kids under 2 and it was so nice to not have to clean after they finished.<//text></record>

<text>Dalton Holyfield and his assistant (didn't get his name) did an outstanding job in replacing my air/heating system. They both were very professional and courteous, and were very helpful when answering my many questions.  With employees such as these, and including the salesman, Jonny, I will continue to do business with Precision Temperature.<//text>< Response>

<review>In preparation for Thanksgiving dinner, I turned on the heater and felt that it took too long to heat the house… I called Precision Temperature and they came out to check it out! Technician Marcos Magana was in our home and recommended a preventative maintenance for our furnace. Marco was very knowledgeable, very efficient and did an excellent job! After doing the maintenance on the furnace, Marco tested our system and it got hot fast!  Kudos to PRECISION TEMPERATURE AND TO MARCO!!</review>< Pictures>

Oscar came out to clean our registers and perform a de-fogging procedure to help kill any mold and smells coming from the system, after we had a flood in the area. He went above and beyond crawling through the attic like a spider monkey to check the integrity of the ducts before starting, and adjusted the vents while up there. He was thorough and professional, taking care to move any belongings to keep from being damaged and covering others to protect them from dust and debris. He cleaned up after himself and left the areas better than he found them. I would gladly use Precision Temperature again and would easily recommend them to anyone with HVAC needs.< /text>

Quality service and products.  The most affordable out of the 3 estimates that we got for a new HVAC & furnace combo unit, moved to our attic for quieter operation.

Would recommend.<//Text>

It's very hard to find people you can trust these days, let alone do a fantastic job when they arrive. Every employee that I have dealt with was polite and professional. Just today, Manny repaired a unit of mine that other companies had issues with fixing. He did it with a smile and was very courteous to answer my million questions. Thank you guys, and we will be doing more business with you in the future.<//review>

Summer is coming and the A/C just wasn't blowing cold anymore. I called Precision Temperature and they set a diagnostic appointment for the following morning! Marco arrived right on time, and dove in to diagnose the issue. He was able to find and fix a leak, and recharge the system in under 2 hours! He was knowledgeable, friendly, and quick! We chatted while he worked, and I learned a lot about how to keep my A/C blowing cold for the rest of the season. Thanks Marco!< /Text>

< Review>
We had Precision come out last July after our first heat wave to install AC to our home. Mike came out and spent time giving me an informed quote that was a great price. The install was quick and the whole crew treated my family like we were their family. The system cools our home perfectly and the electric bill didn't spike too bad at all!! They were easy to get on the phone both before and after the install...we decided to add a duct to our garage apartment. I would recommend Precision to anyone looking for a local company with great prices and even better service.< /Review>

<text>Had a problem with our LG mini split.  I installed the system myself about 3 months ago and just recently started getting CH error codes.  I was a little hesitant to call the pro’s because I did the install myself but, The error code descriptions that were tripping were a little above my skill set so I decided to give Precision Temperature a call.  We called on a Monday and they came out on Thursday (the soonest they could come out was on Wednesday).  We were given a 8-10am time window and the tech arrived at 8!  The technician Carlos was super friendly and very knowledgeable, he helped me out with every question I had!  I feel as if Carlos went above and beyond in his performance and due to that reason if any issues ever arise with our mini split in the future, I will definitely be a repeat customer with Precision Temperature and definitely request for Carlos!
(Error codes were CH02 & CH35)<//text><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

Our Family held an EASTER PICNIC at this lovely, well maintained park in PLAYA VISTA (Bluff Creek and Lincoln Blvd).  We played paddle board on the basketball court, since the hoops were not available.  The grass was soft for napping and there was a good size children's playground on site loaded with kids and parents.  There are convenient public bathrooms, patrolling security guards and dogs walking by on their best behavior.  Good variety of activity taking place.  All appeared to be enjoying the day.</Review>

It's a great place to have a barbecue and hang out with friends. I came here once with friends...we played a little game of whiff ball as we grilled some hamburgers and hot dogs.

Park has football field, baseball field, tennis courts, basketball court and children play area. But no much space for lying on the grass.< /Text>

< Review>
My favorite city park ever.  I walk/bike through here several times a week and still haven't discovered all the lil hidden coves or explored all the museums.  The perfect urban escape, without having to actually leave the city.</Review>

<rate>5</rate><Text>This park is one of out favorite places to go with the boys I nanny. The parking lot can get busy, but there's always been a spot for us. The playground is fully enclosed with fence and a gate, and there are benches and a few tables all around. The bathrooms aren't exactly nice, but they are well maintained, and it's nice to have them. They recently had taken out the baby swings and the accessible swings, but they're back up for now!</Text>< gmap_id>

<UserId.>102776057196808069287<//UserId.><Review>Arrived at the park to enjoy a peaceful breakfast by myself found a nice empty grass area just adjacent of the basketball courts. I was Disturbed and rudely surrounded by hula hoops soccer balls obstacle course contraption that were being set up by the gentleman who apparently charges the community two exercise and get the kids moving without a proper permit .  i kindly ask the gentleman did I need to be worried about getting hit in the head while sitting down eating my breakfast his rude comment is what disturbs me the most, well yes ...   I do this all the time I asked the gentleman do you have a permit to hold these paid for sessions he replied no so he moved over just a little maybe about 10 feet away and continue to set up his obstacle course there were other areas that were bare of grass and I just found it to be very rude of him on a Sunday morning to be very inconsiderate about the fact that I was trying to enjoy my Sunday morning breakfast so if you visit this park make sure you don't see a gentleman and a Truck setting up obstacle courses completely around you and making money on city parks without permits.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Large play structure for kids. The ground is the squishy rubber stuff, which is so much better than sand. An ethnically diverse set of parents and children come here.

The basketball court, tennis courts, and grass field are often in use; I enjoy all of the activity that goes on here.</review>

This is a really good park but on weekends parking can be scarce. There is a large field that is rented out for children's soccer and football leagues and there is a really nice fenced in playground. This is technically private property so there is almost always a security guard nearby. There is also a trail running along the back of the park that lets you experience how the property was before it was developed. We go there a lot but, parking can definitely be a problem.< /text>

Not a bad park. Came for a event and found it was easy to get in and out of. Seems like it can get packed on the weekends and holidays. As usually adult soccer leagues seem to rule the park. How interesting is that you can’t play catch with your kid but you can watch 50 year old men play football.<//Text>

<text>Nice safe park with basketball courts and new mommy meet ups.
The park is always busy, unlike other parks in the area they sketchy people dont seem to loiter around here for whatever reason.

The park is clean and there is plenty of space for families to stretch out.
Parking can be tough especially on weekends<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

It's a lovely park with lots of plant life.  I'm not use to having so much security patrol a park, but I guess the community in the area appreciates it.  They have a dog park not too far; it's a part of the running trail which is amazing because you get to stare at cute puppies while you go for your morning jog  :)</Review>

Gorgeous but doesn't allow dogs?! Even though the trails that run along the perimeter and all these new tech offices and apartments/condos adjacent do? It literally makes no sense.

I hope someone has started a petition to change that.</text>

Positives:
-there are two gates, both on one side of the park where there are always guards to ensure no kid wanders off on their own
-no sand, sawdust, or other nasty park dirt that comes home in the car and into the house
-rubber padding underneath the entire structure
-the swings actually work here (most new swings slow kids down and require excessive pushing/pumping)
-the kids love the structure and always find other kids to play with
-areas to sit in the shade or sun and a nice grassy area to sit as well
-rumor has it the park is regularly sterilized!
-bathrooms are always stocked and reasonably clean for park bathrooms and all have changing tables
-great mix of people from all over and most are pretty chill
-there are usually a fair amount of dads or male caregivers with children at the park (as a stay at home dad, this can be important)
-always entertaining to watch the games on all sides of the park (soccer, tennis, basketball, and baseball/softball)

Negatives:
-the rubber padding can be hot to the feet on hot days so socks or shoes may be required
-parking lot can fill up during sporting events or when the neighboring school is being let out, but street parking is almost always available
-due to the proximity to the ocean and marina, it can get windy and cool down rather quickly, especially as evening approaches<//Review>

<userid>111280671573743085399< /userid><Review>Great park it has a soccer field, softball field, tennis court, basketball court, and a tot lot (jungle  gym). They have a security guard since it is private property but it is open to the public. Security guard is there 24/7, there pretty cool guards. Parking during the weekend is really difficult, so be worn. Also since it is a private property they close the park at dusk. So, they are able to kick you out. For those people who bring there dogs be advice ur dog has to be on a leash at all times, and no pets are allowed in tot lot, soccer field, tennis court ,and softball field. There are public restrooms to but they close them after close the park.< /Review><GmapID>0x80c2b091a6b9983d:0xf449fe503cde1c8d< /GmapID><response>None</response></record></dataset><record>

This is a very nice park. There is a fenced in playground that does not have sand. There are bathrooms with changing tables right outside of the playground.< /text>

<review>It has trails, about two one upper and one lower. The upper one is concrete and you can enter from Lincoln Blvd near LMU and there's lower trail is dirt. People walk their dogs and they must be on a leash, but most of the ppl saw ignored the leash ordnance. It's rabbit and squirrel wild life and beautiful ducks and cranes and other water fowl there. I ed out myself everytime I visit.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Nice area to catch some Pokemon with bathrooms and drinking water. The creek is much more natural-looking than most of LA. Just be careful where you step and stay on trail.< /Text>

My family watched the marina fireworks from the park because Lincoln Blvd was closed to traffic going to Marina del Rey.  The show was only 20 minutes long and during that short period of time we experienced a flea attack that was extremely uncomfortable!!!  I find it hard to believe they do not allow dogs on these premises.  I feel so sorry for the children who may have been bitten that evening as well.</review>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>This is my favorite place to go to get my car detailed, they always dial it in perfectly. While I’m waiting I walk across the street to Wood‘s Cove my favorite Cove in Laguna Beach and put my feet in the water and walk around, it makes the time go by faster and before I know it it’s time to go back up and get my car which is perfectly detailed with armor all every time and they always vacuum it and make sure the rims are cleaned. They also have a great patio to sit and wait if you don’t feel like walking on the beach. I highly recommend this place.< /Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
I do not write reviews. However, I took my SUV to Sweetwater Car Wash in Laguna Beach on Wednesday to get my car washed and vacuumed to be clean for my daughter’s graduation on Thursday. I even paid extra to have the dashboard and console wiped down. I waited an hour to get my car. When I got home, I discovered that the dash board and console were barely touched. (I couldn’t tell in the bright sun as I left the car wash. It was only in the shade of my garage that I could see clearly). I called my daughter out to the car to help me check. We not only discovered that the front dash and console were still dusty and dirty, but we also discovered that the back seats and carpets were not vacuumed at all. We both had to re-vacuumed and clean most of the car. I could have paid $8 at Costco for pretty much the same level of cleaning.< /Review>

I got the “manager attention wash” and they did a terrible job. Didn’t even look like The vacuumed the inside and the exterior had streaks on the window and had been very hastily done.

I go back a week later to resonantly discuss it and with the full intention of trying again. Whistled for there to be nobody in the office but the manager. He told me “No, no, no. you didn’t get wash” I got the manager attention wash?!?! He just looks down at his book and ignores me... bad business.

I wouldn’t give these guys a dime.</Text><Response>None<//Response><UserId.>118264501196177248660< /UserId.><Pics>None<//Pics><Rating>1</Rating>< time>

I have been there twice. The wash is sub par. I have gone there when I need a wash close to home. Both times my truck has not been cleaned right. Will not go there again. A drive thru car wash does better then they did.<//text>

Finding a place to get your car washed is like finding a place to get a haircut. This is the best car wash I’ve ever been to. It’s Nice knowing that they treat my truck the same as some of their other clients who have cars worth a quarter million< /text>

<Review>Very fast (like its name says it) and high quality car wash with a friendly staff. Your car comes out clean and shiny and you'll just need to wipe it off. They have free vacuum but make sure you're not going there on a weekend cause it's very crowded and they don't really let you use it.</Review>< Pictures>

I love Sweetwater mainly because they never try to upsell me.  I could go to other car washes closer to my home, but I can't stand how they try to upsell me all the time.  I've been coming here over 10 years.  Awesome work.< /review>

Came in for a car I found on Carfax unfortunately it was sold by the time I got there. I did however find another vehicle which was in great condition. Low mileage. Clean title. Everyone at the location was very helpful and nice. I didn't feel hassled. I walked out with a great price on a great car that even came with free Roadside assistance for a year. My 5 year old loves it and I do too! 😊< /text>

Had the best experience here! Saeed was so helpful while I was looking at the available cars. Ali made the transaction process so quick and easy, and made sure my dog had some fresh water and treats while we were there. I would definitely recommend anyone looking for a good car deal to check out American Motors! I'm so happy with my purchase, thank you!< /review>

<rating>1< /rating><review>They put coolant sealer/thickener in the coolant system in my Car to seal a Leak by the heater core.
Because of their brilliant quick fix to sell a car....
The inside of my whole coolant system looks like an egg (perhaps that’s what they used)

My Radiators are only working at 40% capacity and heater core is clogged along with my whole system
Please do not trust this sketchy place like I did.

(PLUS- They know the guys at the dealerships around  so don’t bother for a PPI like I did)

Thank you American Motors 🥰<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

<text>This place is really good for buying a used car. Despite what the building looks like, the cars are cleaned, maintained and well-taken care of; the purchasing process was very simple; and Amin answered all questions asked. The overall service was great! Everyone was courteous, we were offered complimentary drinks, and even given a tip for a good oil-changing place. Would definitely recommend.</text>< Pics>

< Review>
I bought a 2013 Kia Sportage from American Motors. The experience was good. I worked with Saeid and Ali. Mainly Saeid. He was professional, courteous, and honest. The car is good and deal is good. Their prices are really good. Look around online and so forth and you'll see American Motors is priced right. And, again, Saeid was professional and easy to work with. No hassles, no inaccuracies, no problems. And quick. I was in an out in about an hour (+/-). I recommend American Motors.< /Review>

Amin was great. They are so easy to work with.  The building looks...well...less than desirable...but the cars are all clean inside and so reasonably priced.

If you are looking at one of their cars don't hesitate to call and make an appointment or to purchase from them.  All the people I spoke with today were fantastic and the process was so easy.</text>

My car buying experience was great at American Motors. Ali was extremely helpful and the whole process couldn't have been easier. I found the car online and decided to come by to check it out. I usually stay away from smaller dealerships, but I'm glad I didn't this time.

The car was in amazing shape, the interior was spotless, the engine bay was so clean, and everything checked all the boxes I was looking for in a commuter car. I knew I wanted a diesel, and Ali informed me that with the huge diesel scandal, a lot of cars got recalled and have a 4 year 45k mile warranty. I looked this up, searched the VIN on Audi's website, and confirmed this was all correct.

There was never any pressure into buying a car, I never felt rushed, and Ali even held the car for me with a deposit because I was closing on my house and needed some time before returning.

All in all, great service and great little selection of cars.

I'll be sending my friends over if they see a car they like.< /review>

<Text>Ali and Amin were fantastic to work with, and I would highly recommend.  Fast and thorough response, they sent a video of the car I purchased since I live 2 hours away.   No surprises, and they took the trouble to have the car inspected and completed a costly repair before buying.    Pricing was very fair and don’t expect to negotiate much.  A pleasure working with these guys, they know their business.</Text>< Rate>

Ali was an absolute gentleman and talked me through the car in an honest and open way. Bought a Mazda 6 from him and am thrilled with the car. He allowed me to have the car inspected and explained parts of the contract that I didn’t understand. The car drives great and he gave me a very fair price. No bs.</review>

<text>One could assume that when you've been in constant communication w/someone and have asked about a vehicle, issues that would be so unavoidable when test driving such as an;

Air bag light
Squeeling pitch noise when turning wheels
Clunk clunk clunk noise when starting vehicle

Would have been brought up.

Luckily the time wasted wasn't by a huge margin. The fact that Ali had failed to mention this and seemed almost "meh" when I told him about these issues and had then"audacity" to ask if I was interested in any other vehicles. Unheard of to me, at least.
The principal here is character and honesty and if I have to question these two very important things, it's safe to say my instincts have already told me to leave.

Ali is a nice guy, he's got great communication when it comes to timing, poor communication when it comes to talking about issues.

$4900 plus state taxes and fees isn't cheap and hiding issues is never okay, you can get sued. Not to mention it's likely a danger for the buyer.<//text>< resp>

Came to this lot particularly to look at a Truck that we found on CarGuru.

Both Ali's were helpful and were able to work with us to take it home.
We did purchase a 3 year warranty for $2k that covers bumper to bumper ( including engine, transmission and more) .Just to be on the safe side o my because you never know what can go wrong with the vehicle in the future.</review>

Their sales rep is lying straight to my face telling me one of their vehicles is a higher trim and he's trying to charge way above Fair Market Price on Kelly Blue Book.
I look up the VIN number on MULTIPLE websites and the car is showing up as a BASE model on all of them. I SHOW the rep the search results and he still ARGUES with me that it's a higher trim!
Absolutely unreal!

I am very disappointed that I took a 20-mile trip to test drive an Audi A3 and I was told that I could only drive the car if I filled out a form to pre-qualify to buy before I could take it for a spin. I think it is fair to ask for it, but not a great customer experience. I left without the test drive and I won't be coming back any time soon.<//text>

Terrible customer service, encouraged credit check before disclosing important vehicle information (totaled vehicle, salvage title). I recommend making sure you look at the car fax before attempting to purchase from this car lot. Next time, disclose the proper information when a customer asks why your vechile is being sold at a discount.</review>

My daughter purchased her Hyundai Elantra from American Motors (mom went for the process). Ali and Ozzie were great!  Mindful if our time frame and found the best deal for us.  We even walked out with a new insurance company due to Ozzie's referral (cheaper then Allstate).  Best experience I have had purchasing a vehicle (and I purchased quite a few in my time).  I would highly recommend American Motors to anyone looking for a vehicle. I will defiantly tell family & friends of my experience!  Thanks!!</text>

The services at America Motors is very Professional and Knowledgeable. My fiancé and I bought a Nissan Versa yesterday and we are so satisfied with the great customer service they provided. We recently relocate to CA from KY and we do need a car to work here. After we had done some research and chose American Motors. And they truly provide a great customer service, professional support. Ali’s team helped my fiancé updated car insurance since he sold old car in KY and canceled the old one car insurance. Dropped us off at the bank to prepare checks. Ali and his team really deserve 5 stars for their excellent work on my car.<//Review>

Sales representatives don't leave their name when they call you for business. Also, they claim they cannot accept a down payment that falls under AT LEAST $1,200 (on a vehicle that is only priced at $7,000)- that's a scam.<//Text>

Please do not use this laundry mat. The machines are never in working condition. The machine stops and the starts over and over again. Your clothes won't be clean in the end. Then, there's no staff on site or number to contact anyone to help because of their broken machines. The best thing you can do is google barstow pd number so you call their non emergency number and they'll contact the people for you. Then the workers will try to blame you for the machines being broken. Just avoid this place at all costs. It will save you time and money.< /text>

This place used to be the cleanest in town sad when you are going to have to drive out of town to wash your blankets.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

Just want to let the  customer's know, hot water rarely works, ok if you don't need hot water. Cleaner now than it's been in the past
Has nice 5 loaders and fair prices.<//review>

Nice little hole in the wall establishment. Needs a little tlc. A great sweep and mop. Normal set up. Sml washers and large dryers.  Largest washer will fit a military duffle bag with room coast is 5.75 (as of 1.3.21). Seems to always be packed. Had to wait for washer and dryers. It is small.<//text>

STAY AWAY - This location and Barstow Management are one in the same - defective machines, no onsite personnel and no contact number for assistance makes for a horrible experience if anything goes wrong - as it did for me! Machine did not work properly and we were left paying another time for a working washing machine AFTER the first machine unlocked. Waste of time and money!</review>

<review>Customer service attitude was excellent. Understood that I wanted what I wanted. Didn't try to substitute what I didn't want for what they didn't have. Very personable, easy to talk to. Only thing missing is distance between parking and the flow of traffic. Not their fault, but something to keep in mind, when you pull out.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

I need a bat supply during a power outage and they were the only shop in miles to still have it in stock. Maps wasnt working correctly and i got lost and the gentleman working there guided me over the phone and even stayed open after hours to help me. Great shop lets support the neighborly service.< /text>

<Review>They did what they  said they were going to do, they provided prompt & courteous service, gave more than one follow up call, to notify me of their progress during repairs. The repairs were done in a timely manner as promised & I paid the price they quoted , there were no surprises or hidden charges. I definitely would use their  services again & would highly recommend them to others for all of your electronic needs. They even have a nice selection of fun toys like Remote Controlled trucks, cars & boats. They can be seen demonstrating them in their parking area. Large selection of used & new styles of power cords that most other stores don't carry. Offer older  & obsolete accessories for those of us that still love our old stuff or can't afford to upgrade every 6 mos. Reasonable prices, courteous & knowledgable service. 5 ☆☆☆☆☆< /Review>< Pics>

The guy on the floor took the time to teach me a thing or 5 about hooking up speakers, from portable audio goodies, through my 12v vehicle amp, into speakers. A $6.00 wireing harness, on the shelf, saved me some groveling !< /Review>

Best electronic store around. Danny the store owner does great at fixing computers. And he can build a computer with his eyes closed.  And inexpensive to purchase a computer from him. Da best around. If it wasn't for Danny people would be without computers to fix, because that jackass in Kelseyville screws up computers. That guy in Kelseyville messed up my friends computer. Take your computer to Danny at clearlake electronics.<//Text>

I've purchased items from this store in the past. This is an independently owned electronics hobbiest store. They have an assortment of electronic and mechanical parts that the typical hobbiest would be looking for.
Additionally, the fellows who work there are technically savvy and are willing to help you figure out what needs to be done, or you can hire them to teach you!
While I was there, a customer arranged for the technician to come to his house to unravel his complex home computer system. The agreed on price was only $40/hour!< /review>

Great service and outcome. One of the best things is that they do not overbook like some of the national chains do. When you arrive it is very comfortable and no rush to get you out the door. There is value in the quality and the outcome.< /Review>

<Text>First review ever after 15 years on Google -- that's how good she is. The price? Best you will ever see for this good of a haircut in the Bay area. One bloke to another: you'd be doing yourself a grand disservice for not giving her a try.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Review>i remember when i used to get haircuts from Annie when she used to work at sam's barber shop. She was always so friendly and welcoming and i'm glad that she opened up her own barber shop. Haircuts are amazing here for the price. i would highly recommend getting a haircut here!!!! <3<3<3<3< /Review></record>

<Review>Annie is very skilled and always cuts my hair just the way I like it. If I want a change, she's always happy to adjust the style.
Mostly walk-in, but I think if you're a regular, you can text or call ahead and she'll hold a spot for you.
I highly recommend her to anyone in the area. Very affordable and high quality haircuts!<//Review><Time>1550450141859<//Time><gmap_id>0x808f79b3baac6c3d:0x7b315321b1cba47d</gmap_id><Resp>None</Resp>< Pics>

Fantastic haircut, at a good price. Annie and her staff were amazing. I needed an emergency haircut before presenting the next day at Dreamforce. Landed at SFO, called and Annie was gracious enough to fit me in before having to get to a dinner appointment. Not only were they friendly and accommodating but I got the best haircut I’ve had in years. Wonderful service and the price was great. Thank you Annie and team!<//text>

<review>Annie is an experienced well-known hair stylist and am glad to see that she has now set up her own place. I've had consistently awesome haircuts from her... every single time! She's equally adept with scissors and clippers and does some fantastic fades. The rates are reasonable and she's an absolute pleasure to speak. I've seen fussy little kids love getting haircuts from her! If you stay in or around San Bruno, I'd highly recommend her for your hair dressing needs.< /review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Open sundays. Happy staff. In and out in 20 so I could catch my flight. $25. Great attention to detail! Couldn’t be happier. Thank you very much!< /review>

usually I get a $6 haircut at sf chinatown that's pretty good, but I don't mind paying $25 here to get a cleaner cut that's not rushed.< /Review>

Tasty eats and friendly, accommodating service. Great chips and salsa and filling entrees. "XXX" spicy hot sauce on request (awesome!).  Spacious indoor dining area but, for now, patio dining only (pandemic restrictions).  Relaxing and enjoyable. It doesn't seem very noticeable from the nearby main road but totally worth finding (just use Google Maps!).  Convenient location and easy parking.<//text>

<text>Ordered a combo with cheese enchilada, beef taco and beef and bean burrito. The menu didn't say the Beef and Bean Burrito would be smothered with cheese/sauce, not the best item to order and have to eat while driving and the beans were a bit bland. The taco was good though. Rating is based on menu description lacked info and the portability of the food.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8wp9ZkNccEY5YqpC__N89cZfv-9tbJm-Y7jRd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPEYa10wpdDzwYjir0Dqchhu54fnC2mbKVTa3JG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< response>

Very good food! I started with the thick, crisp chips and excellent salsa. My a la carte fish taco contained a generous portion of moist, perfectly grilled fish. Clista's said her "enough for two meals" beef taco plate was excellent.  Finished with a delicious flan for two. We're going back, soon!</text>

I had the albondigas soup, and that was nasty. It needed more salt, and i had to pour the regurgitated salsa that they had serve me before to make it somehow flavory. If you love your family or friends, do not come to this place. The salad and even the lemon slice on the side of my cup looked old and dry. Whoever said this is authentic mexican food, is tripping. Seek some help. Please.<//Text>

Cafe Rosarita has the best Mexican food around. Their cheese enchiladas are delicious. Their enchilada sauce is the best I've ever had. I have bought it on occasion when I make my own enchiladas. Chili relleno's are excellent and homemade. Their tamales are homemade and delicious. The restaurant is family owned and they are a great family.</Text>

Everything about our experience at Cafe Rosarita was perfect. The staff was friendly & the food was absolutely incredible. We got take out because of COVID19 and it was 10/10. We got a beef chimichanga plate and a chicken enchilada plate. Highly recommend!!!!!!!<//review>

<text>Absolutely the best Mexican food in all of San Diego and the world. SERIOUSLY!!!! From the moment you walked in you and immediately feel the family atmosphere the cleanliness of the establishment and you can smell the home cooking. Everything is fresh to order with the freshest ingredients I've ever had including the tortillas for the tacos and burritos.<//text><rate>5< /rate><userid>103468938219884016162<//userid>< Pics>

Awful food.  Not delicious, not fresh.  The people are very nice but the food is truly, truly terrible. This is some of the worst "food" I've had in years. It's not fit for a dog to eat . Definitely not Mexican food and I have to question even the term "food" because it was so bad. Had a carne asada burrito. The meat was charred to a crisp and the only thing you could taste was burnt and salt. I will never eat at this place again. All of us feel a little sick to our stomach after eating there.  Bllccchhhhh!< /text>

< Review>
Best Mexican food in Oceanside. This family owned restaurant offers the best service at reasonable prices.  We love our Saturday lunches at this place. The salsa and chips are to die for and I could eat their beans with every meal. Lunch specials are $5.00 and those prices are good on Saturday as well. I wish they were open on Sunday but oh well, families need a day off too!</Review>

<text>Cafe Rosarita is my #1 local Gringo Mexican food restaurant that has the Rosarito Mex joyous feel I only know from the late 80s into the 90s.  For me,  the Gringo surf trip people made that town fun back then.  And I feel lucky to find the Cafe Rosarito because it reminds me of them good days. The food is excellent and the atmosphere laid back, friendly and competent .  The steak special bargain is the most satisfying dish in town , or perhaps all north county SD.   Don't reveal the secret spot k38 we know.

The outside table allows your dog to be there while you eat ( note: the dog can't eat at the table - but  our dog sure loves the leftovers as soon as we're home and always complies with her best behavior )Thank you Cafe Rosarito !<//text><user_name>Thomas Cormack<//user_name>< rate>

<Rate>2< /Rate><review>Was recommended this place so we went for lunch. The service was pretty okay. They just happened to be swamped with 2 ladies working. The food was okay. The tacos had plain boiled chicken. I was expecting at least some seasonings, especially being authentic. Nothing really special with the beans and rice either. They do have pretty good childrens meals since my kids think Taco bell is mexican food and refuses to eat anything but. 😒<//review>< pics>

I ask to pay and the guy says,  oh no, you no like, you no pay.   We ate, we ordered more, we paid, happily.   Great food I talk about to this day.

<Review>I was in Oceanside visiting my family and they decided to take me to this place because of it's reviews. The owner was nasty, and over charged our bill by adding an extra plate of food, which we did not order. When I tried to explain to her what she did, she grabbed the bill out of my hand and stormed off. When she returned with the amended bill she just through it on the table, and walked off, not even so much as an "I'm sorry, nothing". Hell will freeze over before I ever go back into that establishment. If you do go look over your bill carefully don't just blindly pay it.< /Review>< user_name>

Both waitresses that served us were kind and loved our kids. We were a little undecided on what to eat because neither of us like a ton of food at restaurants but the waitresses accommodated our want to split a combo plate and dished up everything on separate plates. I am not a huge Mexican food lover like my wife but we both were very impressed with the food. Cafe Rosarita is a very unassuming restaurant so we were glad we enjoyed the food so much. All of the ingredients tasted fresh and were cooked perfectly. We will be visiting Cafe Rosarita each time we are in Oceanside and we will recommend it to our family who visits there often.< /review>< Pictures>

< review>
The only reason I am giving this place one star is because I can't give it a zero star, which is what it deserves. My daughter and I was in Oceanside visiting with my grandson who is a Sergent in the marines and he was deploying in 2 days. My grandson suggested we try this Mexican restaurant. I was on a very small budget so I had to keep my meals to a bare bones minimum. I ordered my food, and then I asked the woman if I could get a side of sour cream. She brings me this large bowl of sour cream, which at the time I thought was very generous of her until I got my bill. The woman charged me a whopping extra $4.00 for the sour cream, which caused my bill to go up to $18.00. I didn't ask for all that sour cream, I just asked for a side of sour cream thinking it would be an extra .50 or.75.
I told her I couldn't afford an extra $4.00 on my bill because, I was on a fixed income and I had to make $60.00, which was what I had left after buying meals for the first 2 days I was there, last me another 4 days until I got home. She was very nasty, and told me she was not removing it from my bill, and that if I couldn't afford to eat out then I shouldn't have come to her restaurant.
I have dealt with a lot of nasty people in my time but to be treated with such total disregard from a restaurant owner, and the nastiness in which she spoke to me unbelievable. I will never set foot back in that place, and I suggest you check your bill thoroughly before paying it.<//review>

Cafe Rosarita is pretty good /ok for a  quick (rather small) meal. They have $5.50 LUNCH "special" platter; choice of 1 of 3 ( either a beef taco or a chicken taco or a cheese enchilada, with each including beans/rice.
Every day they have 1 menu item on special pricing, which is an $ amount less than the regular price for that item on any other given day. The Interior; open space, lotsa tables /no booths, outdated(not modern), but very decorated. :) The guitar music is fantastic, Love it. Overall it's ok but for the prices of most plates, it's not a lot of food, I'm thin & I never take  any back home. It's cool to try a different plate each time. Chips & Salsa are good/ tastes fresh.< /review>

My favorite  restaurants. My choice, the chicken burritto with lots of red sauce, is delicious as are the  burritos a tacos. Their chips  are a fresh made, crunchy treat. Rosarita's is a weekly favorite.< /Review>

This place is decent. The chips & salsa was the first hint that they don't put much effort. Chips were stale & the salsa was watery and bland like unripe tomatoes. The bean & cheese burrito was average, hard to mess that up. Probably won't come back.<//review>

< Review>
I came in and there were about 5 customers in total and four employees. Given the small sizes of the orders before me, I don’t think I should have waited as long as I did - about 5 minutes. On average, my waba orders come in at about 2 minutes. Also, my plate was missing dressing and did not have the spicy waba sauce substitute as requested. I don’t normally leave reviews, but when things go as wrong as this, I feel it may be a learning lesson for management.< /Review>

<text>I went to the store on Canyon Springs and the cashier doesn't let you order she interrupts hence she doesn't listen. I ordered 2 chicken and steak bowls with onion and she gave me 2 steak bowls no chicken and no onion. The receipt says Brenda, she does not provide a positive customer experience. Apparently she does not like her job.</text>< pictures>

They also have vegetarian options available. It’s great that you can watch your food being made so you can see for yourself that you’re getting exactly what you ordered.

They have this small station near the cash registers where you can bag pickled carrots, jalapeños, chives, and lemons.

The bowl I have pictured is the chicken rice bowl. On Wednesday’s and Saturdays, you can get two of these bowls for around $11.</Text>< pictures>

Don’t think I would be ordering from this place again. I ordered online for pick up at 6:30. Came in, was told I had to wait...i waited about 15-20 mins and the people who ordered later in store/online got their food first. At that point I thought of just walking away or getting my money back. I understand they were busy but what’s the point of ordering online when you can’t even get your food on time?? It’s especially ridiculous that the people who ordered before me got their food first...i would give it zero stars if I could.< /text>

3rd time in a row I show up a few minutes past their open time and the front doors are still closed. Very annoying because I only have a certain amount of time for lunch. Maybe they need to update their business hours online more often.<//Review>

I eat at this spot at least twice every week.  The service is ALWAYS friendly, and the food is always prepared well.  They even manage to make it look good - all crammed into that bowl.  The restaurant sees a lot of traffic, and the staff does a very good job of keeping it clean.

Highly recommended!</Text>

Food quality and taste was 4 stars but what made it 3 stars is that they were out of supplies like chopsticks and sauce containers.  Service and speed were excellent.  Would love to give it 4 stars but for the price - $6 for a chicken bowl with brown rice and up to $9.75 for their salmon plate - the portions are modest.  Will come back though when nearby.< /Text>

Rude employees. They also don't follow health code. (Don't wash hands after handling money, they eat/drink in prep and cook areas ) I also found a hair in my food which pissed me off.  I love waba because I can get good food fast. Just not at this location<//Review>

I dont eat fast food, just irks me but Waba Grill is far from your typical fast food establishment. The food is always freshly prepared in front of you and the staff is always so awesome! Kuddos to this store<//Review>

<Rating>2</Rating><review>Employee at register who was handling money left the register then applied gloves and began cutting beef. She never washed her hands before applying gloves. The employees like to leave their personal drinks on the prep fridge in the front. You can not eat or drink in food prep locations.

Facility inventory was very low. 3 of the 5 thing I asked for they were out of. Employee said their delivery was late.

Beef veggie bowl did not taste as good as other WABA Grills. Very disappointed.

Customer service was okay.<//review>< Pics>

<Text>Went in to grab some dinner before work and when I approached the counter I waited a good 5 minutes before any of the workers/cashiers paid any attention to the fact that I was waiting to place my order, despite the fact that the 2 cashiers were just standing around pretending to be busy. At this time there were no other customers waiting to order. While waiting for my number to be called another worker was sloppily sweeping around customers who were eating , trash from floor hitting their (and my own) feet, no "excuse me" or "I'm sorry" was said. The same neglect was shown to a couple of other customers who walked in and were ignored by the cashiers. When I picked up my order and began to ask for the little containers for extra sauce, the cashier rudely cut me off and with an attitude told me there was extra sauce in my bad (little sauce packets) and basically shoved my food towards me.  Horrible, HORRIBLE customer service.<//Text>< response>

WaBa grill is typically a great place to eat...BUT NOT THIS LOCATION. My wife & I got sick once, thought it must have been a fluke. Went back a second time (stupid decision)...both of us missed work the next day! We aren't they type that call in sick, but WaBa Canyon Springs gave us food poisoning, absolutely NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. The place should be shut down! The employees seem careless, and it shows. NEVER EVER AGAIN! I'll stick to Flame Broiler.</Text>

<text>Its 8:46pm and i already ordered, received and ate my food from burger boss next door. Went to Waba to grab food for my pregnant girlfriend who was craving and tgey were closed at 8:28pm when they arent suppose to close til 9. So anyone whos dealt with a pregnant woman knows my situation. No thanks to the lazy workers who closed early and put their oversized headphones in so they didnt have to deal with anyone asking questions, I took my business elsewhere. Todays Saturday, January 14th and its only 8:48. Screw you Waba, you let me and my family down.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><UserId.>106206726579390003501< /UserId.><Resp>None</Resp><Rate>1< /Rate>< Date>

Terrible customer service experience. Food was okay compared to other waba. I ordered a half chicken half steak bowl, and a chicken bowl. Upon getting the order, there were the same portions of chicken in each bowl, but the other had steak. Portions way off. When I inquired about it, I received attitude, and was said this was the policy.

Very stingy waba gril, very diapointed.<//Review>

<Text>First time visit. Had the Special two chicken bowls. I asked for half and half  on the rice, they forgot. I did get my other rice. However, that was it, nothing else. No vegetables, just chicken and rice. The chicken was chopped but apparently the blade needs to be sharpened. Very sloppily done.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

Expensive for what it is. Meat is dry and flavorless. Not sure what the appeal is.< /text>

This place suffers from ghetto city inhabitant treatments. Sadly, they do not offer the sauce on tap any longer.</Review>

David Huffman and the fresh start legal team totally rocks!!! He personally handled my case from beginning to end including answering my phone calls and or called me back promptly.  He got my certificate of rehabilitation in pretty good time considering the pamdemic.. it went smoothly without a hitch.. I will TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS TEAM TO EVERYONE.  I rarely leave reviews but when I receive  exceptional service I have to let folks know !!! THANKS AGAIN DAVID!!!< /review>

I had sent a query to David Huffman at Fresh Start. He answered me quickly and by simply reviewing my circumstances, advised me into a situation that allowed me to buy my gun the following week. I was overlooking facts that he was able to advise me on as an attorney knowing the laws. Thanks to him, I have my gun for protection in such uncertain times. David and his concern for my issue are was truly spectacular!! Cannot recommend enough!  A personal touch you won't find elsewhere, for sure.< /text>

It was an excellent service. The only one that offered a guarentee and the lowest price, I checked many others. They walked me through step by step , and were very easy to contact for any questions. They have a cool status page of your case that gets updated every new step of the process. Very neat and tidy process .<//text>

Fresh start law center and mr Huffman were able to help me do something I didn't think was possible. They got me a fresh start! Yes, corny I know but that is the easiest way for me to describe it. Seriously,  fill out their online questionnaire or call them directly. If you decide to give them the opportunity to help you I don't think you will be disappointed. They responded back very quickly and answered every question I had.<//review>

This was my first time ever having to go through the expungement process, and I must say I am extremely pleased with the experience.  I saw alot of reviews on this company and alot of the complaints I saw were of people complaining of the documentation they had to provide. I feel you get what you put in and this company is here to help you as much as you let it. That being said, before I even called I had a copy of my disposition ready to go. I took the eligibility test, sent an email and got a response within hours. I personally talked to Mr. Huffman, got a list of things I needed to get ready and got to work.  Even living in Texas, the process went by smooth and quick.  Mr. Huffman required a few documents I already had ready prior and I was able to get letters of recommendation immediately.  Again, some of the complaints I saw were of people expecting this company to do ALL the work completely for them, which I thought was a bit absurd, especially living in these times we're in full of restrictions and delays. My start date was 03 DEC 2020 and I got my record Expunged with paper work in by 05 APR 2021. Not bad for being 3 states over and not once having to go back to California for any reason.  Mr. Huffman kept me updated with both emails and their tracking system online.  If you are going to go with this company, just remember, YOU are hiring them, and they are only as effective as you let them be. So have all your ducks in a row and be ready to help with some paperwork in order to receive the fastest response times available. Thank You Mr. Huffman for everything, I can now push forward with my career.</review>

<review>A positive experience in every way...It is such a pleasure to share my experience with this professional firm. I highly recommend Fresh Start Law Center as they exceeded all of my expectations. Upon my research, the wonderful reviews that this Law Center has already deservedly received, made my informed decision simple to clearly choose this Firm to handle my legal needs as I too can voice how my experience was also a positive one in every way. I appreciate their very informative website that honestly represents what to expect. I also appreciated how efficient the entire process was with such excellent communication. The consistently updated site to check our personal account in case there were any updates put our mind at ease with such care. The respectful communication meant so much to me. Upon receiving such professional assistance, the cost was absolutely reasonable and I would not hesitate to recommend this invaluable help to loved ones when needed as I proudly give my review. Mr. Huffman is a gentleman that embodies the meaning of integrity. His work ethic is why his excellent reviews are well deserved. He earned our trust, admiration, and gratitude. Thank you again for helping our family in ensuring that our future has a tremendous foundation as doors open to better opportunities thanks to Mr. Huffman and Fresh Start Law Center. We are indescribably grateful and wish you all the best.< /review>< pics>

I would first like to say that they did exactly what I hired them to do. They got my felony reduced and expunged. And they do respond semi immediately.

The founding lawyer was who I worked with and did not feel respected. He was a little rude, and didn’t act like he cared about me. When talking on the phone he came off as though he was talking to a friend not a client. I asked him for advice a few times on how to word things or to get information and just came off as if I was bothering him.

With that being said I give this firm a 3 star rating. The lack of compassion really played a major role on my decision to write this review.

Lastly I want to say I am not writing this to hurt the firm. This is just my personal opinion based on my first hand experience with them. I will end by saying that if needed I would hire him again.< /Text>

Strongly recommend hiring them. They did what they promised and in a timely manner. He kept me updated and responded to all concerns quickly. I just had to email all my documents and he took care of the rest. Thanks to David and his team I am able to return to school and start my career!</Text>

<review>Amazing experience. Mr Huffman and his team practiced excellent communication (significantly better than my previous experience with law firms and on par with other customer focused industry leaders), set clear expectations, obtained favorable results and conducted follow through that I did not expect. All at a very reasonable price.
From initial contact, I found their systems very easy to use. I loved being able to check on the status of my order at my convenience. I had to call their office two times (one for initial consult) and found their staff to be professional, courteous, understanding and knowledgeable.
Overall, I highly recommend Fresh Start Legal!< /review>< Pics>

all work, dedication and time has its reward.  for me it was a pleasure that david took my case.  It was very fast, I did not expect it even in this quarantine.  David always kept me up to date on my case.  Thanks to a good man named Brian Keleman it is how I was able to contact David to work on my expungment.  He recommended it to me.  his work was great.  I did not have the pleasure of meeting the lawyer David huffman in person, but I am grateful to him and may God continue to give him more wisdom and work to help people.<//review>

Mr. David and his firm are absolutely AMAZING!! I signed up thinking this would be a long, drawn out and painful process. I just knew that I was in for a fight. Yet, Mr. David took care of every right feom the beginning. The hardest part was getting my paperwork to his office. I thought I would spend years trying to gain my rights back. SMH NOPE. Mr. David did everything need so that once my case was over, all of my rights had been restored!! I am THRILLED with the service of this firm!!</review>

<Text>The next day after I contacted  fresh start law center  David Huffman the owner of the law firm contacted me directly I was shocked how quickly he responded to me. Answered all my questions regarding my felony conviction and sent me over  all the necessary documents and questionnaires needed for my case to be expunged. His costs were very inexpensive with no hidden fees  compared to other law firm's Quotes. Approximately three months later he contacted me and told me my case expungement had been granted.  No more felony conviction . Great news on so many levels. David was very professional ,punctual   And I was able to contact him directly and he actually answered my calls. I would highly recommend him for any cases you might have. Thank you David for all your hard work I truly appreciate you.

I would definitely recommend Fresh Start Law Center.  I was skeptical at first that I could have my conviction expunged but to my surprise David was successful.  The whole process was very easy too.  I just had to e-mail him some paperwork and that was it.  Plus, the price advertised is the exact price I paid, not a penny more.  Try Fresh Start Law Center, it's a great service and you'll be satisfied.< /review>

David personally spoke to me and reassured me the matter could be resolved. He immediately delivered on his promise! I couldn't be more happy! I had a couple inquiries during the process, and Fresh Start answered within minutes. It is rare to find a firm this professional. Uf you are considering expungement, don't wait.

David was immediately available and helpful via phone and email from my first inquiry. He documented all the necessary bureaucratic moves I had to make in order to work with him and his team to get my record cleared. He also advised me during the entire process and ensured I had a good case for the expungements. After he did all the court filings for my cases, he informed me of the time for court turnaround and of course we achieved the expungements within this timeline. He is timely, professional, available, and to top it off the cost was very reasonable for handling everything. I highly recommend him and I can't imagine any scenarios in which you would not achieve your goals with David and his firm. Their website is also very helpful and informative which is why I initially wanted to work with them.<//Text>

<Review>I wanna thank mr Huffman for removing the cloud that hung over my head for years , I feel reborn with a fresh start , I moved from the town that my conviction s took place and it would have been a huge Challenge to try and do this process myself, I didn’t have to attend any hearings and the Communication was superb they make you feel like you matter and there prices are very affordable, I should have done this years ago , once again thank you mr Huffman<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

< review>
The next day after I contacted  fresh start law center  David Huffman the owner of the law firm contacted me directly I was shocked how quickly he responded to me. Answered all my questions regarding my felony conviction and sent me over  all the necessary documents and questionnaires needed for my case to be expunged. His costs were very inexpensive with no hidden fees  compared to other law firm's Quotes. Approximately three months later he contacted me and told me my case expungement had been granted.  No more felony conviction . Great news on so many levels. David was very professional ,punctual   And I was able to contact him directly and he actually answered my calls. I would highly recommend him for any cases you might have. Thank you David for all your hard work I truly appreciate you.

Sincerely James Lyman</review>

This place is small space-wise, menu-wise, and TV wise. I'm kind of confused about what they're going for.

The space isn't that big a deal. The menu only offers 4 burgers, and 2 kinds of fries. They do offer blackbean burgers as option. The kitchen staff is quick and the food we did get was delicious.

More disappointing is that their beer selection is tiny! There is only 4 beers on tap, but each beer well selected. They have a similarly small wine selection. And a decent liquor selection.

There were a good number of people  watching the Stanley Cup hockey game, but the TVs were small. The space had some interesting atmosphere, but a lot of blank dark painted walls too.

So honestly, I don't know what this place is going for and I'm not sure they know either. I enjoyed my burger, fries, and beer but I feel like I've seen everything this place has to offer after one visit. Maybe I'd go back if it were cheaper but they charge brewery prices for to little in my opinion. Its worth a try if you've never been

Edit: A lot of people are saying this place has the best burger in town. Not even close. Burgers are 7/10 at best. The bar in SD is high<//text>

I can see why this place has been in business for decades, the burgers are amazing and probably have to be in the top 3 in San Diego I've had thus far. This place is a dive bar with decor from yesteryear and you can easily drive past without ever knowing it was there. I believe I've had the best barbecue bacon cheeseburger of my life here. The bun's a crazy soft and the bbq sauce and burger had great flavor. I've also had the taco/burger which was also great. If you're looking for a solid burger, go here.<//Text>

One of the best burgers in SD! They really can make you a real juicy no frills burger. Limited beer options, wish they carry more craft beers. Place is dark, plenty of street parking. Happy hour burger and beers are $5!< /Review>

This is a must try in San Diego! The portion size is average which is great if you are trying to fill your burger needs. I ordered a Balboa Burger and the California Burgito . The Balboa has a great taste, the beef is very juicy and high quality. The tomatoes and lettuce are very crisp, topped of with soft buns and fresh aioili house sauce. The Kennebec fries are great since they have little bit of spice. It was a very original take on burgers and it exceeded my expectations. The location its self is a hole in the wall but it definitely shines when being introduced to the traditional bar decor. Kevin the person helping us out was very professional and on top of it. I would recommend to come early on the weekdays because I could totally see this place being very popular on the weekends. Overall I would highly recommend The Balboa... Pro tip everyday from 4-6pm The Balboa burger is $5. What a steal. Hope they keep this promotion.</text>

Cozy, off the beaten path, hole in the wall bar. Best burger I've had in a decade hands down. Very limited seating. Only negative is there didn't seem to be an unlimited refill option for sodas.<//Review>

< Review>
You walk in and receive immediate greetings, great service, and amazing food. I ordered the Balboa burger and garlic fries; everything from the perfect toast to the bun, the flavor of the burger and the perfect garlic fries was on point. The drinks were made perfectly also. Very impressed with this location, being from out of town I will definitely return.<//Review>

<text>Best burger in town. It's the bun, it's the meat, it's the seasoning on the meat, it's the sauce.  All are good on their own, but when married, they create a complex flavor profile that makes you want more.  I've ordered a second burger bc I just didn't want that flavor to end. Prices and staff are awesome</text>< Pics>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Hole in the wall dive bar with one heck of a good burger!
Heard about this place from many friends who believe The Balboa has one of, if not the, best burgers in San Diego.
After trying many other spots (Hodads, Rocky's, The Friendly, etc.), I can truly say that they do indeed make my Top 10 list. Only reason they didn't make the Top 5 was that I don't put anyone in the Top 5 unless I've tried their burger multiple times.
The burger is flat-top grill cooked, served on a soft fresh traditional bun with lettuce, tomato, onions, cheese and their secret zesty aioli sauce.
DON'T expect a super clean restaurant style  place, this is a transitional dive bar and keeps it real.</text>< pictures>

For a counter service restaurant, The Balboa are pretty good. I'd compare the flavor of the meat to that you'd find at a sit down restaurants-- was flavorful and the burger was buttery.< /text>

Get the Balboa burger and the fries. The burger was cooked perfectly, the fries were crispy and seasoned very well, and the beer was ice cold. Great service and a friendly atmosphere. Just a short drive from the airport and not too expensive. Definitely check them out.</review>

<Text>Rating on the lunch. Burgers were absolutely delicious! We had been told they were great, so we got our hopes up. And they did not disappoint!! Advertised as never from frozen burgers, and lots of combinations! We all wanted no buns, no fries, low carb no problem,  on a beautiful bed of lettuce!  I got a fried egg on top with avocado! Super yummy! Hidden little gem of a place to eat, not just get a good drink!< /Text>< pictures>

<review>Small-ish place but they make do with the space they have. Order at the bar, take a number, and shortly thereafter, a delicious burger appears at your table. I had the Balboa with fries and it was quite tasty. Iced tea came out of the bartender’s nozzle but surprisingly not that bad. Service is fast and friendly. There are no windows but kind of makes it a dive bar with the dark atmosphere. Music playing was nice and they had a variety of different shows on the TVs. Extra points for napkins and condiments already at the table. $10 for the burger and fries (lunch special). And don’t forget happy hour where the Balboa burger is $5 and drinks are $1 off. Sadly, I don’t know how much longer they’ll be around as the building was sold and eventually they’ll need to move or close. Until then, enjoy the food, atmosphere and service.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6bZaGkYCMIueXP-im8ICwkDiARCFVMGwHfiwr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Response>

<Review>This place was fun to visit! Staff was awesome! Very helpful! PSA: if you're going here for Fireball, don't. They don't believe in it. Haha but they will make you a delicious custom shot instead! Black bean burgers aren't my favorite. A little flavorless. But the fries & drinks are great!<//Review></record>

Walking in it feels like your old dark dive bar with the huge exception that everything is nice. The burger was amazing and was not the kind of burger you’d expect at a dark bar, by far one of the better burgers I’ve had in a long time.< /review>

You know how you know you've had an amazing burger? It's all you talk about the entire time you're there! Got lucky on the happy hour pricing (it's every day!) & had our new fav burger in town - the Balboa. Can't wait to come back and try the chicken sandwich / pastrami. The vibe reminded me of the Midwest a little! Fun people & great atmosphere. Highly recommend!</Text>

Can't complain, it's exactly what youd expect. Pretty small, chill vibe, playing Turner and hooch and the office on the TVs, beats sports.
Food was as others have mentioned, surprisingly great, and the service was friendly and amenable.
check it out if you're on that end of the park, it's a quick walk.<//text>

Good place to have a beer and a burger with fries. Reasonable priced food and a variety of beers and Cocktails. We had a nice time in the late evening after we were close to starve in the balboa park. Bartenders were gentle and free ice w was also available.
As a downside i have to say that the "Cucumber smasher" was unexpected tiny.<//Review>

The Balboa has one of the best burgers in town. During Happy Hour, the namesake burger is only $5, they have a great tap list, make great cocktails, and I really enjoy the delightfully standoffish bar staff. They will not put up with your guff, but why should they? The Balboa is a wonderfully guff-free zone.</Text>

There was only one server when we got there, and he was very polite and gave us waters upon request. We took our time ordering from the menu, starting with some beers then getting into the food. ..insanely good.</Review>

I'm not sure why our burgers were so bad because we chose this place because of all the positive reviews on Google and Yelp.  My vegetarian patty was horrible and the entire burger was soggy and tasteless.  The same was the case for my boyfriend’s regular meat burger.  Maybe it's due to the pandemic that they stopped caring about the quality of their food but it was a total waste of money and time.< /review>

Food was good, but the person who took our orders was rather cold and acted like it was a burden to accommodate our group. This isn't the first time I heard about this type of behavior. My sister said the exact same thing when she and her friends went to this spot and our treatment last night confirms it. Don't work at a restaurant if it's a chore to serve people who are supporting your paycheck.<//Text>

What an amazing spot! I am not surprised that its a local favorite. I did not try any other burger joints in SD, but this is by far the best burger I have had. Although I have to be honest I haven't had many.

The place is in a very quiet neighborhood, it was very close to our airbnb. It doesn't look like much from the outside but its what inside that matters - burgers!!! We went on a Monday night and there where still people there. Its quite dimly lit, have about 5-6 tables and bar seating.

Now about the food. The burgers are amazing!! Me and my husband both had their balboa burger and it was just perfect! The patty was dripping! I was using the wrap they give with the burger and still ended up with juices on my hands. The bun is perfectly toasted and adds a charred flavor to the burger. The toppings are simple some onions, tomatoes and their sauce which is bomb! We both inhaled our burgers. The drinks were really nice too. I got their cucumber punch and it was really refreshing, nice break from the meaty burger. We got garlic fries on the side and these were one of the most well seasoned fries I have had in a restaurant. So good!! Service was quick and easy.

Would highly recommend to all meat-lovers. Also tip: you can get an extra patty if you are extra hungry.</Text>

Came here with my girlfriend and we LOVED it. We had the Balboa burger and the Pastrami burger with a side of garlic fries. Both items were cooked perfectly to order and the fries were so delicious. We ordered a few drinks and were blown away by the incredible bartenders! Personable and professional. There is plenty of seating and the music is amazing! I definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves a good strong drink and some amazing food!< /review>

Really good burger. Nice crunch on the outside and perfectly made medium rare on the inside. I wish the garlic was infused into the fries more, but the fries were well cooked. Margarita drink was ok. I tried my boyfriend's pastrami burger...WOW! I'm ordering that next time. So juicy and great quality. The bun was nice and soft and toasty.< /Review>

The burger is great.
The way you order it and the seating situation is not.

Hence why I never go.
The burger isn't good enough to weight out the cons.<//review>

FIRST this place is the best for its amazing burgers. I had a Classic with a fried egg on it and, let me tell you, it was the frikkin bomb. SECOND the people who work here are amazing. They are nice, smart, and have a knack for making good food at fair prices. This is a hidden jem on a one way street that is worth finding. Seriously.<//text>

<Text>Balboa Bar & Grill is a dive bar that serves the best burgers in San Diego, bar none. Everything about Balboa Bar & Grill's's burgers, including the beef mixture ratio, the secret garlic aioli recipe, and even their brand of mustard, has been purposefully and uniquely chosen to deliver a transcendent and congruent burger experience where the whole is much greater than the mere sum of its parts, but the most impressive unique feature are their buns, which are freshly-baked bolillo rolls shaped like hamburger buns. Some San Diegans may recognize bolillo as the same French-lilke Mexican bread used to make molettes and tortas in households and restaurants around the region.

And, yes, the other reviews you'll read about the delicious garlic fries are on point -- but I usually find myself ordering the regular fries made of the same Kennebec potatoes which are just as nice and crispy, but allow me to actually open my mouth around other people later in the evening without melting their faces.

In short, this is THE place to get burgers in San Diego.</Text><rate>5</rate><Name>Jay Keyes< /Name>< pictures>

Tasty burger, decent beer, I like the chairs and they play movies or sports.

Big table in the back to hang out with lots of folks.
It's not too far from Balboa Park so it great after visiting a museum.<//Review>

This place is awesome!  Small, dark little bar/grill, nice jukebox on the wall.  The people that work here are really nice and the burgers are as good as they come in San Diego, I'm not kidding!  The garlic fries are great too but don't plan on kissing any vampires after eating them, they don't play around with the garlic.</Review>

<Review>I've read several places that this place has one of the best if not the best burgers in San Diego. I had to try it for myself. Can't say I was disappointed. First of all the bar itself is pretty small with just a few tables so I can see how it would be challenging to eat here at a popular time. Rather dark inside but who cares. Let's talk about the burgers. I went during happy hour so balboa burgers were only $5. Burger was tasty, jucy and high quality. My only complaint is i wish it was bigger. Not that they were small i just wish I could keep on eating. 😉< /Review>< date>

My family and I were on vacation looking for somewhere to eat. We thought that this was a good burger place but it ended up being like a strip club or something...yeah not family friendly.< /text>

<Review>Great burgers and fries but this place greatly lacks customer service skills. My husband and I wanted to grab a burger before seeing a play at 7. We had about 45 min but with the play being at Balboa Park we had to make this a quick stop. We called to see if we could place our food ahead of time and they said no. So we put a take out order in. Then we got their and my husband ordered a beer so we sat at a table. There was another empty table and within 10 minutes of being there another table had emptied. When I tried to eat our food - take you I’m also 7 months prego, the bartender came to me and said we couldn’t eat our food there because people might show up and want to eat dine in...which I would totally understand if there was a line out the door but there wasn’t. It would have taken us 15 minutes to eat our food, considering we had to be out pretty quickly, but no they had to scold us and make snarky Cheerio remarks as we left. We will not be back. We have been loyal customers for 2 years but hell, they could have handled that situation way better.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

The Balboa: “Happy hour doesn’t apply to take out orders.”

Me: “Ok, I guess we can just eat here then.” Halfway through giving our order he stops listening and walks away. He comes back:

The Balboa: “There’s no available sitting so I can’t take your order until there’s open sitting.”

Me: “Well since there’s no sitting available can’t we just order to go at happy hour rates?

The Balboa: “Happy hour is only for sit in orders.”

Me: “Ok we’ll that’s annoying, let’s go find somewhere else to eat.”

Definitely never coming here again out of principle. Get some common sense maybe?<//text></record>

This place was recommended to us by a local and well worth the trip. The burgers are amazing. The fries were okay so not really worth it unless you're hungry. Staff was awesome, very friendly and welcoming. Definitely recommend.< /text>

<review>Awesome atmosphere. Really cozy. Everyone raves about rocky's burger (if you don't know what that is I highly recommend it.) but this burger literally stole the thunder. How basic the burger was it had so much flavor to it. It's gonna be my go to burger now. Plus it's 5 bucks during happy hour 4-6pm. Cheers.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Are people delusional? If you’re looking for a mediocre burger and styrofoam fries that are doused in seasoned salt here’s your place. Honestly, you are better off sticking to McDonald’s.< /Text>

In San Diego there are only two real Burger Joints and they both happen to be Bar’s. It’s either the Balboa or it’s a Rocky Burger. It’s still a debate which one is the best. It’s even hard for me to decide. My favorite burger at the Balboa is the  pastrami burger w/ the garlic fries and a cold dark beer. My wife is a purest and loves the Balboa Burger. When I asked which Burger place she liked best she couldn’t answer. Guess you will just have to try both.< /Text>

<review>Great staff, cost venue less to a great meal.  The food was chilled on point even fit my rare pastrami burger. Most people still coo it medium when I ask dl for rare, but they did it right here.  I was very impressed that the toasted bun held up too. Usually burger buns break it the weight and juices of burgers this large. I also enjoyed all the minced had on the garlic all fries.

Staff are friendly and taught me a bit about the local scene too</review>< pictures>

If you're with a friend/date, split a burger and get a basket of fries to share. Perfect amount of food to feel full, without feeling like you need to roll yourself out of there. Cannot say enough good things about the California Burg-ito!</Text>

Always an awesome burger. Although I recommend not going there on your lunch break unless you have a lot of time. It gets pretty busy then. Otherwise, well worth the wait.< /Review>

My friend said his pastrami burger was the best burger he's had in a while. I had the Balboa burger and I have to agree, it was delicious.
Lots of local craft beers on tap, and nice chill crowd at lunch time on a Friday.< /Review>

<text>This little place is easy to miss but hard to forget. One of the best burgers I've had in my life which is really something considering how cheap it was. The menu is small but made with fresh ingredients. We had the luck of taking to the owner and he was a great guy as well but really showed some exemplary character handling an exceedingly rude guest with professionalism and kindness. We hope to come back again some day.< /text><rating>5<//rating></record>

<review>Wow!!! This is the best place in San Diego to have a burger, the staff is friendly and the bar/ restaurant is cozy, the bartenders are masters of their craft and can make pretty much everything, the can recommend what brand of liquor is best for you drink and what would taste the best with your burger. The Balboa also have salads and sandwiches that I can't wait to try, the menus is short and sweet so you don't have to think so hard on what you want, can't wait for my next trip and try something new.</review>< pics>

Kick ass music, quick service and great, chill staff. Hubs had the pastrami sandwich and I had the bbq burger. Both were delicious and not too greasy. It didn't leave a greasy feeling on you. Everything including tip and drinks added up to just 25 bucks. We put only 75 cents in the meter, thinking we would probably need more change, but we were in and out of there in 35 minutes.<//text>

Literally, a whole in the wall kind of place. Loved the burger and the fries. Went on a Friday afternoon and some street parking were available. Their food's great and has a pub vibe. 4 stars because it's a tiny place, with only a few tables.< /text>

<time>1447727524705</time><rate>5</rate><text>Burgers are a very important thing to me and great ones can be difficult to find in fat phobic Southern California.  The Balboa has taken the burger to a zen level of mastery, great quality beef cooked on a nice heavy grill, hot enough to make that wonderful, but elusive, crust on the outside without destroying the inside.  The buns are fresh, custom made and delicious.  Overall I believe these are the BEST BURGERS in San Diego.  The garlic fries were a little intense for my taste buds but they are unique and I recommend giving them a try.

A nice selection of beers and a few other menu items round out the overall excellent experience.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Text>The burgers here are so legit, that I kindly ask you never to come here. Their menu is no frills and all deliciousness. It's a small place and as such, it is sometimes hard to find a table. They have a small but decent selection of usually local beers on tap as well as a legit cocktail cocktail menu. The guys behind the bar (and especially behind the grill) are amazing hosts to this upstanding establishment. Again, please do not come here and contribute to filling up one of the best bars in San Diego. Thank you!!!< /Text>< response>

Pound for pound, my favorite sub - $10 burger in San Diego.  They have great buns!  Small concise menu.  Great atmosphere. Gritty without being dingy.  This is one of my favorite spots in San Diego.< /Review>

I was told this was the best burger in town and it did not disappoint. My friend and I got there right when it opened at 11a and we were all done about 20 mins later. Definitely worth a shot. I went with the Balboa burger and fries.<//Text>

If you want a place to kick back after work to eat a burger and have a couple drinks, look no further! Balboa Bar and Grill has one of the best burgers in San Diego and at a great price, especially during happy hour. The beer selection is bit limited, but the row of liquor bottles will have something for every taste.<//text>

<Text>I am not very familiar with downtown San Diego. From the surface and not knowing any better, this doesn't seem like a part of town you want to hang around, especially once the sun goes down. The Balboa is small. There is a bar with probably a dozen-ish stools and then maybe 8 dinning tables. I could be off by 1 or 2 in my count. Anyways, the service was great and the bartender was very friendly. The Balboa Burger was excellent, I highly recommend and I would happily eat it again. The Garlic Fries, not so much. They weren't terrible but they weren't good. I guess I would use the word eatable to describe them. The place is very dark. When you enter during daylight, you will need a few minutes for your eyes to adjust so you can see. I felt like the pricing was very fair for what I received. No table side service, you need to order at the bar counter. This is not really a family place. So maybe leave the kids home. I would go back and I would recommend.< /Text>< pics>

Small bar with black walls that seems dark even in the middle of the day, but holy cow do they make delicious burgers there!  All the burgers there are great and even better with a side of garlic fries.  But be warned, there's not just a smidgen of garlic in these fries.  There's so much garlic in them that you'll be oozing garlic from every pour in your body for the rest of the day! But jeez its totally worth it, sooo good.<//Text>

This place has really good burgers! I got the balboa burger with an over medium egg. To drink I got the cucumber smash martini. Also it's a cool place for concerts. I saw Saba and Evan Bethany. They're kind of the same band. They have the same singers its just the lead singer in Evan Bethany is Evan Bethany and the lead singer in Saba is Saba.< /review>

Sure I'm a fan of Rocky's and Hodad's serve a decent burger too, but the burger at The Balboa (the old Tin Can) that is most likely the better burger of them all. Not a big fan of the garlic fries, but get the Centennial burger  and rest happy</text>

<Review>This is my favorite burger in the country and I'm a speaker of the best burger. Please come here and try the centennial, it will blow your mind. Make sure you get or medium.

<Text>One of my favorite burgers in San Diego, if not my #1 favorite. Love all that garlic aioli they put on their classic Balboa Burger. The place looks like a dive bar and has a very small menu. A couple different burger options, the best one is the classic Balboa. They also have one of the best garlic Parmesan fries I've ever had, with little chucks of crisped garlic. This place is a garlic lovers dream! Very good price for burger and fries. Will be coming back for sure!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<rating>5</rating><review>Not only are the assorted arrays of "meat" burgers out of this world but my favorite, the"vegie" black bean burger, is absolutely to die for!  Positively the BEST BURGER and sides I have discovered in Southern California.  Doods Foods is well worth a detour to sample some straight-forward comfort food in a totally chill atmosphere.  Check it out...you'll be glad you did.

You're welcome (in advance).</review>< Pictures>

This place is great, I'm not an old timer but man they play some classic badass music. Zeppelin to Collins. Burgers are sexy good. And douchebags (trump supporters) always seem to be kicked out. Which is good.</review>

This place is as dive bar as a place can be. I have read other reviews saying how the service is great, so maybe I didn't come on a good night? Because the guy who helped us was not too friendly. Anyway, tried to the Burgito since there is fries in the burger. It was pretty freaking good. Also got their garlic fries on the side.  Also very good!< /review>

For San Diego the tap list is sparse but always thoughtfully selected. Great neighborhood bar that has a very genuine feel to it. The burgers are ridiculous! (mic drop)</review>

Downtown dive bar, but I like it.  I will hit this place after work and get a $5 burger and a pint for under $10.  Try the hand made chips or the garlic fries, both worth a shot.<//Review>

Quite possibly the BEST BURGER in San Diego. Yes, better than Hodads.

Must add the egg and bacon! The fries are equally as delicious.<//review>

< Review>
Pretty good burger!  Not my top favorite in town but, pretty close!  Very fresh tasting, great bun, awesome garlic aioli!  Extremely good and very worth it! Garlic fries were delish and it reminded me of an old dive bar from back home.  Darker inside and very relaxing.  The bartender was extremely friendly and I really enjoyed the service.  We will be back.< /Review>

I liked it and will go back, but know what you're going for.  Burgers are $5 during happy hour, it's a neighborhood bar, good feel, there's not 20 beers on tap, but a good bartender and friendly crowd.<//Text>

Don't be fooled by the outside, this place is definitely a diamond in the rough. Friendly service, easy street parking, great cocktails, and arguably the best burger in San Diego.</Review>

Places like this restore your faith in humanity: dark, hole-in-the-wall atmosphere, rock-n-roll on the stereo, great burgers cooked to perfection, a small but absolutely solid selection of beer, and real cocktails made with an actual helping of booze--not some corporate spudder from a nozzle pre-measured to exactly one ounce.

The staff are great, the owner is cool, and it has the feel of a local pub rather than a joint catering to tourists--if my husband and I were local we would be in this place every day. As it is, we will be dropping in whenever we have a hankering for San Diego's fine martime air.< /review>

Yum! What a great hole in the wall full of delicious! GREAT Happy Hour specials every day, and the staff is super friendly and nice. The burgers were delicious and love the chipotle mayo. Don't forget to try to garlic fries. It will make you smell like garlic but they were so good. Cooked garlic so it was a little carmelized but still burned with rich flavor.

Cute atmosphere too!</review>

EDIT: It is now called the Balboa, I guess they wanted to kill everything that was unique and interesting about the Tin Can? Decor is slightly more lifeless and they dont do my favorite egg sandwich anymore, and the beer selection is worse now.
--------;
Man I love this place. It's a bit of a walk from my office, but when I'm in the mood for something special I always choose the doods. Guys are chill as hell, always good music playing, food is fast and greasy and amazing. Especially those fries and chips. Great beer selection too, never let anyone tell you a can is any different from a bottle or tap.< /Review>

I typically do not have energy for negativity but this place really did it. It was date night last Friday. I came in after a long day to enjoy a delicious burger. I came in thinking my night was going to be enjoyable but the workers made sure I did not have a good evening. We walked in and saw a small spot where we can eat. I said Hello then began to order food. The worker rudely interrupted my order and asked to see ID. Okay we showed him our ID's. Then he said there is no room to sit. I had to show him that there was seats. He then proceeded and took our order. Once we sat down there was a worker who brought us the burgers and then when I asked him for a water he refused and said I need to go to the bar to get a water. I got in line again at the bar waited several minutes before being helped while my food is getting cold. Then I order my water. The bartender went to pour my water then someone interrupted him and asked for water he gave them my water instead. leaving me to wait once again. They did not say anything nice. no greetings no anything. They seem to really hate it there. Not sure why. But they need to treat the customers with some courtesy and respect. They work with people. Either hire a more lively group of workers or train them. This is not okay. I am an organizer for the San Diego community and I will not refer any friends or bring groups of people here to support this business. Do not come here.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80d954a537cf6609:0x7ce3aab649fad79e< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

BEST burger in town.  I've had burgers from Slaters 50/50, Smash, Rockys in P.B.  The Balboa Bar abbr Grill burgers are THE BEST in San Diego, don't take my word for it,  check them out yourself!  They also have Craft Beers from several local Brewerys!</Text>

So I've been to Tin Can Ale House a handful of times as a performer and spectator and never had the 'pleasure' of having a Dood Food burger. Well, last night I was starving and was going to see a show there so I figured I'd break my Dood Food celibacy and take the plunge. The place was PACKED, so it took a while for my order to be ready. I'd say 'bout a half hour or so.

I ordered the BBQ Burger and garlic fries. Awe man! That burger made me wanna slap my momma and my grandma (God bless her soul). That tasty meat puck was did a tango on my taste buds and had me beggin for mercy. The juicy patty was dropping sauce and grease like it was hot...and it was hot. Fresh. Soft bun. Sauteed onions. It was THAT good, but not THE best. The garlic fries had fresh minced garlic...none of that powdery business. Tasty.

Overall, this experience was good. I'm ready to go back and have another variety and see if the legend lives on.</Text>

Fantastic burgers here (just not quite as good a deal as they used to be). I would say some of the best in the city.</text>

Awesome burgers, has a homemade catch, Friday evenings are popular, this is one of my favorites primarily because the food is fantastic and my company never disagrees.<//Review>

Great atmosphere (almost UK pub like), excellent food, prices at the point that is almost a steal for the quality, unassuming outside appearance, great drinks, great bartenders and service, good music (even the jukebox), not pretentious.

<Review>It seems they no longer offer a happy hour :(

If you check the Google reviews of this restaurant, you'll notice that "happy hour" the top keyword mentioned and probably weighs heavily into the older ratings.

I'm kind of torn because I was on an emotional roller coaster watching Balboa's original location almost close, then come back even bigger. I called and they said they've done away with their happy hour menu which is kind of disappointing because their regular prices have gone up a fair amount.

I understand the pandemic situation and that restaurants have struggled this past last year, but it seems like a lot of places are too good to offer any kind of incentives to loyal regular customers anymore.

The burgers are great for purists who don't want a sauced-up, condiment-laden burger that hides the quality of the meat. Are they worth regular menu price? For me, I don't know -- I want to support the Balboa but now it seems an out-of-reach luxury I might have to regrettably pass on in the future.<//Review>< Pics>

The garlic fries are meant seriously, so not for the first date;)
