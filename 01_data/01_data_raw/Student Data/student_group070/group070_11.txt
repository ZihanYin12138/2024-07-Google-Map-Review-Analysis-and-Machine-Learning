It is such a joy to go to class after work and learn a language that I've always wanted to know. The Kaplan International Languages - Los Angeles Westwood has a comfortable, convenient, and friendly school environment. Students and staff share the mutual interest of worldly communication. The tuition is reasonable and the lessons are top notch. I am so happy that I enrolled!</Text>

Great experience for learning English! There are many other schools and online courses, but for Kaplan it’s worth extra for the full immersion experience. There are opportunities out of class like Business English and real-life project based learning. Student ambassadors make the newcomers feel more welcome, and there are fun activities planned so that students make the most of their experience in LA.< /text>

I just want to share by experience at Kaplan Westwood for future students and hope it will guide them through.

I enrolled for a 12-week program called “Intensive English Course” (the only difference with General English course is that we had class in the afternoon). And also I chose one of the housing plans through the school.

Generally, I would say that I really liked Westwood, very friendly neighborhood and the long stay in Los Angeles.

Concerning the school, the program did live up to my expectations at all. After the placement test, I joined the advanced student class. First, I would say that I was extremely disappointed with the teacher who did not help us improve our skills. It was like a dull English class and nothing innovative about it. My main purpose was to improve pronunciation but the subject was never brought up. And about the afternoon time, we used to to watch the TV Series “Friends”. For the housing, I chose to share an apartment with 4 students from Kaplan, the place was filthy, maid barely came to clean it up. The overall experience was not what I expected.
I think that UCLA extension, across the street, has a variety of English programs and is more expensive as well.

If you are looking to spend some time in LA and refresh your English, please stick with the General English course. I believe Kaplan does a better job preparing students for exams like the TOEFL. Maybe it can be an alternative.</review>

Bad school. They cant teach you properly. Some teachers just want take your money.Also activities are very bad and usually cancelled. Maybe 2 or 3 people wants to attend. And they cancel it. In classrooms most of the students plays with their phones. And teachers doesn't do anything about them. No one wants to talk and teacher does not push them to talk. So always teachers talks.

Their accomodation options are really awful. They put me dirty hostfamily house. I couldnt sleep at night. They did not help me about that. So I found apartment by myself. They did not care me.

Waste of money.<//Review>

I was a student here. With high tuition they even don't give the audio of two of their main books to students, therefore they have to complete a 3 months course for about $6000 tuition. I only have 2 large books without any audio for all skills, except reading.</review>

Firat of all, it takes too much time to do any administrative procedures at here. It took FOURTEEN DAYS to finish simple and single paperworks because a staff who did the work was so sloppy. Second, also there are lack of explanations about necessary information. And if there are any incidents, it's all your responsibility. Third, You can't even contact directly with them in office hours by phone. So you need to talk with Kaplan headquarters and wait them until they send an email to Kaplan International English in LA AGAIN. Such a retarded, old-fashioned administrative system and amateurs who don't want to fix these problems.<//text>< Pics>

<review>I studied for a month in this is school, and my experience was AMAZING! I made friends from all over the world that I still  talk to.The teachers were great also, we were able to learn english in a funny way, talking about important topics with different people and get to knowing their point of view, and it was amazing for me as a lover of different cultures.
The school is located in a strategic place, a bus away from Santa Monica Beach, and really close to UCLA, lots of restaurants and a big mall located at Pico Blvd.

I satyed just 3 weeks studying in this school, and as soon as I get there I did a test so they could fit me in the best level, but what happened is that they put me in an afternoon class, that was terrible since i was just staying for a couple days and a big city to visit! So what i did was talk to them, and they were really comprehensive, and 4 days later i was in a morning class!

Kaplan is a great experience that worths every cent.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>(Translated by Google) Very bad experience I don't recommend it, they are not clear and the most of the teachers are not native speakers but don't be fooled, they put native speakers in the front desk ONLY .. don't GET risk to study abroad with them, it is not different about studying in your country Do Not focus on school name, focus on the Quality of teaching ....
Institute very very very very bad, I would never recommend joining it, most of the language teachers have, English is not the mother tongue, are not clear in dealing at all, they have a permanent shortage of staff, and they are never organized random work, never be fooled by the staff at the reception that they are from First language English speakers, teachers are most of them. As I mentioned earlier, I studied in three institutes and they were the worst. Do not focus on the name and fame of the school. Focus on the quality of teaching.
By God, by God and by God, I do not want to happen to me to be repeated with a second one, and this is the goal of the Comment, and God is as I say a martyr.

معهد سيء جدا جدا جدا ، لا أنصح أبدا بالنضمام له ، أغلب مدرسين اللغه لديهم ، اللغة الإنجليزية ليست اللغة الأم ، غير واضحين في التعامل أبداً ، لديهم نقص دائم في الموظفين  ، و غير منظمين ابدا عمل عشوائي ، لا تنخدع أبدا بالموضفين على الإستقبال بانهم من متحدثي الإنجليزية كلغة أولى فالمدرسين اغلبهم كما ذكرت سابقاً درست في ثلاث معاهد و كانو الأسوأ . لا تركز على إسم و شهرة المدرسة ركز على جودة التدريس .
والله والله والله إني ما ابغى الي حصل معايا يتكرر مع احد ثاني ، وهذا هدف الكومنت والله على ما اقول شهيد .< /review><Gmap_id>0x80c2bc8189046cf7:0xafd2080d952485c<//Gmap_id><name>Yousef Faisal</name>< user>

<Text>(Translated by Google) In this school I was preparing to pass the gmat exam, lessons twice a week for 2 hours for the first six weeks, and the remaining 4 weeks for one lesson per week. I do not recommend this school, most of the time you do it yourself, the teacher is unskilled. Can not answer the questions asked, she herself reads everything from the book. In the quantitative section, it is generally zero. It is better to be prepared in another school or at home. In vain, the money was spent.

(Original)
В данной школе готовился к сдаче экзамену gmat, уроки два раза в неделю по 2 часа первые шесть недель, и остальные 4 недели по одному уроку в неделю. Не советую данную школу, большинство времени занимаешься сам, преподаватель неквалифицированный. Не может ответить на заданные вопросы, сама читает все по книге. В quantitative section она вообще ноль. Лучше подготовится в другой школе или на дому. Зря деньги потратил.</Text>< user_id>

Purchased a set of three KVR16R11D4K4/64 Kingston 64GB kits to accommodate a kit of this ram I already owned. Bumping total system memory to 256GB. Memtest86 passed with flying colors after installation! Thanks to Servers4Less for a fantastic deal!< /Review>

<Review>Ordered a decently priced cpu that was in stock on their site under multiple different SKUs

They cancelled it the next day saying it's out of stock. It's still in stock.

Edit: Their response; "Our website connected with inventory system and it will be updated soon."

It's been a week or so and the same cpu is still listed as in-stock for over 3x the price I paid

Edit2: same cpu is still three times the price in stock. they haven't replied to my tickets< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80dd2a13fecfb58d:0x585590ce5ab954a1</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Great value, exceptional service.  Found the best price on the items I needed here at Servers4Less.  There was a delay in the order and the company upgraded the product I ordered to compensate, truly exceptional.  Very happy, will check here first going forward.<//Text>

<text>I'm giving 5 stars because I got exactly what was ordered. I ordered an Intel CPU, and -- partially my fault -- I thought I was purchasing the retail box, but I ended up buying just the chip. (Turned out fine, but I think the web site needs a little tweaking to make sure it's crystal clear. I ended up having to buy a CPU fan separately that I thought I was getting in the retail box.)</text>< response>

They sold me a hard drive that did not look like the picture they showed on their website and the description was inaccurate.  They refused to make it right and said if I returned it, they would charge a 20% restock fee.  You have been warned!  Make sure you can live with an item you did not order.<//Review>

Cancelled my order claiming "out of stock"  Just days later the very same VERY RARE Hard Drive magically appears BACK on their site "In Stock" at MORE THAN TWICE the price.   I see another review from just 2 months ago.. someone with the SAME issue.  This is apparently  a habit with The Lying  Sleazes<//text>

Servers4Less was able to provide replacement memory for an older model workstation (Server).  The order placement was easy, follow up by phone was easy, the shipment was fast and free and the part received was exactly what was ordered.  I am glad that they are available to serve the Server market.< /Review>

<review>These folks are very customer-centric.  Bent over backwards to try and meet my battery needs-a laptop battery no longer supported by Dell.  While the 3rd party battery is not as rubust, that does not reflect at all on their customer focus.

I'd give five stars, but, 1) the web site implied the product would ship right away, and 2) The delay wasn't communicated to me until I contacted the vendor.  Mistakes are made.  We all make them.  Open and honest communications makes all the difference.</Text>

<Review>Poor customer service. Critical order did not ship on time after I even called after I placed my order to verify. Shoddy excuse that my 1pm order was past the cutoff time for it to ship Fedex but it is 5pm the next day and they still haven't picked up. Then I called back to find out and the rep said she would have to check with the warehouse and she never contacted me back. Then I called to speak with a manager and he was able to find out in about 1 minute that the order did not ship and made up the excuse about my ordering it after the cutoff time. I needed my order the next day and paid for it to be overnighted. No additional help offered.<//Review><Name>Jeff Mang< /Name>< Response>

I paid $30 for expedited shipping (1-3 Day Express) and my product was not shipped for another 2-3 days! Requested updates, which were sent with 'read' receipts so I know they were opened, yet they wait until the latest possible moment to respond.

I barely had any wait time between “stations”.  They double checked some things based on a random comment of mine about light sensitivity.  They are always real in their friendliness, not just polite.  I feel like I am well cared for at Shasta Eye Medical Group.</review>

I had a very good experience-I was seen on time and the technician who did most of the eye testing was very pleasant and efficient. He explained procedures and answered questions in good detail. I appreciate the extra effort staff made to get my eye scans just right, they performed one test/scan a few times until they were satisfied with the results.</text>

The staff was great and worked quickly to assess any possible damage. Luckily, just some inflammation and some advice to wear eye protection during nerf battles. Dr Thompson was very kind.<//review>< pictures>

<username>Anya Polen</username><Review>I came in for with a simple request to renew my contacts prescription. I don't doubt the qualifications of the doctor, but the management of the group is far from being a smooth experience. Everything that could go wrong went wrong.
1. One and a half our wait to see the doctor
2. Staff doesn't know what they are doing, constantly in training, asking others
3. You get passed along to a bunch of different rooms and it's like a broken telephone, they mess up their notes all the time.
4. Front office staff is constantly yelling at the elderly patients thinking they can't hear them (in some cases it sounded awful)
5. My sample contacts were forgotten to be ordered
6. Whey they finally came in after 2.5 weeks, I picked them up and called that I confirm the prescription. It turned out they labeled Right and Left on the wrong boxes (bad mistake and I have a photo to prove)
7. Prescription was mailed a week later (not right away, like promised) so I had to drive again, for the fifth time, to pick up my paper prescription.
8. When I asked why optometry group (glasses store) never returns my voicemail, I was told that they don't have enough staff to cover and return people's calls. Seems like a poor excuse.
I honestly think people should not go to this practice...ever.<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>I just want to thank Sara, the clinic manager. She truly made my day with the way she treated me. She is the most amazing and helpful person I’ve ever met at any clinic I’ve been to. She showed me that she truly cared for me and not just for my money. I am so thankful for her. She is one of a kind. Thank you for caring so much. Shasta Eye Medical Group is so blessed to have her as the clinic manager.</text><resp>None</resp><Time>1544483591211< /Time><userid>111138839342822671483<//userid>< pictures>

I was greeted by Erica (I think she's a manager, everyone else was busy) when I arrived and she was just the sweetest person. I loved her energy and how on top of things she is! Im an internet shopper so i had lots of questions that she answered without hesitation or making stuff up like other places have in town. She did however talk me into a new pair of glasses that actually fit me perfectly, so i did end up spending more than i thought I would have just fixing mine. BUT; i’m in LOVE with my new glasses. If you wear glasses, you KNOW how valuable a perfectly fitted pair are!  Thanks Erica for all your help! As busy as the store was she still took the time to help me out and answer my 1000 questions. Safe to say this is now my Go-To place in Redding.</Text><Rating>5<//Rating></record></dataset><record>

I will never ever go there again, I took my 83 old mother in law there today.   None of the staff had gloves or masks on, we were not 6 feet away from each other,  there were a lot of elderly people there, they were putting eye drops in her eyes and had no gloves on!!  Why why would they do this to our elderly, because they get money!! Shame shame on your group, I am so disappointed<//text>

Fantastic experience at this facility. The staff were ALL amazing to me. Dr. Crum was great, took very good care of me.......I’m retired healthcare, and have been around ALOT of doctors. This guy was professional, kind, caring, and I would not hesitate to recommend him and his wonderful staff to anyone.< /review>

<Review>STAY AWAY.  I have never seen a group of people as incompetent as these jokers.  While the surgeon who performed my surgeries was nice and extremely professional (even giving me a follow up call himself just to see how I was doing), the billing and scheduling departments leave MUCH to be desired.  After insisting that there would be absolutely no co-pays or any extra charges for my surgery, I received a bill stating that I did in fact have co-pays and additional charges.  Upon disputing this with the billing department, I was told "but it's not our fault!  We billed everything correctly!! (even though my insurance tells me that's not the case)"< /Review>< pics>

<review>I had a  bleeding in my left eye almost 10 weeks ago and the following morning  less than 18 hours after the bleeding append which caused me to have very foggy vision I went to meet my Doctor MR. Trent. They examined my eyes and found that my diabetes is what caused the problem and he gave me a shot in my left eye that is to help my eye to have clearer vision . The shots every five weeks are making me get back clear vision. I have been seeing Dr. Trent got several years and I have always been happy with what he’s always had to tell me about how my diabetes will effect my vision as I get older and if I don’t keep my diabetes under control. So I think he is a great Dr.< /review>< gmap_id>

Couldn't be happier. Very professional and pleasant staff. I had cataracts removed from both eyes. Dr. Silverstein was thorough in explaining the procedure. He followed through with a phone call to see how I was doing and if I had any problems or questions. The medical staff made me feel comfortable and assured prior to and after the surgeries. I highly recommend them..</Review>

<Text>First of all, I like to start off by saying," DOCTORS THAT OVER BOOK THEMSELVES! When a patient comes in and their appointment is  at 7:30 in the morning & you make them wait for a half hour or more, your "OVERBOOKING!!" at the expense of the patient. Dr Lin, you should know better! lets just take a hypothetical situation, each patient of yours came in a half hour late or so,would you take them in? -----I'll answer that for you----NO! THERE IS MORE IN LIFE THEN THEE ALL MIGHTY DOLLAR!</Text>< pics>

Be very careful before giving this place your business.  I was traveling recently and had a potential eye emergency while in Redding.  When I called, I told them I had vision insurance.  The told me they would be happy to take that insurance.  When I got there, they changed their mind, saying they would have to bill my medical.  My medical declined it.  Now I am stuck with a bill, and after several very frustrating conversations with their staff, it's clear they use deceptive practices to get patients in the door.  Since I am in health care, I am aware of proper patient care approaches and business practices.  I am appalled at the treatment they gave me.   Their doctor did a good job, but I cannot recommend this business.<//text>

My only problem after leaving my right eye hurts from having the pressure test taking four times approximatly after it came out of from the mumming medicine used for the pressure test.

I called in on a Thursday to see if they could accommodate me the next day for a cut and color. They said yes, to come in at 10:15. I show up, and there is only one stylist working. When I got there, she was finishing up a client and just took back someone who was doing a full color. I didn't want to waste my time while she was trying to juggle two clients at once, so I left. This shop also only takes cash, which was also an inconvenience for me. The shop looked clean and nice, but just poor time management.</text>

Very Unprofessional and Rude Customer Service Ordered  a whole chicken and the butcher didn’t cut it properly told him to fix it and he started yelling at me he put it in bag and told me to go away
I came to the cashier counter and the owner was there he is one of the rudest guy ever you will see didn’t have courtesy and when I complained he told me you need to shut up when you order and be quiet and tip of that he said you cannot use card if less then 10$ mine was 9.94 $ I just told him keep your chicken and I don’t want it he yelled and said you have to take it and pay because you ordered it to cut I just left the store he kept on yelling at me
What a attitude I would really suggest if anyone wants to get insulted or spoil their day please go there There are other
Places where they respect you and the prices are also much more better<//Text>

Rude and unaccommodating customer service. Cashier dosent mention that a bag fee before paying. After paying for purchase with card he insists that $0.1 must be paid in cash and not card. Not everyone has cash all the time. If you have a bag policy let the customers know before they pay with card to add to the bill. Or at the very least accommodate your customers.<//review>

< Review>
I had a bad experience about goat meat. I took 15 LB goat meat which I paid $153.00 and after they took inside to cut and when I came home and weight it it came to 12.30 LB which is 2.5 LB Less meat I spoke to the owner to which he said it's after cleaning the 2.5 LB goes in waste from the meat which he is lying. Make sure someone in cutting section is removing the meat and cheating the customer.
Not reliable to buy meat I had a bad experience of cheating.<//Review>

<review>They don’t respect people time. I checked with them on phone couple of times that when they will close the meat section and arrived 30 min earlier then the closure time. Once I reach there, the section was already closed and meat section person was reluctant to entertain even.

This is an abuse of the situation. Just because there are very few places to get halal meat, these people think they can sell anything and in any way. Although there prices are high, meat cutting is pathetic and on top of that this attitude towards customer service.

I will be avoiding this place going forward.< /review>< Pictures>

I used to shop here once or two weeks once and one time i did not meet the minimum amount for card. I even requested the cashier to charge transaction fee but he was very stubborn and ended up buying more items . Next week I saw customer paying through card for even less than $10 and I dont understand the card policy inconsistency.Also they will charge you xtra for the bag without asking .

This store is under new management. The owner is rude and needs to understand that his business runs based on good customer service. In an area like ours, there is  no shortage of quality halal markets.</review>

<Text>This place used to be great. I have been buying meat from this place for about 4 years now. As another reviewer pointed out, after the new owner came in an year ago this place has become worst! Meat is stale (especially if you buy on tue, wed, thu) and sometimes it continues till fri, sat. Some of the Butchers are very rude and backed by the owner. You have lot of better options nearby.< /Text>< pics>

<response>None<//response><text>Extremely rude guy. I called in to find out if they have khichara masala that we wanted before I drive up all the way to their shop. This guy picked up the phone . I requested him to check if they have khichara masala in stock, he said he can't. I requested again, he said he's busy. I said I can call back later, he said no no no (3-times with lot of agitation in his voice)...I can't...and than he just hung up on me. I was terribly disappointed. I've been there few times to buy meat but they just lost their permanent customer. This is especially frustrating because 1st my wife called (who's an American) and she was really exited to cook "Khichara", but he did the same to her, I thought maybe there was some language barrier, so I called, with the same result.< /text>< Name>

<review>Breakfast here is superb as always. With covid restrictions lifting we were sat inside, it worked out as it was a windy day. Food came out quick and was spot on. Pancakes, potatoes, eggs, and hamburger are all recommended. Having good company helps. Can't wait to go again and indulge. Oh yeah the chocolate milkshakes are the perfect dessert.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Nice place, good down to earth food.  Easy to find on a main road if you are willing to wander further down the beaten path.  It is a local favorite, generations of family members have been going there.  Wife and I had the trucker's breakfast split on two plates and it filled us.  The bacon was crispy, the sausage flavorful, and the country time fries great.  The orange juice was good, I think it was fresh squeezed so taste will vary.  If two are splitting order another drink.
The food I saw others eating looked flavorful and copious.   There is outdoor seating but it is right next to the main road, but for us the sound wad not a bother.</text>

Warmly welcomed by a nice young lady who promptly brought coffee!  Without delay our order was taken and brought nice and hot with all the fixings.   Egg scramble and potatoes with green onions that are to die for -seasoned to perfection.  Swirled rye toast, buttered with a tasty jam.  From Paris to Central Park, this breakfast ranks right up there for memorable taste.  Great country music playing too.  Mr. Mom you are a success.  We'll be back...even if I have to drive from Alameda.< /Text>

<review>Basic American Cafe.  On the pricey side for food and atmosphere.  Service was friendly.  Food was typical and good.  However, disappointed with country biscuits.  They were wonderfully baked, tasted great, but instead of serving room temp, the biscuits were steamed to hot temp which made the texture soft like a bread instead of a biscuit.  Personally I prefer the baked crunch on a biscuit.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I wasn’t a huge fan of the sourdough toast, but that’s just me. Our server was fabulous! Didn’t catch her name, but she was the young one with the tattoos. The rest of the staff seemed pretty damn awesome too. Mr. Mom’s will definitely be our go to when we’re in Petaluma.</review>< pictures>

Never disappointed when dining at Mr. Mom's!  Food is always fresh and its all made from scratch.
Today was extra special because Tom sat with my husband and myself as we were having breakfast and we had a very lengthy, interesting and heartwarming conversation.
Tom is a very special and exceptional person.  We feel fortunate to know him!
God bless you, Tom!!< /review>

Wherever I travel, I patronize locally-owned business (instead of corporate chains) and I tip well for good service, because I was once a waitress.

At Mr. Mom’s food came quickly. But apparently, if you are a solo female dining at a booth, prepare to be ignored after the first two coffee refills. 🤯

(Added one star because I was able to share my concerns with another sympathetic staff member before leaving.)<//text>

My country gravy is one of a kind,, bacon ham baste made from scratch. Southern style. 99. 5% of restaurants serve sausage gravy.. usually canned or powdered.

All the trendy, pet friendly, Petaluma breakfast spots had long long lines so we ended up at Mr. Mom's. Good, inexpensive, home cooking, with pancakes the size of dinner plates.  Nice patio dining to accommodate dogs. Originally built in the early 1950's as a truck stop when the 101 ran past it. 1950's diner decor inside.  Nice place with decent coffee.< /text>

Mr mom's is a no nonsense diner with solid food and friendly staff.  It has a family atmosphere with pics of Mr Moms family u p on the wall.  He is a real dude who loves to cook and he is fast on the griddle.  Not bad at all.  Can't really go wrong with anything you order.  Spot locals love</review>

Food tastes exactly as advertised, waitress, owner and customers look, talk as they almost acting to create atmosphere of the original truck stop diner that somehow still  exists in very changed modern day  Petaluma< /Review>

Outstanding, classic diner breakfasts. Biscuits and gravy are excellent, as are the different Eggs Benedict dishes. Service was great and they allow dogs on the patio.< /review>

Fries were soggy and bland, food was mediocre. Grilled cheese was small, only American cheese. Service was great, patio is nice if kinda loud (but there's nothing they could do about that). We had the grilled cheese and the tuna melt.< /text>

<pics>None< /pics><Review>Nice little diner. Not a "step-above" as another claimed, it's an actual diner. Portions are plentiful without being over-the-top. The gravy is good, (not "amaze face", whatever the hell that even means...) , thick and cooked down properly. Good flavor but just not quite savory enough. Friendly, helpful staff. I would recommend and definitely come back.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Love this place. Don't let it's rustic small town look fool you. They have great options, great staff, and if you're from the south and you know what good biscuits and gravy are you will appreciate the recipe their cook has to offer.< /text>

Generous and tasty portions for a good price and very friendly, attentive service. It's off the beaten path, which I think made it not too crowded, but our 2-top table was next to a booth that had patrons looking at us while we ate, which was a bit uncomfortable. I'll definitely go back, but ask for different seating.<//review>

<Review>Great find! Home cooked sale meals, always spot on quality, great prices and freindly staff. The food tastes like a meal you would cook for yourself if you had the time and skill. Best prices in town..

Perfect for family and freinds hang out< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I rarely leave reviews, it's not often an establishment garners that kind of attention. But believe you me, this Diner is a cut above the rest. Best California Eggs Benedict I've ever had, bar none.< /Review>

Mr Moms is the classic hole in the wall like breakfast diner that knows how to do a 'bacon, eggs, and toast' just right. While the menu is nothing gourmet and the flashiest item is the probably the spicy sausage, you can't help but love the simplicity of a greasy spoon done right. For me, it's like Petaluma Hanks Creekside (In Santa Rosa).</review>

<text>(Translated by Google) Visited on Monday when it was a holiday on transfer. I ordered pancakes, eggs and coffee. If you think that the pancake of the picture is small, please feel at ease. I have not complained about being small, but they brought me one additional service from the store.
The pancakes were moist, dusty and very tasty.

振替で休日となった月曜日に訪問。パンケーキと卵とコーヒーを注文。写真のパンケーキが小さいと思ったのであれば、安心してください。小さいとクレームをつけてないのですが、お店から追加で１枚サービスをして持ってきてくれました。
パンケーキはしっとり、もっちりで非常に美味しかった。< /text><user_id>115266100246372407235</user_id>< GmapID>

Healthy Pet is an outstanding pet store. They go above and beyond with there knowledge of the products they sell to caring about their customers. I am a brand Ambassador for Nutri Source and I have seen them in action.  They truly care about their customers pets.<//Review>

<Review>Went into healthy Pet today for the first time.  Really friendly owners.  They talked to me about the different foods for my new puppy.  Both were very knowledgeable and helpful.
I checked out there foods that they recommended prices seemed very fair.  Didn't buy anything on this trip because I'm getting my puppies tomorrow and the breeder is giving me enough food for a week or so. I want to change the puppy food that the breeder has been feeding them because she buys her food from Tijuana Mexico and it's not available here in the USA.  I know weird ha she lives in Tijuana and you just can't buy the food here so I have to change food. Anyhow I think I will be buying my food from Healthy Pet because I want to help support small businesses in Thousand Oaks because I was a business owner myself now my wife and me are retired.

<Text>I wish I could give 10 stars Tyler in TO store did an outstanding job he knew my situation and my desperate pleas for some food that was out of the supplier, not only did he save them for me so I could drive down there which took me an hour, but he called all his other stores and had them save it for me too!!!  I made a trip to all four stores today to pick all of it up I’m forever grateful this should last me until the supplier gets it in thank you so much my kitties thank you</Text>< Resp>

Peter and the staff at Healthy Pet and cat are so attentive, passionate, and friendly. I get everything for my dogs and chickens here. There customer service is amazing and that's why I won't shop anywhere else. It is great to know that someone is looking out for the health and well being of my pets. Peter and the crew are those people. It makes me feel great Shopping here knowing they do their research on what's good and not.  Thanks you guys.<//Review>

Not the cheapest, but if your pets are part of your family and you love them, you should pay more for the best quality food and save on vet bills.
The only place we'll buy our pet food because they know their stuff and only carry good food.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I love this place, very competitive pricing and they hold several sale events throughout the year were you can get even better deals than the already great ones. As a family owned business their customer service is top notch and they go out their way to find something at another store or even from their suppliers if they do not have it.</Text>

I don't understand the negative reviews for this store.  Healthy Pet in Thousand Oaks is great!  A former big-chain shopper, I've been shopping here now for months and have never had anything but good service, and great advice.  With two GSD and an ACD we have our hands full and are glad to have a store we can rely on for the very best products and service for our wonderful guys.  They truly offer only what you can get from a local business!<//Text>

Thankful for small mom and pop pet stores like this one in Thousand Oaks. I love my dogs like they are my family. The big retailers like Petco don't sell high quality food like the one I use which is Orijen< /text>

Friendly, helpful staff. A large variety of wholesome foods and products for our dogs & cats. AMAZING. The staff is absolutely incredible. I wish I got the name of the lovely woman who took the time to play  and give him treats. This quick stop for dog food turned into loyalty to such an amazing pet store.<//Review>

< Review>
This place is great! I got my puppy Kobe from here 3 months ago he’s a German Shepherd Chihuahua mix. I was waiting to make sure everything with our vet was clear before reviewing this place. The first few months we got him were just typical puppy problems deworming and shots, nothing too drastic. He is such a joy to have around. We will definitely be getting another puppy and maybe even kitten from here. The only thing I wasn’t sure about was that they want you to get them spayed/neutered in a certain time limit. In reality when I told my vet about it he recommended that we wait a year. It all depends on the dog breed. Kobe still has some teeth to grow so unfortunately I might not qualify for my deposit. But I guess we’ll see when I get him neutered. I’m supposed to have technically done it in September, but my vet said he’s too young. Other than that, this place is great!< /Review>

I love this place. They've recently turned their pet store into a rescue and I love it even more. We took our kids to get Guinea Pigs the staff was awesome, very informative and helpful. They have Pups, Guinea Pigs, Rabbits, Cats, Chinchillas, Birds, didnt see any reptiles.

We are pleased with all purchases from Guinea Pigs to Pups from them and plan to continue to purchase or adopt in the future.< /Review>

We bought the sweetest Chihuahua here this week and love her dearly.  Our experience was very good.  The staff was very kind, helpful and informative.   All the animals were friendly and you can tell they are well taken care of and handled a lot.<//text>

They say they are a Rescue but perhaps. ....dare I say "puppy never mind.  They have the cutest cuddle bugs.  A resident giant peacock too. You can definitely find a fur ever friend there. Not just dogs and cats...</text>

Family owned business. Clean, staff is helpful with answering questions. Puppies, kitties, birds and guinea pigs for kids to look at (and maybe take home) and the legend Carl, who's the coolest store peacock! I love supporting a mom and pop shop!<//text>

She has another cat in the back named pirate that nobody wants because of his eye- she doesn’t have to keep them but she does because she makes sure any pets that go to that store go to a loving home or else she’s responsible for them. I will be getting my cat back because we just got a bigger home so I’m pretty excited to have my baby back. I honestly am so grateful she kept him and didn’t give up on him.

I liked it because they have a lot of animals that are up for adoption and need good homes, and for reasonable prices as well. They have a great selection of birds, cats, dogs, and lots of supplies as well as kennels cages and food and treats. I would highly recommend this place if you are looking to adopt a small kitten or a dog oh, the people are also very friendly and informational.< /text>

Never knew of this place until I was told they sold a dog food I was looking for. Went in and to my surprise, there were dogs in crates stacked on top of each other!  These dogs were packed in these crates and were fighting and biting each other!!! Some were yelping because they were being bit and one was so small it could not do anything but lay there and be bit and yelp! Someone needs to take these dogs from them and place them in a place where they are humanely treated....so sad!< /review>

<text>I had bought 4 adult guinea pigs and 1 baby from here about 1 1/2 months ago and they are sweet. But I have been back and forth at the vet for fungal infections and ringworm! The owner of this place says she takes good care of them, but fungal just doesn't happen overnight or stay that persistent and resistant to treatment, I will never shop here again. I should have gone some where, where a guinea pig person knows what they are doing. I found one after my visit here.</text>< pics>

<Review>I bought my dog there 3 years ago and she was beautiful and healthy. They have the cutest puppies there. My children and I go there sometimes just to look at the puppies we cant get enough of them.They have really good prices too.  My dog gets groomed there every couple of months and she loves it she has this i think im bad attitude when i pick her and she always looks good. The staff is really nice too. This place has lots of cute outfits and pet suppies. I look forward to going there even if its just to see the new puppies.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

Bought two kittens from here about 6 months ago. Theyre both my happy and healthy little monsters now. But when we first got them one was sick. They never told me anything about it at all. Said they were both healthy and played off him not really being playful as just a mellow attitude. Be weary of this shop</review>

Bad experience. Owner continuously just ignored my presence when trying to inquire about a potential fur baby.  Only question she sort of answered was when she pointed at the wall to answer a question as saying "ummm your answer is there" SMH
Older lady just has no customer service and can come off as rude.
Side Note:  Info on the the wall states all puppies come from rescues but all have different prices as if price based on breed or cuteness and not on age group, size as legit rescue groups . Couldn't find rescued group info when looking them up.<//Text>

<text>Absolutely great place and great service. This is not a puppy mill. Caring people with great knowledge and genuine passion for the wonderful animals they find homes for. They took the time to understand my circumstance and pair me with the perfect pet. Onsite de-worming and vaccination shows there commitment to health and care of the animals.<//text><Gmap_id>0x80c33683629b6dfd:0xc8599cc3b24b925e</Gmap_id>< pictures>

<Review>Mixed experiences. The mother is very professional and knowledgable. She helps as much as she can. The daughter on the other hand is worthless and rude. Does not try to do all she can to help a customer. It is very transparent who the passion to actually run the store.<//Review>< pics>

Absolutely horrible experience!!  This lady sold us a cat with fleas so now I have to spray no whole house and needed to put the car in the garage for the night. Before you sell animals you should know how to take care of them!!  Awful place and I will never be back to this dump where the dogs and cats are caged up in small little cages w no room to get around. Disgusting!!!!  Owner and the poor animals completely disgusting!!!!<//text>

Went there with the grandkids to find a puppy,  was not even acknowledge by the 3 employees working there.   Asked about a puppy and was told they couldn't take questions until after they finished putting their delivery away.   Seriously bad experience.< /Review>

They were rude and wouldn't even let us interact with puppies to see if we could get a connection but they said only can take them out of we were taking them to the register to buy them<//Text>

Is there like more stars to give this place. I've had several different sandwiches with different breads and cheese combo's. Very savory sandwiches. Been coming here for over 30 years. True.<//Text>

<Text>It was an hour before closing, so not sure if they just ran out of ingredients, but my cheese sandwich had literally two slices of cheese and the most pathetic shreds of lettuce I’ve ever seen. I felt sad while eating it. Sad for me, sad for the little sandwich that couldn’t, sad for the Sandwich Board.<//Text>< Pics>

I'm a turkey sandwich girl so this off-Park place that roasts their own turkey daily is the best around. Want that Thanksgiving-leftover-sandwich in April? Look no further. So good!< /review>

If you want a real sandwich this place will take care of you. Always fast and friendly service. The meat cuts are solid, veggies fresh and crisp and the bread soft and fresh</Text>

The pastrami and corned beef is what I go for here. I've had the turkey which they roast in house but it was dry and bland and I had the dark meat. Skip it and get pastrami or corned beef.< /text>

<Text>Great sandwiches! No frills! Just awesome food. They roast their turkey daily and you can choose light, dark or mixed on your sandwich. I prefer mixed on marbled rye (who has marbled rye?!?!) with everything! 😊 Always satisfied after a sangwich from Sandwich Board 😁😁😁♥️</Text>< Pics>

They make, by far, the best Turkey (baked on site every morning!) Sandwich on the Island, the country, the world! Ok maybe that's a little overboard lol. Trust me, they make a darn good sandwich!</Review>

<Review>Yum and quick and you get what you pay for in the best way. If I lived here, I'd definitely be a regular at this place. Two weeks in the area for work and I came here twice, which is saying a lot. Dependable and friendly customer service.<//Review>< Pics>

Roast turkey sandwiches are what you go here for!  They roast whole turkeys every day they're open and it makes for a tasty sandwich.  There are other choices available, but I always go for a turkey based sandwich, Jeff's special is my personal fave.  Limited hours, so it's a day time food choice.<//review>

Kind of a small, funky looking from the outside, but the sandwiches are actually great! Plan on getting it to go, because there's not really much seating. Good selection of drinks and chips as well.<//text>

I'm still going here since the 80's bc you won't find a fresher, more packed with all white turkey meat at $7 anywhere....family owned, Michael is a great guy, they cool off their turkeys right inside the screen door of the kitchen it's baked.....only a couple tables but it is known as takeout..can't be beat !!!<//text>

< Review>
I went here because of the reviews, and my sandwich was really good. The only thing that grossed me out was seeing while I was paying that they had someone counting out the register money with stacks of dollar bills and coins on the sandwich board! Money is notoriously germy. If I'd seen that before ordering I might not have!<//Review>

Really good sandwhich, prices have risen a lot though since my last visit. Nowadays they are charging 10 to 11 for their turkey delight. Which is pretty expensive for a sandwhich. However I will stress that it is an excellent sandwhich. Make sure to get mixed meat. (White and dark turkey meat)<//Text>

<Text>Probably one of my favorite sandwich shops to date right there with Genova's in Oakland. The edge is that the Board has the best turkey in town and the staff is incredibly nice and consistant with making the sandwiches the same each time. Not once throughout my high school years up to now have I had a messy constructed sandwich. Rich's Special all the way!!!<//Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

5/31/21 location for Amazon returns. Received a $5 coupon to spend at Kohl's. 15% off coupon for wifi. So I purchased a discounted sandal that I had not planned to purchase. Long line at register but it went fast due to many cashiers.< /text>

Went into Kohl's to drop off 10 seperately ordered Amazon returns. Store was clean, everyone was spaced out, and the Amazon counter was ready and available to help. I usually visit a locker for returns, but this time the only free option was going into a store. Glad I chose this Kohl's. Process was so easy and smooth even with 10 items. Good job Kohl's/Amazon.< /Review>

<review>Friendly employees. The dressing rooms are now open which is great!
99% of the time everything is well maintained. Always frustrating going through the clearance racks, especially when season are changing and there are more racks. Must be so hard for the employees to keep up with putting clearance items in the correct racks. Always a jumble of sizes even with the labels on the racks.</review>< Resp>

I believe it's one of the smallest Khols stote. However, friendly staff. The store is neat and all items are well organized . I would love to come here again. I found sales on many items. It's close to in and out burger. Great place to shop.<//text>

I love how quick and easy curbside pick up had been. Just make sure you have your barcode ready when you arrive makes everything go much quicker especially if there's multiple cars waiting.< /text>

EXCELLENT customer service and a NICE selection of clothing. MUCH better merchandise and attitude at this Blossom Hill location in San Jose. San Bruno location needs to step it up. Ugly clothes and a COLD energy!<//Text>

<Time>1603762530546<//Time><Rate>1< /Rate><text>I went to go return a few items and the employee that was helping me out couldn't find an item on the recipt because I guess their was an issue with one of the registers. Alicia was super nice though, but when she was having trouble the employee that was on the other register tried to help and seemed more annoyed and frustrated when she couldn't find the item on the receipt. She was even trying to tell me that they probably didn't charge me for it (making it seem like it was my fault), but I knew she was wrong. She even went ahead and said " so you didn't notice that you weren't charged 40 dollars for this item," when in fact I had gotten the item from the clearance section. A third employee showed up and then explained to them that there was an issue with the register and that it wouldn't take that bar code, so she went ahead and typed something else in and it ended up working just fine and I got my refund and the item was indeed on the recipt. What frustrated me was that the second employee who was "trying" to help was rude and her attitude was getting worse because she kept having trouble finding my item and was adamant about it not being on the receipt. If she doesn't like her job then why is she there. She didn't even say sorry for the way she acted when the third employee(again super nice) stepped in, she just stepped back as if she had done nothing wrong. I wish I could've seen her name, but I wasn't able to.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1603817805927, 'text': "Thanks for taking the time to share your review with us.

They have expensive brands, but they most likely will have a sale. I when yesterday and I got $35.00 earrings that were $14.00  because it was 60% off then some for $30 also 60% off and they were only twelve dollars. Then another brand but it was cheaper I bought some for 5.20 dollars less than the original price of ten dollars, everything was a good quality if steling silver, and the brand was really good. Also if you become a member then you get dollars off which really saves me from the taxes there.<//text>

Clean place. Helpful employees. I had to return something from Amazon. Had to drive 8 miles to process my return. Giving the store 5 stars. I would give Amazon 3.< /review>

Busiest time of the year and you only have two registers open. The line is extremely long with an over 30 minute wait which is totally unacceptable! And you’re curious why retail stores are failing. Do better!! Wishing at this very moment I had just ordered online.</text>

It's safe to shop at Kohl's During COVID-19 pandemic, sanitizer stations are available through out the store, the best place to shop for family clothes, shoes, home, kitchen, back to school for kids and many more.< /Review>

<text>Decent prices.. But the girl working the jewelry counter didn't know the difference between a lab created gem and a simulated gem. I had to prove to her what I said was true.
And the last Sunday before Christmas they only had 4 cashiers.. With a line that literally wrapped the store.. Just not right...
This is a management, manhour loading/scheduling issue.<//text>< rating>

I really like shopping at Kohl's, they have such a large variety of clothes for women, jewelry and cosmetics. I usually shop the sale items for the great deals. This store on Blossom Hill by Oakridge has very nice and helpful sales clerks.<//text>

She won't let you try stuff on, unless you buy it, then you have to return it. And repeat the process  over and over. I used to love this store, but do not shop here anymore because of her. I had gift cards I had to use, but I have told friends and family to not purchase gift cards from Kohls, anymore.
I tried to purchase perfumes on my last visit. I smelled the samples, decided on the one's I liked. I asked Pat if the packaged box , was in fact the same one as the sample bottle. She couldn't figure it out either. So, I bought 2, opened them in front of her and other customers in line.
They were the "wrong" one's.  So, I  returned them right there. This is an ridiculous policy!< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Works in a pinch. Easy cheesy quickly grab-n-go, waiting in line is not a problem. Depending on what you require they carry decent cloth to wrap yourselves up in. It's a perfect place to find a present, many choices to snag multiple departments to browse & buy a quality quick gift.<//Text>

Clean, organized, and lots of staff on duty to help. It was after 9pm when we visited and I was pleased to shop in a clean and friendly environment. The cashier was as happy and courteous. We were able to shop for a family of 5 in one location. As always, I left comfortable with my purchase total.</text>

I want to like this store more than I do. I see plenty of items I'd consider purchasing but seems like I almost NEVER find my size.... Br it shoes, tops, and undergarments. Come on! San Jose is a melting pot of every variety of people. They need to provide merchandise in every single size and lots of each. I may just stop hoping things will change and stop wasting my time at this store.<//text>

<Review>My wife and I went here because you needed a new dress to attend a party. Going in there the first thing we realized was that we needed to strip down to our undergarments because the place was so warm. Of course we couldn't do this, so we had to suffer through walking through a store that has absolutely no organization in the women's section getting more and more frustrated with being too warm and yet knowing that we had to find something for my wife to wear. I am giving a three-star because, we did find something.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

My wife and I went here because you needed a new dress to attend a party. Going in there the first thing we realized was that we needed to strip down to our undergarments because the place was so warm. Of course we couldn't do this, so we had to suffer through walking through a store that has absolutely no organization in the women's section getting more and more frustrated with being too warm and yet knowing that we had to find something for my wife to wear. I am giving a three-star because, we did find something.< /Review>

<Time>1502414282924<//Time><rating>1< /rating><text>This will be worth the read because it's actually quite humorous. First off I want to say that I love this store, their prices, and what they have to offer. However I have just received the absolute worst customer service experience of my life. I have never been to a store that doesn't walk you over to the section you were looking for when you ask where a certain item is located. Their phone line isn't helpful either, today before arriving to the store I called to ask if they had this certain shoe I was looking for and the lady on the phone asked for some sort of item number. How is a customer supposed to know an item number code? We don't. I asked her where I could find the number she said "it's there! The item number is there" and I asked "where?" (She didn't speak English very well) I resaid the brand, the shoe type and style and asked if they had it and she told me to call back when I know the item code and then hung up. This is why I went to the store and went to the customer service table in the back, yet that was no help either because like I said I asked where those are located and she said "those should be by the handbags and wallets" but didn't walk me over to where those were or anything. I ended up not finding the shoes. Worst customer service experience of my life.<//text><pics>None</pics>< response>

Khols#0983
890 Blossom Hill Rd
San Jose, CA 95123

The purpose of this review is to acknowledge the amazing team effort the Kohl’s on Blossom Hill has. Earlier this week, I went to Kohl’s looking for a particular item. I was astonished at how quickly I was greeted as I entered as not many stores still train employees to greet guests.
As I walk through the store, I observe how clean and welcoming the environment is at this particular location. A few minutes into shopping, I was approached by a Mr. Moises Juarez, whom I believe is the store manager at this location. Not only did Mr. Juarez go above and beyond in helping me find my items but he also seemed very genuine which only ignited my experience at this location. I have been working in retail and customer service for the past twenty years and so I know what great and what horrible customer service looks and feels like. To have a manager carry a wholesome conversation, remember my name, and still help me with my questions was by far one of the best experiences I’ve withheld at a larger organization like Kohl’s. There have been too many instances where I have shopped at larger retails only to walk out feeling ignored and pressured into buying something I didn’t necessarily want.
Overall, I feel that it’s extremely important to recognize not only Mr. Juarez but his team as well as they made my experience this week the best I’ve probably had shopping at Kohl’s.<//Text>

I had to go back and forth from the Gilroy one to the Blossom Hill one multiple times because they said I'd have to handle it at the original store. I did an exchange for some bras (that were the same ones/same sale) but were bigger sizes so it was a dollar or so extra for each one and ended up paying over $20 extra "due to the bonus bucks I had earned being revoked from a return" even though it was an exchange! I try to shop smart to get the most out of my money and ended up wasting HOURS of my time since I live in Gilroy and had to go back multiple times (also wasting gas). I know it's only $20, but I work retail and know how to take care of the customer/make it right and Kohl's does NOT know how to do that. I will definitely not be back after all this and will continue to warn anyone thinking of shopping there.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I like Kohl's pretty well. They have long hours on Saturday--they close at 11 p.m. And now a lot of Amazon returns can be done there as well.</text>

The employee's very friendly and helpful.< /review>

Decent selection, but some clothing items seem cheaply made. Also lines are long and slow and more attention could be paid to merchandising. Maybe they are understaffed? Issues don't seem new though. Still, good prices. I'll continue to shop here.<//Review>

Wow, this has to be the worst Kohl's I've ever been to.  There's no way to find anything as they just throw the clothes on randomly on hangers with no respect to the size listed on the hanger and then throw the clothes randomly on racks, that have size markers but those are completely disregarded.  I've seen garage sales that are more organized.  It's so bad, it's stunning.  Unfortunate, because I usually love Kohl's, but I will never go into this one again!<//text>

<userid>107468063958583515811</userid><text>Great deals!! I love going there. They send you coupons in the mail, 15%,20% and 30% off. If you forget your coupon they'll give you another one. If you spend $50 bucks they give you a $10 dollor certificate. When we went we bought a lot off things. As we were paying for them we used our 20% coupon plus the $10 dollor one and we used our credit card and they gave us another 15% off. We save heck of MONEY. Kohls is the place to shop. So happy 🤣<//text>< rating>

Unless you are a kohls member it is reaaly not worth shopping here. Keep  and eye out for there sales. This location is easy to enter and leave.  Large vareity of cloths . only one draw back dressing rooms are in the center and hard to enter and leave.<//review>

Messy, messy!  Cashiers are so pushy with credit.  I will not apply just to get a discount.  I don't give out my social security number for money.  I have a credit card.  Two, in fact, and I get actual cash back for using them.  Way more than any Kohls discount, and with a fraction of the interest rate.  They have a credit application quota, I get it.  But, any company that puts so much pressure on employees that it spills over to customers, should make you wonder why.  Why is that credit attempt more important than the product your store actually sells?  You can work retail anywhere.  Go somewhere that sells something honest.  Speaking of honesty, the last time I was there, a cashier accused me of stealing a dress shirt I brought in to match a tie.  It was like 2 years old.  Washed, worn.  Really?  Time before, the cashier was trying to get my husband to sign up for a rewards card.  I already have one.  I told her we don't both need one, I am the one who usually shops there.  My husband said he does every once in a while.  The cashier looked at me and said, "I guess you don't know everything."  I usually find what I'm looking for, but it is never a pleasant experience.<//Text>

<Review>Don't ever try to return anything here. You will be waiting over 45 min while a single cashier helps a line of dozens of people going  around the corner.
There was an error in their system and I ended up standing in front of the service desk for literally a half hour before a manager came around to help out. Then it took the manager another half hour to solve the problem. I wish I were making this up. It was a terrible experience.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x808e317ee607431f:0x14596c5fffb9bb34< /GmapID></record>

This Kohls was clean, which was a first in a ling time. The cashier was patient. If you think Kohl's is cheap then you don't know how to shop on a budget. The prices were insane.<//Review>

It's ok. Its Kohls. They fool you with super inflated prices that look marked down to about a normal price. The selection is super average at best. Shoe department is a joke.<//Text>

On Saturday March 10, 2018 I visited the store to shop for some shirts.

During this time I tried several shirts on in the dressing room and when finished selected the ones I wanted, checked them out at the cashier and headed out to my car. I then realized I didn't have my car keys. I frantically returned back to the store, knowing that I must have set them down somewhere within the men's shirt area. I checked with the Kohl's lost and found service department, and notified the available cashiers. None of which stated they received a report of any missing keys. I was frantic at this point since I was across town. My girlfriend and I spent almost 3 hours looking, and finally came to the conclusion that we were not going to find them. I then had no choice but to get a ride back across town where I picked up a spare set and returned back to the store. I found at this time it was 10pm and the store was open another hour until 11pm. We decided to take one last look! We headed in and spoke to (2) Store Clerks, Ramsina and Veronica. We explained we had lost the keys and they could see my concern. At this point, they went above and beyond to help us. After about 30 minutes one of them yelled out stating that they had found my keys laying on top of a mens pants shelf. I was so relieved !!!! I wanted to take the time to say how thankful I am that you have such great employees like Ramsina and Veronica. Without them I would have been in a world of pain. I really appreciate their outstanding customer service! Employees like them really make your store shine.. I think that they deserve recognition..

Thank you Ramsina and Veronica...

Stopped in to get some underwear. Great selection, helpful staff (they offered but it was a 12 second shopping trip), and good pricing. First time here and I'll return...for socks maybe.< /Text>

<Rating>2<//Rating><review>Jesus, long lines, very slow cashiers, won't call for help unless you ask them to. Noone knows how gift card works. Their website has a bug where you cannot enter a full number on your gift card. So the customer service at the store gave me a customer service phone number in order to process my gift card. Waaaa! But the customer service on the phone was excellent! Yay! Hence the two stars lol<//review>< Pics>

Kohls carries enough merchandise for the entire family. The prices are also very reasonable especially the sale items. We will continue to shop at Kohls.<//review></record></dataset><record>
