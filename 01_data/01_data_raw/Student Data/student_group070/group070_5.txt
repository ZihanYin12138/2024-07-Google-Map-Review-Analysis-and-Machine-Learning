I've been going to him yearly for 26 years now, so that should indicate my level of trust and satisfaction. Glad the office is open in this year of COVID-19.</Review>< username>

Have been seen here for the last several years. The office is fantastic- well organized, knowledgeable about all insurances and costs, always on-time and friendly. The optician is great; fittings are easy and he can fix anything that I have broken. I have cycled through several of the young associates and they have all been good and the continuation of care is remarkable. Dr. Mebine himself is the best!<//text>

<Review>Dr. Mebine is the best! He is very knowledgeable, kind and caring. I have been going to him for years and have always been well taken care of. Mark and Angela help you to pick out your frames and they both help you to choose what will look good on you and get you the best deal possible. If you need something quick- they are on it! The office receptionist is always kind and helpful. So glad to have this office in the neighborhood.< /Review>< pictures>

Such an inconsistent experience coming here. I've been a customer here for just over one year.  The optometrists and eye exams have always been pleasant but my experiences with Angela who fits frames and works on the sales floor has been most of the time positive and the last time really bad.

I placed an order over the phone because I lost a pair of glasses. Ordered the exact same frames again. When I came in to get them fitted it was clear  she was irritated with my not coming  in to place the order. Then when I asked why the same glasses were $20 more expensive, she was really frustrated that I asked to see the receipt  from my last purchase. She seemed irritated that I had questions about the price difference.

I told her either way I would pay and was perfectly happy to do so, just wanted to understand the price difference. When it was clear the frame price increased this year and that was the reason, she grabbed the invoice, dropped  it at the front desk and disappeared in a rush without a word to me. It left me feeling horrible, what did I do that was so wrong? I think it was a reasonable thing to ask to compare the receipts, right?

Really bad experience and I do think that was my last visit at Mebine's office. Such a shame because I liked coming to this neighborhood, really like the optometrists who were kind with me during my difficult first experience with contacts. I just don't want to be made to feel like a huge inconvenience by Angela again. Will have to find a new place. /:

They always take great care of me at Dr Mebine’s office - from the front desk to the Doctors, I’m always comfortable. I had a last minute request for an eye exam due to some pain in my eye and they were able to fit me in the next morning. Love this office!<//review>

Doctors are great—but no one called to let me know my glasses were ready—-when I went to pick them up-the girl who adjusted them was VERY rude—I understand it is Christmas week but if your office is open then you need to loose the attitude. Have been coming as a family for 25 plus years-work on the office help in the New Year< /text>

You were advised of dilation and the side affects at the time of your appointment, and were offered the opportunity to return for dilation free of charge on another day.  You chose to be dilated. Similar to when you visit your Dentist, there is a chance you will need a filling - you can choose to do the filling at that time or return on another day.\n\nWe make appointments for our dispenses because we value your time. You are always welcome to drop in to pick up your glasses or for an adjustment, we just can't guarantee that you will be helped immediately.\n\nWe are sorry if this was not communicated to you properly, and are happy to release your medical records should you choose to switch doctors.\n\nAll the best,\n\nL.

Both my wife and I had exams and purchased lenses with Mebine & Assoc.   I find this office to be inflexible when it comes to basic requests.   My wife decided to keep her old frames and just replace the lenses.  The worker refused to understand why she would want to keep her old frames.  They also push the dilating pupils exam and don't tell you about this procedure before your appointment.  It's difficult to do this and then go back to work b/c of blurry vision.   Every time you go back even to just pick up your frames you have to schedule an appointment.  Overall, not a pleasant experience.   There have to be better options in West Portal.< /Review>

<text>The doctor that attended me was very pleasant. I can't say the same about the lady that help me choosing the frame. She was somewhat aggressive and cold. She remarked that in her business she had to be very explicit because people often confuse things. I was not confused, I was just asking but she got irritated with a single question. She did not have to bring the case that people get confused because I don't know what and how many people she was referring to, which have no relation to me. It would have been easier and more pleasant keeping the dialogue with me without including people that perhaps had a negative experience with her.  I have decided to take my business somewhere else.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

We enjoy eating out. Yesterday we  found this superb restaurant which we didn’t know before. We spent a lovely experience there with high-qulity meal and a well-trained team and  a professional cook. We put this venue in our phone list  and we shall definitely return soon. We highly recommend.<//review>

< Review>
As a loyal Family Dollar customer, I would often wonder about this bright yellow neighboring restaurant that I found myself frequently parking in front of. It wasn’t until yesterday that I noticed a small line inside the establishment —  I finally told myself, today is the day I’m going in there and finding out what this place is all about. I soon realized, this owner-operated establishment serves two purposes, convenience store and restaurant. Today my friends, I will tell you about the delicious Filipino cuisine I found myself wholeheartedly enjoying.

But first, it is important to mention that this place is CASH ONLY!

Menu:
A good selection of popular Filipino foods (QTY 6) and side options (QTY 3) that offers a la carte and combo options. You can also order 3 different tray sizes for catering.

What I ordered:
Combo 2 with 2 side

-          Main dish #1: Chichen adobo

-          Main dish #2: Beef lumpia

-          Side #1: Fried rice

-          Side #2: Pancit

Cost:
$9.50. With tax it came to $9.99.

Review:
Delicious. 10 outta 10 will order again. The star of the show: BEEF LUMPIA. It came with a side of sweet & sour sauce. It is to my understanding, the Lumpia’s are what they are known for. You can order the Lumpia’s fresh, or frozen!

What I would like to try next:
Pork bicol express

If you are like me and you are open to trying out a variety of cuisines and enjoy supporting local business, definitely give this place a try 😊< /Review>

<review>This may be the best place to get lumpia in San Diego! I volunteered to order a tray of these for a Friendsgiving party and it was a hit! They close very early, but waited for me to get there since I called ahead and said that I was on my way.

I also got to try their pancit, which was great too. The lumpia was the winner here though. It was crunchy and very flavorful! I will definitely be back to order more for my next gathering!< /review>< name>

<text>They have the best lumpia in San Diego! Not only is their food amazing but they have the best customer service. I have called a day ahead to have large trays made and available for pick up outside of their business hours and they always accommodate. Their food goes the fastest at any party I take it to!<//text>< Pics>

I didn’t know they only accepted cash and I only had $11 on me. Very nice. I would definitely come back for their chicken adobo. I want more!</Text>< rating>

<Text>Food is good and served which, since it's cafeteria style. The lumpias are 50 cent each. The parking isn't the best, so it might be good to have two people visit so one can circle the block while another orders< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>The smell of the food was very inviting. As soon as I walked in, the food was hot and ready to be served. All the food tasted amazing and the service was nice and easy going. It feels very inviting to go and get food from Fredcel's. This was my first time and I now know why people say they have some of the best Lumpia. It was very warm but nice and crunchy and just pure amazing-ness. They do only take cash so you may want to run to the bank beforehand but it is very much worth it. I believe I'll be a future repeat customer from now on.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLxfo0JYSAsLaKV_rJYxbaFD3HW7R4-W0DgWY1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQvKaaJQFoIzZGNlI6Utkfn9w3czeySqwQ9BoY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

This is THE PLACE to get fresh lumpia in San Diego. I always get a tray of 100-150 for parties, and they are gone in no time. Cooked to coincide with your pickup time, fresh, and ready to go. Filipino Soul Food.<//review>

<time>1575758169841</time><review>I love this place very homemade and family-oriented . I love the lumpia and pancit. I order here for parties. The price point is great. You will be the life of the party if you bring lumpia. Make sure you bring cash. Closed on Mondays they also close pretty early.< /review><Rate>5</Rate>< gmapID>

We got lots of food for the mere price of around 15 dollars. The lumpia was great and may be considered one of the best Filipino restaurants I’ve been to, being part Filipino myself. Loved the service, food and atmosphere and looking forward to going back!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80d95442f90b8fcf:0xcc087c3cfafaa73e<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Off the street family hole in the wall! Although not really a hole as it can easily seat 28. Also old school with the counter tops that sell hair are products and women's purses. That's called character and along with large portions and low prices you get 5 stars!</review>< Pictures>

Yummy lumpias!! Their lumpias are addicting...especially when they're hot. You cannot just eat 1 or 2. The sauce is also delicious!< /text>

<Text>This is my go to spot for Filipino Food in SD. The folks that work there are super friendly & so nice. I’ve bought many Lumpia & Pancit to bring to gatherings & parties and they’ve never disappointed, people always loved the food I bring from FredCel. If you can get past judging the area, this is a great place to get Filipino food. So good & the prices are great as well.< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>Awesome food! And supper affordable!
Very friendly staff, as well as helpful and patient. Only thing is that they're hard to reach if your intentions are to pre-order. But once you're able to do that, they are very timely and punctual for order pick-up. Great for baby showers for Mass ordering. I've done it for at least two friends bby shower! These ppl are time savers!!!!<//review></record></dataset><record>

I'm addicted! I hadn't had lumpia in years, heard of Fredcel's. I live in Oceanside & drive south just for lumpia! Yum!!! Their homemade sauce is the best, you can buy extra.< /review>

<rate>3< /rate><text>The workers were extremely welcoming, but the food was a little bit bland.  I went with three friends, and we unanimously agreed that the meats were the best part.  Although you might get a bit messy, the different selection of meats were very good.  The pancit and the fried rice, were alright, nothing special.  The second to best part was definitely the lumpia.  The lumpia has a crispy outside with a warm meaty inside.  This was finely accompanied with the Chili sauce that they gave me.  In conclusion the food was pretty good, but I could have had better.</text>< pictures>

< Review>
It's great to finally have a Filipino restaurant a little closer to home, than to travel all the way to National City! And I was really, really, happy when I got there.  The plethora of Filipino goodies were all right in front of me!! I definitely got some pandesal, cracker nuts, and some other things.. haha

For my meal, I wanted to get everything that was right in front of me.  I ended up getting half/half pancit and fried rice, adobo, sisig, and the fried fish.  And of course, got my lumpia! I loved it, almost as good as my mom's cooking! ;) Will definitely go there to get my fix again.

The staff was very friendly, and weren't stingy on the portions.  And the prices were very reasonable... they have great combos at very cheap prices. Definitely worth it! Cash only.< /Review>

Did some drone flying from this park. Good location as you have many different locations to shoot. Can even get to the lake from here.< /text>

Very nice and clean place, bring your dog or mountain bike and check out the trails they have, very nice park so much you can do here, great place to take the whole family for a picnic, roller blading, hiking, etc, probably the best recreational place in the Hemet Valley,  Great job Valley Wide< /Review>

Beautiful clear waters and pleasant hiking trails. We visited during the 2019 super bloom and were very impressed with the flowers, however the 10 dollar parking fee in addition to the 3 dollars per person enterance fee seemed a bit high, but still worth it.

Don't forget your sunscreen!

Can't swim in the lake (it's drinking water) but boats seem to be welcome.<//text>

A very nice place to stroll, jog, bike without having to think of social distancing over a crowded area. Going up the hills to the lake is the best and also going down. The parking is kinda expensive for one time parking fee I guess than getting the yearly membership. I guess it's worth it once you go there often. There is a nice trail down there. One of the best that can be found here in Hemet/San Jacinto aside from Simpson park that we can be proud of.</text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>It was a fun little adventure and the scenic route let's me remember what my small town living was like. Enjoyed seeing the community and recreation use to feed the growing future generations to grow in essential fun activities that will surely benefit them in more areas of their life than just learning to develop team skills and working with others. It was a fun night though it ended too soon. Look forward to the next trip out there.< /Text><response>None< /response><time>1574617940453</time>< rating>

Beautiful grounds and great softball fields.  Pickleball courts are great.  Would love to see some SAND VOLLEYBALL courts installed in the future.  I know there are many in the valley that would enjoy that!</Text>

<Text>Cute affordable place to take your children swimming to cool off. I went one day it was drizzling they decided not to open. Even though it was drizzling it was hot hundred degree weather and they still refuse to open. It's just a bunch of kids that wanted to be inside chatting with each other and didn't care that the customers were outside waiting I don't think I will be returning</Text>< pics>

I had a really great time there with my daughter and granddaughter. What, I don't understand, how the table behind us had a collapsible cooler, they had chips, not your chips, fruit drinks, peanut butter and jelly crustables, fresh fruit,  like watermelon, grapes.....ect. it says that no coolers are allowed. My granddaughter was saying why do they get to have food and we have to go to the car and get are food. What the heck is the policy on bring outside food?  Other than that, it's a great park, and I will visit again. I just couldn't explain it to my 4 year old granddaughter.  You need to fix this. Somehow they got through your search process. Someone in your staff is letting some people go through, there was more there than just this one table.😔</text>

< review>
This past weekend my boyfriend and I ordered two pies one was the Gourmet Garden Pizza and the second was a vegan pie. I don’t know what they did but the pizza smelled like feet, and gave us upset stomachs. I called the manager at the encino location and instead of offering to refund us, or even show any sympathy she was very defensive and claimed there was nothing wrong with their pies. Between the very expensive pies and being sick I do not recommend this place. And it’s sad because I’ve placed orders from here before but this experience has turned me off. Do not buy.</review>

There is a small lot right behind it but I imagine that fills up quick in the day time or when they are able to dine in again. Got vegan build your own. DELICIOUS! Great vegan pizza from a not-fully vegan restaurant. I love that they give you a choice between Daiya and Follow Your Heart cheese because most places have Daiya only and that’s the worst non-dairy cheese made. Only thing I’ll do next time is ask for extra sauce. It’s a great pizza with the amount served but I’m a saucy kinda guy.</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNR2QSem7sOhkNeJX_TJAxT5jql0yD11Vx7gvcj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< response>

So many times I tried this place, disappointed every time.  It is nothing like the one that was in Woodland Hills, which was the best . This time we ordered spaghetti and meatballs, oh my God... the pasta tastes horrible. I don't know if it is left over from yesterday or if they freeze it and cook it again when someone orders but something is wrong with it.  The taste and the texture is very strange, plus lots of it is stuck in clumps and has a powdery texture when you eat it. The meatballs are pork I think,  hopefully cooked properly. The bread rolls are big, they come with frozen butter.  The salad is good. I stopped getting pizza from this place because it was not the same quality as the place in Woodland Hills.  Think I'm done ordering from here forever.  What a waste of money.<//text>

<Review>I was in a pinch because Starbucks down the street lost power and I called this pizza place and they said I could use the WiFi. I’d say this was good luck because it’s so much more cozy compared to Starbucks. The atmosphere is way better at The Pizza Cookery anyway! 10/10 for the mozzarella sticks too.</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPbfWrShpJwCkY8cJNcHxLFLQQ7DVVZtulBEnPU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< response>

Smells and look very good! But...
My bad mood was started in the first second. I was waiting cashier few minutes. Their prices was high, but I thought «hmm... may be that Italian family guys cooking very tasty. I want to try it!”. After I ordered “to go”, lady told me wait for 15-20 min. I was sit and start serf menu. And most important INFORMATION! They give free appetizers for good reviews! That’s the only reason why their rete good! We took pizza home and not surprised- it very bad. Not cooked well, terrible tastes. Worst experience and money spending! Not recommended at all!< /review>

I don't know where to start. I loved The Pizza Cookery in Woodland Hills, but that one closed so I tried this one. I want to clarify that the service was very good, but the actual food was a different story.

The minestrone soup tasted like it was reheated from several days or even weeks ago and it was mostly flavorless. The bread rolls were good and fresh. The mozzarella sticks were good, but not better than the ones you can but at a grocery store. The pizza was bad as well. It was like they took the dough for pita bread, spread canned tomato sauce on it, some cheese and pepperoni, then threw it in an oven to warm up. There was no flavor other than the tomato sauce flavor out of a can.

Sorry, but I will definitely not return.< /Review>

I was suprised by the quick delivery from Slice. The menu was easy . I though a little  $$$ on pizza which was not to my taste or my daughter who is a pizza freak. I also ordered the tuna salad which was wonderful  with ranch dressing. They give you big portions on both the small and medium size. Their garlic rolls are also wonderfully made. Again my daughter is also a garlic freak. I have ordered two different times and was pleased except for the pizzas.  They offer a wide variety of items from gluten free , vegan , pasta , sandwiches.  I will differently be ordering again.</Text>

<text>Oh, we just came from The Pizza Cookery!  The same warm family runs this amazing little gem of a restaurant. We've been coming since my son used to play with his tiny trucks and cars on the sawdust floor.  Now he's 23 and loves their generous and filling portions! They have the most delicious food and elaborate menu covering everything you could desire, even a wide selection of vegan and gluten-free options.  We always get the Pizza Special with their amazing salad and refreshing drinks.  Oh, everything was mouthwatering yummy!  The Pizza is loaded with cheese and your toppings, cooked to perfection.  The rolls are soft, with a buttery garlic flavor!   The salads are delicious and filled to the brim with salad and all the goodies!  Everything is brought with the warmest of service and they always remember what we love.  The service is excellent and friendly, their food melts in your mouth, the prices are great with so many options, the atmosphere is cozy with big, roomy booths, and they even have 3 big TVs, it's got something for everybody.  I hope you treasure it as much as we do.  It's our very favorite spot for Fantastic Italian Food and the Best Service!  Thank you Pizza Cookery!  We'll see you soon!</text>< pictures>

<review>Very good pizza and salads. I have been coming here since the late 70s, and the owners (2nd) have done an excellent job: the recipes have remained pretty much the same and, the quality of the food and ingredients is undiminished. They are known for their garlic rolls, their pizza (also available as gluten free) and excellent salads. Service here is always friendly. Prices are fair but moderate.< /review>< rating>

Good family atmosphere,  lighting is great, and just the service is amazing. The food tastes so good and it makes me just too want more. Especially the garlic bread they serve just makes me want more refills on it. I would definitely come back! Just stunning!<//Review>

Many other popular Itallian dishes are available. Sauces are full bodied, rich and flavorful, East Coast style. Servings are large.

Most of the menu is available as conventional, vegan, or gluten free. A selection of conventional meats, as well as, vegan "meats" and "cheeses" are offered. There are two menus: vegan/gluten free and conventional. The knowledgeable and friendly servers lead you through the decision making process.  Salads are large, crisp and fresh. Hot, just out of the oven, vegan dinner rolls, at extra charge, as well as, conventional rolls are served.

And, in the tradition of the Chicago pizza restaurants, a carpet of sawdust covers the floor.

The mood is intimate, perhaps a bit romantic. Wine and beer are served. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly.

Free parking in the small lot behind the restaurant and street parking. Wheelchair accessible including bathrooms.<//review>< Pictures>

My partner & I came here after searching for a pizza shop we might enjoy and no regrets. The pizza was really good. From the pastry to the sauce to the ingredients, they perfected it all! Even though, it was a bit pricey for the serving but really worth the quality.<//review>

Wish they had corporate approval to use a Garlic infused Olive Oil sauce as an alternative! The Spicy BBQ Wings is the best in my book compared to other restaurants! The manager does a great job with her staff, they seemed to be organized and very friendly! My favorite pizza is the Pepperoni, Red Onion, and two orders with no sauce! Plenty of Cheese on thin crust or Hand Toss. The store is conveniently located to my home location.<//review>< response>

The last time I was at the Encino store was in the 90's . I worked in a bank next  to the Encino store and I love their salad and Pizza. I moved to the bay area and been living here for a while and recently I had the chance to visit Southern California. My wife and I visited the valley and to my surprise we passed by the same store that I used to have lunch 25 years ago. We decided to have the same food that I used to eat and to my surprise the quality of food did not change a bit. Their salad roll maintained its quality and their pizza is as good as it was before. And that goes with the salad too. I would give a five star to this place.< /Text>

The pasta is awesome, but, the service leaves something to be desired. Service started quite normally, but, we were late diners. So, service towards the end of our meal turned quite sour. Our server seemed VERY upset. I was quite understanding for our late dinner so I left a generous tip even though I felt that we were rushed out and felt uneasy. I don't think I'll be dining here again.</review>

The pizza was so bad my stomach still hurts. Dry hard crust.Where was the sauce? Dry terrible pizza. This was THE WORST Pizza my date and l have eaten in my entire life. You would better in taste and quality to get a frozen RED BARON pizza which would  be better in taste than what I ate. Your pizza is overpriced and really
SUCKS. Never Again $#&#% The WORST!!!< /review>

I've been coming to The Pizza Cookery for the last 40 years and it's one of my favorite restaurants with consistently excellent food and awesome service.  The atmosphere is family friendly with a good vibe, it's not pretentious or trendy and it has the charm of being a place to kick back and enjoy your meal.

My favorites are the garlic rolls, the chicken wings are better than most wing places, the 5 cheese, BBQ chicken and meat lovers thick crust are heaven, the calamari is tasty and their Antipasto salad is incredible.  They also have a nice variety of beer and wine but the best thing is you're felt rushed to eat and leave like many other busy restaurants.

This is a family run business who does everything possible to make sure you enjoy your meal.  The prices are excellent, the portions are huge, the menu has something for everyone in the family, they use fresh ingredients and they also have a great vegan and kids menu.

There may be more trendy or chic places out there, but if you're looking for a real home cooked comfort food meal that's always a step above everyone else, the Pizza Cookery is the place to go.  It's been our go to place since I was a kid.<//text>

I got a small antipasto salad and it came with garlic bread rolls!!!! I ordered it to go and got home and the bread was hot and the salad was crisp and cold... Super yummy!!!!!! I didn't even need the butter they had in the bag because the bread was so good!!!! The salad and bread are easily enough to serve 2 people!!!! It was a little busy so I was worried it was going to take a while but it barely took 5 mins!!!!!! I recommend this awesome place to everyone!!!!!!! I will definitely be going back to try the gluten free options soon!!!!!< /Review>

They also have a big screen to watch sports while you wait or eat your food. The location is very clean. I prefer Pizza cookery over the other local pizza places.

Went here quite a while ago. There was a coupon that didn't have restrictions on it, but they said it wouldn't work for the vegan food. I understand it's a bit different for that stuff, but the way they treated us was horrible. Extremely rude service. We ended up ordering anyway because we were starving. The pizza I got was alright ( not as for as the woodland hills one).We took the leftovers home and I found hair in my pizza and ended up tossing it. I called them and they tried to resolve it, but after that experience it just wasn't worth it. I would just say to just go the Woodland Hills location; which has better service and food.<//Review>

Food is good. It's Pizza Cookery by name only. Except for the sawdust floor its not the same as the original. The rolls are just OK, the pizza was decent. Not a bad place just a little underwhelming.< /Review>

<Text>I love the authentic pizzas here.They make your order as you like it and fast. Sometimes I order ahead since my lunch break is only half an hour, and they have everything ready when I arrive.
My go to favorite is their tasty combo for one(pizza, salad, drink and almost forgot those addicting
rolls). How can you beat that for $8.99 !  See you soon for another one :)< /Text>< pics>

I tried to like this place, I did. But there were so many warnings signs...

Things I liked:
- The salad.
- Price on individual combo. Less than $10 for a small pizza, salad, bread & drinks is nice!
- Not noisy, big room.

Things I disliked:
- I hate places where I have to struggle to find parking.
- They didn't honor the Yelp Deal I paid for because they said the combo I bought was already discounted (but it's printed on the menu and therefore is not an "offer," but simply a combo much like you would purchase at a fast food joint.
- The Pizza. Sauce killed it for me, tasted like they bought some premade pasta sauce and tossed it on top.
- The floor. When I first visited a pizza cookery, I thought this was cute but later I started thinking it was terribly unhygienic. Do they bother sweeping when something drops on the floor? Can you even tell?</review>

<text>The pizzas were cooked too long, so the crust was tough. (Second time this was the case.) We ordered pepperoni and meatball, but got pepperoni and mushroom.  $71 for two pizzas and a salad is outrageous.  The to-go menus do not show the accurate prices, so were were unprepared for the high grand total.  We used to eat here often, but I think we are done.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

< Review>
My experience was really a mixed bag of good-bad-neutral, which in itself was kind of disconcerting.

I came mid-afternoon on a weekday, so I presume the manager had the floor while waiting for the next server. She seemed bored and uninterested, and disappointingly, she actually flinched when I admitted that I'd be using a Groupon voucher (seriously, it felt like an admission—like I'd done something wrong😟—going by her countenance).

That—and the utterly disappointing garlic rolls—constitute the "bad."

In contradistinction, the “goods” were d@*n good.  The garlic was fresh; the cheese was perfectly melted and the flavors robust. Also, when the scheduled server arrived, she jumped right in to her role [unlike the begrudging manager] and kindly checked in periodically.

All in all, the lesson learned is to go during peak hours.</Review>

<time>1421914318915< /time><text>To be honest I thought this was a pizza place but they actually have a variety of foods from bomb salads, to pastas, and so much more all at an affordable price!

Upon entering we were greeted by a hostess who sat us right away. Our server mike is awesome, attentive and super friendly! He refilled our waters twice without us having to ask, and he provided us with such great service and always kept checking up on us as well as asking how the food is and how everything's going every now and then .  Great personality. When you have delicious dishes as well as a really good service - your whole dining experience is 100x better.

We ordered pasta for our son which came with apple juice. The kids pasta I must admit  is large enough for an adult!< /text><user_id>104028011024437247975< /user_id><Pics>None< /Pics><username>Keith Hoffman< /username>< Rating>

<review>So I've lived in Encino for over 3 years now, and I'd sort of given up on finding a pizza place that was as good as my favorite LA joint. I do like Rusty's, but it's no Mulberry Street Pizza.

I dream of the big, floppy slices that you fold in half, with a slightly crispy crust, tangy/spicy sauce, gooey cheese, and lots of garlic. Little did I know that my perfect slice was right there on Figueroa Street the whole time.

It could be that most times I'm down in that area, But I lucked out last Saturday night -we needed a quick bite before a show and every other place was packed. It was open and only had one patron, so we ventured in. My slice was like the pizza I'd been dreaming of ever since I left LA. It was perfect, and I probably could have eaten half a pie if I'd had the time. My salad was also delicious with the perfect amount of what tasted like homemade dressing. My fiance got a panino sandwich with meatballs which looked really cheesy and delicious.

What made the experience even more wonderful was that we were both satisfied for only $17 total. That is unheard of in Encino.  Thanks and keep up the great service again.< /review>< Name>

This restaurant is the definition of a family restaurant. They play kids (disney) movies on the TV's but always have a couple games on as well.  It's a very nice relaxed atmosphere.  As far as the food goes, It's consistently very good and very reasonably priced for the quality of food you get.  From a pizza place I definitely did not expect the food to be that good, it beats the heck out of any place like that any day.  This is the type of restaurant when you want Italian food you go there 3-4 times a month.  Blissimo!< /Text>

We stopped in on a week night for a pizza and a antipasta salad. Service was excellent, the small antipasta was enough for two of us as an appetizer. Very fresh and excellent italian dressing. We had a specialty medium pizza with green peppers, pepperonni, mushrooms and sausage. Crust was very good, no grease on the bottam at all.  Will be back again :)< /Review>

Worst service I've ever been in the Valley. Today is Friday It was only a table with 4 people took 20 minutes to sit and another 15 minutes for the waitress to come. They were all in the kitchen chatting.
Never go there again.< /Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Name>DFred Ericks< /Name><Text>Visited family for the weekend and my uncle took us here during the local farmer's market. Lot of amazing food and nice people! There was also vendors selling a range of goods and it was interesting to see various types of art that I'm not used to. Would definitely check it out if you love fresh produce and supporting local vendors! I believe the farmers market is only on the weekends but I'd double check before heading there.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< GmapID>

There are usually musicians here during the Saturday Lakeshore Farmers market. there's food stalls around and you can sit here and eat, there are usually a small number of tables and chairs. At night it's just empty and nothing much to speak of, just a small plaza opposite the Grand lake theater.<//review>

The Saturday farmer's market is year-round, and well worth a visit. Restaurants in the Grand Lake neighborhood (on Grand and Lakeshore) are diverse and welcoming. The Grand Lake Theatre shows first run movies and include an organ player on Friday and Saturday evenings. A walk around Lake Merritt is a 3 mile jaunt well worth the effort.<//text>< Pictures>

Definitely worth visiting on a Saturday morning. Every Saturday there is a farmers market with lots of good produce and food to buy from vendors. My favorite is the waffle truck. It gets pretty busy around there, but you can ussually easily find parking close by.</text>

Nice little Farmers Market. Parking close is an issue but you're going to be walking anyway so what's another few blocks. Great produce, much from Watsonville I believe.<//Text>

Nothing gets rid of that grandpa truck look as good as a T_REX grille.  This is the easiest way to completely transform your truck from a  basic everyday truck to something that will make heads turn.  Everything is easy... ordering, shipping (well packaged), installation, fitment.  T-REX thought of everything and made the perfect product to make your truck like as aggressive as it drives.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0XA0V7XaVYaTdcf0SVjT-EVMc6xHRmOEzkGYg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< response>

Great Products and Great Quality, I installed the grille in a few hours myself on a Saturday including wiring in the light and am very pleased with the look and results. Their instructions good with a photo of each step on the truck it's going onto so it's not just a generic step by step list of directions.  The fit and finish are better than I have seen out there and the products come with a satin finish.</review>

Excellent quality. The factory grille was one of the first things to be upgraded, and this was by far the best option I found. Very impressed with the fit and finish.</text>

<username>David Ferrebee<//username><Review>Great looking grille.  Good Quality.  I have had it over a year and one half and through one WV winter where they use way too much salt on the roads and the finish is holding up great.  The only negative is that you have to be very careful when installing because the stud bolts are very soft and break easily.  Best practice is to thread the nuts on the bolts to clean the threads before beginning installation and then do not tighten much past what you can do by gripping the socket with your hand.< /Review>< Rate>

<Text>Could not be any happier with my T-Rex grill... very easy and convenient to install, very durable, and very affordable. Really gives my 2016 Ram 2500 a mean look that people can't help to look at when they see. Definitely would recommend T-Rex grills to anyone looking for after market grills on any truck!< /Text>< pics>

There were some issues with my grille. None of the issues were T-Rex's fault, but Tom over at T-Rex worked with me, solved my problems, and I got a pretty awesome grille out of it. I'm incredibly happy with them and the grille.</Review>

<user_id>108774716322091951489</user_id><text>I called these people to confirm the look of the grill - which was supposed to be all blacked out. They said it was. Ordered it- was missing the outer rim outside of the grill which was shown in the picture, and what I called to confirm.
Was false advertising, been going through RMA process for 6 months they have received the product back and still no refund. Had to go through my Credit card company 2 times to reject the charge. Ive called them over 10 times and they keep saying ya we will refund it... nothing.

What a joke - Dont order from these people.</text><resp>None< /resp><rating>1<//rating><Gmap_id>0x80dcc8e48c311ce3:0x174f71d29b233fd<//Gmap_id><Time>1473632519062< /Time>< user_name>

Gotta say, in the past few years, Divine Nails Spa & Beauty has really stepped up their game. They used to be nowhere near my favorite nail salon, but they're quickly rising to the top (there's a lot of nail salons in Glendora).

The inside is really nice and clean. Since they did the addition and added the second side, it's gotten way better. The interior is actually nice, and makes it seem like it's better than just some random cheap nail salon. It actually looks pretty high quality. They have really nice, new spa chairs. Gotta say, they're pretty fancy too.

The actual job they do on your nails is pretty good. I never have anything too fancy done, so I can't comment on that, but for the basics, they're pretty good.

The staff is nice and friendly. I don't think I've had a bad experience with them since they've been under new management.

It can be a little pricey, but then again, the prices of nails have gone up in the area, so that's not a huge drawback.<//Review>

<review>I enjoy going there, everyone is very friendly and the place is really clean. The only reason that I did not give 5 stars is because they dont do much with the dip as far as designs go. Other then this they are a great place to get your nails done.< /review>< pics>

Not really sure why there are bad reviews. I've had Lynn, Becky and one other girl do my nails. Always done great never have a problem with lifting or gel polish chipping.

I go in usually on my lunch hour.  I work across the street and it's conveniently located for me. If I call in ahead of time I can usually go in any day and get in and out in about 45 minutes. That's for a fill and a pedi.

My nails are coffin shaped (or square-letto if you prefer) and I usually go see Becky for that. Lynn does a great job too and makes sure you are very happy. The girls are nice and lightly talkative.<//review>

I went here recently and was very pleased with my full set that I got, Cindy was the one who did my nails and I am very happy with the result. I will go back just because of her. I also got my eyebrows waxed by another lady and wasn't impressed, felt like she rushed it and didn't really do a good job< /review>

<text>I called to ask what time I should come in for a mani/pedi and they said," Now is fine." I live 5 minutes away so I arrived quickly. It looked pretty busy but I was seated in a pedicure station right away. They kept me waiting with my feet in the lukewarm water for over 15 minutes (not an exaggeration because there was a huge clock in front of me!). It took nearly 2 hours to do my nails. My manicure came out great but the main reason I don't do my own nails is because I'm terrible with pedicures. The pedicure was awful! Paint was messed up and they were cut waaay too short<//text>< Response>

So so good.
I love the everything 🥯  from Bagels and Brew....and this one is practically the same. So happy about that. Pablo topped it with red onion, tomato, avocado and lemon pepper-- it was to die for!</text>

Took about five minutes of me standing there before the lady behind the counter took my order (or even made eye contact / acknowledged that I was waiting). Then took thirty minutes to get a single bacon egg and cheese bagel. I'm pretty tolerant, but this is absurdly slow.</Review>

Excellent pastrami, rye bread, and swiss cheese. Really flavorful everything.

It just didn't look like a $14 sandwich to mr.<//review>

I wouldn’t say I’m a frequent customer but the bagel selection is good and the cream cheese options as well. Honey vanilla is delicious. Occasionally I will splurge on an omelette before work and I always call it in, with at least 15 minutes of a window. I get here and the doors are locked. Of course I’m confused. I call, the phone and the line isn’t even ringing? I wait 5 minutes, 7:30 am rolls by and doors are now unlocked. My order isn’t ready even though 20 minutes have passed and I was told that it would still be a while because there was a catering order. If that’s the case, then my order shouldn’t have been accepted to begin with. And the bagel rack was empty so there wasn’t even a back up option. This is very annoying, especially when one has limited time before work. It would have been better to be told they can’t complete the order on the phone instead of showing up to this.<//text>

Our order was wrong. The tables inside and out were dirty. Especially disturbing with the danger of the covid19 virus. The lady behind the counter wore the same gloves helping customers and touching door handles and utensils. The cream container was empty and they were out of decaf and wouldn’t make anymore.  It was not busy so no excuse for the poor service.<//Text>

Very overpriced, and the place is dirty and poorly maintained. Wires hanging down the walls, cardboard boxes holding drinks in the displays (instead of unpacking and neatly arranging them), an array of what appears to be tablets charging in the display where I would think product would be displayed (again, with wires just sloppily dangling around)... I only went here, because it was close to the hospital where we just had our baby boy, and the wife was craving a bagel. Will definitely not return, and I would not recommend the place to anybody I know. Almost forgot to mention my latte tastes nothing like a latte. 👎<//text>

I've started going to Bagel Me on weekly dates with my grandma who says the bagels are better than the ones she used to get when she lived in New York. She likes the toasted bagel with lox, cream cheese, tomato and onion. She says the lox is top quality and fresh. We've been sharing the Super C OJ. It's like an orange Julius but better! Yummmmmmm!!<//text>< pictures>

I usually don’t write reviews, but I have to after the garbage that they call food was served. I ordered the veggie bagel sandwich. No where on the menu does it say that there is mayo on the sandwich, but surely enough the bagel was lathered with plenty of it. So much mayo it covered the outside of it as well. The sandwich is also advertised to come with avocado, but it came with about one sliver of it. Easily the worst “sandwich” I’ve ever had. It is also advertised to come with a side of bagel chips and applesauce. Let’s start with the bagel chips: Unsalted and terribly stale and it does even come with something to perhaps dip them in to help disguise the staleness. As for the apple sauce, it was basically 1oz of Cinnamon and sugar with apple flavoring. To top everything off, the wait for the food was about 20 min when I was THE ONLY PERSON IN LINE. Cost me a little over 11 dollars and hoping I can get my money back< /Review>

<Text>I absolutely love this animal clinic! Everyone is always so nice and caring. Dr Bell is great! I’ve been taking my Bella to ABC for 4 years and and they’re all so sweet to her. I wouldn’t go anywhere else, and their prices are great too, very affordable. Thank you Dr Bell, Roxi and Faith for your excellent service! And Gabriella, I wish you the best and congratulations!!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< UserId.>

We had to take my sons red eared slider turtle there because they were the only place we could find an exotic vet. They were able to get us in within a week and it was pretty reasonable.< /Review>

PRICE GOUGING AT IT'S BEST & VERY SPITEFULL!! This company preys on the love you have for your pet! I made an appointment for my dog with this vet over a month ago & they told me over the phone that it would be $95. When I get to my appointment they tell me that since I have a county spay/neuter voucher & voucher from a charity to help me pay for the visit I don't get the spay/neuter day price I have to pay full price of $105, plus I had to pay extra for my dogs pain medicine, antibiotics, I.V. fluids & a booster vaccine shot which added up to $171 after my vouchers. They called me & I missed the call so I called them back & they tell me my dog was in heat in which I know for a fact she was not, hence the reason I waited over a month for the appointment. So that is another $60 on top of the $171. I told them I cant afford to pay the extra money because my dog was not in heat the vet told that they would not give me they spay cert I was like that's fine. They also told me they will not give me my dog back. Then they call me back & tell me the vet said she would give me the spay cert but the vet will not give me my dogs medication (that I already paid for!) they told me again they would not give me my dog back; so if I don't pay the extra fee's they will keep my dog & not give me her medication & let her be in pain. I DO NOT RECOMMEND ABC ANIMAL HOSPITAL!!< /text>

<user_name>Donna Teixeira</user_name><Text>We had to put our beloved, family member “Bandit “ to sleep. The staff was very covid compliant, and under the circumstances treated us with compassion, and went up and beyond our expectations. The doctor was very sweet, understanding and compassionate towards not only our bandit but to our hearts as well. They gave us as much time needed to spend with our beloved, and even allowed us to take him home so we could burry him on our property.
I will recommend ABC Animal Hospital to all friends, neighbors and family members.
Even though it was a sad time in our lives, the staff and doctor made it a very pleasant experience.
Thank you and God bless you 🌈✝️🐶❤️🐶❤️< /Text><Time>1615307098487<//Time><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Gmap_id>0x80c47ca217a78565:0x317021f219698e95< /Gmap_id>< Rating>

Due to COVID-19 guidelines the vet technicians come out to your vehicle and collet your animals and take them inside to be seen by the veterinarians on staff. You must wait outside in your vehicle while they evaluate your animals and then a vet technician will come out to your vehicle with a diagnosis and an itemized estimate of cost of treatment and a recommendation as to the course of treatment for your animal. They are comparably priced with other local veterinarians and I have had generally good service and outcomes with my animals there.< /text>

I wouldn’t recommend anyone to go to this place. I only went because we bought a cat at the humane society and the contract they had with Barstow vet was up for getting the pets fixed. The new owner over prices for the animals to get fixed. Well long story short... you get what you paid for.. they did a chop job fixing my cat and once I needed help which they said I could call... they said due to Covid good luck! & go to another place any thought they fixed her Wednesday. She had an infection I caught early and her stitch job was awful. Thanks to Barstow animal hospital they came and saved the day before my cat could have died..< /Text>

Recent Visit and never had any problems before. My pets have been coming to this clinic for a few months now. I dropped my pet off for a simple routine gland and nail. I had to run an errand which ran late due to complications. They did call and I did explain that I was still waiting and would be there asap.

Upon return, I was greeted passive aggressively which someone tried to talk down to me instead of explaining the situation. I ignored the poor communication but listened only to the pertinent information being said. Others joined the communication, which deterred the person who was passive aggressive. In addition it seems rather peculiar that my dog now has to get sedated just for a nail trimming now when in past visits, this was not so. My dog is a service dog in training, which I told them on the first visit.

I do not expect them to know the commands, but I do expect them to treat my dog fairly.

As a Psychology Major, I would recommend alternate locations if you have other plans if only to drop your pet off for an appointment. They do not have the facilities to hold your animal if you are running late.

I will now seek alternate locations for the clinical needs of my pets.< /text>

They helped squeeze me in when my dog started to have problems walking. They did everything in their ability and, so far, she is recovering well. Thank you!< /Text>

She went for a spay and a week later she died

My sister just went last week and her dog is having problems healing from a neuter.
They took more money for testing and medicine and it’s not helping he’s bleeding now.
This vet should lose their damn licenses!

< Review>
My 9 Year Old Chihuahua had toxins in her liver which got into her bloodstream.. The Doctor said she had a 60/40 chance of pulling through so we were a little scared and stressed out but decided to take that chance.. And I am glad i took that chance, her treatment was a success! The nurses Krystal and Gabriella were awesome! They called periodically throughout her treatment to update us and made us feel comfortable to know that she was in good hands! Thank You ABC Hospital for taking care of my chihuahua and for giving her more years to be with our family!<//Review>

<Text>I needed my cat sedated, since she was not taking a long trip well, and also we had another 6 hour drive ahead of us. I called, then arrived at the office. Filled some forms, explained the situation. Asked how much is doctor visit and was told $25. This was ok with me. Half an hour later I was put in a room to see the doctor. 1 hour later the doctor arrived. She also said my cat will need an antibiotic for scratching too much from anxiety. Doctor prepared the sedative that was given to the cat. Then I see the antibiotic is a liquid that has strawberry taste. Who gives this taste to a cat. My cat is fighting with me any time I want to give it to her. Then the bill comes, and I am charged $35 for the visit. I asked the receptionist why she quoted me $25, and now charges $35. She told me this is the way, since I was a walk in. I did not have time to argue, had 6 more hours to drive, and this clinic took 2 hours of my time. Would not recommend< /Text>< pics>

We love ABC and everyone that work there! They always go over and beyond our expectations to do what is right not only for us but for our 3 babies aka dogs. Dr. Bell takes the time to listen to us because at the end of the day we know what behavior is normal for our babies. Thank you for everything you do to keep our babies happy and healthy!</Text>

Today I had to put down our family dog who had lived with us for 18 wonderful years. They were incredible. From handling calls from my mother who was absolutely broken and sobbing, and for immediately taking me And my amazing old dog into the back room so that I wasn’t standing in the waiting room losing it in front of everyone. They were so incredibly supportive through the whole ordeal and were the most amazing comfort to me and my dog. Today was hard, but the incredible staff here and their dedicated support was more than I could ever ask for. Thank you all for the amazing love you showed me today, you guys made the hardest day of my life a little easier and I love you all for it.< /text>

<Review>Gabrielle the receptionist is a outstanding employee and really compliments the whole experience. I own two Chihuahua mix puppies and they needed their rabies shots .She was very gentle with them and even the crybaby of the two didn't even wimper. I also found that ABC Animal Hospital is cheaper than some of the other veterinarian clinics in the area .
A thousand thumbs up to ABC Animal Hospital and their staff.< /Review><date>1551906919220< /date><Resp>None</Resp><UserId.>117012633745251553180<//UserId.><rate>5</rate>< pics>

<review>Had two of our female dogs in to be spayed this morning. Staff was kind considerate and knowledgeable. Where most facilities won't even see our dogs without a mussel the staff after a moment of caution encouraged me to remove the mussel for the dogs comfort. They seem to hold care and comfort of the animals as a priority, a refreshing quality anywhere let alone Barstow. As a side note they also seem to have the lowest prices in town a preferred trait for any buisness. We will be having all our animals seen here from now on.< /review>< pics>

<review>I took my strictly indoor cat in. She had blood in her urine and I was concerned. She's very skittish and anxious she loved everyone in the office right away! I've never seen her warm up to anyone so quickly. The staff is very informed and professional and the procedure even came out to less than I was quoted. I even got a call from the office the next day checking up on her. I have since suggested them to all the per owners I know in the area! ❤️</review>< pictures>

<Text>I came here to get a second opinion for my sick 15 day old puppy.  The first place I went wanted to do an unnecessary surgery on my poor puppy.  The doctor at ABC Animal Clinic knew what to do and was very caring and knowledgeable.  She cleaned out and drained the abscess on my puppy's neck and gave me antibiotics for him.  He has regained his strength and is back to eating.  That doctor is AMAZING!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><UserId.>109455181314136024190<//UserId.>< username>

Second visit was 2 hours for the same treatment. Both visits were by appointment. I find it extremely entertaining when I go through the trouble of making an appointment only to sit and watch walks ins get helped ahead of me. The staff is very nice but not very helpful. I know the same amount of information about the treatment my kitten got now as I did before the treatment.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Absolutely sloppy. The fill in so called doctor should have given my dog antibiotics... Long story. I had to take her to another real vet. I almost lost her. My lil fur baby was so sick. No decent place to park. Scurvy area. I didn't want to give it even one star, but I only did it to tell you all the horrible experience I had. Just disgust in that place.< /review>

I scheduled an appointment for my 3 month old holland lop rabbit to get nuetered the lady over the phone told me to fast my rabbit and to not even give him hay or water I knew immediately that I was not going to take my rabbit to this vet because any exotic veterinary should know you are not supposed to fast rabbits because they will go into GI stasis and get really sick and they could even die due to their digestive system shutting down I dont usually leave reviews especially negative ones but I just want to warn people to not take their rabbits to this vet</text>

Don't like it when you arent allowed to be with you pet during doctor visit. Will never go back there. Someone takes your pet back and you are paying for shots and examinations you dont know if they are even giving your pets. I like to be with them to make the trauma of getting the shots or even being handled by strangers. It is never the same person taking them in the back. Not my idea of a good vet or would i ever leave them for any type of treatment that i couldnt speak with the doctor.</Review>

We definitely understand your concern on making vaccinations less traumatizing by having their loved one there with them. We pulled your file and we see that you haven't been to our facility for a couple years. There are two other veterinary hospitals in town, could this have been somewhere else?

<review>I’ve never reviewed anything before. Honestly this place is a little sketchy. You can’t be with your pets as they are being examined. We took our yorkies here to get fixed and they completely botched the surgery. They came out with blood on them and even on their cones!! One of my yorkies had so much bruising and his incision looked horrible. My other yorkie’s incision came open within the hour of being picked up. We had to take them back and they just stapled him which worked. However, we ended up going to the clinic in Victorville for my yorkie with all the bruising. He was in pain for over a week and was going several days without peeing. When he would pee, he would scream in pain. After getting a second opinion we were told that the surgery was not done very well. (Apple valley animal clinic is incredible!) anyways they did laser treatment for bruising and some pain meds and he got better within about a week! Very horrible experience and way too much to go through just to get dogs fixed. We ended up having to spend more money to fix what they had done. :/</review>< userid>

The vet is rude and uses vulgar language at the customers. He's in it for the money! He doesn't care about the animals that need medical care. I don't know how he got his license to be a Vet! 🖓< /Text>

So I went yesterday to abc vet  to attend my dog that had parvo I kwew he had it so I went to get him treated for it. So then the next thing happens they tell me that the consultation was going to be 25 and laboratory service would be $48 dollars I only had $100 so I I said go ahead with the treatment and they told me that they were not gonna treat him unless I kept him there for observation meaning I would have to pay and additional $150 a night plus the treatment and they would see if he made it. Or leave him there and they would youthanize him. I ended up taking him to another vet where they treated him like an animal should be treated and I didn't even pay close to what these people were trying to charge me. So with that said this place is not worth taking your animals to!!!! If your passion is not about taking care or others then your job has no purpose.<//Text>

<review>Well let me start by saying  my husband an I travel all over the U.S.  for his work. And so have had to find a vet n many states.. I have a full blooded yellow lab, 4 years old. He still has his manly parts, as we thought of breeding at one time..but thinking he is a lab , so No way fixing his beauty and messing him up..He needed his shots updated and he has a hurt hip, he limps. So I make appointment with  this A B C Vet. Check in go set n room, girl comes n checks his temp. Leaves.. Dr vet comes n.... He ask me whats going on. I proceed to explain about his hip, an ask to have him look at it an exray.... NOT ONE TIME DID THIS VET TOUCH MY DOG.. He never looked at his leg,  hip, or do any touching [exam] Of my dog. No looking at his eyes, mouth , gums ,belly..NOT ANY THING !!! He sat as I talked and then told me he would have to put him under antesia or half asleep n order to get proper exray.. Which I did know that. But in same sentence he said since I have him under do u want me to nuiter him.. Omg ! What the heck, DO THEY THINK EVERY DOG SHOULD B FIXED, DO THEY THINK EVERY DOG OWNER WANTS TO FIX THEIR DOG. HE IS A FULL LAB. I SAID N A HARSH TONE , NO. DR GOT MAD. THIS IS MY DOG. And what part of this conversation makes him ask or think my 4 year old should b fixed ,....AND NOW..
WELL NEEDLESS TO SAY HE GOT UP, had his nurse come back n,  give me a estimate. But I lied an said I don't have the money now, but just give his updated shots.
This place didnt do a exam. Wanted to fix my dog. IDID NOT TRUST THEM AFTER THIS I FINISHED UP AN I AM NOT USING AGAIN. OR AT LEAST I HOPE NOT, I GUESS N A LIFE  OR DEATH SUTUATION , MAYB.. BUT I THINK THAT WOULD EVEN END BAD.. I did reveiws on other vets around , all had bad reviews. This one wasnt to bad n reviews . Any and every vet should look an do a hands on exam , even for shots.. That was the first bad sign to me... I couldnt trust them to do the best for my dog, an I think they'd of lied an fixed him anyway..and not give correct diagnoses on his hip. If he didnt touch it why bother... Very bad vet n my opinion. Others may like him but they have not... Many choices to choose from either...< /review>< Pictures>

This is the type of store you usually come with when you have two people just because you never know who may be behind your back. The people are not very friendly and of course how could they be with this kind of environment, but still it is not well kept and they mostly just sell alcohol, tobacco, and lottery tickets.< /review>

Employees kept yelling over each other. I didn’t know who was talking to me and I couldn’t understand them. They were raising their voices without speaking clearly. The shake wasn’t even full to the top. Very disorganized. I’m paying a premium price for a burger. I expect premium service.< /Review>

Here's my non-biased opinion. The burger is ok but doesn't add up to price. I went two times to make sure the first time wasn't a fluke. In the end, I feel it's just an overpriced unoriginal burger (Slightly above average taste even with all the fixings). I would say a meal (with fries & drink) is worth $10 there, but even at that price, I couldn't see myself searching this place out. It just isn't that unique. I paid upwards of $15 and was disappointed. Even Jack in the box puts a box around your burger, this place puts foil, that alone should tell you something.

I would opt for In & Out because the burger matches the value, but if i was going to shell out upwards to $15, I would opt for Bulldog Grill's burger, much better and more unique.

I would also take Red Robin over 5 guys because at the same price or less at least you get to be serviced. That's my take, I hope it helped you decide!< /Text>

Classic Five Guys. Very welcoming service, clean bathrooms, great food as always, and a nice patio outside to enjoy your food on sunny days.< /Text>

Online Ordering is pointless. I ordered online and selected pick-up ASAP, paid online. When I arrived and told them I was picking up an online order. They had not made the fries yet. They didn't put them in the fryer until I was there. Waited 10min to get my order because thier policy is not to cook the fries until I'm there. I understand the reasoning, because they want them fresh for the customer, but it defeats the purpose of ordering ahead. There is no comment or special instructions or box to select to let them know to have the entire order ready. Prices are over done. Two cheeseburgers and one fry and shake $37?!? Not worth it.< /Text>

I ordered a double cheese burger with the works and it was very satisfying and delicious. Will be going back soon for another. The staff is super friendly. I enjoyed eating inside and there was a nice atmosphere and the bonus free peanuts. I would recommened this place if you want a delicious juicy mouthwatering burger.< /Review>

< Review>
I always thought in-n-out was the best.  And, no disrespect, they are great.  However... My experience at 5 Guys was at a whole different level.
First, the"little burger" ain't little. It's very big. Bigger than most other places "giant" burger. Beware, because if you say "cheeseburger" you are getting the double, which is a mountain of meat.
And, by the way, the meat is so juicy and delicious.
Same thing for the fries. Cooked peanut oil, so very healthy. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The "Little Fries" are enough for 2. Trust me on this.
If you don't leave a huge fan, you accidentally went to Burger King.</Review>

<Review>They make a good lettuce wrap burger ( I can't eat a bun) and you know the fries are delicious and BIG. We enjoy the peanuts while we wait. I had never seen diet Mr Pib in a soda machine before ( but at the cost of having no Dr Pepper).  Back to the burger - usually a lettuce wrap there is hopeless to try to hold and eat (have to resort to fuel and knife, which works! ) but this time I could pick up and eat my lettuce wrap - thanks.< /Review>< Date>

First time at Five Guys... Last time at Five Guys... Okay, to be clear here the staff was as nice as possible, got greeted walking into the restaurant, got the friendly service explaining all of their options and menu set-up. Got an efficient order time. Everything with the staff and customer service was beyond what I can expect from this kind of restaurant so kudos to that staff here. On the other hand, I didn't think the burgers where all that great for the price I paid. Yes, you get all the toppings, but select few you have to pay for. Yes, you get free twice dip and triple salted peanuts to the power of 4(salted). Yes, free refills in their cool touch screen flavored drink machine. And that's about it. 3 stars for the awesome staff and customer service but for the price and burgers(1 combo, 1 sandwich), I didn't think it was worth it.<//Text>

<rate>5< /rate><text>The interior strongly resembles other 50's style diners but the food was a cut above. I had the double bacon cheeseburger, fries, and a soda. The fries were on par if not better than I've ever tasted. Little bit of potato skin remained with a medium cut giving them a weightier feel. But the burger was everything. All things fresh and juicy but the bun stood out the most. Held up well with all the previously mentioned freshness and still seemed to melt with every bite. They are a bit pricey though... no combos so there's no price break when combining items... but you're getting what you pay for...</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Not my favorite. You can build your own burger and select your toppings. Only one type of cheese. The fries which most people like are large orders and you can get with cajun seasoning.< /review>

My first time in any five guys so i needed a lil help deciding what to order.  The employee that took my order was very nice and helpful.  The food was good.  The restaurant was clean.  And whats most important was the service and that was very good.  I will definitely come back to this place.</Review>

Cared more about "fast" food. Burger was under cooked. Ordered Grilled Onions, but instead got near raw onions. Mushrooms were undercooked as well. For me and my husband it costed $28. Won't be coming here again. Just an overly expensive version of In n Out<//text>

Ok, this is my 5 Guys review. The burger was great. The Cajun fries were great. The staff is very friendly asking if we have been there before and explaining the menu. They do not have "combos" and the price is moderate. If you can deal with price tag, it is a great place for a burger.< /review>

First and last time we come here.  2 cheeseburgers with 2 fries and two drinks for $28.00.  Outrageous!  GO to in and out.  Same quality and possibly even better taste with out having to use your kids college fund.<//review>

<rate>5</rate><Text>It was the very best burger i have ever ever tasted. The fries are great. The burgers are had made patties. And not dried out. So juicy i thought it was gonna run down my chin every bite. And the cheese was just right. No greasy film in your mouth after eating the burger or fries. Fresh cut fries. Ate a 2 patty chesseburger. It is the best place around. Well worth the money. Probably worth more than they are charging for them. They give Peanuts away for free. Because they use peanut oil for their fries. Very very good. Almost better than sex. Sounds bad. But oh so good. Everyone must try this place.<//Text>< Pictures>

The service was great, everyone working there was really nice, the place was really clean but the food wasn’t worth the price. One thing was the bun of the burger was soggy and breaking apart, second my food was already cold by they time they gave it to me. I wouldn’t recommend going there. It’s not as good as everyone was bragging about it. The Cajun Fries also not worth it, there was too much seasoning and they were really salty.<//review>

A little too casual for the price. The fries aren't that great. Burger is awesome. They need chicken strips.< /Text>

<Review>The fries were just nasty don't know if it's the grease kind of knew there were Bland not very attractive. Hamburger wasn't nothing special just the same old hamburger. Their service was great the atmosphere was cold from the air conditioner. But other than that I wouldn't recommend it to anybody and I sure won't be going back it's the food and it's not the service cuz the people were excellent<//Review><Name>thereasa lee<//Name></record>
