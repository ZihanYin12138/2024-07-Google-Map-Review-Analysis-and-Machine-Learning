I signed up for
ONE on ONE Firearms'
Home Defense Shotgun Course.
I love that this was a small class. Joe Truesdale puts safety first in everything the class does. He is passionate and enthusiastic, very patient and makes it a point to spend One on One time with every student through every drill. He encourages questions and you can't help but leave feeling more confident. I went from not handling a shotgun in 20 yrs to understanding current gun laws, handling techniques and situational awareness.
Best of all...I had fun!!</text>

I just completed my first class with their team yesterday and they were fantastic! Joe, Ryan and Fred were all extremely knowledgeable and very helpful. They were also very patient and willing to take the time to teach. I highly recommend them for any level of training, from beginner to advanced.< /text>

I went for my CCW and their course is excellent! Sean & Joe are friendly to approach, ask any question, informative, and are enthusiastic to teach. After taking their course, I now fully understand what it truly means to have a CCW. I am planning to take their other courses they offer for firearms and shotgun training. I highly recommend people check them out for the CCW and other firearm courses.</Text>

<text>This is an awesome team. Even when someone makes a mistake (certainly including me), they have a way of respectfully correcting you. They are encouraging, fun, aware and extremely safety conscious.  These guys are truly the best. As an older woman, learning about firearms, these guys are amazing.

I’m so glad that a friend recommended me this company for firearms training. The class was interesting, fun, and very informative. I’ve been shooting guns for years but I learned so much that I can now use to enhance my skills. Sean did an amazing job in the classroom and was extremely knowledgeable on all of the content discussed. If you have a question, these guys will take the time to answer it. Joe and the other guys were phenomenal on the range. They spend the perfect amount of time so that people understand what to do.  I’m looking forward to taking more classes with these guys and they gained a loyal customer. Overall, a wonderful experience and a weekend well spent!<//Text>

<Text>If you want professional and safe firearms training, this is the place to go!  The instructors  are knowledgeable experts in competitive shooting techniques, but, without the pretentiousness that some “expert shooters” seem to have.  They will take a beginner willing to learn, up to advanced competition minded learners.  They are patient, fun, yet very professional.  I sent my mother there, and she loved it!  Got moms approval, hard to say more!< /Text><userid>118099534344930806160</userid><rate>5<//rate><Name>Jeffrey Morgan</Name><Response>None<//Response>< Pics>

Did I remember to say the training was fun?

<Text>The instructors for the Handgun Foundations class Joe, Ryan and Fred were all very professional, knowledgeable and approachable. Going into this class I had no experience with guns but wanted to learn, and the class served this purpose very well. The priority in was always safety and there it has a good balance of being informative and enjoyable.

The 8 hours is all quality instruction during which you learn to handle a gun safely, shoot effectively and even clean and maintain a gun. The pace was brisk for someone with no experience, but manageable, and the instructors tailor the level of attention you receive based on your learning needs.

For someone interested in shooting or owning a gun who doesn't have training, this class is invaluable. Most of the other students had some experience and were there to brush up on their shooting ability, and I can definitely see myself taking the class again for that purpose.< /Text><Name>Andrew Tarquinio</Name><Rating>5<//Rating><Response>{'time': 1518201598741, 'text': 'Thanks for the review Andrew!'}</Response><Gmap_id>0x809b1f2e58f42927:0x19619281ca3f9d0</Gmap_id>< Time>

Sean and Joe were very informative and entertaining in the classroom.  Fred, Ryan and Sean were very helpful and positive on the range.

I would highly recommend this class and other classes taught by One on One Firearems.  I will be taking a few more classes from them including rifle and shotgun.</review><pics>None< /pics>< user>

Always a pleasure to train with Joe and his team. I always learn something new and take away new skills. One on One prides themselves with a safe and knowledgeable environment.  Today they did not hesitate to eject an individual due to lack of safe handling. Bring your "A" game when training with them,  listen carefully to instructions and accept feedback from the pros and you will gain alot. Thank you Ryan for your one on one today in getting me requalified.<//text>

Just finished a CCW course with One on One and was very impressed.  I didn’t know anything about them initially, and picked them solely based on their google rating.  I’m glad I did.  All instructors were a wealth of knowledge, and took the time for solid instruction with each student.  If, and when, I get a chance to take another shooting class I will definately go back to One on One.  Highly recommend them to anyone looking for quality gun training regardless of initial skill level.<//Text>

<review>Took a CCW renewal course coupled with his "How to draw and fire from a holster" course out a Sac Valley Shooting Center.  Joe Truesdale was the instructor, and it was a great day of shooting and learning.  Joe has a great teaching style--demanding (ESPECIALLY with regard to safety), but patient.  He can cuss a blue streak, but never directed it at anybody, so he's not a drill instructor-type who gets in your face and shouts.  I am definitely going back to his crew for some further education, and I would recommend them to anyone in the Sacramento area.<//review>< pictures>

My son just finished his safety course with Joe and he is the complete package! His number one priority is safety, but his knowledge and enthusiasm are a close second.  Highly recommend One on One.

Had my first handgun training (foundations) on Saturday at the enormous Sacramento Valley Shooting Club facility. I want to say that this was such a safe,  informative,  and fun experience. I can't wait to go to the level 2 training. Sean, Fred, and Ryan spent so much time with the students it felt like a semi private session. I would highly recommend this course. There were so many different skill levels at this session it really surpised me. Many different skill levels from ccw students,  intermediate and of course myself (beginner). It was awesome to see my accuracy increase as the day went on. If you want top notch training, I would definitely recommend One on one Firearms. Don't hesitate, book your session now!

In the last two months I have trained with one on one firearms training in a private lesson and in a CCW training class these guys are nothing but constant professionals.
Their main goal is a safe environment for everyone to learn in their approach to teaching and their methods are top notch if you need firearms training one on one is the place you need to be.< /text>

< review>
I just completed my second CCW renewal class here at One on One Firearms.  Just like my first class two years ago, I paid the extra $25 for an additional 3 hours of drawing and shooting refresher instruction in the morning before the actual required 4-hour course.  Best $25 you can spend.  Joe Truesdale, the owner, is probably the best handgun instructor I have ever had, and I have had several.  His teaching methodology, not to mention his shooting skills, are second to none.  I have taken full weekend as well as week-long courses with other organizations, and I am an NRA certified handgun instructor myself, but Joe and his team are the BEST.  I must add that they are 100% safety-focused the entire time you are on or near the range.   This is a HUGE factor when selecting a training organization.  There were 10 of us on the firing line and three instructors to watch over everything.  Great Job...</review>

I just finished taking The 2 day Initial course at One on One Firearm with Joe. Extemely professional and knowledge. SAFETY is his top priority. He will kick a student out without hesitation if a student is careless with a firearm. You will definitely learn a lot with Joe.

Watch his youtube videos and practice his 5 step drawing techniques. If you have spare time before the course, go to the range and practice shooting at the 15 yard line.</review>

Joe is an amazing guy, with great teaching skills.

<text>I just completed by Carry Concealed Weapon (CCW) Renewal Class with One on One Firearms.  It was once again a GREAT experience,  took my initial CCW class with them.  I spent the morning on the range going over safe draw and firing procedures.  They really take the time to teach you safe and accurate methods to draw and fire your weapons.  The staff is experienced, fun and at the same time reminding us to practice safety at all times.  They are one of the few CCW schools that place emphasis on every aspect of carrying, drawing, firing and malfunctions.  My instructors of Ryan, Fred and Sean were experienced professionals, knowledgeable in the craft and made the day, fun, and most importantly safe.  In summary, if you are considering getting or renewing your CCW license I strongly urge you to consider One on One Firearms for your training needs!< /text><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

We went from basic gun training to now a more advance level of competition shooting.  We will never be world champions but I a sure you we are competitive.  Our goal is to achieve the next IDPA classifying class level, which is "Sharpshooter".  We take a semi-private lesson once a year as a refresher to remind us of the technical aspects of shooting in competition.  We get lazy on the "Dry Fire" practice at home.  We're senior competitors and we need to be reminded about our techniques at shooting and running a stage.  We also went through Joe's and Sean's CCW and renewal classes as well.  There are a lot of firearm training companies to choose from, BUT if you want the BEST give One on One Firearms a shout out to Joe, Sean, Fred, and their staff for all your CCW permitting and firearm training needs.<//review>< Rating>

I just completed my initial CCW 16 hour classes with Joe this Sat/Sun. I was referred to him by a friend. I was very impressed by his knowledge in all relevant legal areas, ability to answer all questions, interactive manner of lectures with appropriate audio-video presentations. Joe was very professional and respectful at all times while being highly entertaining.  Next day at the range, I noticed the importance given to safety and thoroughness of the preparation to use the range.  We all felt very safe. The ratio instructors/students at the range was amazing!  We each had an instructor at our side monitoring all our motions and keeping us safe.  4 students, 4 instructors, very personalized. Very high bench marks for safety and professional skills, all instructors are remarkable marksmen.  With their help I qualified with  both my hand guns.  All instructors, Joe, Sean, Fred and Ryan are extremely knowledgeable, professional, patient and respectful at all times. I went to 4 other  extensive multiple days training sessions at Front Sight, however, after completing One on One Firearms course, I can make the comparison that One on One Firearms is definitely superior and the customized instructions  second to none.
To summarize:
Safety 5 stars, law and all their implications 5 stars, Defensive tactics 5 stars, range instructions 5 stars, resources made available 5 stars. Instructor/ student ratio 5 stars. Punctuality 5 stars.  Overall course (2 days) value : 5 stars.
And think about it: you want the best training when your life or your family life may be on the line, therefore I find exceptional value in Joe's courses, excellent price/quality ratio.  --Horia< /text>

Just finished the Advanced Defensive Handgun course. This class reiterated the skills I had learned in other courses, and kept building on that foundation. I feel much better prepared and capable. The instructors, Joe Truesdal, Fred Mowrey, and Sean Young were extremely competent and patient. Even though we were performing advanced weapon manipulations and drills, it was a very safe environment. I would recommend One on One Firearms to any shooter, new or experienced.</text>

<Text>Just finished my CCW class at one on one firearms. I highly recommend anyone looking to get there ccw or renew their ccw or just looking for some great firearm training and handling.  Im fairly new to the firearm world and Joe took time to make sure everyone in the class followed and understood. A great resource for the community. The skills I learned will stay with me for life. Forget everything you think you know and go to One on One Firearms.﻿</Text>< resp>

This past weekend I attended the CCW initial training class ran by Joe and Sean.  The class was an incredible experience.  Very educational and enlightning. Joe takes his training seriously, but makes the experience fun and entertaining as you are learning serious concepts.  I was having an isue at the longer distance with accuracy.  Joe pulled me off to the side and gave one little tip for a hand exercise to do in between the rounds.  It made all the difference in the world I was stunned by the results.  His partner said to me that's why we cal him the "Gun Whisperer".  I personally call him the "Trigger Whisperer.  I listened to insight he was giving other students in the group and watched thier results also improve.  Joe and his staff really care that his students are sucessful and informed.  One of the outstanding things Joe and his staff are focused on is Safety.  Constantly reviewing saftey and insuring that environment is maintained throughout the training.  If you are looking to train for CCW or any other firearms training Joe and his team are the ones to choose!< /Text>

<Text>I've had my schnauzer mix groomed by Happy Spa Dogs a few times now.  He's had a different groomer each time, and everyone does a quick and outstanding job.  My dog isn't the friendliest, but the guys always manage to put him at ease (and even get a few tail wiggles out of him).

<review>My dogs always smell good after using Happy spa dogs and I've been to many other groomers ,so I can speak from experience. I've been inside the mobile
truck before to see how it's done and its very clean with good equipment that gives a thorough cleaning while the dog is kept comfortable. I would recommend them especially if your dog has anxiety about going to the groomer. You can be right there to calm them if need be.<//review><user_id>109797930455656750066</user_id><user_name>Amy Suchesk< /user_name><rating>5</rating></record>

<Text>We had disastrous experience with Happy Spa grooming ,first appointment was late on 45 min (they told me about delays 20 min before the actual appointment), I cancel and scheduled again
Not a single even place on our dogs body..they even cut our dog's eyelashes off so I wanted to cry !
After complaining no actions were taken from their side, I asked to refund and they said if they issue refund we can not be serviced by them again .. haha ! I would never ever ask for their services after such a terrible experience!

<date>1628275146983< /date><Rate>5</Rate><review>This is the first time I have used a mobile dog service.  I usually drive all the way to Riverside (I live in Laguna Niguel) to an actual place (I’m picky about groomers haha especially with all these tragic Petco incidents ), but it is currently closed for renovations, so I thought I’d try this. I gave them a 5 star rating because of their services (bath & grooming), which were excellent—love the bandanna. The groomer, Christen, was so polite, did a great job, and was quick, I really liked that.

However, I will say the scheduling is 3 out of 5 stars, because I was emailed, sent a text, & had been verbally told that my appointment was going to be at 7:30am, but when 8am came around I had to call about 2 times (no response, had to leave messages and no call backs), until my third call to them I was then notified that my appointment was at 9:15am. It would have been nice to have known of the change the day before not after having to call three times.

Overall, I would recommend this place and would use it again.</review>< Pics>

<text>Chris took great care of my baby, Greyson. He followed the pics of the haircut that I love. I know my little Maltese is very squirmy, but Chris made me feel like he did really well and was not a difficult dog! I love Happy Spa Dogs especially since they come to my house and are done in 45 minutes so that my dog doesn’t have to be around other dogs which make him very nervous! Highly recommend!! ❤️❤️< /text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

< review>
Our groomer this morning was actually a few minutes early which I love! We have three dogs all together one full breed pit one pitsky and Sadie who is a smaller mix breed. As I was trying to get out the front door with Sadie, the bigger girls got out first cuz they pushed past me. Thankfully our groomer wasn’t afraid of them and they just loved her and jumped on her like pet me pet me!!! I handed her Sadie and told her how I wanted Sadie cut and off they went. Shortly later she came back with Sadie with a bandanna around her neck and beautifully cut. Our groomer again was greeted by the big girls and our groomer had bandannas for them too. That was so sweet of her! Thanks for being suck a great sport with our big girls Samantha and thank you for sadie’s beautiful haircut today! Have a great day everyone! I will definitely be calling to make another appointment for Sadie!< /review>

My first time using Happy Spa Dogs and my dog was well taken care of by Connor! He came back looking fresh and clean with a cute bandana. This was my first time using a mobile grooming business and it was such a help since I work all day from home. Will be using this again!</text>

He's got a lot of bruises and is so anxious since the grooming. Never doing it with them again. See photos attached.

Absolutely no ownership from the happy spa dogs owners. No response to my phone calls, texts or Yelp reviews.

<text>Samantha did a wonderful job with my dog Bailey! It was convenient, good value, and for less than $100 I was able to get a lot of services that my dog needed. My dog is a rescue and she usually gets very anxious and nervous around people she hasn’t met, but it seemed as though Samantha was able to keep her calm and treat her the way I would want my dog to be treated. Will continue to schedule Samantha as needed!< /text>< Pictures>

<review>My two dogs needed grooming and one really hates  it. He has left twice from groomers without being cut.  Today was such a good experience. The groomer was wonderful with the dogs and both grooming came out great. I will only use happy dog spa from now on.< /review><name>Heather Gardea<//name>< user>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>Tried Happy Spa Grooming for my two golden retrievers, they had both dogs finished within 1 1/2 hours, both returned damp and smelling like wet dogs, also did not cut either dogs nails nor groom their paws. Super disappointing service for the prices they charge ($255.00) I let them know via email I was unhappy and they never bothered to respond. Will not use them again.< /Review>< user>

<Text>First, I had issues booking. I was told, over the phone, that my appointment was booked. Waited over an hour but no one showed up. I finally called and they claimed to have a record of my first call but no appointment. Luckily, they sent someone over to another location.

I was quoted $150 for my golden retriever, who is 50 pounds — I figured, like most places, they would adjust the price once they saw how small and easy my dog is.

My dog was done in 15 minutes— no haircut, just a bath. I was charged $150.< /Text><time>1621538911511</time></record></dataset><record>

I found this company on Google and liked them immediately. It's reliable they do good work and are pretty accommodating to your schedule no matter what day or time. It has been nice especially since the pandemic and I work from home. I would highly recommend using them as they are fast, reliable and nice you don't have to drop your dog off somewhere they come right to your home. They even dress your dog with a special bandana..<//text>

<Text>Absolutely loved this groomer! My dogs aren't always the easiest to deal with and they handled them with care and were able to give them the best haircuts that they have had in a while.  I have tried other mobile groomers and none of them compare! I will 100% use them again.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

First time client, the groomer was super nice and very fast. I have two rescues and they are hesitant and she was able to get  both done. One of my dogs has agression-scared of strangers issues and she managed the best she could but knew when to stop as well because of his challenges.  Greatly appreciate the professionalism.< /Review>

This was my first experience with mobile grooming. I'm totally sol on Happ Spa Dogs
On time, good communication, friendly staff. My guy was nervous at first but groomer, Lauraine, was calming. gentle yet in control in easing my guy to the mobile unit.
Really quality service. My guy looks fabulous!

<Text>Our normal groomer went out of business and I needed to find a trustworthy, reliable, caring replacement.  This team not only replied to my online inquiry in less than an hour, they took time to understand my needs and made the process easy.  On the day, the groomer pulled up, was wearing a mask when she knocked on the door, and greeted my dog like a friend.  She suggested a hypoallergenic shampoo when I mentioned itching, and assured me she would cleanup up my dog's "quarantine haircut" that we had tried ourselves!  Less than an hour later, my dog was back in the house, happy and clean.  SO happy we found this company!</Text>< Response>

<Text>Connor did an awesome job. We have an old dog 13.5 yr old Maltipoo who's eyes are failing him and his right paw hurts him a lot but, he walks fine. Makes it difficult for groomers cause he nips when law is messed with. However, "Prince" after being brought back to us went to say good bye to Connor. He's never done that with any other groomer! Connor is a keeper❤ Thank you Connor❣<//Text>< Gmap_id>

DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY! They did not show up for the appointment and I could not get a hold of anyone to find out the reason! Two days later I got a text from them to put a review fo them which I responded to! A few hours later I noticed a $95 charge on my credit card from the Happy Spa Dogs!
I imagine my surprise not only they didn't show up but they have charge my card for the service that hasn't been done!!!!!
How they find my credit card info is a mystery to me! Unless they hack my phone after I responded to their text!!!!<//Review>

I find it odd to see a lot of one star ratings and somehow they have an overall 4.8 rating. Do NOT be fooled by this company. Some cuts may be poor, but I’ve never encountered such horrible professionalism with a grooming company such as this one. I received texts and emails confirming my dog’s appointment. Not only are they a no show, but no responses. I should be able to charge them for my wasted time of canceling plans and having to wait around for them to show up.</Review>

Texted this place for an appointment for our Bichon.They refused service simply because I requested our dog not be blow dried. They said it would take too long to hand dry him and I told them no worries we would take him back damp and that we just mainly wanted him bathed and cut short. Very callous attitude I did not appreciate that.</Review>

I am not happy about Happy Days. I made an appointment. It was for 5:15 on Sunday.  They texted they would be here at 4:00 something. It was to be Monica. The girl that came was Elizabeth. She had my Shih Tzu for only a half hour.
Her hair was choppy. I asked for a close cut around her mouth. She didn't do it. The  hair around feet was all choppy. They didn't pull the hair out of her ears. I don't know what Elizabeth was doing for that half hour.
I was surprised they were coming on a Sunday but I needed my dog groomed.
First time to use Happy Days. It was no way worth it for outrageous price of $95.00. And they take your credit number on the phone, so you get charged right away,
I don't recommend Happy Days and won't ever use them again. They rip you off.<//text>

Unfortunately I cannot recommend this business. We had a great few experiences with our groomer the first several times. We have a Goldendoodle The last time the groomer insisted we shave down our dog completely due to tangles. We were hesitant but did it at their recommendation as best for the dog. We were fine with the decision. A few weeks later the groomer texted us to remind us of another groom. I said we were fine as the coat was still growing out. Imagine my surprise when I texted them a month later to to schedule a groom and they said:

“ hi based on previous grooms we can't give your dog the attention it needs. We feel you would be better off going directly to a grooming shop instead.”

I responded that I wasn’t sure why and asked for reasons and they simply stated:

“ Sorry about the confusion but we won't be grooming your dog anymore. Thank you for time”

They have a right to do business with whom they choose but I think it’s unprofessional to cut off services without a reason. And not sure why they solicited my business then just a few weeks prior.

Beware they may do this suddenly to you too. Will be taking my business elsewhere for sure.

Maybe they will see this review and finally state why. But be clear they didn’t want tell me why when I asked and I think it’s a shame they only would after I shared what happened.<//Review>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Used this service for my senior dog a few times now. Very happy with how easy it is to set up the mobile appointment, and how professional the entire staff is from start to finish! Most importantly, I am so impressed with my pup's assigned groomer, Kimberly! A true dog-whisperer, she calmly and carefully bathed and groomed my often-anxious pup. He returned in about an hour looking stellar and wearing a cute bandana for the holiday! Highly recommend!<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Ash was my groomer and I couldn't be more impressed. He showed up early and worked quickly but efficiently. I was impressed with how clean my pup had come out of the van. Ash has convinced me to become a continued customer and I highly recommend this service.</text>

I am so happy I found Michelle H. at Happy Spa. Mobile grooming is the way to go! Pull up in a nice clean grooming van . With  bad experiences at 2 salon where my 5lb maltipoo had been traumatized, I could not be happier!
After only 40 minutes my Bonnie came back with exactly the cut I asked for! She looks adorable!
She has more poodle and Michelle definitely knows poodle cuts where alot of groomers do not.
I highly recommend Happy Spa Dogs Mobile grooming! FYI - There are w Michelle's that work there. Michelle H. is the one that did my Bonnie< /text>

My groomer Elizabeth was excellent with my Corgi. She is so very sweet, kind and gentle with him. His toenails have never been cut better. I got THE BEST sanitary cut! Elizabeth got all of the fluffy rear hair that catches poop trimmed so perfectly that it not only looks fabulous but will solve that problem. I am beyond impressed with Elizabeth’s skills in shaping the trim and handling my dog. She is also a rare gem with a huge heart that is hard to find these days. You will be so grateful and happy with Elizabeth. The price is definitely worth the results!</Review>

I’ve used Happy Spa Dogs for a year & realize most non mobile spas are around the same price & your dog suffers in cages for hours until his or her turn.

<Rating>2< /Rating><text>At 8AM was told via text that My appointment that was at 11:30 was changed to 10:30. Then at 8:45am was told via text  they would be coming in 15 minutes. No one showed. Called in at 10am after texting back asking for an update with no reply and received there voicemail. I received a call back pretty quick and seemed like they were confusing me with another appointment but after sorting that I  asked about what was going on and was told I refused the groomer at my door when really no one called or showed up. After back and forth confirming my address I was told they are still in the area and will still come after they finish the appointment they were on. Then was told they would be here in 20 minutes. Grooming went well but everything leading up was bad and on top of it if I hadn’t called who knows if I would have had my dog groomed at all.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<text>Vicki was great. Quick and responsive and very complimentary of my hyper, big, goofy puppy, my high strung little house manager, and my special needs territorial dog who has caused me all kinds of stress throughout his life. My pack is not an easy one to work with, but Vicki handled them with care and understanding and pretended she didn't notice that they're all "a little special"!!< /text>< pictures>

About 20 to 30 mins later they were "done" which on average it takes about an hour.  My dog is 5 years old and I've never had a groomer (mobile or store) finish within 45 mins.  They also didn't tell me a price then since get a text saying it was 100$.

<text>We asked multiple times to please not cut our dogs hair. We have a Spinone Italiano and they need a specific grooming called “stripping the hair” after a certain age. I spoke with the schedule and my husband spoke with the groomer before the appointment started to make sure we were clear. At the end of the appointment the groomer presents us with our pup whose hair was cut on his face!!! WHAT!! We asked the groomer why and she said SHE WANTED TO. Also, she shaved his belly and there were multiple cuts. We have reach out to the business multiple times through phone calls and emails (with attached pictures) only to have Brett say he will get back to us and never did. It’s been over a week now.... This is a very unprofessional business that completely disregarded their customers wishes and concerns. Don’t use them.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80dce9131b1c3d19:0xbab90ff693464c5e</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Made an appointment excited to try the service and find a local mobile provider for my newly adopted dog. Never showed up no call and no answer to first call and voicemail left that day. Had to call again the next day to get a call back. Turned out I didn't get added to the schedule. It may be have been a simple one time mistake human error everyone makes. But a first impression is the most important with a new customer. Had i been a regular I could have let it go. I may have had they offered a break of any kind as an apology to make right but i was only offered a new appointment.</text><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80dce9131b1c3d19:0xbab90ff693464c5e< /gmapID></record>

<Text>I have always liked the company. Very convenient and great service... BUT! Today I had Vicky and because of her I absolutely love this company. She was early which I love and she had a very fun and welcoming personality. My dogs took her to her with out hassle. When I received my dogs my heart melted. The looked so cute and smelled so fresh. And the cherry to the ice cream for me was the cute bandana for my little boy and the perfect place bow placed on my little girl. Usually she hates them but this one she is ok with being on her head and I’m loving it. Perfect experience!<//Text><user_name>Donaven Dukes< /user_name><response>None</response>< pictures>

<review>We love Happy Spa Dogs Mobile Grooming! First, they are great with both of our dogs. Everyone is super sweet, they have the best little gift shop and are constantly giving freebies. I have referred a ton of people to Happy Spa Dogs Mobile Grooming, whether for cuts or for a little birthday treat for their doggo. My girls love Happy Spa Dogs Mobile Grooming.<//review>< rate>

Not only do they provide exceptional service. The other thing I know for sure, they hire the best groomers in the industry. Which also speaks volumes about the owners of this company. Our groomer today was Angela, honestly I now call her the dog whisperer. I've never in my dogs 16 years of life have ever seen my dog so happy to get her hair cut.  Angela without a doubt did an amazing job. You can rest assured, I will ask for her again. Thank you Happy Spa Dogs you guys deliver like no other. You're truly second to NONE.<//text>< Time>

<Date>1595962600637</Date><rating>4< /rating><Review>I enjoy using happy spa dogs mobile grooming to get my beautiful 8 year old American Bulldog all nice and clean. We’ve had them bathing Cain for about the past two or three years and they do a very in depth cleaning of my baby boy each time. The girls that have come to bathe Cain each time have been very sweet and treat my dog as if he was one of their own! Anytime I have a specific request for his bath I’m greeted with a smile and we discuss the specific issue that I feel needs to be addressed. Also, how can you beat the comfort of having your dog bathed in your driveway on such a professional level for an affordable price? You can’t, unless you use Happy Spa Dogs Mobile Grooming!< /Review>< Pics>

I was so anxious and nervous to get my little man groomed for the first time , he’s 6 months old and wanted it to be a good experience. I contacted happy spa dogs and got my little yorkie a appointment. Keala was so amazing with him as he can be a little fussy but she said he did great except for trimming his face ! I was so happy with how she treated my lil guy. He was very matted because I couldn’t get him groomed due to his shots not being done , I tried to brush him daily but still he got matted all over his body , we had to cut his hair short as they couldn’t brush out the mats but now that it’s done I can just get him groomed every couple months and his hair can be longer. Again, really happy with keala & happy spa dogs and my anxiety is gone now after seeing how good keala was with my boy Jaxson. Will be using them again and will be requesting keala from now on !<//review>

Have used Happy Spa Dogs twice now.  The professionalism, response time and care for my pup is 5 star!  You get a call when they arrive, I have had Adriana and love her, they are masked up and my little furry friend looks amazing.  Best groom I’ve had in the area and we’ve been at it for over 12 years now.  Thank you Happy Spa Dogs!< /text>

<Review>My pup hates going to the groomers- being caged for a couple hours with a bunch of anxious dogs! Happy dogs mobile groomers has changed my Oliver! He is happy when he goes and and happy when he comes out.  The groomers are efficient, kind, clean, and listen to your requests.  What a relief to have this service :-)</Review><rate>5< /rate>< pictures>

<review>This is a waste of money. They returned my dog basically smelling and looking the same. They did it in less than 15 minutes. I called to see if I can get a refund or if someone can come do a better job and all I got was attitude and they never called back. I basically paid 105 dollars for a bandana they put on my pup. Worst experience/service ever!</review><userid>106552433751177561907</userid>< GmapID>

<review>We have been using Happy Spa Dogs for our grooming needs for over a year and they have been nothing but the best. We have two mini goldendoodles and each time, the cut and groom leaves them shiny, smelling sweet and happy! Each groomer we have worked with has been super sweet and great with our dogs, and they have always been on time, great communicators, and quick - both girls are done in an hour flat! They are worth every penny and scheduling with Chris is always easy and quick via text. I recommend them to everyone who needs a great groomer!<//review>< pictures>

I called Happy Spa Mobile Grooming and they came out the same day.  My puppy loved Lorraine!  (We've had problems with biting when using other groomers.)  Lorraine came early (yay) and did a great job.  He looks so handsome now!!</Review>

I used this groomer for the first time last week, I have a very anxious dog and he had a terrific experience. Connor came to groom my old English bulldog and I couldn’t be happier with their service overall. After he got groomed they sent my Bubba a treat in the mail!</text>

<user>112849117409098797856< /user>< Review>
I booked an 8:45 am grooming appointment for our two english bulldogs and the groomer Keala showed up a little early. This is the end of the positives.

My poor boys were so roughly handled and groomed that I feel bad for putting them through it. One of their eyes was washed and scrubbed so hard that the skin around it was bleeding. Also the nail job was one of the worst I have ever seen. I know bulldogs have thick nails that can be hard to handle but excuse me for thinking dog groomers would be able to work around that. Keeping it short on the nails they were jagged, bleeding, and still had pieces hanging off. I will let the pictures do the talking.

The entire ordeal felt rushed as the groomer received the dogs at around 8:40 and was completely done with both by ~9:05. So 25 minutes for 2 bulldogs to be washed, clipped nails, ears done, groomed, and blow dried. I admit I am no groomer but that does seem a bit fast to me.

I have contacted Brett who I booked the appointment through in hopes of figuring out why this occurred and making sure it doesn't happen again.

Will update review upon further communication.< /Review>

Was extremely disturbed by the rude behavior by Chris (maybe the owner).  I had booked the day before with Jade, and had to cancel, so sent an email and text the same day as booking to cancel.  I was never informed of a cancellation policy when booking. They didn't read the email, and the next morning the groomer texted that they were on their way.  I immediately spoke with the groomer, saying I had cancelled.  In speaking with her, she said no problem, things happen, and she hadn't left yet.  BTW, I wasn't taking a spot someone else would have booked, they were WIDE OPEN on times, same day and next day.  Then came the angry phone call from the owner, Chris, saying they were charging me the $125 (VERY pricey for a bath only) whether the groomer came or not.  The level of anger made me think I was thankful I didn't entrust my pup to this company.<//Review>

They showed up on time (730am on sunday!) And Lucy, my dog , fell in love! She is super picky normally, but we had no problem getting her to go for her haircut.
They did an amazing job. She has never been softer! Loved the experience and will definitely use them again.</Review>

< review>
We used them for the first time for two small dogs. My 10 year old Teddy Bear got a full groom, and her haircut looks great. My parent’s elderly Shi-Poo got a bath. Both were very happy and had a good experience. The price was the same as I normally pay, but the convenience of having them in the driveway was wonderful. The groomer came on time, wearing a mask and was very good with the dogs.<//review>

I changed my rating to five stars from four for two reasons: Marci was amazing in every way. Our dog seems to love her and her cut was spot on!

I did try to check out other mobile grooming services but this one is by far the most reliable, efficient and painless service. Totally worth the extra few bucks you pay. Thanks Chris and Marci!< /review>

I contacted Happy Spa Dogs after I tried taking my dog to a groomer, but wasn’t able to get him groomed because he started experiencing major anxiety after they took him to the back. He’s never reacted like that before so I was really worried and thought this would be a better option for him. I was right. The groomer did a fantastic job with my squirmy 99lb lab. She got him cleaned up pretty quickly and my dog came back happy and anxiety free.</review>

Happy Spa did a great job with my dog.  I was able to get an appointment in a couple of days, they were right on time.  The groomer was great with my dog and she looks amazing.  It was fast too.  Super happy with their service and will use them again.</text>

Adriana did an amazing job on my doggy, due to the quarantine he hadn’t gotten a haircut in a long time and was pretty matted. She did an amazing job, and left him looking super nice and clean. I would definitely recommend, especially during these tough times.< /review>

This was my Bernese Mountain dog's first mobile grooming experience so he was very hesitant to get in the van. Keala was very calm and patient with him, he came out very happy and so fluffy! Thank you!< /Text>

I was able to get an appointment quickly, which was very nice considering my toy poodle was 6 weeks overdue for her regular grooming.  Groomer was on time, interacted very well with my 13 year old baby.  She even made a suggestion about length due to her matting.  I will be booking with them again!<//review>

My rescue pup had his first grooming with Konner. Very happy with the service. Making appointment was easy, I got an appointment for the next day. Konner came on time and the grooming process was fast (less than an hour).
Highly recommended!< /review>

Angela was so gentle with my big guy and after 45 minutes she was done as promised. His nails and ears look great, he’s soft and smells beautiful. The van was very clean! I definitely recommend Angela and thank you Chris for explaining your services and fitting Reggie in last minute. It was never about the money which is refreshing

I watch dogs and will definitely tell my clients and friends!!!

12/26/2019 - this is my second time using Happy Spa Dogs and they are awesome. They’re very friendly, communicate well, on time and very gentle with my older oversized lab. I definitely will be using them again!

<Review>Not impressed.  Our washer fiinished  "full service" appointments on both of my 2 pugs in under 30 minutes flat. That would mean he only spent 15 minuteson each dog.  There is no way someone would be able to thoroughly wash, dry, brush, trim nails, clean wrinkles and ears, brush teeth AND perform gland expressions on a dog all in 15 minutes. Just shows the quality of service... dont get me wrong, the dogs were clean but you could tell he rushed through it as quickly as he possibly could. Expected better.</Review>< user_name>

First time using Happy Spa Dog Mobile Grooming.
We had a matted and dirty Cavalier KCS that hadn’t been to the groomer for months due to Covid.  Adriana was very nice and did an beautiful job cleaning and grooming our dog.  I will make Happy Spa Dog our one and only grooming company. Ask for Adriana-she does a great job!<//text>

Yesterday was our first experience with Happy Spa Dogs, specifically Lauren groomed our labradoodle! I can't say enough how wonderful our experience was- the cut and grooming looked wonderful and she was extremely fast and professional! Thank you for making our first mobile experience so great!< /text>

Absolutely amazing. Always on time. Actually ahead of time which makes the life so much easier. I had to leave my puppies all day at a grooming shop and was such an inconvenience. Happy Spa comes to your doorstep and are done within an hour max. It’s such a relief. And Jennifer is the sweetest and treats my dogs like her own. I have been recommending them to all my friends and family who owns dogs.  You have to try them to see what I mean. It’ll be worth every penny I promise. Thanks to Chris and Jennifer for being awesome.</review>

The appointment was easy to set, groomer was on time and very nice, and my dog looks great! The price is higher than other mobile groomers, but the service was fantastic and, for me, that service is worth the added expense. Thanks again!<//Text>

OMG. I have never used a mobile groomer before today and I’m telling you it was the best experience I have ever had with groomer. I just got a bath for my dog and 15 minutes later she wash clean and back in house so happy. Love Spa Dogs. Never going back to indoor (not naming names) groomer again.< /Review>

I sent Breanna photos of the desired service -  photo 1 & 2, we agreed to cut him shorter as she said they were only allowed to do summer cuts on my type of dog, and I said to just keep his face the same as the photo I sent her. She did not have to shave my dogs ears and she could have spent some time on his face instead of chopping up his face for $160.00! His ears were not matted!  I would not recommend this service!  I did not get any response from her either after trying to contact her.< /text>

Friendly and easy booking process. Chris was fantastic, and was able to get us in with an appointment with only a few days' notice. It is pricier than going direct to the groomer, but I thought it would be worth it. I had a first thing 8 am appointment, and was caught a little off-guard when our doorbell and phone (didn't leave a vm) was ringing at 740 am - a little too early to be ready for the appointment. My dog's haircut wasn't the best around her face. I had to go back and do extra trimming myself to even it out; especially around her ears which were left one longer than the other and with straggly bits. I'm not sure I can justify the near double price for a less than excellent experience.<//text>

<Review>Very happy with the services.  My elderly dog was calm and happy when she returned from grooming and wasn’t distressed in the least which hasn’t been my experience with other groomers.   She looked great and the pricing is very reasonable.  I will definitely use them again.</Review>< user_id>

I scheduled the apptmnt the same day and my Groomer was early and super nice!  They are on the more expensive side of a wash and cut, but just hate the thought of my 16 yo pup locked up in a cage for 4 hours just for a simple thing.  I would recommend this company to anyone looking to have the groomer come to you.<//Review>

Love the service too as it’s a standing appointment so I don’t have to think about booking her an appointment and the reminders they give are amazing too.

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>This grooming service is absolutely amazing! Jen is such a sweet person and I felt super comfortable trusting her with my dogs! My two puppies came home adorable and smelled wonderful! The time that it took was also just as they promised! Will for sure recommend to anyone who’s busy and looking for something affordable.<//Review>< Resp>

I was new to the mobile grooming service. I didn't think that it was that big of a deal because I had a small short hair dog. But wow it is so nice that they come they love my for baby and make the bathing experience very comfortable for him. Jennifer is awesome and Chris is on top of it. Something else I don't have to worry about thanks guys.</Text>

We pride ourselves in exceeding our clients expectations and it appears we haven't with you. I am sorry the van didn't meet your expectations. It is brand new - I think under 7,000 miles on it. Yes - your dog was very matted. Please, please, please don't let your dog get matted. You can avoid matting by either servicing him more frequently and/or brushing at home.

<Review>This was my favorite Dog Groomer until today. I had to cancel less than 24 hours because of my dog being at the emergency vet which she passed away. Chris the owner,  was rude and still charged me for tomorrow's visit. He sent really unprofessional texts, his communication skills  need improvement, and I am looking elsewhere for grooming for my other dog.< /Review>< gmapID>

I have a 14 year old Bichon poodle and she's not a fan of getting groomed. Jennifer from Happy spa showed up and cuddled her and made her feel comfortable. She did an amazing job on a dog who had gotten matted up because of the rains. We are thrilled at her haircut and the results. I can't believe how quick she had her done and back in her our house. I will definitely refer Happy Spa out to anyone looking for a Mobile groomer!</text>

So glad that Happy Spa Dogs is open and still able to pamper my pooch. Breann always makes our little Bella feel safe and leaves her beautiful and smelling lovely. I highly recommend their services!< /Text>

Buster LOVED his bath and groom with Jenn. I've taken him to brick and motor locations before and we have had mixed experiences. Jenn arrived on time and got started right away on grooming Buster. She was fast and thorough and we've never seen him so clean or beautiful! They told me on the phone thatHappy Spa Dogs would be the best grooming experience for me and my dog and they were right! We will be using this company for all of Busters future grooms!<//review>

Jennifer was on time, friendly and great with our boarder collie. As hyper as most bearding dogs are, ours make the standard look lackadaisical.
Sophie looked and smelled very good. Her fur was nicely trimmed.
We are Lo oking forward to Sophie’s recurring appointments   Without having to take her anywhere.
Sophie is looking forward to sitting for Jennifer.<//Review>

Kim was so great with our dogs I have an 11 year old German Shepherd and a 3 year old, both with different temperaments and she handled them very well they were so pretty and soft when she was done with them and she spent a lot of time with them. We will definately use Happy Spa again and we will ask for Kim!</review>

Great service. Jennifer was on time and took very good care of our Mozie Girl.
She looks and feels  great. If you're searching for a mobile groomer, this is the one! Thanks.</Review>

<Review>First time using Happy SPA Grooming. Excellent job done by Angela.
My dog is 15 years old and Petco and Petsmart would no longer groom or bath him due to his warts. Angela was very kind and did a great job.

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>I wish all of the businesses I use would incorporate the business model of Happy Spa Dogs! Their communication is amazing. They are not only prompt, but a little early. Jennifer loves the pets and is so efficient with her grooming. She treats my 11 year old Shih Tzu and my fat Calico cat with such love. After experiencing Happy Spa Dogs there is no way I would be as happy with any other mobile grooming service in South OC.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80dce9131b1c3d19:0xbab90ff693464c5e< /GmapID></record>

<review>This place is located at the Soco Mix. Their drinks are pretty amazing. You can order on the iPad or directly with the cashier. I’ve been here a few times and their drinks never disappoint. If you’re here to hang out with friends or study/work on a laptop give this place a visit.<//review>< Time>

I love that they have cold brew on tap. So cool. What a great spot. Gorgeous open space, friendly crew. And most of all, they are passionate about their product. Really neat guys. I wish they would have more rustic cookies and desserts rather than french pastry type stuff but that is my only thing. I will excitedly come here every time I am in Orange County,CA.<//Text>

I've been to a few of them now, I think I can safely say that Sunright Tea Studio is definitely top tier in milk tea - this one was no exception! This one is in the middle of a indoor food plaza, so it might be a bit hard to find - just look for people waiting around for their drinks :D. Their milk tea and their Boca are both very good! Unfortunately I live in LA so I won't be able to visit this location as much, but it's good to know that Costa Mesa has an excellent milk tea spot if I'm in the area!</review>

Great boba place with good quality real taro. Their fruit teas don’t taste too artificial either. I recommend 70% sweetness for all drinks.</Review>

Really cool place, good tea, and FINALLY a place with Celyon tea, kind staff. Gotta sadly rate it 3 stars as the boba is really hard and not fresh. While the Creme Brulee topping is mainly sugar (not like other places). Low quality for what you are paying.<//Text>

one of my most fav boba places. They ppl there are literally so sweet, and their drinks aren't that expensive. They have all my fav teas and they make them perfectly. 10/10 would recommend they are pretty epic ✨< /Text>

I have to admit that when I first pulled up and saw the front of this coffee spot I was unimpressed ... I was even more unimpressed by the lack of parking in front of the venue and behind in the alley. But I searched this place out on google and agreed to meet a friend here to study so there was no turning back.<//Text>

Nice servers just their taro was literally the worst taro I've ever had. It was sandy and covered in honey. I tried explaining it to them but they didn't understand and wouldnt offer either a change in drink or refund without paying. Super disgusting....< /text>

Great place..
it’s best with no sugar or 25% or less. I never liked whatever “sweets” they used. It made whatever good drink they had, bad.<//Text>

(Current COVID-19 review)

So far I've been here quite a few times already. The drinks here are pretty consistent and they offer delivery and online ordering.  My constant go to drink is their Sunright Boba Milk Tea, the balance Of sweet and tea is excellent and when my gf came with me to try a fruit tea she said it was really good and their strawberry tea can rival Omomo. Lines here are usually short and workers here try to push drinks out fast, I do recommend 75% sugar since their milk tea drink can lean to be very sweet so 75% is good also ice level there is no need to adjust they don't put too much ice. I recommend this place, they do offer seating but it's closed currently due to COVID-19, and it's inside the OC mix next to Portolo Coffee. Happy boba drinking. They don't offer physical stamp cards but you can sign up for a rewards points on their iPad on the register and it'll link your card to your account, to later earn points for drinks!</text>

<Review>Sunright fruit tea 50% sugar with honey boba.... The cashier recommended 75% sweetness but at half it's still too sweet... Honey boba didn't taste fresh not sweet. Drink itself wasn't as refreshing I thought it'd be.

I ordered oreo brulee w boba milktea and sunright milktea. I can barely taste the brulee in the first drink. The sunright milktea taste like milktea :) oh, it's not too sweet and the price is acceptable to me.< /Review>

There was a long line when we went one weekday evening but it moved pretty fast.  The service is friendly and efficient.  I was skeptical about the ice cream because I hadn't tried Handel's before but I enjoyed it.  Good consistency, great flavor, and a good amount of chips, swirl, etc mixed in to the flavors. I don't know about "world's best" but it is pretty good and not too expensive.</Text>

If the line is long (this happens even on cold days) and you haven't ordered ahead, be prepared to wait! The ice cream is a bit pricey, but the ingredients are high-quality, the flavors are plentiful and imaginative, and most importantly it is delicious!

If you like milkshakes, here's a tip: never get a regular milkshake from Handel's, and instead always get an "extra thick" shake. A regular milkshake is so thin, it's like flavored milk. An extra thick shake is like a regular shake from any other restaurant. Lastly, a pet peeve of mine is that they simply don't have drink carriers. If you are buying multiple milkshakes to go, you'll have to make multiple trips to your car, only carrying what you can safely hold in your hands. This is problematic if you have a toddler with you!<//Text>

<review>My first time here, so I got the sampler for $6. That’s quite a deal for 4 scoops of premium ice cream.

My favorite so far is the black cherry. The chocolate peanut butter was good too.

The salty caramel truffle was ok, but disappointing. And the vanilla brownie was so-so.

I will definitely be back to try some more new flavors!</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMoLFGPs04oJxZXTC6_EQ1Xxs6ua3kilsMn_GGp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPSCi1Lb6J886vqJrtjiE3Gv18AbVd7AfIDZE5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><user_id>112844905495744375111< /user_id>< Time>

Yum!! The nice cream is absolutely delicious. I’m super picky about my ice creams. I have favorites within certain brands and have tried just about every ice cream shop throughout California. If you enjoy fresh-tasting, creamy textured ice creams, you will really appreciate their ice creams. I have tried the strawberry cheesecake and the mud pie. Both were great. The strawberry cheesecake had a nice strawberry flavor and there were chunks of some sort of crust-like pieces. The mud pie had a strong coffee flavor, which worked beautifully with the chocolate and marshmallow ribbons. It also had an Oreo cookie crumble (or something like that). And bother were equally creamy. I would recommend giving their ice creams a try.</Review>

This was pretty good. It was definitely pretty big. The  service was friendly and helpful. The flavors were above average and the price was reasonable. WE'll be back to try more flavors next time we're in town.</review>

<review>Very delicious ice cream. Creamy and a bit stretchy which is a sign for me that the ice cream is legit. The best deal on the menu is the 4 scoop sampler in my opinion. Would have rated five stars, but the prices are a bit on the expensive side. One scoop is at least 4 bucks. I would recommemd though for the quality and the atmosphere.</review><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1619407157930, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your honedt review!

<date>1610761095776< /date><review>Worth the trip for really good ice cream. They have a variety of flavors and if you get a banana split, you're able to switch out the flavors for your own. Also ordered a chocolate banana but they're pre frozen not fresh dipped.  Staff is friendly and the environment is clean. They have all their social distancing precautions in place such as markers on the floor for the line and outside seating.</review><Rating>5</Rating>< Gmap_id>

We tried 4 flavors. It is less than what we expected,even less than the  icecream we buy from grocery stores. From all we heard, we expected something better. Over all very disappointing.</text>

<Text>First time here. The flavors offered are extensive, the person taking my order was very helpful and made great suggestions. The 'single' size was more than plenty (they also explained this to me). Was a very happy customer.

I wasn't expecting this ice cream to be that special, but wow it's really on another level. We pick up a quart to take home every chance we get now. So far the cherry magnolia and the monkey bussiness are our favorite flavors.</text>

< review>
Prices are very high; it reminds me of when Tillamook came out with ice cream and thought charging 15.99 for a half-gallon would make consumers think it would taste better because of the low price.
Nothing special here, cream and milk! Yippee. This charming younger Asain teenager was working there who turned it all around and was very nice enough to make me smile.so I guess maybe it's worth the extra 10 dollars for a heavier cream? See for yourself!< /review>

Great place to grab some ice cream after dinner. They give a ton of ice cream for the single scoop so be ready for it. My kids loved the blue monster, Im a huge fan of the cookie dough as the ice cream was so smooth. 5 stars for sure, enjoy!< /review>

This is a ethnicity diverse store. Customers, Employees, and Brand products. But also products from popular grocery store chains. A really beautiful store. A fresh bakery making fresh breads, another one making cakes, cookies and pastries, meat counter, a deli counter, all very busy everytime I went in the store was buzzing. Check it out you will be pleasantly surprised. They also have a medium size restaurant where you could grab a table on the patio. That review coming soon.< /Text>

Their vegetable are fresh and almost always priced competitively. They occasionally would put their Walnuts and Almonds at half price(watch their ads). We always stop by and check every time where in the area.</Text>

<Text>Now they changed the management which is much better more organized I see alot of Indians which you might think the new owner is Indian. But I don't think the prices will go much higher!!. I saw less deals on the vegetables and the fruits sections and less deals in general, some of the shelves were also changed totally.

A new Arabic sweet which I think owned by Iranian family is opened which is so yummy, you got to try their Iranian Baklava.  I buy it ready packed from different store . But I don't know how much it costs in there.  Overall much better but might be more expensive.<//Text><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

Very clean, prices are lower than most of the supermarkets. Meet service is great, mostly Hispanic butchers and counter personal. Very patient and friendly response to your questions.< /Review>

By far the worst place to order food. Yes, the food tastes ok, but they will tell you "Your order will be ready in 15 minutes", you come back after 15 minutes and they haven't even started on it yet, and had you not reminded them, they would forget all about it. So you wait another 15 minutes, and they'll tell you with attitude "We're busy", and then another 15 minutes, (a total of 45 minutes), you'll get your food either without a bag, or everything thrown into one cheap plastic bag so the food will get spilled. And after all, you'll be lucky if you get a "Sorry for the wait". Two times I bought food with this experience. Two too many, Not coming back.<//review>

Very good variety of fresh fruits, veggies, bread, pastries, food, etc.
Very crowded during pandemic, they aren't controlling the amount of people going in and out.< /Review>

<Review>Very rude staff. I used shop here for convenience and never EVER left without finding that they charged me for something I did not buy or over charged me for items I bought. I asked my friends if that was the case when they shop here and was shocked to find out that this is the norm. I am very happy I moved to another city and will never shop here again. Beware people and always double and triple check the receipt.</Review>< time>

Great selection of fresh produce and hard to find ethnic foods, spices and oils. No pork products all Halal. Cozy friendly store. Only downside here is the checkout lines are crowded but do move steadily. Love the ethnic flavor inside all the sights, sounds, smells transport you away from city. Love this store.<//text>

<review>It's kinda small but it was the most informative of the 2 we visited in the park. It's more of an art gallery with a small gift shop.< /review>< pictures>

Appeared to me to be an old time eastern style resort that doesn't really fit in with the surroundings.  The golf course is really out of place.</review>

I would also expect them to have up to date maps and information on how to get around. But this visitor center albeit having decent number of employees, isn't really doing anything except distributing maps and shuttle schedules (not to mention even those schedules are out of date).< /Text>< pictures>

Historic building. Friendly staff. Not as busy as the VC in the main valley. Exhibits are a bit limited and focused on surroundings. But you get info and prep for hikes.< /Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) Wawona, located at the southern entrance to Yosemite, was originally an Indian settlement. In 1865, Galen Clark built a Clark Station in the name of his own name, and visitors to the Yosemite Valley could spend the night here. In 1864, the Mariposa Grove, consisting of the Yosemite Valley and the huge redwoods, was officially protected by the Yosemite Grant. Clark was nominated as the first director of Yosemite (guardian). In 1875, the Wawona Highway was opened to traffic, and the Washburn brothers acquired the land. They built the Wawona Lodge and are still open until now.
In Wawona, visitors can learn about the development of Yosemite and the people involved. Showcase historic pioneering houses and carriages at the Pioneer Yosemite History Center

位于约塞米蒂南方入口处的瓦沃纳，原本是印地安聚落。1865年，伽林·克拉克(Galen Clark) 以自己名字为名在此地建了旅馆(Clark Station)，来到约塞米蒂山谷的游客便可在此过夜。1864年，约塞米蒂山谷和巨大红杉组成的玛利波萨森林(Mariposa Grove)正式受到约塞米蒂捐赠地法案(Yosemite Grant)的保护。克拉克被提名为约塞米蒂的首位主任(guardian)。1875年，瓦沃纳公路开始通车，沃什柏恩兄弟(Washburn brothers)取得这片土地，他们盖了瓦沃纳旅馆，直到现在仍在营业。
在瓦沃纳，游客可以了解到约塞米蒂的发展过程和参与其中的人物。在约塞米蒂先驱历史中心(Pioneer Yosemite History Center)，展示具有历史特色的拓荒时代房舍和马车< /text></record>

The workers have horrible attitudes and aren’t helpful. I won’t be returning and even though I’ve recommended people here before, I won’t be doing that anymore.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Review>My experience was pleasing.  Everything was constantly wiped down and sprayed.  The security staff was helpful and polite. Everyone had on protection gear for covid -19.  We checked in in a timely matter. And out within the hour. I'm excited and can't wait to receive my new pair of glasses.</Review>< Pics>

Horrible clinic. Receptionist have an attitude they dont pay attention. The clinic itself is always packed. You go in for a 11 am appointment youre not seen an hour or more later. I went in for a copy of my prescription and the lady gave me my prescription without telling me it was expired and that i needed to see the doctor. She lied about when my next appointment was supposed to be. She gave me some day in August. When in reality it was this month (March). Really unprofessional</text>

Great services, staff are very nice and patient with me .
I grately appreciate their services. Also from the doctors. I quess it's a different thing with those who works at the lab

But after picking up my glasses, the same day, anything round in shape looks oval, and through by bifocals, the reading is tiny more than, through my old pair of glasses.

This place makes me feel, that their partial or prejudice.< /review>

The staff are friendly and my doctor was very informative with describing my eye condition. The place was busy, so I had to wait almost an hour to pick a frame. That was the only downside, but to me it wasn’t much of a downside.< /review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80c2c81b3ce2c7fb:0x6dd1e1420aea5031</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<time>1611888484064< /time><review>The worst and worst place one can ever be!!!they made a seriois mistake I could even sue them but I preferred not to do it!!at first they gave me another patient’s eyeglass and hadn’t been I remembered the color of my frame they would have damaged my eyes!!then I got my lens you know what I wasn’t able to wear it even for two weeks because it was hard for me.I went back to change my lens to the one I have been using as I was fine with it.They told me to try it for atleast two months then I did.Sadly I started to see floaters and I stopped using it.I went back to the clinic and after a very long hustle regarding my examination under dilation appointment I managed to see a very nice doctor Dr Sylvius(apologize if the name isnot correct), after thorough exam she told me am doing fine,thank God!!then finally I decided to change the lens and went back again and requested to bring me back to the lens I was on before for which I wasn’t able to find the prescription.They made me pay for it out of pocket evenif I told to check if my insurance covers for it.they said no and paid from my card.When they gave me the receipt it was a wrong name and a wrong address and the funny part is it took her change atleast three papers to finally give me the correct receipt.Anyways I called my insurance and they told me that the insurance covers for it and they shouldn’t have made me paid for it.Omg!!!the worst experience I had in my entire life!!the worst customer survive!!they deserve “0” but the review start with “1”star.When I went back to get my refund they didn’t even apologize!!this clinic really sucks!!never going back again!!</review><gmapID>0x80c2c81b3ce2c7fb:0x6dd1e1420aea5031</gmapID><rate>1< /rate>< UserId.>

They’re taking extra measures to keeping patients safe. I saw Dr Luy and I would 100% recommend him his advice and patient care are the best. Takes the time to explain any concerns and answer questions. Then I was helped by Vanessa, good customer service. Keeps the flow going and answers all your questions. Pace is a little slow due to social distancing and cleaning chairs and objects after every patient but they Made my first and follow up visit go by very smooth. Definitely would recommend.</review>< pics>

This place was great! Yeah it was crowded but what do you expect? I patiently waited. The staff was great; especially the young woman that helped me pick out my frames! She was extremely helpful! Wish I remembered her name but she was young and had short mid length hair and had glasses! Her customer experience is what makes me wanna go back! So thank you!<//text>

<Review>I went here 1 month ago in June 2020 to get my daughters glasses replaced. As of today August 2020 her glasses are still not ready. My child is 15 yrs old and is falling behind in her school work because she can’t see! Every time i call them to follow up it’s always the same story. The glasses haven’t come in yet, we will notify you by text when they arrive. BS!!!!  I would not recommend this eye clinic if you are in serious need of glasses. You’ll be better off going to Walmart< /Review><GmapID>0x80c2c81b3ce2c7fb:0x6dd1e1420aea5031<//GmapID>< Rate>

<Text>My family been coming here for years so, I decided to try them out. Dr. Is very friendly. What I dislike is that I can never get a hold of anyone they never answer the phone. I order my contacts about a week and a half ago and I was supposed to get a notification when they were ready to pick up and I haven't received any phone or message. Is now almost 2 weeks. I can't believe they're going to make me drive to the office just because they can't answer the phone.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Their claim to fame or frame in this case is that they claim to offer same or next glasses "if" you pay for express service fee. Which  was like 40$. Last time I was there I did just that was told "next day" I was like that's fine. Next day I can't go. So I call 2 days later. Glasses still not ready told next week they'll call when ready. 5 days later no call so I go to complain in person told glasses are ready. I asked so..... what about my express service I paid for??? Was told non-refundable ... I was like .........???? fine........ Was asked to try the glasses I just took them and left. Too upset and much too crowded  barely had a chair to sit at the counter. Never been back since.  Now I just get my prescription elsewhere and order online. better glasses at about 1/3 the cost.<//review><userid>111399780725553529926</userid><Response>None<//Response><pics>None<//pics><Date>1573981978440< /Date>< name>

< Review>
This was my favorite place to get glasses as well. Two years ago my insurance covered everything. I got some ray bans.  Even the guy helping me told me I had a really  good insurance however I went for my eye exam again because they told me my insurance covers every two years and this time they are charging me like 250 and I don't even get the brand name glasses so I said screw this I know my insurance covers everything except of course transitions lenses or progressive but I don't need that. Well I will look for another eye clinic that won't try to make me pay that much.</Review>

I was  forgotten.  I came inside at 3.33pm to get a screw repaired in eyeglasses. I signed the paper and took a seat. It was 4.50pm when the receptionist noticed that I was still there. She asked for my name again, then
told me that I was on a repair desk list. Unfortunately my name wasn't called out. Gratefully, the man who fixed my glasses did it in less than 2 mins. I finally left at 4.55 pm. I was very sad.< /review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>I am so disappointed in the service of this clinic on 1-14-2020 I came to pick up my daughter's glasses they took one hour just to give me the glasses and they gave me a case that looks like a plastic bag which has no protection at all. I told Elloy  to give me the hard case and he said it's going to cost me $5. I told him that he already charged a lot to the insurance so I requested to speak to the manager they finally gave the hard case but they warned me that next time I have to pay for the case. This clinic charges everything and have bad service, I won't come back and if you don't wanna have a bad experience don't go there.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<Review>Excellent service. I was a walk-in patient and was seen by the doctor within 30 minutes. Great selection of frames to pick from. Staff is very patient and courteous.

<text>My glasses broke just before an important meeting, and I could not go to my eye doctor and get back in time.  I went there to get my frames repaired, and they did a great job. The front desk is overwhelmed, its a very tough corner, with a lot of noise and rude people,  but they pulled it off really well, thank you</text>< rating>

Today 50 years later L.A Eye Clinic and Center is still the place for afforable, fashionable eye ware. If it is Designer Eye ware you desire. L.A.

<Text>I wish I could give the place 5 stars but the ONLY thing that I disliked was the fact that I was told I was going to be getting my glasses within a week or even less. It literally took 2 weeks for me to get my glasses. The service is amazing, super friendly staff & the doctor I saw was great. I would definitely recommend this place but the downside is the fact that it takes too long for one to receive the glasses & I didn't appreciate getting lied too.< /Text>< pics>

< Review>
I have had diabetes for 5 years and needed to get a checkup and new glasses.  Dr. Kawabe was so kind and took his time checking my eyes.  I also got some new glasses.  The frame selection is vast!  I highly recommend LA Eye Center and Clinic.< /Review>

<rate>5< /rate><text>Dr. was great.  He was honest, and also provided some advice to a long time contact wearer. He gave me options, and also allowed me the opportunity to try out a new type of contact. I stuck with my original brand, but I appreciate the early adaptor nature of the office.

I did have a little snafu with the delivery of my contacts, beyond late. But all in all I am pleased with the office. I do wish I had more options in regards to frames.< /text>< Pics>

<text>Doctors are great, receptionists too...one lady in charge of ordering my prescription glasses wasn't too helpful ....also being an eye clinic they should be able to make their own lenses there instead of telling you it'll take about two weeks for them to come back and take nearly a month ....that's awful and of course I won't be coming back....I found a spot on Redondo beach blvd. and Crenshaw. ...it's a family owned business exams are only $25...their lenses are 80$ I believe and their frames start from $20 depending on your budget and the brand but the best part is you get your glasses in literally 20 minutes<//text><Rate>1<//Rate><username>Montes A<//username></record>

<review>Didn't know they still had my original prescription since 2001, and that prescription worked better than the stigmatism i had been paying double for, for the last 10, 15years. 8 eye drs on staff. I rather go there than Costco in which i been going to and they take no insurance. Happy with the eye clinic to the fullest.</review><gmap_id>0x80c2c81b3ce2c7fb:0x6dd1e1420aea5031< /gmap_id>< Rate>

I've been coming here for years but its time to find a new optometrist. Wait times are eternal. They take on to many patients. If you have an appointment you'll still wait about an hour. If you walk in you'll wait two hours. Ridiculous...</Text>

This place is a scam if you walk in there with cash or credit card they will take advantage of you I promise that much !
People who are using Medi-Cal Medicare or Medicaid these people are safe from the cash vultures. This review dose not apply to them.

I came in with real money and with a real expectation of this place however everything went downhill quickly... they charge me $65 per extra feature; such as antiglare and antireflective lenses each of those features will cost you $65 totaling $130! ... at Walmart those two features alone are free!!

On top of that I will probably end up spending $150 for everything that I need over at Walmart with good solid frames.  Turns out At this place they wanted around $250-$300 for everything.

Trust me when I say if you walk in there using credit card or cash and speak proper English they will take advantage of you.

On top of all this: the area is bone dry and extremely ghetto.<//Review>

I came here because i accidently scratched my cornea, it got infected and i began loosing my vision in my left eye. The doc gave me some drops and in 2weeks i could see again!! Plus I got my glasses here. It's usually hella packed but I've never waited more than 20 mins. Docs here are friendly.  Consultation is about 40 bucks without medical< /text>

The customer service and professionalism of this establishment  is horrible .  In one month I had to come three time and I was not attend well  .  I would called to check to see if the glasses  were ready  and they told me yes when I get to the location they weren’t ready and they will give me the runaround and  blame each other for their unprofessionalism .  That place is an unorganized  And I would not trust the ophthalmologist  here either  .  When I went to complain to the owner she only offered me free shipping  for my inconvenience  . I am  Very dissatisfying I would not invest my money  nor recommended this place .</Text>

(Translated by Google) The place is very accessible to reach, since it is located in a place where there are public transport services for the whole community. The clinic is quite spacious and its staff is very friendly and polite. There is a wide variety of lenses and frames for all tastes and economic situation according to your insurance which you can choose. The service is not too late. You can say that it is very good !! Everything is very good, the only thing I did not like was the sanitary service, the bathroom quite neglected. Jesus Bravo.

El lugar es muy accesible para llegar, ya qué está ubicado en un sitio donde hay servicios de transporte público para toda la comunidad. La clínica es bastante amplia y su personal es muy amable y educado. Existe una gran variedad de lentes y armazones para todos los gustos y situación económica de acuerdo a su aseguranza el cual podrán escoger. No es muy tardado el servicio. Se puede decir que es muy bueno!! Todo está muy bien, lo único que no me gustó fue el servicio sanitario, el baño bastante descuidado. Jesús Bravo.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Terrible service. Those who attend in front have a bad character respond very rude I had to see as one of the. Maids from there, I still raise the old man who was waiting for his glasses. And I remove it from the chairs. Where the glasses are repaired and then the one that did not say anything to the Lord was done. And the man told him that he was spending more than $ 200k because he was taking it out of there. I pass very fast and I couldn't say anything to that rude woman 😡 I wish. The owners check the staff x k if they are very rude it is noted that they did not study public relations SERVING THE CUSTOMER. RATHER !!

(Original)
Pésimo servicio los. Que atienden enfrente tienen un carácter pésimo responden muy groseros me tocó ver como una de las. Criadas de ahí levanto aún señor ya de edad que estaba esperando sus lentes. Y lo quito de las sillas. Donde reparan los lentes y después se hacía la que no le dijo nada al señor .  Y el señor le dijo k el estaba gastando más de $200  k por que lo quitaba de ahí Paso muy rápido y no le pude decir nada a esa mujer grosera 😡 ojalá. Los dueños chekeen al personal  x k si son muy  groseras se nota que  no estudiaron relaciones públicas  SERVIO AL CLIENTE . MAS BIEN !!< /text>

Makras Real Estate was fantastic in our search for a new home. It's not easy to find a new home in San Francisco, CA, but they made the process simple and stress-free. They worked over the weekend to get our application in and approved, and they kept in touch with us throughout the process. If you're looking for a new place, I highly recommend Makras Real Estate. It was by far the best experience I've ever had.<//text>

<text>We have been renting from Makras for 3 years and they are the worst management company I've ever dealt with. A few examples:

- Their 24/7 hr "emergency" hotline is in fact, not 24/7. It takes days or weeks for them to respond to emergency maintenance requests.
- There is a rat problem in our building, and we often find dead rats trapped, or laying in a pool of their own blood.
- We had a mold problem in our bathroom that took Makras 2 months to fix (they only took action after we filed a complaint with the city).
- The front gate of our apartment is always broken (does not close properly) and they refuse to fix it. Tenants have resorted to doing their own DIY maintenance on the gate.
- There aren't enough recycling or garbage bins for the number of tenants in the building, so the trash is always overflowing and Recology often refuses the bins as a result.
- On multiple occasions they have shut off our water for maintenance or remodeling work on other units without giving us the legally required notice (or any notice, for that matter).
- Everyone who works at the office is rude and dismissive.< /text>< Gmap_id>

I strongly advise you to hire Victor and Judith as your real estate agents. They have a wealth of experience and knowledge. They assisted me in both finding my dream home at a great price and selling my previous home for more than I expected. Thank you for a wonderful experience.< /text>

Makras Real Estate was recommended to me by a friend. I would give them more than five stars if I could. We were under an extremely tight deadline and needed to rent sight unseen. So, we rented based on their opinion alone. They exceeded all my expectations. They were extremely honest about the apartment we chose, so we knew upfront exactly what we were walking into. You won't go wrong choosing their service.<//Text>

Makras Real Estate was an amazing agency to deal with for my apartment search. They were super easy to communicate with and easily available to set up appointments for viewings. For someone with an incredibly busy schedule like me, they made the search super easy and smooth from beginning to contract signing. I found my new apartment with the full support of this team, right in the heart of San Francisco with an amazing view. I would highly recommend using them again someday.</Text>

I had such a positive experience using Makras Real Estate! They were phenomenal representatives who truly made me feel less stressed in helping me find the perfect place to live. They made sure I got everything I wanted in an apartment and more! I recommend this company to anyone looking to move in the area with the best customer service and speedy communication. I truly can't imagine anyone using any other real estate company other than Makras Real Estate Services!<//Text>

<Text>These people are just the worst. The apartments were dirty when they showed them to us, but you gotta live somewhere and we had friends in the building. They change the forms of payment that they were willing to receive from their tenants… And didn’t notify their tenants. They also would not allow us to rent garage space, for no apparent reason, in a part of San Francisco that has 18,000 people in 1.35 mi.²

I’d avoid them if you can.<//Text><Date>1620768902971</Date><user_name>Carlos Torres<//user_name>< GmapID>

Makras Real Estate Services performed a very important apartment finding task for me in just a few days. They were extremely professional, courteous, and took the time to listen to what I wanted. Their attention to detail ensured I got exactly what I wanted within my budget. I am extremely happy with how fast and how nice my new place is. I am thankful every day I walk into my beautiful home. They are solid professionals, and I look forward to using their services again as well as referring all my friends and people I know.< /Review>

We had the good fortune to be referred over to Makras Real Estate from our mortgage broker. They were thoughtful, patient, and always listen to our concerns. A few months later (delayed due to our part), we are now in our new home with a lot less stress. They are always on top of everything. We would gladly work with this team in the future, and you should too!< /text>

I decided to bring my family to San Francisco from Florida last year since my work required me to live here for a couple of years since our company just had an expansion and needs a supervisor to supervise everything. Looking for a house with Makras Real Estate’s help was certainly a breath of fresh air. They suggested different houses for the budget I have and was able to choose from it. Great thanks to them, they’ve been very professional and trustworthy. Highly recommend.<//review>

We own an investment property and unfortunately was taken advantage of by our previous management company. We decided to switch to Makras Real Estate after hearing from fellow clients about their great service. As I live out of state they took care of the transition for me, putting my mind at ease and took over the mess my previous company had left me with. The team is fabulous to work with, they are efficient and honest. I look forward to working with them for many more years to come.< /text>

Makras Real Estate was an absolute lifesaver! As I tend to do, I put off finding a new apartment until the last minute and started to get really worried that I would not be able to find a suitable place on my own. I was referred to this real estate company by a friend that had used their services in the past. I was completely blown away! Within a day, they had already compiled a list of apartments in the area I was looking for, as well as the price range we had discussed. I love their service! I’ll definitely recommend them to my friends.< /review>

Simply an amazing service that the Makras Real Estate that made me experience. It’s hard to trust real estate agencies since they could make the cost of a property go up and make more profit from it. However, the Makras Real Estate have a different approach to it, they offer you the best pricing for a property and you will not think twice about buying it. Aside from that, the houses they offer are in good condition, they also prepare the papers needed quickly. Highly recommend!</review>

Renters BEWARE - the 5 star reviews are without a doubt fabricated. I've lived here for 1 year now and it has been the worst experience I've ever had with a management company. I should have known from the outset when the agent didn't know diddly about the unit, that this company is a total farce. Call their emergency line because you have a plumbing issue? Don't bother, they won't answer, especially during COVID. I've been asking them since April (It's January now) to fix the callbox (had it inspected finally, it's so old it actually can't be repaired) because there is absolutely zero way for deliveries to contact you and you can and will lose hundreds of dollars in packages and many days of wasted time trying to track them down or waiting by the gate patiently when you should be working. They won't answer your calls or emails, and if they do it's usually "we'll look into it" but rest assured, they wont. And trust me, you will not get your deposit back from these people. Now I am just trying to move out of this hell hole and you guessed it! They're making that impossible too. Victor Makras is king of the slumlords. Don't say I didn't warn you.</Text>

It was a pleasure working with Makras Real Estate Agents. They were attentive to details, especially tour preferences when it comes to the location and design of the apartment that we were looking for, they also consider our budget. They made sure that we can see all the options that fit our criteria. I do love how they do their research and I do love to recommend them to others also. Thank you so much for your wonderful help.< /review>

Highly recommend this agency if you want to sell your home or find a home for you in San Francisco. They’ll do their best to find the best home for your budget and for your family. I was so glad that they were able to help me find a new home after I contacted them a couple of months ago. Just a month after I made contact with them, they were able to present me with the house that I really like. And now I am living in that house. It’s absolutely a pleasure to work with them.< /Review>

So much gratitude that I have with Makras Real Estate. They were very accommodating and easy to communicate while they are looking for a house. They updated me from time to time and took time to explain a house to me; the location, price, owner, and the renovation that I might have to do if I buy that certain house. They were really good at explaining everything through phone calls so that I won’t spend too much time visiting houses and traveling. Their level of expertise is second to none. Highly recommend.</Text>

Highly recommend this real estate agency to help you find a house for you. Absolutely recommending them.<//Review><Date>1590109826564</Date>< username>

Victor has been a lifesaver for us. He was accommodating and work hard to help us get the best deal that we could have. HE was very responsive, well informed, and professional to do business with. It was an excellent transaction we had with Victor Makras and his colleagues. Surely we will recommend this Real Estate company.</text>

Happy and contented with the property we have right now. Thanks to the competitiveness and the desire that the Makras Real Estate has, they gave us a property that fits our taste. They are just worth it.</Text>

I have never met a real estate agent that is very open-minded and helpful. Somebody who knows that you just wanted to sell your home at great pricing. A real estate that knows how to secure everything without spending too much on papers and mortgage. Makras Real Estate did it all, without stressing me and freaks me out with a huge amount of mortgage. I was happy that they were able to sell my house in just a few weeks after I made my first contact at a great price, thumbs up.</text>

Simply incredible agent and brilliant owner! Looking for a house is a big challenge but Makras Real Estate was there to help me and my family find our ideal home. You won’t be disappointed with the houses they’ll show you because aside from affordable pricing, they always make sure that it will fit your family type and needs. I would highly recommend this agency to find a home for you!</Review>

Mr. Makras is a very professional and friendly Real Estate agent. He will keep you updated on your search areas and will be in touch often and in a very timely manner. He does know the market well and knows how to negotiate with his customers and clients. Very happy with his professional service and affordable pricing. Two thumbs up.</Review>

Mr. Makras has done a great job of finding us a new home to live! He has been consistent with communicating with us whenever he finds a house that might fit our taste. Whenever we feel like giving up and just stay with the rental apartment we’ve been living, he is very consistent at giving us hope that we will surely find one that will be a good home for us and he did! After a few skips, we found a home that my whole family likes and we are more than happy when we finally had it in our hands. Thank you so much Mr. Makras for giving us a wonderful experience, I can't thank you enough.< /review>

As many of the other reviews on Yelp, I find their owner Victor is very hard to work with.  He is very, very, very arrogant and is very easy to get angry.  I tried to call him a lot of times and he only picked it up once and get yell at me over the phone when I confirm whether I heard him correctly.  Email or call him and you will see. Please stay away from this business.< /review>

<Review>It was my pleasure working with Mr. Makras for almost 3 years. I’m working as a renovator and I buy homes to renovate and sell at higher pricing. Mr. Makras was always there to help me out in order to sell some houses for my small business and he always works his best to get the best pricing for the house. Very helpful and undeniably great agent.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x808f7e14e6dd6053:0x6cd88da2761980b5< /gmapID></record>

<Review>They were easy and friendly to deal with and helped get things going so I could move into my new home as soon as possible. As a purchaser, I understand this was above and beyond given that their job is to work for the seller but as a first home purchaser having a group of people that helped me throughout the process was amazing. I'd highly recommend them if you're planning to sell or purchase a new house.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

You wont go wrong with choosing Makras Real Estate for your real estate needs. We had no idea what this process would be like, but from the start Beatrice took us under her wing and made us feel confident in our decision. I was in a situation that needed someone to listen and respect what I was dealing with and I can't explain enough how thrilled I was to have found her. I would recommend her services to anyone looking for a place.<//review>

Any positive review is clearly fake. Potential tenants stay away from this company they are miserable jerks and do not want to help tenants. We have homeless people in our buildings garage and Victor doesn’t do anything. There is regularly drug paraphernalia all over and they don’t care. Trash management. They are slumlords.

Victor—clean up the garage and stop being a jerk. Put the security camera back that you took away! This is just a passive aggressive tactic to push out tenants.</Review>

Be Aware!! Stay Away!
I rented a place with nice red paints from Makras Real estate 10 years ago. I moved out 2 months ago. First Victor was refusing to pay my deposit back trying to charge me for painting the walls.I rented it already painted. Then when I finally forced him to send me a copy of the initial walk through he saw that it was already painted when I moved in. He said he will return my deposit but he still has not send me a check to the address I provided on my move out walkthrough. These people are unprofessional and unethical.< /Review>

You are reading this review because you are either interested in doing business with Makras Real Estate, or you are currently dealing with the incompetence of either Judith, Maria, or Victor and are wondering "Am I the only one?". By skimming over the other reviews, it is obvious that you are not the only one, and that you should definitely stay away from Makras Real Estate.

If you are still somehow on the fence and are a functioning member of society who values their time and money, please continue reading my experience and hopefully it will steer you away. If not, then I guess blithering idiots like to stay in packs, which must be why Judith, Maria, and Victor all work together.

Of the various issues and unprofessionalism I have dealt with in my two year stay, this one sticks out.

I had a very serious rodent issue (I was catching 2-4 mice a day) and they sent a third party exterminator to fix. That exterminator ripped up the obviously cheap kitchen flooring when he was moving the fridge to check behind it. I documented it, and reported it to Makras. The exterminators sent someone else out to attempt to fix the flooring but did a very poor job. I documented that as well and reported it. I continually emailed Victor to make sure he knew this was not my fault and to not take it out of my deposit. He was extremely vague in his replies and said he was still "looking into it." They also never fixed the rodent issue, I had to purchase steel wool and duct tape to stuff inside the heater vent and block access.

Fast forward to me receiving my deposit back and they took out $500 for damages to the floor. I have contested it and of course they denied so now I am in the process of taking them to small claims court.

As someone who has rented five apartments for the past 8 or so years, I cannot recommend enough that you absolutely stay as far away as possible from Victor Makras, Makras Real Estate, and the other incredibly unprofessional employees.<//review>

We had them managed our rental property and they did an excellent job with it. Great communication and the staff were very knowledgeable. They are also very responsive to my inquiries and that alone made it easy to working with them.<//Review>

<Text>The experience I had at a Makras Real Estate was incredibly excellent. Our company is looking for space for our start-up. They worked hard for us to find a space that matched our needs quickly & expeditiously. I admit that I really hate hunting for places, but with Makras it was a breeze. Couldn’t be happier with our experience.</Text>< Name>

<Text>Best Realtor in San Francisco area. I had the pleasure working with Viktor and his team on finding a home to rent. They helped me every step of the way of finding a good home; they showed me what neighbourhood fit my lifestyle and they were very flexible w/time.  If you’re searching for a good realtor, your search is over. Please believe me when I say that you’ll be in the best hands. Viktor and his team were very professional and passionate about their client wants and needs.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

We were first time home buyers and we were not familiar with the process of buying a home, but Viktor was very patient with us and explained the steps along the way. He was willing to work with our schedule to show us homes and made good suggestions & gave good recommendations about houses that we might like to view. When we found the house that suited to our likings, he worked with us to quickly make an offer that was accepted almost immediately. We’re very happy dealing with him. We would highly recommend Viktor without a doubt.< /text>

No patience, politeness, and certainly no knowledge of how to deal with customers.

The 1 star is for the realtors and 0 for customer service.</Review>< user_name>

Victor and his team are a bunch of unprofessional crooks and if you don't pay attention, they'll try to steal your money and security deposit.
They also provide the worst customer service ever! It's extremely hard to get a hold of them as they never pick up calls or return voicemails, and when you email them you won't get a respond for days, even if you have an emergency, such as plumbing issue in a unit you're renting from them.
Stay away from this shady business operation!<//Text>

<Text>I was interested in a listing that Judith had posted on Craigslist for rental in Daly City. We scheduled a time to go view the property which was great.

By the time we arrived on time and early, we saw another family leaving, her attitude was completely unwelcoming, and uninviting. It almost seems as if she was uninterested in her job.

We didn't get a tour of the property we were she was just busy texting and motioned go ahead with her hands, to give ourself a tour.

After a full walk through of the property, I asked her questions why isn't it rented out, she said we haven't found a good tenant with 3x income and good credit.

Well, I have zero debt and a 720 fico score median, and make 10x their asking rent monthly. I submitted a full application via email that evening along with all financials documentation.

Waited all day the next day without any return emails or reply from Judy. Then I decided to text her to follow up. No replies at all that evening. Then the next day rolls around she texts back at around 3PM, your application was not approved. This was so baffling, I called back, voicemail, I texted back and she never bothered to even give me a reason why.

This is the worst possible experience you can have with any leasing agent or realtor. I am sorry to say but the subpar customer service here reflects in her attitude.< /Text></record>

What a joke of a property manager.  If you end up renting from these guys, MAKE SURE TO KEEP ALL YOUR DOCUMENATION. The accounting at this place is a mess (understatement).  They have been sending me the same illegal rent increases for 5 months now and have been completely ignoring the rent board's decisions. And now, they have the nerve to send me late payment notices because I don't pay their illegal rent increases.

LOL!

Not really. What a joke.  Avoid like the plague.< /Review>

As a tenant they simply don't care about you. Totally unresponsive to any issue you may have. Their staff had the gall to be annoyed by my asking when I could expect to receive my mail (due to the front door malfunctioning, the postal service could not deliver mail for 6 weeks).

Look, I'm taking the time to review a landlord. They really are awful, FYI.</text>

Phenomenal food and people. The food was so delicious. Super fresh food that you can tell a lot of passion was put into making it. One of the best restaurants around. From the waitress to the Chef you couldn't ask for a nicer group of people. I love the back room where it's a little private. Make sure you get dessert! The cheesecake and pies are amazing. Can't wait to send all my friends and family there.<//Review>

5 Stars. The food was incredible but the best part of the experience was engaging with our waiter Jeff! He made us feel at home and we had now only a delicious meal but we also had a blast. This place is a must. 👏<//Text>

Food was phenomenal. Period. Keep reading if you need further confirmation I guess.

Everything on the menu is home made style, like a top notch big city diner and the best place we ate on the road trip to Oregon all week. The BLT was perfect and the patty melt was superb. I can’t speak highly enough of the owner, chef and staff. We ordered to go when we were about 15 minutes out, everything was ready for us. I noticed when I was done eating they had espresso, so I went back in which is when I noticed the pie sign on the wall. A whole list of their made from scratch pies that were available. I got the chocolate bourbon pecan pie and even that was great!< /review></record>

We were walking in the Lava state park, and a couple recommended this restaurant.   Boy are we glad they did, food was delicious.   If you want farm picked fresh vegetables, you have found your place.   The potatoes were from a local farmers.  We had yhe salmon and coconut shrimp, both great choices.   The waitress Stephanie was super awesome and so nice, glad we met her.  Everyone there was great.  We will be going back.</Text>

<text>Stephanie was amazing! She was attentive and took very good care of my mother and me. We had been on the road for hours and we were very hungry. It seemed like everything was closed due to it being Sunday and after 5pm. We want to say a big thank you to the cook as well! Everything was so tasty and fresh! Definitely recommend to anyone traveling in Tulelake, CA< /text><userid>113496855555085140542<//userid><resp>None<//resp>< rate>

Not sure why the text was not posted, assume it is due to mobile service in the area. Long story short - it took almost 20 minutes to get a milkshake, only a lengthy time after ordering were we told there were items we would not be getting with our order (although a group who had ordered not five minutes before us at least got one of their baked potatoes), the salad bar one of our guests ordered was half empty.

We were given a reason of new ownership, but seriously? If it was that busy then our items should have been noticed as not available. There are not that many options on the menu nor are there too many people for a communication breakdown.

The people were relatively nice and the location was clean and enjoyable.< /review>

Great value for some really yummy food. Salmon  and steak both done perfectly.  And the potatoes were delish. Wonderful small town feel.  Felt like we were friends by the time we left.</Text>

During a long road trip back from southern California I stopped here for lunch. The service was great, the locals gossiping was entertaining, and the breakfast burrito was outstanding.

If you're checking out the Lava Beds National Monument or just driving through definitely spend some money here.< /text>

The food was so good. I had the chicken alfredo with a salad and for dessert ice cream. If you are ever in the area of Tule Lake in Northern Cal on 139 you have to stop by here.< /Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>This place is absolutely wonderful. I am from the east coast, but I plan on returning to Tulelake, CA just to eat here again. We came here twice during our visit to Lava Beds National Monument and both times were extremely enjoyable. The second night we came in five minutes before closing, fully expecting to be turned away and forced to eat our stale road snacks for dinner, but the friendly waitstaff welcomed us in and the chef even played the didgeridoo for us! Do not miss the desserts, either. They have the best pies. Even the photos on the walls are amazing. The chef is also a photographer and some of his pictures of the area are on display. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone!</Review><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

Small, old-time cafe. Super friendly server/hostess. Small beer and wine section... burgers we're de-licious! Must grab a slice of homemade pie to go, as well!<//review>

Great pies, good foods, great service.  This place is in the middle of nowhere, but it's worthy of a stop if you're by the Lava Beds National Monument near the Oregon side.  I have a patty melt with french fries and the fries were delicious!  The burger was good too, on grilled sourdough and swiss :-)  The prices are good too, and they also have wines by the bottle/glass from nearby wineries.< /review>

<review>There are two sites named Captain Jack's Stronghold. One is the restaurant on the highway and shown in the photos. The other is the historical site in the Lava Beds National Monument where Captain Jack and the Modocs held off the U.S. Cavalry for months and killed General Canby in 1873. It is an amazing redoubt, like a medieval castle with all the maze-like narrow pathways. It is no wonder the Modoc led the U.S. Cavalry on a wild goose chase for months, an episode that is long forgotten and supersed. The rough terrain is difficult on foot and even more so on horseback.om<//review>< Pictures>

I'm a Tulelake local and have been dining at Captain Jack's for many, many years.  The food is always great.  I usually find my way there a couple times a week for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Service is excellent and friendly.  Love the homemade wheat bread served with dinner.  The only bad thing is that they are closed on Mondays and the whole month of January.  I'm usually going through withdrawal by the time February rolls around.  Definitely a great place to dine if you are visiting the Lava Beds or the Klamath Wildlife Refuge or just driving through the area.< /text>

<Review>After a long day at the caves, we were hoping for a satisfying dinner. There are very few options in TuleLake. We were not disappointed in Captain Jack's. I had the chicken, basil, artichoke pasta with excellent Alfredo sauce and julienne side veggies. A large serving, enough for two people. Primavera was also available. BF tried the fried oysters and loved them. The wheat bread and salad to start was great. We finished off with their lemon cheesecake with marionberry sauce. All around delicious meal in the midst of small town offerings. We had the restaurant all to ourselves (early dinner about 5pm). The hostess and cook were very friendly and chatted about the area. We are returning to Lava Beds in June and will definitely hit up this place again.< /Review>< pictures>

Great meal in the middle of nowhere! Makes a great place to eat when visiting Lava Beds. The meals are homecooked generous and delicious. Undertand that this restaurant is deep in rural Oregon which by default makes it meat-centric. Deserts are worth saving room for a delicous finish. Staff makes you feel very welcome.</Review>

Casual local diner feel. Food was pretty good (I had the French Dip ... Nice but heavy), and the waitress very friendly and attentive.<//review>

Unusual find in rural N CA farming land and Lava Beds area. Amazing servings of high-grade beef locally produced. Definitely comfort foods on sides.< /text>

Food was absolutely awesome! Our server, Jeff, was the epitome of hospitality and great service! Captain Jack's is definitely the place to stop for a meal when coming through Tule Lake.< /Review>

Which was $9.89, way too much for what you get! When he put meat on it, I said to him, that is all the meat you are going to put on it and he said yes. To put more meat it would cost $3.50 more. I will stick with Jersey Mike's, where they slice the meat and cheese right in front of you. They are not skimpy either, you get what you pay for. The sandwich is almost 2 times bigger. Never again will I go to Subway, as long as you get more bread then meat. If I wanted to eat just bread, I would have bought bread and not a sandwich!</Review></record></dataset><record>

We’re really slow. We were there for literally 40 minutes for just two subway foot longs. A kid in front of us didn’t receive his order until we yelled at the staff. Didn’t even apologize. Just horrible.</text>

< Review>
I must say that I've received the most outstanding customer service from these two young ladies the other day that we're there at the time (it was Liz and I forget the other wonder lady's name). Anyhow they were super friendly, professional, and very multi-faceted dealing with multiple customers as well as keeping up with the condiments to have at hand. I just wanted to say way to go and I'll be back soon!< /Review>

<GmapID>0x80db68c7d5118cf5:0x2adf13bfd8bdaba9</GmapID><review>Alejandra is the rudest employee, she was slamming the papers to wrap the sandwiches and was rolling her eyes and huffing and puffing. When someone walked in she would look at the ground or the other direction from the person she was talking to and say "hi" with a completely disrespectful attitude. I have witnessed her specifically do this on several occasions on different days and I'm completely appalled that she is still employed in general. If you don't like your job and are unhappy,  then be jobless and happy so us customers can have a comfortable experience.<//review>< time>

I was charge a bit more for the $3.99 ham  6inch sub plus tax. I will never ever came to this sub again. I gave it a second chance but I will not give it a third one, sorry.  It's not worth my money and time.< /Text>< Pictures>

The sign on the doors says they should be open till 1000pm. I come back on June 15th at 720pm and store is closed, sign says store closed. This is how you run a horrible business.

Megan is one of the rudest employees I have ever came across with. She made this location and this company look really bad. She kept rushing me to finish my order of six sandwiches and I kept telling her to calm down and give me time to select my choices since I was talking too long for her she moved on and started helping other people in line. She then started bad mouthing me to the other customers in line and being overly nice to them making me look like I was the one with the problem she even offered to give the other people free sandwiches. The other young man that was helping me with my order was very professional. Megan even took pictures or video of me and my under age children.  I contacted corporate and they are contacting the owner since it's privately owned. I hope she loses her job customers don't deserve to be treated the way me and my family were. I'm not asking for any free sandwiches or anything like that just that this person be relived of her position so that I can return to this establishment that does better without her. I have been visiting this restaurant once a week for 2 years now and never had any problems with any of the staff. I don't think I've ever been attended by her either. If anyone has had problems with Megan I would advise you to call corporate and report her. Sadly I won't be returning as long as she is employed there. The restaurant is close to my domicile and I really like the food there. I took video of the encounter and I am thinking about putting it up on YouTube. I'll provide the link if I do for all to see. Hopefully the owner reaches out to me and takes action. The owner has the right to know how Megan is treating his/her customers. I would advise the owner to have Megan drug tested.</review>

<review>Never put enough meat or veggies or condiments on the sandwiches only the amount they think you deserve .If you want more it's extra money that is unfair . Because in the ads they show are beefy sandwiches and when you order you  get these flat sandwiches hardly anything on them weak sandwiches.</review><username>Laura Mickelson<//username><pictures>None</pictures><UserId.>108321415711787668758<//UserId.><Date>1571570698693</Date><Rate>1</Rate><Gmap_id>0x80db68c7d5118cf5:0x2adf13bfd8bdaba9</Gmap_id><resp>None</resp></record></dataset><record>

Tacos a vapor my favorite! They are healthier also huge plus!
They come in bean, papa, meat. All are super delicious. U get to add your own veggies n salsa.
Their salsa is amazing the flavor n spice I can't get enough of it!
I've also had their meat taquitos delicious also nice crunchy tortilla , but not over the top break your teeth type.
I highly recommend this place I keep craving em I've had em about 6 times past couple months!< /Text>

No es muy especial. Seriously, I went there and had a burrito asada. They wouldn't add cilantro and onions or green sauce. I've had much better. I asked them in Spanish and English, do you have refills on the soda and they said yes. When I went to get my refill, they tried to charge me a dollar?!.  I probably won't go there again.<//Review>

Some of the best traditional shreded beef comes with lettuce  avocodo sauce with the house red sauce it's pretty good. They deep fry them and how they go about it you just taste the difference. Out of all the tacos they have this one is the best by far. Potatoe tacos are worth the try, for sure. The service is really fast for dinning in and take out.</review>

<text>The specialty of Tito's La Especial are "tacos al vapor," aka steamed tacos. This delicious Mexican street food is also known as "tacos de canasta" (basket tacos) because they're traditionally layered in a big basket and sold by street vendors, many of whom hawk them from their bikes.

Tito's "Carne Deshebrada Taco Al Vapor" is excellent. Aside from steamed double corn tortillas comprising each taco's "shell," the chile-steeped shredded beef inside is soft, luscious, and as juicy as you'd want any meat to be. You do want to eat these quickly, before the tortillas begin to stick to the wrappers they are served in. Despite the fact they traditionally would be drizzled in oil (to help preserve them) and served out of a basket over the course of a day, these tacos are best made-to-order. I would also recommend the "Papas Taco Al Vapor," consisting of seasoned potatoes in a ranchera sauce, a loose mash of creamy crushed potatoes and firmer chunks, all colored orange from the sauce.

The "Taco Dorado de Carne Deshebrada" served here is the complete opposite of the al vapor tacos, as the tortilla is instead a crunchy deep-fried shell that is stuffed with stewed beef, lettuce, chopped tomatoes, and shredded cheese. Tito's does a decent job with this style of taco, but you really should stick to the al vapor tacos here, which are indeed "especial."

Tito's La Especial's salsa roja is made of fire and miracles and I recommend it be used on everything you eat here.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOi1XyvPqLMkx0USiLiN0vgmzc5PMbnZW3Zy3ED=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_dAf952Lp4CXpcj4EwFcNvHGr-eCJOp448So4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOAYocEnhdaptirVQEh4DqxQSODPVCsZxAcPPTM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmw0hZELb3PP9-z00K5BA2keJCNZX3kVLjolEJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMw9TlAN-w6GJWCQ6JIhyyPOrIAANMX0txnpuUC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOuAPcu6Jxdai3CiIrWyAHKoYOkR58VdEZOULRA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWXyYMOG3ZTjrLRaZPdPz2oMdCtwMyEkqf9Mw6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< resp>

<Text>Cashier's are rude and you have to spend $10.00 to be able to use your debit card/credit card. Good taste food but rude service. I wanted two tacos and they rudely said I had to purchase more.< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>Great food, Great price! The tacos are not your regular small size tacos, they are the ones you usually have at home with a full size tortilla! Al vapor is the way to order them! They are steamed and almost taste like tamales. All you need is 2 and you will be full! We messed up and ordered 4 and we had to stuff them because they were so delicious we couldn't stop eating.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Text>Best tacos al vapor (and I have been to plenty) on earth!! Especially the "tostada especial" I have been to most of their locations (sure do miss the orange location) and their staff especially the owner, are friendly and helpful. Haven't had  bad experience in the last 10 years that I have been a loyal customer.  If you haven't tried them, put on your bucket list!!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Tacos al vapor (steamed, more or less). Don't expect street taco prices. $2.49 for a small fountain drink and $1 to refill... Ouch! This, however seems to be a common occurrence among small, non-franchise establishments.< /text>

To fully appreciate the experience one needs to recognize that 'tacos al vapor' is a unique style of cooking/preparation.  These tacos remind me of my childhood and the great time our family had visiting TJ and the colonias near Rosarito.  Thank you for the memories.</text>< Pictures>

Tacos are good but too expensive...I bought a small soda for $2.51 (small cup, like the one in happy meals) when I asked for a refill the cashier wanted to charge me a $1.00 wth??  I don't think I will go back again!!</Review>

I don't know what happened but the food was not as we expected I guess our expectations reset hire based on the Stars but it's not what we got two chile rellenos and a taco plate which the tortillas were greasy and the chile rellenos were greasy this place had people sitting I guess we just weren't accustomed to the type of food<//Text>

(Translated by Google) The steamed meat tacos are the special, first try those and then the rest, I have been going to eat there for more than 20 years, before I went to the restaurant that they also have in Santa Ana on Harbor Blvd, either of the two places the Food is the same as good, right now I'm going to the restaurant on 17th and Ross

<Text>(Translated by Google) I was disappointed with the tacos. Very simple only lettuce with red sauce. No green sauce they have. And the tacos with double tortilla but little meat. Those taco chingaderas are not worth the price they pay. I personally do not return.

(Translated by Google) What a great disappointment !!! Tacos Tito's is no more Tacos Tito's. The tortillas broke off all of my tacos easily when I put the lettuce in. That made me realize that the amount of meat was minimal. But the most disappointing thing was that I noticed that the meat was contained strips of something, that if one does not pay attention, it is confused with the meat. You don't even know what to eat! I couldn't taste it, I think it was very thin grated potato. So sad!!!! They were one of my favorites.

(Original)
Que gran decepción!!! Tacos Tito's no es más Tacos Tito's. Las tortillas se quebraron de todos mis tacos fácilmente al poner la lechuga. Eso me hizo darme cuenta que la catidad carne era mínima. Pero lo más decepcionante fué que note que la carne estaba contenía tiritas de algo, que si uno no se fija, la confunde con la carne. Uno no sabe ni que se come!!! No le pude tomar sabor, creo que era papa rallada muy delgadita. Que triste!!!! Eran unos de mis favoritos.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Family place, clean. The tacos de canasta very well presented, of a good size and very hot. Its texture enchanted me in the same way. The only thing missing was a little seasoning in the stews, and a good sauce to add to the tacos, the one they have was not to my liking.

(Original)
Lugar familiar, limpio. Los tacos de canasta muy bien presentados, de buen tamano y bien calientes. Su textura me encanto de igual manera. Lo unico que le falto fuen un poco de sazon a los guisos, y una buena salsa para echarle a los tacos, la que tienen no fue de mi agrado.</review>

(Translated by Google) The tacos are delicious are not like those in Mexico but they are the closest thing you will find here in California. The waters are not fresh, they are from a machine.

Los tacos estan ricos no son como los de Mexico pero son lo mas parecido que vas a encontrar aqui en California.  Las aguas no son frescas son de maquina.< /Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) I think the prices of the tacos, are very exorbitant, 8 tacos, and two chiles rellenos, $ 38Dlls. I do not think I'm going back to that place.

<Review>(Translated by Google) The prices are too high. I am not a stingy person, I go out to eat outside three or four times a week regardless of the price, but in this case it was exaggerated, the prices do not correspond to the products.
They only have a register and a cashier, who answered the phone and took orders at the same time, it was delayed to be able to order, I ordered a chicken soup and a two taco combo. Once seated, the order took a long time to be ready, when I ordered green sauce, they didn't have it. DO NOT HAVE GREEN SAUCE !! How is that possible, do not serve green sauce? I started eating, the tacos were rich, the beans tasted really good, but my soup was weird, it wasn't even a Mexican soup! No cream and came with cheddar cheese (yellow) and tomatoes! It looked like a Taco Bell soup! I didn't know anything! And the soup was so hard that you couldn't eat.

Pros:
• Beans taste good
• Steamed tacos are rich
• Employees are friendly

Cons:
• They have no green sauce
• The order took a long time
•Expensive
• Hard and tasteless sopes
• The music was horrible
• Only a taquero doing multiple tasks

(Original)
Los precios son demasiado altos. No soy una persona tacaña, salgo a comer fuera tres o cuatro veces por semana sin importar el precio, pero en este caso fue exagerado, los precios no corresponden a los productos.
Sólo cuentan con una registradora y un cajero, el cuál contestaba el teléfono y tomaba órdenes al mismo tiempo, fue tardado poder ordenar, ordené un sope de pollo y un combo de dos tacos. Una vez sentada, la orden tardó mucho en estar lista, cuando pedí salsa verde, no tenían. NO TIENEN SALSA VERDE!! Como es eso posible, que no sirvan salsa verde? Empecé a comer, los tacos estaban ricos, los frijoles sabían muy bien, pero mi sope era raro, ni siquiera era un sope mexicano! No le ponen crema y venía con queso cheddar (amarillo) y tomates! Parecía un sope de Taco Bell! No sabía a nada! Y el sope estaba tan duro que no se podía comer.

Pros:
•Los frijoles saben bien
•Los tacos al vapor están ricos
•Los empleados son amables

Cons:
•No tienen salsa verde
•La orden se tardó mucho
•Caro
•Sopes duros e insípidos
•La música era horrible
•Solo un taquero haciendo múltiples tareas< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>
