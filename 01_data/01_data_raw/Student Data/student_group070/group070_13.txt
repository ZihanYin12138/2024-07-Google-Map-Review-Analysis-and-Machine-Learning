Initially I felt I was in the right place when I had tune time install my new stereo and speakers. After a few weeks of constant, and what grew to be louder and louder rattling in the doors, I felt the need to investigate. Both driver and passenger side speakers were installed with just 1 screw. Now I understand that we are in trying times, and construction materials are getting more expensive and harder to find daily....but come on....it was  4 more sheet metal  screws.....I also found it to be a nice touch when I stopped by after the stereo was installed to inquire about how the steering wheel control can be adjusted to change radio stations to ones that have been programmed and not scan up and down, and the response was to ask someone who cares. I know this was in jest, and I enjoy banter, but this was quite unprofessional. I'm not sure why any installer would assume the buyer wants to scan every station between the stations they actually have programmed. Maybe this is the new era of car stereos........still scanning............<//review>

I made the right choice to go to Mike at Tune Time. He was so knowledgeable and very patient answering all my questions.  My stereo job was a super simple touch screen in an older car but he treated it like it was a very important job and did an amazing job !
I highly recommend using Tune Time and Mike if you want the best for your vehicle.<//Review>

called to see about a system for my boat. The manager said he would need me to bring boat down to check it out. Hook the boat up and drive down there.  After 30 min of talking and him looking at boat I asked what's the damage. He replied i would need to bring it back again.  I said him for a quote? You just looked at it. long story short I left name and number and never heard back from him.</text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>I took my 2017 Jeep Renegade to Tune Time Stereo & Alarm to get a head unit installed.  Not only did they do a clean installation job but figured out how to make everything work with my stock steering wheel.   While getting my head unit installed they also tinted my winddows using 3M tint with a warranty.

They even made my stock USB port work with the new head unit.

I was so impressed I went back to talk about getting a subwoofer enclosure in my spare tire well.  My car like a lot of new cars doesnt come with a spare tire.  Instead it has an empty space and an air compressor.

They made a custom inclosure using two 10" Focal P25F subwoofers.  As you can see from the pictures I can still use all of the back and still have access to the subwoofers.  The pictures don't show that under the sub enclosure is my stock air compressor in stock location I also have access to.

They installed an Arc Audio XDI 1100.1 class D amp out of the way under my seat.

I highly recommend Tune Time Stereo and alarm for there knowledge and installation skills and they were nice people.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0S2ZS95sqVBjIt7c6v_gHN9Nh9EM6Cw9Gvajv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOslEJhPhv7AiqLvjZX6csSYrt73pHA7FU9vcyR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxDZrFMs79QyrACBHHolutzIduLRW--97uXk_b=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80c3554087da268b:0x9759722182f36d73< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I give this place less than 1star. I paid almost three thousand bucks. After a week I blow my back speakers and later find out those were just stock speakers. I suggest b4 u pay ur final bill have someone who knows theirs stereo equipment. Dude told me he only puts top of the line product when really I got a bunch of low grade equipment.</Review>

Seem like a very capable and honest shop.  My car alarm was behaving strange.  Periodically, it would not allow the car to start.  I took it in and luckily, the problem occurs.  The owner look at it, and told me immediately, you have a dirty connection at the battery.

Open the hood and it was a bad connection.  Jiggle the wire and the car would work.  So first item was how experience he was.

The second and more impressive was the lack of pressure to sell unnecessary repair.  I get it, folks are looking for free stuff and dishonesty occurs on both sides.  Definitely did not experience that here.  I tend to be pretty critical, but very positive first experience here.</text>

Tune Time Stereo and Alarm were very friendly, professional, and helpful in providing the right products for my car. They have good quality products. I am a returning customer. In 2009 they professionally installed the car alarm and on 2/27/16 they installed my new car navigation/ multi-media car stereo. It was done in the timely manner that they estimated it would take. I highly recommend this business for anyone who is looking for a great sound system or car alarm.</Text>

<Text>Their staff are genuinely honest people. I went to get help troubleshooting my alarm (didn’t even buy it with them) because it kept going off. The front desk guy came out and went through all the sensors and found out the interior light was left on and that triggered the alarm to go off. Did not charge me a dime, didn’t even have an appointment. Other shop wanted $70 for “diagnosing”. Definitely coming back for future business< /Text>< Pics>

Real good place to get your audio setup and installed. Really knowledgeable. Owner is real friendly and really does his research on any problem you might have.< /Text>

I went there on Saturday to ask about my car radio. The guy that works there said since the radio is factory issue & died on me, it's going to be really expensive to install an aftermarket radio. Wouldn't be worth it since I plan on trading the car in. Wasn't my fault the car radio died! After all - the car is a FORD! 😞</review>

If it's about getting great sound, go to Tune Time and go now.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<review>Mike the owner is very knowledgeable and honest. I have used his services for over 4 years and trust his opinion and price quotes. His workmanship is flawless. He does the installation himself and does it right from the first time.<//review>< response>

I changed my existing F-150 stereo at Tune Time. Once I explained my needs to the Owner, he was helpful and suggested the stereo I needed and it was one of the least expensive at his store. The installation was fast and clean.

They even referred me to someone who could do non-related repairs on my car while it was having the stereo installed. Had to return the car once for wiring that came loose but it is going on 4 years now without issues in the stereo/alarm system.</Review>< rate>

Hands down the best experience I've ever had at a car audio shop.
I have had so many bad experiences with car audio shops in the past I decided I would just do the work myself with very poor results. I took the mess to Tune Time and Mike fixed everything in a short amount of time at a great price.
Don't bother looking around just go to Tune Time.<//text>

<review>With so many sushi spots in the area, deciding all comes down to criteria.  Taru Sushi stands out from the crowd by its small cozy atmosphere, fireplace included, and ambitious portion sizes (and I mean, really, really abundant) of fresh ingredients.

If you go home hungry, you are doing something really wrong and should seek professional help.

The three pillars of sushi -- sashimi, nigiri, and rolls -- are all covered in ways that are similarly plentiful and priced fairly.  Sashimi portions and cuts make it more worthy of being labeled as sashimi steaks, nigiri portions involve multiple bites, and the rolls are no exception!

Over many visits, service is noticeably a total hit that you look forward to returning to or a complete miss that makes you regret having to tip as though it was for service (at sushi prices).  Being a family business, you can easily tell a difference between the owners and hired help.  Focusing on the positive, when it's good -- it's warm, friendly, attentive, while easy going...<//review><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

Most other folks have frozen for a large part of their fish offerings. I also like that they offer gluten free options (I.e. soy sauce) and they are very sociable folks when sitting at the sushi bar.<//Review>< name>

We really enjoyed this place. As others have commented, service is a bit slow. One person seems to cover the whole space. The fish seemed fresh and they gave you good size portions. The hand rolls had chunks of fish instead of the ground mish-mash you usually get.< /text>

Today was my first time here and it was delicious! The fish was super fresh and the staff was friendly, especially the lady who took our order and served us. Our order wasn’t right but without saying anything she immediately fixed it. I’d definitely recommend this place!!!</Review>

<Text>Last night was the third time I've been here. The fish is always very fresh and tasty. Service is friendly, quick and overall excellent. We had the Jedi, the prospect, and a spicy scallop roll. I've been a little worried that the spicy would be too spicy but the waitress assured mean that it's not very spicy and she was right. There was a nice level of warmth on the spicy items and they were not overrun with red chili powder. The spicy scallop hand roll surprise me a little because I saw only scallop. There were no radish Sprouts, cucumbers, Tobiko or seasoning flakes like at other places, but the flavor was really fantastic. I really enjoyed their house sauce that came on a couple of the things we ordered. It added a bit of spice without completely taking over. Great place! Will be back.</Text>< pics>

<review>High Quality Fish....... Looking at the menu, we weren’t very inspired so we ordered something we usually avoid, the ever basic rainbow roll. We figured, We’ll get to taste a variety of their fish. It was so quality we ordered another. Dragon roll was solid, salads were very good and I went off menu and got a pretty good hand roll.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

<Rate>4</Rate><Text>This restaurant is very clean which is always appreciated and a great first impression. It was too dark inside, in my opinion. For such a small place 2 flat screen TV's was way too much. A nice fish tank would have been more visually appealing.
Our server was extremely kind and helped us by recommending some of her favorite items. She was really great-but I did not get her name.

The food was wonderful but I wish the menu had more details about the items such as a helpful description of each. Blindly ordering can be fun but I like to have some insight as well. Please add this!

Overall it was a nice dining experience and we will probably be back at some time in the future.<//Text>< Pics>

<review>This place has gone downhill pretty quickly. My first visit some 8 months ago was great. The quality of the sushi and service was really good. Unfortunately that is no longer the case.  My son and I went here last night and the  sushi was mediocre at best. The Salmon was very chewy and the Tuna was very fishy. I had to remind our server of our order several times and service overall was pretty slow. The menus they gave us were crumpled up and dirty. We will not be returning< /review>< pics>

<user_id>112589622730519743648<//user_id><review>Taru Japanese Sushi & Cuisine Review

Once again I was hoping for a good Japanese sushi restaurant and my wife and I went to this restaurant for the first time boy was I disappointed. First of all the restaurant is somewhat small and down in a alleyway. The Decor of the restaurant is very dark, with very inexpensive chair, in the kitchen that seems to be a last-minute idea.

I ordered sushi, which came in large pieces though it seems like you’re getting a good deal of salmon, it was not sliced like a normal piece of sushi. If felt like just a big piece of fish in your mouth. The rice that they use for the sushi was a long grain and not normal sushi rice and the formula that they used for the rice was not authentic. The California roll was tasteless. When we arrived at the restaurant children in joining table were so loud that we had to move outside. Overall I would not recommend the sushi restaurant to anyone very disappointing low quality and not athletic. When you spend $65 for sushi I want more of the real thing. On the lookout for a good sushi restaurant…< /review><response>None< /response><rating>1<//rating><pics>None</pics>< date>

Mother's Day Fail.

This place gets one star for the food.  This is a tragedy because if the service was anything near acceptable levels it would have had five stars.  Everything we tasted was excellent.  The problem was we had to celebrate multiple birthdays while we waited for our order.

It took twenty minutes from the time of our reservation for someone to come over and see if we wanted anything to eat.  Another forty minutes later, our appetizers started to arrive.  In the meantime, no checking on us from the wait staff, refilling drinks, no apologies for the delays.

Nothing.

I loved the part when our server came over and asked us if we needed anything else.  Never mind they had not even brought our sushi orders yet.  How brain-dead of a question was that?  Had to remind them multiple times what we were missing.  Complete incompetence across the board.

Sadly, we weren't the only ones experiencing these issues.  The tables to the right and left of us had their orders screwed up as well.  At one table, the couple said "just bill me for the drinks and edamame and we are out of here."  They never received their sushi order.  At the table on the other side of us, they received one order of sushi before us despite the fact we arrived earlier.  After that - nothing.  They also had to remind staff of what they ordered.

I think all of us understand that holidays create excess demand on many restaurants.  This place has been in business long enough to know that you have two choices when that happens.  Either staff up so that you can provide a good dining experience for the folks you place at tables.  Or, close a portion of your dining room to ensure you don't subject your excessive guest count to a negative experience.

Unfortunately, they decided to pack 'em in and let the customers wait.  Let's gain as much $$ as we can and compromise our reputation as a dining establishment in Danville.

Not sure whether this review encourages any of you reading it to look elsewhere, but I encourage you to do so.  While the food was good, it did not make up for the poor service experience and operational incompetence of this restaurant.

We won't be back.< /Text>

Came here for our second time just to make sure the first amazing time wasn't just a fluke. Taru killed it again. Super fresh, GARGANTUAN sized nigiri, delicious tuna kama, and pretty unique and creative rolls. I feel like this is a hidden gem and am looking forward to showing it off to my sushi loving friends< /Text>

The food here is definitely worth the price. I had a takeout order, and was skeptical on how the food would turnout after making the trek back home. Let's just say that it made it back but didn't stand a chance once it got there.

The food was great (fish still fresh, soup still hot).

First off, the salmon skin salad has enough salmon so that you have a piece of salmon with every bite of salad.

Secondly, the sashimi portions are generous and were quite tasty (salmon. tuna. yellowtail).

Even the udon soup exceeded my expectations!

All in all, I've had nothing but positive food experiences here.<//text>

Best flavors for sushi that I've had in a long time. Proprietors are friendly, they worked hard to fill a large carry-out order with less than two hours notice. I wish parking wasn't such a challenge though.<//text>

<Rate>4</Rate><text>It was the tale of 2 restaurants. I didn't care for the place very much when I walked in. First, unless it's a sports bar I don't care for restaurants with TV. Eating out for me is as much a social event as it is for food,and having to compete with a TV is distracting and takes away from my friends and I enjoying each other. And in such a small place there were 2. So...strike 1.

Strike 2 was the service. It's not that our waitress wasn't friendly. She was very unhappy! And this wasn't just my impression but the 3 of us agreed on this. And yes, I know the Japanese style, having been there and worked for many years in SF's Japantown. This woman wasn't reserved- she was sullen and depressing. And she had to be asked to bring over our napkins and silverware and repeated requests for water. And mind you it was over 90 degrees outside and the restaurant didn't believe in turning on their a.c. much. And is it expecting too much to have the table next to us cleared so we aren't looking at people's leftover food the entire time? The place wasn't busy and it appears that, with it close to closing time, they were going to clear the table with all the others.

So I was thinking 1 star and couldn't wait to leave. Especially after I got my miso soup, which I didn't care for very much. Maybe the region from which this miso soup recipe comes from is different from all the miso soup I have had in the past (a lot). But the broth wasn't as clear as I have had before and it was 'heavy' in taste. It seemed that the miso was much more fermented than what I am used to. Well, for my tastes I wasn't crazy about it.

The saving grace for this restaurant, and the reason I will go back in spite of the negative things above, is the taru special rolls we ordered. They were, indeed, among the best sushi I have ever had. I ordered the 'Volcano' and it was fantastic. Each flavor, the fried spicy tuna, jalapeno, cream cheese, tobiko and green onion were both distinct and blended together in your mouth. So many different sensations! And in spite of how good it was, I may have liked the baked Lion King roll better.

Before I had the sushi I thought there would be no way I would return. But the food really made up for the crappy service and lack of ambiance. I really hope it was just a bad day for our waitress and the next time will be better. And maybe it will be cooler so we could sit outside and not have to see the TV :)

So for the food I give it 5 stars and, for now, will only take off 1 star for the lousy ambiance and service, because I figure most people are more interested in good food than good service.< /text><response>None<//response><pictures>None</pictures><userid>112836515862961261310<//userid><Gmap_id>0x808f8ca99a35a9c5:0xadd58cb751918de< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Today, the waitress was RUDE. I PICKED UP AN ONLINE ORDER AND SHE TOLD ME TO GO OUTSIDE AND SHE WILL LET ME KNOW. SO I WENT BUT 10 MINUTES AFTER MY ORDER IT'S BEEN SEATING IN THE SUSHI BAR FOR I DONT KNOW HOW LONG. IT'S BEEN READY BUT SHE DIDN'T EVEN CHECK ALL 3 BAGS IN THE SUSHI BAR. RUDE, RUDE, RUDE</text>

< review>
Pete is a great barber and an even better guy. He does a lot in the community, and he runs his shop like a family which shows in the nostalgic, homey atmosphere of the shop. All of the barbers are talented. My personal barber, Mr. Al Jones, recently moved away, but I've gotten cuts from most of the other barbers, and I've never been unhappy with the cut. Pete's by far the best, but he keeps a tight crew. Besides Mr. Al and Pete, Louie is also pretty good with Black hair, but that's not to take away from Mauricio and Cisco. I've seen both of them cut, and Mauricio has cut my hair before and done well. Walk-ins are welcome, but I recommend making an appointment otherwise you'll be waiting a while. This is a great place for anyone looking for a classic barbershop: no gimmicks, no frills, just skills, and plenty of trash talk.</review>

Today was my first time here, I think I got lucky because I hear they are extremely busy but I sat in a chair within a minute. Its 20 for a walk in or 25 for an appointment which is the cheapest cut I've had in SB but also the best cut I've ever had. Mauricio paid attention to every detail on how I wanted my hair, he also asked to double check before he made a move. Very quick, friendly and professional. I'm the type to hop around barbershops but Mauricio was so good, I'm going to stick with him.</review>

<Review>All these guys know how to give clean cuts, I never doubt the person who is cutting my hair each time I'm there.

Sure the wait is long but obviously if someone is good at their craft you are going to have to wait to be served. And most people who walk in and get served immediately have an appointment. At first I was annoyed but then I ask, and now I take full advantage of that service.< /review>

<Text>Went in for a haircut earlier today and almost passed out in the barber chair. The guys here were helpful in every way, brought me water and a snack, and even lightened up the mood during a serious situation. Plus the haircut was fire. Apparently these guys have the fire department comming in 20 times a day because they get a whole lot of false reports about firesbreaking out in their shop due to fire 💈🔥🔥🔥 cuts. Thanks for the crispy cut!!<//Text>< userid>

Really like the way they cut my kids hair, all three of them; Alex, pete, pedro. I don't mind the wait at all, however when they start cutting people's hair that walk in after my kid waiting for a while, that's when I get P.O! I'm starting to think maybe they need to have a number system just saying. As much as I liked their haircuts, We're not going back. It was nice while it lasted.

hIle it lasted. .</Review>

<Text>Made an appointment. Walked in ten minutes early, no greeting, barely any eye contact. Place is cluttered, not impressive. 23 minutes later, my name was called. Had to pass.<//Text>< Pics>

<user_name>Eileen Vega<//user_name><date>1615138247164</date><Rate>1< /Rate><Text>I went into this store around 630 pm on March 6th to make a purchase and to speak with someone for hair services.   There were 2 ladies each with a client.  I didn't want to interrupt but I had a question about getting my hair done.  I was never acknowledged. They both looked up and saw me.  My husband was with me and they made eye contact with him as well.  They could have said that they could assist me once they are free or some sort of acknowledgement.  I have never experienced such cold service.  I decided to purchase my items and will be going someplace else to get my hair done.  My company understands customer service, continuously holding frequent training for all personnel with the objective of ensuring all are held accountable for the business success knowing customer service skills are vital for all businesses.  Despite the experience I had,  the cashier was outstanding.  She even acknowledge me as I was waiting in line.  Maybe the ladies in the hair services could learn some skills from those in the front of the store.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<review>First off I had NO IDEA ULTA had a hair salon in the back. I was shocked and also curious. I had really long hair, Close to mid butt and I wanted a change with cutting it to my shoulders and also adding some color to my virgin hair. I looked at multiple pictures online and let Chalsea know what I wanted.  Let me tell you!! This girl did her thing and made me fall in love with my new look as well as my husband. Very professional and passionate about what she does. If you need your hair done and want a relaxing experience hit Chalsea up and book with her.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

This place has some of the worst managers here. Jessica has been the only one that knows how to actually help a customer. Been going here since they opened and their staff keeps getting worse. Few ladies that work their are friendly but you rarely see them. I have left the place crying because 2 managers couldn't figure out how to do a return on the items I bought online. I try to avoid this place as much as I can.<//Text>

Went in ready to do some serious shopping and the choices were slim.  Ulta needs to work on keeping items stocked.  Not just at this store but every one of them!  They are always out of stuff!  The only thing that brings me back is the staff.  They are always friendly.</Review>

Needs a more diverse and attentive staff. I went in to get color matched for foundation for the 3rd time last week. The first two times I got matched with the completely wrong shade for me.  Each time a different shade and when I got home to test it out I looked like yellow chalk. Wasn't even close to my neck color. The 3rd time I went in to get color matched I asked for assistance and was immediately ignored for another customer and her husband. Whom the sales associate was busy checking out. He's married. His pregnant wife was standing right next to him. It was the most unprofessional and disrespectful thing I have ever seen while in Ulta. I walked away and proceeded to try and color match myself. About an hour later after struggling an associate finally came up to me, but she was literally no help. She had no idea how to color match a someone brown or dark skin. She kept bringing shades that were entirely too dark or that had a golden undertone. Idk why you guys keep trying to make black women golden. Some of us are olive or neutral undertoned.  Please hire more employees of color and give them hours, so that those of us with melanin can get properly color matched. It's 2020. There is no reason for that to still be an issue Ulta.<//text>

<text>Three stars because weird customer service, Manager was giving attitude to the customers because they were making only one line but there were two cashiers. Wasn't customers fault because the store doesn't have signs on the floor for more than two customers at the time. Then after pay, the cashiers were sending customers #1 out walking back where the line is exposing the checked out patient to 5-6 more people, instead to send the customer #1 walking out behind the customer #2 in the second cashier exposing customer #1 and customer #2  to only one person walking out. ???? Her logic doesn't make sense at all.< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>I read so many bad reviews but I've personally have had great experiences here. I come in and I'm patient because they are sometimes helping others and I thank them and smile and they return the gesture. They always help me out and show me the best products for my skin type. They have also matched the prices from online for me...I will keep going!</Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80dcca768dfe4dbf:0x5df06e117080d1ef< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>ZERO STARS!   I scheduled a 6:30pm hair appointment 2 days in advanced. When I arrived I walked passed the door of ultra on accident because they had construction wood in the doors because the glass broke? I’m thinking to myself “I can’t believe I’m about to pay money for a haircut with an entrance like this. I wanted to go somewhere nice because I want to cut my hair short. Anyways I walk in and the salon section is empty. I was greeted by staff and she said the hair stylist will be with me shortly. I went to the next isle and she was talking to another worker and they were saying how  the hair stylist went on lunch. She calls me over and says she was with another client and will be with me shortly. So she lied Because she obviously went to lunch. So anyways she said she will be 20 min. I come back 15 min later and she’s blow drying someone else’s hair. She says she will be with me when there done. At this point it’s 6:40pm (I checked in 10 min early) well I over hear the staff and the hair stylist have a conversation about how she’s so busy and doesn’t have time to do all these appointments. So I asked if we should reschedule (after overhearing them) and the hair stylist snapped at me saying “well I had to take my lunch and I don’t even know what’s going on right now” in a rude tone. So I told them I don’t feel comfortable and I talked to the manager and she could care less. This store is in a nice area but a ghetto place. The staff looks like they work in a trashy hot topic. I cried because I work full time single mom 2 kids. My time is valuable and I had to make time to do this because I rarely get to get my hair done. I don’t have time for drama or games especially with a business that should be able to take care of there customers. Now I have to reschedule and find time to go..< /Review><rate>1<//rate>< Resp>

Me and my friend had the absolute PLEASURE of meeting Melissa the Clinique boutique manager, and it was the best day of my life. An absolute QUEEN. Y’all are sleeping on her for reallll. She’s so incredibly sweet and absolutely BEAUTIFUL. She should just automatically get a raise for walking into work and blessing everyone’s eyes. I’m shook. We will be coming back with Starbucks for her. Love, alicia and sandy 💕🌝<//review>

<review>Worst Ulta location by far. Please save yourself the headache of terrible customer service and rude employees. I had an appointment at the salon, with stylist Biana on June 29, 2019 at 2PM. I arrived and had to wait 30 min just to be seen and there was no sorry for having to wait. The entire time of the appointment Biana had the worst attitude and did not say one word to me. She then was talking to one of the other stylist beside me, speaking in a language I could not understand.

I walked out very disappointed with the color and style of my hair. She did not wash it with shampoo and nor did she style it.

Again, please save yourself the money and headache of getting your hair needs done by Biana, she does not deserve the clientele.

This location does not deserve any stars as they need to teach their associates better customer service skills!<//review>< Rate>

<review>The employees here lack customer service skills and the attitude is poor! Everyone treats customers like we owe them something, they don‘t ever smile, or offer any help. Once you are ready to pay, they take the payment and wish you are out of their face. Oh, and they all discriminate against people not their own race. Its too bad this one is closest to me, otherwise I would go to another store. I would give them zero stars, one is too much for them.<//review>< pictures>

It was already too late and the store was closed. I decided to go back in the morning and I saw that the item was put back on the shelf since there was only one left previously when I had picked it up. So I told the girl that the girl from last night forgot to put that item in the bag. I showed her the recipet and showed her the bag and how the items that I purchased with the missing item were still in the bag and I didn’t remove anything from it. Then, she told me she would check the camera to see what had happened, but, she came back and denied to give me the item that I had purchased but did not receive. I am very unpleased with the service. If there is eveidential proof, then why deny it? There is no reason for me to come up with a lie about an extra item I had purchased and found it to be missing from my shopping bag right when I came back home. The girls that work there were not helpful at all and very rude.zero star</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

DO NOT GET YOUR HAIR CUT HERE!! I also must warn you of Roxanne. I am not sure if she was ever trained properly or forgot her training, but whatever the answer is my hair has been ruined.  She cut off most of my mom's hair and was unable to style it because she cut it so short. She spent about 20 minutes to wash, trim, and blow dry my hair.  While this may have been sufficient for some hair, since we are am African-American, simply blow drying is insufficient to complete the service on my hair.  It requires flat ironing or some other styling as well.  Roxanne said she did not "know" how short hair could be flat ironed-a testament to the vast amounts of information she does not know.  AVOID THIS SALON AT ALL COSTS! Ulta should not employ someone so incompetent. The worst part is Roxanne had no remorse over the haphazard job she did.</review>

<Review>I love this store, but t I did have a really hard time trying to schedule an appointment with the aesthetician. It is important that the associate answering the phone can understand the English language. It took about 10 minutes to schedule a simple appointment. I'm sure she is a very nice person, but she really struggled to understand me, and vice versa. I think it is important to state that the store is great otherwise.< /Review>< Pics>

If you ever wonder what poker face looks like in real life, try this store. They have got all the employees to have poker face all day long, and they won‘t try to be helpful or friendly.</Text>

<time>1457714217084< /time><rating>1< /rating><review>I've probably been to this Ulta location a couple of times and both experience have been disappointing. For being in a nice city like Eastvale, their customer service is absolutely ridiculous. Walked around for a while(mind you, I knew what I was looking for) not one employee greeted me. A few employees passed by me and not even a hello, can I help you find something? Nothing! I live 5 min away from this Ulta but I rather drive to Victoria Gardens where I know I'm going to receive a better customer service experience.</review>< Pictures>

I recently started shopping at this ULTA. I have to say I am definitely impressed! Everyone is so welcoming and knowledgable! I also visited the Brow Bar OH MY GOD JACKIE IS THE BOMB! She was so patient with my requests ( I have sensitive skin) and took her time doing my brows and showing products that are best for me! I would definitely recommend to anyone!<//text>

First and last time shopping here! They have a special where if you buy buy a Hot Tools brand item at $49.99 or more you get a free Hot Tools styling tool. They told me they were out but would be getting more but couldn't rain check me for one. False advertising and not accommodating customers! The manager was to bothered to even come talk to me. Rude!< /Text>

One of the worst customer service you can ever imagine. Literally all the employees are just standing around , just look at you and don't even bother to help. Sucks that this is the only one nearest to me . Doesn't even deserve one star.< /Review>

The manager is awful they are very rude. They are more interesting in going home than taking care of their customers. Came in twice and both times I was treated very rude by the girls upfront. When I spoke with the manager she was not any better. Would stay away.< /text>

This place is the worst. Had my hair cut and dyed and they botched it. Let the manager know and she said there was nothing they could do for two weeks. Also they were going to charge me 45 dollars to fix their mistake.  Went in on a seperate occasion for advice on what color foundation to get and the blonde lady with the makeup plastered on is stuck up and rude. Love the products hate the people step it up Ulta.<//Text>

Went in to get my hair cut and I was super nervous, I usually don't trust hairstylists enough to cut my hair and I had been razor cutting it myself for about ten years.

Well... that quickly changed!!!!

Roberto in the Salon is a magic man. Not only was he able to get most, if not all of, the dead hair cut off but he was able to somehow keep the length and restyle it into a more professional and manageable hair style...

I was in love!!! and I found out that I can get him to color my hair soon too!! While I was in the chair getting my haircut, other stylists at the salon were asking his opinion on hair colors/what mixes/what works best for ombre/how to cover this or that...etc....I was not at all ignored or interrupted but he was able to call out colors and how to's like a god! And all I kept thinking was " and how long has this kid been doing hair?" He definitely will be in a fancy upscale salon that charges Big bucks faster than he thinks.

He is a genius hair chemist and stylist and I would recommend him to EVERYONE!!!

I will get my hair completely overhauled by him soon and I am not at all nervous and I cant wait to brag to all that comments " Roberto at ULTA Eastvale did it!"

My recommendations: Go In. Make an Appointment with Roberto. Love your hair again.

oh and even if he isn't working and you are scheduling in advance... tell them you want him there that day and he could get scheduled... BAMN!!</Text>

<text>This store isn't always great I'm always just in and out but today I was approached by Jessica while looking for moisturizers, she helped me pick out a product to try out, she asked questions to best fit my needs and I'm very thankful for her help, the ones with pounds of insecurity makeup could use a change of attitude though.</text>< Pictures>

<username>Judy</username><Text>Customer service horrible! You need to ask for if you order wings or tenders. Also, butter and honey for your biscuits. Do they have a sign in the drive thru stating this? No they do not. I got home with zero condiments and when I called to complain; I got a sarcastic , unfeeling sorry and to ask next time. I will not to go this KFC again!!!<//Text></record>

This KFC is nice and it’s fast. The food I ordered came out fresh and it was good. It’s a good kfc location with a good manager. It’s also right off the freeway so you can be in and out very fast.<//text>

<name>Marylou Escobedo</name><Text>I went to this KFC around 9:40 p.m. I ordered the crispy colonel sandwich combo. I wanted popcorn chicken he said they didn't have any. When I got my order my sandwich look like the slider size with no pickles in it and my fries were cold. He seemed irritated and wasn't friendly. He didn't have customer service skills as anyone who works with the public should have. I'd I can give zero stars I would.<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>The absolute worst KFC I have ever had.  I ordered a sandwich meal that came with popcorn chicken, French fries, coleslaw and a drink.  With an extra side of mac n cheese. The didn't give me a spoon for fork. The only thing that was even good was the soda. Everything else had yesterday's texture.  Soggy chicken, hard bun, stale fries and baby food macaroni and cheese. Awful!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

The drive through window employee Joshlynn, was the rudest, most ungrateful  person, with zero customer service.  Especially when she slams the window on you because you asked a question.  She should be fired!!!  Horrible experience at this location!!<//text>

<Text>I was attempting to order the 30 piece fill up bucket online. Upon checking out they said they couldn't get ahold of the Archibald location. So I went ahead and got in the drive-through. When I got up to the speaker I asked if I could order the fill up with a normal bucket of chicken instead of the legs and thighs. I was promptly told know that it would be legs and thighs only. When I asked why it would let me do it on line for no charge I might add, I was told, "that's online."  When I said that the pick up location was here there were crickets on the other side. All I'm saying is if you're offering something on line for picking up at your restaurant, then you should honor what it says on line.< /Text>< gmapID>

The chicken breast i orders was really dinky and dry.  Not good.  I did the survey for the free Sanders sandwich and the next day I went and it was also the smallest chicken sandwich I ever had.  Guess they send all the small stuff to this restaurant.<//Review>

Did not get my order correctly.
I specifically repeated my order again at the window and she advised me that it was correct .Just to come home with an incomplete order.</text>

Repeat your order at least 3 times, get a receipt EVERY TIME, and if they say it will be a few minutes, do you want to wait, SAY NO!! They have no concept of time and my few minutes for 2 chicken littles was 16 minutes!! Terrible customer service</text>

<review>I couldn't believe I paid 5 dollars for this meal. Seriously I over paid, the chicken looked, smelled and yes even tasted bad. Why taste if it looked and smelled bad see the first sentence. The coke hurt my stomach the gravy and mashed potatoes smelled odd. Threw my meal out. Good riddance to bad garbage.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<text>My husband didn't get the right kind of chicken for his meal. My bowl had one chicken tender chopped up instead of popcorn chicken and only maybe a tablespoon of corn. And they forgot the rest of the meal. They forgot my order of biscuits. The biscuit in my husband's meal was covered with syrup. My slider did not have sauce on the chicken but a minor amount on the bun. Completely unacceptable. I will be returning tomorrow to speak with a manager.</text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Slow drive through, even slower inside. Wrong drinks where given to us, they never have the chicken ready, at 12 when lunch has just begun. Go elsewhere.< /Text>

This was one of the best KFCS in the whole state and trust me I have been to many there's a lot of good things and no bad things all the other post are old but here is one from today the food is just the best service is fast and it is clean I ordered a 5$ fill up chicken tenders and a go cup and I got my soda no ice and they gave it to me with no ice u may thing why are u saying this because if u ask for no ice at some other places they may still give u ice and the people that were there were so nice and all had smiles anyway I got my food in about 2 mins and it was so good :)</Text>

I went out of my way to go to this KFC because it said it was open until 11pm I came at 10:20 pm and they were already closed. They should update their hours instead of making people waste their time. What a waste and I didn't even get lunch for work!<//Text>

These guys are absolutely awesome. Cody was a pleasure to work with. I needed my clutch and slave cylinder replaced on my Jeep Wrangler, they not only had competitive pricing but also warranty the work which was surprising to me on a clutch. The job was done within 24 hours of me dropping off the vehicle.< /Review>

<Text>My experience with this AAMCO, and especially working with the owner, Kim, was AMAZING! Kim is AWESOME!! I have had trouble with AAMCO service in the past, and that tainted my perception of ALL AAMCO's, but I learned that it is actually a franchise and each shop is independently owned - this makes all the difference. The shop here in Santa Cruz helped me to understand that, and they were so wonderful to work with.

I needed a new transmission on my van after some time, and Kim answered all of my questions honestly, and with variety - something that is not typical of auto shops who simply want to sell you up. I was given quotes of several different options that were available to me, each with different price points, and all of them were reasonable relative to the nature of the option. They also replaced my window rotary motor, and my back door hatch. I highly, highly recommend doing business with these folks - you won't regret it!</Text>< Pictures>

I have used AAMCO twice in the past 3 months. Both times I received excellent, timely, and affordable service! First, they did a great job replacing the dead transmission on my 2009 Kia. Even though a new/remanufactured transmission is not cheap, I was grateful that Kim (the owner) found one at a reasonable price, and the installation took just two days. Then, just the other day, I brought in my Acura MDX which had a "check engine" light and was running rough. Dropped off at the end of day on Monday... and it was diagnosed, fixed, and ready for pickup by 3pm the next day! Thanks to Kim (the owner) for her friendly and professional service, and to Randy (the lead mechanic) who seems to be a car whisperer!<//Text>

I feel like my experience at aamco transmission in Santa Cruz Ca was a life saving one. Kim was such an amazing person. She gave me a great deal with a good warranty. She communicated with me throughout the whole process. She was kind, accommodating and most of all honest with me. I found her trustworthy cause everything she said was exactly how it happened. Everything was done promptly my car is now working and back in my life running great. I highly recommend Kim and the whole aamco transmission Santa Cruz team.</Text>

Our truck transmission went out on our way to drop our daughter at college over a weekend. No place was open. We had it towed to Aamco in Santa Cruz and made our way home. Left them a voice mail so they knew what the truck was doing there. Spoke to Kim on Monday and she was so very helpful! I can not say enough about the help and service I received from a distance. Kim kept in touch with what was wrong, sending me pictures and repair options. They rebuilt the transmission and we got it back a week later. Just a wonderful, helpful place. I wish they were closer, I’d use them for anything I could!! Thank you to everyone at Aamco Santa Cruz.</review>

My entire experience was superior.  From the moment I called to make an appointment (in fact, I requested my appointment on line), the call back, the professionalism, the explanation of what needed to be done were all super great.  When I went to get the car, at the time promised, it was ready,  The staff was supportive to my questions and the mechanic came and talked to me, as well, as a courtesy, not a forced requirement.  I would truly recommend AAMCO on Ocean Street in Santa Cruz.</Review>

Cody and Kim at AAMCO in Santa Cruz were very helpful to us when my son's car broke down.  They were good at explaining what the error codes were telling them and what they recommended doing to determine what exactly was wrong with it.  They were very up front about the cost of opening up the transmission to see what was wrong.  After they opened it up and gave us the bad news, they explained all of options and costs.  They were very understanding when we told them we did not want to invest the money for a new, rebuilt or used replacement transmission and simply closed up the transmission and held the car for us for a few days to arrange for its pick up.  Again, they were pleasant to deal with, communicative and straight forward.</review>

In a world where it seems that customer service has gone by the wayside, AAMCO on Ocean St. in Santa Cruz, is a steadfast rock of integrity, professionalism and true customer care. The owner Kim recently helped our family with our Suburban’s transmission issue. Having been to another service shop in Scotts Valley and the horrible experience there, AAMCO was a true breath of fresh air! Not only did they treat us with respect and compassion, but they gave us five-star professional service every step of the way.  We were cheerfully greeted, given clear upfront guidelines on how they do their pricing and they communicated with us very step of the way, regarding the repair process. Their professionalism never wavered and we felt that they truly took the time to listen to our concerns, properly diagnose the issue and had their seasoned and expertise staff handle our vehicle with great care. Their communication is second to none. We were kept up-to-date on the entire process and got our vehicle back in a very timely manner. It gives me comfort to know that their staff of automotive professionals, are well versed in a wide variety of vehicle maintenance and repair, as this will undoubtedly be the only shop we plan to take our vehicles to from now on. So, if you are looking for specifically transmission care and service or for complete auto care, look no further than AAMCO Santa Cruz! Thank you again Kim for easing our anxiety and providing us with the much-needed care we were looking for our Suburban. You give us hope that customer service is indeed not dead, on the contrary, it appears to be flourishing at the the shop under your care. You rock!</review>

Really a most excellent experience from the initial call, speaking with Randy, who gave me 10 minutes of his time at the end of the day when he was surely trying to go home - to dealing w/ Kim throughout the entire process of rebuilding my transmission. Bringing all my work here moving forward, thanks guys & please keep it up!!< /Text>

<Text>The engine blew out on my car a while ago. Never got an official reason but suspect it was the oil pump because the oil light came on before it seized. I had a new engine put in at the shop I normally go to but the transmission had a leak afterwards. I took it back a couple times and they didn't do much to fix it. With time the leak got worse and the transmission started making a whining noise. I took it to Aamco to get fixed, and they were super professional about keeping me updated and contacting me before doing any work. Turns out the original shop had hooked a line up from the brake booster to the transmission dipstick to create pressure and keep it from leaking, but instead the extra pressure blew out the pump seal and a few other parts. Aamco got everything fixed and documented what they found in the transmission.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Review>I am so relieved to have found this place. After calling all around Santa Cruz looking to have my collapsed window fixed—and tons of places jumping to conclusions on the diagnosis—AAMCO had a responsible, investigative approach to the problem. They discovered that the part in question was not in fact broken, and only needed a partial replacement, which cut the potential cost in half. Other places were quick to suggest “just replacing the whole thing” without even looking at it, and jumping on ordering a $500+ part. Kim and Cody were very knowledgeable and also really down to earth. I didn’t feel taken advantage of here, which I admit is an anxiety I have with auto body shops. Absolutely recommend AAMCO!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1575655534096, 'text': 'Thank you Lauren for the kind review.

<review>Cody and Kim have gone above and beyond to meet our vehicular needs. Our transmission was going out and needed to be replaced or rebuilt and they gave us the best quote and provided quick and efficient services to have our transmission done in less than a week. We are so thankful for them and their team. We highly recommend their office specifically and will be returning for any transmission or motor needs. Thank you all greatly! :) <3</review>< pics>

Not only are the owner and son friendly and communicative, but also scrupulously honest. I brought in my '99 sedan due to low-speed shifting problems, they did the diagnosis and a pan drop, and then told me "we see no damage - might not be the transmission at all; might be electrical." I was very impressed, and would recommend this AAMCO to anyone.<//review>

Last November I drove from LA to Monterey and San Francisco on vacation. Had car trouble in Monterey. I found an aamco in Santa Cruz. Cody and his crew took my car in right away. Found a sensor problem and was able repair my car in under 2 hours. I was back on the road and in San Francisco before sunset. Thanks to Cody and his crew I enjoyed my trip without anymore hiccups.

After a bad experience with a extended warranty company sending me to the Ford dealer for a bad transmission replacement I was sent to see Aamco. I talked to Cody about it and what a difference. Top-Notch See, Fast, Friendly, I can't say enough about his work and his professionalism. I highly recommended using this place for any transmission work you need done. Cody will take good care of your vehicle. If transmission work is needed in the future I know where to go. Thanks Cody<//text>

If you think you may have a problem, you have to bring your vehicle here. I have been in Santa Cruz for many years and there many ups and downs with auto repairs here. Kim and Cody are awesome to deal with , quick to diagnose and can get your car fixed fast!. Transmissions are of course their specialty, but they are not limited to that. I would bring my vehicle here for anything that I suspect is a problem. If you are from out of town i would highly recommend, as they may be very busy, but are skilled and able to help you out better and faster than anyone I can think of.
Excellent w vintage cars, vanagon and all kinds of vehicles- Easy location and excellent service! Randy is a super tech and he was extremely helpful, as is all of the staff there, very professional and highly recommended!</Text>

<Rate>3< /Rate><Review>I had my Odyssey transmission rebuilt. They did a free assessment and estimate. They offered a competitive price. The rebuild took about 4 days.
Two weeks later the transmission leaked fluid all over our driveway. I took it back in, they repaired it and were very kind about it. 4 Weeks later, it leaked again. The driveway and undercarriage were wet with transmission fluid. I took it back it and it was fixed over night. They also cleaned the undercarriage. They are very kind and helpful. But, I am not thrilled with the quality of the mechanical service provided. I'd give them 2.5  stars, but bumped it to 3 since it's not an option.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

The kindness that Kim and her staff showed to us, was beyond great customer service.  Our transmission line tore,  on the way to show my little handicapped grandson the ocean for the first time.  He had been having a few seizures that morning so we were being careful. We pulled into Aamco and Kim came out and greeted us, we explained our problem and she said don’t worry we’ll take care of you.    Alejandro was wonderful with my grandson and went above and beyond for us.  I would recommend this business to anyone.

Thank you Kim and crew, I will be forever grateful to you.

Good Service, car fixed in a timely manner.
Brought my dodge Caliber to AAMCO Santa Cruz because the transmission was 'whining' in 3-5 gears. Cody got me right in for a test drive, called within 15 minutes and suggested draining the fluid and looking for metal shavings which they found. ($60 service they didn't bill me for).
Cody called me back the next day with my options $3500-$4500 and started working on my car. I was told the car wouldn't be ready until July 5th due to the holiday, but they got the car out early and I had it for the 4th...really great service.
Word of advice, if you have work done and have any coupons make sure to present them before having the work done. I found a $100 coupon on their website and tried to redeem but was told I needed to present it before agreeing to have the work done. Considering I left my car with them and agreed to have work done via the phone, I couldn't have presented the coupon prior to having the work done. I asked if they bidded the job differently if a coupon is presented and was told 'no'. Kim did end up dropping my over-all bill $50.00 but the full $100 on a $3467.00 bill would have been better.
Over all good experience, would recommend them and will do business with them again.

<resp>{'time': 1520450739798, 'text': "Working with extended warranty companies can be confusing and frustrating for the customer. I thought it would be helpful to explain the process....When you have a problem with your vehicle, as this customer has, the first step is to find out if the warranty company will cover the repair. On this customer's vehicle, he had a shifting issue. We offer our initial inspection on the transmission at no charge. Our initial inspection is to test drive the vehicle, check transmission fluid and scan it. After our initial inspection, we felt it necessary to recommend a pan drop. A pan drop helps to see what is happening inside the transmission. In order to do this step, we have to contact the warranty company. Typically, as in this case, the warranty company wants the customer of the vehicle to authorize any additional diagnosis. They want the customer to take some responsibility in the early steps of the process so that, if we are wrong in our dignosis, the customer has to pay for the diagnostic. Once authorized by the customer, if there is a transmission problem, then the warranty company covers the complete repair, including the diagnostic, less the customer's deductible (based on each individual contract). When we dropped the pan on this vehicle, there was metal throughout. This tells us that the transmission is failing. After contacting the warranty company with our findings, they send their own inspector to review the transmission and make a report. The Inspector has 72 hours to come to the center and review the vehicle. The good news is the Inspector's report confirmed our findings. The warranty company searches for a unit or gives the customer an allowance to use towards the repair of their choice. In this case, rather than using the allotted amount to put towards the repair and getting the job done quicker, the customer elected to use the warranty company's supplied unit which took about 10 days and is out of our control. Once the unit was installed and test driven, there was still a drivability problem. This may have been the original cause of the transmission failure. Unfortunately, extended warranty companies take each problem as a separate issue. They told us that the customer would have to authorize additional diagnostic for us to keep going which in this case, was declined. As a courtesy to Mr. Rogers, the Manager reviewed his 30+ page contract in detail, but could not find anything in the contract that would cover the engine problem. He decided to bring it back for further testing and we decided to not charge him an additional diagnostic fee. We found that he was having a misfire issue. On his authorization, we pulled a spark plug and noted that they were completely worn down. They were the wrong spark plugs for his vehicle. Mr. Rogers acknowledged that he wasn't getting that good of gas mileage. When spark plugs are worn to this point, they can send raw fuel through the exhaust and damage the catalytic converters. He authorized us to replace the spark plugs with Motorcraft OEM plugs, but we told him that we could not guarantee this would fix his issue. After replacing the plugs, we testdrove again. It still had a drivability problem. At this point, we recommended that he have his catalytic converters tested at an exhaust shop as we do not perform this type of work. Fortunately, the warranty company acknowledged the transmission damage and covered it even if the cause of the transmission damage is something they do not cover."}< /resp>< Rate>

I give a minus 5 star for there quick trigger.
Brought my van in because is won’t shift while in high RPM’s with hard exceleration. They made me pay a diagnostic test to further look into it.  They said they saw metal pieces & fluid was burnt (ok high RPMs). They told my Ins. I needed a new transmission ( maybe so ,not yet?) they had my vehicle for 3 weeks putting in new tranny .
Kim (mom) with “40yr” experience calls me an says it’s still won’t shift with hard exceleration an that I need to take it to someone else like Ford & pay the Ford dealer to re-diagnose it, and said this might be what’s causing damage to the transmission (dugh,that’s way I’m here) an they added if I can’t fix this I might burn up the new tranny. “The transmission experts double A MCO”. I might of been able to go another 20,000 miles or so on that tranny...
I have taken it back to them after our email conversation. They have had it for a week an talked me into having the spark plug changed now and said this would fix the missing that I now have. $266. And it still misses and this is a new problem  since they gave it back to me. These guys don’t know what they are doing. I also had to pay for a rental that was another $250.  I not only didn’t get my original problem fixed but also didn’t fix a new problem since they gave it back that just costed me another $500.  These guys don’t know what there doing.< /Review>

Terrible service. Out of all the underhanded, shady experiences I've had, this one was the worst. Car broke down half a mile down the street after we picked it up. Kim was so rude and unpleasant, didn't even bother to take it back. Went to Monterey Bay Automotive instead! They were wonderful. Didn't charge for diagnostic. Honest, wonderful guys. Kim, just awful. Apparently the owner of aamco. Boooooo.< /Text>

When I a child said no to meat and green things. With that said yes to native and no to non native. Now grown up, and a bit more wiser understand food is not about gluttony, but all about LOVE. More about discovery and experience than life in a shell in the abundant sea. And this place brings the heart of India into my soul, and it is goo, - step out the boundary of normal and be one with all that's good. Fine dine cuisine.< /text>

<user>117869840117871141435<//user><rate>5<//rate><Review>It’s our go-to place for delivery for Indian food. We usually go through the yelp app which used to own eat24 but now it’s grub hub (they bought eat24 from yelp for $287.5 mil in 2017). Next time though I may call the restaurant directly to see if they would deliver so they can keep more of that money and not have it go to a third party app.

I usually get the saag paneer, chicken tikka masala, samosas. I added rice, naan, lentils, veggie of the day, and raita for an extra $5 per plate.

We have enough food for another meal!<//Review>< resp>

We visited this restaurant during our stay in Los Angeles. Super impressed by the delicious Indian food. We hit this restaurant straight for 4 days. Primarily tried vegetarian food and it's was amazing. The servers and  cook are super nice. One day we had specific requests on how we wanted the food to be made, the chef got in touch and aligned his cooking to our needs. Thank you!</Text>

Best of the best! Not only great, but consecutively great! Every time an amazing  and balanced meal! The staff is always so nice and they are open late! There is no losing with this place! Great vegan options as well. Vegetable curry and the samosas are the best I've ever had. A+. I highly recommend!< /Text>

<review>Fantastic selection of German beer! But don't expect to find any American IPAs. It's also pretty crowded but the wait is worth it! I had the sausage with sauerkraut and potatoes which was underwhelming but my companions ordered much yummier dishes. The best thing to order was the spatzle, a German take on Mac and cheese. Be sure to get it!<//review><user>114868339372446455328< /user><gmap_id>0x80c2c74c4015fd7f:0x4db295e2e5a0ecd< /gmap_id><response>None<//response><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

My favorite for Indian cuisine.  This is the restaurant where I introduced my wife to Indian food.  She still loves it here, especially the papadam.  If it's not chicken tikka balti or chicken mushroom balti, it's chicken sagwala.  Along with saag paneer and garlic naan.  Then the sweet lassi to wash it all down.

We always plan on dessert, but the time we get there we're so full.  Maybe next time.  Gulab jamun.<//Review>

<review>I wish this tasted as good as it looked. It didn't even have any flavor!

Ordered paneer masala(medium spice(aka not spicy at all)), mango lassi (watered down), garlic naan(no flavor), gulab jamun (served ice cold and they were too small), and papad.

Wouldn't recommend this place, as it seems like they don't make any of these items fresh.

Feel free to reach out to my on IG if you want good Indian food recs in LA!

Amazing costumer services and delicious foods. I really appreciate their customer service. Each of them are well trained and well mannered. Buffet is great and high quality compare to price. I highly recommend this restaurant. Pulse it’s a halal restaurant.<//Text>

The butter chicken was yummy!  Enjoyed sitting upstairs in a quiet area with friends celebrating art show and friendship!  The nan bread was really good and loved the toasted bottom with the yogurt cucumber cream. The wine was lovely and the best part was we had fun!< /Review>

The food here is really awesome. We order the 3 different dishes and all of them had authentic Indian flavor to it. I really liked this place. The server was really helpful and did serve with a big smile. If I go to Los Angeles again I will definitely go to this place.</review>

I visited Agra cafe after a meeting I had in the building upstairs. I was hungry and curious about this place and its food. Even though it was noon it was empty. The lady was not necessarily rude but wasn’t nice either. I looked at the menu and was happy to see that it was quite affordable and varied. It took her forever to bring my order and the food, even though I admit it was fresh, was not very good.</review>

One of our favorite place for authentic Indian cuisine in LA. Favorites: Tandoori Chicken, all Vindaloos, meat & cheese Nans'. Nice decor & excellent service. Reasonable prices.. You choose the level of "heat." Recommend 8. You won't be disappointed.</text>

Open until 1am. Great flavor. If you like spicy food, you must seriously emphasize that you actually like spicy. Otherwise, it was authentic and perfect.<//review>

While this place is on the pricier side, I find it to be the best Indian food in the area. Great Naan and the chicken samosas were very good too. It’s open and late and this has become my go to</text>

Food was really good. Coconut Paneer curry was excellent( I heard first time  anything like that and I am glad that I ordered it). Ambience was good and great service. I would highly recommend it.<//Text>

<Text>I don't get how a place like this can have a 4-star rating. Ordered (through Uber eats) tofu masala with basmati rice and garlic naan and was ready to throw up after the first bite. This was literally the worst indian food I've ever had in my life. They clearly don't get how to cook the masala sauce or maybe they just were too greedy to add spices.

Seriously, I want to see the person that tried their tofu masala and said “hey, that tastes good, let’s add it to the menu”. I want my money back!< /Text>< pictures>

The only suggestion I have is to improve the spice levels, especially with the non-vegetarian dishes. I specifically mentioned "spicy" when asked, but the dish ended up real bland.

Barring that, a good place to visit. :)<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

For my taste, their spiciness, texture, and composition is perfect.  The service can be a bit dull, but the food is so delicious that you won't care.  Or, use their online ordering and get take out or delivery.  They do a better job packing up their food to go than any Indian restaurant I've ever been to, so I recommend it.</text>< Resp>

<Review>Good Indian food at a good price. Tried the baltis based on an earlier review and it was great. Nice mix of traditional and nontraditional Indian dishes. Excellent prices, average ambiance. The place was pretty empty on a Friday night, but they appear to do more take out than sit down business.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< rating>

We don't like food coloring, which was in the mint chutney.  Did not like any chutney they had.  We had a fish vindaloo which did not taste good or correct in, any way.  The tandoori chicken was good and cooked well. The naan was extremely flat. I prefer some softness to it.  This was toi thin or overcooked for how thin they made it. South Indian is more our style.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< user_id>

Usually I give 4 stars Imma give them one extra for customer service. Nice and quiet place for a date. Chicken tikka masala, Saag paneer, tandoori Chicken fresh and well prepared  garlic naan was perfectly cooked. Definitely coming back and back<//Text>

If you like the food here, maybe you never have had REAL INDIAN FOOD. Try some other restaurants in and around LA.</Review>

<Review>This is my favorite restuarant. My wife and I order from them maybe twice a month on grubhub. They give alot of truly great tasting food for the price. The other night they had a new delivery guy who got lost and caused our food to be late (not their fault) so being frustrated I left a bad review on grub hub and couldn't delete it after I calmed down. So it's only fair that I leave a great one here. They really are the best indian food around in our opinion and we will be customers for a long time to come. Sorry about the bad review guys I wish I could delete it (grubhub won't let me).< /Review><user_name>Hunter Beard< /user_name>< Pics>

Do not order from this place. Got lamb vindaloo- potatoes were almost raw. When called to complain the staff was rude and hang up on me. 40 dollars for barely edible food?! Should've got a slice of pizza instead<//review>

<Review>The worst place ever. I made an online order and waited an hour and a half and delivery was wrong. I spent $35 and was delivered one small container of their famous dried out chicken tikka. I wouldnt feed it to my dog.I called the restaurant and they were so rude, disrespectful, dishonest and called me a liar.I asked for a refund and they completely refused. They were so rude and have zero sense of customer service. DO YOURSELVES A FAVOR AND DO NOT SET FOOT IN THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Delicious! We were looking for late-night delivery on a Tuesday and stumbled upon this gem in our neighborhood. We took a chance and are SO glad we did! We ordered the chicken tikka masala, garlic naan, and mixed vegetable pakora -- all very tasty. Portions are generous, so we definitely have left-overs after ordering this much for 2. I was even impressed with the gentleman who delivered our food. He was well-dressed and incredibly polite. We'll definitely be ordering from here again.< /review>

Professional, courteous and friendly service!  I've tried two friends to give me a jump start because my car has a 1200amp marine battery.. no dice even after 5 minutes rev charging.
Their truck jump had the car up in running almost immediately.   I will use their service again!< /Review>

<username>Jessica Sotuyo</username><text>I needed a tow when my battery died. I called Toro Road Runners for towing services and they were very polite, gave me an immediate quote (extremely reasonable!). Martin arrived promptly (about 20 minutes sooner than I expected!) and was very nice to work with. I immedietly felt taken care of! Very happy with this towing service! He was happy to answer my questions about how the towing industry works, fascinating stuff! I'm definetly calling Toro Road Runners again if I ever need a tow or a battery jump!<//text></record>

If I could give cerro stars I would.
The worst service I've ever experienced.
Two hours late. The driver called saying he was 5min away. When I called the office and her later they said he must have gone to a different job. The driver showed up to hours later seemingly drunk. When I asked why he was so late. He got furious and drove off.
Terrible company, terrible service< /Text>

On 7/24/2020 . I called for tow at 6:30am. didnt get a truck there till 10:10. After being told all kinds of bs during my wait. heard he will be there in 15 minutes like 8 times. Anyways he finally gets there and I literally got towed 3 blocks down the road to a shop close to home and they tried tocharge me $300. $100 a block are you serious. i complained and they said $250. Their address is on bayshore. thats 2 minute drive from my house.. They should have deducted a hundred for every hour i waited and listen to their lies. If you need a tow. Do not call them. This is the worst service ever. Zero star if i could< /Text>

I'm surprised to have had a bad experience considering all of the good reviews.

Called for a quote. Jessica was really nice. Told them all the details they needed - jumpstarting, parking garage, clearance, and all. Quoted me for $195/hour. Scheduled the towing.

They were 3 hours late. I had a dealership appointment I had to make. They promised me a discount because they were late. I was patient and polite. They were too.

Towing guy arrived. From arrival to drop off, the whole job took 1 hour.

They then tried charging me for 2 hours & "special equipment" (BS for portable jumpstart battery). External towing guy said $390 or $270 (discounted) and told me to choose. I thought what kind of negotiation is that. I refused saying i'll pay for 1 hour only because that's how long it took. He said "so you'll pay 0? Choose $390 or $270." He was being incredibly rude to me.

I called Toro. They worked it out with him and called me back. they said they’ll do $195 including the discount. I said that’s not including discount, bc the 1 hour job (according to estimate quote) should be around $195, so I asked for lower. he said that was discounted bc the actual price should be $2 hundred something. He starts mentioning that it’s a minimum 1 hour job and the job is basically a 2 hour job and they used special equipment (BS AGAIN).

It shouldn’t matter. The job took 1 hour. they quoted me $195 knowing what work I’d need help with. I’m a very detailed person I wouldn’t leave out important information. and then it should be discounted.   But they kept trying to base me off a 2 hour job.

I think Toro needs to improve their communication with their external towing people and not put their losses on the customers.<//text>

<text>Horrible, horrible experience. After multiple calls and lies from Toro my daughter ended up waiting over 3 hours at night on side of road .   She had a flat and needed someone to put on spare. Called Toro because of great reviews.  Guy was nice, took credit card# said 45 min - hour and driver would call.  After 45 min I called back and they said another 60 min!! 45 min later they said arrival time 30-40 min.  30 min later, no one answers phone, goes to fax line.  Finally called AAA, signed her up someone came in 30 min.  After 3 hours Toro drivers shows up very apologetic and said drivers aren't allowed to call but someone should have called her out of respect.  Unacceptable, not to mention unsafe, would never recommend or call them again.<//text>< pictures>

This so called toro bay runner llc towing company charged me 975 $ for a 14 miles tow ! And they don’t even have the equipment I requested that cause my vehicle almost scratched! When I asked how come they charged me this much they said the driver charge 250$ an hour but the lady in the office told me it’s around 300 $ tow ! I asked for reasonable prices they just hanged on me ! And today m filing small claims against them as well! So people who saw this be careful about this happen to you!</review>

< review>
HORRIBLE!!! I have used their service twice this week. The first time they were supposed to come pick up AFTER 10am. The truck showed up unapolegetically at 8:55am and I told them that the destination for the car couldn't accept the car till after 10:30am. The driver said, "you want a tow or not?" I said yes but told him AGAIN that the car could NOT get to it's destination till 10:30. He told he he had to go to the office and he would take the car there first. He didn't. He took the car straight to the shop and I got a call from the shop berating me for dropping it early as they had no room in the garage for it.

Today, I called for service. Arranged for a 2pm pick up from same said shop. They never showed. At 5:15pm the driver calls me and says he's outside my house. I go outside and there's no car. He shows me a text telling him pick up is in the wrong location.

Do NOT trust these wackos. The worst service at a horrible price!!!!!!< /review>

Great food at this Alberto’s Mexican Food and restaurant. They offer quick service and the food is always delicious. They have numerous specials and also do catering.

There is seating for outside dining and the tables were clean.</Text>

<review>First let me say that it takes a lot, either good or bad, for me to take the time to write a review. But the meal I just threw in the trash after only a few bites sure prompted me to do so.  How do you mess up a two taco plate?  The meat in the tacos was burnt crisp, unidentifiable as beef by appearance, taste or smell. And the beans and rice were completely dry almost like eating little chalk bits.  All-in-all just completely nasty.  Albertos used to be okay for getting something quick but boy have they gone downhill over the past few years... I'd rather throw up in a bucket and re-eat it.<//review>< pictures>

If you want real Mexican food this is the place the workers are nice the place is always clean & the food is always the bomb & can't forget always fresh too.

Just had a carne asada burrito.. the meat was not the best.. honestly they are loosing their touch.. I rather go to cardenas market and have ranchera / flap steak burrito. The diesmillo carne/ beef chuck steak meat is nasty if not prepared right.. I'm get heartburn just by thinking about it..< /Review>

This place is literally never open. It's 11:35am on a Sunday morning. Is the dude that "works" here walked out the front door while 4 people were trying to enter. He had a plate of food and locked up shop and walked up the block. Nice. Hope y'all are paying that guy well< /text>

Shell gas station, decent prices. I only come here to fill up my zipcar before I return it. Pull in and out of the lot carefully, people who turn in here from the busy street tend to pull in fast and dont look around before they do so. A lot of close calls while I was here.< /Text>

The staff during the day is very nice I have zero complaints about them because they are always friendly and helpful. Sometimes it is closed down temporarily but that's because there's one person there and since there's no one to keep the store running while they're on lunch or go to the bathroom they have to shut it down for a bit. I've been to this gas station hundreds of times and it's not even that often that I would contain.

The man that works late at night is a whole different story though. He is very rude to customers and for no apparent reason. I've also had my trouble with him as well. He even shuts the station down early and just leaves. He seriously needs to do some work on his people skills because he's going to give the place a bad name if it hasn't happened already. He's literally one of the nastiest people of ever met and I'm from New York so I've had my fair share of meeting with people like that and he can easily compete with some of the proudest and grouchiest I've met over there. He must be from NY because from interacting with so many nice and pleasant people in California and San Francisco I can't possibly believe he's a native with that kind of a poor attitude.<//Text>

What can I say besides that it's an ordinary gas station. It is located in a somewhat higher traffic zone probably due to the popularity of Irving street and all the fun and variety locals from all walks of life enjoy. The four way stop lights and the narrower than average streets can create some chaos getting in and out of the gas station during the  busier hours. The gas station sits right on the corner of that busy intersection so can get a bit cramped since it is a smaller size station. This was my experience during the afternoon traffic hours and by no way am I complaining- just sharing my experience & hoping it may help!<//text>

<Rate>3< /Rate><review>I'm not sure why, but all the workers seem to glare at me with an air of contempt. I've always been courteous and cheerful with them despite the fact that they gave me a fake 20 dollar bill (forgery - counterfeit) as change for a VERY hard worked for $50 bank note. I came back to ask for a replacement and they said no. I have never received a counterfeit bank note at a place of business before, and it doesn't feel good. Anyway, make sure you always check to see if it feels right or not. Not saying that the shell knowingly did this, but just to be careful in general.

<Review>I've been coming to this Meineke for over 10 years now. The service is prompt and courteous. Every time I walk in there I feel like they treat my car like it's a person ! They have great record keeping, and they give your car the attention it deserves. Jason, my main contact person there,  always goes above and beyond to help, and so does everyone else working there. The owner is also a very sweet guy, humble and helpful. He once gave me a ride to work when I had to leave my car there, and he didn't even mention  he was the owner. They are truly your friendly neighborhood car repair shop.</Review>< Time>

I feel like I have a personal company for my car’s needs. They educate me, help me make good decisions about Maintenance, are fair with their prices, and make me feel like I’m a part of their family.  The owner even gave me a ride home and picked me up. Wow, I am so impressed, and grateful to have this company to rely on!!<//Text>

< Review>
Frank & Sal took care of everything I needed for my car!  Scheduling was easy & I was in & out in no time. They call you when the car’s ready for pick-up so you don’t have to wait until the end of the day. Walk-ins welcome & they open the earliest of any oil change spot in town!</Review>

It was great to get a link to view photos of the repairs and future repair work that may need addressing down the road.

The car was repaired quickly and priced fairly - I will continue to use them and recommend others to do the same.< /Review>< Date>

And all the Techs do a great job and if they notice something that needs attention they will point it out and give you a price to fix it, but without any pressure to use them.

<Review>I walked into this business to find 2 men on computers. Man #1 looked at me, I told him my name and reason for service but he ignored me. Man #2 offered to check me in. I went outside to wait but went inside with the windy weather. Man #1 was facing me the entire time. He helped other people but kept ignoring me. 25 minutes after my car was done I then walked over to another man that came up front and asked to be checked out. Man #1 said nothing to me, as if I was invisible. I got checked out, went to my car and found out the mechanic parked my car very crooked and was right up on the door of another car parked next to it. I went back to the office and told the guy that checked me out to come help me, which he did, but Man #1 couldn't care less about me. I will NEVER use this business again!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Review>we love this Meineke!!!! They are thorough, courteous, knowledgeable and HONEST. We took a vw golf to vw dealer and they told us car needed over $5000 worth of work. car wasn't worth much more than that. we were deflated but took it to Meineke for 2nd opinion. They had car 2 days and called us and said we have looked at everything and there is NOTHING wrong with it. I said OMG thank you how much do We owe you. and they looked at me surprised and said, um nothing? we didn't do anything there wasn't anything wrong. I said but what about your time. they told me they didn't feel right charging me when there wasn't anything wrong.
HIGHLY recommend them.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1620831109217, 'text': "Our car care professionals are all about building trust and confidence.

<Text>Do not use this place. Was once a customer but that was completely disregarded when I trusted their recommendation on replacing a part that cost over $700. 2 days after I picked it up, even returned back to the store after picking up as my truck didn’t feel right   And was told there were no issues n my transmission blew up. They simply did not care about our situation as the part they supplied was not faulty. All that mattered were the codes from the computer. The owner didn’t want to chat, even tho when you are on hold you are told the owners care...... He simply did care about my side of the situation and passed in through the manager to come and pick up my truck.
DONT USE!! Go somewhere that values their customers.</Text><Rate>1<//Rate>< userid>

I was able to make an appointment after work to get my overdue oil change. They gave me a discount,  and finished in a timely fashion, rotating my tires for even wear too.  I was the last customer,  so they let me stay in th he warm lobby to wait.
The only thing I wasn't thrilled with was that it did not seem that they took the extra measures due to the Covid19 pandemic.  So i wiped my door and steering wheel with sanitizing wipes and drove home with my mask on and windows down to completely air it out.</Review>

I made an appointment and I thought I made it for the day I went in. Turns out I actually made it for the following day. They went ahead and fit me in and they didn’t have to. They are always so wonderful, kind, professional and efficient when I take my car in. I work in customer service so I know how important it is to make sure your customer leaves happy. They don’t ever try and up sell me with pointless stuff like other auto locations I’ve taken my car to. Or do stuff to my car without my knowledge and try and make me pay for it. Trust me this happens and it’s so wrong, but the guys here don’t do that, I know I can trust them.  I’ve been going to the Ventura location since 2017 and have never had a problem. I will continue to take my car in for services here! If I could give ten stars I would! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️< /review>

The Meineke in Oxnard tried taking advantage of my daughter by trying to charge her $400 to replace her brake pads, no new rotors just pads then smeared oil on her airfilter and wanted to replace it when I just checked it 2 days before she took it into the Oxnard shop for an oil change. Ted is a scandalous little thief who takes advantage of women and older folks.I call this Meineke in Ventura and they said it would be $240 to replace the brake pads. Its nice to see that there is still an honest shop around. I will be giving this shop in Ventura all our business from now on.< /Review>

I called, and Frank said they could handle the oil change at 1:00 p.m. so I showed up a little early, they took it in right away! Awesome! I explained that I had seen a coupon online for a $20 discount and Frank told me he would honor that no problem! The service was quick, efficient, professional, and all th

I’ve been bringing my car (and hubby’s) here for our regular oil changes for years now, we’ve used a few of the others services from time to time as well and this last visit the guys really helped me out in a pinch— my battery gave out when I just happened to be there for an oil change and with only 10minutes to closing they helped me get a new battery in and got me on my way without a fuss. I could have been stranded and I’m so thankful they were there to help me out! Thanks again guys!!!</review>< GmapID>

<Text>I didn’t appreciate that when I came to pick up my car it was left unlocked before I paid for the work being done. I told the representative that it was locked and he kind of gave me attitude and clicked it locked. Also the rest of the time while I was paying it was awkward silence and he didn’t even give me the details about my tires or my car diagnostics. Normally I have positive experiences but this guy was rude and I didn’t feel my business was appreciated. Normally the guys walk me through what they did if my tires were bad or anything like that or when I should get my tires aligned or any problems they might have noticed or if nothing was wrong they would tell me your cars in good shape and we look forward to seeing you next time. This was the first time I didn’t feel appreciated at the car place. I have been coming here for several years with all my many cars and I didn’t not appreciate the experience I had with the sales gentleman.<//Text>< pics>

I have been going to this Meineke for over 10 years nowand I never have to worry that they're going to be taking advantage of me because I am a woman. In fact when I had no job they give me very good discounts to help me out. The guys are like family and they are also caring. This past Friday Bill, the owner, picked up my car from my house so that they could work on it and I wouldn't have to go out. That was such a blessing for me. I would recommend this Meineke to anyone.< /review>

They sent a text message when my truck was ready with pics of what some potential issues were going on with my truck.  Great service and great value.  I will be back for sure!<//text>< Pictures>

I came in for a mandatory catalytic converter issue since my car wouldn't smog.  Frank was so helpful and understood that I had to do it. I brought with me a quote from another local shop.

They did their own diagnostics and found that I needed only half of what the other shop quoted. They saved me $1000.00!

They were on time, my car was clean and they want me to return to do one more check to be sure I will pass the smog test

They do everything. Complete car care. I'll be taking me cars there now for all service.< /Review>

Was seriously overdue for an oil change and a family suggested Meineke in Ventura. Was hesitant always been going to a dealership but there were NO appts. available at the time so I called Meineke.

Jason answered phone, was very polite and understood my urgency and said bring it in! I left my vehicle to Frank who was very polite and professional explaining what would be done since I was a new customer. I ran some errands and conveniently received a text that it was ready. As I came back in, I was met by Jason, gave me my keys, explained what was done and the amount was less then was expected..AMEN!! Thank you Meineke for the great service on my vehicle but most of all for the polite professional customer service that speaks for itself. As I got in my car, I was already referring this establishment to family & friends ~ Returning Customer FOR SURE!!😁👍<//Text>

<Text>First off there excellent service started when I called to make an appointment. When I took my truck in they did my service in a timely manner and WERE STRAIGHT TO THE POINT! They didn't once try to " up sell " so to speak. In fact when I spoke to them on the phone I had originally wanted a tune up and oil change. Once in the shop they actually took me in a total other direction once seeing the truck didn't need a total tune up saving me money right away. No pressure to try and get me to do work on things that were in the "ok zone" so to speak. They did my oil and some other engine treatment that totally fixed the issue I was having. All in all they were honest and there staff was extremely knowledgeable.they Hispanic man working the office was amazing and extremely helpful and knowledgeable, I feel bad I can't remember his name but you will know who I'm talking about when you go in. He also had the mechanic Zach work on my truck who was very very experienced in Toyotas and sent my 250,000 mile 4 runner home running better then it had in yrs. My wife and I dont take our cars anywhere but meineke in ventura ca.<//Text>< pics>

I made an appointment for 4:30 on a Tuesday. I showed up a little after 4pm and they took me right in. They had me in their system from previous work on a different vehicle and it just took them a moment to get my plate and their system had all of this new vehicles details aside from some minor specifics about engine size. The staff at the front desk was welcoming and efficient. I walked down the street to handle some other business quickly and came right back. The car was basically already ready by about 4:45pm and checkout/paying was easy and no pressure. They recommend some things I should have done coming up soon but again, no doom and gloom pressure tactics or anything. They sent me an inspection checklist via text and bam! It was all done and I was driving away before 5pm. Well done guys.<//Text>

Outstanding service. They gave my rig full attention, found a safety issue with the rear differential that I wouldn’t have known about until finding myself stuck. They did a great job on the repair and were courteous and professional. Fully recommend.< /Review>

I only take my vehicles to Meineke on Telephone because Jason and Ted are the most trustworthy mechanics I've ever worked with.  Take it from a guy that does a lot of his own automotive repairs to save money, these people are PROS!  Best part is that each of them take a little extra time to develop a relationship with you by listening and validating your situation....what other mechanic does this and saves you money?  If you are in a tough spot, they will help get you up and running again with compassion.  Don't waste your time or money going anywhere else, everyone deserves to have a neighborhood Mechanic like these guys!

11-17-19: wanted to add to my previous review...once again Meineke saves my life and wallet! Matthew and the team we’re amazing and willing to work with my budget. Even got me some reward points toward future free oil changes for both my vehicles!  Not to mention free headlight scratch removal of my foggy headlamps! I’ve said it before, don’t waste your time or money going anywhere else!!< /text>

I took my car and I don’t know much about quality of the job but car is running smoother again after oil change. I waited in waiting area and watched customers come and go after talking with the guys at desk, always friendly, polite and professional. I used a coupon so the cost of oil change less than $30!<//Review>

< review>
I had an appointment for an oil change, and was told it was going to take just a little longer since they were “backed up”. I asked how long it would take and they didn’t tell me and told me they’d call me when it was ready. I came back over an hour and a half later because it had been a while and they never called me.  I was fine with waiting a little, but would have liked a call like I was promised so I didn’t have to wait forever.<//review>

<review>I've been coming here for years! Respectful shop! Not pushy for extra services, they do the work that's agreed, nothing more, nothing less.

They understand we're all on a budget, and spend the time to look for the most affordable prices for parts.

I send friends and family here often. The Owner Bill, Ted, Lisa, and Jason have always serviced my vehicles knowledgeably, and honestly. They know the value of customer service and repeat customers.

Best shop in the county!<//review>< Pictures>

I've been getting oil changes here for a few years usually with an appointment. I've always got great service so when I noticed I was leaking fluid and the transmission was acting funny, I took it to Meineke's. They diagnosed the problem and replaced a leaking transmission line. It was a labor intensive job which took over a day to repair.  Frank, the employee I interfaced with, did an excellent job of working with the warranty company and getting me a car rental (included in warranty). So far I have not noticed any problems with the transmission. If I do, Frank told me to bring it back and they will repair whatever is necessary and include it in the same warranty job so I wouldn't have to pay the deductible again. I would recommend them as a repair shop.

As a follow on, I did return the car because the transmission was not shifting well. They diagnosed and fixed the problem at no cost. Great job!</Review>

<text>The guys at Ventura Meineke took great care of me. During the poring rain I was hydroplaning on the freeway on my way from San Diego to Santa Barbara. I got off in Ventura and looked up Meineke. They were able to put on two new front tires in about an hour. Then I was back on the road. Thank you Meineke of Ventura!! 🤗</text>< Name>

I've been taking my car to Meineke for about two years now. They have great customer service and they are honest in all of their dealings. I've never been upsold or told that I need something that was unnecessary or not due yet. I've worked with Lisa and Jason in the past and they're both really sincere people. While I maintaining your car is never something to look forward to, I do look forward to dealing with Meineke Ventura in the future.<//review>

Always get an honest assessment on the car and their prices are very fair. I've shopped them and never beat their price.
Easy walk to lots of shopping kills 2 birds.

They tend to get busy so take advantage of the appointment system. Ted and Jason are who you will deal with, 2 of the NICEST guys you will ever run into. They always take the time to explain everything and answer all the questions.
BTW- I have 5 cars so I speak from experience, they service them all.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

I have never had an issue with meineke until yesterday. Had an appt at 10. Dropped off at 945 left with kids was told only 2.5 hrs turned into 4 hours. I left and had to go back bc the alignment was off n spent another 2 hrs there. Which stuff happens BUT the tech doing my car had no respect for my car. He used his dirty oily gloves in my car. Ruining my steering wheel cover got my car all dirty. I had to ask them to put the air caps back on. I just felt after me spending so much money n had to go back n all I got was oh sorry then to find out after driving getting my hands dirty n had to throw out my steering wheel cover they should of had more respect for my things.<//Review>

This place is the best, I can't even begin to tell you how many places I've been that are sloppy, underhanded, and and do shoddy work, this meineke is as professional and honest as I've seen in my 65 yrs of living. Excellent mechanics, top end equipment, and Lisa who runs the front office is very well versed in all areas of auto repair, pleasent, and .Looks to make sure the job is correct. These are good people.<//review>

Excellent mechanics, top end equipment, and Lisa who runs the front office is very well versed in all areas of auto repair, pleasent, and .Looks to make sure the job is correct. These are good people.<//Review></record>

My experience each and every time I need car service at Meineke Ventura is exceptional. I am treated with courtesy and professionalism from the moment I am greeted by their first employee.  The quality of service is outstanding and I praise their entire staff for job well done.  I highly recommend their service for any of your car needs.</review>

<Review>These guys rock! i amhaving trouble with my car window. Which they quated me at 30 bucks less than the other cheaper places but 300 less than the guys i used to go to. The problem wasnt what we thought but, instead of saying oh well and adding to the bill we worked out a way to get it fixed at no extra cost cause the situation was so strange. I cant tell you what it means to me and my family to have people on your side like this. Its tax season and instead of trying to squeze money out of me cause i might have extra felt amazing. Especially when we have a child coming in july. And when it took a little longer than expexted they patched the problem real quick so i could pick my daughter up. Ted is the man responsable and i cant thank him enough. Plus while waiting they had a lot of customers and they seemed to always do the best by them helping anyway they could. Thanks guys<//Review>< Date>

Unfortunately, you had your nephew install the used engine in your driveway and Meineke doesn’t warranty work that’s not done in our shop or parts purchased elsewhere. I have no idea what condition your used engine was in before your nephew installed it or your nephews mechanical ability that is required to install an engine. He apparently didn’t do the job properly and his mistake cause your engine to fail. When you brought it in after he completed the installation of the engine. Your request was to check for an exhaust leak and diagnose the check engine light. We fixed the exhaust leak and that cleared the codes. We never touched any of your nephews work and he apparently didn’t completely tighten one of the hoses and it popped off. Meineke isn’t responsible for another persons work. When you and I spoke, we talked about what happened and even though the situation is sad, I didn’t hang up on you. We take pride in doing the right thing all the time. I’m so sorry your vehicle continues to have issues but Meineke Car Care didn’t install the engine or hoses on your vehicle.'}</resp>< GmapID>

They make a listing of things they notice and take the time to explain to me what those things mean in priority to my car. Very friendly.</review>

<review>Been going to Meineke in Ventura for two years. Wonderful people who CARE about clients without being exorbitant! The engine on my 2010 Impala has a strange subtle hiccup where the RPM meter fluttered now and then. They kept after it (the last session for free) and it appears gone! The owner, Bill Edwards, and his manager, Jason Turner gave me personal attention – plus all of their staff.
Try it. You’ll like it!<//review></record></dataset><record>

Just stopped in today to see if Meineke could repair my stuck fuel door. The guy working the floor immediately offered to come out to the parking lot and take a look. He spent 10 minutes trying to figure out how to affix a spring component that would work so that I could avoid the hassle and cost of going through the lexus dealership. He rigged something with an old spring that did the job. I offered to pay, but he just said, "Happy holidays."

I didn't catch his name, but he was working the floor around 11am 12/19/14. If I need any minor work, I will come back to this spot because of this guy. Owner or manager should give him some props!< /Text>

<Review>Its hard to find a place of business that has both great service and a great price combination. Usually you have to sacrafice one for the other. And Ventura Meineke they've managed to do this with a wonderful personal touch. They make me feel like family from the time I enter the door till the time I leave the establishment. Ted usually is the first personel that greets me and I completely trust him with my car. He seems to actually care and never tries to over-sell products which is quite refreshing in this day of the "take advantage of the customer" age. Ventura Meineke is a friend.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80e852a861ee28f5:0x2252bfe032cc9d95< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I went to Meineke in Ventura (4519 telephone rd) for a standard oil change on 4/29/2014 with 178,026 miles. After driving my vehicle for a couple of months (10/16/2014 with 182,826 miles on odometer: 4 800 miles since my last oil change) I noticed my car lossing power. Immediately, I begin to try to get off the freeway to address the issue but my engine began to knock, shut down and I threw it into neutral and coasted off the freeway. I was able to get a mechanic to look at it and was informed that I did not have an oil filter. (as my oil filter fell off) The mechanic said, that the oil filter should not come off under any conditions and that it fell off likely due to poor installation (striped my filter and car ) and that I should reach out to the company that last did my oil change. I reached out to Bill Edwards (owner of ventura Meineke) and wanted to find a resolution. However, he would not stand behind his work and offered poor excuse for his work and ultimately telling me I can not prove it so it was not his problem. I reached out to the Bureua of Automotive Repair and the Better Business Bureau to no avail; short of small claims I do not have any recourse. I would not recommend this place at all. His poor work destroyed my car! Go at your own risk! Also, look at his BBB profile he has been writen up by multiple people in the last couple of months. Save your car dont go to this place!</review>< rate>
