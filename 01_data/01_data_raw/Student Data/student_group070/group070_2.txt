<username>Alan Resnick</username>< review>
Asked for a "deep clean" and was charged accordingly. It was the worst clean I have ever had. Mya responded and sent "great cleaners" to make it right. Wrong. They, too missed much, and not only that; one set of the cleaners damaged the face of our expensive, double door refrigerator. I don't know what they used but it's permanently streaked. I use a truck when cleaners come. I put some dental floss in a bathroom trash can. Still there after both sets of cleaners finished. Many other things not even dusted, after I pointed them out to the second set of cleaners. They were a joke but unfortunately, the joke was on me.< /review>

My son and daughter-in-law moved out of their one-bedroom apartment. They had used Mya before and liked them so I said I would gift their moving clean out. The two women did a good job. They were prompt, efficient and very pleasant.
But after they left, I felt that the kitchen floor could have been cleaner. I was flicking little pieces of dirt off with my fingernail! Maybe it needed another go over. Overall, it was a fine job. The customer service is great! They’re a bit pricey (with added tip) but I didn’t do much research into other services and their reviews were good.< /text>

I want to compliment Agda for cleaning my home.  She arrived as scheduled and brought in all the tools and cleaning materials that she required.  She was thorough and cleaned everything.  She was neat and placed everything back, but in a neater placement, so I had no trouble finding everything.  I was especially thrilled that she cleaned all the kitchen surfaces so well.  On her way out, she cleaned the stoop and shook out the welcome mat.  She also dusted surfaces that I would not even have thought of.</text>

Camilla and Carlos were terrific! Our house has NEVER been cleaner and best of all it stays clean! They were very personable and respectful, even with our little cat and they did a tremendous job getting our house super clean. I recommend them very, very highly. Mya Cleaning Services LLC was recommended to us by our next-door neighbor and we are thrilled with the ease of booking, professionalism and great work!< /review>

<rating>4<//rating><review>Amazing! This was my first time having my house cleaned by someone else and I will definitely be going back again and again. Leonardo and Patricia were great. There was a little bit of a language barrier but they had an app and we were able to communicate just fine. They did an incredible job cleaning our house. I am pretty sure it wasn't even this clean when we moved in. I would recommend this to anyone who's even thinking about getting a professional house cleaner.</review>< pictures>

I've used Sparkling Clean Agency many times and am very pleased with the results. I've had a different cleaner pretty much every time but I usually wait to book with only one or two days notice, and they are always available. Sandra cleaned my house this week and did a fantastic and thorough job, and was really friendly. I like that you can book as infrequently as you like, and the price is reasonable.<//review>

Our family has been using Heather's Home Cleaning for several months now and it has been a wonderful experience.  Isabel cleans our home on a biweekly basis.  She is such a sweet person, always polite, punctual, and does an immaculate job.  At the beginning of every visit she checks in with me to see if I have any specific requests for that day's cleaning.  I have pretty high standards for house cleaning and I have found my expectations met and exceeded every time.  Besides the large tasks, she pays attention to the details: corners are dusted, mildew in the cracks of plumbing fixtures are cleaned, the grills on the stove top are soaked and washed, she even takes time to vacuum the sofa and get those crumbs that always get left behind by my kids.  My house is left sparkling.</Review>

I've been using Heather's Home Cleaning for about 6 months.  She is very professional as are the people who work for her.  Her prices are fair for the work done and I have been completely satisfied with my once a month home cleaning.  She likes to try and have the same person stay with your home but it that is not possible due to scheduling or whatever, than another competent person will come.  Heather has been great about checking in with me to confirm our appointments and see if I am happy with the cleaning.  This month she worked out for me to have the particular day that I wanted.  She is very good with customer relations.<//review>

We have been using Mya Cleaning Services LLC for about 3 months now and they are absolutely wonderful!  Our housekeepers, Rhaissa and Sebastiano are ALWAYS on time if not a bit early and always wear shoe protectors that keep our carpets clean.  They do a very thorough job cleaning art, appliances, under the beds, under carpets, everywhere!</Review>

This cleaning agency is AMAZING!! I hadn't had a proper cleaning in awhile and was referred to this company by a friend of mine. Izabel and Israel came over and WOW. They are an INCREDIBLE team. They go the extra mile moving furniture and providing small touches that are white glove service like a 5 star hotel. I would highly highly recommend them to anyone!</review>

Thank you Alessandra and Leandro for your attention to detail and happy nature. Every time I see them they are always smiling.  In the past I tried several companies and I was never satisfied . I am very picky as I like to keep my home very clean and organized. So I only needed someone to come help for about an hour and a half twice a month. Because  my place is not that big and I keep it pretty clean. They give me exactly what I ask for every time!!!! So grateful for you guys.</review>

Heather and her team have been a Godsend! I've always hesitated to get a regular cleaning lady because I'm cheap and would rather spend our money traveling and eating out, but it turns out that both my husband and I also hate cleaning, so rather than endure yet another argument about who is going to do the dishes or clean the bathroom, the good man took matters into his own hands and arranged for some help. Heather's service is so convenient because I can just text her to schedule a cleaning, and the prices are very reasonable. It's the best feeling coming home to a clean home so our toddler can start rolling all over the floor again, and I don't need to start swiffering around her frantically trying to save her from the dirt. Best household decision we've made!<//text>

What a difference Mya Cleaning Services LLC makes! Had been looking for a reliable service and their booking process is so convenient and they have great reviews. We read great things about Sheila & Diogenes, and they arrived on time and did an amazing job. Sheila and Diogenes were efficient, thorough and so pleasant! Booking my next appointment!</review>

<text>We've booked general cleaning services from Sparkling Clean 3x now, and though every cleaner has been extremely thorough, Dayana impressed us like none other. She meticulously cleansed and polished every square inch of our kitchen & living room, and turned our bathroom into a pristine sanctuary. She stayed for 7 hours, despite having to move her car every 2 hours with metered parking. This level of dedication is just unheard of!!</text><userid>110146007137552647342< /userid><rating>4</rating>< Gmap_id>

I have been using Heather's Home Cleaning Service for a few years now, and am always satisfied with the results.  And, even when I haven't been perfectly satisifed, Heather works with me so that I am, either making an adjustment in the charge or sending someone back for a redo.  Lastly, she is frequently in touch when I am wanting to schedule and in touch right after.  Given that I use the service sporadically, her consistency makes things easy.<//review>

For someone who usually does their own cleaning, hiring a company to come into my personal space and spruce everything up made me hesitant. But, I've been extra busy and can have Monica Gellar expectations of cleanliness. Then came in Sparkling Clean Agency...< /text>

<text>I am so lucky that I stumbled across this great company! I was panicking b/c my apartment was a mess and I was moving out. I called them and they were able to get someone out in less than 24 hours! They stuck their original quote and there weren't any hidden fees or anything. Maid did such an amazing job cleaning from top to bottom, she was polite and friendly too. They even gave me tips to help keep my place clean in the future. I passed my final inspection with flying colors (got my security deposit back) and I owe it all to Mya Cleaning Services! The owners followed up with me the day of and the day after to make sure everything was satisfactory. I've never encountered such a customer service oriented company in Los Angeles that was so friendly, hospitable, professional, and overall fantastic! You can't go wrong with Mya Cleaning Services- you'll have an immaculate home and a smile on your face! Now I only wish they moved with me to Minnesota! I will definitely recommend them to all my friends! Thanks Mya Cleaning Services!!!!<//text>< Pics>

They did a good job for the kitchen and bathroom! Windows shined again! Two hours are pretty short for first time.  Thank you for saving my back pain for cleaning up all these!<//text>

We moved out of our 1BR/1B in SF last week and Alessandra and Celso from Sparkling Clean did our move out cleaning. We were completely impressed by their thoroughness and professionalism - every cupboard, drawer, etc was cleaned thoroughly and the place looked fantastic for our handover.<//Text>

I have used Heather's Home Cleaning Service for regular home cleaning over the last few months.  My rating of this service is a 5+ stars or more.   I would say in general if you asked me - how did I like the service, I would say Excellent or Wow!   They go above & beyond other services.< /review>

<review>I will say that Mya Cleaning Services had had the best customer service that I've ever dealt with. They have offered and outstanding level of customer service to my tenants in the building and to us the managing partner for the owners asset. Manager has always provided me the level of service that I expect. They have always been on time and always have communicated with me with their service.</review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Very satisfied! I ordered a move out deep cleaning for our loft. Three lady came and they did a very thorough work. They cleaned every spots such as the toilet, cabinets. It was so clean that I don't even want to run the water in my sink to destroy their clean work. Glad I support the business and their work was very satisfying.</Text>

Best house cleaners around!  My Husband found them on G+ and we tried them out based on the reviews.  We were not disappointed.  It's been a few months now and we are so happy that we found them.  Antonio and Veronica are friendly, reliable, are trustworthy and they do a fantastic job cleaning.  Well worth the cost.<//text>

<text>I've been looking for something like this for a while. It's trustworthy and efficient and I appreciate the hard work they put into what they do. I'm usually really picky about what I use or who I let into my home but they were great and respected my home and belongings. Definitely worth the time and money. It was money well spent!</text></record>

I've been using them for over a year and would recommend them 100%!  Really easy to communicate with (they'll even do text), and very accommodating  whenever I need to change our biweekly schedule or add an extra cleaning in.

I always work with their team, and am constantly impressed with how cleaning girl remembers our preferences each week and how spotless the place is when her team is done. She always tries to accommodate any special requests, like sweeping the patio, and let's me know if she needs to stay over and charge more for those as soon as she can. Definitely some of the best cleaning teams I have ever worked with.</Text>

<Review>Exceptional service. From the initial communication with Gloria to the willing and humble ladies that came to my house, they left me feeling very satisfied with the condition of my home. My house is already very tidy, no dishes or laundry to do. I just needed a deep clean and they got every crevice in my apartment. Totally worth it and I will definitely use them in the future.</Review></record>

Great service! Professional, prompt and friendly, the trifecta of good service. It's so nice to come home to a clean apartment when you've got a MILLION other things to do and barely have time to keep things tidy.

<text>Very Happy with the service. The House cleaner came on time and cleaned everything wonderful. Felt like I had a new place. She was able to clean my teenage daughters bathroom and clean up and make her bed.. That area is usually a disaster. My kitchen is sparkling and so is my fridge. I will be using their services again.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>Best cleaning service company around. Their maid came right on time and finished the work early. My apartment was a mess but now it's so clean it's unbelievable. I'm never calling anyone else to deal with the dirty work, they've gained a customer for a very long time. Thank you very much Mya. See you in two weeks.</review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<Review>I decided to try Mya Cleaning Services and am happy I did. From the time I called them to the actual service being done they were responsive and answered all of my questions. I am so glad they sent Neomi! She was detail oriented, hard working and did a great job. She brought a huge bag of cleaning supplies, a vacuum and mop. She vacuumed, cleaned every nook and cranny on the floor, did the dishes, cleaned the countertops, toilet, sinks and scrubbed the stove white! She even cleaned all of our windows, mirrors and the inside of our fridge.  I'm so glad she came. She did a great job. On top of that she was very friendly and asked if she could do anything more or better at the end. I will definitely use them again because of her!</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<review>Litterally the worst service ever. Waited on hold for more then 2hours. Keep getting transfer and hung up on repeatedly. When I asked if she would take down my number in case we got disconnected She said no. I will not call you back. You can call and wait on hold again. With 45min wait time if the automatic system doesn't click on you first.  All of this to find out they can't do what I needover the phone "due to covid" . Their whole system is a joke right now.< /review>< Pictures>

The family court mediator's seem more towards the woman's favor in the majority of case's I listened to..... sad.   Get over to the self help center in downtown Riverside for all types of help & info to help you with your case...for Men & Women!</review>

<review>I’ve been here at least 6 times for mediation and/or family law issues and every time I have gone to fight for my rights as a father the courts justify my daughters mom choices. She constantly violates the court order with impunity but when I file an order to show cause the judge sides with her. I agree with the person on here that posted this court house is very bias towards mothers.</review>< pics>

I read the reviews before going. Surprised to say I got there around 8:20am and was in and out quickly on a Thursday. The woman at the window was thorough in the information she provided. Gave clear instructions. I left without questions. I will say I'm discouraged in the process although it's the justice system and not the staff.< /Review>

<review>Worse staff ever! Impolite, lazy, entitled and outright rude. Was there waiting over an hour before they closed at 4 and kicked everyone out. The staff at the windows stop taken people around 5-10 mins before they kick everyone out. They just sit there twirling their thumbs for the last few minutes hoping they dont have to take one more person.  The security detail believes they are swat, chasing me down the hall and yelling to take my hoodie off my head after walking threw metal detector and a wand search. Acting like everyone should just know ALL their special rules that you can put your hat back on but not your hood. Then expect to be followed around and get checked up on several times to make sure you're still in line.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Keep up the good work! They need to hire you all some more help, you guys deserve it.  Even the civilian security guards and the Sheriffs Deputy that was on duty at the front door also had great attitudes!</text>< Name>

T E R RI B L E!!!! My first visit to Hemet.. I live in Lake Elsinore, after visiting Murrietta , I was directed to Hemet to complete my process.  I waited for over 1 1/2 hours, at 4 pm we where told we are now closed,  if you are not at a window come back tomorrow. I drove 32 miles, on my day off,  waited for over 1 1/2 hours, my number was next.. to be told come back tomorrow to start over again. To make matters worst.  Worst service ever!</text>

Deny my right to file one more time or the next letter you're going to receive is a summons complaint lawsuit! in fact, I am going to make several public records request on all traffic tickets so I can compare how your court disproportionately sentences Blacks and Latinos to White people for the same offenses. I am going to prove my point. Mark my words. Better yet, I am going to reach out to the U.S. DOJ Civil rights division and pitch them all the evidence and let them address you.<//Text>

Fourth time coming in waiting for hours to be seen, so unfair! As soon as it hits 4 the deputies kick you out. People leave and they repeat numbers 4 to 6 times. Not alot of windows open for the mass amount of people.<//Review>

Let's see the guards at front were the only thing good I can talk about..As the cops are here ,the judge in civil court Cathlene jacobs wasn't even listening to our side of our eviction case..She never sworn us in as it stated in the minutes order online after..We rent a home in which for past 6 months have had mold black inside our walls .downstairs carpet,and basically all through the house due to a leak from upstairs drainage pipe that is broken in 2 places and leaked for a awhile before it finally surfaced and came pouring out are lower closet..we told our landlords and they did nothing so I held the rent .long story short we had city investigate it,a real contractor and had samples sent to a lab in Florida to see if it was harmful mold.all of us had gotten real sick from symtoms that were the same your get from mold..we had outlets electrical that were bad.had to run extension chords in my house...but results being mold was toxic and our manager lady lied.the judge let her and her lawyer speak but when it came to us she was rude cut us off and didn't let us submit evidence.If we could have afforded a lawyer we would of had a chance but were a family of 6 and my lady's ex that she had the kids with us granted no child support to be paid.That's another issue with guess whom?Yes this lovely justice system they have here in hemet.He's just lazy and your more than typical dead best dad and they seem to be related to the judges and cops here, there all lazy and have no common sense or ethics.go to hell all of you crooked ass,lowlifes. We are appealing and hopefully can get a fair trial..this was a total disgrace and like the law enforcement here are totally a bunch of in competent people in positions that shouldn't be..I always called hemet the armpit of the world for a reason it just proved itself.law and rights?yeah not here..pathetic and byast.oh it's a commissioner not a judge that overseen our eviction so I apologize douche bag Catherine Jacobs my bad I guess I should of listened like u did in our case..Thanks again to you supporting douche bag landlords whom lie,break laws,don't care bout repairs and safety of our kids n there health,but just bout that cash ...we had for year and half always paid our rent and wanted nothing for free.we had rent money butcouldnt pay them anymore ,when we 5 months no 6 months ago had told them before we signed about issues and repairs.we followed up a month later than 3 months than before Xmas I was having family over, and still no acknowledgements or even care to come and look at the mold.damage and the havoc it has caused us..but the judge was so determined all ready before we even got to plead our case(i mean tried to and was always cutoff and or not allowed to represent facts ,evidence , and we d of been better off explaining our case to Stevie wonder ...what ms.Jacobs you can't make it as a judge,?so you .are low-level and crooked commisioner..oh don't rent from the atiyas Dr.there just bad business and horrible landlords that don't even have there supposed to be. Rental license to rent legally here..nice< /Review>

Great little place.  Drop in for a game of pool and check out the jukebox.  Full bar, drafts, and food from the restaurant next door is excellent.  Service is impeccable too.</Text>

(Translated by Google) They open when they want, two weeks ago they crossed before 5 pm and it was already closed, on Saturday they did not even open and today they denied me the delivery of my packages because they could not use the box to charge me for system failures. Also, they lose packages, I have seen people delivering packages that were delivered to them by mistake. Very slow service too.

(Original)
Abren cuando quieren, hace dos semanas cruce antes de las 5 pm y ya se encontraba cerrado, el sábado ni siquiera abrieron y el día de hoy me negaron la entrega de mis paquetes porque no podían usar la caja para cobrarme por fallas del sistema. Además se la pasan perdiendo paquetes, yo misma he visto a gente entregando en caja paquetes que les fueron entregados por error. Servicio muy lento además.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) When I started using it it was good service, but lately I have done more than an hour to pick up a package with only 4 more people in front 😣 and out of nowhere they raised 4 dlls per package.

Very good service. I needed a toilet installed and these people came in less than a day, and installed the toilet in less than an hour. They’re very nice people, that cooperate very well. I recommend them if you need any type of plumbing service!</text>

Had a leaky valve in our watering system and a 75 year old water line.  Jonathan fixed both and worked very long and hard to make sure we had water even with his daughter”s birthday part.  Would highly recommend!</Review>

Jonathan and Jesus are awesome!!! Not only they're good and knowledgeable at what they do, they're also nice, polite and honest people. I called them 3x for 3 separate problems in a span of 2 months and they were always helpful each time and made things a little less stressful for me. Didn't leave the job unfinished even if they had to work really late..Hard working guys! Always willing to help out! Can't thank them enough. I now have a "go to guy" for future repairs and projects. Would 100% recommend!<//review>

I needed my shower doors repaired and called Mid Valley Services to see if they could fix them.  They were incredibly fast to respond - Mr. Fernandez came out to my house the same afternoon to evaluate the problem.  He and his team came back next morning - they were able to fit me into their schedule very quickly which I really appreciated - and resolve the problem within an hour.  They were incredibly professional - ensured that the problem was resolved, cleaned the area afterwards, and provided instructions on maintenance.  This is a great service and I highly recommend them.  For any future needs, I will be going to them only!!</text>

<Text>Wow !  As a Marine my expectations and standards are a staple  for me when selecting and having people perform any sort of customer service and maintenance for me and my family. Jonathan has set a bar that I truly believe will be hard to surpass, I don’t know many people that will answer a call at 1030 pm after a long hard day of work, just finishing dinner with their own family for a complete stranger, Jonathan did that for me. I was having an issue with my kitchen sing and to some Businesses it could of waited 24 hours but for MVRS my emergency was considered their emergency as well, Jonathan was here within 30 min and greeted me with a smile (mind you it was close to 11pm) . The work, The customer service and his determination to not let his customers down is admirable. I will save this Business in my contacts and will be utilizing them for all my plumbing needs. I apologized to Jonathan for having him come out so late and his exact words were I LOVE WHAT I DO !

Thank you Jonathan!

God Bless You and your Family.</Text>< Response>

<Review>We had our shower drains back up with water; which lead me to understand that our septic tank was full and needed to be pumped. Jonathan was responsive on Sunday and got us pumped out the same day. Then we came to understand the main drain from house to septic tank was clogged as well. They did an excellent job and are courteous and helpful. Price was reasonable. This is a good vendor to call for plumbing issues that was very helpful to my family.</Review>< Name>

I had a pretty bad leak coming from my water heater and Jonathan was able to talk me through over the phone the steps I needed to take to stop the leak safely so I can protect my home from damage. I ended up having to replace my water heater and Jonathan was able to come out the same night and get the job done. Pricing was spot on too.

If you’re looking for an honest company that is locally owned and operated with wonderful customer service Mid Valley Rooters is it! Jonathan is very knowledgeable and will help you save where possible. I had a water heater issue and called him at 9:30pm and he came out first thing in the morning to work on it. Not only did he install a new unit he helped us understand how the unit worked and how to maintain it ourselves. We’d highly recommended Mid Valley Rooter Services.< /Text>

We had both our toilets backing up and none of the showers were draining, with our floors flooding. It was horrendous. They showed up on New Year's Day at 11pm and fixed everything super fast. Very courteous and helpful. And the pricing is fair. Will call again :)</Review>

Recently, I needed plumbing help——my kitchen faucet was broken, and the angle stop, the line into my faucet, and the dishwasher supply line were all leaking. After getting two estimates that I couldn’t afford, I called Mid Valley Rooter Services and scheduled that same day with Jonathan. He gave me a free estimate, a fair price, and told me I could lower the cost by buying the faucet myself.

I went to Home Depot and found a mid priced faucet that was still more than I could pay. I asked the woman helping me if I could have the sale price of a similar model that was only online, and she gave me $30 off! That likely wouldn’t have happened if I hadn’t bought it myself. I met Jonathan back at my house where he fixed the issues and installed my new faucet. Now, my sink is in good, working order, with a one year guarantee!

Jonathan is a positive person with good vibes. He did an expert job and it’s good to know that if my house has future plumbing issues, I know someone trustworthy and professional, to call.<//review>

<text>We recently purchased an older home and had issues with our water heater leaking. We had already had another plumbing company come out a month ago and all they did was replace a valve. We had the same problem only a couple weeks later but it has gotten worse. We called a DIFFERENT company to take a look at it and they said it needed to be replaced but wanted to charge us an arm and a leg just to replace the tank itself. So my husband called Mid Valley Rooter and Jonathan was able to make it to our house within a couple of days. He not only replaced the water heater but replaced some of the piping that the previous owner had put in himself that wasn't up to code (which we already knew some of it wasn't). Jonathan was very polite, very knowledgeable, very thorough and made sure that he didn't leave until the job was 100% complete and all of our questions were answered. We would highly recommend Jonathan and Mid Valley Rooter to anyone needing ANY plumbing assistance. I know that WE will be using him for ours. Thank you again Jonathan!< /text><date>1592442218331<//date><gmapID>0x80952fc5c9889ea9:0x45a6b55d3a4b6513< /gmapID><Rating>5</Rating><name>Lisa Fernandez< /name></record></dataset><record>

I had a broken pipe and couldn’t get anyone to come out and check it. I called Mid Valley Rooter and Jonathan Fernandez got here within an hour. When Jonathan was on his way he kept me updated on his arrival time once he arrived he was very respectful and friendly explained the problem and how he was going to fix it. He finished the job at a reasonable time and a respectful price very happy with his work would recommend him to anyone and will be using him again. Thank you Mid Valley Rooter</review>

The gentleman named Jonathon who came out and helped us was very helpful, friendly, and got to us right away before my ceiling was completely flooded. I will definitely be calling in the future for any other plumbing services!!</Text>

<Text>I would definitely recommend Mid valley rooter services. I had a Water leak in my attic and needed repairs made quickly.Jonathan came out and gave me a free quote on the repairs needed, other plumbers will charge you $40-$60 just to come out and look. He gave me a fair price and made the repairs efficiently. He even gave me a 15yr Warranty on the repairs he made.</Text>< pictures>

Very friendly and happy to do his job, he explained everything to us as he went along and gave us a very reasonable price considering we had a leaky shower, leaky faucet, and leaky toilet for him to fix that were all outdated and wonky. He was diligent about getting things fixed and was even quiet enough to not wake up our sleeping baby.</review>

My toilets and shower clogged up and for three days I was unable to use them. I got in touch with Mid Valley Rooter Services and Jonathan came to the rescue. He looked at the problem and gave me a quote which he honored. That in itself was remarkable these days, as I have been given quotes before then charged above the due a long list of "extras" added to the original quote. this was not the case with Mid Valley Rooter Service. Jonathan dug a hole, replaced the pipe that was the cause of the problem, and got everything flowing again. Much respect for Jonathan, a hard worker in the heat of the day, who was masked up each time we needed to speak, and let me know what was going on each step of the way. Anytime I have another plumbing problem, Mid Valley will get my call and Jonathan will be the man I will request. Highly recommended.< /Text>

Jonathan did a fantastic job replacing my old water heater and he even bought me a new stand for it because he noticed it was corroding underneath, he also stuck around after to fix my sink after all the sediment shot through the line and got stuck in my faucet.< /Review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) The guest house that made the most memorable memories of your trip to America! It was a place where I only saw a desert tour ~ We had plenty of towels and bedclothes 😁 Evening with the guests at the guest house and sharing a review of the trip in the evening, we shared the following schedule! If you come to the blue brush, please try desert tour !! You will be able to make a very memorable moment. Uncle takes pictures of life and shows you a variety of deserts. I have just felt the charm of the desert with my whole body! If you're traveling to LA, Blue Sol Guesthouse is highly recommended !! 💕

Thanks to my uncle, I'm leaving you with happy memories! Thank you

미국여행에서 가장 기억에 남는 추억을 만들어준 게스트 하우스입니다! 사막투어 하나만 보고 갔던 곳이었는데요~ 수건도 넉넉히 챙겨주시고 침구도 깔끔했습니다😁 게스트 하우스에 함께 계신 분들과 저녁에 친목도모와 여행후기들을 나누면서 다음 일정을 함께하기도 했습니다! 푸른솔에 오시면 사막투어를 꼭 해보시기를 바라요!! 정말 너무너무 기억에 남는 순간을 만드실 수 있을거에요😊 삼촌께서 인생사진도 찍어주시고 사막의 다양한 모습을 보여주십니다👍 저는 그저 삼촌이 데려가주시는대로 몸을 맡기면서 사막의 매력을 온몸으로 느끼고 왔습니다! LA에 여행오신다면 푸른솔 게스트 하우스 적극 추천합니다!!💕

삼촌 덕분에 즐거운 추억 남기고 갑니다! 감사합니다😁< /Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) I really enjoyed the most exciting and fun time than expected in the blue brush while traveling west.
If you have any kind questions or needs, please let me know and I was able to help you as much as possible!
The desert tour was not really a trip to the tour, but it was a really fun experience to follow along to a great place to go with!
One of the best memories of traveling to the West and getting to know the people I traveled with, so staying here made my trip even more enjoyable!
At first I booked because it was a good desert tour, and it was the best choice for my trip and it was the best choice for my trip !!!
If I go to LA next time, I want to go back to the desert tour while staying here again.

정말 서부여행하면서 가장 기대도 많이 하고 기대이상으로 재밌었던 시간을 푸른솔에서 즐기고 갑니다~
삼촌이 친절하게 궁금한거나 필요한 거 있으면 알려주세고 최대한 도와주셔서 편히 지낼 수 있었어요!
사막투어는 여행사의 투어 스케줄에 치이는 게 아니라 정말 함께 같이 가는 좋은 곳으로 따라 여행할 수 있는 정말 재미있었던 경험이었어요!
서부에 와서 여행하면서 가장 좋았던 기억중에 하나고, 같이 여행갔던 사람들이랑도 친해질 수 있어서 여기에서 머물르고 나서 앞으로 여행이 더 즐거워졌어요!
처음에는 사막투어가 괜찮다고 해서 예약했는데 정말 후회없는 선택이었고 여행중 가장 잘한 선택이었어요!!!
다음에 또 엘에이를 가게된다면 다시 여기에서 묵으면서 사막투어 다시가고 싶네요~강추😆< /text>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) Hygiene is the worst place I've been to many lodgings, but this is the first time I've wanted to go somewhere else while I'm staying for the first time. I don't know if there's anyone there, and I'm not on the tour. We don't have any information. It's also a mess, and I don't know when I cleaned the bathroom and shower room, and the windows were full of dust, and I always threw blinds to hide them. Never go I don't want to stay in this place again and I don't want to stay in this place again and I'd like to tell you that if you are going to stay for a day other than a desert tour, you should not stay a single day. In a place where more than one person stays, a shower is a man or a woman. If I don't think I'm going to clean the bathroom every day, it's really shining once again. I sincerely wish you

위생상태가 정말 최악인곳입니다 여태 많은 숙박업소들을 둘러봤지만 이렇게 묵는동안 빨리 다른곳으로 가길 원한적은 처음입니다 처음 la도착해서 온곳인데 주인은커녕 관리자도없어 마침 나가는 투숙객덕에 안에 들어갈수있었네요 주인은 체크인하는사람이있는걸 아는지모르는지 투어에만 빠져 어떠한안내도없이 저희가 직접전화해서 키를 찾아서 짐을풀고 수건이나 기본물품도준비가안되어있어 이역시 투숙객한테 빌려쓰고 주인은 딱 잔금 줄 때 빼곤 한번도못봤네요 그러니 위생관리역시 엉망진창이고 화장실과 샤워실은 대체 언제 청소했는지도모르겠고 창문마다 먼지가가득하고 항상 블라인드를내려 숨기기에만 급급했던거같네요 정말이지 민박업소가 아닌 사막투어를 가기위한 전초기지개념으로 만든곳인거같네요 사막투어는 가보지못해 그에관한 코멘트는 하지않습니다 다시는 이런곳에묵고 싶지않으며 사막투어외에 숙박목적으로가시는분은 정말 단하루도묵지말라고 말해드리고싶네요 그리고 방음역시 최악이여서 옆방 알람소리듣고일어날수있으니 알람도필요없고 근 20명이넘는사람이묵는곳에서 샤워시설은 남자하나 여자하나니 내가 화장실청소를 매일할생각이아니면 진짜 다시한번 비추입니다 사장이 이글보고 반성해서 사막투어고자시고 자기 업소 청소와 기본관리에 신경쓰고 또 다른 피해자가없길 간절히 기원합니다</review>

(Translated by Google) It was my first trip to the United States, and I chose one of the many options in Koreatown, where Uber can accompany me, and most of all, it was a great place to start the same experience in a country that is a little scary to be alone

I was hesitant about the desert tour because of the tight schedule, but I wanted to spend good memories with my friends. The desert tour was not only the weather but also the consideration of the people I went with.

This guest house is not a hotel or motel
It's cheaper for friends who have traveled than it seems to be a clean, comfortable and nice place, but it's a place where you can talk about your travel story and make an opportunity for future travel

I've been to several guesthouses in different countries, but it's a place where I can meet Korean's unique affection and new expectations.
I was happy to start my first trip here and will continue to travel with them.

I hope you can join us for your next vacation !!!!

저의 첫 미국여행이였고 많은 선택지들중에 이곳을 선택한 것은 같이 우버를 동행할수 있는 한인타운에 있엇고, 무엇보다 혼자 즐기기에는 조금 무서운 나라에서 같은 경험을 시작하기에 좋은 곳이라고 느꼈습니다

조금 타이트한 일정때문에 사막투어를 망설였지만, 함께 지낸 친구들과 좋은 추억을 보내고 싶어서 가게되었습니다 사막투어는 날씨 뿐만이 아니라 함께가는 사람들과의 배려가 함께 이루어지는 여행이였습니다

이 게스트하우스는 호텔, 모텔이 아닙니다
깨끗하고 안락하고 좋은 장소로 보여지는 곳 보다는 여행을 온 친구들에게 저렴하지만 자기의 여행이야기를 이야기하고 앞으로의 여행도 함께 할수 있는 기회를 만들어 줄 수 있는 곳이에요

다른 나라의 여러 게스트하우스를 다녀보았지만, 한국인 들 특유의 정과 새로운 만남의 기대를 갖게 해주는 곳이에요
이곳에서 첫 여행을 시작해서 행복했고 그 친구들과 앞으로도 계속 여행할 것입니다

다음 휴가도 이곳에서 함께할 수 잇기를!!!!</Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I have visited many Korean guesthouses, but I have never experienced a guesthouse like this! Especially, my friend's uncle's affinity and desert tour will be a memorable memory! If I come again later, I will go unconditionally.

(Translated by Google) Your uncle is so good!
I did not try to stay here for the first time, but I came to a relationship with a desert tour that I happened to come to as a recommendation.
Desert Tour 368, a lot of things to see at a decent price (such as the forest gump backdrop or desert, especially the best starry night) and the food.
I can not forget the memories of watching the stars on the desert tour.
It was the first time I stayed at Gyeongsol and I guess it was not the best among the Korean hostels I went to in terms of facilities and all aspects.
If you visit LA again, it is a place to go back to.
It is highly recommended for visitors to Los Angeles.

주인 삼촌이 너무 좋으세요!
저는 처음 여기 묵으려고한건 아니였는데, 우연히 동행분 추천으로 가게된 사막투어로 인연을 맺게되었습니다.
사막투어 368기였고 괜찮은가격에 많은 볼거리(포레스트검프 배경지나 사막, 특히 가장 좋았던 별이 쏟아지는 밤) 그리고 먹거리까지 ㅎㅎ
사막투어에서 크게 음악틀어놓고 별을 보았던 추억은 평생 잊지 못할것같습니다.
그 인연으로 푸른솔에서 1박 하게 되었고 시설 및 모든 면에서 제가 다닌 한인민박중 최고가 아니였나 생각되네요.
다시 LA를 방문하게 된다면 꼭 다시 돌아가고픈 곳입니다.
LA 방문하시는 여행자분께 완전 추천합니다.< /review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Leave your first review of life. It was my first guesthouse experience. There was a lot of fear, and on the other hand, it was exciting. There were many twists and turns from the beginning. I had to pay the balance, but both my companion and I were having trouble with the ATM withdrawal, but I was able to call and explain the situation so that I could make the payment safely. Also, when we talked about the schedule, I gave them a tip so I enjoyed Universal Studios when no one was there. The bathroom and shower were uncomfortable and the breakfast was great. In particular, the desert tour was so beautiful and ecstatic that it could not be achieved in words, and on the other hand, it was a wonderful experience.
Also, I live and live in Korea and meet with many people, but I want to have a special experience as much as the precious bonds made here. The pork belly and beer that I ate while watching the stars embroidered in the night sky. And after coming back to the hotel, I didn't know that it was late. I feel and learn a lot.
thanked !

감격에 인생 첫 리뷰 남깁니다. 인생 첫 게스트하우스 경험이었습니다. 두려움도 많았고 한편으로는 설렘으로 두근거리기도 했네요. 처음부터 우여곡절이 많았습니다. 잔금 결제를 해야하는데, 동행과 저 둘다 무슨 일인지 ATM 출금이 막혀버려서 곤란한 상황이었는데 전화해서 상황을 설명드리니 친절하고 자세히 설명해주셔서 무사히 결제를 치룰 수 있었습니다. 또 혹시 몰라 일정에 대해 상의드렸을때 꿀팁 제공해주셔서 유니버셜 스튜디오도 사람 없을때 만끽했습니다. 화장실, 샤워실 불편함 느낄 수 없을 정도로 좋았고 조식도 훌륭했습니다. 특히 사막투어는 말로 다 이룰 수 없을 만큼 아름답고 황홀하고 한편으로는 울컥할 정도로 멋진 경험이었네요.
또한 한국에서 생활하며 수많은 사람들과 오고가며 마주치지만 여기서 맺어진 소중한 인연들만큼 특별한 경험이 또 있을까 싶습니다. 밤하늘에 수놓아진 별들을 바라보며 먹었던 삼겹살, 맥주. 그리고 숙소로 돌아와서 이어진 밤늦은줄도 몰랐던 뒷풀이. 참 많은 것을 느끼고 배우고 갑니다.
감사했습니다 !<//Review>< Gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) Three friends went, and we made an unforgettable trip thanks to Purunsol Guesthouse.
I made a reservation as a female dormitory, but he upgraded our room because the general room was open for a few days, and the La trip plan was not salty, but he made a plan for the day of entering, and he gave us plenty of towels to use.
There were 2 toilets, and considering the space used by several people, I stayed for 4 days and there was no big inconvenience.
Most of all, the atmosphere of having a drink between people staying at the hostel at night was good, and thanks to Uncle Thomas, who always takes care of our safety even on desert tours, we have been traveling with fun~
If you like to hang out with people and want to make a little special trip, we recommend Purunsol Guesthouse~~!!

친구 3명이 갔었는데 저희는 푸른솔 게스트하우스 덕분에 잊지못할 여행을 하고 왔습니다.
여성 도미토리로 예약을 했었는데 일반룸이 몇 일 빈다고 저희 방 업그레이드도 해주셨고, La여행 계획은 짜지도 않은 상태에서 갔었는데 입실하는 날 계획도 짜주셨고, 수건도 저희가 충분히 쓸 만큼 넉넉히 주셨습니다~
화장실은 2개 였으며, 여러명이 쓰는 공간을 감안하면 4일 머무르며 큰 불편함은 없었습니다.
무엇보다도 밤에 숙소에서 머무는 사람들끼리 술 한잔 먹는 분위기가 좋았으며, 사막투어에서도 항상 저희 안전을 챙기시는 토마스 삼촌 덕분에 재미있게 여행하고 왔습니다~
사람들과 어울리기 좋아하고, 조금 특별한 여행을 하고 싶은 분들이라면 푸른솔 게스트 하우스 추천합니다~~!!< /text>

<time>1560733608777< /time><review>(Translated by Google) I do not need words. Many troubles that you often encounter while you are on your trip are solved in one place. Location, price, facilities, service and so on. If there is a lack, there is nothing short of nothing. As soon as I first arrived here, I had the greatest feeling of 'Oh why I knew this place now'.
I also went on a tour of the Blue Sol desert and it was by far the best tour without a doubt. I usually feel like going to a desert 'trip' among friends rather than feeling a lot of the tour you think. I was so excited and happy to travel without any worries throughout my trip.
Our Uncle Geha has the ability to go beyond god as much as he takes pictures. I did not see any one person who could not go on a desert trip and shot a life here. There is much more to say, but it was the best hostel and trip for the real traveler. Thank you for having such a hostel, super super super ultra highly recommended!

말이 필요 없습니다. 여행하면서 숙소잡을때 흔히들 하는 많은 걱정들 한방에 해결해줍니다. 위치, 가격, 시설, 서비스 등등 숙소에 지내는동안 뭐하나 부족한게 하나도 없었네요. 부족한게 있다면 아무것도 부족한게 없다는거겠죠. 저는 여기 처음 도착하자마자 ‘아 왜 여길 이제서야 알았지’하는 마음이 제일 컸어요 같이 지내던 분들도 다같이 공감할만큼요.
또 푸른 솔 사막투어를 갔다왔는데 의심의 여지가 없이 단연 최고의 투어였습니다. 보통 많이들 생각하시는 투어의 느낌이아니라 친구들끼리 사막’여행’가는 그런 느낌이더라구요. 여행 내내 걱정은 단 1도 없이 여행해서 너무나 즐겁고 또 즐거웠습니다.
우리 게하 삼촌이 사진찍는거 만큼은 신을 웃돌만한 능력이 있어요. 여기서 사막여행가서 인생샷 못건진사람 진짜 단 1명도 못봤습니다. 더 할 말이 많은데 진짜 여행객들에게는 더 할 나위없는 최고의 숙소와 여행이였습니다. 이런 숙소가 있음에 감사하고, 초강력슈퍼울트라 적극추천드립니다!!!<//review></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) I used Blue Sol Guest House for 4 days in LA. My boss (who doesn't like to call you boss) will give me advice on our schedule and help us get it done!

There are many opinions that there are few toilets in the accommodation, but we were not uncomfortable! He cleaned every day.

And desert tour is by far the best in LA. Thank you so much for your uncle's hard work so that you can get acquainted with the 407s!

If you want to make good connections and good memories in LA, I recommend Blue Sol !!!

uncle!! Get Healthy!
See you again !!

LA일정 4일 동안 푸른솔게스트하우스를 이용하였어요. 사장님(사장님이라고 부르시는걸 싫어하심 이하 삼촌이라고 칭할게요)은 저희 일정에 대해서도 적극적으로 조언을 주시고, 저희가 일정을 무사히 마칠 수 있도록 도와주셨어요!

숙소 이용에 있어서 화장실이 적다는 의견이 많은데 저희는 불편하진 않았어요! 청소도 매일 해주셨어요.

그리고 단연 사막투어는 LA최고의 일정으로 기억에 남고 있어요. 407기 동기들 하고 친해질 수 있도록 가운데서 삼촌이 노력을 많이 해주시는게 느껴져서 너무 감사했습니다!

LA에서 좋은 인연과 좋은 추억을 만드고 싶으신 분들께 푸른솔을 추천드립니다!!!

삼촌!!  건강하세요!
또 찾아뵙겠습니다!!<//Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) If you go to La, I want to stay again!

When I first booked, the price was so good that I worried about it.
I've been to somehow !!!
It's located in Korean town, 5 minutes away from big supermarket, cvs convenience store, McDonald's, Panda Express, etc.
The facilities are clean and towels are still free!
In particular, my uncle is very kind and the desert tour with the boss is unconditionally recommended !! Even though you've been on a two-day, one-night tour of the Grand Canyon in Vegas, you'll never forget a desert tour with your uncle. You can see a lot separately, especially
Uncle's photographic sense is art, so he'll leave a lot of life shots!

La에 간다면 무조건 다시 묵고 싶어요!

처음 예약할때는 가격이 너무 좋아서 혹시나 하고 걱정을 했는데요
막상 가보니 왠걸!!!
한인타운 내에 위치해있는데 5분거리에 큰 대형마트, cvs편의점, 맥도날드, 판다익스프레스등 먹을곳도 굉장히 많았구요
시설도 깨끗했고 수건도 무료로 계속 제공해주세요!!
특히 사장님이신 삼촌께서 엄청 친절하시고 사장님과 함께하는 사막투어 무조건 강추입니다!! 베가스에서 그랜드캐년 1박 2일 투어를 하고 갔는데도 삼촌과 함께하는 사막투어는 잊지 못할 경험입니다. 별도 많이 볼 수 있고, 특히
삼촌의 사진 감각이 예술이어서 인생샷도 많이 남겨주실거게요!< /Text>< pics>

I made a reservation and visited you. I'll give you a refund if the room is full.
You said you'd get another guest house, but there's no contact until late at night, and you can't even reply to the katok. Where should we sleep?
In fact, there was a similar case with other accommodation. But all the bosses said sorry for us, so we didn't feel bad either. However, it is a bad feeling that the boss says that if he or she refunds anyway, it is not a relationship between the guest and the host, but with a twisted leg and an aggressive way of speaking.

좀 그렇네요..
예약하고 방문했는데 본인 실수로 방 다 찼다고 환불해줄테니 나가라고 하셨어요..
다른 게스트하우스 구해주신다고 하셨으면서 밤이 될때까지 연락도 없고 카톡 드려도 답장도 없네요ㅠ 저희는 어디서 자야되는거죠?
사실 다른 숙소도 비슷한 경우가 있었어요. 하지만 모든 사장님이 죄송하시다는 말씀을 해주시니 저희도 기분 나쁘지 않았어요. 하지만 여기는 사장님이 어자피 본인이 환불하면 손님과 호스트의 관계가 아닌 동등한 관계라는 말씀과 다리를 꼬시고 공격적인 말투로 대하시니 기분이 많이 나쁘네요.</Text>< Rating>

I think there are only good reviews here.

First of all, let me explain to you that I stayed 5 nights on Venice Beach and took a hotel nearby. After that, I was looking for accommodation for two days, so I chose a bluesol guest house and made a reservation.

When I arrived, no one came out when I pressed the bell, but I wandered around for a while, knocked on the door and pressed the bell a few more times. And as if we knew we would come, “Ah ~ subdivision….” He greeted us inside and told us to sit down.

You leave your luggage and try to move it on schedule, but you sit down and make excuses that you aren't curious about. When I was busy, crazy and hesitant, I stopped talking and asked what I wanted to say, so I concluded that I can't sleep here today. What was so hard to say?

After all, I'm just talking around to wrap up my irresponsibility and make a mistake. When you talk, you cross your legs, chin your teeth, eat your words and make excuses. In addition, if he only refunds the deposit, he says that he is in the same position anyway, and he does not have to accept any guests.
You can find out about other accommodations and wait 7 hours, but you can't get in touch.

I read that it's good to drink beer at night and socialize with people. But can you give this boss a good night's sleep? I was rather fortunate

Judgment is yours. Have a happy trip

긴글이지만 꼭 끝까지 읽어주세요!!
여기 좋은 리뷰들만 있는 것 같아 평생 처음 리뷰 작성해 봅니다.

먼저 제 일행 설명을 드리자면 베니스 비치쪽에 5박을 하기로 하고 호텔을  그 근처에 잡았으나, 도심으로 나가는 거리가 멀어 숙소를 옮기기로 했습니다. 이후 숙소를 이틀정도 찾아보다 평이 너무 좋은 나머지 푸른솔 게스트 하우스를 선택하고 예약하게 되었습니다.

도착하니 벨을 눌러도 아무도 나오지 않고 한참을 주위를 서성이다가 문을 두드리고 벨을 몇번 더 누르니 그제서야 사장님 같이 보이시는 분이 나왔습니다. 그리고 우리가 올 것을 알았다는 듯 “아~ 세분....”어쩌고 하면서 저희를 안으로 맞아주셨고 우리를 앉으라고 했습니다.

짐을 맡겨만 놓고 일정대로 움직이려고 했지만 앉혀놓고  별로 궁금하지 않은 변명을 늘어놓으시는 겁니다. 본인이 바쁘고, 정신없고, 주저리 주저리 설명을 하시다가 제가 그 분 말씀을 멈추고 그래서 하고싶으신 말씀이 무엇인지 여쭤보니까 오늘 여기서 잘 수가 없다는 것이 결론이었습니다. 그 말이 뭐가 그렇게 힘들었는지요..

결국 본인이 무책임했고 실수했다는 것을 포장하기 위해서 말을 빙빙 돌려서 하는 것입니다. 말할때는 다리를 꼬고, 턱을 괴며 손님의 말을 잘라먹고 변명을 합니다. 또한 자신이 예약금만 환급을 해주면 어차피 동등한 입장이라며 굳이 손님을 받을 필요도 없다고 합니다 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ손님의 시간과 기분은 이 분에게는 장난인가 봅니다.
또한 다른 숙소를 알아봐주신다 하시고 7시간 정도 기다렸지만 연락이 오지 않고 연락도 무시하십니다 하하

읽어보니 밤에 맥주마시고 사람들끼리 친목을 다지며 사막투어가 좋다는데 뭐 알겠습니다. 하지만 이런 사장님께 여행에서 큰 비중을 차지하는 잠자리를 맡기실 수 있습니까? 저는 오히려 다행이라고 생각했습니다

판단은 여러분의 몫입니다. 행복한 여행하세요< /text></record>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>(Translated by Google) uncle! How are you? I think I could have enjoyed my stay in LA thanks to my uncle. While traveling alone, there were a lot of things that were easy to miss. Thank you for taking care of the details so that you can easily handle the schedule after LA. Desert tour in particular was special. See a lot of separate night sky, take pictures of yourself, delicious bulgogi and thrilling off-road experiences. I want to go to the desert tour again even if I go back to the United States !!! ^^

삼촌! 잘지내고 계시죠? LA에서 머무는 동안 삼촌 덕분에 즐겁게 다닐 수 있었언 것 같아요. 혼자 여행하면서 놓치기 쉬운 부분도 많았는데 세세한 부분까지 잘 챙겨주신 덕분에 LA 이후의 일정도 수월하게 소화할 수 있었던 것 같아 감사드립니다. 특히 사막투어는 특별했던 것 같아요. 밤 하늘의 수많은 별도 보고, 직접 사진도 찍어주시고, 맛있었던 불고기와 스릴 넘치는 오프로드 체험까지.. 날을 새면서 조금 피곤하긴 했어도 기억에 많이 남은 것 같습니다. 미국을 다시 간다 해도 사막투어는 또 가고 싶네요!!!^^ 사막투어 397기 화이팅!!ㅎㅎ< /review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

처음에는 저렴한 가격에 숙박할 수 있고 쉽게 가기힘든 사막투어도 같이할 수 있을 것 같아서 선택한 게스트하우스였어요.
여행 끝나고 다시 일상으로 돌아온 지금 생각해보면 정말 잘한 선택이었습니다. 엄청 많은 걸 보고, 느끼고, 얻을 수 있었고 특히 모두 삼촌이라고 부르는 사장님이 정말 많이 챙겨주셔서 너무 감사했던 여행이었습니다. 혹시 게스트하우스에서 머무를실 계획이 있으시다면 정말정말 강추드립니다.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80c2b8f56c490435:0xaeab9c0a7258dab< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

사막투어를 알아보다가 동행분 추천으로 같이 가게 되었어요! 예전에도 캠핑투어를 해봤지만 사람들이 다 가는 곳이 아니라 더 재밌고 좋았어요! 별보며 들었던 음악과 사막에서의 고요함은 평생 잊지 못할것 같아요!!!</text></record>

<time>1568738772525< /time><Review>(Translated by Google) I've experienced both hotel and guest house on my trip to the United States, but it's the best place I've ever stayed.
While traveling, I always feel, but if you think about the cleanliness and system with the help of professionals, you have to pay more and go to the hotel. But the guest house is inexpensive and friendly, so I'm used to it. The common facilities used by many people should keep the basic cleanness of each other, but if there are people who do not do this, the next user will be harmed.
The feeling of blue brush is really 100% guest house.
The warmth, cleanliness and facilities I found at a guest house were the best.
While I was cleaning, I had a lot of cleaning and my uncles were busy because of the high season, but they always did my best to answer my requests.
I hope you will stay there for a long time so you can go next time and next time.

미국 여행에서 호텔하고 민박을 모두 경험해봤는데 머물러봤던 민박집에선 단연 최고 예요.
여행을 다니며 항상 느끼는거지만 전문가의 손길이 들어간 청결과 시스템을 생각한다면 내돈 더 내고 무조건 호텔로 가야해요. 하지만 민박집은 저렴함과 정에 이끌려 결정하게되어서인지 어느정도의 불편함과 부족함은 이제 익숙해요. 아무래도 여러 사람이 사용하는 공동 시설들은 서로서로 기본청결은 지켜줘야하는데 이걸 안하는 분들이 있게되면 다음 사용하는분이 피해를 보게되는거 같아요.
푸른솔의 느낌은 정말 민박집 100% 예요.
민박집에서 느낄수있는 푸근함과 청결 그리고 시설은 민박집으로는 최고였어요.
제가 있는동안은 청소하는 아주머니 자주 뵜었고 삼촌들은 성수기라 바쁘셨지만 요청하는 것에는 항상 최선을다해 답해주셨어요.
다음에도 또 다음에도 갈수있도록 푸른솔이 계속 잘되어서 오래오래 있어주실 바랄께요.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<time>1553930681201</time><text>(Translated by Google) I went to the desert tour 350 times. I went to Joshua with my friend because he was so good.
I spent all my life with Ellie!
When I was in the evening with other people, my uncle and I gathered together and got a beer.
My uncle was not tied to the frame of the tour,
It is not such a tour that you take a few pictures from your destination, but you go there and there too. You show me every important point, especially the campfire.
In the desert where nobody can see, the meat that we bake right on the firewood is really the best ~~~!
Uncle ~ who showed me many scenes and showed me beautiful scenes on the move.

사막투어 350기 다녀왔어용 ~ 조슈아 갔다온 친구가 너무 좋다고 해서 저 데리고 한번 더 방문한곳 ㅋㅋ
엘에이 있는 내내 푸른솔에서 지냈어요!
다른 방 사람들과 저녁에 시간되면 삼촌이랑 다같이 옹기종기 모여서 맥주 한잔 하고 ㅋㅋㅋ재밌었어요~~
삼촌은 투어라는 틀에 얽매이지않고 그때그때 상황에 따라 방문하는곳이 달라진다는점이 너무 좋았어요~
여기도 가고 저기도 가고~~ 목적지에서 사진몇개 찍고 바로 끝나는 그런 투어가 아니라 중요한 포인트 하나하나 다 보여주시고 ,특히 캠프파이어 최고입니당 ..
아무도 안보이는 사막에서 우리끼리 장작불에 바로 구워먹는 고기는 정말 최고~~~!
이동 하면서 여러가지 얘기 많이 해주시고 이쁜 풍경 보여주신 삼촌 ~~덕분에 너무 좋은 경험 하구 가요 👍🏻👍🏻</text>< user_id>

(Translated by Google) This is an honest review of Purunsol Guesthouse!!
1. My uncle (the boss) is very kind and kind!! I saw you for a short time, but I feel like I'm closer than my real uncle..?? Thank you so much for taking care of our guests and taking care of them!!
2. The bed is comfortable and the people in the dormitory are so kind and kind as the guesthouse has a good atmosphere! You will definitely get what you need while communicating!
3. The desert tour is just the best! Please take great photos as well.. I've done a lot of tours around a lot of countries so far, but without thinking it's the most special and enjoyable tour. If you get a chance, try it!!
4. The atmosphere of the guesthouse created by the owner is really harmonious and enjoyable! If I come back to LA, I will definitely stay at Purunsol.

푸른솔 게스트하우스 솔직 리뷰입니다!!
1. 삼촌(사장님)께서 정말 너무 친절하게 잘해주십니다!! 짧은 시간 뵈었지만 제 진짜 삼촌보다 더 가까워진 것 같은 느낌..?? 투숙객들 여러모로 챙겨주시고 신경써주셔서 너무 좋아요!!
2. 잠자리도 편하고 도미토리 사람들도 게스트하우스 좋은 분위기만큼 다들 너무 친절하고 착하세요! 필요하신 부분들은 소통하면서 분명히 얻으실 수 있을 거예요!
3. 사막투어는 그저 최고입니다! 사진도 정말 멋지게 잘 찍어주세요.. 여태까지 적지 않은 나라를 부지런히 돌아다니며 많은 투어들을 해봤지만 고민하지 않고 가장 특별하고 즐거운 투어라고 뽑을 수 있습니다 기회가 된다면 꼭 해보세요!!
4. 사장님께서 만들어주시는 게스트하우스 분위기가 정말 화목하고 즐겁습니다! LA 다시 오게되면 무조건 푸른솔에서 묵을 것 같아요

여러분 꼭 푸른솔 가셔서 토마스삼촌과 폴삼촌과 잊지 못할 추억 만드세요!! 강추입니다!!< /text>

(Translated by Google) While I was wondering where to go for my first trip to LA, I stumbled across a blog and booked it !!!!!
I forgot to change the date so I couldn't make a reservation for a day. So I came here today.
If you ask for the route or schedule, let me know, and if you have any nearby restaurants, let me know.
There's a toilet and a shower in the girls room on the first floor.
I always get up at 6 in the morning and start the schedule so I used it comfortably without getting crowded in the shower !!!! Towels were also used 2-3 times a day, so it was comfortable enough, and hot water came out well so there was no inconvenience !!!!!
There is also a kitchen where you can eat simple dishes and boiled ramen noodles !!!!
Best of all !!!!! Sa! Mak! To! Uh !!!!!!

I was so lucky that the day of our 454 desert tour was not windy, cold or warm!
And it's not just desert, but Mojave desert TT.
Star photo taken with my uncle's camera Really fantastic fantastic success ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Really pretty ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
I'm a lucky jockey and see a lot of shooting stars !!!!!!

The hot and grilled meat and beer are really ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ And the Joshua Desert that I saw on my way back was like a western movie
In addition, off-road who used uncle car !!!!! I don't know if it's offroad in a few months! Let's jump and jump 2pac when the song starts!
Shake, drop, and hit your head while taking a video
I uploaded a sunroof and imitated Kang Min-kyung. I took a picture.
The desert fox that you were looking at how !!! Look at 4 !!!! I couldn't see a puma or a komodo lizard.
I went back and did the real bbbbbbb

Besides, our 454 was so good and good friends to meet and stay in touch with the schedule after LA. We also meet in Las Vegas every day, eat, drink, shop, watch and walk around.
I'm going to live in Korea ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ 🎂
My uncle can't do this.

And uncle !!!!
My uncle is the best dormitory I've ever met !!!! TT It's so nice and I can't express it. I thought public transportation could save a lot of money than other companies !!! It's always cold for our guests, and it's not cold, so please leave your luggage for our Las Vegas schedule !!!!!!!! 500% recommended if you are friends of L.A. 👍 👍 👍 👍

@ BurnSooLee❤️ 💛💚💙💜 ❣️💕💞💓💗💖💘💝

첫 LA여행 숙소를 어디로 잡을까 고민하다가 우연히 블로그에서 후기를 보게 되어 예약했어요!!!!!
날짜가 바뀐다는 걸 깜박하고 가서 예약도 하루 안되어있는 상황에서 그럼 일단 오늘 왔으니까 숙박하자고 흔쾌히 말씀해주셔서 기쁘게 들어갔습니다!!!!!
루트나 일정 물어보면 다 알려주시고 혹시 근처에 있는 맛집 어딘지 여쭤보면 다 알려주셔서 실패없이 맛있는데서 많이 먹고 왔어요!!!
1층 여자방에는 화장실 1개, 샤워실 1개 있구요, 화장실 1개는 바깥에 있어서 빡빡하지는 않았어요
항상 아침 6시에 일어나서 일정 시작해서 그런지 샤워실 붐비는 것도 없고 편하게 이용했습니다!!!! 수건도 하루 2-3장씩 넉넉하게 주셔서 부족함 없이 편하게 사용했구요, 뜨거운 물도 잘 나와서 불편한건 없었어용!!!!!
부엌도 있어서 간단한 요리도 해먹을 수 있었고 라면도 야무지게 끓여서 먹었습니다!!!!
무엇보다 제일 좋았던건!!!!! 사!막!투!어!!!!!!

운이 너무너무 좋았던게 저희 사막투어 454기가 출발한 날은 바람도 없고 춥지도 않고 온도도 따뜻했어요!
그리고 그냥 사막이 아니라 무려 모하비 사막ㅜㅜ 캘서듄가서 모래언덕도 보고 오고 별도 보고 달 지는것도 봐서 넘나 좋았어요♥︎♡
삼촌 카메라로 찍은 별사진 진짜 넘나 환상적 로맨틱 성공적ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 진짜 예뻐요ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 친구들도 별 뭐냐고 하고!!!!!!!!
운이 좋은 기수라 별똥별도 많이 보고!!!!!!

해뜨고 구워먹은 고기랑 맥주도 진짜ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 그리고 돌아오는 길에 봤던 조슈아 사막은 흔히 생각하는 서부영화 한장면 같았어요ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
거기다 삼촌 차로 했던 오프로드!!!!! 몇달 만에 하는 오프로드인지 모르겠다 했던 그 오프로드!!!!  점핑부터 시작해서 2pac 노래가 시작되면 덜커덩 덜커덩 쾅쾅 점핑!!!!
동영상 찍다 흔들리고 떨어지고 머리박고ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
썬루프도 올려서 강민경 흉내도 내곸ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 사진도 찍곸ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 진짜 너무 좋았어요!!!!!
그 보기 귀하다던 사막여우도 무려!!! 4마리나 보고!!!! 퓨마나 코모도 도마뱀은 못봐서 쪼까 아쉽지마잉ㅜㅜㅜ 그래도 너무 좋았어요!!!
갔다와서 한 뒷풀이도 진짜bbbbbbb

거기다 우리 454기 너무너무 착하고 좋은 친구들 만나서 엘에이 이후 일정도 맞춰서 아직까지 연락하고 라스베가스에서도 매일같이 만나서 밥먹고 술마시고 쇼핑하고 구경하고 돌아다닌🍻
한국에서 생파 예정임요ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ🎂
삼촌도 이런 기수 없다던ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 이상한 기수ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

그리고 삼촌!!!!
삼촌은 진짜 제가 만난 도미토리 중에 최고!!!!ㅜ 진짜 너무 좋으시고 뭐라 말로 표현할 수 없을 정도로ㅠㅠㅠ 카톡도 그렇고 숙소 연장도 그렇고 진짜 너무 최고란 말밖에 안나와요ㅠㅠ 버스 노선 다 알려주시고 진짜 우버비 많이 드는거 생각했는데 대중교통도 생각보다 많이 타사 돈 아낄수 있었어요!!! 항상 투숙객 저희 편의 봐주시고 춥진 않니 수건은 있니 부터 저희 라스베가스 일정 동안 짐도 흔쾌히 맡아주시고!!!!!!!! 진짜 주변에 엘에이 가는 친구 ㅇ있다면 500% 추천합니다👍  👍  👍  👍

(Translated by Google) As soon as I arrived in Los Angeles, Uber contacted Uncle Bluesol when he was struggling and explained kindly. When I first arrived, I wasn't in the desert due to a tour of the desert, but he kindly told me how to use the phone. I've been to guest houses in many countries, but no one is as friendly as here. In addition, through the desert tour, I have not experienced before. Lying together at dawn, watching the stars, having a barbecue and off-road in the desert. The next time you come back to LA, you'll definitely want to stay.

LA에 도착하자마자 우버가 안잡혀 고생을했을 때 푸른솔 삼촌에게 연락을 드렸더니 바쁜 와중에도 친절하게 설명해 주셨습니다. 숙소에 처음 도착했을 때 사막투어 일정 때문에 자리에 계시진 않았지만 전화를 통해 이용 방법을 친절히 알려 주셨습니다. 많은 나라에 게스트하우스를 다녔지만 여기 만큼 친절한 곳은 없었습니다.  뿐만 아니라 사막투어를 통해 지금까지 느껴보지 못한 경험을 하였습니다. 새벽에 다같이 누워서 별을 보고 바베큐를 먹고 사막에서의 오프로드까지.. 정말 즐거운 경험이었습니다. 다음에 LA에 다시 와도 꼭 머물고 싶은 곳입니다.< /text>

(Translated by Google) I was in a hurry to get to the airport a couple of days ago. I think I was really lucky to think about it. I'm going to take a really good impression after going on a desert tour. Thanks to my uncle, I feel like I have a really good experience. If you do not know where to go, be sure to stop by and visit the desert tour. You will not regret it.

<Review>(Translated by Google) Dwaetneunde day trip to the summit of 2 nights, the place is left to regret not staying longer!
Desert tour and many people who have already been mentioned in the reviews I would not dare to express in writing. When can we see the stars falling down and see so many shooting stars in less than a few hours? I miss the quiet time I spent together sitting in the desert
Uncle Thomas of Blue Sol Guest House is not just the owner of the guest house, he really loves people and loves to travel! When my uncle told me to travel without sightseeing, I changed my future itinerary as my uncle informed me.
Today, Uncle Thomas, who is carefully checking the weather etc. to present the best experience of desert tour to everyone who stays in Blue Sol.
Thank you, thank you, thank you again !!
Bundeulkkeseo're seeing a lot of this post also come through the cumbersome pureunsol hope that you agree with my article!
Long live the blue Sol, Uncle Thomas, best 394!

여행 일정상 2박을 하게 됐는데, 그 이상 머물지 못한 것이 아쉬움으로 남는 곳입니다!
많은 분들이 이미 후기에서 언급하고 계시는 사막투어는 감히 글로 표현할 수 없을 것 같아요. 누워서 쏟아지는 별을 보고, 몇 시간이 채 안되는 시간동안 그렇게 많은 별똥별을 보는 경험을 언제 또 할 수 있을까요. 사막에서 다같이 앉아 보냈던 고요한 시간이 벌써 그립습니다ㅠㅠ
푸른솔 게스트 하우스의 토마스 삼촌은 그냥 게스트하우스의 주인이 아닌, 진심으로 사람을 좋아하고, 여행을 사랑하시는 분이에요! 관광하지 말고 여행을 하라는 삼촌의 말씀을 듣고 저는 이후의 여행 일정을 삼촌이 알려주신대로 과감히 변경했는데...정말 삼촌을 만나지 못했다면 생각도 못했을 여행을 했습니다!!
오늘도 역시나 푸른솔에 머무는 모든 이들에게 사막투어라는 최고의 경험을 선물하기 위해 날씨 등을 꼼꼼하게 체크하고 계실 토마스 삼촌!
감사하고 감사하고 또 감사해요!!
이 글을 보고 계시는 많은 분들께서도 꼭 푸른솔을 거쳐가시고 제 글에 공감하실 수 있기를 바랍니다!

<rating>5</rating><text>(Translated by Google) I'm staying with Blue Friends for three days and four days really well ^^ I don't want to forget this good feeling. The blue brush was good from the first impression. I was nervous because this was my first trip to the United States, but Uncle Thomas (who doesn't like the sound of my boss) had been talking about it for a month before I went to America, so thank you for your kind and detailed response. The desert tour was told to decide whether to start the day or night according to the weather, so I planned the rest of the plan so that I could vaguely change the schedule with the thought that I wanted to go on the 13th day of arrival.
Since I arrived at the airport, I arrived in contact with a lot of people, and the first thing I was surprised after meeting and talking to the guesthouse people was that there were not many people who returned twice or three times! Everyone was astonished at how accustomed they were to cooking and sitting together in the kitchen as if they were at home. After unpacking and having dinner, I was the first to see my uncle, and I was very kind, and I could give you any towels or anything you needed. When you saw the weather on the way, there was too much cloud, so the tour would be hard today. He also has to look at it separately and have to digest all the schedules outdoors from dawn to daytime.
I went on the 408 tour at 11:30 pm on the 14th and it was a very good experience, but I will not leave it in detail because it will be a spoiler. I did too, but I don't know how many times more fun !! Enough explanation Enough time to indulge in sentiment and emotion I think it was perfect until photo time. Tour course is not the same every number, so if you have a chance I want to go to another course. Also expect activity in the automotive and off-road mandeukyi ㅎㅎ.
During the day inconvenient to wash out schedule planned move that has never had. The facilities are clean and the toilets are used by many people. I'd better protect myself. What He let solve all the lack of thumb is that if you tell uncle.

I was surprised to see later .. Why do you think roughly, but this place is faithful to the guest house, not expecting hotel-class service. The desert tour is easy to digest the planned schedule and think that if the weather is good and the right people get the chance, they will make a precious experience like jewelry with a bonus. I'm not going to force you to go on a tour for a few days ... If you talk to your uncle directly, you won't be misunderstood. I'm sick .. TT. I apologize for not being able to see you.
Uncle Thomas! I feel like I have a real uncle in the United States. Now LA is no longer a strange land to me. If I get a chance, I'll come and catch a flight to LA again. In the meantime, stay healthy! thanked.

친구와 함께 푸른솔에서 3박 4일동안 정말 잘 머물고 갑니다^^ 이 좋은 느낌을 잊고 싶지 않아 후기를 쓰며 되돌아봅니다. 푸른솔은 첫인상부터 좋았어요. 저는 이번이 첫 미국 여행이라 긴장을 많이 했는데 한달 전부터 토마스 삼촌(사장님 소리를 안좋아하십니다ㅎㅎ)이 카톡 주셔서 미국 가기도 전부터 질문을 많이 드렸는데 답변을 매번 친절하고 자세하게 해주셔서 너무 감사했습니다. 사막투어는 날씨에 따라 밤/낮 출발 여부를 결정한다는 말을 듣고 막연하게 13일 도착날 가고싶다는 생각만 가지고 유동적으로 일정 변경할 수 있게끔 나머지 계획을 짰어요.
공항부터 모르는 게 많아 연락하면서 도착했고, 처음 게스트하우스 사람들을 만나고 얘기를 나눠본 후 가장 놀란 점은 두번 세번 재방문한 사람이 적지 않았다는거! 모두들 자기 집마냥 부엌에서 자유롭게 요리하고 모여앉아 얘기하는 등 익숙한 모습에 놀랐습니다. 짐을 풀고 저녁을 먹은 후 처음 삼촌을 뵀는데 역시나 친절하셨고 수건이나 필요한 게 있으면 얼마든지 줄 수 있다고, 오는 길에 날씨를 보니 구름이 너무 많이 들어와서 오늘은 투어가 힘들 것 같다고 하시더군요. 그도 그럴 것이 별도 봐야하고 새벽부터 낮까지 모든 일정을 야외에서 소화해야 하는데 날씨가 안 좋으면 몸만 고생하겠더군요.
14일 밤 11시반에 408기 투어를 떠났고 너무너무너무 좋은 경험이었지만 스포가 될까봐 자세히 남기진 않겠습니다. 저도 그랬지만 모르고 가야 몇 배는 더 재밌어요!! 충분한 설명 충분한 감상 및 감성에 빠질 시간 포토타임까지 완벽했던 것 같아요.. 투어 코스도 매기수마다 같은 게 아니라고 하셔서 기회가 된다면 또 다른 코스로도 가보고 싶네요. 오프로드에서 자동차 만득이의 활약을 또 기대하며..ㅎㅎ
낮동안에는 계획했던 일정대로 움직이고 씻고 나가는 데 불편한 점은 전혀 없었습니다. 시설도 깨끗했고 화장실 같은 경우엔 여럿이 쓰는 공간이다 보니 뒷사람 배려해서 머리카락 치우고 발닦은 수건 바로 해놓는 매너 정도? 스스로 지켜주면 좋을 것 같아요. 무엇보다도 부족한 것 있으면 삼촌한테 말씀드리면 다 해결해주십니다.

밑에 후기보곤 놀랐습니다.. 왜 그러시는지 대충 짐작은 가는데 이곳은 게스트하우스의 본분에 충실한 곳이고, 호텔급 서비스를 기대하실 곳은 아닙니다. 사막투어는 계획했던 일정들 소화하고 날씨가 좋고 적당한 인원이 모여 기회가 된다면 덤으로 보석같은 귀중한 경험 만들고 온다고 생각하시면 편할 것 같아요. 며칠날 꼭 투어를 가야한다 강요하실게 아니라요... 삼촌이랑 직접 조금만 대화해보면 오해가 없을텐데 마음이 아프네요..ㅜㅜ 저희 기수도 더할 나위없이 좋은 경험 하고 왔고 모두들 만족했지만 보름달 때문에 더 많은 별들을 못보여줘서 미안하다고 사과하시는 분입니다.
토마스 삼촌! 저는 미국에 진짜 삼촌이 생긴 기분이에요ㅎㅎ 이제 미국 LA는 저에게 더이상 낯선 땅이 아니라 언제든 돌아올 곳이 생긴 것 같아서 좋아요. 기회가 된다면 또 LA행 비행기타고 놀러올게요. 그동안 건강하세요!! 감사했습니다.</text>< pictures>

<date>1541937638267< /date><Rate>5</Rate><Review>(Translated by Google) Good morning? This is a traveler who accidentally booked the Purunsol Guesthouse and went on a desert tour with 314 units after learning about a desert tour at a drink in the hostel at night.
I was in a hurry to plan a trip, so I went to the accommodation in LA without a fixed schedule, but I thought it was easy to travel because we shared places to go and things were so well done.
In particular, the desert tour is literally a jackpot. Especially, the weather was nice and I was lucky, so I think I saw all the shooting stars that I will see all my life on that day. My uncle who conducted the trip took good pictures and cooked meat, and, I felt like I was camping, not a tour.
It was a lodging that I would like to visit again if I have to go to LA later~

안녕하세요? 우연히 푸른솔 게스트하우스를 예약했다가 밤에 숙소 내 술자리에서 사막투어를 알게 되어 314기로 사막투어를 다녀온 여행객입니다.
급하게 여행 계획을 짜게 되어 LA 에서 일정이 정해지지 않은 상태로 숙소를 가게 되었는데 서로 가볼 만한 곳에 대해 공유하고 이런게 너무 잘 되어 있어서 여행하는데 수월했던 거 같아요.
특히 사막투어는 말 그대로 대박입니다 특히 날씨도 좋았고 운도 좋아서 평생 볼 별똥별을 그 날 다 본 거 같네요. 여행을 진행해주신 삼촌이 사진도 잘 찍어주시고 고기도 구워주시고,,, 투어가 아니라 캠핑 온 기분이었습니다.
나중에 LA 갈 일 있으면 또 방문하고 싶은 숙소였습니다~</Review>< pictures>

My Uncle Guest House helped me to make my trip more efficient and enjoyable by helping with the itinerary and information sharing.

The Joshua Tree Desert Tour is the best course only in the Bluesol Guest House, and it can be considered as a fortunate tour that can only be reached by meeting the individual travel schedule, weather, and number of participants. If you are staying here, I highly recommend taking this desert tour opportunity.

uncle! I wrote a late review.
Thanks to your help, it seems like a safe, enjoyable and memorable trip.
Let's visit the guest house again!
I wish you always good health and good luck~

무엇보다 좋은것은 사람들의 끈끈한 정과 조슈아트리 사막 투어라고 할 수 있습니다.

게스트 하우스 삼촌께서 여행 일정과 정보공유와 관련된 여러 도움을 주셔서 더 효율적이고 즐거운 여행을 할 수 있었습니다.

조슈아트리 사막투어는 푸른솔 게스트 하우스만이 가진 최고의 코스이며, 개개인의 여행 일정과 날씨, 참여 인원등이 모두 맞아야 갈 수 있는 행운의 투어라고도 볼 수 있습니다. 이곳에 머물게 된다면 이 사막투어의 기회를 반드시 잡으시길 추천합니다.

삼촌! 후기를 늦게 작성하였습니다.
도와주신 덕분에 안전하고 즐겁고 기억에 남았던 여행이 되었던것 같습니다.
다시 한 번 게스트 하우스를 찾아 뵙겠습니다!
항상 건강하시고 행운이 가득하시길 기원합니다~

<review>(Translated by Google) It is a desert tours art ~ It was a lot of people who came together and went together. Uncle meets the needs of the customer precisely and the pictures are really good, so everyone gets a shot of life! The fortress is also better than going to San Francisco! Once I have a tour with my uncle, it is a fun potenza. 🤩 I came to LA with a little planning but I recommend it because of its position and orientation. But I am inclination alone. Almost every night, drink parties and people who are sensitive to sleep can not sleep ~ ~ If the shower is full of people, war can be a war. Fortunately, during my stay I did not have a lot of people and I did not have a lot of people.

사막투어 예술입니다~ 갔다 오면 같이 간 분들끼리 시끌벅적 해지고 동행 많이 하시더라고요. 삼촌이 고객의 니즈를 정확하게 충족 해 주시고 사진도 진짜 잘 찍어 주셔서 모두가 인생샷 건져요! 요새미티도 샌프란에서 가는 것보다 더 좋아요! 일단 삼촌과 함께 하는 투어는 그 자체가 재미 포텐입니다🤩 저는 좀 무계획으로 LA 왔는데 성향이랑 위치 따져서 추천도 해 주세여~~ 근데 나는 성향이 혼자가 좋다 조용함이 최고다 하면 숙소 바꾸세요. 거의 매일 밤마다 술파티를 해서 예민하신 분들은 잠 못자요~~ 사람 가득 차면 화장실, 샤워도 전쟁 일 수 있어요. 다행히 저는 묵는 동안 동선들이 겹치지 않고 사람이 많지 않았는데, 아니었던 이야기 들어보니 힘들었을 수도 있을 거 같아요.</review>< Rating>

(Translated by Google) It's already been two months since I went to Purunsol and it's been three months, but I'm late to leave a review like this!

Uncle Purunsol!!! Really kind and like a real uncle!! Please treat me!!! Everyone said that it was because they liked the ‘atmosphere’ so much, but the facilities were okay.ZZ I lived in Jeju as a guesthouse staff for over a month and visited a lot of Gehha, which was uncomfortable with facilities. (However, the 6-person room may feel a little narrow! But!!! If you are going now, you don't have to worry because you'll be staying at the new Purunsol.><) I remember saying that I was the boss with the title of'boss' stuck in my mouth. It was great that my uncle told me to call me uncle instead of the boss...

Above all, the great thing about Purunsol is that it creates an atmosphere where people can meet and provides space! First of all, the desert tour is an opportunity to leave precious memories! I used to be the 231, but I'm curious how many are now!!!! Give me time for my uncle to go to Joshua and see the outlets! When you arrive, a terrifying off-road experience awaits.^^ But, only the expression of the real uncle is peaceful, and the rear seats are unfolding. If you sit in the back seat, you may get muscle pain (I'm serious, I'm not kidding) I almost cried when I sat in the back seat and then jumped in the car~ㅋㅋㅋ But it's really fun.

Also, if you add a little exaggeration, is there a skill that you can almost work as a photographer for your uncle? So you can get a life shot. You can also take pictures on the car. But I was a little scared... Oh, but the real off-road is a memory I will never forget. It's a Legend of Legends... I want to go again after writing.

Am I more comfortable with the companions I did on the Las Vegas tour and meet again at Purunsol? I think I sent it. But!! You can get an impromptu companion from Purunsol! I also went to LA with my sister, brother, and friends of the same age that I met at Purunsol, and when I moved to San Francisco, I met again and took a bike tour at the Golden Gate Bridge!

A quiet and relaxing accommodation is of course nice, but in a hostel like Purunsol, you can meet a lot of precious relationships. Sister, brother... How are you? My uncles, I miss the motives of the desert tour at that time, and most of all, I miss the memories of being happy in LA. The delicious breakfast prepared by Uncle Paul.

I will definitely go again Uncle!!! Please always stay in good shape.♥
Let's wrap up the bluesol!

벌써 푸른솔에 다녀온 지 두 달이란 시간이 넘어 세 달이 다 되어 가는데 늦게나마 이렇게 후기를 남깁니다!ㅠㅠ 토마스 삼촌이 오랜만에 연락 주셔서 얘기 나누다가 후기 남기지 못 했던 게 기억이 나서요 엉엉...

푸른솔 삼촌들!!! 정말 친절하시고 진짜 삼촌처럼!! 대해주십니다!!! 다들 시설보다는 ‘분위기’가 너무 좋아서 가는 거라고 했었는데 저는 시설도 괜찮았어요ZZ 제주에서 게스트하우스 스탭으로 한 달 넘게 살면서 시설 불편한 게하도 많이 가봤는데 푸른솔은 불편한 점 없이 잘 지냈습니다!! (단, 6인실은 조금 좁게 느끼실 수도 있어요! 하지만!!! 이제 가시는 분들은 새로운 푸른솔에서 묵으실 테니 걱정하지 않으셔도 될듯><) 제가 ‘사장님’이라는 호칭이 입에 붙어서 계속 사장님이라고 했던 기억이 나는데 삼촌이 사장님 말고 삼촌이라 부르라고 해주셔서 넘 좋았어여...ㅎㅎ

무엇보다 푸른솔의 좋은 점은 사람들을 만날 수 있는 분위기를 조성해주고 공간을 제공해준다는 점이에요! 일단 사막투어부터가 소중한 추억을 남길 수 있는 기회라는 것~! 저는 231기였는데 지금은 몇 기인지 궁금하네요!!!! 삼촌이 조슈아 가시면서 아울렛 구경할 수 있는 시간도 주시고요! 도착하면 어마무시한 오프로드 체험이 기다리고 있습니다^^ 근데 진짜 삼촌 표정만 평화롭고 뒷자리는 난리부르스가 펼쳐집니다. 맨 뒷자리에 앉으시면 근육통 얻으실 수도 있어요(진심입니다. 농담 아닙니다) 맨 뒷자리 앉았다가 차 점프하는 부분에서 담 와서 거의 울었답니다~ㅋㅋㅋ 근데 진짜 재밌어요ㅜㅜㅜㅠㅠ

또 과장 조금 보태면 삼촌 거의 사진작가 겸업하셔도 될 솜씨거덩여? 그래서 인생샷 건지실 수 있어요. 차 위에서 사진도 찍으실 수 있어요. 근데 쪼금 무서웠어요... 아 근데 진짜 오프로드는 평생 잊지 못할 추억이에요. 레전드 오브 전설이고요... 글 쓰다 보니 다시 가고 싶어요 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ

저는 라스베이거스 투어 같이 했던 동행들이랑 푸른솔에서 다시 만나서 더 편하게? 보낸 것 같아요. 하지만!! 푸른솔에서도 즉흥적으로 동행 구하실 수 있어요! 저도 푸른솔에서 만난 언니,오빠,동갑내기 친구랑 LA 일정도 같이 다녔고 한 언니와는 샌프란시스코로 옮겼을 때도 다시 만나서 금문교에서 자전거 투어도 같이 했답니다!!!

조용하고 쉬어가는 느낌의 숙소도 물론 좋지만, 푸른솔 같은 숙소에서는 소중한 인연들을 많이 만날 수 있어서 참 좋습니다. 언니,오빠... 잘 지내시려나ㅠㅠㅠㅠ삼촌들,그때 사막투어 동기들도 보고싶고 무엇보다 LA에서의 행복했던 기억이 그립네요. 폴 삼촌께서 준비해주셨던 맛있는 아침도요....

저 꼭 다시 갈게요 삼촌!!! 항상 건강한 모습으로 그대로 있어주세요..♥

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>(Translated by Google) Hello. It is a traveler who has traveled through the desert with 250 planes by chance because he accidentally made a reservation for the Blue Soul and later learned about the desert tour.
Originally, I traveled to the United States without a plan, so I thought and visited it for a day or two to get a tip for Los Angeles.
It was the first time that I had bundled Korean accommodation while traveling, but the advantage of Korean accommodation is that I don't have to worry about luggage. That was the best thing.
Also, it was good to talk about my uncle who is the owner, but it was best to think about the minds of travelers first. There are various restrictions from the operator's point of view when operating the accommodation, but his uncle was happy to have the flexibility to make the trip as enjoyable as possible.
Luckily, I went on a desert tour with 250 planes, so I had some benefits and I was able to leave good memories too.

안녕하세요. 우연히 푸른솔 예약했다가 뒤늦게 알고 사막투어를 알게 되어 운 좋게 250기로 사막투어를 다녀온 여행객입니다.
원래는 계획 없이 떠나온 미국 여행이라 LA 여행팁을 얻으려고 하루 이틀 정도 생각하고 방문 했는데 거의 10일 가까이 있었던 것 같네요.
여행하면서 한인 숙소 묶어본 건 처음이였는데 한인 숙소의 장점은 아무래도 짐 걱정할 필요가 없는 것 같아요. 그 점이 제일 좋은 점이였습니다.
또 주인장이신 삼촌에 대해서 말씀드리면 다 좋았지만 여행객의 마음을 우선으로 생각해주시는게 제일 좋았습니다. 숙소를 운영하다 보면 운영자 입장에서는 여러가지 제한을 둘 수 있는데 삼촌은 최대한 여행객들이 여행을 즐길 수 있게 유연하게 편의를 봐 주셔서 좋았습니다.
운 좋게 250기로 사막 투어를 가서 혜택도 있었고 좋은 추억도 남길 수 있어서 너무 좋았습니다~<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<review>(Translated by Google) I stayed at Gosol Guesthouse for a week while traveling L.A. In fact, I was worried because it was my first time to go to a guesthouse before I traveled. I thought that it would be inconvenient to live in a space with people I do not know, but it was not at all. My uncle once took care of us really well. It was fun and kind as you were my uncle. So, I spent time with my uncle, sharing many stories and giving me serious advice on my troubles. I got so much power thanks to my uncle! And the people who stayed at the guest house were so nice to share a lot of stories together at night! Also the accommodation facilities were comfortable to stay. It is divided into two floors on the first floor, and it was good to have breakfast! After a couple of days, I was like my home. 
 
Also, the 354th trip to the desert tour will be the most memorable of all the trips I've been to. I went to the desert tour and the most wanted to see was the star in the night sky, but because my uncle had taken the tour in consideration of the situation of the day, I could see so many stars! It looks like you've seen all the stars you've seen for a lifetime. It was so good. Not only that, but it was not a formal tour, but the place to go along that day also changed, and if there was a wonderful place, it was more attractive because my uncle took pictures from the car and took all the pictures. Uncle photo skill is a big hit! I took a lot of shots of life from my uncle's pictures! While touring, I saw a lot of Joshua tree and cacti, and off-road experience will be memorable! I was really thrilled! It was fun! In the evening, I had a campfire while my uncle baked bacon, which was delicious. After eating it, I was so happy to sit on a chair and drink a can of beer and see the stars embroidered in the sky. I sat down and sat down and watched the sky without any thought, but the starlings fell a lot, the constellations seemed clear, and the place itself was so dreamy! When I look at the stars and talk to my uncle and the desert tour motives, the time goes fast. It was so boring that it was so boring! Welcome to Gosol Guest House Desert Tour I really recommend it! 

And my friend and my uncle also went on a Solvang & Santa Barbara tour. We took the place where we could not go because we could not drive and my uncle wanted us to go to the outlets too, but he also considered it and added an outlet to the itinerary! So we could even shop! It is my uncle who always thinks what we want to do. ㅠ It was like going to Solvang and traveling to Denmark. I went to Santa Barbara and felt like coming to Spain, and I experienced a European village. It was beneficial for me too! He told me not only that but also many interesting anecdotes. I did not know how time went! Also, my uncle was so grateful for buying lunch and dinner.
 
My first trip to the United States was so I had a hard time deciding how to schedule it, but my uncle helped me a lot. I also wanted to let you know where you can buy a Universal Studios ticket at a reasonable price, and I recommend you to go somewhere, so I spent a week really hard on it! It was so good that Korea wanted to change the airplane time. I will arrange travel expenses and go to see my uncle again soon! I really recommend Gosol Guest House :)

L.A 여행을 하며 일주일 동안 푸른솔 게스트 하우스에서 묵었어요. 사실 여행 가기 전에 게스트하우스는 처음이라서 걱정을 많이 했어요. 모르는 사람들과 한 공간에서 지내고 생활하는 것이 불편하지는 않을까 생각했었는데, 전혀 그렇지 않았어요. 일단 삼촌이 저희를 정말 잘 챙겨주셨어요. 진짜 삼촌처럼 재밌고 친절하게 대해주셔서 편안한 분위기를 만들어주셨어요. 그래서 삼촌과 시간을 보내면서 많은 이야기들도 나누고 저의 고민에 대한 조언들도 진지하게 해주셨어요. 삼촌 덕분에 정말 많은 힘을 얻었죠! 그리고 게스트 하우스에 묵었던 분들과도 밤에 옹기종기 모여서 많은 이야기를 나눌 만큼 분위기가 너무 좋았어요! 또한 숙소 시설은  지내기 편안했어요. 1층 2층으로 나눠져 있고, 조식도 준비해주셔서 좋았어요! 한 이틀 지나고부터는 내 집처럼 지냈습니다ㅎㅎ

또한 354기로 다녀온 사막투어는 제가 다녀온 여행 중에서 제일 기억에 남을 것 같아요. 제가 사막투어에 가서 가장 보고 싶었던 것이 밤하늘의 별이었는데 삼촌이 그 날의 상황에 맞게 고려를 해서 투어를 진행하셨기 때문에 정말 많은 별들을 볼 수 있었어요! 평생 볼 별을 다 본 것 같네요. 너무 좋았습니다. 뿐만 아니라 형식적인 투어가 아닌 그 날 그 날에 따라 가는 곳도 달라지고 멋진 곳이 있으면 삼촌이 차에서 내려 사진도 다 찍어주셔서 더욱 매력적이었던 것 같아요. 삼촌 사진 솜씨가 정말 대박이에요! 삼촌이 찍어준 사진 중에서 인생샷도 많이 건졌답니다! 투어를 하면서 조슈아 트리와 선인장들도 많이 보고, 오프로드 경험도 기억에 남을 것 같네요! 정말 스릴있었습니다! 재밌었어요! 저녁에는 캠프파이어를 하면서 삼촌이 삼겹살도 구워주시는데 맛있었어요ㅠㅠ그거 먹고 나서는 의자에 앉아 맥주 한 캔 마시면서 하늘에 수놓인 별들을 보는데 너무 행복했어요. 노래 틀어놓고 그냥 앉아서 아무 생각 없이 하늘을 바라보는데 별똥별도 많이 떨어지고, 별자리들도 선명하게 보이고, 그 곳에 있는 것 자체가 너무 꿈만 같았어요! 그렇게 별을 바라보면서 삼촌과 사막투어 동기들과 이야기를 나누다보면 시간이 금방 갑니다ㅎㅎ 그 정도로 지루할 틈 없이 재밌었어요! 푸른솔 게스트 하우스 오시는 분들 사막투어 정말 추천해드려요!

그리고 저와 친구는 삼촌과 함꼐 솔뱅&산타바바라 투어도 다녀왔어요. 저희는 운전을 못해서 갈 수 없던 곳을 삼촌이 데려다주시고, 저희가 아울렛도 가고 싶어 했는데 그것도 고려해주셔서 투어 일정에 아울렛도 추가해주셨어요! 그래서 쇼핑까지도 할 수 있었습니다! 항상 저희가 하고 싶은 것을 먼저 생각해주시는 삼촌입니다ㅠㅠ 솔뱅을 가서는 덴마크를 여행 온 듯한 느낌을, 산타바바라에 가서는 스페인에 온 듯한 느낌을 받으면서 유럽마을을 경험했어요ㅎㅎ 삼촌이 투어를 해주시면서 역사 얘기도 해주셔서 유익했어요! 그 뿐만이 아니라 많은 재밌는 일화들을 이야기 해주셨죠. 시간 가는 줄 몰랐습니다! 또한 삼촌이 점심, 저녁도 사주셔서 너무 감사했어요ㅠ

저는 미국 여행이 처음이라서 일정을 어떻게 짜야할지 고민을 많이 했었는데, 삼촌이 많이 도와주셨어요. 유니버셜 스튜디오 티켓도 저렴하게 살 수 있는 곳을 알려주시고, 어디를 가면 좋은지 추천도 많이 해주셔서 일주일 동안 정말 알차게 시간을 보냈어요! 한국 오는 비행기 시간을 바꾸고 싶었을 정도로 너무 좋았습니다ㅠㅠ 저는 하루빨리 여행 경비를 마련해서 다시 삼촌 뵈러 갈 예정입니다! 푸른솔 게스트 하우스 정말 추천해드려요:)</review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<rate>5</rate><text>(Translated by Google) Desert Tour 363 Days ~
I visited Korea Town with a map of Korea and I saw a nice Korean hostel. It was not hygienic for me to stay in the old place, so I went to the hotel to talk with my uncle about tour. ~ It is not like a real business mind, but a haven operated by my uncle who has a mind of traveler.
Sometimes I read things with bad ratings to be rated ... especially security issues, real security is good. Cctv Do not go out to the front door of the furniture. He said that only when he / she informs his / her acquaintance of his / her accommodation password. If your uncle should not do this to the guest, just talk to him like a knife, and allow me to understand it. Sometimes there are a lot of strange sentiments. I really ... It is not such a place. If you hesitate because of that later, I think you should choose without worry.
I can not tell the tour. I can not forget the stars I saw staring at the real night. It was so good that it seemed too short for about 4 hours to star in the stars. This is a real trip if you are touring elsewhere. If you want a tour of the outlets, listen to the explanation and do not apply! But if you want to travel with your uncle to see the stars and eat sandwiches in the desert and go up to the sandy desert, it is recommended to try it if you are in the west of the US!

Finally uncle! That's Yun Jin!
I went to the Grand Canyon tour,
The stars I saw in the desert were the best on this trip. Thank you so much for giving me good memories.
Always be healthy. Always happy.
I hope to see you again soon.

사막투어 363기입니당~
구글지도로 한인타운 구경하다가 반가운 한국숙소가 있길래 눌러봤다가 평점이 너무 좋아서 사막투어가 있다는거 알고 방문했습니다! 기존에 숙박하던 에어비앤비가 위생적으로 별로였어서 삼촌이랑 투어 얘기하다 숙소까지 옮겼어요~ 정말 장사꾼 마인드가 아니라 여행자의 마인드를 가진 삼촌이 운영하는 안식처 같은 곳입니다ㅠㅠㅠ 토마스 삼촌 진짜 너무 좋아요...
간혹 평점 중에 되게 안좋은 별점이 있는 것들을 읽었는데... 특히나 보안문제, 진짜 보안은 잘되어 있어요. Cctv 다 돌아가구 앞문으로 출입도 안합니다. 숙박하시는 분들이 자기 지인에게 숙소 비밀번호를 알려주는 경우에만  일이 생긴다고 하시더라구요. 삼촌이 그런경우에 해당 손님에게 이러시면 안된다구 바로바로 칼같이 이야기하시구요, 또 이해 가능한 부분에 대해서는 허용해 주셔요. 가끔 몇개씩 이상한 후기 많은데 정말... 그런 곳아니니 그런 후기 때문에 망설이신다면 고민없이 선택하시는데 좋을 것 같아요
투어는 말할 것도 없습니다..진짜 밤에 돗자리깔고 쳐다본 별들은 못잊어요. 별들이 쏟아진다는게 이런거구나 싶습니당 ㅜㅜ 별 보이는 4시간 정도가 너무 짧게 느껴질정도로 좋았어요. 다른 곳에서 하는게 투어라면 이건 진짜 여행입니다. 버스타고 돌아다니면서 내렸다 탔다 설명듣고 아울렛들르는 그런 투어를 원하신다면 신청하지마세요! 그치만 삼촌과 같이 별보고 사막에서 삼겹살 구워먹고 모래사막 오르는 여행다운 여행 원하시는 분들은 미서부가면 꼭 해보시길 추천합니다!

마지막으로 삼촌! 저 윤진이에요!🤠
그랜드캐년투어까지 다녀왔는데 역시는 역시
사막에서 본 별들이 저는 이번 여행에서 가장 좋았습니당 좋은 추억 선물해주셔서 너무 감사해요
언제나 건강하시구 항상 행복하기만하세요
또 뵐 수 있는 날이 빨리 왔으면 해요❣️< /text>< GmapID>

(Translated by Google) Desert Tour 291 Seolnuri!
First of all, the desert tour is amazing! The stars are so pretty that you can't capture everything with your eyes 😚 Thank you Uncle Thomas once again ㅜㅜ It was an unforgettable memory.. ((I want to go again...
And the location of the guest house is great and Uncle Paul and Uncle Thomas are really friendly!! Before that, I stayed at another Korean bed house, but the room is very clean compared to that place! My uncles are so kind that I have a very comfortable stay.
The toilet is shared, so it is a bit uncomfortable, but if you set the time well, you can use it without any inconvenience.
Please go to the desert tour again!!!! It’s not a lie, it’s really cool.

<Text>(Translated by Google) I stayed for a week. The tips of the owners' sweet spots and the life story of drinking beer in the evening were so good. In addition, the desert tour was an inspiring experience that I could not feel during my long trip to the United States. It was great because it was included in the morning at a reasonable price. Have a nice trip

일주일정도 묵었습니다. 주인삼촌분들의 자상한 엘에이 스팟 조언들과 저녁에 시간되면 맥주마시면서 하는 인생이야기들이 너무 좋았습니다. 추가적으로 사막투어는 장기간 미국여행에서 느낄 수 없었던 감동적인 경험이었습니다. 저렴한 가격에 아침까지 포함되어 있는 숙소라 더욱 좋았습니다. 여행 즐겁게 하세요<//Text>< pics>

(Translated by Google) 2 nights 3 days I wanted to see as much as possible on a very short trip to LA and feel a lot about LA.

In the meantime, I think the Bluesol Guest House I chose was the best choice for this trip.

Of course, the Hollywood streets and Venice beaches were good,
The desert tour with the people of the guest house was great.

I knew that the size of the American national park was large,
I felt more than just feeling into the nature.

Boil pork belly and ramen in the middle of the desert
You will never forget the beer you drink while watching the stars in the night sky.

Especially since the boss is so kind and uncle-like
It was so good. The photos you took with the stars in the night sky became life photos. (The president kindly takes pictures of each person and keeps taking pictures.)

Highly recommended.

2박3일 아주 짧은 LA여행에 최대한 많은것을 보고싶었고 LA를 많이 느끼고 싶었습니다.

그 와중에 선택한 푸른솔 게스트 하우스가 이번 여행에서의 최고의 선택이였다고 봅니다.

헐리우드 거리나 베니스 비치도 물론 좋았지만
게스트하우스 사람들과 함께 떠나는 사막투어가 너무나도 좋았습니다.

미국 국립공원의 크기가 크다는것은 알고있었지만
대자연의 품속으로 들어가 느끼는 감정은 그 이상이였습니다.

사막한가운데에서 삼겹살과 라면을 끓여먹고
밤하늘의 쏟아지는 별들을 바라보며 마시는 맥주는 절대 잊지못할겁니다.

특히나 사장님이 너무 친절하시고 삼촌같아서
너무나 좋았습니다. 밤하늘 별들과 함께 찍어주신 사진은 인생사진이 됬습니다. (사장님이 친절하게 한명 한명 몇장을 찍던 계속 찍어주십니다.)

강력히 추천합니다.< /Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Hello. He has been staying at the Blue Sol Guesthouse for the past few days. It was the first Korean people I used during my trip to the United States, but it was so good!
The atmosphere of the guest house is good, the boss is very friendly (later everyone would call me uncle later), and he gave me a lot of information, and it seemed that all the guests would like to have a good trip and go!
Above all, I went to Joshua Desert Tour program and it is the best !!!
It's an experience that's hard to do elsewhere.
If you feel like just sightseeing in other travel agencies, you really feel like traveling here !!! I go with other parties, but it's going to be a minority, so I get really close and it's fun and exciting with my friends for 2 days and 1 night!
The Joshua Desert Tour is highly recommended because you'll know if you go.
The location of the accommodation is not far from the main Korean town street or downtown, and the bus stop is also nearby. The atmosphere of the hostel is also good !! Then have a good trip !!

안녕하세요. 지난 몇일동안 푸른솔게스트 하우스에 묵었던 사람입니다. 미국여행 중 처음으로 사용했던 한인민박이였는데 너무 좋았어요!
민박집 분위기도 좋고, 사장님도 너무 친절하시고 (나중엔 그냥 다들 삼촌이라고 부르게되더라구요ㅎㅎㅎ), 정보도 많이 주시고, 정말 모든 숙박자들이 좋은 여행하고 가길 바라시는 것 같더라구요!
무엇보다, 조슈아사막투어 프로그램을 다녀왔는데 정말 최고!!!
다른데서는 하기 힘든 경험 여기서 하게 됩니다.
다른 여행사에서는 그냥 관광하는 느낌이라면, 여기서는 정말 여행하는 느낌!!! 다른 일행들이랑 같이 가지만, 소수로 가는거라 정말 금방 친해지고 1박2일 친구들끼리 재미있고 신나게 실컷 즐기고 놀다 온 느낌이에요!
조슈아사막투어는 정말 강추합니다 이유는 가보시면 아실거예요ㅎㅎ
숙소위치도 메인한인타운거리나 다운타운이랑 멀지 않고, 버스정류장도 근처에 있어 좋아요~! 숙소 분위기도 좋구요!! 그럼 좋은 여행되세요!!ㅎㅎ</Text><response>None<//response><Date>1514522638359< /Date><pictures>None< /pictures>< userid>

(Translated by Google) It was a desert tour I hadn't thought of, but it was a much more fun and fantastic trip with the best guide Uncle Thomas. It was a lot cold, but it was a trip that I remembered even more because I saw the prettiest landscape and left many pictures. I will visit again the next time I go to LA. Desert Tour 321st Fighting!

생각도 안하고 있었던 사막 투어였지만 최고의 가이드 토마스 삼촌이랑 함께여서 더욱더 즐겁고 환상적인 여행이었습니다 많이 춥기도 했지만 그래도 그보다 더 이쁜 풍경을 보고 많은 사진을 남겨서 더욱더 기억에 나는 여행이었습니다. 다음 LA 가면 또 방문하겠습니다. 사막투어 321기 화이팅!<//Review>

I have used a lot of other bed and breakfasts, but I am really thankful that I was able to return home with a family feeling.

사장님 정말 좋으신 분이고 여행객들이 최대한 누릴수 있는, 그리고 누리고 싶어 하는 부분들을 너무 잘 아셔서 지내는 기간 동안 정말 편하게, 그리고 즐겁게 보냈던것 같습니다. 사막투어도 운영을 하시는데 정말 돈이 안아까울 정도로 자연의 신비함과 아름다움을 느낄수 있습니다. 다른 민박도 많이 이용해봤지만 차별화된 그런 가족같은 느낌으로 지내다 귀국할수 있었던 것 같아서 정말 감사합니다.< /Text>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) Uncle Thomas makes memorable memories to leave a review! Once my friends and I did not plan specifically in LA, I tried to go to just a few big places, but my uncle squeezed out every detail from the route ㅠㅠ So I was so grateful that I was so thankful !! And Joshua Desert Tour !!! The desert tour was influenced by the weather so much that we almost got ahead one day but fortunately the weather is getting better. And off-road, which is not as memorable as shooting stars, was on the road for the first time. I went over to the two gold subside completely cool ~~~ ㅠㅠㅠ Thank you for making memories never really forget uncle! ㅠㅠ

(Translated by Google) This is the place I visited on a business trip to the US due to work~
On the recommendation of my close brother
Cancel all the schedules originally planned
I went to the desert tour!!!

I don’t write good reviews...
It's best!!!

The desert tour is good, the accommodation is good, and these things
Leaving everything
The owner boss is so good!!!

The best value for travelers in other places
I don't think there is anything more important than that!^^

I promised to come back with my wife later
Even now
I remember the boss😊

273! Fighting!!!

업무로 인한 미국 출장으로 방문했던곳 입니다~
친한 형님의 추천으로
원래 계획했던 모든 일정을 취소하고
사막투어를 다녀왔습니다!!!

제가 후기를 잘 안남기는데...
최고입니다!!!

사막투어가 좋고, 숙소가 좋고 이런것들을
다 떠나서
주인 사장님이 너무 좋습니다!!!

타지에서 여행객 마음 제일 잘 헤아려주시는
것보다 중요한건 없다고 생각합니다!^^

나중에 제 아내와 꼭 다시 오리란 약속하고
떠나는 지금도
사장님 생각이 납니다😊

273기!!! 화이팅!!!</Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) It's been four times during my five visits to LA.
Uncle Paul Thomas Uncle are both very good people and I always meet nice people and stay in contact with them. It is especially recommended to go on a desert tour. It may be hard to meet everyone's needs, but I came back with only good memories at every visit.
I'll see you again soon!

폴삼촌 토마스 삼촌 두분다 너무 좋으신분들이고 지내는동안 항상 좋은분들 만나서 한국 들어와서도 간간히 연락 하고 지냅니다. 특히 사막투어는 꼭 가시길 추천합니다. 모든 분들의 니즈를 충족하기는 힘들지 모르나 저는 방문때마다 좋은 기억만 가지고 돌아왔습니다.

(Translated by Google) You only need to be careful here.
When I'm bored, I like to search through Google Maps where I was rocked.
I was sitting in the office and remembered less.
Since it is wooden, you only have to be careful with bedding.
The rest are all great in terms of emotion.
For those of you who don't know what Betbuck is.
You can just think of the proverb,'Everyone catches bedbugs and burns them all.'
It is characteristic of vampire bedbugs that live in wooden conditions, such as hives rising once bitten on the back. Wake up or lift your blanket to see bedbugs that have been killed with your blood. Whoo

여긴 벳벅만 조심하면 됩니다.
심심하면 누볐던 곳을 구글맵으로 뒤지는걸 좋아하는데.
사무실에 앉아 보다가 추억이 떠올라 적습니다.
아무래도 목조다보니 침구류 벳벅만 조심하면되고요.
나머지는 감성측면에서 모두 훌륭합니다.
벳벅이 뭔지 모르시는 분들은.
'빈대잡다 초가삼간 다 태운다' 라는 속담을 떠올리시면 됩니다.
한번 등에 물리면 두드러기가 올라오는 등 목조건물에 사는 흡혈빈대 특징입니다.  자고일어나 이불을 들추면 여러분의 피와 함께 깔려죽은 빈대를 보실 수 있습니다. 후후< /Text>

The owner of the guest house (everyone calls me uncle) recommended tourist attractions every day and was very flexible in handling things like check-in and check-out, so I was able to travel comfortably. And there is a desert tour from the guest house level to Joshua Tree National Park, which I would particularly recommend. I was able to see the most stars and meteors I have ever seen since I was born! The people staying here seemed to be going all the time, but it wasn't a specific schedule, but I was going on an improvised trip within my uncle's ability, so I think it was more fun and enjoyable (if the weather was bad, there may be cases where you can't help it. ㅜ)
Except for me and my friends, I didn't know everyone else, but I think I was able to get close to everyone by drinking beer that someone else bought me at night. In other places, I just stayed at a hostel or hotel with my friends. I really enjoyed it
Thanks to you, I will make good memories!

위치도 la 중심에 위치해서 이곳저곳 다니기 좋고 시설도 괜찮습니다
민박집 사장님(다들 삼촌이라고 부릅니다)께서 매일매일 관광지 추천을 해주시고 체크인 체크아웃 같은 것들도 매우 융통성 있게 처리해주셔서 편하게 다닐 수 있었습니다. 그리고 민박집 차원에서 조슈아트리 국립공원으로 가는 사막투어가 있는데 특히 권해드리고 싶네요 태어나서 본 것 중에 가장 많은 별이랑 유성을 볼 수 있었어요! 여기에 묵으시는 분들은 웬만하면 다 가는 것 같던데 특정한 일정이 정해진 게 아니라 삼촌 역량 안에서 즉흥적인 여행을 떠나는 거고 그래서 더 재밌었고 즐거웠던 거 같아요(날씨가 안 좋으면 어쩔 수 없이 못 가는 경우도 생기긴합니다ㅜ)
저랑 친구 빼고 나머지는 다 모르는 사람들이었지만 밤에 다른 분께서 사준 맥주 마시면서 다들 친해질 수 있었던 거 같아요 다른 데에서는 그냥 호스텔이나 호텔에서 묵어서 친구랑만 있었는데 이렇게 생판 처음보는 사람들과 얘기하고 경험 공유도 하는 자리도 정말 즐거웠어요
덕분에 좋은 추억 만들고 갑니다!</review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) I have never seen such a perfect guest house even though I have traveled a lot at home and abroad. It is recommended for those who like to hang out with others and those who want to share travel information with many people! If someone really wants to travel to LA, I would definitely recommend this guesthouse unconditionally!

국내외 여행을 많이 다니면서도 이만큼 완벽한 게스트하우스는 본 적이 없습니다. 다른 분들하고 어울리기 좋아하시는 분들,  많은 분들과 여행 정보 공유하고 싶으신 분들에게 추천합니다! 정말 누군가 LA에 여행을 간다고 하면 저는 무조건 무조건 이 게스트하우스를 추천하겠습니다!<//text>

There are spaces to communicate with guests on the first and second floors, and there is a parking lot at the back of the building, so car rental travelers can park safely. Breakfast, bread, cereals, eggs, bananas, juices, milk, etc. are prepared daily for the guests and cooked for lunch and dinner. The Blue Sol Guest House is highly recommended.

+ Thomas and Uncle Paul actively solved their inconveniences. You've also lived in the United States for a long time and have run a guesthouse, so you can get travel advice that you can't hear anywhere. If you have any questions, not just Los Angeles, please ask!

+ I went to a desert tour with several tours in Blue Sol, and I would recommend it to other people.
In Joshua Tree National Park, one of the world's three deserts, Joshua Tree National Park is a place you can't get anywhere like the stars embroidered in the sky, the sun rising from the horizon, and a barbecue party with loved ones. Came back with memories. If you are staying in Blue Sol, we recommend you to experience the desert tour.

호텔 수준의 객실을 기대하고 오시지 않는 이상은 편안하고 안락하게 지낼 수 있는 숙소입니다. 1층과 2층에 각각 투숙객들과 소통할 수 있는 공간이 있으며 건물 뒤편에 주차장도 있어 렌트카 여행객도 안전하게 주차가 가능합니다. 빵, 시리얼, 계란, 바나나, 쥬스, 우유 등 투숙객을 위한 조식을 매일 새벽 준비해주시고 점심과 저녁도 직접 조리해서 먹을 수 있습니다. 따뜻한 사람들과 함께 할 수 있는 푸른솔 게스트 하우스 적극 추천합니다.

+ 토마스 선배님과 폴 삼촌께서 숙소 생활에 불편한 것은 적극적으로 해결을 해주셨습니다. 또 오랜 기간 미국에서 생활하시고, 게스트하우스를 운영하셨기 때문에 어디서도 들을 수 없는 여행 조언을 얻으실 수 있습니다. LA뿐 만 아니라 궁금하신 곳이 있다면 적극적으로 물어보세요!

+ 푸른솔에서 여러 투어를 운영하는 사막투어를 다녀왔는데 다른 분들께도 추천드리고 싶습니다.
세계 3대 사막 중 하나인 모하비사막에 위치한 조슈아트리 국립공원에서 어느 곳에서도 볼 수 없었던 하늘을 수놓은 별들, 저 멀리 지평선에서 떠오르는 태양, 소중한 사람들과 함께 한 바베큐파티 등 어느 곳에서도 얻을 수 없는 소중한 추억을 얻고 돌아왔습니다. 푸른솔에 묵으신다면 꼭 사막투어를 경험해보시길 추천드립니다.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

I will keep it in my head forever ♡♡♡

(Translated by Google) Uncle Thomas !!!!!!!!!! I'm Taehong. I wanted to put a review soon, but moved too late. !!!!!!!!!! I spent a month backpacking in the US and one of my favorite guesthouses is memorable. There's nothing to say about the desert tour, and I remember still sleeping on shooting stars, the Milky Way and the rocks. And I lost my passport because my bag was stolen. My uncle helped me and made it very easy. Don't miss the desert tour. It's a waste of money and it's a truly memorable trip. Thank you so much for my uncle !!!!!! Thank you and thank you !!!!! Thank you very real really. La I'll be sure to hear it again. And please come to Korea !!!!!!!!!!!! I know why? Thank you Uncle Thomas !!!!

토마스 삼촌 !!!!!!!!!! 저 태홍이에요. 리뷰 빨리 달고 싶었는데 이사도하고 많이 늦었습니다.!!!!!!!!!! 제가 미국 배낭여행 한 달간 했는데 그 중 젤좋앗던 게스트 하우스고 기억에 남는 곳 입니다. 사막투어는 말 할것도 없고 별똥별, 은하수 그리고 돌 위에서 잠자던 기억이 아직 새록새록 한거같아요. 그리고 제가 가방을 도난 당해서 여권을 잃어버렷는데 삼촌이 도와줘서 엄청 손 쉽게 하고 만들었어요 정말 친절하시고 최고입니다. 사막투어는 꼭 하시고 가세요. 돈 아깝지 않고 정말 기억에 남을 여행입니다. 삼촌 이모도 많이 고마워 하셨어요 !!!!!! 고맙다고 전해 달래요 !!!!! 정말 진짜 진짜 감사합니다. La 다시 한번  간다면 꼭 들리겠습니다.  그리고 꼭 한국 들어가세요 !!!!!!!!!!!! 이유는 알죵 ?? 감사합니다 토마스 삼촌 !!!!< /review>

(Translated by Google) This is the first guest house where I traveled alone and stayed there for 7 days! I was worried that a woman was traveling alone, so I read a lot of reviews and made a decision after meticulous searching! It was a place that made me meet the best relationships and comfortable rooms on a trip where everything was new and unfamiliar!

Every morning, I greeted him with Uncle Paul, had breakfast, listened to advice, and ended up having a light beer with Uncle Thomas at night after having fun all day! My uncles were so friendly that I was able to have a great time with all of the people who were there!

But it was the Joshua Desert Tour that made this guest house so unforgettable for me. It was really like a family trip thanks to my uncle's desire to feel the Joshua Desert with my whole body and share the beautiful scenery, not the tour that travel agencies do!
As soon as I got out of the car, the stars pouring over my head, the endless desert, cactus and Joshua Tree that calmed my mind! The pork belly and ramen my uncle gave me was really the best!!!

This trip was one of the best trips in my youth life trip. Part of that good memory, Purunsol Guesthouse! Thank you for making such great memories! I'll see you again when I go to LA soon!! hehe

처음으로 혼자 여행을 가서 7일정도 묵었던 게스트하우스입니다! 여자 혼자 여행하는거라 걱정되어 엄청 많이 후기를 읽고 꼼꼼히 검색한 후 결정했던 푸른솔! 모든것이 낯설고 새로웠던 여행에서 저에게 편안한 방과 최고의 인연들을 만나게 해 주었던 곳 입니다!

매일 아침 폴삼촌과 인사 후 조언을 들으며 아침을 먹게되고 하루종일 신나게 논 후에 밤에는 토마스 삼촌과 가벼운 맥주한잔 마시며 하루를 마감했습니다! 삼촌들이 친화력이 정말 좋으셔서 거기 같이 계셨던분들중 한분도 빠짐없이 다 같이 즐거운 시간을 보낼 수 있었습니다!

하지만 이 게스트 하우스가 저에겐 정말 잊을 수 없는 이유를 만들어준건 역시나 조슈아 사막투어였어요. 여행사에서 하는 그런 투어가 아닌 정말 조슈아 사막을 온 몸으로 느끼고 아름다운 풍경을 같이 공유하고 싶은 삼촌의 바램덕분에 정말 가족여행같았던 시간이었어요!
차에서 딱 내리자마자 머리위로 쏟아지는 별들, 내 마음을 차분하게 해 주던 끝없이 펼쳐진 사막과 선인장 그리고 조슈아트리!! 삼촌이 해 주신 삼겹살과 라면도 정말 최고였어요!!!

이번 여행은 제 청춘인생여행에서 손 꼽힐만큼 좋았던 여행이었어요. 그 좋은 추억에 한 부분인 푸른솔 게스트 하우스! 정말 좋은 추억 만들어 주셔서 감사해요! 곧 엘에이 가면 또 뵙겠습니다!! ㅎㅎ<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Hello haha ​​I'm a college student who stayed at Bluesol Guest House. As an exchange student, I traveled to Los Angeles for about 4 days before starting the semester, but I am sorry to post it later when the semester ends. Ha ha .. So far, I've traveled all over the West, but I haven't forgotten about LA in August. !! I went to several places in Southeast Asia and came to the United States for the first time, and everything was unfamiliar and scary, but I was really impressed by recommending events or places to go and helping if possible. When I arrived for the first time, it was awkward and the facilities were just like that, and I thought it might have been better, but who knew that this was a Destiny location? Haha I hope that the place to go is just like this. I thought the guest house that I had to use was uncomfortable, but it was very good. They talked about the food called Doran Do, and went to Getty, but I met them for a few minutes, so it was fun coming together. I have my own story, and I think it was a chance to think about myself again. Oh! In particular, I can't forget the desert trip, so I highly recommend it if possible! It will be an experience that you will never regret. The impression of seeing as many stars as they lie down on the road at dawn for hours ... !!!!!!! The next day, the ramen and meat that my uncle prepared for me ... I'll never forget it ㅠㅠ Are you watching this post? Off-road is ridiculously awesome. The mechanism I've been riding? It was the funniest experience out of the way. I was able to feel thrilled and alive while running. Thank you for taking a good photo and taking good care of it. I'm very grateful even if I think about it now. He told me to pick him up and meet him again TT TT I remember everything. Thank you very much and I'm really sorry for writing it late! Keep healthy, healthy and young energy! Sincerely thank you! Blue Sol Guest House Fighting ~~~~~

게스트 하우스 혼자 갔는데 아주 만족스럽네요. 다른 여행자들과 같이 모여서  얘기도 나눌 수 있고 사막투어도 엄청 좋았습니다. 여행을 즐겁게 하려면 푸른솔 게스트 하우스 추천합니다.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

(Translated by Google) I didn't speak English well and it was my first time on my own trip to America. Everyone was in their 20s, but they could have fun regardless of age. In particular, desert tour will be a memorable one in my life. Uncle Thomas .. I'll meet you at the Blue Sol and have a beer. I hope you will thrive in the future. I will visit you again next time.

영어도 잘 안되고 미국 처음가는 혼자만의 여행에서 첫 숙소였어요. 다들 20대의 청춘이었지만 나이 상관없이 즐겁게 지낼 수 있었어요. 특히 사막투어는 제 인생에서 잊지 못하는 추억으로 남을 꺼 같아요. 친절한 토마스 삼촌..푸른솔에서 만나서 맥주마시며 마치 20대가 되어 수다떨던 여행을 잊지 못할 겁니다. 앞으로 더욱 번창하시길 바래요. 다음에 또 기회가 된다면 방문하겠습니다.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) I was looking for a place to travel to LA and decided for a desert tour. It's been almost two months since I've been there and I'm leaving it later! It's a nice place because people smell better than anywhere else ♡♡ My uncle gave me a lot of helpful information on the travel route, transportation, airport riding, and how kind it was-I was scared when I went to another lodging place. The desert tour has become an unforgettable memory of my life! I want to go to the desert tour again !!!!!! If I visit LA next time, I will go here! Thank you uncle !!

교환학생 끝나고 여행중인 24살 남학생입니다. 가격대비 너무 만족입니다. 사장님도 너무 친절하시고 머무는 내내 삼촌이라 부를정도로 친화력이 좋으시고 숙소 묵는동안 절대 방해없습니다. 긴 여정이라 계획 없이 여행중인데 연장 신청해서 더 묵고 있네요. 밤에 간단하게 맥주한잔 하며 여행정보, 동행을 구할수 있구요. 사장님이 하시는 사막투어때문에 그랜드 케니언 포기했습니다. 너무 좋았습니다.<//review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) I made really good memories at Purunsol Guest House and lived like my own home haha ​​Now I think it's more famous for desert tours, but I think the Joshua Tree National Park desert tour is definitely the best experience in the United States. The boss sets the schedule taking into account all the requirements for star viewing, such as clouds, wind, moon, humidity, and so on, so I'm sure you will have a truly fantastic experience if you enter the desert. However, it is not easy to meet the time because the schedule is not set in advance because all of the requirements must be considered. Still, if you're in LA for a long time, I highly recommend taking a desert tour.
Overall, the facilities at the guest house were satisfactory. First of all, the boss was so kind and pursued a free atmosphere, so I was able to eat, drink and do freely without harming others. And if you don't go around alone too late at night and act with common sense, it won't be a big problem. Of course, it is true that LA has poor security compared to Korea, but the location of the accommodation seems to be far from a place where security is really bad.
Uncle~~ Now, I will post a review!! I've already made all the rumors to my friends who exchanged with me ㅋㅋㅋ Next time I'll go play again~!

푸른솔 게스트 하우스에서 정말 좋은 추억 만들고 내 집처럼 지내다 왔습니다ㅎㅎ 이제는 사막 투어로 더 유명한 것 같은데, 조슈아트리 국립공원 사막 투어는 미국에서의 경험 중에 단연 최고가 아닐까 생각합니다. 사장님께서 구름, 바람, 달, 습도 등 별을 보기 위한 모든 요건들을 고려해서 일정을  짜주시기 때문에 사막에 들어가신다면 정말 환상적인 경험을 하시리라 장담합니다. 다만, 그 모든 요건들을 고려해야 하기 때문에 일정이 미리 정해지지 않아서 시간을 맞추기가 쉽지는 않습니다. 그래도 LA에 오래 계신다면 꼭 사막 투어를 하시는 것을 추천드립니다.
게스트 하우스의 시설은 전반적으로 만족스러웠습니다. 우선 사장님이 너무 친절하시고, 자유로운 분위기를 추구하시기 때문에 남들에게 피해 안 끼치는 선에서 자유롭게 먹고 마시고 할 수 있었어요.  그리고 치안은 너무 밤 늦게 혼자 돌아다니지 않고, 상식적으로 행동한다면 크게 문제가 되진 않을 것 같습니다. 물론 LA가 한국에 비해 치안이 좋지 않은 것은 사실이지만, 숙소의 위치가 치안이 정말 안 좋은 곳과는 거리가 있는 것 같습니다.
삼촌~~ 이제서야 후기 올립니다!! 같이 교환 온 친구들한테도 벌써 소문 다 냈어요ㅋㅋㅋ  다음에 기회되면 또 놀러갈게요~!</review>

I did not go to the other guest house in LA, but I could see that it was a free atmosphere. Because there is a lot of guest house in Korea, so there is atmosphere that the guesthouse is spouting. I can free check in / out time, drink in the evening and so on. Of course, you can not play freely because you are free. ㅋ If you tell your uncle, please let me know. And the desert tour is also free. Like the route from the factory, like other tours, the route is not fixed. I can go when I want to go to the place where I decided to go without a fixed time. Does this guest house feel rough? ㅋㅋ If you like a free atmosphere, I would recommend!

처음에 하루만 숙박하려고 하다가 결국 3일 숙박했습니다 ㅋㅋ 5월 말쯤에 머물렀는데 날씨도 너무 좋았구요. LA에 있는 다른 게스트 하우스는 안가봤지만 딱 봐도 자유로운 분위기라는걸 알수 있었습니다. 왜냐면 한국게스트 하우스를 많이 다녀봤기때문에 그 게스트하우스가 내뿜는 분위기가 있어요 ㅋㅋ  체크인/아웃 시간, 저녁에는 술자리 등등 프리하게 할수있어요. 물론 자유롭다고 해서 맘대로 깽판치는건 안되고ㅋㅋ 삼촌한테 말만하면 웬만하면 다 허락해주세요~ 이건  어딜가나 기본이겠죠?  그리고 사막투어도 역시나 프리하게 ~ 다른 투어처럼 공장에서 찍어내듯이, 루트가 딱딱 정해져 있는 게 아니에요. 정해진 곳, 정해진 시간 없이 가고싶은데로 갔다가 오고 싶을때 올수있어요. 대충 이 게스트하우스의 느낌이 오시나요? ㅋㅋㅋ자유스런 분위기 좋아하는 사람이라면 강추합니다!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

(Translated by Google) I loved traveling and stayed in several hotels and a few guesthouses ... but Bluesol is just a house.
I always choose the accommodation carefully because of the inconvenience of having to travel alone. I feel comfortable staying in my home in America.
It was felt that the boss of the hospitality and advice on the rings are precious than anything.

여행을 좋아해서 여러 호텔들과 몇곳의 게스트 하우스에 머물러 봤었지만...푸른솔은 그냥 집이예요.
여자 혼자서 여행다니는 불편함땜에 숙소 선택을 항상 신중하게하는 편인데요...물론 호텔의 깨끗함을 생각하고 가시면 아주조금(?)의 실망은 하실수 있지만, 가격대비 시설, 청결, 친절함은 최고네요. 미국에 있는 내 집이다 생각하고 머무시는 편안함이 푸른솔엔 있어요.
사장님의 친절함과 연륜에서 느껴지는 조언들이 그 어떤것보다 값진것이었어요.</Text>

(Translated by Google) I had the most memorable experience in the most unexpected place of my trip. When I think of the city of LA, I think the guesthouse will continue to come to mind. I want to keep the relationship with my friendly uncles for a long time. And this crab is famous for its desert tour. I visited without knowing and accidentally went to the desert tour, I think it will be memorable forever. At that time, the Milky Way and the sunrise were a good match for the real nature. This guesthouse is highly recommended if you want to stay for a long time. If you don't plan your trip, you can help by talking with your uncle and guesthouse.

여행 중 가장 기대하지 못한 곳에서 가장 기억에 남는 경험을 하고왔어요. LA라는 도시를 생각하면 이게스트하우스가 계속 생각 날 것 같아요.  친절한 삼촌들과 이곳에서 맺은 인연은 오래도록 간직하고싶습니다. 그리고 이 게하는 사막투어로 유명한 곳이예요. 저는 모르고 방문했다가 우연히 사막투어를 가게되었는데 진짜 평생 기억에 남을것같아요. 그 때 본 은하수와 일출은 진짜 대자연이라는 표현이 어울리는 곳이였습니다. 기억에 오래 남길 여행을 원하신다면 이 게스트하우스를 강력 추천해요. 또 여행 계획이 딱히 없으시다면 이 곳에서 삼촌과 게스트하우스 사람들과 함께 얘기하면서 도움 받을 수 있어요!!</text>

(Translated by Google) After immigrating to LA, I have lived in Blue Sol for over two months. The facilities are good and the surroundings such as large marts, food and convenience stores are very comfortable. :) Breakfast is served on weekdays. Towels are provided every time you need them. As I stayed for a long time, I couldn't ask for seats or covers. The boss is very free, unlike other Geha, so if you act only on common sense, you have no uncomfortable rules, and you have lived freely (?) Without being disturbed. In the evening, we gathered together to prepare a beer for our boss's sake once, and everyone was freed from the awkward air because it was Chomyeon. Thanks to this, we got acquainted with a lot of people and got good contacts. I'm immigrating, so I didn't have much idea of ​​traveling, but at first I enjoyed all kinds of courses, hot lectures, restaurants, etc. I almost lectured, and it seems like I visited all of LA's attractions before I started working. It was the best experience. I loved it so much. :)

엘에이로 이민 오면서 푸른솔에서 2달 넘게 거주했습니다. 시설도 좋고 대형 마트나 먹거리, 편의점 등 주변 환경도 좋아 정말 편하게 지냈던것 같습니다 :)  평일에는 조식도 나오고 수건도 필요시마다 무제한 제공, 방 상태도 청결하게 잘 유지되어 있습니다. 장기로 있다보니 시트나 커버 등 요구하지 않아도 외부에 나갔다 오면 교체되어 있어서 늘 깔끔하게 쉴수 있었습니다. 사장님도 다른 게하와 다르게 굉장히 자유로우신 분이다보니 상식 선에서만 행동한다면 불편한 룰같은것도 없고 뭘 하던 자유롭게 방생(?)해주셔서 간섭받는 느낌 없이 지냈습니다. 저녁때 다같이 모여 사장님 사비로 맥주 한잔 할 수 있는 자리도 한번씩 마련해주셔서 다들 초면이라 어색했던 공기 풀어주시는데 그덕에 참 많은 분들과 친해졌고 좋은 인맥들을 얻어 아직도 많은분들과 교류하고 있습니다. 저야 이민을 온거라 여행은 큰 생각이 없었는데도 이왕 온거 처음엔 좀 즐기라고 온갖 코스며 핫플, 맛집 등 거의 강의를 해주셔서 일 시작하기 전에 LA 명소는 다 돌아본것 같네요 ㅎㅎ 사막투어는 말할것도 없이 제 인생 최고의 경험이었습니다. 너무 좋아서 두번이나 갔네요 :) LA 오신다면 푸른솔 강추입니다!</text>

(Translated by Google) It was Shin Seung-soo who participated in the desert tour a week ago! I went to the desert tours three weeks ago because it was not good weather. I left the padding and left padding, but then I visited Gyeongsol recently. I think it was too good to go to the desert tour again. The barbecue that I served was delicious too, and the stars of the night sky, the off - roads, and the points to take me to the day freely that day were very good. I was not bored because I was fluent in explaining places and history in the car. Maybe you are not the most professional of Koreans in Mojave Desert. Thank you so much for having enjoyed my time so much. Please contact us if you are going to Death Valley later! I want to follow along.

삼촌 일주일 전 사막투어 참가했던 신승수입니다! 3주 전에 왔다가 날씨가 안좋아서 사막투어에 못갔었는데, 그 미련이 남아서 패딩도 다 맡겼다가 얼마 전 다시 푸른솔에 방문했었죠ㅋㅋ  다시 방문해서라도 사막투어 가길 너무너무 잘 한 것 같아요. 해주신 바베큐도 너무 맛있었고, 밤 하늘의 별, 오프로드, 그리고 자유롭게 그 날 그 날 상황에 맞게 데려가주시는 포인트들 다 너무 좋았습니다. 차안에서 장소와 역사에 대해서도 유창하게 설명해주셔서 지루할 틈이 없었습니다. 아마 모하비 사막에 관해서는 한국인들 중 가장 전문가이지 않으실까 싶습니다. 덕분에 너무 재밌게 잘 다녀왔습니다. 나중에 데스벨리 가게 되시면 꼭 연락주세요! 따라가고싶습니다ㅋㅋㅋㅋ<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Hello Samchun !!! Greetings from the military police !!!
It hasn't been a while since I saw you off, but I can't believe you're so far away.

First of all, I'll be proud of the blue brush

1. I traveled alone for the first time, and it was my first time to use a Korean-style guest house. To be honest, there are some sayings to be careful about Koreans when you go abroad. But the doubt disappears even before you go into the room. If you don't like alcohol here, you may hate it. But I don't force it ^^ Even if you don't drink, you can dare to recommend it to those who like to be in the place of drinking. And there is no touch. Sometimes, when you hear something like nagging (?) I think I just came to play with relatives. I've seen a lot of people who have brought towels separately, but I didn't even carry towels and wrote two sheets !! I couldn't go on a trip with my friend, so I lost my ticket alone. So I didn't have any plans, and I didn't have any reservations.

2. This is a desert tour you've heard a lot. Actually, I wanted to make a more convincing naming than a desert tour, but this time I had so many accidents that I failed. I did three tours on this trip, and it can be said to be the best in terms of price and content !! It's a pity that I couldn't attach a picture here, but I really want to take a picture of my uncle's life ... Thank you for the sad attitude. If you see it, you can only admire it !! Above all, star photos are the best !! I was a person who didn't have much inspiration for the stars, but I just sent a picture to the people around me and I did it. ! Is the weather a little cold or windy? Don't worry hahahaha Anything is prepared in the Afro car. And ramen for campfire, beer or pack soju for samgyeopsal, and the combination of scenery and people. Please feel it once! A lot of people have participated since the 150th period, and the number of jockeys has increased tremendously in less than a year !! I have to go again next time, and I'm doing good health management !!

3. In terms of facilities, I think it can be a man and a woman. This is the part that Samchun also admitted. However, there was nothing uncomfortable about being covered with something else. Of course, you may have to wait when you want to wash. However, if you come here expecting that you can use the bathroom like a house while using a guest house, you want to ask why you are coming calmly. If you swear about that part later, I think you can go to the hotel. Sometimes there are people who say it's dirty, but of course they could have done it when they were there, but I didn't say anything like that on the 6th! I'm so satisfied that I come and use it without any changes, so if you want to accept it, please pass it! And on the 18th of next month, maybe a cooler blue brush will be born. I'm sorry for exposing the trade secret. If you think of joining a lot of cooler people in a more stylish space, you're a little hungry. I will greet you occasionally with katok !!!

안녕하세요 삼춘!!! 헌병후배 인사드립니다!!!
배웅해주신지 몇시단 안 됐는데 이렇게 멀리 떨어져 있는게 믿기지 않네요 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ

우선 푸른솔 자랑좀 할게요

1. 저는 혼자 떠난 해외여행이 처음이었고 한인민박 이용도 처음이었습니다. 솔직히 까놓고 말해서 해외가면 한국 사람 조심하란 말도 있잖아요. 근데 입실하기 전부터 그런 의구심이 사라집니다ㅋㅋㅋㅋ다녀오신 분들은 무슴 말씀이신지 아실텐데 일단 맥주부터 시작해요! 여기서 술을 안 좋아하시는 분은 싫어하실 수도 있습니다. 근데 강요 안 해요^^ 술은 안 드셔도 술자리에 계시는 거 좋아하시는 분들 수다떠는 거 좋아하시는 분들에겐 감히 최고라고 추천드릴 수 있습니다!! 그리고 터치가 없어요. 간혹 게스트하우스에서 잔소리(?) 비슷한걸 들으면 사실 돈을 지불하고 왜 그런 소리를 들어야하나 싶을때가 있을 수 있는데요. 그냥 친척집 놀러온거 같아요 ㅋㅋ수건제약 없어요!! 지내면서 따로 수건 챙겨오신 분들 많이 봤는데 저는 수건 들고 가지도 않았고 2장씩 썼습니다!!(갑자기 고해성사..) 그리고 무엇보다 타지에서 계획없으신분들이랑 놀러다니기 좋아요! 저도 친구랑 계획하던 여행이 못 가게 되어서 홧김에 혼자 티켓 끊은거였어요. 그래서 계획도 없고 숙소예약도 하나도 안 했었는데 자연스럽게 생기게 됩니다 ㅎㅎ

2. 많이들 들어보신 사막투어입니다. 사실 저는 사막투어보단 좀 더 그럴듯한 네이밍을 짓고 싶었는데 이번에 워낙 사건사고가 많아서 실패했네요ㅋㅋㅋㅋ조슈아트리 국립공원 투어하는거에요!! 제가 이번 여행에 세번의 투어를 했는데 금액면에서도 내용면에서도 가히 최고라고 할 수 있습니다!! 이곳에 사진 첨부가 안되서 아쉬운데 정말 우리 삼촌 인생샷 찍어주시려고...안타까운 자세로 고생해주십니다ㅠㅠㅠ한편으로는 감사하고 한편으로는 짠하고ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ그 사진 보고 다 빵 터졌는데 삼춘이 찍어주신 사진 보면 감탄만 나옵니다!! 무엇보다 별사진도 최고에요!! 전 별에 대해 큰 감흥이 없던 사람이었는데 주변 사람들한테 막 사진 보내고 그랬습니다ㅋㅋㅋㅋ저는 아침에 출발하는 228기였구요, 별을 봐야하기 때문에 삼춘이 날씨 파악해서 유도리있게 투어 진행해주시기 때문에 그냥 따라가시면 됩니다!! 조금 날씨가 춥다?바람이 분다? 걱정하지 마세요ㅋㅋㅋㅋ어프로드 차에 뭐든 준비되어있습니다. 그리고 캠프파이어에 먹는 라면, 삼겹살에 맥주 또는 팩소주,,,안 좋을 수 없는 조합에 풍경과 사람들. 한 번씩 꼭 느껴보세요!! 150기 이후로 많은분들이 참가하셔서 일년도 안 된 사이에 엄청나게 기수가 늘고 있다는데요!! 저도 다음에 또 가야하니가 삼춘 건강관리 잘하구 계세요!!

3. 시설면에서는 솔직히 남자와 여자 갈릴 수도 있다고 생각해요. 삼춘도 인정한 부분이구요ㅋㅋㅋ근데 다른거로 커버가 되니까 불편한 점은 전 없었어요. 물론 씻고 싶을때 기다려야 될 수도 있어요. 근데 게하나 민박 이용하는데 집처럼 화장실 쓸 수 있을거라는 기대하고 오신다면,,,저는 냉정히 왜 오시냐고 여쭤보고 싶네요. 그런 부분에 대해서 나중에 욕 하실거면 호텔로 가시면 될 거 같아요. 가끔 지저분하다고 하시는 분들도 계시다는데 물론 그 분들이 계실 때는 그러실 수도 있었게지만 제가 6일 있으면서 그런 말 한 번도 안 나왔어요! 저는 너무 만족하고 와서 가감없이 쓰는거니까 받아들이실 것만 받아들이시고 아니다 싶으신거면 패스해주세요! 그리고 다음달 18일쯤에 아마 더 근사한 푸른솔이 탄생할거에요. 영업비밀 노출해서 죄송해여 삼촌ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 더 멋져질 공간에서 더 멋진 많은 분들과 함께하실 생각하면 살짝 배아프지만ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ다음에 뵐 때까지 건강하세요 삼춘!! 가끔씩 카톡으로 인사드릴게요!!!< /Text>

Europe (London, Paris)

In the atmosphere of Thomas's friendly guest house
It was the best choice for me to meet my first companion.

후기에 다소
숙소 불편하다고 해서 걱정했는데
유럽 (런던,파리)어느 민박보다 깔끔해서 안심이었고

토마스 형의 화기애애한 민박집 분위기기 속에서
생애 첫 동행자도 만나게 해준 최고의 선택이었습니다^^<//Review>

여기 분위기는 다른 게스트 하우스 보다 끈끈하고 삼촌들 주도하에 사람들 편하게 말도 걸고 화기애애합니다 혼자오셔도 불편하지않고 새로운 사람들을 알게 되어 정말 좋아요 그리고 여기서 하는 사막투어   엘에이에서 보게되는 밤하늘과 수많은 별 정말 최고에요<//Text></record>

But when I was searching to move to the place where I handled it, I changed it. I think Lee Sun Taek was a god of mercy on this trip.

1. Cleanliness and warmth: We clean the room and toilet every day and can sleep very smoothly. There are many people who think that it is natural to clean every day. I have a heater in every room and I am really warm and I slept warmly. I know that the US does not have a heating system so I thought that it was cold and I took padding, but in short, I wear short sleeves.

2. Security and Safety: Gosol guest house is a residential area, so there is not a lot of homelessness. I was so excited that I asked about it because the security is well done ~! I have been able to travel safely thanks to it, and there are some people who say that the security is not good in the latter period.

3. Nuclear Jam: Mr. Gasthouse is really kind and friendly, so we all call it Simchon. In the evening, we can get together with Simchon and other guests for a drink. The atmosphere is very good and we can make happy memories with good people. And I gave them something to eat in the morning, so I always packed breakfast very well. Thank you.

4. Impression: The most memorable thing is the desert tour, when I switch to the Gosol guest house. You should really go on the desert tour. I did the tour of the fortress tour, and of course it was good, but the happiest happiness was the desert tour. In the rain Desert like a star I've got a grilled meat Still remember I've seen the stars more clearly than any other place I've lived in the middle of the desert,

Thank you so much for driving for us for a few hours, and thanking you so much for your food. I would have been tired in the square. Thank you for making me happy and happy memories without losing laughter. Uncle Tom I am going to go to my elderly cheerleader.

푸른솔게스트하우스에서 정말 강추입니다 저는 원래 다룬 곳에서 숙박하고 있었는데 숙소가 너무 위생이 별로였고 위치도 홈리스가 너무 많아서 힘들었었어요 근데 다룬 곳으로 옮길라고 서치하던 중에 푸른솔 게스트 하우스 후기를 보고 바로 푸른솔게스트하우스오 바꿨습니다 저는 이선택이 이번 엘에이 여행에서 신의 한수였다고 생각합니다

1. 청결과 보온 : 매일매일 방이랑 화장실 청소를 해주셔서 굉장히 뽀송하게 취침할 수 있습니다 매일청소하는것이 당연하다고 생각하시는 분들 많으실 텐데 푸른솔 이전에 있던 숙소는 방청소릉 안해주더라구요..쓰레기도 그대로있고 근데 푸른솔은 매일 청결한 상태를 유지해줍니다 또한 각방마다 히터가 있어서 진짜 너어어어무 따뜻하게 잤어요 미국은 알다시피 난방 시스템이 부족합니다 그래서 춥게 잔다고 생각하고 패딩을 챙겨갔는데 푸른솔에서는 반팔입고 잡니닼ㅋㅋㅋㅋ

2. 보안과 안전 : 푸른솔게스트하우스는 주택가라서 홈리스가 진짜 거의 없어요 저도 너무 신기해서 여쭤봤더니 보안이 철저하게 잘되어있기 때문이래요~! 덕분에 안전한 여행할 수 있었습니다 그리고 간혹가다가 후기에 푸른솔 보안이 안좋다고 하시는 분들이 있는데 여기 보안 진짜 철저합니다

3. 핵잼 : 개스트하우스 사장님이 진짜 너무 친절하시고 친근하게 대해 주셔서 저희는 모두 심촌이라고 부를 정도입니다 저녁에 심촌과 다른 게스트들과 술한잔하면서 친해질 수 있습니다 분위기가 너무 좋고 좋은 사람들과 행복한 추억 만들수 있습니다 그리고 아침에 먹을 것들을 주셔서 아침도 항상 든든하게 챙겨먹었습니다 감사해요 삼촌💓

4. 감동 : 제가 푸른솔게스트하우스로 바꾸면서 가장 기억에 남는 것은 사막투어입니다 여러분 사막투어 정말 꼭 가셔야해요 제가 요새미티투어 캐년튜어 다 했는데 물론 다 좋았지만 가슴이 벅차게 행복했던 것은 사막투어입니다 죠슈아트리사막과 모아비 사막에서 별보고 같이 고기 구워먹고하는 그 기억이 아직도 생생하네요 어떤 다른 곳보다 별을 가장 많이 선명하게 볼 수 있었어요 아직도 사막 한복판에 누워서 본 별이 눈앞에 아른거리네요

토마스삼촌 저진윤이에요 삼촌이랑 같이 웃고 떠들고한 시간이 벌써 그리워요 ㅠㅠ 몇시간동안이나 저희를 위해서 운전하시고 음식까지 챙겨주셔서 너무너무 감사해요광장히 피곤하셨을텐데 항상 웃음 잃지않고 즐겁고 행복한 추억 만들어주셔서 감사합니다 삼촌 항상 건강하세요!!백년만년사세요!!ㅎㅎ 삼촌뵈러 또 엘에이 놀러갈게요❣️< /Text>< response>

(Translated by Google) It was a really happy trip every moment.
As I stayed in Purunsol from 11/16 to 11/21, I think I could feel the impact of accommodation on my trip once again.

1. Desert Tour

I slept for 2-3 hours as soon as I arrived on the 16th, and even though I departed immediately after being tired, I never felt tired for a moment until the desert tour was over the next morning. Even the sunrise I watched while it was getting bright was really perfect... Seeing it separately, my uncle took a pretty picture, and after watching the sunrise, the pork belly burned warmly and grilled right in the fire in the desert is really...👏🏻 Please make sure to visit all of them. I hope I can't express everything in writing, but it was more than I imagined😭💕

2. Accommodation

I used a dormitory for two with two friends, but it was nice to have a queen bed and a bunk bed so I could choose the bed I wanted to use and relax!
While traveling in various countries, I know how important it is to relieve fatigue at the accommodation when you come to the accommodation after a full day trip, but this trip has a tight schedule every day, and when you come to the accommodation, you can relax comfortably, so I was able to digest the schedule for the next day without fatigue.
During the desert tour, the riders of the same desert tour stayed together all day and became friends. After that, thanks to my uncle, I had a lot of fun talking with everyone who stayed in the guesthouse every night after a schedule.
Even if we eat dinner and drink together at a guest house, this comfortable and fun atmosphere lasts every day, but it's not easy, but it was always nice that my uncle made it all together without any awkwardness at all!!!
It was every day that the desert tour riders became more sticky with each other and were so good even with those who didn't go together...💕

3. Facilities

The female dormitory is located on the first floor, so it would be more comfortable when using the shower, toilet and dryer inside the dormitory!
We had a double room on the second floor, so it was on the same floor as a male dormitory, but there was no inconvenience in using the shower and toilet at all. I went to several Korean guesthouses and guest houses, but shampoo, soap, cleansing foam, especially body wash!! There are many places that are not there, but it is always arranged so I used it without worry. La felt dry, so I think it would be nice to take extra hair essence or treatment!
The dryer is located inside the shower on the first floor and next to the washbasin in front of the bathroom on the second floor.
There are many people who offer breakfast as short as 8:00-9:00, but you can use it in abundance from 7:30 to 10:30. You can prepare bananas, bread, etc. before or after meal time, or put it on the table anytime. I was able to eat comfortably when I woke up hahaha

4.Others
It was a desert tour, a trip that took only a large frame except for Disneyland tickets, but when I arrived and checked in, my uncle also recommended itinerary and what day would be more advantageous when I go to where! He gave me some tips, so I watched the Disney fireworks that I couldn't see haha
I arrived in Korea yesterday and it was already a good place to want to go again.
Please come and take a desert tour and have a beer at night and have fun!!
Even those who are worried about being noisy because they drink beer every night don't have to worry at all. Those who are tired from eating and drinking after closing all the doors in the living room are no problem when sleeping first!! Originally, I slept at 11 o'clock when I went on a trip, too, so I got to play without sleeping here, but 😂

Thank you so much for your uncle, I'm going well, I'll definitely come back with 316th !!Thank you💕

정말 매순간이 행복했던 여행이였습니다ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
11/16-11/21 까지 푸른솔에서 지내면서 또 한번 숙소가 여행에 미치는 영향이 얼마나 큰 지 느낄 수 있었던 것 같아요.

1.사막투어

16일날 도착하자마자 2-3시간 자고 피곤한 상태에서 바로 출발했는데도 불구하고 다음날 오전에 사막투어가 끝날 때까지 한순간도 피곤하다고 느낀적이 없었어요😭 정말 투어 내내 시간 가는게 아까워서 해가 안떴으면 좋겠다는 생각뿐이였는데 날이 밝아오면서 보는 일출마저도 정말 완벽했습니다...별도보고 삼촌이 사진도 예쁘게 찍어주시고 일출까지 보고나면 따듯하게 모닥불키고 사막에서 그 불에 바로 구워먹는 삼겹살은 정말...👏🏻 제발 모두 꼭꼭 다녀오셨으면 좋겠습니다ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅜ 글로 다 표현 할 수는 없지만 상상 그이상이였어요😭💕

2. 숙소

친구랑 2명이서 2인용 도미토리 썼는데 퀸베드 하나,이층침대 하나 있어서 쓰고 싶은 침대 골라서 편하게 쉴 수 있어서 좋았어요!
여러나라 여행을 다녀보면서 하루종일 여행 끝나고 숙소왔을 때 피로감을 숙소에서 푸는게 얼마나 중요한지 너무 잘 알고 있는데 이번 여행은 하루하루 빡빡한 일정 보내고 숙소오면 편하게 쉴 수 있어서 다음날 일정도 피로감없이 소화할 수 있었습니다.
사막투어동안 같은 사막투어 기수끼리 하루종일 붙어있으면서 친해지고 그 이후에도 삼촌 덕분에 일정후에 밤마다 게스트하우스에 지내는 모든 분들이랑 맥주마시면서 얘기하고 너무 재밋었어요ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
게스트하우스에서 같이 저녁먹고 술먹고 한다고해도 이런 편하고 재밋는 분위기가 매일매일 지속되는데 쉬운게 아닌데 삼촌이 처음 온 분들도 전혀 어색하지 않게 다 어울어지게 해주셔서 항상 좋았습니다!!!
사막투어 기수들끼리는 더 끈끈하게 친해지고 같이 다녀오지 않으신 분들과도 너무 좋았던 매일매일이였어요...💕

3. 시설

여성 도미토리는 1층에 있어서 도미토리 안쪽에 있는 샤워실,화장실 및 드라이기 사용하실 때 더 편할꺼같아요!
저희는 2인실이 2층이라 남성 도미토리랑 같은층이였는데 샤워,화장실 사용에 정말 전혀 불편함 없었습니다. 여러 한인민박,게스트 하우스 다녔었지만 샴푸,비누,클렌징폼 특히 바디워시!! 없는 곳도 많은데 항상 배치되어 있어서 걱정없이 사용했습니다. La가 건조하게 느껴졌어서 헤어에센스나 트리트먼트정도는 추가로 가져가도 좋을 것 같아요!
드라이기는 1층은 샤워실 안쪽에 2층은 화장실 앞 세면대 옆에 있는데, 사용할 때 필요하면 방에 가져와서 쓰고 바로 제자리에만 놓으면 되어서 편하게 사용했습니다 ㅎㅎ
조식시간도 보통 8:00-9:00 정도로 짧게 제공하는 분들이 많은데 여기는 7:30부터 10:30까지 넉넉하게 이용할 수 있고 바나나,빵 등등 식사시간 전후로도 미리 차려주시거나 더 식탁위에 올려두어 주셔서 언제 일어나든 편하게 먹을 수 있었어요 ㅎㅎㅎ

4.그 외
사막투어,디즈니랜드 표 정도만 빼고 큰 틀 정도만 잡고 떠난 여행이였는데, 도착해서 체크인 할 때 삼촌께서 일정추천도 해주시고 어느 곳에 갈 때 어떤날이 더 유리한지!! 꿀팁들도 알려주셔서 하마터면 못 볼뻔했던 디즈니 불꽃놀이도 잘 보고왔습니다 ㅎㅎ
한국에 어제 도착했는데 벌써 또 가고싶을정도로 좋았던 곳입니다ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ
제발 꼭 가셔서 사막투어도 하시고 밤에 맥주드시면서 재밋게 보내다와주세요ㅠㅠ!!
밤마다 맥주마시고 한다해서 시끄러울까봐 걱정하시는 분들도 전혀 걱정 안하셔도 되는게 거실쪽에서 다 문닫고 먹고 마셔서 피곤하신 분들 먼저 주무실때도 아무런 문제 없어요!! 원래 여행가면 11시에는 자는 저도 여기서는 너무 재밋어서 안자고 놀게 됐지만 😂

삼촌 너무 감사히 잘 지내다 가요ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ316기 꼭 다시 같이 올께요!!감사합니다💕</Text>

This post office has dedicated people working and retired ones too. Get to know them. I know them by name, they have name tags and they have lives too. Put your feet in their shoes, with your bad attitudes of waiting they have to still serve you. You have the luxury of whining. So be nice.< /review>

People need to get over themselves and realize that not all their issues with service are this offices fault. Never had an issue here or at any other local location. Also, political beliefs have no place in reviews, people are just ridiculous.</Text>

Only wanted to know how long the lobby was open to be able to collect my box mail. Here is for anyone else curious (it wasn't always open 24 hrs - in the past, I missed the cutoff time & was closed in the PAST).

Received a note at my door that my package was ready for pickup at this location, stood in line for ~15 minutes, and then the clerk informs me that my package is still on the truck. Other than that one personal experience, the clerks are rushed, difficult  to understand, and it is dirty. Also, the entrance to the postal office can be easily missed. On a positive note, there is plenty of parking!</Review>

<review>I filed a claim with them after not receiving my package even though it had been “out for delivery” for a week. I had a missed call from them yesterday, regarding my package. I called back within 20 minutes of the missed call and no one answered. I called multiple times throughout the day and not once did anyone answer. I’ve been calling today and the first few times it wouldn’t even ring. The last time I called it started ringing and STILL got no answer.< /review><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c3345d889b0823:0xbad812b2798d1e9f< /GmapID><pics>None</pics><Name>Diana C<//Name></record></dataset><record>

<Text>If I could give this postal branch 5 negative stars, that still would not be enough. So back in May 2020 I purchased an item on ebay and I received an alert when the package delivered I immediately went to my mailbox and the package was not there, because in the past I've received packages that belonged to a neighbor from the street behind me with my same street #"s I walked over there and my neighbor checked there were letters she had received in her mailbox but no package. I contacted my local postal branch customer service which is a total joke, they told me they would research it and when I talked to them I was told by Julieta that she could see it was delivered to an address across the street from my house (already acknowledging that they screwed up). I was told they would still have to reach out to the letter carrier. Well today 6/4/20 I spoke to another customer service rep Nancy, and I was told that since it was not insured and I could not file a claim even though they admitted to misdelivering it totally there fault, "there was nothing I could do". I have seen the horrible reviews for this postal branch and I can only think that  maybe they have some dishonest letter carriers that know when there is no insurance on a package that its a free for all. Again this is my personal opinion pretty sad we can't trust our postal service to do a decent job.</Text>< resp>

<review>The worst post office I've seen yet. 3rd time where they mark my packages as delivery attempted when I've been home all day for 3 different occasions. Today they did that early morning and later on the postal worker came to deliver a different package. Time to open a 3rd claim and get no response as usual. UPS is the way to go!<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>Terrible. Passport services hours posted do not reflect that they are now by appointment only. Only the hours that services are rendered. Checked the times. Got what we needed came back... was told, even though the lobby was pretty empty, that an appointment was required after you first came into the post office at 830 am and stood in line. Two trips for one thing that could have been easily rendered. The man behind the counter gave me a full on story about how people broughtg I  a ton of kids and were waiting everyday. How the kids ran around and cried and the people applying had other places to be.... which had no bearing on our situation as we were two adults... no kids and the place was empty. He made some type of excuse about only being able to do 17 passports a day.... don't waste your time.</Review>< resp>

This review is only for Cindy at this location. Asked a question about package shipment at her desk, she was impatient and answered "I don't know, you should figure out by yourself". FYI, I was the only one in line and no one else behind me. That's her attitude to customer!!!  I left and drove to another location, my package went through the system within just 1 minute, no hard time, no bad attitude.<//review>

The staff or employees customer service is horrible, at this postal location. Very rude. Even so much to say disrespectful. I don't understand why. Please please please talk to these employees. Have meetings with them about having pride for the neighborhood, better work ethic, customer service can be improved drastically and so easily.</review>

This post office has its own parking lot and usually not too packed.  The staff that work here provided excellent customer service, better than most other post office that I been too.

Wish other post office follow this one as a good lead example to the rest.  However, there's no self service machine here.<//Review>

This place was actually open until the time that's posted, so that was a plus. The man at the counter noticed I was just waiting in line to drop off a package so he called me up right away.  Only took about 5 minutes to get in an get out. No complaints .<//Text>

The front office is excellence. The back office for business drop off is terrible, they starts the new practice to limit the drop off, so all the clerks can be lazy and not loading any mails. All they want is to going home earlier and not take care of customers. Especially,  one of the big, heavy lady, she always boss customers and clerks in front of people.
They should go back to the basic, serve the customers, and provide some more friends drop off services.<//Text>

<Review>By mistake i left a UPS package here at this location.  After not receiving updates on The tracking number i went back to the location. My understanding is when packages that can not be scanned they hold at their location and notify fedEx or UPS to pick up their packages. What should have happend was UPS would have been contacted to pick up my item.  I was told UPS had already picked up several items. Once UPS came in contact with my pckage i would have started receiving updates.  Thats not what happen.  My item is lost or stolen at this moment. I have been given different stories from several different emoloyees here.  I spoke to the gentlemen i originally handed my package to.  He stated its not their job to verify the correct lables.  He stated my package was sent to city of industry.   Another employee stated its not possible the item got sent to City of Industy because they would have needed to scan it. And because the item was UPS lable not possible for it to leave the Ontario Location. She also stated UPS would have gotten it by now since they have been their already. The only thing that makes since is my package is lost in the Ontario location and no one can find it. Or it was stolen.   Over all the expierence here  has shown me that these employees dont care about ther job and dont take pride. They all have sent me away.  But On my third visit one gentlemen that worked there did the right thing bu taking down my contact info. Im thankful that he at least tried to help.<//Review><Name>Art Trujillo<//Name><Resp>None</Resp><Pics>None</Pics>< time>

< Review>
Horrible customer service!! I showed up @ 1:15 to receive my passport & the man who worked there who was of Asian descent refused to help me. Their cutoff time for passports is 3 pm & so I asked him why he would not help & he said it was because there were 2 people in front of me (who just so happened to be Asian as well). I went to another post office & it took 10-15 tops to receive my passport. I believe the man was racist.. never going to this post office again.</Review>

Postal service is holding mail with no explanation what so ever, only thing that was massaged was address is wrong on package. Asked what was wrong no answer. Tracking information is given to them nothing as of yet.<//text>

They almost always put the sign up "broken" on drop off window and make people miss the pickup if you can't make it to the inside at 5pm. Lazy people as with most USPS places! I am gonna take photo and post it. It has been 2 months since they don't have a sign up! Terrible organization in this aspect.</Text>

I have a long term problem with my mail delivery.  The mail man always send our mail to a exact address as ours; our address says North Carlos with the same house number and zip code.   And some other family's have the same address instead of North carlos they live in south carlos.  I do not know why the post office pay more attention with their delivery.  I AM MISSING A LOT OF MAIL DUE TO THEIR LACK OF ATTENTION.  this is not good because some one else receives all my confidential mail.</review>

<Text>Perhaps the worst post office in the country. Congratulations
One of the few that their mail carriers can’t read and deliver to the correct address two days in a row....I’m not kidding or exaggerating. True story, unbelievably incompetent. Never seen anything like them before.<//Text>< pics>

<Review>I've been trying to get in touch with this post office for 3+ hours (calling nonstop) to follow up on intercepting a package I submitted a request for that has been apparently ignored and have been put on hold more than once over an hour.  It's impossible to speak to anyone at this facility...  >:(  I'm not sure why they even have phones...< /Review></record>

After waiting for one hour to process a passport application the supervisor came out and told us that they would not help us because it was too busy and and they where short staffed, ask her for her name to file a complaint but wouldn't give it to me.let me make it clear averybody else was nice and polite except the supervisor , totally rude.</Review>

<Text>The service used to be okay here. It became a totally unpleasant place to visit ever since the Asian lady who looks like a customer service supervisor started to appear. She's extremely rude unless you speak Chinese. Also the way she manages things seems inefficient.  The wait line is long especially if you want to pick up a parcel. The delivery status is no longer accurately recorded. It's a total mess. Avoid this branch.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

It doesn't even deserve one star ! I call and no one answers ! And on top of that they are full of mess ! I literally sat on my balcony to see if they were going to bring my package that I had to sign for and they didn't even come near my door . I called after them and they just smirked and left (people in charge of the Waverly Apartments mail in Ontario CA) I kept a look out . And before that I even went and asked to see if they would give me my package !!! But noo instead I have to give a bad review because people can't do their job !! I'm pissed !! Beyond it for that matter !!! This is the second time !!!! They are such liars !</text>

I was craving quality pizza for a while now and decided to choose this place over others. It did not disappoint me at all--in fact, I will definitely be coming back again. The pizza was so delicious, and the price is reasonable too. I highly recommend the BBQ Hawaiin. The pizza was ready faster than I had anticipated, so that is a plus.</text>

I've been going to this place for decades. Unfortunately it has gone down hill. Service? What service? Rude during phone order, even more rude during pick up. Got the pizza home and it was chewy! Had to bake it again 😠<//Review>

<Text>Absolutely my favorite pizza place in town!! We used to order from them all the time in Milpitas, & that location moved so are unable to order delivery anymore from there.
I just happened to be at the dentist & as I was walking out, saw that one of the neighboring stores was a Fast Pizza!  Even with my left side of my mouth numb, we ordered a pizza and devoured it while still in the parking lot!  Absolutely delicious... reasonably priced, fast & courteous service, no cheap ingredients, & one of the best pizzas you will get in San Jose.  Definitely recommend!!!<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

The worst pizza I have ever had. Maybe because I'm visiting from another state but this pizza is not good. We disliked the sauce , the cheese, the wings were soggy & not what I expected at all.</Text>

Excellent fast service. Very honest and trustworthy. It's hard to find a smog shop that won't rip you off or fail you when they shouldn't. I highly recommend Smog Experts on Union Street in Victorville....go there first.<//text>

<Text>If your reading reviews to see who you can trust and wont waste your day this is the expert to see. Smog experts has been smogging all our trucks and cars professionally. He pays attention, greets his customers and is very smart at their profession, what impresses me the most...in 10 yrs i have had many vehicles with smog issues that he recommends might not pass before we start testing and he has never proposed or tried to do anything illegal to make a sale. A 'by the book company', thats professionalism and your in and out quick, but im patient. They also have a location in hesperia thats top class as well.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c36445d1d15fb7:0xc25b215ff906bf0d< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

First time went with my brother and two friends all were dressed well , second time with my fiancé and third as a group celebrating best friends engagement. Pricey spent about $900 on bottle service, overall crowd is okay we prefer strict dress code venues because the crowd is usually more comfortable to be around. I understand the bad reviews on dress code but this place is a private business and will let in the people that are good for business. Recommended<//Text>< gmapID>

<review>I’ll keep it simple... if you’re a guy and you’re not wearing a button up, jeans, and a pair of Clark’s they probably won’t  let you in. To be honest my girl and I were wearing very clean subtle Nike sneakers and were denied access.... meanwhile I saw other groups walk on by with converse, vans, etc. Hard to believe the rejection is simply based off shoe code. If so, it’s stupid and needs to change. Suppression of expression is real.<//review>< pictures>

As long as you go before about 7:00-8:00 there should not be any issues.  After that they start enforcing the bogus dress code which as other reviewers mentioned, does not apply to everybody. But hey, at least they do not turn you away for tattoos like Dive Bar does!  They have good drinks & food.<//Text>

My husband and I met with a group of friends after work fir birthday celebrations. Loved the comfortable outdoor seating, nice variety of wines and well-drinks . Really loved the brandy chicken wings and shrimp rolls. Delicious food with wonderful friends made a great evening.  Will definitely go there again.  #MiX #buzzybooth< /Text>

<Review>It wasn't bad, but not the greatest.

PROS:
Music was eclectic, truly a mix and it was fun.

Ambiance was cool, the outdoor firepits and  VIP sections looked great.

We got in for free since the hotel gave us free entrance cards.

Women's bathroom was clean and attended to by a nice lady. Slight Con: only 4 stalls.

CONS:
It was so packed, you could barely move. Honestly, didnt seem safe. A few bouncers were a little abrupt in telling us to move out of the way since we were blocking the walkway, but it felt like we just had to keep going and wedge ourselves somewhere.

There was no AC where the most people were, which was the dance floor. If there was it was weak.

It's on the second floor, up a lot of stairs, which I don't understand why clubs continue to do this to very drunk people, some of which are in heels. Obviously not something they can change or improve, but just be warned.

Facts:
Not sure if thus fluctuates, but VIP booths, we were told were $400. For a bottle of booze and the right to sit.< /Review><rate>3<//rate><Time>1565546130486</Time></record></dataset><record>

< review>
The worst club in Sacramento. I do not recommend parties to go, especially for booths. I have gone multiple times showed up at 9:30-10 and the customer service is the worse from bottle service to the front door. The employees are very disrespectful to guest and to the ones who are paying for the booths. Waste of money if you are trying to have a good night. Also they referred me to a club down the street multiple times which was better than the few times I have attended this club.</review>

Music was kind of anticlimactic for dancing, maybe it's not my style. There was a variety of people there, respectful in general. The ambience was very cool but I can't say anything about drinks. It's an ok place to dance if you like the style, and since you're not actually paying for it.< /Review>

Always loved this place. Amazing food, take advantage of happy hour for and drinks. Good dance floor, great outdoor area for mingling, just overall great place to hang out. Cover charge a bit high otherwise would get 5 stars.<//text>

<text>Every night is different.  Wednesday nights are a little older crowd,  surprisingly.   Friday nights are hit or miss.   There are people who frequent Mix a lot. So you'll see familiar faces even when you take an extended break from Mix.   I enjoy Mix because it's the only dance club I still feel comfortable at in my 40s.<//text>< userid>

I thoroughly enjoy coming here to dance. Every time has been fun music to dance to with a good DJ who knows how to mix. The weekend starts on Thursday downtown so the clubs really start going Thursday through Saturday. Avoid Wednesday nights as that seems to be when all the douches come out to dance. Come early for happy hour and enjoy Taco Tuesdays or all night happy hour on Thursdays.< /Review>

Great outside patio area. I'm a state worker, and this is a good spot to unwind and have a happy hour cocktail. Bouncers are a bit toolish, but what lounge doesn't have that? As far as the racist comments, I am multi cultural and I have never experienced or seen anything of such nature. It's simple, follow the dress code and you will have no problems!<//text>

<review>Went on a Wednesday night with some girlfriends hoping to have some fun. The bartenders were pushy and intimidating. As a woman I want to feel comfortable to ask them specifically about any drinks and what's in them. I was told not to worry about that and just enjoy. Music was just ok but the overwhelming smell in the place was disgusting. Both inside and outside smelt like the bathrooms and old garbage. We paid for a booth to get our own space only to fine garbage and sticky residue all over the seats. It looked like the booth had never been cleaned. Needless to say the night was a total bust. I won't be going to the mix ever again, and to the women that do please be careful and always be safe.< /review><gmap_id>0x809ad0d99272970d:0x82397041557288dc<//gmap_id></record>

<Text>Mikey the bartender was very professional and personable. Out of town from Tahoe and he treated my brother and I with 5 star service. Being in the fine dining and bartending business for over 21 years this guy is what makes places special and worth returning. Definitely would recommend the happy hour and the atmosphere if your down down Sac.  Great house beats too.<//Text><Date>1494132053324<//Date>< user_id>

Have never been but I'm blown away by the comments that have been posted on here.  I really hope the management team looks at these because this is HORRIBLE for business. It's not going to be easy but they better turn this place around or you are going to go out of business. By the looks of theses posts it doesn't appear to be a concern. Good luck</Text>

Have been to the Mix many times. It is the best place to go in Sacramento.  Recently went on a Thursday for Happy Hour. We had such a great time.  Loved it so much we went back the next night for 'Happy Hearts Day.' I always have fun when I go on Saturdays but hadn't been on a Friday. Had an amazing time!  The service was excellent starting from the door guys to the bartenders all the way up to management. The food is delicious and menu offers healthy and light options. The music was perfect; good variety for a wide age range to enjoy. The decor is elegant but still cozy during HH and fun and exciting during club hours. I will def be returning to the Mix.< /Review>

Pros: Great Ambiance, Great Service- servers remember your name, Great mix of ages, and types of people.  A High class place.  Food was great. Most people were nice and having fun.
Cons:  Lots of macho security men with little ear pieces walking around gave a bad vibe.  Drinks are expensive and poured with little alcohol. A little attitude going around.< /Text>

If this was the last place to club on earth i would not club. The music is censored for some reason. The bouncers are racist. Speaking good English puts them in their place. I never returned here after they showed their true color.</Text>

Example Front door: Told my friend he could not get in with his dress boots.  Thankfully he lived on 15min away but I was left waiting for him inside the club while watching MANY Whites, and Asians walked around with Tennis Shoes, Chuck Taylors, and Boots which were not near as dressy.

Example DJ: Will not play any Hip-Hop or R&B until the night is basically  over.  Mainly High Energy and Techno until after midnight.  I've asked on  3 different nights and have gotten the same answer every time.  "I will play hip-hop later"....

I gave it 2 Stars because again NOT everyone of them are racist.  The ones who are not are VERY cool genuine people.</Review>< name>

The bouncers who are absolute racist tools. Literally, by every sense of the word. Tools. The "dress code" only applies if you hit them on a good day. These are the guys you hope never become more than pathetic bouncers. If you show up with girls in tow, anything flies. Great for business? Sure. Unfortunate enough to arrive moments later than your entourage then prepare to walk away. It's one of those places that's easy to forget so when you get inside all those memories come back and you remember why you hated it in the first place.

Seriously, the bouncers? Lol</review>

Was deliberately overcharged by bartender when ordering a single beer "closed tab". She put other patrons' drinks on my bill. Politely pointed out the mistake on the spot and was assured "sorry, charge will be reversed on your CC statement in a day or two". That never happened. Had to take up issue with CC company. Take your hard-earned $ elsewhere.< /Review>

Mind you my friend gives his ID to them and just minding his business calmly waiting talking to me, they instantly then push him to the ground after viewing his ID and three men get on top of him and wrestle him down, then I asked them what is the reason why they are doing this and they were ‘accusing him of touching a girls butt that work there’. They walked him out with his hands on his head and with there arms locked in his arms. Him and I both left the building and   I just don’t believe it’s right how they approached him, they could have been like “hey the girl that works here said he touched her ass” and just tell us we need to leave and we would have left. I can tell by the way the Bouncer  approached us that he was acting like a hotshot.

Most bars and clubs I have been to , I witness security to just ask you to leave the first time and tell you why you need to without being that aggressive like these security did that night.

My stand here is that the security could have approached it differently because it was unnecessary the way they approached it.</review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<review>I came from Florida on vacation and this was the worst experience I have ever had in a night club. My Fiance reserved a booth for our group a whole week in advance and when we got there we ordered more bottles.Our total tab was over $1300.00 and the bottle waitress had the nerve to tell my fiance and his friends to tuck their chains inside their shirts. This was total discrimination because they were big black men that had nice jewelry. They also put Police officers to stand right next to our booth to watch us. My group was not loud or obnoxious everyone carried themselves with class but due to the color of our skin our money was not good there.I never knew nice chains were offensive or bothering anyone but I guess when you are BLACK at MIX it is. HORRIBLE experience never will go again.<//review>< pics>

<Review>This freaking place; where do I begin.  Everyone and their mother raves about how this is the most happening spot in midtown but under the same breath complains about 1) the long lines 2) the tools/basics 3) the expensive cover.  I personally am not fond of this place, but you have to try it once.  It's like a right of passage here.  If you want to skip cover charges, just have an early dinner and stay till the floor opens up.  I do not recommend suggesting that to a date though, since you'll look cheap.  I also don't suggest bringing a date here, because there's a high risk of them leaving with someone else</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I got a table, paid $300 for a bottle of alcohol. I drank a sip and went dancing, came back but the bottle was empty. I asked the waitress why they dont watch the tables since i paid so much, she said that they dont watch tables. Not woth getting a table cuz its not being watched. I called the manager saturday, today is monday, no phone call from the manager. This club doesn’t care about their clients.</review>

<review>Do not go.  The Mix is full of sleazy older people trying to relive the good life.
Wait staff is unprofessional and the capricious nature of thier "dress code" and admittance policy are legendary.
Attend if you want.  Not going back.< /review>< pictures>

We were in line for two hours. The bouncers told us that they would let people in once people left (“one in one out”). They didn’t let people in from the waiting line, only from the “bottle service line”. Keep in mind there wasn’t a guest list. When a group of people would leave they would let groups of girls in or their personal friends. It was the biggest waste of time. They even tried to tell people to go to the park and gave out “free entry tickets”. Never going to this place again.< /text>

<resp>None<//resp><Review>This used to be the go to club in Sacramento, however the bouncers at the front door lack professionalism and are often rude. We booked a booth for Saturday night. When we went to the entrance of the club, the Doorman ignored us for several minutes before asking us what we wanted. Once we informed him that we had booked a both his tone changed but the damage was already done. The management there should be changed. They don't have a clue on how to treat patrons.< /Review>< gmapID>

< Review>
My husband and I are both professionals in our 40's and were also an interracial couple. We were invited to the mix for a big birthday party Saturday night with about 8 other couples. I can without a doubt tell you old fashioned racial profiling is alive and well at the mix. Our large party starts being let in at 9:30pm although our reservation was for 8pm, but that’s another story. So were all filing in and my husband is stopped in his tracks and told his camel colored suede boots are not “dress code” and that he cannot come in, I of course asked what there dress code was and they say “business casual”. My husband actually left to drive home and change shoes, while this was all happening the hostess was speaking with the manager about making an exception which he finally agreed to do. However, while I waited for my husband’s return I began to notice how other guests were dressed. First I noticed a sloppily dressed white gentleman in faded jeans, faded T-shirt wearing tan loafers? I then noticed a very cute young blonde dressed in basically a men’s wife beater, faded jeans and white converses? I asked her how she got in and with a big wink told me it’s all about who you know. There are so many places to pick from when you go out and want to have a good time and spend some money and unfortunately the mix is NOT one of them.<//Review>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>If I could give zero stars I would! We went to the mix to celebrate my sister's 21st birthday. She got a booth and was already there by the time we arrived. The bouncers were giving me a hard time saying that my ID was fake and showing the other bouncers to try and get them to agree that it was 'fake' it wasn't until they saw that my husband knew one of the workers that they finally let me in. MF as*holes. A couple of weeks later, I saw on fb that the same bouncers got in trouble for being racist. hmmm.... coincidence? think not. anyone I know that ask about a club to go to, I make sure I give them my personal experience. It wasn't even all that inside either. It came off as a wannabe vegas vibe without the class.<//Review>< pics>

The "BIGGEST" Racist club you will ever go to ..... They will find every fault not to let you in because your black !!!!   ... They turning back blacks for the least even sneakers while white people up in the club in shorts and trainers lol .... that is just one of the excuses for not letting black people in the club. I dressed up even in a suit and they wouldn't let me in. 4/13/2016.</text>

The door tools with pick and choose who can and who can not come in as has been stated by other reviewers. Crowd is sub-par at best. Music is okay. The VIP tables are just set in between everything or off in the corners. Waste of time and money. Go Somewhere else.!!!<//review>< gmap_id>

Wish I can give 0 star because that's what this place deserves. I was there few months back with friend and having few drinks on Sunday every thing is fine. I ran in to friend of mine from work who had table service for him and his friends so as a co worker and a good friend I got them a bottle of Hennessey and gave my card to waiter with specific instruction one bottle and it was $ 300.00 that was quoted by waiter including everything. 45 minutes pass and I am like  may I please have my card back because we were leaving and answer was sure waited anther 30 minutes and girl brings check and card back to find that I was charged $ 974.26 by Alyssa so I am right away why am I getting charge this amount and her answer was that's what you ordered so I had waiter confirm with Alyssa that I order only one bottle and was $ 300.00. After arguing back and forth I ask for manager and waited for 30 min and no one came so I ask security for manager and he dispatch through his audio com and waited 45 min. but no manager so I called American Express and explained everything what happen. I did not sign my tab and left for the night comes next few days I called and called for manager but no respond so in the end this people are doing this to lots of people the same way ripping people off. I left message again today morning also but no answers or respond from manage.<//text>< pics>

<date>1412569666041<//date><Rating>1<//Rating><text>DO NOT GO TO THE MIX!! This is quite possibly the most RACIST establishment in the city (club bar or any kind of that matter) the undefined dress code is the loosely veiled diversion used to keep minorities out black and Hispanic particularly . I watched a group of several white men enter the club with large boot cut jeans and cowboy boots, before being turned away.. I a fitted sweater Ralph Lauren straight cut jeans and a pair of ferragamo dress shoes. This was apparently not compliant with the dress code as the bottoms of the pants were quote "to wide at the ankle, and shouldn't cover the back of my shoe's" WHAT!!! To add insult to injury two more white men with tattered t-shirts and baggy carpenter jeans while I am discussing this "dress code infraction" with the bouncer. When asked if the ankle of there pants being 5 times the size of mine, another bouncer who I wasn't speaking with said they paid for a table. Then when I said I can pay for a table which I had planned to do, (but obviously at that point I was no longer going to do) They responded with there sold out. Side note the guys with the large pants join the conversation and questioned why couldn't I be let in. I have friends of all ethnicities and religious backgrounds, regardless of where your ancestors are from right is right wrong is wrong.<//text>< Pictures>

Not a good way to treat customers. I hate leaving bad reviews but this was disrespectful in my book. *edit to clarify* they close the restrooms exactly at 130. Waiting for the hostess to close the bottle service tab I missed my window to use their restroom apparently.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Mix buys positive reviews on Yelp. Fact check it by calling yelp directly. Mix is junk and racist.</Text>

I love this classic diner. The outside is folksy with an awning; the  interior is old-school but very clean. As of April 2021, they've reopened their indoor dining with limited, safe-distance seating.

My 1/3 lb Cheddar cheeseburger was perfectly cooked (m), my fries hot and crispy, and the coffee (decaf for evening) was delicious.  I love that Ole's offers a choice of American, Swiss, Jack, or Cheddar instead of just the usual American cheese. My DH had a very good patty melt - although they mistakenly gave him American instead of Cheddar cheese. He didn't bother to send it back because that's hardly something to toss out a perfectly good sandwich over. Their salads have perky dark-green "leaf" lettuce, beets, and sunflower seeds.<//text>

One of the best breakfasts in the East Bay. My favorite is the pecan waffle, top it with a mound of fruit and everyone will stare with jealousy at the glorious creation. A true east bay gem will always have Portuguese sausage on the menu as well so I always have to order some Linguiça every time I go.  This is the type of place everyone can agree on, my parents love it. It’s stood the test of time since opening in 1927. When dine-in is open you can skip the line and sit at the counter which is open seating, which is my fave cause I like watching people cook. Friendly and fast service. You can also order their waffle mix from the website, it makes a great gift!< /Text>

Old school diner with traditional American fare.
Breakfast can be ordered all day.
Prices are great considering how much food is offered.

For example, I ordered the Liver and Onions. Comes with a choice of a soup or salad. Also a side of mashed potatoes or rice. And then some mixed cooked vegetables. It was a lot of food.

Didn’t have an appetite for veggies, so I only ate the liver, sautéed onions and the rice.

Felt like the onions were either over cooked or the grill needed to be cleaned. Too many of the onions tasted charred and greasy.

The liver had a similar taste. Like it had been cooked on a grill that had burnt remnants of other food.

Rice was fine.

With the above considered, I wouldn’t order the liver and onions again, but I would definitely go back to try something else on the menu.

As of April 2021, dining in is available during COVID, but seating is spaced out with social distancing in mind.

The waitresses service was okay. No complaints.

Final score, 4.2 out of 5, which equates to an 84 out of 100.

Not too shabby.<//text>

I have already reviewed this place before. The point being that I am giving this place the ultimate compliment by my occasional return visits. No review is necessary. It is a diner that serves American style comfort food in Alameda.<//Review>

This restaurant is fantastic!!!  Every time I eat here, I get that comfortable feeling I always get in a good old-fashioned diner!!!

I read a few other comments about how crowded it was on odd days, like Tuesday mornings, and it was the same for us too.  A very unusual weekday morning, and "locals" not businessmen on meetings were hanging out there!!!  Very well known and loved.

They have all the common breakfast fodder, delicious omelettes, egg and waffles, bacon, delicious and unusual Southern offerings, like grits and biscuits and gravy, and many fruit and vegetarian type offerings too.

This place was so good, I brought my mother and family here for an after graduation celebration, I think for my daughter's 5th grade graduation.  It has been packed, virtually every single time we visit.

I have yet to try any of their desserts, like pie. I think I had chocolate cake and ice-cream at least once, but I"m not a big fan of cake, so it was just so-so.  I'm sure most would enjoy it!!

Last time I was in, I saw around 6 Alameda High students sidle up to the counter top, and all were treated the same as any other customer, which I appreciated seeing.

RECOMMENDED!!!</review>

I had the waffle combination plate. 1 waffle,
1 egg  and 1 sausage. The waffle was great. The eggs were ok (no seasoning) and I didn't like the sausage at all (gave it away). The waitress was really good, nice and friendly.< /Text>

< Review>
We’ve picked up burgers or sandwiches to go a couple of times during lockdown. Always just right, efficient, and really have the show together. They went over and above tonight by sneaking in a couple of very tasty cookies.

I can’t wait to be able to sit in the booth by the window and have their absolutely delicious waffles and a cup of coffee. But until then, I’m delighted how they’re going the extra mile to show appreciation for their customers.</Review>

This is a local business - during the pandemic closures the couple who owns it continued to pay employees (out of their retirement savings) dine is is allowed and take out.

Your Alameda must have. Get the hash brown, chicken/waffle.
The french toast is a bit dense with egg, but still good.
They've survived CV thus far without having to layoff anyone, but they still need your help.< /Review>

It’s not actually on the menu here, but just ask for it if you want it. Pick any 2 pieces of chicken and they’ll cook it up to order. Super juicy and crispy, perfect with the waffle and warm maple syrup.

Been coming here on and off for the last 5 years or so. Always quick and courteous service. Food tastes great and the place gives off this mom n pop owned diner type feeling. Prices are reasonable too in my opinion since the plates are a decent size. Something I also enjoy is the fresh squeezed orange juice! They have a machine that does it but it tastes great!

Best waffle 🧇 I’ve ever had. Please do me a favor if this is your first time here please get the waffle and not pancakes. Its a waffle shop for crying out loud. Even though they are made with the same batter the waffles are just it. Trust me you will be back for more, and believe me you will never want a waffle from anywhere other than Ole’s Waffle Shop!<//Review>

I came during covid times due to a friend telling me I had to go here. I ate outside the waffles are lightly sweet and crispy, the eggs were just fluffy enough.
The waitress that day was very cheerful and checked in alot, what a sweet lady.
I ended up coming back a week or two later for a breakfast burrito with sausage in it and it was so delicious. ABSOLUTELY filled that simple craving I had.</review>

First time here today. Great food and nice service. There was a small line out front where we had to wait to be seated, but worth the wait. There’s an orange juice machine that grinds the fresh oranges, something of which I had never seen before. I had sunny side eggs, sausages, toast, and waffles. I’ll definitely be back.< /Text>

<date>1605992286106</date><Review>Ole's Waffle Shop did not disappoint us. We just spent 14 days on Alameda Island and ordered breakfast for pickup many early mornings. It  was perfectly prepared ... Eggs, pancakes, french toast, coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice as well as omelets.  We even bought 4 bags of their  pancake mix to bring back to New York. SEE you again in Feburary  and June...</Review>< Gmap_id>

We waited half an hour to get in but the wait has been well rewarded by the very good typical American breakfast. Waiters are nice. Menu is complete of everything. Price is good. I'll come back.< /Text>

I was fortunate enough to visit Ole’s with a group of friends today for a birthday celebration and despite the usual line outside we were able to be accommodated rather quickly. Our waitress immediately provided the menus and with gentleness and humor made sure each of us selected the items best suited to each person’s appetite. Each order arrived quickly, piping hot and was correct - and my companions and I thoroughly enjoyed our meals as we caught up on one another lives.<//Review>

This one diner that has been around for the longest and has passed the test of time . 'The good old days' and I hope that it will continue to be with us for as long as fate intends . I Love the food and I hope we continue to support them in these trying day. I know I should have taken pictures and intended to send to my daughter . She loves this place . But I ate the waffle and the fried chicken i ordered.
It may be small but this is a 5 +* diner/resturant. 💖< /Text>

Unfortunately, something drastic has changed here in past several years.
It was really disappointing, since it used to be quite good and worth a half hour drive.
The omelette had a layer of oil on it and everything tasted like it was from Sysco (restaurant distributor). The pecan waffle had the nuts tossed on it after cooking, as though they forgot to add them to batter first. It wouldn't have been too difficult to make it over, if that's the case. If not, wow, what lazy cooking. The OJ didn't seem fresh even though there was an industrial juicer, and it was weak. The coffee? Don't. Just don't.<//text>

<Text>I always get the waffle combo every time I go because I like having a little bit of everything for breakfast. It includes eggs, bacon or sausage (I get one of each) and their infamous waffles. I love them because they're nice and crispy and melts in your mouth.< /Text><username>Monica Ly</username><Time>1598998054010</Time></record></dataset><record>

I order the Tuna Melt it was ok because I realized at the end that you have to add the salt and pepper yourself it came with fries and they were golden brown again I realized that I needed to add the salt when I was half-way done. Errrrrrr. I was wondering why my food tasted so plane?

Moreover, my girl order the special for the day which was Meat Loaf and it came with an Amazing tasting carrot soup, Lemonade and Ice cream. Great meal, we left stuffed the service was out-standing and the scene was great. Have fun.<//Text><Rating>5<//Rating>< Pics>

Came for dinner...there was no wait and everything was delicious. I ordered the waffle and ate every last piece. My only complaint is that I wish there was more waffle on the platter.
Will definitely be back.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjG35_DxFPqyOJlRSdUwLZt8ooG__hUu9Sp5xs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMyoqh8HrnwPTxQJ-kE_1wA1tFTZVPAcMHoWtL7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< resp>

This is the epitome of a classic diner experience. Ambiance and the food is spot on. Obviously the waffles are amazing (like giant, perfectly toasted eggos), but really can't go wrong with any of it. Seating at the counter is first come first served so skip the line if you don't want a table.</text>

<text>One of Alameda's greatest culinary treasures.

10/31/20 I got a free bag of Ole's Waffe mix. Followed the directions, added a tiny bit of turbinado sugar and pumpkin spice and the results were spectacular!  I'm not very experienced with the waffle iron and I know they would have made it perfect everything, but it was a nice reminder why Ole's is the best.</text><Response>None<//Response>< date>

Great food, not the sausage gravy I expected but great biscuits and gravy.   Hashbrowns were leaning towards burnt but thick and crispy.<//Review>

<review>Stood in line for over an hour  (which I never mind doing)....only to be seated & told “we’re out of wings!!!” All I wanted was wings & my typical waffle. The waitress had no sympathy & did NOT offer to speak to the manager to @ least see if I could get the 2-pieces of chicken parts I wanted. It’s not my fault that it’s the 1st of the month, tax season PLUS a typical busy Sunday & someone did not do the proper inventory ordering or planning to serve the customers. They’ve been in the business for years, since my adult children were babies so they should know their volume AND how inventory works. It’s time to try somewhere else.</review>< Pictures>

Food was good, got the omelet. The hash brown were on the small side (maybe I was hungry) and a bit too crunchy. The biscuit tasted a little doughy. Friend's waffle came out too dry but they changed for another.<//text>

< Review>
My guy and I enjoyed a short get-a-way to the Bay area. So of course before flying out Sunday morning to Ontario we stopped by Ollie's Waffel Shop in Alameda for breakfast. What a Great place to eat while following Covid-10 precautions. The food was deLiCious. I had the Pancake combo whereby the pancakes were very soft, fluffy and melt in your mouth. The red potatoes and Hot Chocolate was an added bonus. My guy enjoyed his Omelet with hashbrowns. The customer service was excellent and attentive. Ollie's is a must visit anytime im in the Oakland area.</Review>

It’s our favorite routine stuffing pancakes at Ole’s before visiting the pinball museum in Alameda. The classical diner filled with mixed of buttery and bacon aroma offers the ultimate breakfast grubs.< /Text>

Cute place with good food. Wasn't amazing, but had excellent jams and great atmosphere. Cozy and bustling on Sunday morning, our one year old loved the little nook in the round booth where we were seated. Orange juice was fantastic. French toast was a bit eggy, and the yogurt was strange (though the toppings were good). Almost 5 stars, but not quite.< /Text>

Bring my Grands here for lunch when they visit. Friendly courteous staff. They're very accommodating. Last visit was a little chilly on the back patio and they brought ys a heater! 🤗🤗💖
The food is always good. I've taken a liking to the Vegetarian Flatbread Pizza...OMG...buttery crust, tasty sauce, fresh veggies...my new fav.
Trying to get Grands there for breakfast...but they sleep too late..lol. They're also Covid conscious. I Luv me some Ole's 💖💖🤘🤘</Text>

Well kept old time place (1950s?) with dinettes, some window tables. All the breakfast items are delicious and a good value; lower cost. Note that for $1 more get 2 slices of bacon or 2 sausage patties plus one egg. The sausage is fresh made with a bit of spice and the bacon, like everything is delicious.</Review>

Alameda classic. Great place for a quick breakfast or a slow brunch with friends. It’s always busy. Lots of counter seats in addition to normal booth and table seating.<//Review>

We adored this old diner that hops with activity.  The staff is fantastic - fast and efficient, a well-oiled professional diner machine.
The menu is large - everyone will find something they want for every meal.  The specialty is breakfast, obviously waffles are heavy on the menu and live up to the diner hype.  You will pay a little extra for fresh fruit - but I think it's a nice option.  They list the fruits available that day on a sign at the front door.
Ole's has great sweet breakfasts - I loved the French Toast especially and there were a lot of orders of it going out.  But they also have plenty of savoury food - breakfast meats, eggs.
If you are a diner fan, Ole's is definitely worth a stop!  If you're not into diners, you will still find a consistent meal.<//text>

It feels like a family restaurant as soon as you walk in, and you are immediately welcomed in. The energy is electric, with laughter and conversation in great abundance. I'm glad we found this spot, and hope we can return soon!< /text>

Great cafe to go to start your day with a delicious breakfast! Has a wonderful variety of egg/combo dishes, omelettes, French toast & waffles of course! They also serve lunch & dinner from viewing their menu (you can see menu on-line on their website). Conveniently located just minutes down the street from the Alameda Shopping Center on Park Street in Alameda! There's street parking so you may have to park near by if you don't luck out to nab a parking spot in or near the front! Worth going there & comparable to any other restaurant in price & good portion of food!</Review>

I really like this place, not only because it serves waffles, have nice toppings and have good breakfast options.
There's a local community feeling and the staff is friendly.
I like the place and enjoy visiting it for breakfast or brunch when I am in San Francisco.</review>

<Text>A+ service, speed and superior food! Grabbed a seat at the counter where we were served with a smile and top notch service. Our order was freshly prepared and in front of us in a matter of minutes. The food was excellent. I had the Denver omelet which came with hash browns. Hot, tasty and huge portion. The hash browns had a creamy texture and taste that I had never experienced before, it was amazing. The decor has a sort of 50's diner feel to it. Overall, an excellent experience, great food anx service.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

When I think of Park Street Ole's is synonymous.  Ole's is arguably one of the best places for a traditional (eggs, waffles, meat and potatoes) where it's lack in frills and fancy plating is made up by it's flavor. Our server also was no frills and free of charm but efficient.  Our food arrived quickly and to our satisfaction the waffles were fluffy and tasted like Grandma's House on a Sunday Morning and the omelettes were cooked to perfection.< /review>

<Text>Family owned, breakfast counter/diner segment.  Walk into a cozy and bustling diner.  50's music playing and 80's sports memorabilia on the walls.  Great ingredients used in their standard breakfast menu.  The hickory smoked bacon flavor comes through in the ultimate omelette.  Hash browns were properly crispy on request.  Great service.  Prices par.  Portions a little more than par.  No reservations.  Typically a line, however they turn over tables very quickly.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x808f8695ecc3bf97:0x8fd7faf4af9ea344</Gmap_id><username>Add Wheelslip</username><Rating>4< /Rating>< Time>

<text>Came here for breakfast with my extended family. There was a LONG line; I think were waited about 40 min. The portions were HUGE, the quality was good and the waitress was endearing. But it was your standard American breakfast. I wouldn't wait that long again.< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>You take a step back in time.  The employees were great and they all seemed to like one another.  I rare thing to see these days.  I sat and the bar and watched the cooks work their constant moving magic.  They were fun to watch.  My omelet was tasty, very fresh and big enough for a bigger than I should be dude.  When my wife and I are already looking forward to going again when we're in town.< /Review>< rate>

< Review>
Perhaps the best pancakes that I have ever had.  They were light and fluffy and positively soaked up the butter and syrup.

The place always seems busy, but seats open quickly.  They have tables, booths, and a counter, and done of the friendliest and most efficient service I have had in a while.

Do yourself a favor and check this place out for yourself.< /Review>

Food was great. I had the biscuits and gravy and added hot sauce and syrup to make it fun. Others had omelets and waffles and we all put the quality high. The restaurant is old and could use some cleanup, but overall this was a great place to get breakfast.</Review>

The food isn't as tasty as I remember from previous visits. Most important is the lack of restaurant upkeep. Worn carpets, don't know how they clean their tile floors. The bathrooms are not well kept up in terms of painting.  Not too sure of tile floor upkeep: black grout?? I did notice a rodent trap under a counter table heading towards the back kitchen. That is something the public does not need to see.<//text>

If you love the homey good such as waffles, pancakes and fresh OJ then this is the place. The only thing I suggest is come early. People will make line outside if they have to wait around 10 am. If there is a line is because is the food is good!<//text>

The coffee is great, they have good combo plates and really wonderful wait staff. We have never really had to wait for a spot to sit even when it’s crowded. Get in, eat and go.

My mom used to take me to this place when I was a child. This place is great with fresh orange juice squeezed by the order. The staff is very kind, patient and attentive. This is just one of the fondest memory of my late mother. May her soul rest forever Ole's is the best<//Review>

I gave her three stars because the quality of oldies is kind of falling off. At least food wise it seems like the kids have walked up fast my omelette was overcooked and dry< /Review>

<review>4 of us (all adults) ate here while on vacation during the past few days (Oct 20-24). All of our food was delicious. The fresh squeezed OJ (they have a machine up front that you could actually watch squeeze the oranges) was worth the $4.50 price tag. Also, if you like pecans the pecan waffle does not disappoint. We went for a late breakfast during the week and didn't have to wait for a table. Server gladly split our bill for us too. Would highly recommend...Thanks!<//review><Resp>{'time': 1540574288690, 'text': 'Hey Shawn & Stacy,\nThank you for your review! We are glad you enjoyed your visit to our little slice of Alameda.

<text>I LOVED this place. It was so busy, but we all took a seat at the counter, which was fast seating. The wait staff were all abustle, but each had a smile charm, witt, and hustle.

I got the French toast. It was SO GOOD! Price was excellent.

Parking was pretty easy too (went at 8a).<//text><UserId.>115414486876812597850<//UserId.><rating>5<//rating></record></dataset><record>

<review>Patty melt GREASY! Not again!
Waitress pleasant!
I've been going here since 1965 and I CAN say they still serve nice Bkf plates....waiters always great but I couldn't believe I was sitting in Ole's after lifting up half of the Patty Melt..The bread was drenched so maybe the cook was in a hurry to go home, I don't know!
Stick to the Bkf + dinner menu...< /review>< pictures>

I hate the cold, right out of fridge half and half. Hot coffee (as I love), becomes immediately 10+degrees cooler once cold creamer is added. They DO have powdered creamer...but, its behind the counter and you have to ask!! 😉😉👍🏾<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x808f8695ecc3bf97:0x8fd7faf4af9ea344< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

My go to place for amazing breakfast when in Alameda. It's got such a nice vibe and ambiance  to the place. My service has been pretty good for the most part, even when crowded on a weekend morning. If it's your first time here, you must try the fresh squeeze orange juice!< /Review>

I can see why Ole’s is a local institution.  The food, service, and atmosphere are exceedingly memorable.  The bacon here is excellent quality, just what you hope for out of a breakfast joint.  The fresh OJ is another high spot!< /Text>

Always a treat to be here at Ole's. Has the best OJ anywhere in the world and the best breakfast in the bay. Always love coming there for anything and especially when I come in on drill weekends (Coast Guard). They treat everyone great and the main/head waitress Marbella is the best (sorry if I misspelled your name).< /Text>

I just love this place - old school, cozy, & great food.  I know the title has waffle in it, but I always get the pancakes, which are super yummy.  The atmosphere is wonderful too, lots of regulars enjoying their breakfasts or lunches.  Servers are really nice, too.  I'll be back the next time I want breakfast in Alameda.</review>

This place used to be great years ago. Early, early a.m. still good, old school crew. Don't even bother with lunch or dinner hours unless you want rude service, burnt food and food poisoning.</Review>

The food was a little pricy, but the portions make up for it. It was pretty busy, so the service was a little slow...but if you're not in a rush like I wasn't then it's not too bad. The French Toast was pretty basic, but had really good flavor. The sausage patty was  surprisingly large and juicier than expected. They also got my eggs JUST right. Overall, not a place to go crazy over...but definitely a great place for a cozy, hearty meal.< /review>

Great place for parties of 4 or less.  Additional seating in the back for larger parties but feels seclusion.   Delicious food HOWEVER if you get the waffle and dont like it dark and crunchy, you gotta tell'em when you order.<//Review>

I had the "waffle with blueberries". The waffle was good -- not huge, but adequate in size, and tasty. The blueberries turned out to be a compote, which was fine but not the fresh blueberries that I had anticipated. The wait staff were fast and attentive, and although there was a waiting list with folks lined up out the door, they made it a point to not rush us to get out.< /Review>

Friendly and high quality customer service. I had coffee and pancakes. I could have sipped the coffee all day but the pancakes were not great. It could have been a one-off thing, but while they were the right level of moist and fluffy, they fell apart at the slightest movement, making it pretty difficult to get from the plate to my mouth. And once syrup was involved, forget it - half the pancake stayed on the plate in a crumbly, syrupy mixture. I'll probably give it another chance just in case it was a fluke, because the rest of the dining experience was exactly what you want in a diner.< /Text>

I went here with my grandma who grew up in Alameda. She said it isn't as good as it used to be. I ordered the burger and fries and it was ok. We split a waffle that was also decent. There are better places to go for sure in Alameda. There aren't that many seats either, so be prepared to wait for average food.< /text>

I absolutely love these guys. Anybody who says that they have a bad experience is lying to you. That being said, to get accurate results, you repeat experiments. Try this place. Then try it again. Then again. Rinse and repeat.</Review>

The waffles were thin, crispy & delightful.

Also the diner itself is neat to look around, it looks vintage - it even may be original interior decor.</review></record>

Best slice of chocolate cake I've ever had and I'm old and...well fed.
Nice folks and a great burger.
"No worries"says the waitress
The wife says they are packed for waffle breakfast.
I'll be back.</Text>

I give 4 stars only because a 5 star restaurant is upscale. As far as the food is concerned, it's five stars, in my opinion. It's cooked in front of you, it tastes great, it's cooked, the way you like it, the first time. I'm very critical about the food that I consider "good", because I can cook myself. I have had no issues, at all, here. If you want a good meal, served fairly quickly, this is your place. Their service is friendly, and accommodating, and I love the fact that I see a little off all races eating here. That's always a sign of good food being served. This is my 2nd time here, and I'll definitely be back.< /review>

<review>food and service here was great! After doing a search on  Check Please! (A bay area food talk show),  my partner found tnis place he remembered from 6 years ago. We. Entered the restaurant and immediately were greeted and seated. Our request to move to a booth was honored immediately and water, menu, and smiles were at the table before we could sit down good, the waitress was kind, polite and extremely patient despite my indecisiveness as a first-timer. Our food was excellent!! Pancakes light, fluffy melting in my mouth. The selection of meats was impressive.  The turkey bacon was by far the best I have ever had. I could go on but by now you should get the picture and make your way to Ole's in Alameda. High energy atmosphere with lots of hugs and love.  They were in sync like the perfect Tango!  You will need to be creative with the menu as some entrees are not paired together well (ie, breakfast combos or waffle dishes)< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

If you've spent anytime on the East Coast the concept of a diner isn't something you need to explain. Here on the West Coast it's more along the lines of a Coffee Shop. Ole's Waffle Shop is both. It's a place that serves breakfast, and an amazing breakfast at that, all day. Everything on the breakfast menu is wonderful, from the hash browns to the waffles. But the also serve classic diner fare as well, open turkey face sandwiches, french fries, fried chicken along with homemade soup and chili. The best way to describe the place is it's everything Denny's wants to be, just a whole lot better.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Great old school diner with a bustling vibe. I tried their waffles with linguica and their french toast and loved them both. I don't think you can go wrong here, and I recommend stopping by if you're in the area.<//Review>

TRULY DISAPPOINTED. Not at all what I expected. The reviews made this place seem it was well worth the wait. After waiting 30 minutes outside in the sun we finally have to sit ourselves. My husband and I ordered the eggs Benedict and two waffles (blueberry and chocolate). What they brought to the table was truly disappointing. The eggs Benedict was poorly done the Benedict sauce tasted like melted butter that goes on movie theater popcorn. The waffles were thin and covered in this blueberry syrup that coated the entire waffle. The bill was outrageous as well costing a total of 55 dollars! For drinks and two meals. This is the first time I have written a very poor  review, but I hope no one goes through our same experience.</review>

< review>
We lived in Alameda for almost 25 yrs and used to take our inlaws to Ole's and Tillie's. Tillie's is long gone, but Ole's is still going strong--and is better now than it ever was. Delicious, high grade thick-slice bacon, crispy and wonderful, old fashion waffle iron waffles. And for an extra $2.50 you can buy an individual bottle of pure maple syrup if you like and refuse the high fructose phony stuff. The service is comfy, kind, and friendly as an old pair of favorite tennis shoes. The menu offers special omelettes every day it seems. But we go to Ole's for the waffles! Recommended.</review>

Great local breakfast joint. Sometimes it can be a bit of a wait for a table, but it's always worth it. There's usually seats open at the counter if you don't want to wait for a table.< /review>

<text>Food was underwhelming , waffle cold (butter would not melt much), hashbrowns were undercooked and greasy. Orange juice and bacon was ok. Pure customer service, I stood at door for approximately 6 mins. I seated myself at counter where I waited another 5 mins and was completely ignored until someone else sat at the counter. They took the other person's order first. I was patient because it was my Nephews BD and he wanted to celebrate there like he did when he was a kid. He now lives out of state and I live am hour away. Save your money, he also had waffles, bacon and apple juice for $44.00.< /text><gmapID>0x808f8695ecc3bf97:0x8fd7faf4af9ea344<//gmapID><pics>None< /pics><Time>1562027256552</Time><name>K Anderson</name>< Resp>

< Review>
Went to a waffle shop and ordered french toast; did I break any rules?  Their french toast was seriously delicious and the syrup they provide is a good pairing.  I was able to try some of their biscuits and gravy too, not too bad, but not too impressive either.  I did not get the pleasure to try a waffle, however everyone in our group said they were amazing.  And if they are as good as the french toast, then I 100% will order the waffles next time.
Only docking 1 star because we were sat in the back section.  You had to walk through the kitchen to get to the table.  It was loud and smelled like cleaning solution mixed with whatever food they were making.</Review>

<Review>This used to be my parents favorite breakfast place, but after our last visit we crossed out from our favorite list of restaurants. I took my mom for mother's day and worse experience ever. My mom order a new York steak and the meat was spoiled. The hashbrown was over cooked. My eggs tasted like oiled powder eggs. And my bread order was wrong. My omelette was salty and no taste at all. The entire food quality was terrible. There was a young white spanish manager who careless of our complaints and did nothing to bring the negative experience to a positive experience. Her lack of customers satisfaction tells you all. Honestly not worth the price.<//Review>< Date>

Scrambled eggs were still runny, side order of ham was slightly under cooked, French toast could've used a little more heat from the stove/oven.

Waffles were excellent though and so was the service. Could tell the waitress was having a bad day though.

I might come back.< /review>< rate>

Excellent breadkast and ridiculously fast service. This is a classic dinner straight out of the 1950's. Go in for breakfast or brunch and you won't be disappointed. However, be aware that it can get pretty busy and you may have to wait in line during the more popular times (Saturday at breakfast, etc.).</text>

I've eaten at Ole's twice now : both times the service has been excellent with very friendly outgoing staff/servers. Most importantly , this is a WAFFLE shop , and the waffles are terrific. The fresh orange juice is squeezed right before your eyes in a wonderful old juicer / dispenser...1940's or 50's vintage...so cool and delicious....Lots of waffle places are popular nowadays and Belgians "are all the craze" but Ole's are the best, crisp and light , just the way I like em!</Review>

Ole's Waffle Shop has been around a long time, and there's a reason why. This is my favorite breakfast place in Alameda. They have many great things on the menu, and it's all delicious, but as their namesake would suggest, the waffles are wonderful. That is my favorite breakfast item here. They also serve many other kinds of food though and are open all day. I've eaten here for dinner and it's just as good. You feel like you're having a nice meal at home.<//Text>

Great atmosphere and service at this cute traditional diner. I'd take out of town visitors here just for the experience. Dropped in around 3ish for a snack so there were plenty of available tables. About $18 for waffles and a side of 4 link sausages and a cup of coffee. The waffles were freshly made, light and crispy - we loved them but don't expect to feel full. It's a little pricey just for waffles but for a park street location it's to be expected. The moving minuture carousels and Christmas  fairground scenes in the window were a nice touch as well.</Text>

Since I moved to teleworking one day a week and my wife moved to a later start time we've been getting breakfast here once a week.  The waffles are good but it's the staff that really makes Ole's special.  Amazing service from warm and friendly people.</Text>

I ordered one waffle as a side (unknowingly it cost $7) to my main order of linguica, eggs, hashbrowns and coffee. At the end my check was for $25, and this was for ONE person..... The food was ordinary, like going to Denny's. The waffle is thin and floppy, not worth $7.00.<//text>

< review>
Germ-a-phobes, and hypochondriacs beware. This place puts forth a five star effort but their cleanliness leaves much to be desired. While there I watched the chef cough on his arm, and handle raw meat with his bare hands without washing before handling other food items. Crums and dirt that accumulated on the prep counter was haphazardly flung to the floor as well as into the food that was stacked on top of each other waiting to be served. The toast I ordered with my meal was soaked with drippings from the food that had been stacked on top of it as it sat waiting to be served to me. The food was no frills as advertised and served in hearty portions (this is a good thing). Although extremely busy, the staff remained pleasant to the customers. I witnessed a server settle a monetary dispute with a customer by paying the difference out of her own pocket! Even after the customer left, the server continued to affirm that she did not mind doing it. BUT... at times, (more than what I deem acceptable) the staff could be heard using inappropriate language in their personal discussions that occurred in front of the customers. Picture a classier Waffle House.< /review>

The pancakes are grainy, hash brown was burned, and coffee lacks flavor. Ham steak is still good and eggs are cooked ok.</Review>

Great food! Waffles are so delicious you don't need syrup. Be warned if you order ala carte items the price will sky rocket quickly.
Instead take your time and find a combination that encompasses your desired appetite.< /Text>

<text>EXCELLENT!
Ole's cooks are out of this world.  First the staff is great and so helpful and accommodating.  Had them cater our annual halloween brunch with chicken, waffles(they did let me know that the waffles don't travel well, but no one even notice, they disappeared quick:-)), pancakes, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage and hashbrowns!!!!! Everything great!!!!
Everyone was very pleased, very full and ready for a nap after!
So Great Job! Please keep up the good work!  I'll be seeing them again real soon!!!</text>< pictures>

Garbage service.
Waitress gave up our check way too early.
Food did not taste half decent, sausage was not fully cooked and tasted nasty.
Asked waitress for condiments and walked away as soon as I finished my request.

Overall, not impressed and upset with the restaurant’s service and quality. Never coming back.<//review>

<text>Bad experience.
Someone at table spilled water, took forever to get a towel to dry my lap, they wanted to wipe table before letting me dry lap.
When they were done, I realized they threw away my dinner and coffee, despite it only being table and my lap wet.
They really didn't want to help me out with a towel to dry my lap.
Probably not ever going back.< /text>< Pictures>

We wouldn't go out of our way to go here but we would definitely go again if we were in town.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Disgusting, the food was cold and the pancakes were a horrible consistency. The bacon was very burnt. It took to long to bring the food and none of the employees smiled nor to mention the cooks where very loud and we could not talk. I would not go again</text>

<Text>The food was as expected for a waffle shop... Awesome pancakes, ok everything else. Not the best ribeye, I wouldn't order it again. Sat at the counter, who ever the waitress was SUCKED!!!! I asked for things crispy, she brought them soft. Never once asked how we where doing and I had to ask for our check 3 times before she pulled it out of her pocket to hand it to us. I would have understood if she was extremely busy.... but she was not!!!! Stay away from the waitress that looks like a clown...<//Text><Name>Melissa Dillon</Name></record></dataset><record>

You can get diner food here, but you'd be a fool not to try that you waffles and pancakes. You can even get real maple syrup. A working definition of Heaven? Pretty close.< /review>

Arrived on Saturday morning and there was quite a line at the door, but it goes by quickly.

I ordered the waffle combo with 1 scrambled egg and upgraded to chicken apple sausage (got chicken garlic instead). Bf ordered potato pancake special with sausage and eggs, and also ordered a side of hash browns.

Tried a sip of the fresh squeezed orange juice. Eh, it's ok. I wish it was served cold. But again, I'm biased when it comes to good oj (Florida girl here ;))

Food was decent. Nothing bad, but nothing spectacular. The waffle was good! But I found the rest to be standard. Hash browns had no flavor though.

Service is quick, so I can see how they turn tables so fast.

Worth giving it a try, but I don't think it's be my first option to go to for breakfast in Alameda.< /text>

Ribeye steak was good, we ordered one and split it.  There was enough protein 9 oz to share for two even three.  A single serving of protein is 3 to 3.5 oz.</Text>

<Text>I really liked this place for having a no BS attitude and being a classic American diner. From my experience don't expect the wait staff to have much time for you to explain all your food allergies. Basically, think Ron Swanson.

We went on a Sunday at 12:30ish pm. We waited outside for about 15 minutes and were seated at a 2 top. We got coffee and a fresh squeezed oj. The coffee is weak--probably Farm Bros or something, but the oj was so dang good. I got the pecan waffle with eggs, the husband got the Spanish omelet with hash browns and a biscuit. They were both super tasty. We were stuffed afterwards and agreed we'll be making Ole's a normal stop for hangover afternoons.<//Text>< pics>

I first went here when I was a child in the early 90's. The waffles were always to die for. They are still just as good today. I always go when I visit the area.< /review>

I just moved to the East Bay, and have been really excited to try some new restaurants. But it seems like everytime I go to Alameda to eat, I'm kind of left disappointed. The day after I moved to Oakland, I looked for a breakfast spot to eat at with some friends. Decided to go with this place, and realized that was a bad move. The place gets surprisingly packed. Is it for good reason? No.  I shared a lot of dishes with my friends, only to find out that the food is just okay. Seating is not worthy of being filled up the way it does. It seems like a local spot. But I've had a lot of great local breakfast spots from different places, and this place is so mediocre. And you would think that their waffles would at least stand out? But they don't. Will definitely not be coming back here. Oh and the waiters and waitresses seem so unhappy. It's not like an unhappy and untasty place.</Text>

<Review>I heard about Ole's from Huell Hauser on his show "California's Gold". It wasn't as big in real life as I thought it would be. Its reputation seemed quite large. Nevertheless the packed dining room and the line of people waiting outside were served quickly with great food. There was no rush either. Ole's is a very well run place.

I'll be back for more.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x808f8695ecc3bf97:0x8fd7faf4af9ea344</GmapID></record>

< Review>
Honestly, of all the fantastic place in the East Bay to have breakfast, Ole's must be among the worst that I've eaten at.  Food is marginal at best, lines on weekend are very long (this always is laughable), and for the same money, there are four or five breakfast nooks within three or four blocks that blow this place out of the water.<//Review>

Worst food ever!!! I went there after hearing how good the food is for three years and I got the chicken fried steak...I've microwaved better. First of all it wasn't even fried, there was no outer breading and it tasted like a cheap hamburger. The gravy was horible and the server never stopped by to ask if my meal was ok or fill my drink! The place wasn't even busy! I will never make the mistake of going there EVER again. If you want good food jims is about a block away.< /text>

Greasy spoon.  Food is just ok.  Been here a few times.  The last time i thought the place was a bit shabby.  Clean the carpets at least.  Had a weird smell, u ended up not eating there.  Service is ok.  Food is just ok.  its a bust spot too...  so i know they can pay to spruce it up. A bit.<//review>

<text>(Translated by Google) Despite being a place where we understand that they also work on quantity, we have found availability and good food. Great for breakfast, the Pancakes as well as the French toast, they brought an exquisite jam but syrups were already available in 3 different flavors to put on the Pancakes. Great eggs and bacon. Very friendly staff.

Pur essendo un posto dove si capisce che lavorano anche sulla quantità, abbiamo trovato disponibilità e cibo buono. Ottimo per le colazioni, buonissimi i Pancakes così come il French toast, hanno portato una marmellata squisita ma erano già disponibili degli sciroppi in 3 gusti diversi da mettere sui Pancakes. Uova e bacon ottimi.

(Translated by Google) This place is always very busy, so you should go with the idea that you are going to wait approx. half an hour for your table, if you are lucky it will be a little earlier, but the best part is that the wait is worth it, the waffles are delicious-crispy and thin and the fresh orange juice 100% recommended, also there are a couple of gentlemen who help you all the time- (not the waitresses). I mean the gentlemen who clear the tables.

(Original)
Este lugar siempre esta muy ocupado, osea que debes ir con la idea de que vas a esperar  aprox. media hora para tu mesa, si tienes suerte sera un poco antes, pero la mejor parte es que la espera vale la pena, los waffles son deliciosos-crujientes y delgados y el jugo de naranja fresca 100% recomendable, ademas hay un par de senores que te ayudan todo el tiempo-(no las meseras) .me refiero a los senores que recogen las mesas.< /Review>

{'time': 1539290148800, 'text': 'Hello Brendan,\nThank you for your review of our restaurant we appreciate all feedback. However; we do take exception to you reverting back to grade school name calling of our employees over the internet. That "crusty old bag" as you referred to her as is someone\'s, daughter, mother, and sister. Was your experience so bad you felt the need to ruin her day.  You absolutely could have asked for a manager or owner to explain your situation to, and give them an opportunity to try and remedy it. Also please proof read before you post a review as "week" is actually spelled weak. Enjoy homeskillet from now on and have a great day.'}< /response>
