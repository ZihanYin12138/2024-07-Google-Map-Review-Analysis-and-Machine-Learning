UPDATE:
I just had the freezer i rented out picked up today and it was fast and an easy process. i called a week ago to schedule my pick up and they gave me an available date and it was scheduled right away. Jesse, the man who picked it up, was informative ans straight to the point -- thank you. He came between the time they said they would arrive. i love how everything was done fast and electronically. i would definitely rent out again from them.

----------------------

It was such a breeze renting out from American Appliances. Elvira helped me a lot - she gave me detailed information about the contract of renting out. She was also polite and patient with my questions. I loved how reliable, fast and easy it was for my request to be granted. The company uses DocuSign for the contract which I love.

They just delivered today and I am very happy with their service. I will definitely order from American Appliance again.

Thank you so much!< /Review>

Affordable service. I rented a washer and dryer for 6 months. I paid $240 with installation waved and delivery and set up plus attachments included. I am renting so this service and price is ideal as it beats going to the wash house. I would definitely recommend this business.< /text>

Signing up, payment, and install were all super easy. Never had the guys out for anything. Pickup was super easy as well and you dont even have to be there (as long as someone is). I lived in an apartment and needed one. The complex used this site and they do a great job! Would definitely recommend if you are looking to rent any appliance!<//review>

My home freezer failed and repair cannot come out for 3 weeks.  I  rented a freezer so I wouldn't loose food and have to worry about this for 3 or more weeks.  I am happy with my decision.  Very professional service.< /text>

These guys make things so easy.  Great customer service!   Called in and they explained everything and made it simple.  Then placed the order online.  There website is great!   Roger came and installed the fridge the next day.   He was amazing!   He explained so many things to me and gave me so many tips on how to fix my old broken fridge!  Keep it up Roger!< /Text>

American Appliance Rentals provided amazing customer service when taking my order for a fridge.  The rep on the phone was kind, patient and thorough, explaining the process well.
I could track my delivery online and the delivery guy came as scheduled and was amazing!  He measured the entry, was super careful and did a great job. The appliance was clean and just what we needed.
Will not hesitate to use this business in the future. Customer service is worth the 5 Stars review.<//Text>

<text>Great company to work with. Options for online and personal services really good. Will accommodate your schedule, although they give you a big window but texted 15 minutes out! Loved that. Took pics how they find it and that helps! Pay for everything up front so it won't be a back end charge for that 30 notice they want! I highly recommend. My fridge was out since April! Can't say the same for Sears/Kmart? Who are they now?<//text></record>

Thank goodness this company exists! They are so fast and professional. Jesse came and took care of our installation and he was so cool! You can tell that he is a pro. I looked at the washer and dryer after and was really happy with the quality for what the monthly rate is. Cheaper than going to the laundry mat, and you get free installation if you pay six months in advance. Highly recommend for renters.<//text>

<Review>Never knew that there was a need for fridge rental, until I needed one! What am I going to do?  I didn’t plan for this and can’t afford a new fridge right now ;(.  What there is a solution?  Wait a minute what’s this flyer?  Really, fridge rental? No way not me, I getting my own!  Two days before the move.....nadda ;(. Damn it!

Then I remember the brochure, let’s take a look....ok not bad, I can do this for 6 months then get my own. So, I called them, last minute but they still managed to get a fridge over to me one day after my move in.

Customer service over the phone, excellent!  They explained everything to me and just when I was going to ask a question, they answered it.

Delivery Guys, awesome! Two months after my move in I had to change apartments.  For a small fee they came and moved it for me, snap! Just like that.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Admittedly I was uncomfortable with the amount of personal (credit card info, ID etc) they request and keep on file.   That said the installation was timely, and the gentleman who installed my fridge was personable and efficient.   I wish every delivery/installation was that pleasant of an experience.<//Text>

<Text>Great service! The automated system sent updates via text and I was able to confirm the delivery time by text. The installer came at an earlier time in the delivery window which was great and he was very nice. As an addition: I had to order a replacement and they were abel to get it to me the very next day. Excellent service and nice, professional installers (Roger and Calvin).<//Text>< Pics>

Great experience renting with them for 1.5 years. Decided it was time I bought my own fridge, but never had an issue with their fridge or company. The installers were super nice too. I had Ramon pick up my unit when I was done and he was very kind and professional.</text>

<Text>Speedy service! My washing machine broke, needed replacement. Had new washer the next day!
Excellent communication about delivery time.
My technician was extremely polite, kind and freindly. Removed old machine and installed new machine quickly. Very easy no hassle rental service.< /Text>< pics>

The BEST company to rent appliances from in LA. Ramon was professional and had the patience of a Saint, while installing my frigerator in a "not so easy" space in my apartment. I now rent 2 refrigerators from American Appliance Rentals😁</Text>

The process was very smooth and easy, just ended up with the handles on the wrong side than expected would have been great if I could change it. It was a Life saver in the end .< /text>

I'm usually suspicious of any type of rental company. There are always hidden fees and customer service is mediocre at best. American Appliance Rental shattered my stereotype. I was pleasantly surprised with this company's service. Everything was throughly explained, their customer service was exceptional. The communication was crystal clear. Overall a super easy experience. Bigger companies can learn a thing or two from American Appliance rental. My girlfriend is 7 months pregnant with our first child. We needed a fridge asap and American Appliance was there for us. I recommend this company wholeheartedly

<text>My refrigerator died while I was out of town.  American Appliance Rentals handled my situation promptly and professionally.  Raymond was scheduled to arrive between 12:30 and 3:30.  I have to leave for work at 3:00pm so I asked if he could make it a little early.  He came at 11:00 and was gone by 11:30.  He was friendly and efficient.  I could not have asked for more.</text><Name>Donald Brumit< /Name>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I rarely write reviews but I want to share that my installer, Ramon, provided EXCELLENT customer service. Ramon was very professional, knowledgable and friendly. He replaced my stackable unit answered all of my questions.  I was considering looking for another appliance company but after the great service from Ramon,  I am a happy customer again. Ramon is truly a great asset to American Appliance.< /Review>< pics>

<review>Excellent customer service. They responded very fast to my application during the weekend, and when they couldn't reach me, they emailed, left voicemail, and even texted. So that was very convenient. Their website is very simple but very reliable.
Delivery schedule was on point with EATs.
The service person doing the installation was GREAT. Very friendly, patient and professional. Our cable guy was also installing some cables and he was able to work around him and our mess from our Moving. Very talented bringing the appliances up the stairs.
We loved the service and pricing. I'm very pleased.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80dcdc5ffcbb118f:0xe0af8319d1c059b7<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Overall, the staff had a great attitude and was easy to deal with. Negotiating did not get me too far with management, but I still paid a fair price for my Kenmore French Door fridge.

The delivery guy had the most difficult task as he had to make my fridge fit through my apartment complex’s narrow stair case. Luckily, he came up with an ingenious way to do it and was done within half hour. Big Kudos to Roger, the delivery guy, he was confident he could make it work and he did.

Thank you American Appliance, my wife loves her new fridge! Happy wife, happy life :)<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<gmapID>0x80dcdc5ffcbb118f:0xe0af8319d1c059b7<//gmapID><text>Stay away fro this company! I rented a stackable washer/dryer which the technician had to take back the same day, because it was not working.  How do you let a product leave your warehouse without ensuring that it is in working condition?  The unit is very old, and when I asked the if they had a newer model I was told that was the only unit they had.  They supposedly repaired it, but after washing a few loads my clothes look like they were washed 100 times, several items were so badly damaged I wore the to paint my cabinets.  A couple weeks later I called back to see if they can replace it and again was told its all they have, so I asked to cancel my service, and was told they require a 30 day notice to cancel service.  You mean, I have a product that doesn't work, but you are going to charge me anyways?  Companies like this should be ashamed of themselves. Number one, it's criminal to charge someone for a product that cannot be used.  Number two, you don't have more than one unit?< /text>< Pics>

< Review>
If I could give them MINUS stars, I would. Horrific experience all the way around. The unit looked like it fell off a truck, leaks and smelled like a dead body when it was finally delivered. After 2:15 of their inept driver bashing the stairwell up while I begged him to please stop, I finally began video taping the hundreds of dollars in damage he caused. Didn't sway him one bit - he just wreaked more havoc. To add insult to injury, I was specifically told by Vanessa S., Customer Care Manager, to NOT pay the first monthly bill until we got a copy of the bill to repair the damages American Appliance Rentals caused. It took three weeks for the repairs to be made, and then I had to wait for the monthly billing cycle by my HOA. I submitted the bill the day I received it, but not before being called, texted and emailed threats to damage my credit if I didn't pay the monthly bill. I tried to pay it, and they refused! The icing on my cake? The staff rudely refused to provide me with the owner's name and contact info so I could share my concerns with them.  RUN AWAY AS FAST AS YOU CAN - American Appliance Rentals inventory looks like junk yard leftovers, smells worse and they have zero concept of what decent customer service looks like.</Review>

I rented a dryer from this place and is the worse customer service experience I have ever experienced. I have no complains about the dryer or the installers, that was great. This company really needs to evaluate the peple in customer service. First they don't send you a reminder or bill not even for the first month of service. They charged me a late fee  and when I called and talked to a lady in customer service on July 22,2018, I explained to her that I was comfused because to my understanding I paid two month in advance when I first rented the dryer and I also told her that I didn't think it was fair that they were charging me a late fee when no one explained me anything and she care less about what I was telling her she was very rude on top of that. I also shedule pick up that same day because I wasn't happy with all this issues, to my surprise when I asked her to cancel my service she told me that I still needed to pay an additional month even if they pick it up that same day that I was calling. She told me that the customer is suppose to call 30 days before to schedule pick up. No one told me anything about this neither so I ended paying an additional month. I hope this can help other customers.< /Text>

I would not recommend this place for anyone. The customer service sucks. They don't show up when they say they are. The fridge they brought to ny house had bugs. The guy who picked it up scratched my wall because he was too lazy to take off the doors. I asked to speak to the manager and still no response.< /Text>

I hope my review saves you money!!
My experience was awful with this company, first of all, the fridge was messed up and when I tried to change it, they gave me hard time, charged me and at the end they didn't change it.
Second, this company just takes you money and no service or good product in return, they over charged me, every time I called to speak to someone, I was on hold for at least 45 min and when I asked to talk to manager, she was busy, they told me that the manager would call me, 20 days later, still no call, I called back to see what happen to manager they put me on hold for 30 min and came back saying there is no manager available right now
This company is a joke
Save your money and just buy a fridge, believe me you save more money that way

I can't believe this company is doing business with this kind of awful and horrible customer service</Text>

the fridge i got smelled like rotten food and the paint on it is flaky.  there's also a crack between the door and fridge, i'm not sure if it's a problem yet but it's definitely not supposed to be there.  they price matched a competitor but i learned later that a 6 month contract comes with 1 free month so i'm actually paying more than what they normally offer.  they never mentioned this deal before and they said it's too late to change.  i don't like companies that try to nickel and dime you.  i will be changing vendors as soon as the contract is up.< /text>

I definitely recommend Optum Urgent Care!!  Everyone that I came in contact with was very organized and nice.  Super plus for being clean in every part of the office that I saw.  Dr. Helen  was very nice.  Dr. Shadpour answered all of my questions he was very informative and super nice!  Dr. Nguyen was also nice,  we even had a laugh or two.  I could tell that all 3 doctors love what they do,  I was not rushed out in any way. Customer Service from check in to check out was great.</review>

The is the first time I have been here since the urgent care changes management from healthcare partners to optum.
While the wait was actually very quick, the physicians assistant, PA, did not seem to have a grasp of the pain I have been  in, or some of the other co- existing issues I have. Without having confirmed from a MD that I did not have a break in my ribs or knee, she told me that I was in good shape with a sprain.
Experience has taught me that sprains are more painful than breaks.....but both are debilitating as far as I am concerned.
I felt she offered sub-“optum” care.

While this facility is very close to my house, for the future, I feel like I will be in better hands at the Exercise Urgent Care on Del Mar Blvd, where I have been treated by actual physicians many times, and feel that I am in much better hands.<//review>

Grateful for DeMar who assisted with getting my Mother, an Optum HealthNet patient tested for Covid. He went out of his way to take care of her immediately and deliver results within 20 mimutes. Thank you for showing care and concern, we appreciate you. God Bless, please take care.< /text>

Got turned away for a covid test on a Saturday because I didn't have an order from the DR.  So there advice is to return on Monday with an order from the Dr. Thats a whole 48 hours to wait for a test after I told them I had close contact exposure to someone positive. So much for having insurance.</review>

I brought my daughter this morning for the first time. Overall, I was very pleased with the level of urgency and care all of their staff exercised to provide her care. Even though they had patients ahead us, we still went in rather quickly and I'm very appreciative of their service and the treatment they rendered. I've been to other urgent care and this one is definitely the best one yet. Thank you.

Addendum of my original review:

I have changed my rating from 5 stars to 3.

Reason:  I just received a collections notice for an unpaid bill which I never knew about.  Never received any bill from you guys to even have the chance to pay for it. I'm calling you guys tomorrow and this better not have an adverse effect on my credit history for an unpaid balance for which I was unaware.<//Text>

I went to Pasadena Urgent Care because I believed I had a broken hand. After waiting for a long, long time, I was finally taken to an exam room, where I waited again for a long time. I heard people talking in the hallway, and kept hoping my doctor would come, but at 6:00 pm it sounded like people from the hall were leaving, and all the lights went out. I felt my way around the room to find a light switch and was able to get out. I was so freaked out that I didn't even try to find anyone running the front desk to tell what had happened. I thought this was a place to go at night after usual doctors' offices were closed.< /text>

I liked the doctor. She didn't spend much time with me but was kind and efficient. The main issue I had was with the nurse. She was super mean. I asked if I should put my arm down when she went to take  my blood pessure and instead of answering directly she said sarcastically, "you've had your blood pressure taken before, right?"  Guess what, nurse, it's your job to give people basic directions on how to do these things. She said other rude things too, like when I couldn't remember the start date of my last period. She was dripping with disdain. I hope she quits nursing as clearly she has zero empathy and anyone who picks on sick people is a bully.<//text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

Worst experience ever. I know this is an urgent care, but it just seemed there was all this staff doing nothing. Arrived at 6:30am on a Saturday as I had something in my eye. 3 people in the waiting room. Waited 1.5 to called back to a room to see MD/NP/PA. Put in one room and left there for 15minutes but told the doctor will be right in. The. Moved to the “eye room” where I was told someone would be right in to do an eye exam. Again 15 minutes later nothing. Walked out to ask questions. 2 MA’s sitting at the desk, had zero clue what was going on or even what room I was in. I am in medicine myself and I know things take time. But what is the flow of this urgent care? Where is communication of actual timing is being seen. Right away, 10, minutes 30minutes. Tell me what to expect. Why do you say you are 24hrs when it doesn’t even seem a doctor was there for the first 1.5 hours. Why do you have all this staff sitting around and no one being see. Likelihood to recommend on a scale 1-10 I would give it a zero.<//Review>

<text>Have been here for myself, my husband, and my daughter over the past few years.  Have always experienced excellent care and attention from the doctors and nurses on the staff here.  Am amazed at the breadth of their knowledge in having to deal with a huge variety of health issues.  And parking is free (rare in Pasadena).  The only problem with this facility is the wait time--almost always 1-2 hours (worse during flu season).< /text>< date>

My name is Miguel. I’m from out of town and went in for asthma issues at 2am and they tended to me right away. Not much of a wait time. Very courteous staff and doctor. Thank you for your time and professionalism. Two treatments after and I was feeling a lot better. Thank you.< /Text>

<text>I went last night due to spider bites cause of the field of work I do. It says they accept medical or Medicare which is a lie because I presented my card and the person said we do not except it. I was treated is if I came off the streets and worst of all the person insulated his coworker in front of me. To top it off both doctor and person made it seem like I could not afford anything.

No one really cares, $124 dollars to get very bad medical service what a joke. I've been to small offices in East Los Angeles area that are 50 plus dollars with greater service and have people who care and treat everyone equal.<//text><user_id>102877100162458301092<//user_id></record>

The nurse staff is great in listening and providing care but I have a complaint about a doctor who seemed to be nonchalant about my care. Telling me that I was wrong in dosing my antihistamine when I was only following previous doctors orders. He continued to downplay my situation without even considering what I was saying. I told him I had hives and he told me I was wrong and that I had a rash not hives. He kept telling me I was wrong and that I looked like I had questions. Of course I had questions because everything I was instructed to do was wrong by his perspective. I felt not only rushed but unheard. Dr. Joseph, I believe his last name started with a S. was unprofessional and I felt like I just wanted to leave and pick up my prescription.<//Review>

Nice, great clean facility. The front desk staff are amazing and very helpful when checking in. The wait wasn’t that long, but do go early in the morning if you can. The doctor(female) was kind, compassionate and very understanding of my need to not be prescribed antibiotics with out proper testing first. Definitely will be coming back here!

There was no thought into this, and she didn’t even tell me how to clean it until I asked her specifically.

I went to this clinic in the evening of Oct 21, 2017.  I had serious electrical burns on two fingers.  The care was excellent.  The staff was friendly and  professional, and the care was very thorough.  You have to wait, but that is the case in every competent emergency care facility.   I highly recommend this office.  I am not even a HealthCare Partners client.  I belong to another group but their center was full and not accepting patients.</text>

It is worth to wait after all the clinics are closed, they have good doctors. It has waiting time because of convenience and less expensive compare to regular emergency hospital. If you need urgent between life and death then go to regular emergency hospital is a must.< /Review>

Staff are kind. Doctors are very attentive; they listen well and genuinely try to help. I hear the waits can be long, but my experiences in the waiting room have been very brief. The distance I drive is worth the quality care my family and I have received.<//Text>

Went here at 11:30 PM for a severely swollen tonsil affecting my breathing. Helen (the nurse practitioner), Dr. Shadpour (sp?), and the RN and desk clerk were all very nice. I'm used to waiting up to 3 hours to be seen in our local urgent care, so I wasn't expecting it to be so efficient.  I was seen within 20 minutes, received a steroid injection & observed for 30. We were out & on our way by 1:30 AM.  I was impressed and thankful for the kind care during off hours!</Text>

The staff was super patient with me and waited between vomiting to check me in and take my vitals. The doctor saw me promptly and didn't just tell me what I needed and leave. He also returned to check on me as I was getting an IV drip. The nurse who attended to me was super sweet and helpful, she even took extra care to gently remove the tape from the IV. If the need ever arises again, this will be my go-to location.</Text>< Name>

< Review>
Waiting is inevitable. Obviously patients are seen based on need. Little ones and elderly get seen sooner. It is good to have the option of this facility when your PCP is unavailable after hours and on weekends. We have always been treated well, even if we are there for 3 hours.</Review>

The majority of the staff providing service tonight deserves no stars (except for Tony, he was a gem)!!!  I waited over two and a half hours in the waiting room, which caused me more joint pain from the draft created by the door opening and closing.  Wish I would've been able to wait in my car.  To make matters worse when they finally took me to the  examination room, they left me there undressed and waiting for a "6 minute" lab result for over twenty minutes!!!  Who does this?!!!  I had already told them my pain had increased from the wait, yet no one had the common courtesy to follow-up with me as time transpired.  What made matters worse was that when I finally got dressed and walked out there were FIVE employees sitting at the station, one of them the one who said it would be "6 minutes!"  When I questioned her, she said my results were negative!  Wow!!!  But she didn't have the common courtesy to go in and tell me this?!!!  Where did customer service go?!!!  Have they taken on more than they can chew? Kaiser is beginning to sound like a much better choice!!!  Not to mention that it would be less expensive!  After over 20 years of being a patient with HCP...I'm ready to go elsewhere!  Obviously, I don't recommend them!</review>

My teenage son had a very bad ear infection and our pediatrician's office was closed so we had to go to urgent care. He was trying not to show it, but he was in such excruciating pain, several other patients at the clinic went to the desk at various times to insist that he be seen by a doctor before them. The front desk staff was utterly unconcerned, and made him wait in spite of the other people in the waiting room repeatedly insisting that he should be seen first. Once he was finally in the examining room, he felt un-selfconscious enough to finally cry out loud and wince in pain. This from a kid who has suffered several serious sports injuries without a single tear, so I KNEW he was in severe pain. The staff heard his crying from outside of the room and freaked out: "there's a violent patient!!!!" Seriously? A sixteen year old kid curled up in a ball, crying in pain? When he was finally seen by a doctor, she had the worst bedside manner I've ever come across. I tried to explain his medical history with ear infections (punctured ear drum and multiple surgeries) but she seemed disinterested. The staff here are all highly unprofessional and lack compassion. Even the people in the waiting room were horrified at the way my son was treated. Avoid this place if you can.</Review>

Friendly staff! The front desk person, Helen (Practitioner) and security were amazing and I was helped in a timely manner. Had a horrible experience at the Healthcare Partners Urgent Care in Los Angeles, which is why I ended up at this location. I shared my experience with the front desk person and she was very sympathetic and apologetic for the treatment received at the Los Angeles location, which is something the Los Angeles staff did not do.< /Text>

Verry curt personnel.
Three wait was easily four hours. Then they call you in and state that the doctor will be on shortly.  That "shortly" was thirty minutes later.  Why would the staff call you in of the doctor is not ready to see you?! My thought is they do not want to miss charging you or the insurance company for your visit should you decide to leave. These people did not care for me,  they wanted to charge the doctor's visit!
Wasted the entire day here.</text>

<review>I've had great and terrible experiences at this Urgent Care facility.  Today was the worst. Support staff is great, the doctor seeing patients today is awful.  I will be changing my coverage to Keiser after this experience, even if it's a little farther from home. I am glad that open enrollment on medical plans is coming up next month.< /review>< Rating>

<Review>terrible experience. i told the doctor (george samaan) i have been having yellow diarrhea for about 6 weeks. he gave me no medication at all and no diagnosis. told me to take it easy, eat starchy foods, and see my general doctor. i left the place knowing i wasted my time and money.

turns out i had campylobacter bacteria in my system and now i have to take antibiotics. i strongly suggest avoiding this place or the very least the doctor who attended me.</Review>< GmapID>

I've been there 3 times and the last time was very urgent. Dr Yee treated me as if I was in a regular hospital. Staff is kind, prompt as possible, patient and thorough. Dr Yee wants a recheck but was so worried about me she still called me on her next shift to check on me. So thoughtful.< /Review>

As someone with a chronic illness who always has to ask the question "ER or urgent care?" Or knows "i just need an IV but the ER costs so much ugh" this ER actually gives me my about monthly saline IV And has actually made efforts to learn about my uncommon illness as they've had others come in with symptoms of it. Of course it depends which doctor you get but at least compared to other urgent cares I've been to they deserve the thumbs up.

Also people who complain of long waits: in ERs And urgent cares patients are taken in and prioritized by their ability to wait. If you're coming in for a physical or some medicine for a cold or a shot you're going to be waiting for quite a while, especially if someone like me comes in with heart problems who CAN'T wait. Be happy you have to deal with a problem that can wait.<//text>

DO NOT come to this place, go to your regular doctor or ER SOMEWHERE ELSE!! This place should be ashamed for hiring doctors that are PATHETIC!

Sharis Saketkhoo, MD is wonderful. Brilliant, proactive, personable, competent, her exceptional bedside manner matches in excellence to the level of care she brings. She is exceptional and efficient! She's just a great and experienced doctor! Couldn't have been more grateful God put her in our lives today to help care for my dad. The staff was efficient with time and took urgent matters urgently! Appreciate their teamwork and level of care! The RN's, TECHs, and DR. Saketkhoo were wonderful. Thank you! You are all appreciated!<//review>

< Review>
Was here for over three hours. They took four viles of my blood and managed to lose some of them or mess them up they wouldn't really admit to which one it was but didn't contact me until three days later to let me know that I'd have to come back in to get more blood drawn. Absolutely so unprofessional. Yet they still want to charge me for testing despite the inconvenience. Should have waived the fee for the inconvenience. Likewise the doctor was nice and informative but the nurses need more organization to combat issues like this.< /Review>

It started great walked right in, not busy at all. They put me in a exam room quickly but than I found myself waiting at least 30 mins until the doctor came in. There are a lot of nurse/ nurses assistance around and no one checks up on you. As a employee that works at a major ER in the area it makes uneasy to see that this is the Standard. Also  after the doctor assessed me I found out that I was gonna wait another 45 minutes before, I had to go out and find help because no one checks up on you I feel like that's a sad example of healthcare for the urgent care.< /Review>

They diagnosed my husband's  appendectomy, my sinus infection (after a wrong diagnosis in the ER) and most recently after one urgent care completely dismissed me treated correctly. The treating physician even called me at home one week later to make sure I was fine and that I had followed up with my primary doctor.  I was in shock to have a physician call me at home to check up on me! They also try to avoid ER wait times and got my husband straight into surgery without waiting! I can't say enough about this place!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
This is the worst urgent care!!! Do not go here. I waitedd 3 hours to get to room and waited another 45 to be told an xray was needed which I already knew from triage nurse,  then I get told machine is down so they use another one so it will be awhile since its a shared machine. When I expressed my frustratiin the dr said sorry but you know the ER would have been longer, are u kidding me. No staff in this place updates you on wait time or whats happening. This place is a joke.< /Review>

<name>Susan E</name><Review>Generally going to an Urgent care is just so irritating, frustrating etc. But today was not that bad. After seeing the news of how many people have been going to Urgent care, emergency room and drs. Offices I was not looking forward to an entire day there. But my daughter and I checked in at 8:15, called back by 8:30. Vitals taken she was given tylenol and orange juice. Put in a room by 2 very nice nurses waited for strep results. Dr. Came in said no strep the flu, perscribed tamiflu, note for school and out the door by 9:05.
Just really wanted to post a good review.<//Review><response>None</response><Pictures>None</Pictures><GmapID>0x80c2c37ba04f6069:0x8d901e26969a2cb8<//GmapID><Date>1515403924352< /Date>< user>

I brought my husband to urgent care on fairoaks to check his eye out.  Was sent here by our eye dr.
The lady at the front ( Lupe) told my husband the reason why 2 people went ahead of him was that they had a more serious problem. Wth
We had been waiting for 1 hour.
So your telling me that his eye is not serious. Someone needs to train her (Lupe) on how to answer questions for urgent care patients.

Called to ask if they take United Health Care.  It went something like this.
Her (sounding annoyed): "Is it an HMO or PPO?"
Me: "It's a PPO."
Her: "As long as it's not through Obamacare you should be fine."
Me (thinking): "What Health Care Professional refers to the ACA as Obamacare?"
Me: "What? I'm confused.  I'm trying to find out if you are in the UHC network."
Her: "You'll have to call your insurance to find out."
Me (unbelieving): You don't know if you're in an insurance provider's network or not? Seriously?"
Her (rudely patronizing): "No, I don't know that. You'll have to call your insurance..."
Me (laughing): "Okay, thank you I'll go find someone competent."</review>

<text>Excellent service. I peaked in just to look at phone cases and all staff was so friendly and personable. Very easy to chat with and if I didn’t already have service with a free extra line with sprint, I would’ve switched to Verizon. Thank you east Ave Verizon staff. You guys are cool! 😁✌️</text>< pics>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>My experience with Daniel the sales rep at Verizon was awesome. He's polite. Very helpful. He made me and others with me feel very comfortable and just the whole experience awesome. I left my old phone with him for hours while waiting for my new one to be ready and he asked everytime for my permission to open up certain apps in order to help me with my issues on phone. He didn't try to hustle me into some big sale .he helped me get what was  in my budget.  Best product for what I wanted and overall I'd have him help me anytime. Very nice man. Good spirit to him. Thanks Daniel for all your help.< /text>< pictures>

Once again, Victra did an outstanding job of getting me set up. Jonathan was superb.

My only regret was beyond their control. They were unable to access a corporate account, so I still have some work to do to access my lost phone.</text>

He was friendly and overall a kind person to deal with.  He gave everything to us straight without any excuses.  Daniel gave us comparisons and the different price ranges, that was the difference that didn’t change our minds of getting new phones< /Text>

Just go to a real store not this knock off store where no one is held to their word.  Probably going to another provider  if verizon can't fix their incompetence. Management is a joke here!

Went to Verizon today, the one by the Pour House and I have to say that I was nothing but amazed with the gentleman who helped me, Jahai. He went above and beyond my expectations. We have a business account with Verizon for the past few years and nothing can even come close to Jahai’s customer service skills and generosity. He genuine cares about his customers and helping them understand things. If I could give them ten stars ⭐️ I would. Jonathan helped too. What a little gentleman and Mackenzie was sweet too!

Hector was wonderful.  He did everything he could to speed up the process.  Verizon tech help was ridiculously slow.  It took 2.5 hours to make the transfer from old phone to new.<//Review>

My visit to this outlet was efficient and cheerful. Staff was helpful and seemed to identify our concerns before we had to mention them. The store was in stock with the on sale item we stopped in for, and staff explained in simple terms how we could get our best value with both our device and our account. The amount I'll be saving is nearly the amount I spent! This place and the people here are a real value, both for me and for Verizon. Thanks Victra!! You Guys Rock!< /Text>

<rate>1<//rate><review>Picked up a phone from an online order on Monday, went to set up the phone at home (I hadn't received my Otterbox, best not to carry it without one) and found out the sim card was no good.  Went in today and asked for a new sim card, and explained the issue.  The rep. wanted to take the sim card from old phone and put it in my new one.  I explained that I wanted a new sim card to go with my new phone.  He didn't seem to like my answer and told me that sim cards "don't get old".  I had an issue with my PIN, so he put a call into Verizon (?) and then went on to help someone else.  In the meantime, two elderly gentlemen were being helped by this rep. who sneezed, un-stifled and and uncovered in front of all of us and then proceeded to sniffle and wipe his nose with his hand.  It was disgusting!  He was also very rude to the two men.  Because my rep. was helping someone else, I asked the other rep. if I could simply get a new sim card from them and be on my way.  He explained why he couldn't (did not make sense) and proceeded to tell me that I should have come into the store to buy the phone and not online.  Again, rude!  So as I am waiting for one the reps to help me, I observe two of the reps with their masks off or not completely covering their faces, which was my queue to walk out of there.  I have never seen such lousy customer service in my life and I certainly did not feel safe.< /review>< pics>

She messed up my husbands account, I never want to return to this authorized retailer I rather wait until corporate opens because of the bad experience Mickayla gave us. On top of her not really knowing how to do her job she is extremely flirtatious which is unprofessional when you’re at work. I saw it with just about every male customer. My husband and I get assisted and of course the gal doesn’t leave my husband out of her flirtatious circle. Super unprofessional and you bet if I could rate it a 0 star I definitely would. Everyone else in the store was super helpful and sweet in a non flirtatious way like Mickayla assists customers. Been in that store multiple times been assisted by the other gal Briana also a few of the gentlemen and they’ve been nothing but amazing but I just so happen to come in and see this newer gal and I already could tell it wouldn’t be a good experience with her body language. Just terrible experience over all because of that gal.</review>< pics>

<rating>5</rating><Review>My fiancé and I were going to merge phone plans and we were trying to decide on Verizon or AT&T. (He's had AT&T for years and I've had Verizon for years.) We went to this store first, because it was the only one open during Phase 2 after the COVID-19 outbreak.

It's kind of funny, because we were bickering over who was better and I kept telling him how great Verizon was, but when we went in there the person working was surprisingly rude / not helpful. Obviously, we left and went to AT&T. Well, they got the award in the rude / not helpful department! Ultimately, we went back to Verizon.

There was someone named Bri working this time and we had a totally different experience. I am not going to name the other person, because I understand that people are stressed out right now with everything that's going on in the world, so that person gets a free pass this time around. However, Bri deserves some recognition!

This person is a candidate for a promotion, or at the very least a raise! Excellent customer service! (Able to work in a fast pace environment, under pressure, and multi-tasking efficiency, all while remaining calm, cool and collected - knowledgeable and informative - professional and personable)

Overall, my two points are:

1. I think we need to take into consideration that things are not normal right now and we need to be a more patient as customers during these trying times. The employees at this store are clearly following all the regulations (keeping stuff clean, wearing masks, having folks stay 6ft apart, etc) and I presume they're doing their best.

2. I think,  and my fiancé agrees, that Bri has really proven herself to be a valuable asset at this place of business (from what we observed a couple weeks ago) and we hope that she gets recognition for that.< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>Jahai, along with everyone else at this store are top notch!  Switching from AT&T was pretty brutal but they made it a smooth and very rewarding transition. I would highly recommend going to this store if you’re thinking about switching from STUPID AT&T  or any other subpar phone company! Verizon is the best!<//text>< rating>

Agree w a previous review on this thread; something shady about this store to say the least. I've been a Verizon customer for over 6 years and have never encountered such horrible customer service. You upgrade your phone and expect to pick up the same day, yet you call the store and they provide no help but do say "We will call you when we get Verizon's email and again, we will get to your order when we get to it" than you Express you're dissatisfied w their customer service and they respond w a "Yeah okay, uh huhh". Sadly I couldn't cancel my order per Verizon customer service BUT a huge lesson learned !<//text>

We walked in this store as they were closing on Father’s Day at 6:00 PM. Hector and Andrew welcomed us and wanted to solve our problem with one of our phones. They told us about the amazing BOGO; we got such a great deal!!!! A free phone and a huge discount on iPad! Wow, their service was the best, so smart and kind, gracious and helpful! What an awesome crew at Verizon on East Ave! We are so grateful!<//Review>

<Text>Just called to talk about my phone because I had bought it less than 3 months ago. It was an iphone 5C. The black part was popping out of the pink part. Based upon a conversation with a local computer guy, its because of the glue on the phone. I called the verizon office to see what was going on and how they could help me. She asked if I had insurance, I had mentioned that I don't. She said well we can't fix it then because that doesnt just happen. I'm like actually it does. She goes well then call our warranty department, then hung up. I can not believe how RUDE she was. WOW< /Text><Date>1401733891567< /Date><gmapID>0x808327bf3ab68d05:0x2828367b8abdf5b0< /gmapID>< user>

They messed up, cost me a lot of money, BUT did credit me $50 of the $100 I wasted.  At least they tried.  Not sure I would go back.  Something kind of shady about this store.< /Review>

<text>Cool new place in east village right across from Albertsons. The place is huge, the right side for the bar, dog friendly and the left side for the restaurant sit down, need to be seated and not dog friendly. The bar is right when you walk in. Grab some tasters, some tasty IPAs. Cool vibe, a little empty but it was pretty new.< /text>< pictures>

Great new brewery in the East Village! The menu has tasty items such as the karaag chicken sandwich. The beer was good as well. I am excited to have this spot across the street!<//text>

<Text>I just love Melvin Brewing.  The Wu-Tang Clan theme, the Asian menu, the old Shaw Brothers movies they usually have playing on the screens, the well crafted beers on tap all make this one of my favorite hangouts!<//Text>< pics>

<review>On Sunday September 15 we visited Melvin Brewing Co. We had a great time. I never would've thought I would drink at a brewery playing awesome Kung Fu movies ⛩️🎋🥋.They have a few games to keep the guest entertain they also have Street Fight arcade machine AWESOME.If you're looking for live entertainment they have a DJ with great mixes 🎶. The atmosphere at this Brewery is lay back and ready to create great memories with you and your friends.

For our reviews we tasted the following Beers;
🍺Digital Clouds Hazy IPA,
🍺Golden Mazapán 1904,
🍺Xozo Chile Stout,
🍺West Cost Melvin IPA
You can check our Review on YouTube The Beer Ambassadors

What we loved the most about Melvin is the collaboration with 3 of our favorite places
BORDER X BREWING, POR VIDA, & BESHOCK RAMEN 😋🍺☕🍜😋

Guys come check out Melvin Brewing at East Village you'll love it<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzdglvY24EqUZL4CTGgpOqcj0hX3sOVF4wslSr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-fXpbg7vuI8mBiDREnHCK_30KFjthVuY4uaHe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKt0rBPfFEW-FkGrHD5_m9pTDwY6ttgXb4h-wQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPcZff3X9ziHSB2JSSbwykELUwSkpxFQoaYq2Kf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeGGlmqMIR1qrlM5ts5-FPqIOWooVVFFMVxgtP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwGxaqC67ZNDJk3g-HswpgBZoyN9UT0CIK5q-m=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFLFssB_YBkq39iGzSaxL5Kc0Q3TNcaWCfpwa1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnNeZOwTsq8boAP-1CG5k52iuMMosQYvQVa_IT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< response>

I had the Blonde; it was my speed since I'm pretty simple as far as beer goes. My sister had the sour and really liked it. We also sampled a few of the IPAs. The food was really good Asian fusion cuisine. Solid brewery.

As I write this I am under the influence of not good food, poor service and a couple three beers that were actually very good.

Apparently you can bring your dog inside and mingle and eat with people.

Trying to think of why I would come back but drawing a blank.

Bartender told one guy who came in that they were no longer serving at 9:13 but was more than happy to serve her friends at 9:25.  Hmm..</Review>

<Text>Great aesthetic and awesome brews; Not your typical destination brewery. Beers are mostly IPAs and the food is sort of a gastropub/Asian fusion. Not my favorite combination, but there's something out there for everyone. They also play nothing but king-fu movies on their many TVs so I would not recommend this place to a person wanting to watch sports with friends and have some drinks. Dogs are allowed, but only in a certain part of their restaurant. Thanks for keeping San Diego interesting!<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<user>114899747266473860084</user><Review>We had an opportunity to check out Melvin’s newest spot in San Diego this weekend and we’re happy we did! Great venue… it was easy to locate and parking was available too. Not bad considering we’re not from San Diego!!

As soon as we walked in and quit gawking at how cool the place looked, we were greeted by a friendly maître d’ who set us up with a table. She was great! Probably couldn’t have been more friendly and welcoming… she made us feel like we’d been there before and were being welcomed back. Thanks for the awesome service, Steph.

We tried the 2x4, which was excellent. Also gave the Cloudy 5000 a whirl, and a collab DIPA they did with brewery out of Nevada. I *think* it was called Mel-O-Vision. Regardless, you better get in there before it’s all gone because it was TASTY!! Hubert rounded our thirst. So. Good.

We also gave the pork gyoza (perfect, slightly crispy and hot), kobe corndogs, sprouts (mmm, savory!), sticky wings (I think it was a whole chicken. Huge pieces!), and yellow curry a try. We inhaled all of them and there were still items on the menu we didn’t get to that looked incredible. Neat mix of Asian-inspired step-up-from bar food.

The wall murals and particularly, a whole bunch of nun-chucks hanging from the ceiling were pretty eye-appealing. Great music and old school kung-fu movies on the tv’s. Our San Clemente friends will be back soon, and I’m jealous.</Review><response>None<//response>< time>

A downtown micro brewery.

I'm not a drinker so I can't weigh in on the beer but the food is pretty good.

Basil fried rice is awesome (add that egg!)

The flat breads are decent single thin crust pizzas. Perfect for one or even split for 2. (Dynamite Seoul)

The handcut fries are amazing and we always get extra ketchup like white trash redneck stereotypes because it's that good.

A typical order from us is:

Tatoyaki, Handcut Fries extra ketchup, Thai me up add egg and one of the three flat breads.

They've been open for a couple months now and we make an effort to eat there once a paycheck because it's fast delicious food. For what you pay, you get it. We get take out and it takes 15 minutes.

They also play 90's oldschool hip hop like wutang and nwa while appreciating old school martial art films that inspired the RZA and Method and the ODB.

I'd like to see them open for lunches eventually. They'll probably do real well this summer (2019)<//review>

I went to get some work done on my wheels, I thought they quoted 20 bucks and I said ok. At the end I guess I heard wrong and they said it was $120. Of course I was shocked kuz I thought it was 20 bucks but they thought I wasn't trying to pay and they lifted my car and took off my wheels so I wouldn't drive off. It was very disrespectful, especially since I always go there to get anything done with my wheels. Just bad customer service.<//text>

<Review>This was a very good shop nice friendly staff also they had some good used 20inch tires that I needed for the front of my vehicle. Very reasonable price for the 2 tires I would definitely recommend this shop.< /Review>< Pictures>

Love this place my boss recommended Lorenzo’s Tire shop, and they treated me very well and the prices on tires are amazing I have a Mercedes-Benz with two different size tires one size in the back and one size in the front, they made sure to get the right tires for my car.<//text>

Fastest but most expensive. I've never been in and out of a tire shop this fast and I've never spent this much on a used tire of this poor quality. I don't know if I'll cone back if I have time no if I'm in a hurry yes. I probably should've went elsewhere and where I've gotten better used tires for $20 cheaper :-(<//Review>

< Review>
This park has a special place in my heart and my families.   First of all its home to the famous Cherry Festival with amazing concerts all included in you $7 admission. $5 for seniors.

My family has had memorial picnics and several birthday parties here.  It's an amazing place with staff with hearts of gold.  💗💗💗</Review>

Inexpensive, clean, best lifeguards who actually pay attention and know the kids, and fantastic swimming lessons where they engage each child and work through their challenges, fears, or swimming weaknesses. Even better, kids taking swimming lessons can get in for FREE during open swim from 12-5pm the afternoon of their lessons to practice their new skills, how awesome is that?!?  Highly recommend this place!!!!< /Review>

<text>I like this community pool I like taking my kids here during summer the water is always clean so are the bathrooms my reason for 4 stars and not 5 is the lifeguards they act more like cops and they choose who to tell rules to and not others and sometimes it's like they are just making stuff up</text><user_id>103848102758357772493</user_id></record>

So probably not the parks fault but we came to see Smash mouth. The show said from 8-11. It started after 8 and we are now on the highway at 9:17 because the show is already over. Sound was good and the performance was good just nowhere near as long as advertised. 😔</Text>

<text>Great place to visit or live. Shopping areas were plenty and acomadating.  Lots of fun at the Cherry festival, great entertainment, fantastic food, games,  and rides, friendly people. I felt safe there  with my family because you could tell everything  was secured for the communities protection.the weather has been great too. All in all, my family and I had a very blessed and  fun weekend here in Bomount, .ca. See you  next year,  here at the 101 Bomount Cherry Festival.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< user_id>

< review>
I wanted to express how much I love living at the Summit! The staff here has really gone above and beyond during the pandemic to still make sure that we are taken care of.  I moved in about three months ago and I could not be happier with my home.  Kami helped me find the perfect location and floorplan to fit all of my needs and checked off all of the boxes I was looking for. There are a lot of newer buildings in the area, but none of the staff at those buildings made me feel more welcome than her.  I also have had great service from Sonia, Carol, and Joysmeri in Resident Services.  They are always happy to assist whenever I have had a work order.  It really feels like the whole staff cares about the residents.  The maintenance techs always smile and wave as I walk around the community.  They even try to make holidays special by offering treats to the residents, and they just started having Food Trucks come weekly which has been a great way to meet neighbors.  I’m glad I chose the Summit over all of the other places I was looking at.  It really feels like a home, and my family and I couldn’t be happier!<//review>

Save your sanity. Creepy place. When you're out, they will come in without letting you know. Leave a camera in your room.  They don't clean up black fungus growth after so many job requests.I started allergies and headache from breathing inside.</Text>

<review>Toured and leased the same day! Such a beautiful and peaceful community. So close, walking distance, to everything, The Village, Topanga Mall, Amazon Fresh etc...Love having a garage attached to our home especially with kids. Love all the amenities and greens around. The apartment we saw was clean and washer and dryers in the unit!!! Staff is super friendly and helpful as well. We were helped by Kami McNerney the leasing manager,  she was so knowledgeable, patient with all questions and needs.  The property manager Monique Clark also helped teaming up with Kami to make the leasing process simple and easy. All pluses for us and we can not wait to move in!<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<text>What a facade of a place. This place is a joke. Security is a joke. Spend $100 a month so you can park on the street just to NOT have parking at night because they let in WHOEVER to park at night. Literally did not have parking. If you want a head ache this is the place for you! I have lived pretty much everywhere in LA and this is the biggest joke of a community. Attempted break ins, people come in at all nights to party OUTSIDE the units, Drunk Drivings. You name it, its here. Only positive is Monique, She's good at her job and listens to all the complaints.</text>< Pictures>

This place doesn’t care about people that rent from them. They tow vehicles during a pandemic without caring. Once these lease is done I’m out this horrible place. You guys aren’t just so unprofessional but have no respect for people’s lives or wellbeing even during a pandemic and even tho you actually had people that paid you! Lots of landlords didn’t have that luxury. DO NOT RENT FROM THIS PLACE< /Text>

<review>I have lived at Summit apartments for awhile and was very unhappy with the management but Since the new property manager Ms Monique Clark has taken over I have seen huge changes.
Ms. Monique Clark is very professional, courteous with an awesome personality. She spends time on daily bases going around the property, observe the surroundings and conditions, I am sure there will be huge changes at summit apartments in the near future by Ms. Monique Clark and her new leasing office staff.
I shouldn’t leave out the Residents Services department Carol and Ricardo are also very professional and courteous.

I couldn't agree more regarding the troll in resident "care" office....malvin is the most useless individual there, don't waste your time asking him for anything, he thinks this place belongs to his mother.... well- wake up!
you're just a desk worker from the lowest kind, with some power rush, we've seen dozens like you before and will see dozens like you in the future. we will be sure to contact your managers to tell them about you, you can rest assure in that</Review>

Resident services sucks. If you want anything done you have to call the leasing office. We have tried for three weeks to give our 30 day notice. No one responded to emails. No one called us back despite leaving numerous messages. While living there, no one enforced the parking rules so there was never parking near our unit and security was rarely able to come and settle noise complaints or tow cars that were parked in front of garages. The units are beautiful but the management makes this place a pain in the butt to live at.</text>

I am happy to write this review because of the pleasant service I received from the leasing manager Troy McCarthy. He is a class act, professional, helpful, and responsive. Under the new management the place looks awesome and well run and I am a excited to call this place home for the months to come.
I had an excellent experience, as Troy made it so smooth and easy to find the right Townhome, and to go through the paperwork.
I definitely recommend this place,

< Review>
The sevice in this place is terrible. They show you their best face until you accept living here. After that, you have to jump through hoops to get the paperwork finalized. My husband had to do the paperwork that was entirely up to them. When we started living in the apartment, it had a million defects. According to them, we did not give them time to finish the apartment ... but is it not supposed that the apartment they already have is completely ready? Otherwise, they would not have offered it to you. Anyway, we have already gone to a resident services and it's already going for a few weeks and they can't fix anything. I’’m hoping to move out soon. “Lipstick in a Gorrilla”</Review>

We have lived at the Summit for 6 years and are about to sign a new lease for another year and we are so happy to do it! The Summit, I've been noticing has done quite a lot recently to help make living here a joy. From new lighting around the complex, fresh new colors on the buildings, and more of a security presence. We love our home and we send our thanks to everyone that is part of the Summit team for everything they have done and continue to do!!< /Review>

I wish I could recommend The Summit to live but I can’t. The customer service is the worst. They NEVER answer the phone and don’t respond to emails. How can you service your customers like this? You have to go to the office to get help! Good luck if you work within the office hours. I have had monthly plumbing issues, my patio is causing damage to the garage of my neighbor, along with other things that are falling apart that I constantly have to complain about. Just recently, I questioned if someone had entered my unit for repairs while I was away. I noticed a light/fan that I rarely use, was on. Of  course no one is responding! I can’t count how many times I have contacted GHP Management to complain about the service. I caution you to move to this place if you don’t have any patience to deal with these people.< /Text>

<rate>1<//rate><review>Absolutely terrible. We have sent numerous complaints about ant problems and no one ever takes care of it, now ants are going into my baby formula which is not only expensive but dangerous to my nine-month-old child. The first day we moved in the people that set up our apartment did not connect the hose of the washing machine to the drain instead it was left out and water leaked all over my kitchen causing me to use brand new towels to mop it up which I was never reimbursed for. From the time we moved in until now which unfortunately when we have to renew her lease it has been nothing but trouble. Our next-door neighbors hammer all hours of the night waking my son. I have to leave my air conditioning fan on 24 hours a day just to drown out the noise of the next-door neighbor. And that is expensive to my DWP bill. I absolutely hate this place!</review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<Text>Never choose this Apartment. Management is very rude and careless when welcoming new residents. Any complaints on the house reported will not be take care immediately and they will drag the issue for longer period and after several escalation they will solve the problem. They also work closely with the Towing company and through their security guards, they keep close eyes on Residents who park temporarily outside their garage and immediately call the towing company to tow the vehicle. This is not a expected behavior from the Management or Security guards. I have even witnessed a car towed in 5 min after it is being parked. The towing company pays commission to the security people and they will monitor and take our vehicle immediately. Cars are being towed even if it is not parked in the red zone or yellow zone. And the management encourages it. Security guards takes photos and send the vehicle photo to towing company and the towing company uses that time to charge more money rather than actual storage time at the towing facility.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

I'm outraged, as a perspective tenant with the services I received to date. In fact, complaints written against this corporation is characteristic of their unprofessional business practices and ethics. The complaints that I have read about regarding the reviews of the Summit Warner, sadly  affirms the poor customer service I experienced and I haven't even signed a contract.  I left numerous messages, both verbally and written in which all have gone unanswered.  At this point,  my plan is to request a refund of the deposit I paid or that they are holding. It is also my plan to contact the Corporate Office on Monday to express my dissatisfaction of the lack of  professionalism, courtesy  and questionable practices I have experienced thus far with this company.  Also, I am prepared to seek financial redress in small claims court, if necessary.  In addition, to filing a complaint with the BBB.</text>

Moved into Summit a few months ago and I have been very happy. Staff has been on it and communicated with me every time I had an issue with my apartment. I have lived in places where you pay 8k in rent a month and things still go wrong. As log as when they go wrong I can call someone and get it taken care of that is what matters.

I highly recommend Summit, it is gated, set up for privacy, and great space in my home.

Ladies in the office have been amazing!</review>

Be careful!  They are crooks. When you move out after you clean everything they will come to see it and you'll sign your move out checklist. After you sign the checklist the guy will say I need to have my manager sign it or make copy-some BS like that. Once he's in the other room he'll checkmark extra costs to add up to their move out cost so they can get more out of your deposits. Real crooks! The security is just for the show, just consider there is no security. It's a dangerous and smelly place to live. If your window is close to the trash can you are doomed. Don't get fooled by their showroom!</Review>

They rent to rich adults who move their teenage children in and never live there themselves. If I had a dime for every time I've been woken up in the middle of the night because two people were trying to fight in the parking lot, I would be able to buy the whole complex.

Our neighbors below were doing some sort of airbnb for homeless people. As soon as one car packed with trash drove away, another one would pull up in minutes. I'm not exaggerating.

Before we moved out, they hadn't thrown the trash out in weeks. Teenagers knocked them over in the middle of the night causing a HUGE disruption. If you see cracks on the trash cans, that's why.

Then there are all the people who park wherever they want. It wouldn't be so bad except that we didn't have a garage for our unit because management used it. So there I am, struggling to find parking between the transient people, the ghetto people blocking garages, the rich people who don't like to park in their garage and the morons who use their garage for storage. And the U-hauls. Don't forget those. You'll be seeing a lot of them because all of the decent neighbors around me MOVED out.

One drive by from security should solve this but security never comes. Speaking of security, tell your friends to just drive on through. No one checks. No one cares. And apparently, simply walking up to the gate is enough to get security to just open it. This means that all sorts of transient people just WALK in without showing any kind of proof of residence.

My car was broken into while parked in the loop on Summit Vue Lane. Again, no security, no nothing.

Oh and don't forget the awesome management. You can't get in touch with them. They don't want to help you with anything. I'm not even sure anyone actually works there. Turnover is insane and no one picks up the phone.

When we first moved in we got a security camera indoors. Somehow on the first day we installed it my wife caught a guy walking through our place. After hours of no one knowing who the guy was, apparently it was an electrician from a random company management hired to check out the apartment next door. He came to check our unit for safety. They gave him a key. Didn't notify us AND couldn't identify him. We told them he had blue shoes and that's how they finally figured it out. How many other days has this happened I wonder? And to how many other people?

Don't. Move. In.

We thought we were moving up to a nicer place. If I could do it all again I would totally stay in our 1 br apartment and just save up money to buy a house.

We lasted one year here.<//text>< pics>

It's not perfect but it's not as bad as other seem to make it.

It's a beautiful community, everyone is very friendly, and I have never had an issue with getting something fixed in my unit.

The price is high but for the area, it's actually pretty competitive considering the washer/drier in every unit and attached 2 car garage. I couldn't find anything in the safety of the West Valley that offers a Townhouse style living situation for a better price.

It's walking distance from movie theaters, malls and restaurants as well.

We have been there for a year while we shop for a house and so far we've been very happy.

EDIT: Dropping a star because of the huge price increase. We were paying $100 per month more every year but this year it almost went up $300 per month. WAY too expensive for what you get and the poor maintenance and customer service.

Also, there has been an influx of crime in the area. Mostly from outside of the complex but it still seems to effect the overall community.</Text>

<Text>Resident service is completely useless, I have complained about the AC issue in our unit for the past one year but they just don’t want to fix it, since the central air conditioner/heater  does not push the air to the second floor, when the AC is onn our first floor is 65 degrees but the second floor is 90 degrees due to which we had to add portable ac units in both room, the resident service clearly does not want to fix the issue so we did our own investigation and came with an answer in less  then 10 minutes of inspecting, the pipe leading to the second floor from the ac unit is only 6 inches in diameter which is not enough to even cool a small bathroom. Yet every time so called “professional technicians” from summit come to my unit to check out they always go back saying it’s working fine like they just don’t care about the residents.
Just because they have nice landscaping  doesnt mean this complex is worth living, there is a reason this place is rate 2.5 stars, also forgot to mention during rain roofs leak.
Right after I wrote this review Monique I believe she’s is the property manager reached out to me Saying they will talk to HVAC and get back to me it’s been over a month they didn’t get back, as resident we are taking a massive utility bill hit because of Summit’s poor infrastructure and they don’t want to fix or compensate for the high utility bill due to the portable A/Cs since the central until  provided by summit does not work the way the should be. Desperately waiting for our lease to end we’ve had it enough of horrible horrible summit management.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This is NOT a place you want to live.  For the price we pay here you would think this was the most beautiful well maintained complex out there.  WRONG!  We had a problem with roaches less than two weeks after we moved in, and we are completely clean and OCD.  This has to mean they didn’t have the place properly inspected before we moved in.  Not to mention the models homes look worlds better than the actual unit you move in to.  It is false advertising and they should be put out of business for it.  When we were applying we were told we would have one unit then got pressured into taking a more expensive unit due to the one we were promised not being ready.  This was total manipulation because they knew we needed the place.  Needless to say this is NOT worth the extra money.  CANNOT wait to get out of here!  I can’t tell you how much I advise you run as fast as possible.  Let them fill up the place with Section 8 if they want, don’t spend your hard earned money here.<//Text>< date>

<text>You would expect that a big corporation running this large apartment complex would have good customer service but the maintenance could not be worst. They initially show you the models which are remodeled but the units they lease are in very poor condition. The appliances are very old, bathrooms are in horrible shape carpets are old. They promise to make the repairs but they never show up which is very disrespectful to the tenant. It seems they don't care at all. This is the worst location to move.

Nice staff, "clean" model unit so we decided to apply for a move in date the week after and they assured me that the unit will be ready. We paid $100 for the applications fees that they said they would credit to our moving cost, They pushed us to pay $300 to hold the apartment which we did. Then 2 days before the move in, I called to confirm the time with them and they told me that they didn't even have the keys of the unit and they couldn't reach the tenants so they didn't know when it would be ready!!
So I asked them to have a refund of my deposit and my applications fees for the inconvenience since I applied thinking that the unit will be ready!
They said the property manager wasn't there and to call the corporate office which I did but of course no one was available!
I finally was able to get my $300 back after wasting hours on the phone with this unprofessional company but I NEVER had a call back from property manager nor their corporate office.
I was extremely disappointed at the time by them especially their agent Patricia who was all sweet to get my money but didn't seems to be concerned by my issue after that.
Now I am very grateful that THEY avoid me the hassle of dealing with this shady place for 12 months! Horrible experience!</review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I wouldn't even give this place a star if I didn't have too.  I cant wait to leave here.  If you go to yelp and read all the reviews I can guarantee they are telling the truth.  I wouldn't even know where to begin in telling you my horrible experiences here.   Unlawful entry, damaged furniture, over 1 month to fix leaks after it flooded my upstairs bedroom.  They don't respond to calls all the time. Just a few things.  Oh, also just recently my lease was signed I believe on may 1 of this year and they made a mistake in the monthly amount and so they tried to change it by erasing my lease that they had in their portal and expect me to pay more.  Who tries to change a legally signed lease for gain?  I wouldn't have stayed longer but rent everywhere else right now is horrible.  good luck to all in their search.</Text>< pictures>

I've lived here for a year, when I first moved in and before I signed the lease, I asked if outside parking was available for one of my cars, Juan (our leasing agent) at the time was very helpful and got me an outside parking sticker, that was before he got fired, THE SUMMIT has new staff every month! Anyway  back to my parking situation, so new management came in and I got a letter stating that if I want to park outside I'd have to pay $100 for a parking pass every month or else your car will get towed!!

I got a Lease renewal and rent is being raised by $200 a month, WELCOME TO THE SUMMIT!! There's too many reasons for why you (and your family) do not want to live here. Unless it's something temporary (at your own risk)

DO NOT RECOMMEND THE SUMMIT AT WARNER CENTER TO ANYONE!! THIS PLACE IS A RIPOFF</review>

The Summit supposedly was a nice exclusive place to live at some point.. It's now a trashy joke with old run down homes and 5-6 gates for anyone to follow another car in.. Complete false sense of security!! Why even have guard gated house when there's so many other ways to drive in... And with all that security why do the pools always have teens smoking pot?!< /Text>

This place is a joke. The monthly rent is sometimes wrong and is over-charging us. Although we have paid our utility, the management double-charged the same bill. When we tried to talk to them about this, they just said they were not responsible for the billing system??? Again, this place is a definite joke.

I used to live in this community for more than three years and when I wanted to evacuate the unit , every thing was changed and the leasing staffs was so rude to me . I was expecting to get a call from them , but they didn’t call me ever !!! I called them ten times but they didn’t call me back. Now after one month , they didn’t send me my deposit check !!!<//review>

<Review>Horrible management! Warning: DO NOT MOVE HERE! You will regret it. I have been living here for 1 year and I cannot express how disappointed I am in this community. It is so poorly operated, overpriced, no rules are enforced and it is an embarrassment to anyone living here. The property has the potential to be a lovely community but unfortunately it is not due to the ridiculous policies, terrible management and lack of respect for the rules, and it's getting worse not better. I can't wait until my lease is up. I will be running my family out of here.<//Review><Rating>1<//Rating>< Name>

this is the most arrogant management and staff, i have ever dealt with. the managements are rude and their attitude reflects on the staff that they don't respect any resident and if they can call you a liar they will. the water bill is over $180 each month with ridiculous and it's prorated to their favour which means sometimes you may pay for your neighbours if the management decided to. all amenities are not even functioned and nothing in a working condition. Just wasting your money at such community full of fraud. lots of residents on section 8 and all time just smoking weed and lots of deliveries been stolen as if i rented an apartment in the PROJECTS in PACOIMA.
the security gates most of the time are broken so anyone can just enter the compound and scratch your car as it happened few times and the management claims it's not their responsibility to fix the gates. the pools are been cleaned every 3 months despite the fact that they get dirty so fast because lots dust and disrespectful residents who eats and drink inside the water. the sauna has been malfunctioned since 8 months ago and when you talk to the residents services they direct you to the most despicable person who works their " AMAL " who tells you why you need to use it, or, we are fixing them. so basically you will be paying for amenities you will never use and you will be over charged for everything.<//review>

Not perfect but still a decent place. I do wish it was a little less ghetto though. Lots of people overcrowding trash bins and noise increasing...must be taking sec 8? Rumor does have it...management is always stressed  sometimes things take awhile to get done.  But for the most part the maintenance ppl are great and its a fun place!  Watch for gangs.... loud leaf blowers though....good stuff: Close to malls... beautiful and serene vibes apt but watch for pollens and allergies and black widows ....   Bathtubs hella clausterphobic and small but the townhouses are 2 story and cool and comfy minus tiny baths.  Lots of good and bad qualities here  more good than bad though...depends what is important to you!  and now they might paint this place a puke brown  not looking forward to that</Text>

<review>DO NO SIGN A LEASE WITH THIS PLACE ! THEY ARE COMPLETE CROOKS ! There security guards sit around all day smoking weed in the front. And impound cars as they feel. Also they showed me one place and when I signed the lease gave me another. Then when I complained about it the put me into a half way renovated unit. Where doors won't close completely and bathroom and kitchen sinks are still causing leaks. They cannot be trusted at the lessening building mainly the manger VEIRA ! She will not help you with any community issues or even take your phone call for that matter. Thier leasing agents are horrible they make promises that they can't keep. They don't explain rules in detail. They didn't even show me where my mail box was or the trash. I had to wonder out and figure these things on my own.These people are looking for the fastest buck possible so they sign whoever to do jus that. The community is always dirty it seems know one up there care to make sure the property is clean. The owners of this building need to get a complete new staff. Nothing about this place is good ! I promise you the amount of money you would spend in this place you can find something better in Woodland Hills ! These pictures they show of the town homes are INACCURATE !</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

In case anyone thought it has gotten better, it has not. Leasing agents are nice and helpful; however, getting an answer from anyone else (the manager or billing person), forget about it. I think it all stems from the owners, GHP Mgmt.  They don't care about the residents; they only care about $$$

Important fact: Summit manages the water, trash and sewer bill and they DO NOT provide you with documentation to support why you are being charged $XX amount each month.  They do provide a breakdown based on your square footage, but they do not show you how they calculate the $ factor which is multiplied by your square footage.  Total con and will not provide answers. Can't wait to move!<//Text>

<text>The staff are very rude and pay no attention about what you request. The pool are very dirty and I never see the water been replaced. Their staff does not even knok your door when entering into your apart. They promised a parking garage when we move in and until we move out, they never assigned us a garage. Their manage never respond any email or phone call send by residents. Never and ever conside this community.< /text>< Pics>

I have lived here for 2 years and the window dressing on the show apartments are just that. I couldn't figure out how to arrange my rant so the problems below are in no particular order:

1. Security. Technically this is a gated community. Yes there are gates and when you sign the lease you are required to list your common visitors so they can be let in without security calling you. The problem is they let everyone in. The security guard, although be it nice, just asks what address you are visiting. They write up a sheet of paper (which no copy is made) and then they send each visitor on their marry way. Additionally, at least 1 gate is always broken and left wide open.

2. Customer Service. The Leasing office is beautiful. The staff are useless. They are usually too busy gossiping or eating to give you their full attention.

3. Maintenance. If you want something fixed don't fill out the on-line request because it dies a slow death in a black hole until you call and speak to a Customer Service Rep in the front office (see #2). Last winter it took them 3 weeks to fix the heat because the maintenance tech who works on heat was on vacation. In lieu of calling a vendor was to provide a tiny space heater, which I had to sign for just in case it was lost so they could charge me for it. Another example, all my showers were leaking, couldn't tighten them enough. I had to request they be fixed 3 times before they actually stopped leaking.

4. The Apartment. I have a 3 bedroom apartment that has been "Upgraded". Let me translate what that means. 1. cheap marble counters in the bathrooms and kitchen, that have holes in them and are not properly sealed. 2. Cabinets from 1980 that have 30 coats of paint. The top coat is this dark chocolate brown that when it chips has yellowy-white paint underneath. Also the entire cabinet is not painted, just the faces. The heating/cooling units are the original ones from when the unit were built in the 70/80's. They are loud and don't work very well. For the first 3 months (in the summer) we called the Maintenance group once a week to check on them until the maintenance tech let me know they were old and never going to work the way I wanted. I appreciated his honestly, but I still upset about the situation.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80c29c277c92448b:0xefe69268eb6ce5b2</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Not only is the Summit at Warner Center filled with Pornstars (I don't have a big problem with it, except they broadcast it outside their windows while my 8 year old is playing outside), Drug dealers(our next door neighbors) that bring in doped up crackhead looking people that break into your homes when your away. We have lived here for about 8 months and their has been two helicopter search and finds with the police blocking the exits yelling at everyone to stay inside. Then to add to the horrible experience we are having here at THE SUMMIT, there was a shooting at the drug dealers place next door to us. As we were trying to sleep while they were partying loudly we heard a fight break out and gun shots. And don't even think about complaining to the management, they only give you the run around. But that's not all, as if it weren't enough. We have had about 50 maintenance problems. From every facet in the apt. leaking, as well as under the sinks, to having no heat in the winter and no air conditioning in the hot 100 degree summer in the valley. I'm not one to complain so much but this place does suck. When they send someone to fix it the problem only gets worse. Now that they have supposedly fixed our air we now have a leak in the ceiling above the thermostat. I noticed a stain in the ceiling the day we moved in but it had been painted over. I didn't think anything of it but now I've realized that the people who lived here before had the same problem and instead of fixing the problem for the new tenets, they only painted over the water stain. Talk about saving money. But you won't save any if you rent here. THE SUMMIT apts are not worth what they charge. Not at all. You'd be better off living in a box.
And what the other guy said about the water being off, he was right. The water has been shut off twice since we've lived here and they've giving us the same excuse about a pipe bursting in the street. Uh hum. Yeah, or maybe they didn't pay their water bill on time. Instead of spending so much money on the Oasis landscaping, they might want to try using our rent money to repair our apts properly and pay the water bill! We are so breaking our lease and getting the hell out of here! And by the way don't believe anything management says especially TeTe. Just stay away... far far away.</Review>

For the price that you pay it is very low class building.
Poor management

<review>I went to Bootie on March 10th. It was my first time, and it was a blast. The house band were really awesome, the mashups were great.

The place got a little too crowded for my liking at about 11:30. I stuck to the upstairs lounge which was nice and the bartender there was very kind.

I thought the crowd would be a bit older, but it was fine how it was, everyone was having a good time.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

What a fun place! We came here during Bootie 90s Mashup night, and the line was super long to get in. There was cover too, which I hate, but i oblige b/c it was for a friend's bday.

The inside is like a boat, with pirate themed. The music was great and the crowd was good that night, so 4 solid stars.</Review>

The barber knows how to cut and style my thick and straight hair. I like that my hair got washed before the cut and dry after the cut. It was a very exceptional service. I will go back to this Barbershop next time!< /text>

<Text>Little dude on the second chair to your left side of the entrance messed up my hair. Did a nice fade but the top side, well, looks like he used a grass cutter on it. And charged me 18, and I tipped the guy 2 dollars lol When I saw the mess he did after I showered, wow. and Gel does miracles to semi hide the piece of work he did.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Where do I start ? I loved from to Cali or a year ago.  Before I left Chicago I had gotten an undercut.  I am natural and been natural for approx 7 years. I have 4c and d hair.  Texture is everything and fading properly is important.  NEXT is amazing,  accommodating,  his skillset is multifaceted and appreciated.  He always get me right!  Thanks.  Y'all stop in and & tell him I sent you!! 😘🤗< /text>

I moved near the area and this was the closest Barbershop here and I am glad that I found this place. Haircuts and customer service is great and they actually take their time making sure the cut is perfect and most importantly they have many barbers that way you are in and out fast.< /Text>

I came to just get my beard cleaned up. Marvin took care of me. I asked him to do a taper fade on top part of my beard trimmed it and lined it up. He took his time and to ensure it was all done right. Thanks Marvin!</text>

Great place to cut your hair. Very clean and all the barbers know what they're doing. $13 for a great cut is amazing. Would recommend for anyone that needs a barber in the area.<//Review>

First time coming to this location. Wanted to get a haircut before work. I asked for a medium fade and the guy ends of shaving 80% of my head. It was a horrible haircut. Had to call out of work. Then he blames me telling me I didn’t ask for the correct haircut. Looks like I just got unlucky and got the only guy in the barbershop who didn’t know how to do fades. The other two that were cutting hair were doing a great job.< /text>

The barbers here are very talented and have had years of experience. I always get my high fade double zero sides and my 3 on top. Always comes out crisp. I always go with Rudy the only one with a red chair but I have gone with every other Barber they are great as well.< /text>

Been coming here for a little while . I have three boys and this is the place to go to . Great service , they do an amazing job and if you show them a picture of how you want the haircut they do leave it looking the same ! Love it . The place is really clean and they even have a vending machine . I highly recommend it.<//text>

Awesome customer service!! Took my mom for some pampering, we had pedicure and manicure's plus she had her nails polished with different Easter colors.
Lucy was very personable with my mother they both enjoyed the experience, talking and laughing. Thank you Lucy for making it a great relaxing day of pampering for my mother.
Kim and Cathy helped me out. Cathy did my pedicure which was amazingly good, my feet and legs felt relaxed and refreshed. Plus the nail polish I chose came out perfect for Easter sandals. Kim did awesome full set of acrylic nails. I was very pleased and thankful for such awesome service.
Thank you KC Nails & Spa, you are now our go to place. God bless and thank you.
Added note: They had very reasonable prices.

Leyna and KC always do a wonderful job with my nails. I chose to get a new set today and I always worry about getting my old nails taken off. Leyna did a wonderful job. I didn't feel a thing and my nails look beautiful 😍< /Review>

Worst place ever! Showed up for an appointment only to be told that it was on the a different day! I Purposely took time off of work in order to get my services done. I checked in sat dawn for a good 5-10 minutes only to then be turned away. They didnt have an issue taking my $160.00 2 weeks ago for a full set pedicure and waxing. And now that THEY made a mistake they couldn’t accommodate a fill.<//text>

Today i just walked in and Kathy gave me the best pedicure I have ever gotten.
I had the spa procedure with callus remover and Kathy not only cut away all my ugly dead skin from my feet but she also dug out an ingrown toenail that had been bugging me forever.
I hate when i go to the spa and they rush you in and out...but not Kathy, she is an expert and gave me a great foot and leg massage before painting my toes. I will be her customer from now on.
I truly wish i would of taken a picture of my feet before she transformed them into feet even my husband would love.
Thank you Kathy, I'm your customer forever.</text>

They were kind, respectful and did a good job. Had to wait a half hour for person to arrive for my pre set appointment. Charged extra for removal of my gel polish.< /text>

My fiancee and I been going to KC nails for years. The nail shop looks fantastic, clean, neat, and very organized. Her staff threat us like very valued customers and family. The prices there are great and they are very detailed oriented in all the services they offer. KC is a perfectionist with her nail design and it shows in her finished product. We will continue to be loyal customers that look forward to recommending to our family and friends. If you need a really good pedi and would like the works Desiree is the best. Thank you KC and your team for always giving us your best.</Review>

Lovely people, I have never been happy with my nails nor have I had the best experience when getting them done. But the lady who did mine was wonderful and worked with me even though they didn't have my color. I cannot wait to show them off at prom.</review>

<Time>1490463922594< /Time><text>I thought this was going to be my permanent nail place, but I was wrong. They usually did a good job, but my last visit with a friend  (her first time going here) was really bad. They didn't ask us what kind of pedicures we wanted by showing us their menu. They just assumed regular pedicures. I asked the lady when she started to put the paper between my toes if she was done, after a really poor job of cleaning up my toenails and what felt about a 30 second rub on each foot, and she said yes! It cost me $20.65 for the worst pedicure I've ever had. Then I was going to get a full set with the white glitter powder and first the last told me it wouldn't look good (this is how I always get my nails done) and then she said she didn't have the white glitter powder. When I went up to pay there was a big jar of the white glitter powder! Really poor service. Then they tried to say next time will be better, but why would anybody go back after that?<//text>< gmap_id>

I'm hoping for something better in the future. Might return for a pedicure every now and then but their prices are crazy high. Wanted to have my kids all pampered but ended up getting simple manicures because gel is over double the price of a regular manicure. How is nail Polish worth that much? No way. So i doubt this will be my regular spot but their service was pretty nice. My deluxe pedicure was awesome and i felt like she rele cared about me feeling good. Lavender mask and warm lotion and hot towels and everything was just so calming. Thanks for that but maybe make prices more competitive.< /Text>

The tiny Asian Lady complained about the condition of my feet as she was working hard sanding and scraping my rough feet, I am guy and they are suppose to be rough:) I did not get offended I just sat back and watch her huff and puff as she put her back into it. It felt GREAT watching her sweat....I got all my monies worth. I then went and played Golf at General Olds Country Club! Word of caution to the owners, be careful of what you say to your customers as it will reflect in your time and loosing clients, Most Macho Guys do not go into to salons!   If the work is too hard find another job!</text>

<Review>I had a pleasant visit with William. He was very patient with me and answered all of my questions. I haven’t had great experiences at other stores, so I’m glad I had such a pleasant interaction. I will definitely be coming back to this store. William was super helpful with helping my family and I upgrade our lines. He was very informative and for every problem we had he had a solution. I’ve been to multiple AT&T locations and by far he’s given us the best service. 10 stars!!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<text>Had the best experience ever. Ended up getting an 11 instead of the 11pro I ordered online and the return was taking care of with no hassle by David L. Escalante. Ended up walking out happier with a blue 12 pro and a new phone case a phone cover and a quick charger. Thanks agin and a big shout out to this store and the great customer service and to the man that helped me David J. Escalate.< /text>< UserId.>

I stopped by at random to have my iPad Air's cellular function activated. While there, I went ahead and had my Apple Watch series 6 activated for cellular use without the need to have my phone with me at the same time. I was assisted by Joe Russo. He immediately greeted me in a genuinely friendly and helpful manner. He was a complete professional; highly knowledgeable on the products, and he accomplished what I needed with speed and efficiency. I'm not tech savvy, and Joe patiently and thoroughly answered all questions I had. He was a true pleasure to deal with and through the process we enjoyed great conversation. I've been into several AT&T stores, but never came close to having such a high quality experience as I did at this one. Joe is a true asset to that store specifically, and AT&T generally. I'll definitely be back.<//Text>

I was greeted as I walked in and taken to a station where I told Joe why I came in and I feel very satisfied with how he answered all my questions and went over what I am using now and what else I could use even giving me notes so if I wanted to upgrade at another time I could.  I have been with ATT for years and this store has always had great customer service. Thanks for hiring competent people< /Review>

<Review>Excellent experience and a big part of that was because of Tammy and her assistance. She helped us get a new phone and set up everything, even showing us a discount that we qualified for!

<review>Cameron was so pleasant and professional to work with. I know there are other services cheaper than AT&T, but I’ve always been a fan of their customer service. This is the second store my husband and I went to for new phones and every time we are just continuously impressed. Make sure you look for him when you come to the AT&T Pleasant Hill store.<//review></record></dataset><record>

My mother in law decided to go in today at this location her experience with the customer service representative was great although she mentioned to me that there was a few people sneezing in the store and one person particularly was sneezing a lot. I don’t know what kind of measures this location is taking for COVID-19 but my only suggestion would be to not have those kind of people in the store whether it be customers or employees this made my mother in law very uncomfortable but she couldn’t leave because she needed to get done with her situation there. It makes me uncomfortable as well if my mother in law was in there with someone who could possible have this virus I really hope this gets to a manager and makes some readjustments, other than that she said the man helping her was very kind and informative!<//review>

Albert is one of a kind!

We had an appointment just to replace a sim card and he proceeded to take his time to review our plan line by line!

These are the types of ATT representatives that we need more of. Someone who is patient and doesn’t feel the need to address one issue and send you off on your way.

We will be in touch Albert! Thank you!< /Review>

My experience was horrible. No one wanted to help. Employees were playing hacky sack instead of helping out. Finally a manager came to see what was going on because we weren't getting helped and we were getting frustrated. He then asked for my phone and scanned it. Which made no sense because I brought my mother there who's the customer. Not me. Then I see that a review was made (not by me) by the store on my behalf. Unbelievable that a manager would do that.<//Text>

This store signed me up with the highest plan without my consent. Adding Interent Services to my call back phone (work.phone) all this was done by a store rep. Called customer service in order to undo all of the above. This is what these reps do for commission. Called today to speak to s manager was put on hold for 10mins. Hung up and called back to be
told that all managers are in a meeting and it would be awhile.  When entering into this store be mindful of every step.you  take. Check your service to make sure you're not charged for something you didn't authorize.
Terrible  service behind your back. In your face eager to help!<//Text>

I want to preface this with..  I hate going to the phone store.. to me it’s equivalent to going to the dentist. Today Cameron helped my husband and I make some account changes, he was super friendly, got everything done super fast, and had us on our way in less than 15 minutes. Hopefully he’s around next time we have to go back!<//Review>

I had a great help and very patient helper, her name is Selam. She is very detail and helpful thru out the long process of getting my account clarified. She is great, she should be recognized as top associates of AT&T in Pleasant Hill store. Many. Many thanks to her for helping me. A salute to her!<//Text>

I came into the Monument Concord store after getting transferred agent after agent over the phone due to having issues activating a new account and linking Sim cards (ATT agents errors) I was quickly greeted by Daniel Kim and he was patient with me and went over all my concerns and issues I was having with activating/joining ATT. He went above and beyond to explain every option and exhausted all solutions to get my account going. I spent hours with Daniel while he double checked and confirmed every way possible that my account was set up correctly and all our phones were working properly while being ported from our old cellular provider. I greatly appreciate his time and help and the service I received while inside the store. There was also a situation where someone came in aggressively and making a scene over being anti-mask and the ATT agents there quickly and discretely de-escalated the situation. After almost giving up on ATT due my my customer service over the phone - Daniel and his team made me hopeful to be a new ATT member.<//Text>

This was a great experience.
My husband and I rarely ever come into these stores but today was very much worth it representative was extremely helpful and very knowledgeable she was very kind and took her time to explain everything to my husband and I we aren’t very good with smart phones but Jimena took the time to let us know everything along with promotions on our phones we left very satisfied and very comfortable store was clean we had a few representatives ask us if we were already helped showed us attentiveness which we really appreciate we recommend this store highly and if you ever need help please find Jimena !<//Text>

Thank you, Abby

The following day I had to return to the AT&T store with assistance downloading my contact list as I could not figure it out.
As I entered to store I was greeting by Rodrigo and I explained my situation.

Within a few minutes he had my contact list downloading and as I was waiting for the information to exchange to the new phone, Rodrigo kept checking with me to be sure all contacts were completed.

I’d like to share my very positive experience with the good people at thisAT&T Store.

Very Professional and great energy-

Sincerely

< Review>
I had a wonderful experience at AT&T this evening!! I just moved to Walnut Creek and prolonged my process with getting WiFi for my new place ! I decided to go AT&T  route. I was assisted  by Joseph at the Pleasant Hill branch near monument Boulevard.He was very informative ,patient, held a positive energy throughout my installation setup.He did an amazing job and got the job done in an exceptional amount of time.Upon departing l ssooooooo appreciate the generosity of going the extra mile to open the door as me and my family was leaving. Thankful and glad that l came to AT&T for our service. Remarkable experience.

My faith in AT&T’s customer service has been restored after my most recent visit to the Pleasant Hill store. Abigail was a terrific saleswoman. From the point of contact to the final handshake, she demonstrated the utmost professionalism. She was well-informed about all of the services and products AT&T has to offer, and was patient in explaining everything. She answered all of my questions and was very friendly. I was able to walk away with a shiny new IPhone 11 Pro, with all of the best accessories to put the cherry on top. It didn’t even cost me an arm and a leg! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND asking for Abigail to help you if you go to this location. She is patient and intelligent, and she understands the needs of her customers. Thank you for the great service!< /review>

< Review>
I went into the phone yesterday JUST to pick up my phone, which was being repaired for a cracked screen. I arrived exactly at 4pm, which is when I was told to come back, and was informed the technician was at lunch. So one of the other workers started chatting me up about my phone plan and tablets and everything else they had to offer. I didn’t mind getting more info about plans, but made it clear I wasn’t changing anything right now.
He then asked if I’d heard about AT&T tv and if he could show me its features. I politely decline, saying I have no use for it. He insisted anyways, chuckling and saying “Well, can’t I just SHOW you?” (As if he wasn’t trying to push product). Too polite to say no, I let me show me the TV features. Afterwards, he asked if I could see myself getting something like that and if I wanted more info. I again declined, saying I have no use for it, and he looked surprised (he clearly wasn’t listening to me before...) and after that he starts talking about the apple watches and asking me if I wear a watch. I more firmly said no, I have no use for it and after that he finally went and got the tech to get my damn phone.
Jeff was extremely polite and I enjoyed chatting with him, but WAY too pushy on product and plans. I would’ve been content to just wait for my phone. Was there a quota to meet? Is the company requiring employees to do that? Because it’s not a good way to keep customers. No means no bruh. Felt like my politeness and time were taken advantage of. Nobody likes feeling like they’re not being listened to.< /Review>

The staff are not willing to help if there is a problem with your account.  They don't value customers and only see them as $$  that they can sell a phone to.  My experience here lead me to move to another carrier, don't waste your time going into this store for help.<//Text>

Probably one of THE best and most helpful AT&T stores out there. I went recently during the rush of the iPhone pre-order and it went as smooth as possible. Alberto was my AT&T attendant and now I will always be going back to him for his help and service.<//Review>

What happened to being kind and patient? What happened to good customer service? Carla, SMILE and watch your tone. Treat your customers with respect. Meet your customer where they're at. We are people not a sales pitch.  You work with the public. This was not a good experience and we will only be back to see Ballal the manager</review>

Worst experience. Must score as -5, but don't have this option, so 1. Waited for 20 minutes to get agent who i need to teach about their offers. Then he gave me tablet to fill my name and other having my ID in front of him and started using his phone for reading/chatting (newer! customer is filling anything on agent's device). Waisted 25 minutes speaking with him and got nothing.
Be aware or switch agent if you see he does not do what you came for.
For manager: 18 of august 2018, visited at about 1.20 pm. Named myself as John since i have hard legal name.<//text>

<Review>Been a loyal customer  for over 15 years , been satisfied with the service until walked in to get help at the Pleasant Hill store today . What a disappointment.  No body wanted to answer
any questions, referred to on line help yourself.  We are TOO BUSY DOING NOTHING.. make me considering maybe I should go to VERIZON .
Maybe that's what I will do .< /Review><GmapID>0x8085613eb5061af3:0x6d9f5989b54ed0e7< /GmapID><pics>None< /pics>< name>

Upgraded to a new iPhone today, with much help from Selam. I am not very knowledgeable  with these fancy smart phones, and Selam spent over 2 hours helping me transfer all the data from my very old iphone to the newer model. Thank you so much, Selam!  I appreciate your patience and your expertise!<//Text>

<text>How can 1 store cause a 13 year, 6 line family plan client to switch carriers? By staffing it with people that simply do not care at all about the customer. I get they likely are paid lousy wages, but to actually not even listen to what the customer is saying?! When he is there to BUY a $1400 phone on pre-order? They don't get commissions or was he that dumb? Who knows. What I do know that ATT loyalty program is helping to save account.</text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Not at all pleased with the service.  I'm not one to spread bad news. I normally save my reviews to highlight legitimately good businesses.

But these guys were pretty bad. We walked in and were greeted only to be put on a list. Then we had to wait for about 10 minutes. I didn't get it being that the employees outnumbered the customers about 3:1.

Then we were finally greeted and by a girl who was nice all the way until we told her we didn't want to buy their silly warranty. Then she became even more sour when we turned down an $80 phone case.

What makes it worse was that I heard the manager asking her what we were getting (2 new iPhones) and the watched him go grab the $80 case to have her try and sell it to us.

We finished the rest of the transaction in relative silence. Then we took our new phones and left.

Love the phones but hope to never again return to that store ever.

Cheesy tactics. Bad customer service. Should have gone somewhere else.<//Text>

If I had the chance I wouldn't even give them even 1 star. Worse customer service ever I had with AT&T, first the offer something good and after they make the contract they change everything they said. I had the TV plan with unlimited data and what I have received from them was my house is not getting any signals so I won't be able to get it and this is what they should have asked me right at the beginning not when they contracted is done and in the end they leave you with the worse option ever. Moreover the associates don't even care and they just turned their back and pretend you are not even there.<//Text>

If I had the chance I wouldn't even give them even 1 star. Worse customer service ever I had with AT&T, first the offer something good and after they make the contract they change everything they said. I had the TV plan with unlimited data and what I have received from them was my house is not getting any signals so I won't be able to get it and this is what they should have asked me right at the beginning not when they contracted is done and in the end they leave you with the worse option ever. Moreover the associates don't even care and they just turned their back and pretend you are not even there.< /Text>

< review>
I went to the AT&T store in Martinez.  The guy there wasn't very helpful.  I was there looking for help on a few work tablets.  I felt like he didn't want to help me since I wasn't purchasing anything.  So, I took a chance and went to the Pleasant Hill store (the one by Kohl's).  A guy named Dirk Tolson was very helpful.  He got one of two of the tablets working and the third one he confirmed it was damaged.  The difference in the service between the stores is like night and day.  Thank you Dirk.</review>

< review>
Waited in line and was put on queue whatever and d guy who put me said he cannot help me. I ask a lady I guess she was the manager after waiting for a while and told d guy who said he cannot help me to help me so I was relief and rolled my eyes bc all the waiting I did this guy can actually do it for me. But this lady lashed out on me not knowing what happen telling me “I don’t appreciate the eye rolling” I was going to apologize to her bc she didn’t know y I did that and it was not meant for her but reading all d reviews HELL NO!!!! TREAT UR CUSTOMERS RIGHT! AT&T BETTER READ THE REVIEWS!<//review>

14 customers waiting. 1 employee at the door signing people in. 1 employee helping people. 3 employees at lunch. Looks like district should find someone else to run this store since this manager can't seem to figure out how to schedule his people.<//review>

Horrible. Absolute worst customer service ever. Refused to put a screen protector on for me after I paid $150 for my phone. The manager is complete moron as well, he's the bald fat jerk. His name is Seth Mincer. Yes, even his name is stupid. Go to ANY ATT store except this one and they will help you. This store is run like a 3rd world country might be. With no order and chaos.</Text>

<text>great i am the first one to review.

i warned you. never ever get directtv.

they have hidden fees that they will not tell you. you will get charge no matter what and they will only say "i am sorry" but you will srill get billed and pay for even you do not neccessarily need it.

most everyone knows att has bad customer service.

call customer service and you will experience high volume call for an hour.

i recommend TMOBILE. i am a loyal customer of TMobile.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

They should hire more people to work in the evening and set up a triage system so short tasks (like SIM cards) aren't waiting in the same line as long tasks (like shopping for a new device).<//text>< Pics>

Our trip to AT&T today was smooth and informative. Daniel helped with our upgrades and transactions. He was also very informative on the latest plans, upgrading our phones, and overall the knowledge on the products. He was patient and friendly which made our experience great. Upon arrival, it was a very busy time but Daniel made sure to be attentive to our needs and questions. He made sure each and every step along the way was understood. Thank you for your help and exceptional customer service Daniel!</Text>
