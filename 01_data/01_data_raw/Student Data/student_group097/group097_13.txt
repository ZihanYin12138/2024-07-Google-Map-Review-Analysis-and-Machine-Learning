The friendliest shop owner ever!! I Always go here. And it's always consistent. The quality of kind and fast service. He's got everything you could want from every type of bong to every flavor of backwoods!  Also he is willing to drop prices to please his customers. What else could you want???  Definitely recommend this shop. And they stay open late</review>

Stopped by for the first time and was helped out by Faddy I believe was his name. Very chill shop and wasn't pressured or rushed to buy anything. They have a very great selection of quality thick glass at great prices that won't disappoint.
If in the market for new glass, be sure to check these guys out first. Will definitely be back</Review>

<text>Awesome place. Went in with a problem and they handled it professionally and with care. Then returned shortly after to pick up a bowl piece I should have grabbed the first time.

Sam is the man, if you don't know what a product is just give Sam a description of what your looking for and Sam will tell you what it is how to use it what's the leading brand and always has the best deals on everything.  Oh and you can pick up an Ice Cream or Soda and your favorite Lottery Tickets while your there. Great products great atmosphere,  great people so if your close by I suggest you go there because they got some Swisher Sweets Kiwi Strawberry flavor...  See you there...</text>

Went there a few times after work, which was cool. The service was on point, selection and lrices are great. However, today i went at 10:15am, only to walk up to a locked door. So i look up the hours and it says they open at 9. I find this incredibly irritating, and dont think ill be going back again. I chose this spot because it was conviniently on my way home from work when i get off at 10:00. Not being open when you say you are and making me hunt down another shop is not convenient. Taking my money elsewhere.<//Text>

We had a great experience at Headwaters. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. No pressure sales. It's great to be able to rent/demo a kayak before buying and they apply your rental cost to your purchase if you decide to buy one. Highly recommend anyone in the market for a decent kayak to go to Headwaters versus the big box stores.</Text>

<text>We took a Kayak safety and rescue class with Tiffany through Headwaters. She was patient and helpful teaching us different rescue methods and providing safety instruction. Our level of confidence rose significantly as we both feel much more comfortable should an incident occur requiring a rescue. We had fun and learned a lot.< /text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

Shop is clean, organized. Staff is professional, attentive, knowledgeable, friendly. I will send anyone who asks me to this shop for their kayak and water needs. My wife and I enjoyed the visit and experience.

Next day we took a kayak class and it was really fun. We learned a lot. Tiffani was our instructor and she was a delight to have as an instructor. Kudos to Headwaters Adventure Co., Thanks so much.<//Review>

<Review>Had so much fun at the moonlight kayak session! Kutras was a nice quiet spot for the evening and I hope that they do the moonlighting session again. Everyone was very nice and helpful and they even had glow sticks for our kayaks when we went out!</Review>< pics>

We just got back from a nice 2 hour kayak trip out on the river. Honestly, this was an amazing experience. The rental was really easy to arrange via their website last night and picking everything up was a breeze this morning. Took our little guy out on a tandem with me and we all had a blast. If you're in Redding and you don't hit these guys up, you're missing out!</text>

Can't say enough about the team. We went in after some research and Sandy helped set us up with all the other stuff that goes with. We have a new addiction. From Black Butte to Lewiston we are so happy with fishing kayaks.</text>

They offer great customer service.They don't have multiple selections of everything but they have everything you need which makes them unique. They offer items of quality that you could buy online but won't find at the larger stores in town. I prefer supporting a smaller local business over a large national any day but especially when the service is exceptional.< /review>< Pics>

I have been a paddler for many years and without a local kayak company. It is nice to have Headwaters here. In my opinion they carry some of the best paddling gear available including Jackson kayaks, Kokatat and Werner paddles. They have a great crew. I am thankful to have them here.<//Text>

I take my 2 boys here regularly and I’ve collected a bunch of the after 9 haircuts the 10th haircut is free cards and wouldn’t you know it, all of a sudden they don’t accept them anymore. She said because of the pandemic, but I feel like they should have honored it because we used to come here regularly before the pandemic. I guess we will find a new haircut spot for that specific reason. After at least $144 worth of haircuts (more because I rarely remember about those cards) I think they could have honored one of the 3 haircuts. I understand the pandemic crucially hurt small businesses but I’ve been taking my kids here for years and years.<//text>

< review>
Got a standard military style cut from Maria here, she is wonderful. First, she was very attentive to wiping away fallen hair on my face. (Masks make it much worse). When buzzing around around my ears, she took great care to get under the mask strings without removing the mask. The cut was not rough, she was easy with the clippers to not throw my head around. Finally it's exactly how I wanted it. Thank you.</review>

I highly recommend Family Cuts. I was getting my haircut at Supercuts, but I found this place and I've been going there ever since.

There is only one woman that has cut my hair so far and she does a better job than anyone has in the past. And some of you may not agree but one of the best parts of my experience at Family Cuts is that the stylist isn't a chatterbox. She really doesn't say anything, lol. She gets the job done and I'm on my way!

The place is quiet, tucked away so it's never packed. If that's the kind of experience you're interested in, again, I highly recommend it.<//review>

Went to get a really radical hair cut. They did an amazing job in my hair. I will definitely go back for my trims. The ladies there are really friendly and know what they're doing.</Text>

Impeccable stylists, charming, they LISTEN to their customers 😊I have never looked back once I had my first cut and tint.😆. I have enjoyed their attention for 5 years. I purchase products,  and had make up services. What a Gem in this neighborhood 😊🎋🎶Great Music! !!<//Review>

Overall with all my experiences: Wrong charges! Crooked haircuts! Bad coloring! Rude to customers!

Go to the swap meet instead.

I have come to this place over 4 times now and today was the last straw. In the beginning it was fine, but later on the owner, Lucy, started being rude to me and wouldn't choose to cut my hair even when I had asked for her beforehand.

Lucy also didn't do my hair they way I had asked for and instead she made some other lady do it. The other lady didn't bleach or tone my hair beforehand so she dyed my hair with the dye. Take note I wanted my hair lighter and if you just add in the dye without anything to help lighten it up it wouldn't work. So my hair ended up dark no blow dry. When I asked for a blow dry she put me under the machine where you sit under for highlights!

This lady had also cut my hair in the past and made my hair so crooked my co-workers would even point that out to me!

Not professional at all. My total was also $85 plus $30 just to fix it. No free of charge just a bad discount. Lucy even calculated it wrong charging me $120 instead!

The haircut sign is wrong it can be MUCH more expensive seeing the UP next to the prices. Calculates prices by what she sees and feels like (ex. she charges by how long your hair is with coloring) she even told customers to go somewhere else because they would charge less than her.
The owner saying that herself.< /Review>

<UserId.>100666917945395839769</UserId.><rating>2</rating><review>I called for pricing before visiting this shop. I was told $17.95 for a womans cut, and $26.95 for shampoo, cut, n style by someone with a strong Asian accent. I found those prices acceptable, and went in. The girl who cut my hair, actually did a nice job. But when I went to the counter, another woman told me $45. Umm, no, I was told $26.95 for a shampoo, cut, n style. I didnt even get a shampoo. She refused to go down on price, and asked the Asian girl if she gave me a price over the phone. Then turned to me and said she told you up. I heard her. Ummm, how did you hear her if you just had to ask her if she even told me over the phone.  Poor form, very disappointing. Will not return.< /review><gmap_id>0x80c368a07d469c59:0xdc9c3a3f70ce8c90<//gmap_id>< Pictures>

<Review>Our son swam here for the Junior Olympic age group meet. At first I thought the facility might be a little small for such a large event but it ended up being just fine. The starting blocks are SO much better than the last meet. Having the event and heat easily visible from the practice pool is a really nice feature and makes it easy for the kids to know when they need to get out of the pool so they don't miss their races.<//Review><rate>5</rate></record></dataset><record>

Grwat aqua aerobics. Good instructors and love the scenery around  the pool and the deep water. Wish the classes were daily and year round daily for the dedicated people who rely on them . No other club in town offers this. Downside -- you pay per class not per day. Seems since as tax payers we already contribute  to the financial upkeep, they should offer an all day pass to those of us doing these classes. Just an idea.< /text>

Staff is very friendly and on top of rules and pool safety but unfortunately the food is sometimes not open and can be very overcrowded in certain areas. More seating would be cool and shaded areas. Unless you get there an hr early your looking at no where to sit unless you bring chairs.<//text>

They dont put enough chemicals in the water so I got sick and had cold sores. They also prevent you from diving into the water with goggles.< /review>

The class was approximately 45 minutes long it consisted of initial session of floating with floatation weights that you used in exercises we did various exercises and three groups of 30, 20 and 10 second intervals on that actually got your heart rate moving pretty well and then moved to the wall for additional set doing 60, 40 and 20 seconds for additional exercises for about the other half of the class. We had a nice warm up and cool down afterwards, little bit of music in the background very fun experience very sociable group.</text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x808517e043f00913:0xb71d98d8e635d67</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Good pools for year round lap swim. During summer it's open for rec swim and features a water slide! Parking is plentiful and the locker rooms are well maintained.</text>

The waiter was great, very entertaining and knew the menu well. He looked liked the only one though and seemed very busy. The food was good, not great but good. I enjoyed the meal and atmosphere, I had a pleasant experience.< /Review>

<Review>This place is very good they have very good gluten-free pasta also but everything on their menu looks good if you are a cannoli freak like me the cannolis are very good also the homemade pasta is definitely worth it</Review>< pictures>

<Text>Excellent Italian and seafood.  Bonus points since they took a reservation for 11 an hour before seating.  Service was excellent.  Reasonably priced wines.  Average per person with table appetizers and desserts was about $40 per person not including alcohol.  Would visit this eatery again next time I'm in the area.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

5 stars for the happy hour experience. $1 oysters were solid, good deals on drinks ($6 glass of wine, $5 for beers), had a couple other small dishes that hit the spot. Great place to kick off an evening in Carlsbad. Dinner looked pricey but might try in the future.<//Text>

<Review>First of all, the service here was really wonderful, and the environment/decor is really welcoming and clean. They were willing to take our reservation last minute for a party of like 12 of us which was phenomenal. I'm going to sound a little like a Karen here though so bear with me; however, the food was kind of bland, especially for what you pay for it. It took almost an hour and a half to get food to the table which was ridiculous. I literally forgot we had already ordered. The portions were also off for what we ordered- some plates that should've been smaller were massive, and vice versa. Wine and alcohol selection were fantastic and decently priced. But it was just kind of "meh," food wise. I will say that the lemoncello cake was delicious though and definitely my favorite thing had for the night.<//Review>< pictures>

Happy hour foods are surprisingly delicious. The 1$ oysters are OK, I wouldn't say they are the best I've ever had, but no prolonged trips to the John afterwards confirms them harvested fresh.

Drinks are delicious! I recommend the espresso one.<//text>

<Review>AMAZING FOOD & Sal was awesome - great manager super nice and also got us in in a good amount of time on a Friday, and we were able to be safe and maintain social distancing while enjoying delicious I mean DELICIOUS food.  Carlsbad is great and I want to live down the street now because this restaurant & their staff is just that good.  The Marsala and the other chicken dish with white wine sauce is to die for.  Everything was fantastic.   Also the town is cool too.  Thanks for a great experience!<//Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Great local Italain joint in the heart of the Carlsbad Village.  They have regular Groupon deals and happy hour daily from 4-6pm.  $1 oysters and great appetizer deals.  Only wish they scrubbed the sidewalk on the outdoor patio.  But during covid times, beggars can't be choosers.</Review>

< Review>
A traditional Italian menu set in a modern space. You can tell the love and care put into each dish and the warning on the menu speaks volumes to ensuring they don't sacrifice the quality by saying if it is busy orders can take up to 40 minutes as everything is made from scratch. If you can't afford to take some time to appreciate the care they put in then come early or come later in the evening.

And while the food is fantastic, the hospitality is equally attentive. This night due to a glitch one order did not come the same time as the rest of our dishes. The service recovery was beyond excellent as they gave the kids a little treat to make up for it. This was on top of attending to a wobbly table and constantly coming by to ensure we were always topped up with bread or ensuring we were done with our dishes.

The restaurant was very nice but a bit loud though. The service was very good. I had scallops that seemed OK, very tender...very sandy. However after I got home, I began getting sick to my stomach. I was sick 11 hours after eating there as I write this post. I'd stay away from the scallops if I were you!</Text>

They also have the best SDRW menu in town and happy hour. The tomato sauce that came with the bread was amazing. The bread was okay- regular white bread. For appetizers we got their meatballs and the ravioli dish, both were really good. For entrees we got the ossobuco and fettuccine with shrimp and scallops. The ossobuco was good but the risotto wasn’t rich and creamy. The pasta dish was good. For desserts we got the tiramisu and soufflé. Soufflé was amazing. Tiramisu not so much. Knock a star down for our nonexistent service. Service 1 star. It took forever for everything. They were busy but we watched other tables who came in after us served and paid their bill before we got even our entrees. Server never came around for anything. Not sure if it was where we sat, but it took 30 minutes for entrees to come out, and then 20 minutes for the bill. But from reading other reviews, it looks like it was the same server who everyone complains about. Probably be better to sit at the bar for some service.< /Review>< gmapID>

The sausage/mushroom pasta dish was savory but I regret not ordering a seafood dish. That is what they're best at. Oh well, still satisfied, oh and they have a grilled portabella mushroom it is really good.< /review>

Great food and a nice place to sit outside in good weather. The prices are on the high end so look at the menu before you show up. If you are willing to pay the prices you will not be disappointed by the food. The servers were also all very nice and tentative.<//text>

First of all the chairs and tables are so uncomfortable. After we ordered our food we were waiting for over an hour for just a pizza and lasagna and when we finally got our pizza it was burnt but the server didn’t even mention anything until we finally mentioned it to him at the end and he did not offer any discount. At the end we had wait half an hour for the server to come to our table just to pay him. The food was too cheesy and salty. Overall it wasn’t a pleasant experience. Would not recommend it at all.</text>

If you want authentic Italian food, in a friendly environment with outdoor/sidewalk seating, look no further. Sal and the staff make you feel at home. The food, oh the sauce...is absolutely amazing. Pasta is cooked to perfection and everything is fresh and flavorful. We've eaten Italian in Italy, New York and home cooked and Cicciotti's is on par with the quality, ambiance and service at some of the best restaurants around the world. Bravo!</Review>

<text>Look I get that it’s hard times all around, but I don’t understand why this restaurant would not honor a gift card I received for my birthday. They told me that they “don’t honor promotions for take out.” A gift card is not a promotion, and, where I come from, taking someone’s money for nothing in return is called stealing.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

We just had the most amazing Italian dinner . The seafood was fresh!!! The pasta homemade!!! The vodka sauce was delicate and refined! The delicious calzone with added garlic, sausage and made to order was huge!!! And the wine was delightful ! But most of all the service was beyond expectations! They were kind, fun , welcoming and made us want to visit again and again !!! Thank you for a memorable night!</review>

<Review>I went here for lunch during restaurant week and chose from their condensed menu - $10 for an entree and dessert with a wine pairing (3 varieties) for an additional $12. For what we paid, the food was good and portions were just right. Service was friendly and attentive. I'd definitely go back, but I'm not sure that paying full price would be worth it.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80dc721aaebe8f3b:0x6389f7ebc6b8e29d< /Gmap_id>< Date>

COVID-19 takeout experience VERY DISAPPOINTING and was worse than a third rate fast food joint. Called in to order on Thursday and was placed on hold for 8 minutes. The order included a Caesar salad, and I asked for extra dressing, which was acknowledged. During review of the order he didn't mention it so I asked again, which he confirmed. Then when I arrived to pick up my order he had to go back to the kitchen to get it, and I reminded him a third time and he said, "Sure. No problem." So why was there only a small 1 oz container of dressing? NO FOLLOW THROUGH sucks when I spent $75.00 on an order. During a time when restaurants are trying to survive they must be better than this. In the scheme of life dressing isn't a big deal, but I'm not sure I'll go back to Cicciotti's even if it reopens to sit down dining.<//Review>

<Review>Slow service. Bad food. High prices. I ordered the Lobster and Shrimp Ravioli and there was only one small shrimp on the plate and no lobster in the ravioli. Apparently it was a lobster sauce. My wife's pasta was bad as well.</Review>< Pictures>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>I was exploring Carlsbad Village during my birthday visit and stumbled across Cicciotti's. I had not read any prior reviews so I had no idea what I was in for. I was greeted and seated immediately as it was relatively early in the evening. The atmosphere was cozy and I was quite comfortable. I ordered one of the pasta/seafood specials and a glass of wine. The dish included shrimp, scallops the size of golf balls and a large lobster tail. It was absolutely delicious. Most places fill the plate with pasta and are stingy with the seafood -- that was NOT the case here. I loved my meal. Admittedly, it was a bit pricey but it was my birthday and I felt I should splurge.< /Text>< pictures>

<text>It's a smallish place and too cold to sit outside so we started out evening at the bar. The drinks were good and the bar staff were attentive and helpful. Our waitress was great too - she accommodated a special request from one of my friends, was friendly and made us feel like no request was unwelcome. The food was really good too. We'll definitely go back.<//text>< Gmap_id>

I love this place. The staff is so welcoming and the food is always excellent. They make their own pasta. Happy hour is fabulous with great drink prices, $1 oysters and lots of small plates to choose from.Excellent food and service inn the heart of downtown Carlbad. You can walk to the beach from here. Go on a Wednesday for lunch and then go to the Farmer's Market from 3 - 7:00 PM.< /text>

<text>Went there for first time,on friends recommdation. Service was slow, waitress
rude, and unaccomadating when I asked question, or for refill, took 40minutes to get order, and,when it arrived just thrown down on table in front of me abd,was cold and tasteless, must of been sitting under gear light to long, I have been to Italy and this is not real Italian food, I've had better at tasting pasta at Danny's.  needless to say I will be back to Cicciottis again and I don't take recommaditions from friends anymore.
If you want good Italian food,go anywhere but Cicciottis.</text>< username>

<Text>We ordered 2 meals, cheese Ravioli and chicken Alfredo. The cheese ravioli was okay but not worth its price value, there was only 5 pieces of ravioli in a $15 meal. With the chicken Alfredo, can I just say the worst Alfredo sauce in the WORLD!! It was NOTHING but whipping cream, no joke! All runny, not made with parmesan cheese or any cheese at all. The chicken looked like something you would buy out of a can. Just awful!!! Also when I called to place my order to go, I was hung up on by an Italian guy. Someone also hung up on my daughter 3 times before I called.</Text><pics>None</pics><UserId.>110888450914893992765<//UserId.>< GmapID>

Only giving 2 stars for the waiter Ray.
Other than that the food was a horrible example of authentic Italian food.
Gnocchi was mushy  and not fresh and pesto sauce had too much cream. Meatballs were too soft and smelled like dog food with no real flavor. Fettuccine alfredo was too watery, not creamy and not fresh as well.
Table bread was disgusting,  crumbly and not fresh.
Overall really disappointed by the food  will not be returning.
Chef should be embarrassed that this is the food he puts out.

<Rate>1</Rate><review>Sad it was a total fail. Embarrassing because we brought out of state guests. We went to Vintanas for restaurant week & it was excellent, service, food, etc. Here, it took over an hour to get our food, server didn't come back during that time. Food must have been sitting for awhile because it wasn't hot when served but we were all starving and knew it would take too long to get hot food. Server forgot my wine, asked him for it when I got my food which was now over an hour, he brought it after I finished my food, by then it didn't matter, we just wanted to leave. Our friends asked about the differences between a couple dishes, he explained so they opted for the $25 a la carte opposed to the $20 from restaurant week because of the difference only to find out there wasn't any difference, it was more expensive without the appetizer or dessert. The server never apologized for not coming back until food was being served, taking so long, that it wasn't hot, then while we were waiting for dessert, he came back with our check and made sure we paid before dessert was served. One of our friends went & talked to the mgr before we were served dinner & told him we had been there for an hour and a half to look at when we checked in & apologized but service still ended bad. This was disappointing, but happy there are plenty of great Italian restaurants like Vigglucci's that we will stick with. I had been wanting to try this place for sometime and I can check it off forever. Thank you for a memorable evening, it's been many years since we have had such a bad experience.</review>< user_name>

Great menu, lots to different Italian dishes to choose from, delicious bread with italian dipping sauce is brought out to munch on while you wait for your food. Nice inside/outside seating available, large wine selection. Great spot off the main road along the beach. Random parking lots (we found a free one right across the street from he restaurant) nearby and street parking around as well. Just a couple blocks from the beach area with lots of other shops and restaurants around as well.</text>

Terrible food at a high price point with mediocre service. No idea how this place has a 4.3 star rating.
The best thing about this place is it's location. In fact, that might be the only good thing about this place.
To be fair, the guy who greeted us and showed us to our table was very friendly.
Unfortunately, he was not our waiter and we never saw him again.
Our "service," if you can call it that, was taken over by a woman who  was extremely direct, unfriendly, and lacked any kind of warmth or personable qualities.
It's okay if you hate people, lady, but maybe choose a different profession.

She-who-hates-people-and-should-not-be-waiting-tables came to take our order 20 minutes after we sat down.
She brought, hands down, the most awful bread I have ever been served in a restaurant.
It literally tastes like it was made with 1950's Bisquick mix: kinda crumbly in the middle with a weak, somewhat dampish "crust."
This was served with an oily canned tomato concoction with some basil and garlic mixed in. Somehow this failed to disguise the depressing quality and bitter disappointment of the bisquick bread.
What kind of Authentic Italian restaurant serves Bisquick bread?!!!
Do they even have Bisquick in Italy?
Next I made the horrific mistake of ordering the Gorgonzola and Smoked Salmon Bruschetta, not thinking for a moment that it would be served on, you guessed it, Bisquick bread!
For $15.50 you too can have the most unimaginably anemic smear of watery Gorgonzola under a bit of store bought smoked salmon on top of bisquick bread. Step right up!
The mixed green with beet salad was borderline fresh. The greens weren't rotten, but they weren't winning any awards for perkiness. Maybe they wilted in the presence of our fair host. I'm pretty sure the beets came out of a can and the rasberry dressing was most likely costco brand. Not very good.
My recommendation: order this salad with no greens, no dressing, and no beets.
Just ask for a bowl of candied walnuts and save yourself the disappointment.
Next came the Gorgonzola Gnocci which, by comparison to the rest of the meal, didn't completely suck, though, the low quality of the rest of meal did lend itself to skepticism about whether the Gnocci and it's respective sauce also came from the freezer section at costco.
We were too terrified of further disappointment to order dessert.
Overall, the best part of this entire experience was leaving knowing we never have to repeat this experience again.
There are so many fantastic restaurants in Carlsbad. This is not one of them.</text>

Ate here one evening when in town on business. Were lucky to get a table for two, I'd recommend booking ahead if planning to eat at a peak time. A quiet but enjoyable atmosphere and very well prepared food made it a good evening. Will try again next time I'm in town too try more of the menu, maybe boat to 5 ✨ then. There was a good stray trade for take out pizza so clearly a popular place.<//Text>

The veal marsala was super soft and the gravy was superb. Dinner includes some aldente spaghetti  and vegetables in house sauce. Yummy! Had chocolate lava cake and terimiso for desert. Was very tasty.  Red wine lovers, try the  Nero from Sicily.  Vey smooth and full of flavor. The food takes extra time because everything is made so fresh.  Well worth the wait.< /Review>< Rating>

We had an outdoor table on a cool night and looked forward to a pleasant dinner.  The service was good but several food issues: although the tomato spread was delicious the appetizer bread served with it was a low quality white bread.  My wife said her add-on lobster was “mushy” and it was, like it had been frozen too long, pressure cooked and had a mashed potatoes texture.  My veal lacked flavor and seemed to have been thawed also.  We asked for a dessert menu and were brought the check.  Disappointing for $90 meal for two.<//Text>

<review>I drive in from Phoenix, checked into my hotel and went for a walk to find something good for lunch. I'm so happy that i choose Cicciotti! I got the linguine and clams. Very reasonably priced on the lunch menu and still a big portion. Edoardo was working the bar and serving tables and the place was pretty busy for one person. But he was on top of everything. He got my food quickly, plenty of refills and a great recommendation. Also extremely friendly. I've been to Italy once before and this experience felt very authentic, as well as the food tasted authentic. Try it out.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

My wife and I love the food at Cicciotti's in Carlsbad, so I took her there for her birthday this evening. Our server (also the hostess?) was a tall, thin lady. We had to wait nearly a half hour to get some bread once we were seated (while everyone that came in after us was given some), then quite a while again after our appetizer was delivered before we were able to give her our order for dinner. I mentioned to her it was my wife's birthday. We didn't see her again after that for nearly another hour, until she brought the bill. Others brought our food to us and checked on us. For my wife's birthday, she was served a bowl of vanilla ice cream that was almost completely melted, which was an insult, especially considering our tab was over $175.00. The surprisingly poor service ruined our birthday dining experience. We cannot help thinking we were being pre-judged or punished somehow, but have no idea why that would be.< /Text>

Our first full day in Carlsbad and we're still getting acquainted, so asked a very charming breakfast server at Denny's for a recommendation for an Italian Seafood place for that evening — it was Cicciotti's Trattoria & Seafood (though, we had to look it up on TripAdvisor for the spelling of the name and description just to be sure). Cicciotti's is very modern looking with both sidewalk dining, a patio and an inside dining area that's comfortable and relaxed. A small center bar area has 5 large TV screens that can be viewed from tables also. They have a Happy Hour with $1 oysters and reduced prices on drinks. Alex, our server was right there to seat us, got fresh baked bread to us with a chopped tomato biscetta-like topping to go with it.</text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><review>I'm not the best critic of Italian food considering it's not my preferred cuisine, but I would not hesitate to recommend Ciciiottis to anyone in the Carlsbad area. The ambiance is great due to the large rising door that creates an open environment. Food was good but l can't say I would order my particular dish again. Other dishes I sampled were better, and most were pleased with their orders.

We had a large party, and although there was a mistake with the food ticket, the manager and owner came out to apologize and made things right. It was a nice gesture that made the overall experience a 4 star rather than a 1.< /review>< gmapID>

<text>We usually love to come here at least once a month or so, but this visit was not up to the spectacular standards they usually perform at. Our server whom I think was the manager on duty was not as friendly as we have become accustomed to, I felt very hurried and like we were bothering him. I usually order a bottle of wine but I am very glad I did not this time simply because we were so rushed. The bread tonight was very stale like it had been sitting over night, the tomato bruschetta is usually phenomenal however tonight it was stringy and tasteless. Our food was prepared acceptably but my gnocchi looked well, sad. A few Walnuts were thrown haphasardly on top and whatever herbal garnish is usually present was mixed in. I brought my sister in law here because usually it is the best Italian food in town. Next when my sister comes to visit I may bring her somewhere else to spoil her.< /text><gmap_id>0x80dc721aaebe8f3b:0x6389f7ebc6b8e29d< /gmap_id>< Resp>

First we were handed over from waiter to waiter to waiter (yes, 3 times), then we had to ask 3 times if they could please turn on the outdoor heater, the waters we ordered were empty for while before they were refilled and we waited 45-50 min for our ordered food. 3 other tables that came after us received their food prior to us......not sure if that had to do with the fact that we are 2 mixed families (caucasian-black & caucasian-hispanic) or just with extre bad level of organization within the service of this restaurant itself, but we certainly had waited enough and left without anything to eat....!

If there were a Mt Rushmore for trattorias in SD county, Cicciotti's would be on it. Authentic food and genuine hospitality. Can't wait to return.<//Review>

Knocked my socks off!!! Edwardo our waiter was wonderful. The food just amazing. The roasted tomatoes on baggette bread was amazing. Anyone that doesn't rate this place a 5 should have there heads checked. Went to the one in Carlsbad. Going to Cardiff next time. Can't wait!!< /review>

Probably the worst attempt at a seafood "risotto"  i have had the misfortune of trying to digest and the cost..... should be ashamed to call that soup with rubberized calamari anything but inedible.
I have a trained monkey that doesn't see so well and unfortunately, one arm that could have served up a better dish. And why the hell does this stupid rate and review only allow postings if you have at least one star?? That would suggest that there was something good about this experience..... THERE WASN'T</Text>

<Text>Its hard to believe we have such a beautiful contemporary Italian restaurant with such perfect food here in Carlsbad - no need to go to Encinitas/Cardiff, etc.  Great friendly staff, followed by outdoor coffee at Succulent Cafe - a perfect day.  Two new places run by nice folks that everyone should support.  Thank you so much for improving our town.< /Text>< Pictures>

Bland dishes and poor value were the bad.  Ambiance, location, service were fine.  There's a lot of Italian restaurants in Carlsbad, this would not be one of the Village's top in terms of taste (i.e. Fresco, Vigalucci's or Calle Pomodoro).  If there's a next time, we'll look at meat dishes or regular pasta.<//Text>

<review>The bread and tomatos as we sat down was a nice touch.  The bread baked fresh.  We started with an order of Calamari.  It was breaded and fried very lightly.  Not greasy at all.  I had The Veal Parmigian.  A large veal loin baked to perfection.  Fresh spaghetti and vegetables on the side.  Delicious.  Fabian, took great care of us!< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Good Italian food at relatively reasonable prices. Can be uneven though, with overdone chicken breast on a recent visit. Management and staff are eager to please and service is excellent, even at busy times. Happy hour is a bargain for drinks and appetizers.<//Review>

I love a crunchy crust on a pizza... so, if you do too? Go somewhere else. Also, Lasagna al Mare says crab... should be spelled Krab, for $26.50?! Really? Bread, cold...served with cold tomatoes, gross. Server? Excellent! That's why 3 stars.< /Text>

If you want a great Italian meal this is the place for you. The lasagna I had was by far the best ever. The service was excellent and sitting outdoors watching the walking traffic added to the experience. A definite 5 star.</Review>

The food took 1 hour and 20 mins.
My Calzone was like a flat pancake a little mozzarella cheese  and pepperoni.  No peppers or mushroom or even onions
Very sad.<//text>

<Rating>3< /Rating><text>The good: we ordered Linguini Vongole and Fettucini Alfredo. Both the bread and the food was delicious.

The bad: I asked for Extra Garlic on the Linguini Vongole. They charged an additional $1.50 for the Extra Garlice!

The bad: We were there on a Thursday, arrived at appx 4pm. I had noticed online that they had happy hour so we arrived in time to catch the happy hour. Upon arrival, the hostess asked if we wanted to sit in the bar or in the restaurant. We said; in the restaurant. She never mentioned that they had Happy Hour specials and that we would have to sit in the bar to take advantage of the Happy Hour specials. After we had ordered our wine and dinner, I asked; don't you have Happy Hour specials? The waitress said; "Only in the bar". I later asked; "we ordered the House Wine, and didn't know we had to sit in the bar to enjoy the Happy Hour pricing; would you perhaps be so kind, to honor the Happy Hour pricing for your wine? She said: no, can't do it. She said she can't enter it in to the computer.

It is unfortunate and it is a shame. We are local to Carlsbad/San Marcos. This was the first time we tried this restaurant. We really liked the food and we would have returned many times for meals at this restaurant. However, that they charge $1.50 for extra garlic is absurd. And that she wouldn't honor the happy hour price for the wine is Not good customer service. We didn't order any expensive wine; we ordered the house wine. She really could have mentioned that they had Happy Hour specials only in the bar.

Honestly, it didn't feel as if she cared if we ever came back. She didn't make us feel as if she appreciated our business.

We would have liked to make this restaurant our new favorite local Italian Restaurant. We also would have liked to recommend it to all our friends and business associates. It is a shame. We will not be going back and we will make sure to inform our local friends about our experience<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>What was supposed to be a simple evening of Italian food and a few drinks quickly became an experience to remember for all the wrong reasons. It all started quite well honestly, the two of us were walk-ins after the dinner rush around 2000 (8pm). We were sat at a small table, good atmosphere and what started as a very promising dining experience began; oh how wrong we were!
It began with waters and bread, no complaints there (perhaps the only thing that went right). We promptly ordered drinks and one of the calamari appetizers. Simple enough one would think... Our drinks arrived about ten minutes later and we ordered our meals. One Moscow Mule and one Margarita. The Moscow Mule was terrible, it was made with Gin... a Moscow Mule with gin... really? You’d think as it’s offered as a special the bar staff would have had it mastered, apparently that was too much to ask. The margarita was good so perhaps a win for the bartender there, until I reordered.... it was in a tall glass with three extra limes in what I’m assuming was filler to ensure the liquid met the brim of the glass. It also tasted heavily diluted the second time and not the same color as the first one. Class act.
At this point the main course came out. Yes, before the calamari. We notified the staff that we would no longer like the calamari which they were somewhat understanding of. Somewhat. Our very young looking male server had an attitude when we addressed it with him. Then proceed to not come back to the table until 30 minutes after we were obviously done with our meals, plates cleared and we were trying to get is attention (without bothering other guests).
Overall as a new resident of the area I would strongly recommended you seek another restaurant to have your evening out at. As someone who comes from a background in the food and beverage industry, I would be embarrassed if this were to happen in an establishment where I worked or represented. Again, foodies seek other eateries around town, not worth the time or money. Owner, consider new management, the manager appeared to be spending the majority of his time at a barstool rather than tending to the restaurant.
(Note: my picture of the two margaritas don’t seem to be posting but it’s almost comical how off they are.)< /Review>< Pics>

< Review>
It was ok.... The salad we ordered was less than ok. The mandarin oranges were so old they were fermented. The salad was smothered in cheap balsamic vinegar glaze. The portobello mushrooms were marinated in the same glaze and their flavor was completely overpowered by the glaze. Honestly, this was nothing like real Italian food which when cooked correctly uses very fresh ingredients and very high quality oils and vinegar and used them sparingly enough that flavors are enhanced and balanced. The tables and chairs were uncomfortable and not clean.  I will not return to this restaurant.<//Review>

Horrible service! The waitress was complaining the whole time and treated us like we were idiots and the manager was a jerk. If you have an Arizona drivers liscense don't even think about going here because they won't accept it! Worst dining experience I have ever had.< /text>

I ordered a pepperoni pizza and it was the WORST pizza ever. It had no flavor, the pepperoni was almost tasteless and the crust tasted like saltine crackers. What a waste of money! I'll never eat there again.</Text>

Delicious food! Started with warm bread and chilled homemade marinara for dipping (chunks of tomato, seasoned with basil, garlic vinegar and olive oil) then graduated to the pappardelle pasta with lobster cream sauce, shrimp and diver scallops (with red bell pepper and zucchini for added color and flavor).  You can get this dish anytime, even if it's not actually on the menu at the time of your visit (it's that popular). I added a fresh 5 oz lobster tail and wasn't disappointed! My husband had the seafood lasagne (crab, seabass, salmon) which was a big hit as well and ordered two glasses of wine. We didn't order dessert and I just drank water but the bill was over $100 so it's not a place I would go on a regular basis but for a special occasion it's a great option.</Review>

<Text>I cannot understand why people rant and rave about this place.  It's okay, but certainly nothing special.  Perhaps those doing the rating and raving haven't been anywhere else?

My wife and I like the joint for a place to have a glass of wine on the patio near the sidewalk.  We find that the wait staff is very nice and very good.

The food?  For us that's another story.  We find it to be mediocre at best.  On the evening of 12/08/17, we ordered fettuccine alfredo with crab meat.  Remember the Wendy's commercial from years ago which exclaimed, "Where's the beef?"  After dining at Ciocotti's, our question is, "Where's the crab?"  This is not to say that the fettuccine was devoid of crab.  Believe it or not, there were actually some bits and pieces of crab mixed in.  We had to use a magnifying glass to find them, but they were there.

I understand that dining out is expensive and that Ciocotti's is not bashful in presenting you with a three digit bill.  But, for goodness sake, if you are going to charge a premium price for a few noodles with alfredo sauce and microscopic pieces of crab, at least include a hefty portion of crab not unlike that which you get at Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco.

Bottom line?  We will return to Ciocotti's for a glass of wine or two, but don't bother to bring us the food menu.</Text>< Pics>

Cicciotti's has always been our favorite spot for Italian food. This location isn't as nice as the original in Cardiff location. It's super small and cramped, the staff isn't as friendly and the overall feel isn't as nice. We love our Cicciotti's but will not be going back to this location.< /Text>

<review>Nice restaurant, food was good. They offer in and outside dining. Not sure if they were short staff when we were there  no one came to ask how we were doing or if we needed refills on our drinks, there was a family dining as well and never saw staff asking them either. Over all food was good.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Upsides: Wide variety of fibers, texture, colors, and size. There were also books, needles, and lost wool to make your own yarn (thats what I think it was) Downsides: There were no baskets (that I knew of) to put the yarns in and took a while to check out because there was only an ipad.< /review>< pictures>

When traveling to new places it’s very important to make sure that there is a great yarn store that you can explore. ImagiKnit has a great selection of everything you’ll need to knitting, crocheting and weaving! They also have a great staff to help with whatever project you might be interested in creating!<//text>

I love this store. I absolutely loose my marbles trying to decide what to get. Even when I go in with something in mind already. The yarn displays, example swatchies and  model knits, makes you want to knit/crochet 300 different things at once. And the staff at the store are so very nice and helpful.<//Text>

Love this San Francisco iconic yarn store.
Absolutely packed to the brim with an amazing selection of yarns, I could easily spend 2 hours just working on colourscapes for future projects.
The library is very well stocked with books well beyond patterns.
Many notions available and some unusual pieces I had been looking for.
The staff were incredibly helpful and went out of their way to ensure I got exactly what I needed for my project.
Regular classes available as well as fun knit alongs. Keep your eyes out as many celebrity knitters have been known to stop by.< /text>

Super friendly and helpful staff! Wonderful selection. Felt like visiting old friends who are the kindest hosts in their cozy home. Found the perfect llama wool for a repair and the right size needles for turning the rest of the skein into a hat.</review>

<Review>I used to love this place and came every week to get a big batch of yarns and items for any project I could think of. After I moved farther away I went 6-8 months without going there and had a few beautiful yarns that I did not need anymore with the packaging and tags still on. They would not return or anything for it. After even talking to them for awhile asking them that these yarn are just going to waste and are still being sold in store please do something with them, be sustainable. Alas they did not and now it's going to go to waste especially for a costumer that went weekly for a year. I was so dissappointed with them and could now believe that they would do that. If you are going to go here just know the costumer service is not great at all unless they see you will buy a lot from them.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< rate>

Their yarn selection is extremely diverse; a myriad of fibers, gauges, colors.  The needle and notions section is fairly large.  If you are unsure of what project you'd like to work on, you're sure to walk out having found something.  The owner and staff are really helpful.< /text>

I just want to skip around in here and spend a fall afternoon learn how to knit socks. This is the kind of place that makes me want to have a knitting + tea party. The walls are covered with yarn, yearning to be spun into something adorable (or if I make it, barely passable).</Review>

This is the place to go if you're looking for a large selection! A little overwhelming at first, but once you figure out how its organized (first room is wools, and the other is acrylics, cottons, silks, linens, etc) then it becomes easier to find what you want. It's great that you can find the normal stuff that most yarn shops carry in addition to things that many yarn shops don't. Very easy to find something unique (esp if you're visiting from elsewhere). Wasn't super impressed with the customer service, but did like that I wasn't bugged by everyone. Overall a good experience, just wish the staff was a little friendlier and more welcoming.</text>

<Review>Great yarns sold in an unfriendly atmosphere. Even on a slow day the staff seems frazzled. The owner made fun of my friend's accent as we were buying $80 worth of yarn. She has 2 dogs and one of them leapt on my lap after I sat down to look at a pattern book. I don't mind but that means they live on this couch. Not sure if the place smells moldy because of the dogs or if it's something else.< /Review>< pictures>

An adorable little shop in the Castro district of SF, which means: Men working in a knitting store! The people here are so sweet and helpful. I really didn't need any more yarn, but dang it, they had a bunch of cool knitting/project bags and totes that called my name. But if I were looking for yarn, there are skeins and skeins of drool-worthy fibers packed in cubbies from floor to ceiling, and they're arranged by weight, going in a counterclockwise direction throughout the store. So you start with your lace weight when you walk in the door and end with the bulky weights at the end. There's also a selection of knitting tools as well as knitting-related impulse items to wring the $$ out of any self-respecting knitter. They offer classes here too so it's a full-service knitting store. Whether you're just thinking of getting into knitting or are an expert, you'll find something here to intrigue you. Oh, and they let me use their bathroom--double plus good!</Text>

Nice shop with a great selection with friendly staff who let me shop on my own when I said I was just looking.
The yarn is displayed beautifully from floor to ceiling.</review>

< review>
I just started to learn to knit and wanted to check out a yarn store in the neighborhood and could help me pick out the right yarn and tools for a fingerless glove project.
The people at the store were very helpful in explaining the outlay of their yarn collection and were so excited for me and my project using a specific yarn.  Little did I know
that even for yarn, you can end up finding something organic and cruelty-free and made locally in Sonoma or someplace.  If I weren't buying yarn, I think I would have thought I was buying
organic meat for cooking. Not sure I would buy everything here since there are cheaper places and I'm not sure they have an exchange policy, but it's a good start for a newbie knitter.</review>

<Text>Great selection, but I won't go back.
Staff was void of customer service.
The cashier was rude to the customer ahead of me, but fine towards me.
Floor staff recommended 1 type of yarn and when I asked what something similar in a bulky or heavier weight would be she responded , " well this is the only yarn we recommend for beginners, the rest (heavier weight) is on this wall."
I've worked in the textile industry for 4 years.
I could buy any of that wholesale, and in the future, I will. Completely disappointed at my attempt to patronize local business here.<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>Warning.
I bought two pairs of circular needles from them a few weeks ago, my first time in this store. After I started my project I realized one pair was too large. I went to the store today to exchange for a smaller size and was told they do not exchange. I did not asks for a refund, only an exchange. The needles were in there original plastic baggie that had never even been opened. The saleswoman was very blunt.
What an unethical business.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x808f7e1a2fd41085:0xc67c5c1277043800< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Originally I bought my flash pass online but when I arrived to the rides they tell me it's only good for one person although online it stated that a party of 6 or less can use the same QR code. They need to specify that each person needs to pay for their own flash pass.</Review>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Review>it's very useful, especially if you know the park well. You can move quite efficiently. However the new watch device they use has a weak clasp and could come off if slightly bumped. If you lose it it's $100 so be careful.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONJ3JEM5zS_kzDvvUoBWaRq8FBBHLntpu8pcb5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQkYeqX-49ygliE5f6iqUhLUcnwrkSXfL50XCA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80c280a447476681:0xb09479a4ecd31875<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<rate>4< /rate><text>This six flags is amazing and fun. When I was a kid I was very scared and intimidated by this place. But as I grew up with my big sister and friends helping me slowly I started love going on roller coasters. I’m 14 and I’ve been on every ride . My favorites are Drop Of Doom, Superman, tatsu, Goliath and twisted colloid. All of these rides are really fun. The most thrilling ride in my opinion is drop of doom. The employees are nice and the park is decently clean. The lines are usually pretty fast but when the park is packed it’s pretty frustrating. The only complaint I have for this park is the food. The food here is expensive and garbage. The pizza is dripping with grease, the fries are soggy and cold, and the chicken tenders are dry and rock solid. I can’t find any food places here that are actually good. Not to mention the chop stix food taste like school food. Like come on, $18 for a plate of school food? Huge waste, this is why you should pack yourself your own lunch.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNv27DFTQ21UJ4MSsXR2dMVtcOz5Bq-2WtS11Tw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjs2bUemTkXaznarOcxx5jpd3agPSdLj63V0HI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

It wasn't a busy day but my son got to go on everything he wanted to. We bought the Flash Pass for the Christmas sale they had. A great deal for all of 2019. He will get plenty of use out of it.</review>

Great way to deal with the lines. It holds your place in line while u go to the restroom, ride a close by short line ride, or you can go to grab a snack mean while.Upgrade & cut 50 % of the wait time in line...better yet get the highest deal and cut 90% of the line! See u at Flash pass. Love you team member Esmeralda!</review>

Go with the gold pass! Ride the most popular rides without using the pass fist thing then later in the day ride them again using the pass. There are a few rides you can only ride once using the Fast Pass.<//Text>

Best thing you can get. Will not go to six flags without it!! Not having to wait in line is amazing! Went through all the rides in less than 4 hours and still had a lot more time to hang out. Best thing ever<//Text>

<review>Works if youre not the type to wait in line.  Real back door entrance type s#!+ (pause). Went on a friday b4 labor day and the park wasnt very busy.  If I hadn't pre purchased i I probably wouldn't have gotten them.  On flip side if the park is packed it is a great way to ride ALOT more< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<review>This is a most have if you have extra cash towards your Magic Mountain visit. Reserving your spots at the front of all the major roller coaster lines, was fantastic. A family of 4 cost a little coin, but it's worth it if you can.< /review>< Time>

I would give it a zero if I could! To expensive! Not worth the money. I’ll wait my two hours for the x2 than pay 200 for a flash pass for one person!</review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) The park is really cool and has the most extreme roller coasters ever seen, like the X2, but many attractions were closed. Even though it is a low season - and the park was actually quite empty, with queues of at most 5 minutes - you expect to find only one or two closed attraction and not as many as those that were closed .... If the park proposal is to work 365 days a year is expected to be fully operational.

(Original)
O parque é muito legal e tem as montanhas russas mais radicais já vistas, como a X2, mas muitas atrações estavam fechadas. Mesmo sendo baixa temporada - e o parque efetivamente estava bem vazio, com filas de no máximo 5 minutos - você espera encontrar apenas uma ou outra atração fechada e não tantas como as que se encontravam fechadas.... Se a proposta do parque é funcionar 365 dias ao ano espera-se que assim funcione plenamente.< /Review>

<Review>Walter was one of the best t mobile reps I’ve ever dealt with. His customer service was stellar and he was able to solve all of my issues which were complex. I would highly recommend him to anyone seeking help with t mobile issues. This guy is a genius and has lots of patience and customer care.

<text>Ivan, who helped my wife and me purchase new phones, was superb start to finish, including next day exchange for different model due to buyer’s remorse.    An associate, Damara, who initially received me on subsequent day of exchange, was terrible.  At first she asked for my receipt even though their printer was broken the day before.  Then said finding my emailed receipt was only way to recall transaction.  After searching my phone for a bit she then relented and asked what was my phone number.   To which she replied there was nothing showing in their system that I’d been there yesterday....fortunately Ivan arrived just then and took care of everything, proficiently and nicely—including not assessing a restocking fee to which Damara initially  said I would be subject.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<Review>Luis is a life saver!!!!!!! Had the worst weekend of tech nightmarish experience at Verizon, dealing with my phone suddenly not working. After spending 5 hours at the Verizon store with no solutions to my issue, I left furious and decided to change service. I went straight to T-Mobile, waited in the holiday line and was pleasantly surprised by the expertise, customer service and problem solving capabilities of Luis. I watched other customers being rude with the wait but both employees kept calm and reassured them they were working as fast and hard as they could. Luis worked some magic, and placed a speedy order for the newest iPhone which arrived an entire month before Verizon told me they could get it out to me. Thanks T-Mobile!! So far I am so pleased with my local store and service!!!!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

If there was an option for zero star. This is what this store deserves. Worst customer service. They don't help you rather than call 611.</review>

Sadly this place never measured up after multiple visits with problems with the phones. Is it turns out they are contractors, not real Sprint people, They're actually contractors. Solutions to problems at best was minimal. Better off going to a real Sprint store</text>

Awful is the best description I can use. Bought a new phone from Consuelo V. She seemed to know what she was doing....but discovered after spending 3 hours in the store she connected my new phone to my wife's number. Had my phone number connected to NO device! Only discovered when I started getting my wife's work calls. Took another 2 1/2 hours to fix the mess. Sprint stores and customer service is atrocious!!! Avoid this store at all costs!!< /review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>If you don't want your phone to break down  if you don't want to get internet  if you don't want your contacts are your call out to work  don't get Sprint these are the things that go wrong  oh okay. Now this store is the worst store ever I feel on this damn Planet let's see Sprint I thought Verizon was bad well Sprint is ten times worse and this is why let's see I have tried to hook up direct deposit where they take the money out of my account I've told him I sent a letter I've told him okay okay we got it every month the same thing they text me you are late they still have not gotten it or figured it out boy I think they have people working for them that have no brains I don't know what it is it's very frustrating and irritating anybody in their right mind would not go to Sprint. First I went down to the store and paid my bill then I waited in line which is very confusing on where the line was at there was no structure on at least when you go into Verizon there's somebody at the door to greet you this person is standing behind the counter and shouting out at different people on who was next very strange after I paid my bill I still try to make a phone call out I have not been able to make a phone call and seven whole days I've tried to call Sprint and my phone it died I tried to email them it would blink out and erase you know when my phone dies or I haven't made my payment in time it just goes straight to them but I couldn't even do that so I went down to the store. Waited another hour or so finally got a hold of one of the technicians there she really didn't ask who my name was see that box over there it's a big white box that is plugged into the wall that gets Wi-Fi Wherever You Are and I end up finding out you need a home phone to get that wireless which they did not even ask if I had one so I'm going to be getting this thing in the mail which I haven't gotten it yet and it's still not going to work no matter where I go because I don't have a home phone I only have a cell phone. I live in a motorhome which is on the road at all the time depending on what job I'm going to. Not only that I called two technicians just this weekend when a family member had a birthday and I still cannot call out after I left that store of course it worked perfect in the store until I left as I got away and then Wi-Fi went away my phone stopped working again do you know how frustrating that is I had to borrow another phone the call Sprint text Nishant and the lady told me I will give you $20 off your next bill that is not going to help me when I'm supposed to be paying Unlimited phone call and texting and she's only going to give me $20 for the seven days of frustration and no response from their store at all or or be able to get on the internet they are crazy they switched me to somebody else and Korea which to tell me he cannot help me until I'm in an area with Wi-Fi well no kidding they are the worst or ever if anybody has any brains don't go there I know I'm leaving .</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x808599d05be4a00f:0x9ce33ac12ea29449</Gmap_id></record>

<rate>5</rate><text>I don't understand how this Sprint store can get 1 star ratings. I have been to other Sprint locations (Novato) and have had the worst experience. That store made my account a complete disaster and every single employee there tells me something different.

I decided one day to try a different location (San Rafael) and had the greatest experience. Payman has helped me on various occasions. Every single time I walk in the store he takes his time, fixes whatever I need, and offers suggestions that I can truly trust. I never second guess that he has my best interest in mind. Just last weekend he stayed with me for hours to help me with my account and made sure everything was taken care of before leaving.

Payman and the rest of the employees at Sprint Montecito Plaza have been wonderful and I can't tell them how grateful I am for their hard work in fixing my account. I highly recommend this store over all others and can honestly say they are the reason I am still a Sprint customer.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
This is such an amazing chiropractic practice! All of the massage therapist know what they’re doing and are super friendly. The administrative staff is also very helpful and goes out of their way to accommodate. Dr.Nguyen really knows his stuff, and makes you feel really comfortable. I highly recommend! And I simply have to mention how clean and beautiful this place is. The massage beds are crispy and clean, and they warm up!< /Review>

Great place to go to relax, unwind, get realigned and massaged. They have a bunch of different spa options like heating rocks, heated bed, water massage table, and other cool stuff. This spa is also very beautifully decorated. Gloria at the front is super sweet and has friendly customer service. Thank you for what you do for all of us. I love coming here</text>

<Text>I came to this clinic after I got into a car accident with my family. They are very kid friendly and also have an awesome room just for kiddos with toys and TVs. I really enjoyed the adjustments and massages. They have nice caring staff and beautiful new office. Definitely recommend checking them out.</Text><rating>5<//rating><gmapID>0x809adf696382d13d:0x12eb0e1e5d30ba5f< /gmapID>< UserId.>

10/10 Recommended!
Staff here are super nice and caring! Nadia, Irina, and Gloria, made all of our visits great! I’m glad I heard about Kingdom Chiropractic & spa. I wouldn’t go to a different place, my friends got treated here as well and were highly satisfied with the services provided for them.< /Review>

A+++   NEW!
This place is Brand new and the best looking Chiro office I have seen. They offer a kids room with free salt room. The staff is super nice including Olga at the front desk. Don't let the outside fool you. Its amazing inside and the service matched.  The hand massage was fantastic!

Also they support local charity.Just another bonus on top of the great service and  amazing office they have.

<Review>One of the best offices I’ve ever been to! The front desk is so nice and helpful, especially Gloria, she was so helpful in explaining the different services they offer! She walked me through everything, pricing, what to expect afterwards too. The chiropractor Jason is so nice too, he really knows what he’s doing and how to help people in need. Highly recommend this clinic, you won’t regret it!< /Review>< pics>

Amazing place for Chriropractic Care & Massage. Very clean, new equipment, mazing service and very friendly staff. My wife and I went for several visits we loved it. Highly recommend to anyone who wants to improve their health by getting rid of pain. They even have a play room for the kids.< /review>

I visited this office after a car accident and they took really good care of me helping me find an attorney. This place is really nice, the staff is super friendly.

Kingdom Chiropractic is a super clean, nice, and professional establishment. They have great staff who take care of you, whether you're getting scheduled, adjusted, massaged, etc. My favorite was the spa area! It's sooo relaxing and a definite must try. I always feel better after coming here.<//Review>

I came to the Kingdom Chiropractic for a wellness care. I am very impressed with the clinic which is clean. The staff are very nice and professional.
I have neck and back pain for 1 year and had tried several chiropractors but I don't feel better. After I met with Dr Jason and he treated me with chiropractic adjustment. I feel better after his adjustment. He is knowledgable and very professional. This place is five stars.<//Review>

Really courteous and professional staff. The place just beams with excellence from the way the clinic looks to the treatment itself. I came in after a car accident because there was a lot of stiffness in my neck/shoulder area and the doctor did the alignment properly, I feel much better even just after the first appointment. The masseuse also did a great job and was considerate of all the affected points in my back. 10/10 would recommend.

P.S. The owner of the place is a really great & trustworthy guy and the staff that served me seem to have big respect for him.< /Text>

Kingdom Chiropractic has went above and beyond expectations. After a negative experience at a different chiropractic office, that quickly changed from my first visit here. Dr. Jason knows his profession well and is a really enjoyable and knowledgeable person to talk to. The massage beds with salt infused air are very neat and therapeutic as well.<//Review>

This is my favorite place to come to on weekly basis! The staff is very polite and always makes you feel welcome. I get my adjustments done by the doctor who always listens to my concerns and never rushes thru the adjustment. I highly recommend this office to anyone who would like a great experience and feel like a new person after the wellness visit:)</Text>

< Review>
Wow this place is beaming with excellence!! Excellent customer care at the front desk. Nadia was very kind,  took the time to answer all my questions to start my accident treatment case. Dr. Jason Nyeun is very experienced, easy to talk with and does the best adjustments. I already feel better after my first session. Highly recommend this place!!< /Review>

The office is beautiful and clean and the employees are all very nice and helpful. They took me in right away and make the process simple and fast. They gave me a massage right away which was amazing. I came with my daughter and they had a kids room That kept her busy. Can’t wait to come back and start my adjustments. They also gave me a gift bag with a gift card to Starbucks, chocolate and a mug.</Text>< Pics>

This was an amazing experience everyone is super friendly. They try to accommodate with your time. I am always eager to come back in for an adjustment and ooooo my massages were amazing! I was struggling to find a good attorney as well as a good auto shop for my car and they helped me! I would definitely come back here!<//text>

<Name>Diana Muzichuk< /Name><text>I went in for a whole package, and walked out extremely satisfied! Upon arrival I was met with the sweetest receptionist, Gloria. Then went in for a massage from a very experienced masseuse, Candy. She was so great and definitely helped relax my back. After that, I was led by Oksana to a salt room and wow I was impressed. The room had bricks in the walls with pink salt and a humidifier going while you lay on a heated stones. In the same room they had another back stretching mat. Oksana explained the benefits of everything so I felt informed of what I was being done to my body! Before visiting the doctor they put me on another bed to stimulate my lower back. I finished my visit with doctor Jason and he was great, put everything in place! This was a clean, safe and wonderfully staffed office, 10/10 would recommend!!</text></record>

I like supporting local establishments. I've tried other pizzerias in NoHo and only happened to see this particular place when I walked by a small strip mall on the corner of Lankershim and Hesby. I must say, I loved both their Supreme and Cheese Lovers pizza! Whatever secret recipe sauce they use was awesome! So far, Lenzini's has catapulted to my #1. I'll continue trying other pizzerias just because I like to explore and discover new places BUT this will be my go-to for now until a better pizza place comes along.</Text>

<Review>Lenzini's is probably the best pizzeria in the area of 10 mi I've been eating here for 10 years. The secret ingredient to lenzini's is they really care about making high quality pizza. And it's super affordable. The secret to eating at really good restaurants it's family run More family members the better the quality and service.</Review>< pics>

< Review>
Lenzini's has the best pizza I've ever had, globally.  Pizza, for me, is a staple experience food.  I have pizza in every country, state, and providence I visit at least once, usually two or three times, just to experience the variety of flavors and home town favorites.

I can say without a shadow of a doubt, Lenzini's is my favorite with every pie I've had from them.  I don't even know what it is that they do but they're pretty incredible.

Moreover, every single time I have a friend come from out of town, I make it a point to get pizza here and every single person ends up being shocked and falls in love with the pizza they have here.

So yeah, don't be a fool and pass up an opportunity for some incredible pizza if you're in the area, you would seriously be missing out.<//Review>

< Review>
In the beginning I thought this place was a jewel. I'm not going to lie the food is good. I was ordering from this place sometimes 5 days a week. On this particular night the driver or walker gets lost. I literally live around the corner. I was not offered a fresh meal. Was told that it was not a big deal he was out there wondering around with my food. I asked for some sort of compensation the "manager" ask me what would I like i tell him. After I asked him what can he do and he gets an attitude and basically ask me do you want the food or not. First of all no. Waste your food and lose a loyal customer. ✌< /Review>

Best pizza all around!! I'm so happy to have finally found a pizza place I really love. The pizza tastes amazing and is not greasy at all. I always get the thin crust. All my friends and family love Lenzini's as well. Highly recommended!<//review>

Small shop but quality! My family loves their lasagna and it comes with cheesy garlic bread for less than $10. Parking can be difficult as the lot is small and local can be crowded but worth a try. Check their website for online ordering!</review>

Hi, hope this isn't posted for everyone to see, but the night I went in, the store was dirty and had a bad smell. I ordered a thin crust online and it wasn't what I ordered, it was regular crust. The guy that helped me seemed unsure of himself and didn't communicate well. Sorry, I'm not trying to be harsh, and appreciate the fact as the owner you want to know what was wrong so that you can fix it. I hope this is useful information. Best regards, Mike<//Text>

Ordered here for the first time today, and were slated to deliver at 8:45pm, and arrived at 8:08pm. On a friday! Delicious, hot, amazing pizza. I'm not telling everyone to expect to get their food 40 mins early, just saying that this place totally earned their 5 stars this round for sure< /review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Ever since I tried their mushroom pizza on a thin crust with white sauce I am a regular customer! The pizza crust is the best part, crunchy and not greasy... The sandwich breads are good too. Yummy mozzarella sticks and potato sides. Very fresh lettuce in my favorite caesar salad…The delivery guys are very polite and quite on time though some weekend nights it takes a little longer to get the food but still you’ll get it hot and crunchy… reliable place to order food in advance for your gatherings and events…..no matter how many pizzas you ask for, always hot and delicious!</text></record></dataset><record>

On a budget this place can't be beat. This is not a posh dive bar. Its a pizza joint. If you want small portions and large prices go somewhere else. I get salad,pizza and hot wings for 2 under $20 bucks. Not bad for a Tuesday.<//review>

Great guys, great food. The lasagna really hits the spot. I eat here 3 or 4 times a week. Consistent quality, the meatball hoagie taste authentic like, New Jersey style.</Review>

Best pizza in North Hollywood

Update June 2018
Now that I've been coming here as a regular the quality of the pizza has dropped, the crust tastes old as well as the ingredients  it's just never been the same since I've been coming, sadly I will return and I'm really disappointed about that</Review>

<Review>I was working delivery for them. They dont wash there hands when working with the food.They dont wear gloves. The counter where they make the food is always dirty. The guy let me go becsuse he did not want to pay me for the hours i worked. Even though he said he would. Im just saying the facts they dont clean. They give a lot of food for the money because they dont clean they dont care.< /Review>< user>

<review>Your experience at this DMV will tend to be hit or miss. Mostly misses. I've come here a few times for various things and only had one very positive experience.

Since COVID, they emphasize booking an appointment before you come in. If you do, you can line up in the back on the left side. Don't make my mistake of waiting in the no-appointment line. The agent who takes your case is likely to be in a bad mood, so don't push your luck if they don't already seem happy. If you do, they'll besmirch you to the next person once you're a safe distance away 😂

Treat the agents with kindness and remember that this isn't a very forgiving place. If you're in a rush, come in on Mon-Thurs. Expect any Friday appointments to run between 1-2 hours.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<text>After being carefully screened outside first and as a walk-in with no appointment, it took me all of maybe 15 minutes to handle today's DMV business at this most reputable division. The social-distancing setup was excellent as you can see. The agent who assisted me was nothing short of totally friendly and efficient. I was home in less than hour - and that was on foot. This is the first time in my life I'd say the DMV needs a tip jar.<//text></record>

Wow, I am super impressed by this DMV's efficiency and customer service. This is the best one I have ever visited in 20 years. I came on a Tuesday morning at 10:30am. There were already 10 people waiting outside. I didn't have appointment and thought it would take me at least 2+ hours. But from arriving to finishing my driver license renewal process, it took just half an hour! The lady at window #10 was super nice and helpful. The gentleman at camera A was also kind and polite. Thank you for such a pleasant experience which is completely out of my expectation! :)<//text>

Fast and friendly service is not usually used to describe an experience at the DMV but they were efficient and organized. I highly recommend doing the prepaperwork through the DMV website before visiting to make your time filling paperwork at the counter smaller.

I appreciate the efforts made to ensure COVID-19 policies have been followed.<//review>

<Review>This office has really changed this around. I had issues with my registration and the manager, Simon, was very thorough, helpful and extremely understanding. I’ve never been treated so well at a DMV office. You can tell that he has this place trained and under control. If it wasn’t for the Sacramento office being so delayed and unresponsive, I would be giving this place a 5/5. Service was great from the three people I dealt with.

Although whoever takes license pictures was very rude.

Nonetheless, big thanks to Simon. I can see why he’s the manager of this location.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

I already have my permit and they said it was my fault they made a mistake because I didn't shove my permit in there face. They wasted my time and I missed my appointment slot. Then they had the audacity to tell me that for my next appointment I need to get there early so I don't miss it again. They wasted my time, got confused even though I told them multiple times what I was there for and then they were patronizing about the whole thing at the end.

During Covid, the experience was really nice here. You get a ticket outside and only need to go in when it is close to you (you can check your line status using the phone). And when you are in, staffs are friendly and quick.<//review>

The only good thing about COVID is that the DMV experience is now fantastic, at least at this San Mateo spot. If you do the paperwork online, you can walk right in and there's no line (on non-peak times).  I was In-N-Out in 15 mins, amazing experience.</review>

This is home base for me and I have never had any troubles with getting the help and support I needed in a timely manner. I'm very grateful and thankful to have the people I do in my corner helping me when it's critical and when it isn't. Everyone there are pretty much very decent people for the most part so I'm happy and proud to call this DMV my home base. Aside from SF DMV which is good too.<//review>

<UserId.>115273502127258618539<//UserId.><Review>In September, I was asked to do a secondary review of my documents and come back once the review is complete to get my learners permit. When I went today, the person checking me in told me to go back because I didn’t need to be there even though I had been asked to come back.
Instead of asking someone else the protocol on an application she’s not familiar with, she asked me to leave. If I had left, I wouldn’t have been able to get the permit or be able to book the behind the wheel test.

Overall the covid precautions outside were great and the check-in process was seamless.  I wish they had hand sanitizer inside the office so reminder to carry one yourself.</Review>< Resp>

Quite terrible(sigh)...Staff are uninformative and quite rude. Asked genuine question about how to renew registration during covid when their online system can't process our case online. Their response is yes or no. They don't teach/empower the visitors about their rules and requirement on simple tasks and yet make it so tedious. Sent me to a kiosk to answer my question that's not even on their location premise and the kiosk cannot take my renewal which brings me back to square 1. Thanks Dmv!</Text>

1.5 hours to enter at 1pm Wednesday 7/15/2020. Total 2.5 hours to complete driving test and Real ID application. Although line on left had no signs, it was for appointment only. Service was mostly friendly other than the driving test lady. She was strictly business and deducted points from stopping too far from the limit line (3 ft). One lady instructed us to come back after driving test to apply Real ID but when we did that she said we should've applied before driving test. 🚗👩‍🔬🤷‍♀️

PS. There was one employee that only wore a face shield without a mask that worked the testing kiosks and got very close to customers which is still very dangerous.< /Review>

Passed my driving test today, and I can tell you for a fact that the employees are professional, swift, courteous, and down-to-earth. San Mateo is nothing compared to other offices that are bustling and condescending. My examiner was both assertive and patient. She hardly made me nervous at all. Growing up here reminds me how civilized people are in the city. Definitely will consider coming back here as much as possible.</review>< user>

Bad customer service from some of the employees.  They can be rude and not helpful. The line outside is under the sun and they make you wait in the sun and they move to the shade when helping someone outside. I went there to pick up my car registration and stickers since we are moving and they sent me to the kiosk at Safeway. The Kiosk doesn’t give me the option to get my already paid registration and stickers! What a waste of time! What’s the DMV for if they can’t help me with basic things like this! Frustrating!!<//Text>

<Text>If you can, go take your driver’s test somewhere else. Do not come here. The person conducting my brother’s test failed him after two minutes of driving due to another driver’s reckless driving. It was a situation that wasn’t even his fault. Didn’t give him any type of chance and even called it a “tiny mistake” but still decided that it was big enough to fail him without any thought. He seemed irritated prior to the appointment already and appears to have taken it out on someone else. Very unprofessional.</Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

There was one man there with curly gray hair and a face shield (no mask) who was VERY obviously treating the young white high school girls differently than anyone of a different race. Raising your voice at someone that doesn't speak English well doesn't make them understand better! The line outside etc. was understandable due to Covid, but the socially distanced lines inside were incredibly confusing over by window 17/18 and camera A and people were being yelled at for not understanding/standing in the wrong spot and treated like children.  So incredibly rude, uncalled for, and unprofessional.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<text>Another CA DMV lives up to its reputation. Was recently there to update my driver license. FYI if you have an appointment I guess you are just supposed to go up towards the front of the line (entrance area) and just try to find someone with who works there. God forbid they have any signs indicating this so that you aren't told by another bystander to wait in the long line for non-appointments. They will check you in so that you can start the waiting process for your 'appointment' (mine was about a 20 minute wait for an 8:20am time). Be sure to check all your information to the absolute t on your new license; seems that copying and pasting my information was a bit much for them to handle, so I'll be going back to wait in the long line to get my motorcycle endorsement reinstated.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>It's still 4.30 PM and they don't allow to go in. The time mentioned everywhere that the closing time is 5 PM is false advertising of office closing time. They should correct the closing time if they are not allowing people to go in and get the work done. Waste of everyone's time here.</review>< Time>

I arrived at about 16:15 on a Friday, end of month (Jan 31) and was out of there by 17:30. I went in to resolve a demand for payment issue regarding my vehicle registration.

The non-appointment line flowed very quickly, I was in it only for about 15/20 minutes. The concierge helped me and provided me a number. I then sat in the waiting area for another 20 minutes or so.

When I was called, the agent who helped me was very friendly. I didn't catch his name but he was male, and was nice - chatted go Niners with me for a minute since this was the weekend before the Superbowl.

His computer froze on him, so he could not help me resolve my issue, but we walked me to another window and explained the situation to the female agent who was there - she was also very friendly.

They did have a processing issue with some notes on my account (I was supposed to get a discount that, of course, did not show in their system). I just paid in full, though, and they provided me paperwork to apply for a refund to get the discount thing sorted.

Last step was to confirm that the flag on my account was removed. Unfortunately, it wasn't and it was after 17:00 so they couldn't get in touch with Sacramento to confirm. However, this is why they get a 5-star review: they took down my information and told me they would take care of all this on Monday morning without me having to come back in, provided me full receipts and account numbers and backup paperwork so I could call myself, and provided me free of charge a temporary operating permit for a full 30 days so I could have peace of mind in operating my vehicle!

Thank you, DMV team, for making what is usually always a horror story a really, really positive experience.</Review>

They're open again. There's one big line for most everything, but if you are close to your appointment time go to someone with a clipboard/tablet and check with them.

BRING YOUR OWN HAND SANITIZER

no one's wiping down any doors or the thumb scanners and it's high traffic.<//Review>

I went in for a driver's license renewal to get REAL ID. Got in the non-appointment line at 7:30AM on a Friday and finished at 10:15AM, so a little under 3 hours total. The actual processing only took about 20 minutes. I'm sure you can do it faster if you arrive before 7AM, but I thought 3 hours wasn't too bad. My DMV person wasn't particularly friendly, but got the job done. If you're getting REAL ID for the first time, remember to fill out the application online and read the instructions ahead of time; it'll save a lot of time.</Review>

<review>With COVID-19, they are only admitting people with online application confirmation page (which you can print after finishing the online application) and existing appointments. The results are much less people. I went there around noon, the line is minimal. I got in and got things done very quickly. The staff inside the office is professional and polite. Also, they accept credit card here.

However, the lady who conducted the vehicle verification (who also seems to administrate the driving road tests) outside of the office is quite rude, unprofessional, incompetent, and kept a few of us waiting there with no information for almost an hour. It seems that her lunch break is noon to 1pm, but I don't think she actually started working until 1:30 pm. I could not imagine what a nightmare it would be to have her as the road test examiner.</review>< Pics>

I was so surprised I showed up at 7:40 am to get a real ID I thought I would be there for hours I had no appointment and I was done with everything by 8:30 am the interaction that I had with the associates while not all warm and fuzzy it was pleasant and quick</text>

Pretty efficient and friendly folks here.

Came for renewal of DL and came in 15 mins past the hour in the afternoon and was called within 8-10   upon check in.

The lady who took my online application was not personable but its coo since she worked fast and processed my application and payment with no issues.

I spent exactly 15 mins in and out of this DMV location without an appointment thank you San Mateo staff.

Update (I forgot to add)
I strongly advise to complete your application online versus completing then when you arrive at the dmv.  I think that really saved me so much time</review>< Pictures>

DMV employees are  Rude. Bad customer service.

To all the DMV employees: You probably don't like your job but you don't have to be rude to people and learn the  word "customer service". Just because you work for state GOVT doesn't mean you have to have "I DONT GIVE A DAMN" attitude. Remember, we work hard and pay taxes.

TO CA State: You should have yearly performance evaluation for your employees. What do you do when you receive complain against this employees.<//Text>

BEST DMV EXPERIENCE EVER!!!! I went on a Wednesday at about 3:30pm with no appt. I renewed my drivers licence, switching to the "Real ID" and took the written test too. All that and I was out the door in less than an hour! Everyone I encountered was friendly, helpful. It was a very surreal experience.<//review>

< review>
Ive been to many dmvs around california. Ive always appriciated the san mateo offiice. Its a little smaller then most offices and the staff are highly proffesional.   I should add even if there is a line, and i seldom had more than 12 or so folks in front of me, it moves very quickly and your in and out before you know it. Its quiet and theres the lunch wagon catering truck out backmid late mornings as i recall, or lunch hour, sorry dont know exact times its there,  it  offers foods n refreshments. . And here again, ive never really had a difficult time with any staff or persons in over 40 yrs of visits. San Mateo tho , its me favorite</review>

If you’re up to a DL, don’t go after 10:30am. You will waste a day in vain. I did that on July 5th (thu) and waited 3 hours in the line to get the number and fill up the application form. At 1:51pm I got the number and had to wait until 4:25 to get called for photo and fingerprint. And how I didn’t finish the process before 4:30pm I couldn’t do the writing test. So I got the receipt and had to comeback another day, get in line for another 3:30h to get the number to do the writing test and appointment to the driving test.
So for a DL, take the day off, arrive until 8:30am tops.
For registration only, you don’t need to wait in line, go straight to the attendant.
Its amazing how behind DMV is on technologies, specially in California, its a paradox. its just awful to see such a waste of production time of all those people in line every single day. Such waste of DMV resources.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Service was just okay. Went there after 4 months of wait for the appointment and the doors was closed due to some technical error in their systems. Had to wait 45 extra minutes just to get in. Its easier to go through with appointments as compared to without appointment. Some days are just relaxed as when I was there the line was quick so it really didn't matter after an hour whether you had appointment or not, everyone was inside with their queries etc. Staff won't be as polite, so you gotta make sure you do fill your application by making an online account before you come here. It would make your and theirs life thousand times easier. knowledge tests are taken on computers, while some have to give on papers due to excessive line of people. Parking isn't a issue here thankfully. The only reason for three stars is there are not very happy people working on desks. You just have to be quick, tolerant, do your homework before coming here.</text>

<Review>Always much faster for both appointments and Non-appointments than most other DMV offices. Definitely faster than Daly City.  Case in point. Today I renewed a vehicle registration. I arrived in line at Daly City to find the wait time to be 1 hour and 8 minutes.  Looking at the San Mateo wait time it reported 27 minutes wait.  But eve after the drive down I would come out ahead. Total ACTUAL time for driving, eating, and renewing registration was 41 minutes.  Wait time at San Mateo was less than estimated. I waited only 5 minutes.  The process was wonderful from the time I walked in the door until the time I wrote up this review. LOVE YOU SAN MATEO DMV office!  Job well done!< /Review>< Pictures>

I visited this DMV for applying for an ID as well as taking the written test. I was initially concerned with the low ratings and bad reviews of the staff but I personally had a really good experience interacting with the staff here. They were very helpful and efficient. I'd definitely recommend this for any DL/ID related issues if you're in / around SF.< /review>

Smooth flow but packed on a Monday afternoon as to be expected. I was there for 3 hrs and was given information I could have been given almost 6mos ago when I came in for the same thing. It took almost 5 months to clear up that issue and now when I think it's clear... There's more info, someone gave me only the first part. And now another process begins for me just to end up back there trying again. Disappointed to not get all the pertinent info in my first visit. That first visit was not bad at all, only about 1 hour on a Wednesday just fyi. Wish me luck on visit #3!<//review>

<review>Plan for a long waiting time. Check on Google maps for the bar graft which shows the least busiest times. And because it’s the DMV I do have a complaint. If my local ‘taco truck’ always has hand disinfectant why can’t the DMV supply some for those that must put their fingers on the electronic fingerprint scanner, which seems rarely disinfected, after lots of people have touch it that day?<//review>< Pics>

Here is always gonna be people waiting in a line. So make sure you have enough time.
*** If you are new to Ca, and you planning to get new drivers license its not a place for you, they accept by appointments only. I waited here 2 hours, and they told me they dont do it here. It was my mistake thou. So I went to San jose DmV.< /Text>

super low level of work quality. They forgot to scan and check my passport but they told me process was completed and just wait to receive my actual card. but never received more than 2 months. When I visited DMV , they just told me you didn’t bring any document last time bring it again without saying sorry.
If they actually scanned my document, they should have known what document I submitted but I asked 2 persons , both of them asked me what kind of document did I submit. so they forgot to scan and store my last document in the system and can’t check what kind of document I submitted.

I know some people make mistakes but their attitude is terrible.<//Review>

I have never heard that from DMV employees at any other DMV office I have been to in the past. The computers for taking a driver's license test and for filling out other forms (driver's license and state ID application and renewal, etc.) are a nice feature which not only help reduce wait times, but also help the DMV use less paper.</text><user_name>Robert Whitaker< /user_name>< UserId.>

Honestly it wasn’t bad. The non-appointment line want by quickly  (20 min in line, 20 min wait) and the people were friendly and helpful. No issues whatsoever—would definitely come back. I went midday and it wasn’t overly crowded.< /text>

Arrived 6:35am was about 25 people back from the front of the line. But by 7am line is about 60 people long and easy 100 by the time 8am rolls around. Non appointments line up on the west side of the building easy to notice by the long line of people.. Also there is no parking onsite as the gates to the parking lot are closed until 8am. Park carefully as there were cars being towed for blocking driveways. However they do open the door around 7:30am and begin to have people enter in groups of 5 to fill out information/applications. It's pretty organized but you do need to arrive early if you want to be out of there before 9am. Also NO credit card payments for services. Staff were great polite and helpful. The DMV really needs to increase the hours they are open for operations at least open the car park at 7am?</review>

Staff are pretty helpful here. An employee even went out of the building before it opened, to help people in line go through their docs.

Got here on the first work day of a week at 7:39 and seated with a number at around 8:15. Out of the door at 8:44.< /Review>

<Text>I had a very pleasant experience here. Didn’t have an appointment, so I arrived just before 7am to wait in line on a Friday morning. Only 6 people ahead of me, more people started showing up after about 7:15am. Once the doors opened at 8am, I was called to a window right away - and done in 20 minutes! Every employee I interacted with was very helpful and just overall nice. Best experience I’ve ever had at the DMV.<//Text>< pictures>

Went around 1:30 on Friday for a knowledge test. Got it by 3:00. I read about the reviews and was scared. But everyone was polite and patient. I went to window 4 and the lady was very polite and understanding. Definitely I would recommend to this DMV.<//Text>

One of the better DMVs but it still took me a long time to get served. When I went to the window 4 the lady was super rude and just looking at her computer surfing the internet... the front people are nice though which I appreciate! I still had to leave without getting served because I had to rush back to my job and thinking about coming back again and waiting is killing me< /review>

I just come to San Mateo DMV because it’s close to my place and also because it’s almost never a long line, but mostly all the people who works here seems to be in a bad mood and also mad all the time, worth DMV customer service ever, I’ve been in others DMV and I have never had this bad experience, today the guy who had to take care of my paperwork was the worth person ever in my life for a customer service, come on, if you can not to this job just give up and give it to those who are nicer.<//text>

7am opens, but line forms at back, West door.
Expect at least a 30 min Standing wait in line. 40 outdoor chairs would be nice.
Very few DMV employees at opening hour.
Bring a jacket and hat.
And a light little walker with a seat if you have one!

The clerk at the head of the line before the counter has too small a desk for paperwork and is too slow.

Here to renew my DL and had to fill out an online Application to Renew a DL, since they only mailed me the Notice to Renew.

The terminal on the left corner is too shaky and hard to fill out.
Use the keypad for 8 digit birthday, not the on-screen scroll arrows.
Another 15minutes...

Clerk at Window #5 forgot my SSA card was still under the cover of the printer... for about 15min.

The clock on the back wall is too small, unlit, and too hard to read from the front, with 20/20 vision.
Waiting in the front main seating area...
Probably another 30min...
Bathroom is behind us.
Is that old harsh florescent tube ceiling lighting??

Waiting to take Written Test.
Then Fingerprint and Photo.
Only one chair for Handicaps test taking;
What about us old Senior Citizens with canes and bad knees?

If you have Any Commercial issues, try to go to the Mtn View Commercial DMV office instead.

Wish they would stop using hooked 6s and hooked 9s.
And 3s that look like 8s.

9:15am,,,2 hours,,,still waiting,,,

No mirror below or near the camera ,,,so you know how much to smile! Tsk tsk.

The nice old woman Employee in the test area wearing black and pink had no visible Employee Badge.
Most Employees do not wear a necklace ID badge, just 1guy did.
And the DL test questions were not numbered on screen, like #1/18.
Also the "submit" button is too thin and did not work several times.
All screens should have chairs.
Only one low Handicap screen with chair!

10:15am,,,3hrs 15min,,, still waiting, after Photo, Fingerprint(works better if you hold it in your left hand), and 18 question DL Renew License Test.

My fav fastest DMV office is hwy 24x680, then also small Santa Teresa in SJ.
Avoid Golden Gate Park location and Fremont!!

6Feb2020, got my new high security DL in a week!
But it's the Worst color photo ever! All yellow!
Just something else DMV needs to fix!<//text>

<text>Today I took my driving test here, and passed! This DMV is far less busy than the Daly City one. No line stretching out into the sidewalk. There was only one car ahead of me in the test line, and the examiner was very nice. I've been here for other matters and they always have their affairs in order, yet also not seeming curt. Would recommend!</text>< Rating>

<review>Found a great gem, San Mateo DMV office has friendly staff and relatively short wait times. Come here instead of the always over-crowded SF and Daly City locations.

Pro-tip 1: Make sure you do online registration to save time.
Pro-tip 2: Aim to get there before 5pm closing. Typical wait times close to closing will be under 1 hour.< /review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>I have been waiting for over 4 months for my Real ID.  I can only guess this DMV messed up something in their paperwork.  Additionally when my wife applied they did the entire form wrong and had her scheduled to take a test she did not have to take.  Just low quality.< /review>< Pics>

The best, quickest, and most efficient DMV Ive ever been to. Got here before 4pm left before 5pm. (I couldve left earlier if I hadnt missed my number lol) Served by Ruben at window 5 and he was very friendly and sweet. Also the gentleman that helped  at the drivers license application computers was nice and helpful.</review>

<text>I got my permit last December and I've been trying to get a License since then. The waiting period for an appointment is a ridiculous 2 months and growing. It is also very difficult to pass in this DMV. When I went for my test, all the 4 test takers failed behind the wheel test, including me.

The DMV was very bad when I wrote my permit test in December but now it seems to have improved. Current employees are more efficient but the number of employees is still less. I went at 6 AM for permit test last Friday and there were 10 people ahead of me. At 8 AM a lady started checking documents outside. If you are an international student, make sure that you have your i94 along with Address Proof, EAD, SSN and other documents. I did not have i94, so I had to go and get it, because of which I lost time. However, after coming back, the process was quicker than I expected. I filled an application form via the web URL they gave in my mobile phone to skip a step. Then waited until my number is called to submit my documents, then another line for my photograph, then the test and I was done by 10:30 AM.</text>< pictures>

Was sent back twice, first time my  I 94 on the Ipad or mailing them wasnt enough. Second time I had the I 94 printed with me, but it was 14 days older than my last entry to the US ( I travel a lot) so again Ipad or Email was not possible so had to leave again. Worst experience, twice queuing up at 6:30 in the morning for nothing. Also the women couldn't even tell me if I can do the behind the wheel test on a scooter and not a motorcycle.<//text>

This office seems to consistently be far less busy than others on the peninsula.  The two or three times I've been there, I've also found the people to be far friendlier than what I'm used to... maybe because it's not as busy and stressful?  I don't know.  Definitely the best DMV office in the area, in my opinion.<//Text>

<Review>I went for a simple VIN verification which has only taken me 10 minutes at this location in the past with longer lines than they had today. The woman working the lines continuously helped people that came well after me. My windows were open, my baby was in the back screaming his head off after waiting so long, and she never even knowledged or greeted me. She then smirked at me when we made eye contact as I drove off because I could not sit there and wait any longer.< /Review><Name>Kayla Anderson</Name><rate>1<//rate><GmapID>0x808f9dda44dfe47d:0x55ae98ca132e0d47</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>If you have an appointment and come on time - you'll be serviced very quickly. A suggestion to book an appointment online - try to search for an appointment several times a day for 1-2 days. You'll find free slots for upcoming dates very quickly. E.g. when average wait period was 1-1.5 month for the next available date, after half day of retries I found a time for the next day! The same trick I did with behind the wheel.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Very rude. My passport won't pass the system in San Jose DMV and they suggested me to come here to try again, the woman kept on laughing at me as if everything is my fault. And my passport didn't pass again, have to update my passport first because of their silly system. I got no respect here.< /Review>

I had an absolutely frightening experience! I was told by a “technician “ on the 16 Th of May that because I have corrected lenses which are “mono vision” and could not cover one eye to read chart ( cataract surgery 4 years ago) that I needed a Dr.s ok. I received the form, passed my test with 💯% and had photo taken. The next day, I received the clearance from my Dr( who filled out the lengthy forms) and returned to your facility and stood for 45 minutes in the “no appointment line”. Another hour passed ( 3 :15 pm and I was called to window 11 where I was immediately harassed by the woman in attendance there. I explained that the wait for a “return appointment) , which was incorrectly required, should not be as long as the original wait which was very easy and pleasant. She took offense, suggested I go someplace else closer to home ....ie. Daly City/ San Francisco? I live directly up the hill from the San Mateo office. 🤓 After I asked her to show me her badge( it was tucked in her shirt) , she explained to me “why, you can file a report today and tomorrow you won’t have a license and I will have my job”. This made me realize that there was NO way I would carry this any further. Then.....her next comment was made with a smirk on her face....”you have to take the test”. I said I already had passed and would not take it again. At last resort, she looked on the computer and saw that this was true. She shoved my temporary license @ me and said “get outta here”. I did and fast.
What a miserable 😩 person to have in a public service position. No wonder, your facility only received 2 stars. Very sad.
I have sent a copy to Governor Newsome and the local newspaper.
Very sad , as the only way to avoid this is to go to a more rural DMV office where the employees are happy with their job !

The worse DMV office in Bay Area. Having appointment doesn’t work even for driving test. The unhappy and non friendly employees makes you more nerves especially for teenagers who want to take Driving test for first time.</review>

Horrible “no-system.”  A completely disorganized operation that needs to be overhauled. If you make an appointment, don’t expect to have it honored anytime close to the scheduled time.  Plan on spending a couple of extra hours.

Listening to some of the others in line while waiting evoked these comments...”this place is ridiculous;” the DMV guy in the purple union shirt is so rude. I just asked him a question and he said I was wasting his time;” “I’m never coming back to this place again;” and  “got here with an appointment at 1 and I’m still here (2:25)”

Suddenly looking forward to self - driving cars.</review>

Considering this is the DMV, and the entire system is horrendously outdated and inefficient, I was quite satisfied with my experience at this branch.  I had no appointment, so showed up at 6:40 with a line of some 15 people.  I was pleased and surprised when the doors opened early at 7:30.  We were greeted and directed to the appropriate line and given slips of paper to expedite the check-in process.

I was inside by 8:00 and was directed to a small kiosk where a helpful gentleman assisted people. He pointed us to the right line where we them received our queue number.  The line was short and I had my number in about 15 minutes.  After this it was a mere 10 minutes more until my number was called.

I was greeted cordially and asked if I had my documents ready.  Since I was doing a license renewal, they needed things like a passport, SS card or 401k, etc.  The process took another 10 minutes and was pain free.  The representative was courteous and dutiful.

Finally I was directed to the picture line to get the new photo (hoping it turned out well) and that was it!  I was out by 8:40.

Despite the outdated system, the workers made this place tick.  None seemed stressed or overworked which was refreshing, and I never felt silly for asking questions.

Bottom line, avood going in person if you can, but if you must, make an appointment (2 months in advance).  If you don't have an appointment, come here at least 90 minutes before they open and you should have a pretty painless experience.  Bring a lawn chair and snacks if you come later because your non-apppintment wait time will exponentially increase the later you arrive (see my SF DMV review).<//Text>

<review>The DMV is a perfect example of what happens when there is no incentive or competition to make the experience more enjoyable or tolerable for the public.  This coupled with the fact that very often this brings out people’s true nature when they get impatient.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Text>San mateo dmv made my day, I was able to get to work on time and the service was stunning. I was there on a busy Tuesday around 10:30am, I was out of there by around 12:20pm. Compared to sf dmv and daly city, the San Mateo dmv office is much more efficient.</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSkWglRaujeajW0rH5mQ65sbHmWu46k20eekG3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Just like every other DMV even if you show up at 8am when they open you still have to wait in line for about an hour if not more. However the staff is very friendly and answered all my questions. I would recommend making an appointment however when I tried the soonest opening was 2.5 months out.<//text>

<Rate>4</Rate><review>It’s the DMV, so don’t expect anything special. The whole CA DMV system is a joke compared to the U.K. I’ve never seen such a clunky and inefficient system (hey DMV have you heard of this new thing called ‘the internet’? Other countries use it for extensions, renewals, registrations etc. Look into it, I hear it’s the next big thing in 1998.)

Anyway, onto this specific branch of the DMV. I’ve been to Oakland Coliseum (friendly staff, not overly busy) and San Francisco city (the rudest, most aggressive and foul staff you’ve ever come across. Anywhere.). The staff at the San Mateo branch are clearly trying to do their best with what they have. They were chatty and friendly, but also seemed to get the job done. I’m sure there’s some bad eggs, as this is the DMV after all, but overall they seemed to be aware that no-one wants to be here, and that they were allowed to at least smile.

On the downside, my driving test was supposed to be at 11.40. Got there at 11 to check in. My test eventually took place at 2pm. Like other DMVs, the queue for a ticket was round the block, so only go if you have an appointment or have no other option.</review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

To the lady with the beautiful long white hair who spoke to me in spanish, I hope this will get to you one day.
Thank you for making it such an easy experience to get everything done. It is quite nerve racking for a foreigner these days to have all the paperwork and passing the driving test for a different country. It has been a hard couple of months moving here and it was great chatting with you.
I hope one day you can make it to Barcelona, disfrútelo por mi :)< /text>

If you don’t have an appointment, there will be a billion people in line. If you have an appointment, which usually will arrange months after, there will be only a million people in line. Don’t even think about get things done in 3 hours. I bet DMV is the most inefficient government department in US<//Review>

I recently moved to the USA from Europe and  had to go there. Worse place to visit ever with horrible stuff which is rude, unprofessional and apathetic. Had to visit them twice because of these amazing unified traits, across the board from manager to examiners. At some point, I needed to see the Manager; he was inaccessible. PLEASE AVOID THIS PLACE AT ANY CAST.<//text>

<Text>I’ll save you (the reader) your time by advicing you to go some other dmv because this dmv wasted 2 precious years of my life when i needed my driving licence so badly but no... these ppl don’t care about you or your driving
Rather they will nitpick small small stupid points to fail you. I dont know why i kept choosing the San Mateo dmv but finally i decided to go Santa clara and i passed.
No hatred for these people but my advice will be just a gnore them and go to some other dmv.</Text>< pics>

So if you’re prepared and have the right expectations, the DMV isn’t bad

I came at 6:45am on a Tuesday evening. Was basically #15 in line when I arrived, and was able to complete my paperwork (motorcycle + driver license) by 9:10am with very little waiting inside.

Some things that help me: double and triple check that you have the right documents the night before. Being patient and courteous goes a long way - remember that the employees there are humans who do soul-crushing paperwork every day and every week. Bring a book to read while you wait outside (lol)

Monday and Fridays are the busiest days. Waking up early sucks, but helps with avoiding the craziness when it gets bogged down. The facilities are clean, and the staff is nice<//Text>

No.12 counter guy is rudest person I have ever seen.He seems not be paid and extremely rude to people. It seems all the people here speak Spanish only and if you don't understand their strong accent English and ask"excuse me?" They will not explain you again and keep silent. If you don't want this job, quit it, don't revenge the society by working inDMV, thank you.<//text>

The worst part is I misplaced my house keys, and had to return to the san mateo field office to retrace my steps. These guys had the audacity to lock the doors, and refused to open the doors. I knocked on the door multiple times to ask for assistance, and they looked me dead in my face and said no. I understand they weren't taking anymore customers, but damn would it have been too much for someone to open the door to let me look for my keys. Now, I have to rent a room because these guys chose to be total jerks and waste my time. I'll be back tomorrow for sure. If I could rate them negative stars I definitely would.  Standing outside the dmv while they deliberately ignored me was beyond humiliating. I hope no one ever experiences something like that. I will definitely be filing a complaint.</review>< Pics>

<Review>Never had such bad experience in my life, even in China. I will say it sucks and makes me feel so mad about this DMV. I made an appointment at 10. The front desk needs my 2 mail stubs to verify the address and told me if I cannot get back in 15 min I need to get in the long line again. So rude, not nice and absolutely unfriendly. After I went back home and get the 2 mail stubs and arrive at 10:40, the front desk just refused me and say "Your appointment time is off. I will never say it again" and ask me to go to the end of line. I am thinking "FXXK yall, go to H*LL".<//Review>< name>

<review>This place is extremely crowded. However, it is relatively less crowded than the other nearby DMVs (Redwood city). After reading the other reviews, I decided its better to get their early and wait in the early morning, which would then get me ahead in the waiting line (before doors open). Note that the parking lot opens only at 8 am. Hence, you will be parking on the roadside. Note that there is street cleaning on 2nd and 4th Tuesdays from 10 to noon (I think). So make sure you are done by then. Also note the DMV opens at 9 am on Wednesdays and 8 am on the rest of the days. I think Thursday is relatively less crowded. I was there at 6:10 am. I was 3rd in line :-) At 7:45 am a gentleman comes out of the DMV office and splits the people waiting in two lines. One on the left for non license renewals and the one on the right for license renewals. For license renewals he also provides a link to fill out an online application form - I advice in doing this a day prior and taking a print out of the conf number of the online form. They open the doors at 8 am. The left most line (C - I think) is for license renewals. I got counter 7 with no wait time and was done in 10 minutes - eye test, photos taken, right thumb print taken, fees paid via debit card. Note that the $35 fees for license renewal is by cash, check or debit card - no credit cards. The lady in the counter was thorough, courteous and efficient. Overall, it helps to be prepared of lines and delays.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<review>Excellent Services, helpful staff and they are trying their best to help everyone out. Yes, no one is perfect, the problem with time-management and system or other technical issues can pop up once in a while, but you don't have to blame the staff for those issues. The lady who did the verification of my vehicle and the one who processed my registration were nice and could not have been nicer than that. The only big issue with all CA's DMVs are, there aren't enough DMVs and their building sizes are smaller compare the to number of users and the staff numbers are few. So you don't have to blame their current staff for long wait and slow processing time. There are hundreds of people rushing to every DMVs everyday, so the government of CA needs to expand the size and number of their DMV facilities and the number of their staff in all DMVs across CA.< /review><Time>1530020177252< /Time><Resp>None< /Resp><user>115286867973996169417<//user><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Rate>

Arrived without an appointment at 4 pm on an August Wednesday. The "No appointment" line was back to the door. Nevertheless I got my number in 6 minutes. Was finally seen at 4:34, and finished by 4:37 (registration renewal). In that time there were between 30 and 40 people served. Seems wonderfully efficient and everyone was pleasant and helpful. The only negative was that the video screens showing the numbers being called and served was stuck and not updating, presenting false information.<//Text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>Went to take driving test, absolutely horrible. Waited 2 hours after my appointment so I had to test in traffic, got an extremely rude and arrogant proctor who was extremely vague and got defensive when I asked for clarification and was extremely apathetic as well. I am appalled at my experience today and would not recommend this DMV to anyone who wants to take their test. Awful examiners,  the roads are crammed and tight, traffic is bad during the afternoon because of it's proximity to San Mateo High School, and the wait times are extremely long. Don't waste your time with this place, go somewhere else.</review>< pics>

I had to visit this dmv 4 times for about 5 hours from (11 am to 4 pm) which is almot 20 hrs to get my state id. And still didn’t get it. Also, staffs are rude too. I would have gave you guys zero star if possible.
A lot to improve towards costumer service.</text>

<Text>If you dont have an appointment, get at least  a min of 3 hours to fall in line.there is one receptionist who handles all the non appointment and with an appointment ....if they see that all lines are busy  they should add one or two more receptionist to handle and accomodate. this people.dmv employees should experience how to wait a minimun of 3hrs  standing,under the heat of the sun ,hungry and bored.< /Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

If I could give zero stars - I would. Went there twice to get state ID, it is still not delivered. When I call - they say it was returned to them (twice). No reason why. I stood in line for 4 hours the first time and 5.5 hours the second time. And they have asked me to go visit the office and stand in line for hours again for their mistake.< /Review>

However, for the third or fourth year in a row, I have to go back and talk with someone about the fact that they haven't sent me my registration bill.  I've had the people behind the desk confirm to me that my current address is in the system, yet this keeps happening.  I don't know if it's a problem with this particular office itself or the computer system they use, but I'm really tired of having to go in to pay my registration and get my tags, when the bill should be coming directly to me in the mail a couple months ahead of its due date.

Money is tight for me and I can't afford to pay late fees on a mistake they keep on making.  This isn't right.</Text><UserId.>103670070667845180940</UserId.><Pics>None</Pics>< user_name>

Compared to the DMV offices in San Francisco and in Daly City, the San Mateo location is by far the quickest moving and the best one for last minute visits.  Of course make an appointment online when possible, but life happens and we don't all make appointments.  I was off on a weekday and needed to have my photo taken for a new driver's license.  I live closest to the Daly City location.  I checked the DMV site online and found that the DC wait time was much shorter than SF.  I drove to Daly City without an appointment and couldn't even park.  There was a long line out the door.  I decided to drive farther to San Mateo.  There was plenty of parking and no line out the door.  I got into a short line, waited briefly, had a new photo taken and was out the door in less than half an hour.</review>

Different than all other DMV, this place not allow you to renew your registration if it is not on it's due day.  The male receptionist will rudely point you to a wall notification written in English and Chinese.  You have to buy a money order and drop your registration in the box.  It wasted me more than one hour to have learned it.  Why I say he is rude?  He didn't explain to me in one sentence why, and not allowed me ask a question before he helped next customer.  This place is not like United States of America.  Law?  Policy?  You have to see and believe.</Review>

<text>This place is a monstrosity if government failure. I waited here for an hour and half yesterday for them to tell me they couldn’t help me and to call a number. I spent an hour on hold this morning. The people on the dmv phone number told me I had to comeback in.
I’ve been here for 2 hours and 25 minutes and I’m still 40 foot from the entrance. This place sucks and these people need to be fired< /text>< Pics>

What a mess! Went in today with an appointment and waited over an hour in the wrong line since there were tiny signs covered up by the people in the line.

The non appointment line was 3-4 hours long and there was no order or direction given by staff.

Clerks tended to people that cut in line and walked up to them without saying a word.

The system went down after a while and there was little instruction as far as what was still being processed and what couldn't be done.< /Text>

First of all DMV should hire a manager that speaks English and understand English fluently. Me Pablito Cruz seems to be an foreigner and does not even understand English and can explain anything cause of his frustration. Seems like he is overwhelmed with home issue and can't talk right. When I was trying to discuss an issue he started getting loud and walked away from me 2 times, and came back and tells me that he is tiered of his job. He did refuse to answer my question and walked away for the 3rd time!!!!
Is that how you treat American society Mr Pabloto Cruz. Never had envy position befor and now he's abusive to others!!!
The worst manager and service I have ever experienced.
Did not understand one word what he was saying!!!
But I do understand there frustration at work and the cause of being abusiev to others!!!
Good luck to you guys</Text>

Tried to make an appointment online today. The next available appt was 5 days out! Now sitting and waiting after talking to a friendly clerk on what forms I need to fill out. I have 22 people ahead of me. I am going to be here for awhile. Brought a book to read. . .  Total time here was 1 1/2 hours. Actual time with the clerk after giving her my ticket number less than 7 minutes.<//Text>

I did not have an appointment, the overall time for my work was less than 2 hours in the San Mateo DMV, which took 4 hours and unfinished work in Fremont DMV.  The people were friendly and got my work done with a smile and without any fuss.< /Text>

<review>Had my driving test with picture of confirmation and this incompetent people didn’t find it on the system so even with my picture they wouldn’t allow me to do it . Besides that problem this people are the rudest people in the face of the earth , they all deserve to be unemployed ASAP. I’m so pissed off and disappointed by their behavior towards old people and hard working people that are just trying to fill some papers ....they really need to switch employees tomorrow< /review></record>

<Text>If there is condition where this is the only DMV in USA then, I would rather stay at home and never apply for ID or license. This DMV sucks, specially the staffs and management. They sent incomplete documents for verification which took almost 3 months to get my brother’s ID.</Text><gmap_id>0x808f9dda44dfe47d:0x55ae98ca132e0d47</gmap_id></record>
