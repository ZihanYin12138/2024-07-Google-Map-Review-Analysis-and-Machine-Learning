<Review>They have the highest quality meat and poultry and it's sold at a reasonable price. They also do an excellent job of managing space so that patrons are not crowded while in the shop. I give 10/10. Will visit again.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

Recently I am trying to go low carb and they are so sweet to accommodate me by making it without the bread. Some places don’t wrap it well enough and it’s hard to eat a lettuce wrap sandwich without stuff falling out but schaub’s employees always made sure the lettuce wrap around the ingredients nicely so that eating it is a breeze!  And they wrap the ingredients win lots of lettuce so I never ever miss not having the bread! Love this place!<//review><username>Ruohan Hsieh<//username>< resp>

<user_name>Cecily Buckner<//user_name><Text>I love Schaubs. High quality food and good service. However you should be careful about what you order if you have meat allergies. I am allergic to turkey and* always make sure to ask about products being turkey free. The guy working there indicated an assortment of sausages contained NO turkey, just chicken (which I have no reaction to!) Either he was wrong or their sausages were contaminated, because I ate the sausage and low and behold, I had an allergic reaction. The sausage is the only thing I've eaten where I could not identify what was inside, and turkey is my only allergy. This is a five star place but I can only give one star because food safety is important and more care needs to be taken by the workers here.</Text>< userid>

Fred’s Marinated Sirloin and Fred’s Burgers are both absolutely fantastic when barbecued. The presentation of the sirloin definitely makes a good talking point. I was really tempted to buy a sandwich while I was here too, but I’d only just eaten…</Review>

<Review>What an unpleasant experience at Schaub's this morning because of a woman working at the meat counter. What should have been a respite from donning more than just a facemask as personal protective equipment and time to stop thinking of the dangers of and the exhaustion from the situation in which we find ourselves, there in front of me was a stark reminder that not everyone has the capacity for human empathy. The continued HARASSMENT and attack on my character by this woman at the meat counter, then at the register, for the simple request of having meat separated into two packs, left much to be desired. It took all of 5 minutes to fulfill my order, but would have been less if she had stopped talking. My experiences at Schaub have typically been pleasant.... respectful, kind and helpful people, especially Jason. I hope that one day this woman will learn kindness because one day, she will need the kindness of a stranger. It will take a lot of thought on my part to get me back into Schaub, and if I do, I will ensure that this woman will not be the one with whom I interact.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

When it came to us, she rushed us out of the store. Our daughter's said she was staying at them like they were going to steal something.

Not many stores would do this.
I would definitely go back.  The skirt steak was delicious.</Review>< username>

< Review>
The Fred Steak from Schaub's is a local institution. It's so go in fact that it surpasses the steaks at most of the local restaurants but you can only buy it here. The recipe is a secret and the copy cats aren't close.

The steak is jet black and not very appealing, for me that's half the fun, shocking guests with such an unappetizing piece of meat. Any concerns they might have had disappear the moment they taste it however.

Guests from out of town now request the Fred Steak when they visit because it is such a treat.< /Review>

Don't let the gruff butchers deter you.  This place has a terrific selection of, er, meat, fish and poultry.  Highlights are their dry aged prime beef, artisan sausages, and, of course, the famous, black, Fred's Steak.<//text>

<Review>Well, been buying Fred's Steak for 20 years. Wiki recipes don't come close. Like much in life, you have to, in this case, ante up big for the real thing. Never bought anything else there, and frankly, when I go, the crowd is always clustered around the mountain of pricey (some say overpriced) marinated Top Sirloin. I guess that's the cut. But someone said TriTip.<//Review>< Rating>

The Fred steaks — as well as the Fred burgers which have the signature rub incorporated throughout the meat — are a bit of a local legend.</review>

<user_name>Tammy Love<//user_name><Response>None< /Response><text>This was my first time ever stepping into this dealership. & let me tell you. Karz Plus goes way beyond to help you out. They will not stop fighting until you leave without a vehicle. I personally have bad credit & also have a repo on my credit, but karz plus did it. Several dealerships had denied me because of my credit & needed a co signer, but this place was awesome. Great customer service from the beginning to the end. They're not like other dealerships that are very pushy to force you of purchasing a vehicle. They work with you. whoever reads  this and decides to finance a vehicle at Karz Plus ask for Jose! He is the best. He will go out his way to help you with a vehicle. Thanks Jose for not giving up & now I have a beautiful 2011 Ford Escape :) !!!!< /text><GmapID>0x80d952408e136b15:0x94ce8cb4d6961f7c< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<rating>5</rating><Review>I've had a great experience with the Karz Plus Team and Stephen Fuentes in particular.

Early on when I was still just gathering info, Stephen was very responsive to my questions and took time to help me understand what would be needed to overcome the obstacles to getting a deal worked out.

So when it was time to make a purchase I was happy to come in and speak with Stephen to see what kind of deal he work out for me. All I can say is that Stephen is quite good at this and managed to secure an offer for me that was better than I had hoped for.

I left that afternoon with the car I wanted at a better rate than expected and a big smile :)

Thanks Stephen and thanks to the Karz Plus Team!</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

I would recommend Karz Plus to anyone looking for a new car. All my questions were answered and the process was fast and efficient.

<text>Sold me a car and told me they’d fix the problems I seen. That never got done. Printed out a car fax report and everything and when I took it to an actual dealership they showed me more things that were poorly fixed on the car to sell it. Jose said nobody would finance me but later I found out I was approved for a better car I applied for with lower payments. They get anyone approved but sell “As is” cars that aren’t worth half the price. Don’t be taken advantage of< /text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

I bought a car from here and so have other friends and we've all had the same problem. Not to include keys that don't work right. Their so-called key guy texting me to schedule an appointment and when I was at work I couldn't answer him he told me okay bye You don't need your key fixed. On top of that my on top of that my AC hardly ever worked until I had to pay out-of-pocket to get it fixed even though I let them know a month before their so-called warranty ended. Also 300 mi into the car two of the vehicle tire sensors gave out and they wouldn't replace them So of course I've had to pay out of pocket. I wouldn't seriously recommend rethinking purchasing a car from here unless you're absolutely desperate for guaranteed financing. They told me my car would be financed at 12% and ended up being at 22.thank God I was able to refinance it to a different company within a year but they will seriously f*** you over< /Text>< response>

<time>1577576536722</time><rating>1</rating><Text>This is EASILY the absolute WORST used car dealership in San Diego. My fiance bought an economical car from here and it had mechanical issues within the first week of his purchase! We took the vehicle back within the first 30 days TWICE and STILL HAD THE EXACT SAME PROBLEMS with the engine. We Drive this vehicle to work, the gym and straight home. The vehicle started randomly smoking when the car was OFF and PARKED. Needless to say, I'm traumatized at the fact that when we lifted the hood to see WHAT happened, the piece's that were supposed to be fixed by their mechanic were GLUED AND ZIP TIED back together. Not to mention the night he PURCHASED the vehicle, the MECHANIC at the dealership smelled heavily like ALCOHOL and I hadn't noticed until AFTER my fiance had already signed the paperwork!!! PLEASE, FOR YOUR OWN SAKE, DO NOT PURCHASE A VEHICLE HERE! We will be taking LEGAL ACTION to deal with this situation as the entire process has violated his 6th basic consumer RIGHT TO REDRESS. THE IMPRESSION THAT "JULIE", THE SCUM SALES WOMAN WHOM SOLD HIM THE VEHICLE, GIVES OFF TO HER POTENTIAL AND CURRENT CUSTOMERS IS A COMPLETE CHARADE FOR THE SAKE OF A SALE! This is NOT the place to go for a car if you are truly wanting a "good deal" on a used vehicle due to the DOWNWARD SPIRAL of mechanical and technical problems you will endure in the long run. Please save yourself the trouble!!!<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80d952408e136b15:0x94ce8cb4d6961f7c</gmap_id></record>

Jose is the absolute best! He made purchasing my first vehicle very easy and smooth. I left the National City location confident that me and my family will no longer have to wait on public transportation to get through our everyday lives. He was very professional and informative! Let’s cut to the chase - if you’re credit is not all the great, you can’t afford to buy a brand new car, and you desperately need one..Karz Plus is where you need to go! All the staff there was very welcoming and friendly. I am completely satisfied and blessed with the vehicle I purchased!!

2014, low miles & runs excellent!!

<Review>Don't ever buy a car from here. They sold me a lemon. Took it back 8 times within the first month and a half. They promised work to be done to repair the issue and they lied about agreeing to it. They're thieves . Value auto repair has a bunch of there newly sold cars getting repaired after being off the lot for a day or 2. They're a bunch of crooks that buy the bottom of the barrel cars and try to flip for a killing. You've been warned. Someone should be jailed there!!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Rate>

I came to Karz Plus because I thought that they had a 2010 Chevy Equinox at their lot. After arriving and walking the entire lot for five minutes I didn't see it. One of what appeared to be a salesman lit up a cigarette in front of the garage turned office, yet no one approached me to help me out. I walk into the office and there are two desks as well as the blaring sounds of Sunday morning football. The salesmen, one young and one old remained seated, as I have to walk in and ask if they had the car I was looking for. The younger salesman says they don't have it and it's up at the Escondido dealership, I said I thought it was listed here and he went on the website to look it up. He asked if I wanted it driven down and I said I wanted it today, so don't worry, to which he said he'll let them know we're coming. I ended up driving up myself and getting a different car at the dealership, but this young, clearly delusional salesman said he "helped" us and he was entitled to the commission, as I would discover while signing my contract in Escondido. What an absolute joke! Have some standards and act like you're mildly interested in your work. Be ethical enough to give credit to the people that do the work rather than being the slimy, cheap car salesmen we all dread when we look for a new vehicle.<//text>

Scam. Do not go through them. They're nice when selling the car but when you report problems they're condescending and refuse to fix it. They offer quick fixes that doesn't fix the actual problem but only to get you out the door until your warranty expires. I had a problem a month after getting the car they changed the battery when I told them it was the ignition. Im still within my warranty and they won't fix a problem that was there from the beginning. Please be careful they will sell you a lemon.</Review>

Bought a LEMON from this dealership! TRANSMISSION ISSUES AND THEY WONT OWN UP TO FIXING IT! Do not purchase from here! They will quickly get you approved for a loan WITH HIGH INTEREST RATE but in the long run you will REGRET it! WORST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE BUYING A CAR FROM THIS DEALERSHIP! DONT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID!!!<//review>

Do not buy a car at cars plus, worst place to assist you with great service!
before you buy the car make sure they fix all the issues. Because after they will act like they can't do much to help. WORST PLACE !!!!!!!!
service like they give this location will be shut down in no time</Review>

<review>Jose was an awesome sales man, got me into a nice car, fast friendly service once he helped with the sale.Because the first sales guy gave me a list to choose from and they didn't have any of the cars on the list on the lot which i thought was very odd.  However Mark the manager/owner is the polar opposite, very rude and not nice has no phone skills or customer service skills at all.I believe they still don't have my car financed, I called to make my balloon down payment of $300 he wouldn't take it,requested all my income verification's  again and said he would call me back. mind you I'm battling cancer so i had been off work like a week since i got the car. He called me back  a week later i paid half$150 and he agreed to take the rest on may 4th.I get a call from Mark may 2nd and a text stating i am currently past due $443.27 and its urgent i call them before 12pm today. I call back and speak to mark again who is super rude telling me I'm late and hes not going to lie for me to the finance company which no one asked him to lie.Hes now saying i have to make the first payment with them there not at the finance company, which is different then what i was told when i signed the contract.i tried explaining to him that i was confused that they need to communicate that with the customer, I have been in contact with them and this is the first i am hearing that my payment was due yesterday??? he then gets nasty with me and i request to speak to the owner that i don't appreciate how nasty and rude he is being,he says hes both the owner and manager and hangs up on me. So I then call back and he answers and continues to be super nasty on the phone, insulting me and some. unreal to me your the owner and have no manners or customer service. I will be filing a complaint with the better bushiness bureau as well as this review. Rule of thumb, treat others how you would like to be treated, people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones,don't bite off the hand that feeds you! especially when you may need my help sometime in the future and if i give you the same treatment you might not like it so much considering my professional field, not too wise.< /review>< user>

Went out of his way to help me grab a car fr another location, and went out of his way to make sure i was able to acquire what i needed.  The experience was enhanced by the awesome support i recieved from JULIE and KIMBERLY’s service- this is a solid team that will give you honest support, to get a vehicle from their lot which has a great selection in comparison to any lot in SD you’ll explore.< /review>< pics>

<Time>1482451297459<//Time><Review>bought a car from there... first off before I start I wanna say they are a really good dealership but the thing is, they are very lazy when it comes to them doing a diagnostics on the car before selling it.. so when I first purchased my car from Karzplus 2 to 3 weeks go by, my tire blows on me so I go to the nearest shop to get a new tired.. after getting the tire fixed they gentleman had told me and said hey you know these tires are bad and already worn down? I told the mechanic wait its a new car he said true but they didn't even look at the car before selling it... then a month goes buy now I am getting my oil changed then bring it to Midas to change the oil, the guy showed me problems that were actually occurring without me even knowing.. so one of my shocks is blown and my vent where you change out the oil they had the same vent when the previous owner had the damn car.. they didn't even change or even try to attempt to work on the car...be aware before buying a car..</Review></record>

Make it run good and as soon as your warranty is up the car has all the issues you can think of! I got a "nice" impala a few  years ago and as soon as the warrantee went out the check engine light came on and I was doing all the maintenance that needed to be done the throttlebody went out the brakes were bad and a mechanic told me it had pretty much all junkyard parts. I went back to them they knew they were wrong so they offered to take that car back and put me in another car for a low down payment and add the rest of the old car note on to the new car. Here I am less than a year later come to find out the two shocks in the back or two different brands so many of my sensors are JUNK! I hate this place and they will get they're karma!! They SCAMED me just because I'm a young female!! I wish I can give them the lemon car back and get every dime I paid back  from these people.

I bought a Bad car from this company they oversell. if you check your car in the Kelley Blue Book they probably sold it for about 4,000 more than it's worth their financing sucks they have about 10 to 15 cars that are at Value auto repair that's" Value auto repair" which is the company that does there warranty work right around the corner before you buy a car go to Value auto repair and see how much cars they have in there that they're fixing that they just sold...  when I took mine in there I seen about 20 different cars that are being worked on so obviously they don't maintain they're cars. You have been warned</Text>

Terrible place. They let me out of the dealership saying I was financed and with 2000 dollars out of my pocket plus a trade in just to end up telling me I was never financed. I was making payments to them and then I told them I wasn't paid till 5 days after my bill was due and they still towed the vehicle and told me they won't let me have it back. It's a win win for them and I lost everything. Terrible people and very rude when you talk to them after the sale is finished.</text>

Waited almost 30 minutes for stamps. I felt sorry for the gentleman working in front with no help from his female coworker who was throwing boxes in the back. At least he was courteous and professional. This location definitely needs to hire more employees.<//Text>

Clerk: #3  is a rude person. Her name is covered under hair so I can't tell who exactly she is. That lady either doesn't like her job or that's just the way she is.

I don't need you to tell me how to process my mail on a single sheet. If I need every envelope to be processed separately, that simply means it is required by the system that we have where I work. If you want to give an advice, do it with a smile in a nice way lady. I don't want to see your negative emotions about the amount of mail that I need to be processed one by one.</review>

<Text>The two female customer service "window" workers that I have encounter during my Saturday visits over the last 2 months (March & April '21) must have graduated at the top of their class from the School of Rudeness and Poor Attitude. I can excuse an occasional "bad" day, but for them, one consistently falls on every Saturday.

Don't pass your distain of your job onto the customers. It's your job to serve them as best as you can. Don't like your job or don't want to do it right? Then QUIT!</Text>< pics>

<rate>1</rate><Review>Unfortunately this is the closest post office to my house. I went in there today and was screamed at by one of the managers there because I didn’t put the mail in the correct slot she was extremely disrespectful and very hostile I have never been talk to so terribly by an employee. I cannot believe she is allowed to continue working for the post office she has a terrible attitude and every time I go in there she is extremely rude to all of the customers. All of the reviews that I have read are speaking horrible about this post office I do not understand how you can continue to employ people that give you such a terrible reputation shame on you the post office I will from now on never go to this post office again.<//Review>< pics>

< Review>
Tanisha and Chrissy are very sweet and helpful every time I come in (which is about once a week). Through every busy time they remain calm and help everyone without rushing them. Only recommendation is to get more staff because it’s consistently busy and usually only 2 people working in the front< /Review>

<Text>Maybe a couple nice clerks there, but the one I delt with yesterday was full of bad attitude.  I could tell she was trying her best not to show it.  If I'm in front of the line  and her window is available, I'll let whoever is in back of me to take my place!  Sorry...I  didn't pay attention to her name but I remember her face for sure!!!< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>Our mail delivery person is so lazy. I stayed home all day to make sure I received a very important package that required an adult signature...and instead of attempting to deliver the package, they conveniently left a “sorry we missed you” sticker in my mailbox because they didn’t want to walk the extra steps to get to my front door.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80dd33751be6e4e1:0xd5651b65317e3a30</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Waited in line for 20 min since they had no  shipping envelopes out I figured I’d just ask once I got to the front. The lady said since I hadn’t filled out the envelope( that she just handed me) I had to get back in line which was already out the door again. At that point I just left.< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>All depends who is in front-  when this office was re-opened 1.5 years ago, I felt in heaven:  All the staff were not necessarily 'friendly', but PROFESSIONALS and Knowledgeable of the services.  But probably 10 months ago, I noticed a DRAMATIC Negative changed: new faces, but most of them LAZY attitude, POOR manners-- exactly as I remember the service on the USPS office on the South ST 90805.<//Text>< Pictures>

This is the closest post office by my house, the store is very clean but the lady is very disrespectful. The ladys name is Kim, she treated me very rude. If she was more kind then I would feel more comfortable going to this location but instead I avoid it because I dont want to go somewhere where I am treated bad, sucks that this store doesn't do anything about it, she might be the owner but she really needs to stop being in a bad mood<//review>

WHAT THE HELL! I don’t know why “Kim” is but the second I walked in the door it was nothing but sass and condescending comments. She should get fired for treating customers like that disgraceful and a horrible way to represent a company.< /Review>

This has got to be the rudest bunch of people I have had to deal with. No decent customer service what so ever. They really dont want to have to deal with you. I was told that I need to repackage my letter. And "its only going a couple cities over. It will be there in 2 days. What's the problem" all I wanted was it certified so that i knew it got there in a timely manner due to the sensitivity of the letter. But with no help from the staff, and already being embarrassed in front of an entire line of people I just dropped the letter in the box.<//review>

<text>It’s now $19 for a regular car wash which I think is expensive.
The truth is that they do a really great hand carwash and your car will look great!
The extra $15 for leather conditioner is well worth it because they put a lot on and it lasts.  Great place but pricey!</text>< pictures>

Hands down best car wash I have found in LA over last 4 years. I pay @ $35 for the full service (I think its a special price for repeat customers but ask). They seriously do a better job than $100 detail jobs Ive gotten at other car washes. Worth the drive and wait. Highly recommended.</Text>

<review>Really like this car wash specially because it’s 100% hand wash and they don’t use no machines. They do a good job and definitely take their time with your vehicle. Be ready to be there for a while but it’s worth the wait since they do a good job my car was filthy and they made it look like it just came out of the showroom floor and their prices are ok</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80c2c772b10cca39:0x308db8b8996a984b</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>WARNING!! Do not take your lifted truck to this carwash.  My truck has major scratches on the roof after the wash and they failed to mention this during/after the wash.  The scratches are very deep if not dented partially.

As most of lifted truck's owners, you don't check the roof after the carwash because its never the habit.  They knew about this and failed to confess their mistake.

I should file lawsuit but I can't prove it was their fault after driving away from their lot.

PLEASE BEWARE!!<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<text>I just bought a used car and I wanted to have it washed before I detailed it myself. I had read the reviews about Sam's car wash and I went anyway because it was close. I've got to be honest I was very impressed with the work they did and a hard they worked on it. $12.99 for a hand car wash including the interior is not a bad price. Make sure you bring cash if you're going to be paying with a credit card. They do charge if you want money to have as a tip for the hard workers. I went through my wallet and found $3 and I felt I had underpaid the gentleman who had done my car.
I will be a regular customer, OneNote it will be a little bit of a wait because it's not being run through a machine but done by hand.</text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

< Review>
I wish I could leave less than 1 star. I pulled into here with a brand new 2020 Kia soul. Less than a month old. Not only did they do a monumentally cruddy job, (i paid $25 and it looks just as bad as when I brought it in) but they ruined the interior of my car with some type of pink ink or grease pencil. I live less than one block from here and I took off seat covers right before I came here and there was nothing on the seats. When I got out of the car and gave the guy the keys there was nothing on the seat. When I went to get in my car there was something pink rubbed into my seat. I asked the guy he shrugged. I went inside to the owner who came out and refused to even try and get it out. He started yelling at me how I was wrong and if I would just ask him to clean it he would. So i asked him several times to please clean it and he refused, coming up with excuses everytime of how I had to ask him to do it, so I asked several more times what I needed to do for them to clean it and he just walked away telling me to call the cops. Now I'm just sitting here in the parking lot while they are closing waiting for the owner to remedy this. Save yourself the trouble don't come here. Don't give them the chance to ruin your car and not care that they took your money. This is a big city don't let these people STEAL your money.

*edit* the owner came out side and just told me, "It's lipstick. If you shut up and come back tomorrow I will fix it." I asked how he knew it was lipstick and not something else that was picked up from someone elses car on a rag or hands and then transferred to my seat when they leaned in to wipe my car down? He literally told me, " Shut up and take the offer, dont say anything else, my guys never lean on the seats." I asked to take a video of him saying that or to give it to me in writing so that when I come tomorrow he cant deny it and he walked away saying forget it dont even come back. This is no way to treat someone and run a business. Save yourself and your cars ya'll.< /Review>

<Text>Service is thorough, but the wait is killer. Dropped off my car at 8:30, was given an estimate of 1 hour. Went to grab breakfast, got back at 9:30 to find that my car hadn't even gone through the wash. Waited an additional hour for it to be done.

I'd go back because of how well the guys cleaned up the car, but only if I had a couple hours to burn.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Worse car wash I've had in a long time. Tried it out because it was always packed so i figured it would be great. Not at all, they barely do anything to your car. The wash was bad, they left the mats looking like they were when I took it in. Overall bad. Zero stars</text>

< review>
Worst car wash experience I have ever had. Car visibly dirty after wash, you could see several patches of dirt from a distance. Not only was the car not vacuumed thoroughly, but they left hand print sized stains on my passenger seat from whatever oils they used on my dashboard. As if that wasn't enough, I discovered they had left a sizable scratch on the driver's door. After going back and speaking to the owner about the incident, he said I should have checked before driving away and that he was not liable. BEWARE OF THIS CAR WASH! AWFUL EXPERIENCE AND AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE! I'd give them 0 stars if that was option.<//review>

<Text>By far the worse experience in a car wash. The person that was supposed to clean my car after the wash did a very poor job. I pay $ 25 dollars for full dressing and they just took my money and got upsad cause he got no tip. Don't spend your money at this place< /Text></record>

<Text>(Translated by Google) It is a good place to wash the car, they have an excellent cervix, the washing is very good, also the cleaning, it is a place that has a small store for products for the cars such as a small snack, they accept cash and card, it is not charges to use the card, also has chairs to wait while the car is washed

(Original)
Es un buen lugar para lavar el carro, tienen un exelente cervicio, el lavada es muy bueno, tambien la limpieza, es un lugar que cuenta con una pequeña tienda para productos para los carros como una pequeña botana, aceptan cash y tarjeta, no se cobra por usar la tarjeta, tambien cuenta con sillas para esperar mientras le lavan el carro<//Text>< pictures>

If you are dining in you can request a cup for here and they will put it in a teapot and a real cup rather than the paper travel cups. They've got great internet and if you need to do some computer stuff this is a place to be. It's a pretty crowded in pretty loud but the people are friendly and they do their best. Wait in line is usually relatively long whatever time I go there< /review>< Time>

<Text>Good coffee overall, a little pricey but so is Starbucks so it's expected unfortunately. Would be 5 stars but no coffee is worth 5 bucks a cup.<//Text>< Pictures>

The individual who served me coffee was very eager and honest to replace the coffee when it was cold.

The coffee here was surprisingly very good. This was my first Peet's so I wasn't sure what to expect.

The cashier was very helpful in helping me choose and recommending a drink.

This location had a quiet upstairs nook. The environment was really nice for reading a book or getting some work done. The WiFi was also very quick.< /text>

I love this Peets, it's my "Go To" coffee place. The staff and I have gotten to know each other (being a regular Peetnik) and they are friendly, helpful and on  some occasions, funny. They have great input and suggestions on coffees, flavors, gifts and more. Its also holiday time and I absolutely love their tea selections and latte or chai options. Thank you Peets for the love as well as consistency (which is key). Lotsa latte love.<//Review>

I love peets coffee,  but I am very disappointed on the service on this location. I ordered an iced tea with light ice. When my drink was ready I noticed the cup was 75% ice and I asked the barista to please take out some ice. The barista gave me a negative look and grabbed the cup taking out almost all the ice and gave me back less than a 1/4 filled cup and didn't want to top it off. I am not asking too much if I am paying $4 drink with light ice.  I usually don't post comments, but I am definatelly not coming back to that location. I have never received such a negative service like this, but I don't wish anyone to be treated this way.</Review>

If you want an amazing haircut that someone else normally would charge double or triple the price go here and ask for May. Go early or you will wait 1 to 2 hours to sit with may.< /review>

<Text>My son went there and had a terrible job done by Diane, the Manager, an older Vietnamese lady. My wife tried to tell her to fix it. I have no idea what Diane was thinking, but put some gel to hide the haircut. When my son took a shower, the bad haircut stood up and had a justifiable fit.
I went back to ask for a refund so I could fix with my barber. She condescendingly refused, bragging about being the manager,  and qualifications as she blamed my wife for it even when my wife is not the qualified person to cut the hair, but was just hoping to get it fixed.
She offered to come back and fix after it grows back, which I obviously rejected.
A client that was just done with May told me as he was leaving, that the older lady doesn't know and to get May. I also read and noticed that Minh was also good. So, I ordered to have them fixed by any of those two. The reluctantly agreed and had May fix. He did an awesome fix, took his time and paid attention to detail. We tipped him a little for his trouble and good job. I tried to be civil, so I said thank you to both. She ignored me.
She should just manage and let the others do the great job that they do.<//Text>< Name>

Good price for getting a haircut. If you want the best haircut go with May or Minh the only downside is theirs a long line of waiting will take like 2 hours of  wait but for me is worth it.</review>

Harbor barber use to be a place to get great haircuts for a cheap price. Not anymore. The last couple of times I have been here, I have left completely disappointed and shocked by the horrible quality of my haircut. I've been coming here for 9 years. It's strange that the service and quality of the haircuts has declined over time here. The best barbers who use to work here have left to other locations. Most of the barbers who remained are a complete joke to the profession, and they don't seem to care about the quality of their work, and they don't seem to care if they get repeat customers. Half of the barbers just stand around all day and don't do anything. Just talk on the phone or watch TV. Yet, when they get a customer they cut hair as fast and as badly as they possibly can. Seeing how some of these barbers have been here for a couple of years, the horrible quality of their haircuts can't be excused by inexperience. They cut your hair terribly on purpose, or they're really just that bad. I don't know which is worse. There's probably two good barbers left. You'll be able to tell which ones they are because everyone who comes in waits for them and only for them. If you can't tell who the good barbers are just ask someone who is waiting. Everyone else here who cuts hair is not worth the money or the headache. For those that say "you get what you pay for". There's better locations out there, who charge the same or a little bit more. Do your research and GO ANYWHERE ELSE. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED. Most of my friends stopped coming here a long time ago and started going to better places that charge more. I guess it's time to follow their lead and finally let go of this place. Like this place has let go of their quality.</Text>

Since May and Minh and Ben busy the owner Diane told me to give other barber a try. I was in a hurry and needed a haircut so I give it a shot. After i sat down I explain to this barber how I wanted my haircut. He said ok..which i assume he understand. He started to cut my hair but seem like he doesn't know what he is doing. Half way of my haircut the owner came over and take a clipper away from him and start to yell in vietnamese  and started to show him how to do . she told me that he doesn't have  experience and she is teaching him. I was so upset but have no choice to allowed both of them to finish my haircut which turn out opposite of what i asked for. When i get home i washed my hair it uneven. I have to go another place so they can fix my hair. Wasted my time and money I would not recommend this place. Its appear that she hired staff without experience and use customers for her staff to practice. I would not recommend to get haircut from this place unless you have patience to wait for May Minh or Ben.< /text>< Resp>

They know how to do fade for very short haircut. Price is inexpensive. Avoid Friday's and weekends which are very busy.< /Text>

< Review>
Great service and staff. The price is  vary competitive at $7 per haircut. You can consider this place a little filthy. They should have the staff clean their stations throughout the day and not let so much hair accumulate on the floor and  chairs. I will revise my review after progress is seen in regards to cleanliness.< /Review>

<Text>Although the price of their staple "fade" haircuts went up from $8 to $10. It is still one of the few places that dedicates around 6 barbers at all times. Busy business and awkward not being able to understand any of the barbers whom all speak the same language ( I think it's Vietnamese). Overall, the price and the results of the fades are always a bargain. I have been going to this barber for about 4 years and typically I always see a lot of people waiting but interestingly, it's usually that most are waiting for a specific barber. I am not one to be picky as my experience has always been positive with most of the barbers.<//Text></record>

I went in to get a haircut with my brother and my brother was already getting a haircut from another barber so it was my turn in line to cut my hair with the Barber Minh and he didn’t want to cut my hair because he wanted me to get my haircut with the same barber my brother was getting his haircut from. Makes no sense to tell me that if I’m paying him to cut my hair. So it was either getting my haircut with the same barber as my brother or he won’t cut my hair at all. And I didn’t do anything to get him upset SMH< /Text>

I was able to get in and out in under 20 minutes and left with a great haircut.  It still looked great after the hair grew out. I have paid 3 times as much for not as nice a job.
This place is awesome. They are usually pretty busy but the wait isn't too long. Even if the wait is more than 15 min, be patient, it'll be worth it.</text>< pics>

Absolutely disappointing experience. Went in for a haircut today and went out with less money and disappointment on my head. There are two barbers here which I'm sure if you are a local know that they are the only ones running the place as every customer waits for them, but for the other barbers they are sitting in their chair hoping for someone to want their hair cut by them. My friend and I decided to give them a chance and oh what a mistake.
In the middle of the haircut the manager begins yelling at the barber and calling out all his mistakes. She even took the machine of his hands and began salvaging what she could from my hair. On top of that she warned the barber if he were to mess up again he's FIRED. Seriously, very unprofessional, very amateur, do not be cheap, you will get what you pay for.< /Review>

<Review>Place is always packed, $8/haircut $10/skin fade. Only two barbers are good so if you want one of them to cut your hair you have to wait all day. If you don't want to wait then just go with anyone but you will have a messed up hair cut< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) Boys cut their hair well but sometimes you have to wait an hour and a half.

Los muchachos cortan bien el pelo pero hay veces que tienes que esperar hora y media.< /review>

<Text>Was in San Jose today and have been wanting to try N7 for bobas.  Quick and fast service. It's inside a shopping center so easy parking.  Liked the strawberry smoothie, you can taste the chunks of strawberries.  The watermelon cheezo was sweet, tasty and refreshing. The cheezo part was a nice touch of saltiness.  Will definitely try again when I'm down in San Jose again!</Text>< pics>

<Text>Like the other N7 Draft Tea + Coffee location in the South Bay, it's in a shopping center.

Unlike the other location (which is about half the size of this one), COVID restrictions have pushed service to just at the door. When I last visited in mid March 2021, the register was at the door and no access was allowed at all.

As far as taste and waffles are concerned, exactly like the one on Moorpark. If this is the closer one to you, definitely don't be afraid to stop by. Cannot go wrong with the House milk tea or a smoothie, I think.</Text>< pics>

Good drinks and atmosphere. Only tried Jasmine Cheese Crema and Oreo Chezzo but those drink are really good. Cheese creame is great. Does get pretty busy but they make drinks in a good amount of time 🙂<//Review>

This place was quite nice. It was to go only. There was a screen between the attendant and us. The drinks were delicious. I ordered the lemon iced tea with mango Boba. This was actually pretty delicious. I'd get this again< /review>

< Review>
Might have found my new favorite milk tea place!!! So many options, I love it. And I love that they sell milk tea and coffee even though I'm not a coffee drinker. It's nice to know the option is there. I ordered their house milk tea and it's exactly how I like it, just the right amount of sweetness. It's "nitro aasaam tea with brown sugar crema". The nitro part intrigued me. Idk what that really means but makes me feel fancy! I also love that they have smoothies and egg puffs. Will have to try next time.

The only downside is that they open at noon. Idk about y'all but I crave milk tea for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Haha. Very friendly customer service. 10/10 would recommend.<//Review>

<Rating>2<//Rating><text>I got the watermelon cheezo because it's sounds like such an unique drink. Friends got the yakult drink, the blueberry smoothie drink, and something else with jasime tea and the cheese top.

The drinks that have Jasmine tea in it aren't great. It tastes like they add Jasmine extract into the drink and it's wayyyy too floral. So the watermelon cheezo fell flat. The cheese top was pretty good but the best. Probably won't come here again.

I feel like this place may rely too much on extracts because we got plain mochi egg waffles and it was heavy on the vanilla extract as well.</text>< Pics>

Hmmm a bit hyped?
I heard the nitro was supposed to make the teas feel more creamy? And they are creamy... but not so creamy there’s an actual difference I can taste. I wouldn’t go out of my way to come here, only if I’m in the plaza, it’s the best place to go.<//Review>

I had the best experience at N7 - crafted tea / coffee.  It was my first time and the employees was great and full of personalities especially Kevin!  He was definitely attentive, knowledgeable about the menu, and very friendly.

I got the watermelon freeze drink here, and let me tell you.  This drink is truly a bliss, and very revitalizing! They use real fruits w.o any additives for their Fresh Fruits Tea which is a huge plus for me. You can literally taste the fruits in every sip. I would highly recommend this place for people looking to get bobba tea.< /Text>

<text>The Jasmine Milk Tea with boba was good, a little sour tho. Workers were friendly, however I came in with a reusable 18 oz cup for my drink to be served in, but the cashier and another worker told me that it is not possible to do that. Their reason was because they measure the drinks with their standard plastic cups. I suggested solutions, but the end result was a no. I am not sure how they use the plastic cup to measure anything bc there are no indicator lines. Also, I did see them use a mixer to measure and shake teas.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x808e33a3b5e84679:0x15a731040de8b686<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>They opened less than a week ago but I'm really impressed! I can here to get drinks for my mom and I. I ordered the Strawberry Hussel and their blueberry drink (forgot the name). Both were really good and the sweetness was perfect! The boba was cooked well too!

It's situated in the plaza where Cool Tea Bar used to be. The interior is cute and simple but appealing. The employees were nice too. They don't have their full menu up yet but that's because they're still in Soft Opening. I'll be back to try more of their menu when it's fully launched!

I do want to provide an update: I came on Friday, December 20 at about 3:45 PM. Once again, the drinks tasted great and I'm very happy with how far this places come. What I do not like is how all of the workers were eating Popeyes with their gloves on right in front of the customers view. I could literally reach over the counter and grab the food if I wanted to. It was just in plain view and it's very unsanitary. I will definitely be back here again but I hope the management sees this and does something about this because this is very unprofessional and unsanitary!< /review>< Pics>

<text>Getting into a relationship may seem like a good idea, but er.. so was getting on to Titanic and look what happened there. The only type of relationship I would have is with boba places.

.:: Dranks ::.
Great Gatsby $4.50 (+0.50 boba): nitrogen infused jasmine tea with crimson grapes.SOOOO GOOD. They use the actual fruits and its SO refreshing. Best drink I've had in a while.

Strawberry Hussle $4.50 (+0.50 lychee jelly): nitrogen infused jasmine tea with fresh strawberries. very fresh and I enjoyed the top layer of the drink which was very foamy in texture.

.:: Service/Ambiance/Parking::.
THEY ARE SOOOOO NICE. I sat by the bar area and the employees all said "thank you for waiting. thank you for your patience" And they apologized for the wait. Which I thought was considerate of them. Genuinely nice and welcoming.

The place is dim with some rustic feels to it, definitely bougie. Very loud atmosphere. Bar area was the best seat tbh.

EASY parking. Plaza full of space, no trouble parking.</text><pics>None</pics>< Rating>

N7 is currently open for their soft opening. The place is fairly busy, but the quality of customer service did not decline one bit. Their specialty is nitro tea and milk tea. While I didn't care for the gimmick, I must concede the nitro house milk tea tasted amazing, although I can't attribute that to the fact that it was due to the nitro or just because the tea was just that good. We also tried the Strawberry Hussle and found it to be pretty refreshing as well. The layout has a rustic, almost speakeasy, feel to it, however their coffee tables are too short for the stools that are provided. I plan on coming back to tried the rest of the menu in due time.</Text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Drinks in the United States are too sweet. I chose half-sugar. I didn’t expect it to be the same as the whole sugar in other stores. If you don’t like the sweetness, I would probably choose 25% sweetness. In addition, some beverage ingredients are very interesting, or. . . Avoid it.

(Original)
美國的飲料都過甜，我選擇了半糖，沒想到和其他店的全糖一樣，如果不喜歡太甜的大概要選２５％甜度。另外有些飲料配料很有趣，還是．．．避開好了。</Review>

Good middle eastern food!

Loved the baklava, order a combo plate (it will be cheaper and give you a range of food to try).

Only thing i didn't like was the owner rotated the billing machine towards me for a tip before i even got my food and it was a self service food place.<//Review>

<Rating>3<//Rating><text>Good food but can be great because i completely believe in the owners I think they are husband and wife and together I know they can accomplish the impossible. However I think the taste of the food is less ethnic and more westernized targeting white people and nothing's wrong with that. But if you're an ethnic person then you might find this place a little expensive all because the food tasted mediocre<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

I just wasted $35 and 37 minutes waiting my order get ready to go.
When I try the meat was over cooked the salad they put too much vinagre and don’t order fries isn’t crunch and the pita/bread nothing special.
The place looks decent the decorations it’s cool and they are nice but the food I can’t come back.<//text>

I had the chicken and beef shawarma combo plate.  The chicken was better than the beef, which was a little grisly.  The flavor of everything was very good though.

Update:  I went back on March 15 and had the chicken shawarma combo plate and everything tasted smoky.  Nothing was burned, but everything tasted like cigarette smoke.  I will not be going back.

Came here to introduce my boyfriend to this type of food and I saw the high ratings and had to take him here in hopes that he would enjoy his first Shawarma, and he LOVED it!

We actually shared a plate because of how big their portion sizes are! Would highly recommend this place! I would come back here next time to try their baklava!<//Text>

<text>I had the most watery pita in my life so far, it was leaking water through the pita wrap & the foil while I was eating... Plus they don’t even have forks for salad, we ended up eating with spoons 😂 I don’t hate the food but don’t think I would ever come back either.</text>< Gmap_id>

<text>Good Mediterranean food.  I like their creamy hummus and falafel sandwich.  Nice people serving and cooking.</text></record>

<review>Good food with the right quantity for lunch. Getting into their front parking spot is difficult considering the entrance is right at the merging lanes. Right price and shall visit again.

Food is little sour but if they add less vinegar/lemon then their food is going to taste even better.</review>< username>

With that said, the pita shawarma was extremely tasty. It was made with the standard mediterranean style chicken, cucumber, tomato maybe a little hummus, but lacked the yogurt I've grown accustomed to. Instead was garnished with a pickled style salad. Be sure to request hot sauce. In any case, I'll return! The lady at the register was very pretty as well....<//text><user>104593200969657829207< /user>< pics>

<text>Nice service, excellent pita. Simple and no frills. Good music and authentic folks eating late in afternoon when I arrived after 2.

I asked for a little babaganoush on the pita in addition to hummus and they did it with no problem (unlike other ridiculous, pricey hipster places in Oakland/Berkeley).< /text><Gmap_id>0x808f91544574deef:0xa9ec25608647f935<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Small counter service place, but some of the best Mediterranean food I've had in the bay area. We had the falafel sandwich plate and the veggie plate. Everything was incredibly well seasoned and perfectly cooked, and the portions were generous. I love good falafel, and this was absolutely somewhere I'll be coming back when I'm craving it.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

VERY DISAPPOINTED :*( I have been there before and i loved it..but today.. UGH.. the chicken shwarma pita was nothing but lettuce and pita.. with drizzle of garlic sauce.. no chicken in sight.. the pieces were tiny they looked like crumbs.. so basically it was bread and lettuce.. i also ordered chicken kabob plate.. chicken was sooo dry i was litterally choking on it.. I am very sad cause that place has so much potential.. the girl helping the cook was nice..but she needs to wear gloves when serving food or wrapping the pita bread.. SO DISAPPOINTED.. not going there again!<//Review>

< Review>
Delicious food and unbeatable prices! Filling gyro for $6 and dolma for $.50? YES, PLEASE! My boyfriend and I got 2 gyros and 4 dolma (we were VERY hungry and didn't know their portion sizes). I was only able to get through one gyro and one dolma. I was completely stuffed. Their menu descriptions seem sparse for their sandwiches. They are BETTER than the description in the menu. They also give you pickled green pepper slices and kalamata olives in the container with the dolma to put on your sandwich  :D
**tip: if you want delivery, order through eat 24 (which can be linked through yelp if you wish). Great option if you eat a lot of delivery and can no longer stomach pizza and chinese food.<//Review>

Would never use this place again. I asked for certain nail color and design. He said yes I would have to remove and do your nail again and I agreed he never removed anything and started add like a refill so I’m assuming he knows what he is doing. Then he asked me what color I want and I told him like I asked for for this and he said, oh I can’t do that chose a color from the book and I was like I don’t want what any color from there so I just ended choosing what ever Iook closer to what I wanted.< /review>

Today I went back to TD Nails & Spa, and was just as impressed as the first time.

I will never come here again! I was there to get my nails and toenails done. When I was waiting for someone to help me, I notice the tv was on—the Impeachment trial. I asked the gentleman that was working on me if he could change the station or put music on? The rude lady next to us working on someone else chimed in and said they would not change the station or put music on if I wanted to listen to music use my phone. Who comes to a nail spa to listen to politics? Not me!< /Text>

They do a poor job on nails, I’ve asked to get my manicure fixed that I got that same day by them and I was told no to come in 2 weeks and I can get them fixed. I went a second time for pedicures but they were rude and just sat us down with no wait time. We sat for 30-40 mins waiting till we walked out and one of the ladies working made a comment once we left. Not a good nail salon.<//Review>

NAILS NAILS NAILS |

Bakersfield in general has so many nails salons, I for one am super picky when it come to getting a manicure and pedicure.

I'm so happy I came across TD Nails & Spa.
I was a walk in (they take appointments too), luckily they got me in! The salon is spacious and they have many technicians working as well.

I went with a simple gel/shellac manicure. They had many colors to choose from and my nail tech was very honest with me when it came to picking colors and which ones were true to color. What I love best was though the salon was getting busy, all the nail techs took their time. They didn't rush at all. My nail tech in particular did an amazing job! From cutting my cuticles to the shape of my nails to painting and the massage at the end!!!
I think I found my go to nail salon!
Overall, prices and service is great!</text>

The salon was clean and used sterilized equipment in between customers. They had a big variety of nail colors and offered designs. I was particularly impressed by the manager/owner who greeted each guest and asked for feedback.

Great Place!

Great, relaxing atmosphere with chill music.  Relatively toxin free environment

Efficient and skilled nail technician.  Reasonably priced.

I would definitely recommend this place. I will definitely be coming back!< /Text>

So thankful for this nail salon! The owners are very personal and amazing people. I requested my favorite color and the owner ordered it and had it for my next visit. I would recommend TD Nails & Spa before anywhere else . Thank you to everyone who truly makes every experience amazing!!
The owner is delightful as is her staff.
I highly recommend TD Nails & Spa to everyone.</Text>

<Text>Very friendly staff! Professional as well, if you're looking for a new nail salon to try out, you won't be disappointed. They did a very well gel manicure on me and the lady that did my nails was very gentle when it came to filing off a previous color I had on.
Will definitely be back 😊

I swear by this nail shop, in fact, haven't written a review because I don't want it to get more crowded.
I love the owners and all the workers, they make you feel like part of the family. I most often get pedicures here and they always last a month, if not longer. The employees do a great job paying attention to detail and ensuring I am happy with the end result. The price is great !!<//Review>

<username>Pamela Spitzer<//username><time>1593289564483< /time><rating>1< /rating><review>I made a 12:30 appointment for a pedicure for my elderly, infirm mother and called to confirm an hour prior.

We arrived five minutes early and waited until 1:00 before asking how much longer it would be until her turn. We would told it would be 1:30 before she could be seen.

If we had known they couldn’t give her a pedicure until 1:30 we would have waited in our air conditioned home and come at 1:25.

I suspect the language barrier was a problem, but for her to wait an hour on a 104 degree day with a couple of fans in the salon was unacceptable and unprofessional.<//review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Always friendly speedy service, especially on Saturdays! I can never remember the young guy who does pedicures name, but he is fantastic and gentle for anyone with sensitive feet!! I've never found a nail salon where I felt comfortable enough to use several different techs. Normally you can only find one good one and then you are screwed if they are booked up. Not the case with TD Nails & Spa! There are other techs as well, I just have not use them yet to but I'm confident they are just as fabulous!
I'd absolutely be back if I need my nails done any time I'm in town. Great service, great staff.< /Text>

<review>I couldn't get into my usual nail place and really needed a pedicure. After reading reviews I called  and was able to get an appointment within an hour. When I arrived I was greeted by , the gentleman up from. He provided me with colors to choose from and offered me water or tea. Within minutes I was escorted back to the pedicure area.

The pedicure area was clean and sanitary. The massage chairs are comfortable and not broken like many of the nail salons I've visited. My nail tech , a very sweet young lady. She was very thorough and took her time. I wish the massage part was longer but overall, it was a nice pedicure.  checked on me throughout the service and always addressed me by name, I appreciate that. At  for a pedicure, I will definitely be back.🌾🌾🌾🌾🌾<//review>< pictures>

What a great nail salon! My decision to try this spot was based on the recommendation of a client who has fratrinised this establishment for the past decade.   I arrived as a walk in and was taken to a chair immediately. This secret designed establishment was busy, but well staffed (and the staff seemed cared for). All costumers seemed to really be into their treatments and cared for by their pros. People leaving were bid farewell by name. Very lovely experience
Do it! Good people, good vibe.</Text>

This is my third time coming here and it's an absolutely amazing place. I usually call the same day for an appointment and they always have someone there. Today, I got helped by my manicurist and she did an amazing job at doing my fill. I was a little indecisive with my color and she helped me figure out exactly what I wanted from a picture I showed her. We had great conversation. She's got plenty of experience and I'll be asking for her from now on!<//review>

Very nice atmosphere. All the owners are nice and courteous. They have nice chairs for pedicures. I would definitely make this a regular nail shop to visit. The can accommodate almost any requests, nail shape and color.<//Text>

My husband and I visited this nail salon this afternoon on a whim and we had a wonderful time! They got us in right away and we were only there for about 45 minutes total. We were able to each get a Deluxe Pedicure at the same time ($35 each) and they did a great job. It was my husbands first pedicure and the woman who did his feet really took her time to get his feet into shape. We were offered full-sized water bottles and I was offered actual flip flops to wear home (not the paper ones). This place is quick, no frills but gives you what you want in a good time-frame, and nice! They didn't sit and talk in their native languages the whole time, but actually spoke to us and we all had a good laugh at my husband enjoying his first pedicure.<//Text>

<Text>So very discriminatory and disrespectful I came in for a Pedicure and was left sitting at the foot chair for an 1/2 hour no one spoke to me no one gave me a time. I honestly am just visiting and needed a pedicure but I will never and I hope the local women NEVER clearly they don't  service  patrons with brown skin i.e. all of the photos they have of previous service. That's fine with me all of their photos of their outdated ugly dry nail designs 😂😂😂😂 tell me everything I need to know.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Date>1570034342730< /Date><Text>I've been coming here for over a year now and refuse to go anywhere else. Every single one of the workers are great. My gel nails stay on for 4 weeks (would last longer but they are grown out and too long so I come in to have my nails done.) I always get gel nails. Make an appointment because they do get busy, and plan on being here for at least an hour even with appointment as sometimes they have a bit of a wait. Worth it! These are my real nails with shellac on them.< /Text><Response>None< /Response></record>

This place is clean and they do a good job on nails, BUT I am absolutely fed up with the timing of their clients. This is the 4th and last time I will be told/given a time and STILL having to wait around 1 hour to get started. Today I came in at 4:30pm and they told me to xome back at 6:30pm...the waiting area is filled with people waiting and I still done. aited an hour to get them done. I'm not coming back anymore.< /Review>

Make an appointment! Don't be in a hurry. They are friendly and make sure you are comfortable. I only get full set work done. I don't know how pedicures are. I don't get them.</text>

<Review>Been here twice and  the owner makes me wait so long. Once I get in the chair he goes off in the back or to do something on someone’s nails. The second time I came made me realize he’s just mad when I come in. I will never know why. He raised the price that was listed in their menu as soon as I told him what I wanted and pointed to it. Then he disappeared for nearly 10 minutes. I got the hint and just left NEVER AGAIN.<//Review>< Name>

I made an appointment same day 2 & a half hours before we were going and it was super easy to get ahold of them and to schedule the appointment. We had a party of 5 for pedicures and two acrylic nail sets, we arrived 35 minutes early and they took us almost as soon as we got there no problems. The owners were amazing, very nice and helpful and treated us like special guests. Everyone was very satisfied with what they got in our group. Will definitely go back if I'm in the area again!!<//Review>< Pictures>

This is my new Bakersfield nail salon! I love this place. This place and all their equipment is new. It's bright and clean inside which I love. I got there 30 minutes before closing and they took me in and were friendly about it. The mani pedi was awesome, one of the best I've had. My toes and feet looked fabulous even before he put the polish on and that says a lot. They do a very thorough job and my hands and feet look great.< /review>

<Text>CD Nails & Spa gave me a wonderful mani and pedi experience for my wedding. Not only were they friendly, they were impressively skilled. The nail technician who did my pedicure was very thorough with the clippers. The nail tech on my hands created  a lovely floral designed from a vague description of what I wanted, asking me questions and making small changes when needed. Best of all, the price was nearly half of what I paid at another area salon that CD Nails & Spa far surpassed in service and  skill. In short, go get your nails done! You'll leave happy.</Text>< pics>

<review>I waited an hr to get my nails and it ended being a waste. A guy started to put fake nails and most of the nails were facing in a crooked direction. Then one was really crooked and i told him about that one. He said he'd fix it. And i thought ok. Then i told him its not only one that is crooked, there's more. He said that my fingers are crooked. And i have had my nails done before so i know that my nails should not be looking like that. He proceeded to get the powder out to start application. I walked out.

That upset me. He needed to take off the fake nail and correct it or else he is just adding on to the problem and addressing it. So i left. Also he did not like that i pointed out his mistake. He is in a customer service businessandshould learn to do what customer wants esp when customer is paying.< /review>< pictures>

I have found that the owner and nail tech Holly are very unprofessional. The hours of operation sign on the door states that they are open from 9-7 and they don't arrive until 9:25 or later. Nail tech Holly doesn't arrive until 10 or later. I scheduled an appt with her for 9:30 and I left at 9:50 bcuz she never showed up. Clients including their employees are usually sitting outside of the business waiting for them to show up.I wouldn't recommend them at all.< /review>

Roaches and bad service. If you wanna wait 4 hours to be over charged and given a bad nail job go here.

Also they have roaches behind the nail polish display case, and I saw a big one dead in the pedicure pool.

So nasty, and rude.</Text>

Ill never go back! French tip is an easy common request I thought would be get in and get out. The lady was rude from the start. I asked how long for pedicure since I was pressed on time. They said 5 minutes it was really 20. I let it go. Had my son get picked up by his dad it took so long. The French tip looked crooked and awful. And I kept insinuating my unhappiness with the French tip. They looked crooked and very thick. I don't know why poeple work at nail salons but don't really have the proper skills. When I got up I told the lady I was just going to pay her and not go back because she seemed rude even though  the lady next to me even pointed out how bad they looked. She tried to kind of push me to sit down that's when I told her to not touch me in that way. Very rude custom of people . This was my go to spot since solar nails is always packed. But I'll never step foot in here again<//text>

So I asked again and the lady got mad at me i said you know what Ill go somewhere else. Than she said no no sit ill fix it. Than as I made my payment the guy got mad at me for paying half card and half cash. This place is a joke never again. Dont go here save the trouble and go to Solor Nails.<//Text>< pics>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>My experience at this place was the worst first experience ever. First off, my customer service was awful. I went in knowing exactly what I wanted and this man told me no. That it was too expensive. And I said it's fine and he demanded that I get the shape I did not want for less money. Next once I accepted the fact that he would not listen to me he exclaimed that I choose my nail color as any other place, but I wanted matte and he said that it would cost 5$ extra which was fine and he denied me that option as well! I was so confused and furious. Then this man shows me there electricity bill sayin how expensive things were. It was very uncomfortable . The whole experience was awful he didn't efficiently clean my hands or under the nails when finished. And the place seemed unsanitary as well<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>It was an amazing weekend in Napa. We are celebrating our 25 th wedding anniversary and thought of wine and dine date in Napa. The location of the hotel is topnotch. Walks away from bars and restaurants. No driving and get drunken. Ehemmm. Drink responsibly. The staff are friendly and excellent. Notes was John who checked us in. Allowed us yo park our car for about 30 minutes as we settle in our room. Very helpful in directions and cares for our needs. We were upgraded to a junior suite which was sweet making our anniversary well romantic. The surprise of our stay was the breakfast at the hotel. Coffee was excellent. Order the ham sandwich with egg on the famous model bakery english muffin. You got it right Oprah!!!  My wife had the French toast with fruit compote which was so delicious. Rave about it. The room. The best was good to excellent . Pillows ok but less puffy. Linens are immaculately clean. Towels are great and very very good quality. The bathroom fixtures are just modern and chic and may i add very functional. The quality of water was good. Not hard water. Room temperature as always was set to maximum coolness of 65 defrees. Could be better if it were 60 degrees , we used at cool bay area temp. We could hear a bit annoying noise of the fan motor, could be improved. Large television and good channel selections and options. Felt safe. Convenient to shop, dine and drink around. Would definitely come back and spread the word to think it is still Covid season.</Review>< Pictures>

Fantastic service and the Jewel (maybe Jule) was so helpful! We were welcomed with a small gift bag (a to go wine glass and coupons for tastings and bottle of water) and two glasses of wine.  She even gave us a refill when we asked what the name of the wine was since we really liked it. She upgraded us to a suite and gave us pointers for things around town. Hotel is really nice with live music in the evening and a lobby bar with great cocktails. The outdoor patio area was closed due to rain but looked like they have a fire pit. Breakfast restaurant was fantastic and they accommodated our vegan diet with a customized fruit bowl and avocado toast. The room was spacious with a fireplace and soaking tub. They also have some snacks and sodas/juice complimentary.  They will even give you an extra bottle of water if you ask. We would absolutely stay here again. Andaz staff made us feel so welcomed! Thank you!<//text>

<Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x8085065d46d1913b:0x3efb561f7b7e36fe< /GmapID><Text>The hotel itself is decent. Front desk guys were great but I tried to dine in with my sister for breakfast and was rudely told I was not welcomed by Barbara. Barbara told us “To go back to where we started” ?? Like huh? I’m dining in like the rest of the guest I would like to order off the menu and pay for my meal like the other guest. Barbara was very adamant about us not dining in. I felt like i was back in the 1950s where colored people are not allowed to sit down. I couldn’t believe it. So if you are in town visiting, spending your hard earned money like everyone else, do not visit this hotel Barbara will totally ruin a wet dream. She does not like people of color, I’m curious what “Go back to where you started” meant for her, in her mind. She needs to be removed from this establishment in 2021 that kind of attitude and mindset is not tolerated.</Text><Date>1621093681570</Date>< name>

<text>We had a great experience at Andaz. Very cleanly and modern, everyone at the hotel was super kind & warm hearted. The beds/pillows were another level of comfort. Everyone in our group had a great night rest when we were there. Loved the marble shower & the view outside during sunrise was heavenly. Highly recommend!< /text><user_id>102220144264639436978</user_id><time>1609574439153<//time><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVRcXlTCmysVUClK1nkTn38Ifvd0petcat4xTk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><resp>None<//resp><user_name>Sheeva Shahinfar</user_name>< Rating>

Positive: The hotel itself was very nice, loved the modern art and look/feel of Andaz. The location was ideal. They were very accommodating when there were issues with reservation. Negative: A bit overpriced for what it is.<//Text>

Location is great but that's about it.

This hotel definitely does not live up to it's 4 stars. We booked a junior suite for 2 nights and the stay didn't feel special at all. We didn't get any welcome wine, instead they kept 2 cans of wine in the fridge ( and didn't mention that to us). BTW they left plastic cups in the room to drink that wine, not proper wine glasses which is a joke in Napa Valley. No complimentary minibar, they give $10 credit towards snacks. No water bottles in the room either. No toothbrush/toothpaste.. which is generally a standard. No bathrobes. No room service since we stayed only 2 nights. Hotel will service your room only if you stay more than 3 nights. Only 1 disposable coffee cup kept in the room. It felt like we will have to call them for absolutely everything.

Total lack of attention to detail. Even the bathtub in our room was crooked. Carpet under the bed was stained and dirty.

Not worth it at all.<//Text>

Loud rooms, rattling AC, and poor ventilation if the AC is off. When asked for a quieter room, they gave me one that was actually louder and had not been cleaned. At that point, I just decided to stay the night and never return.<//Text>

<review>Located in the center of Napa downtown. Accessible to many good restaurant and wineries.

Greate interior with modern design. Clean and feel nice.

My room had great view to the bar at second floor.

Room service was responsive and fast. They took care our needs for extra coffee, hot water, and late checkout request.<//review>< Pictures>

<Rate>4</Rate><review>This hotel sits in center of downtown Napa, which is in walking distance to everything downtown. Great furnished room and we like the shower head, it’s amazing. We strongly recommended the junior suite, the bathtub is make the experience into another fantastic level. Not to mention the staff is hospitalized and really helpful.
Some small pities. 1. Not every room have a view, our room is in a corner of the building which face another building’s wall. 2. The complimentary bottle of wine is downgraded into canned wine now during covid. 3. There was some noise came from hallway. So we decide to cut one star.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Our stay was nice, and the staff was more than pleasant. We had paid extra for a room that had a bathtub in the photos, but there was no bathtub when we checked in. We asked if there was a room available and had to pay extra to upgrade to a room with a soaking tub. We had to call down twice or more to get items we requested like bathrobes and water. Also, our tub had an external wand that didn’t work, but leaked everywhere. The tub sits on tile so the leaking can lead way to slipping if you’re not careful. I’d definitely request extra towels next time to lay around the tub just in case.< /review>

<text>Gorgeous hotel, with amazing staff.
The decor is second to none... I'm so glad we found this hotel, as we were planning on staying at a Marriott as we are Marriott members.... but this hotel has me thinking about changing to Hyatt.
Each and every staff member so far have been amazingly helpful and friendly.
We have not eaten here, but if we do I will update this review.
You can see by the pictures that the style is all over,  even the elevators are finished beautifully.
This hotel should definitely be on your go to list if in Napa.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPco4j6yTh96b8IvSFnxDa6UcLypDYQpEWsWEDS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3tJ7Pd1D2A4XUYXYEo1Gn-2EDDTfbrmcRkgGD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnUEXi-8YCmJZqmZ75HEFll31WA55vM5IHfjls=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJnD8_XzHLQmJ90ybaBJmlW6SXuNpiRbUqaRW3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMsPEhykrxwEnCZ9wwT5h5iCjjCHP3u08nfFw2p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2jKpdL5Ne9-rTIAOnuyyGHcE3dGoVPAkQxvV1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnn7nR6hoGjJmWNMVU0j_EghaNiXcgoVHZSQ4S=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6cfw5yE6dKlRwVk9oXa3EE9xNSQLL3kpJWau9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_dvFK5hyQ71Gm_2ipnjCOMEbCi2XiRK3WdlFU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGRPDu2QI2v5iXrr12-58BntsCLM265DZnSeTX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqJfH77HR1YiDI3MHlkSDtWaUaIk12ENmlem9P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMyAn0U7IKdWARiM13_yJz9CwuhOzf1ypsJHuiB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXSWlppTGyTtSWfennv2TKjFsPWqlkgLn589p8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7u1xmU_X5NqX8Y7eRxE-74wNnYBXtt1eDPDug=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhPzubDUyFAPh9KMIBWX5dkREEO2nEmUvBhXHT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><response>{'time': 1570116708553, 'text': "Hey there Deckie!

Fast check-in with a nice welcome drink (wine) and check-out was faster! Food was okay. Bath tub was huge. Fitness centre was located out side the building. Beds were getting replaced across most rooms in the hotel which was a bit inconvenient as the lift was held up for this purpose. Staff need more training to handle visitors from diverse backgrounds.</review>

Had an amazing time! My room was spacious and the bed was unbelievably comfortable. The shower knobs were tricky, but chalked it up to user stupidity. Customer service was fantastic! The hotel is perfectly situated so it's a simple and pleasant walk to shops and restaurants.</Text>

Nice boutique hotel. Small and so it doesn't have a lot of amenities at the hotel. The location is great where you can walk to many restaurants and wine rooms right next door. Breakfast area with a big fireplace is nice.< /Text>

Really nice room. The parking is in a back parking lot on the 2nd and 3rd floor for $20. Everything was very clean. Bathroom was large.</review>

This used to be a nice place to stay, Now its old and very noisy rooms. Poor customer service. Way over priced compared to the newer nicer hotels close by. I stay in the area frequently for work. I booked several days at a new hotel next door and will share that review to be fair. P.S. I was never offered a glass of wine they advertise upon check in.<//review>

This is lovely!! We made a last minute decision to drive from San Francisco to napa valley . Most of the 5 stars hotels were booked out so we felt lucky to find a place at Andaz. The location is in the heart of Napa town. The concierge is really helpful recommending Michelin star restaurants, vineyards, wineries. Very friendly and helpful staff.

We had a suite . The hotel is fairly new, very clean, good workmanship. Good size bath room with white marble floors, walls. Very modern design .

Even though it's a 4 star hotel, I give it ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️👍🏻👍🏻😘<//Text>

Rooms are large, extremely comfortable and include a mini refrigerator, walk in showers and more. We were greeted with a glass of wine complementing other offerings including and outdoor patio with a fire pit. Would be happy to return to this excellent hotel in the middle of Napa!< /Review>< Pics>

<review>This hotel is located in a great area of downtown Napa! Beautifully decorated inside any out - I'm in love with the decor and feel of this place, farm-style rustic with contemporary elegant amenities. It's very warm, inviting, friendly, and intimate - I love the vibe and the bar in the lobby!

We were greeted with a complimentary glass of delicious red wine and advised that all non alcoholic snacks in the room were complimentary - wonderful touch. The upgraded suite we booked was lovely - separate living room area with a balcony, fridge, TV, and dual sided fireplace. The bedroom had a super soft and comfortable King bed, large soaker tub, and large shower with rain shower head. Loved the mercantile outdoor patio and bar - cozy, outdoor fire, and plenty of seating.

Breakfast in the hotels restaurant - Farmers Table - was delicious. Loved the Brioche French Toast - my only complaint is I wished they included more than 4 because it was a tease... So delicious with just the whip cream. My hubby had the carnivore omlette​ and loved it, I ate some of his potatoes and it was seasoned and cooked perfectly!

Five stars is my rating for this gem in downtown Napa! We'll definitely stay here when we make it back to Napa!< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOaG6u5Z7bHZASFJDM7r1XWuewUf-b6s_uZa9RT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEiNwoj50JXScYTUwQl4uKSOb_piIbJuPmEaue=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEkfpS1cd1qLZ_BRA0zgEb9dVVCXWuTfkNFhdt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7mnyz6kck4iTAKAsqJJilxqsgrdraYpwLoGOY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqMvcgNMegy43d3LVRKglqtiDN1pcda-FVyCdx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvf4nkj5HslE1uglIZv8k9zImOX5U3Y5HwSkSV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFr50meXlwlEMx5huuI6kOsuscm-olE8Z41q7s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOP7rDZOR8WLJS2mVX--FpVqOhmHnN41kxMpHks=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSLsd69iRWXfo4dBMBhrv5UhxOGRi3_RJ4bo0j=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3ivowIXnLB1Q-EfJHRnTQohazStcJg2EWGjL-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpN9YUddmrTo_Wq266IKMUpUOlWcjU2g66brmf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNR1BcddlFS8J3VCV-Q5blF-qEMZOlyVIK1q5dA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODI3tIDDn9oMjA3zUzm8-6rtxg6jOcwji_Zvl7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-d--sq7nh7bkMQCdq6DmwzxwUUvdjMd9OOFWS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

<Text>Mediocre outdated rooms. Total lack of clarity about pricing. Website says parking is free even though it is not. Room itself OK but sofa was stained and gross looking - no drinks or snacks in room (not even water). Basic updates need to be done (outlets, paint etc). Hotel offers paltry $10 credit per day for snack bar but prices are so high it’s almost a joke. I stayed in a suite that didn’t feel very special. When I walked in to the hotel after a long drive to Napa, the customary free drink was not offered to me. I had to ask for it. The guy at front desk didn’t walk me through how to get to parking garage, which is a block or so behind the hotel. Poor guest services through and through. Considering the hotel has fewer guests due to pandemic I would actually expect far better, more personal service. I wouldn’t spend my money here again.< /Text></record>

Nice clean hotel with spacious rooms. Few cosmetic issues in the rooms but large bathroom with huge soaking tub. The lobby is nice and open with a small convince stand and bar. Breakfast restaurant is nice but very very slow. Average quality food. Great location in Napa.< /review>

<Text>We stayed here because they have a chain in Tokyo. Clean, large bathrooms and comfortable large beds. Amenities like comfy slippers, coffee machine, fruit (at reception), toilet amenities, etc are available which is good for a US hotel (note this is standard for Asian 5* hotels). Friendly and generally attentive service, incl reception and the room service guy (he was very good but we couldn’t find him after). Room was facing street but was not noisy, though the fan / heating was a bit noisy. Cool bar with open fire which is busy in the evenings but not over crowded<//Text>< Rate>

We enjoyed a very good meal here that included shortribs w/ risotto and moussaka. The bottle of blended wine from South Africa was delicious.</Review>

Nice hotel but when we got to the room, there was an open soda can in our fridge. My wife and I came to an expensive hotel so we wouldn’t have to worry about dirty things. Probably an honest mistake, but it did put a bad taste in our mouth. Wonder what else was “cleaned” or not before we checked in. Sorry hyatt! You guys dropped the ball on this one.<//review>

This place is supposed to be one of the best places in Napa. Not so sure. I know there is the covid thing going on, but I booked a room with a balcony, a fireplace and dual sinks in the bathroom, but our room had none. When I asked the clerk at the front desk about changing rooms,  he said it would be an additional charge. But with my Hyatt rewards I should be upgraded if the room is available. Hmm?? OK, Whatever. I selected this place over The Archer Hotel, which is down the street. Well I should have gone there. For the same price I would of had a much nicer room with a fireplace, balcony, room service a restaurant in my hotel, bell service, valet service. Not what I expect from a level 6 Hyatt. Oh and I called ahead and told them it was my husband and my 25th anniversary. Guess what they did for that? Nothing! That's right, didn't even mention it. Not impressed.< /text>

Great location to walk to restaurants and shops.  Clean and modern.  Great 2nd floor outdoor bar.  Staff was friendly. Convenient free parking on the third floor in the ramp behind the hotel. Even the alley behind is nice.</Text>

Beautiful rooms, views were amazing! Make sure to visit the rooftop terrace bar. Plenty of sitting up there, so peaceful with the wide open outdoor setting. Fire pits are an added bonus, to enjoy a glass of Merlot or Chardonnay with your companion. Farmers table, the hotel restaurant, friendly atmosphere offering local and traditional dishes, taste and presentation can most definitely be found here.</Review>

When we decided were to stay in Napa for a weekend getaway and this hotel seemed like the perfect location to all the local restaurants, tasting rooms, and local events. The parking is located at the back of the hotel at a public parking garage. If you stay at the hotel just park on the 3rd floor for your overnight stay.

The hotel booking, the onsite communication, check in/check out processes were all so easy and seamless. We had reserved the king bed city view room and were on the 2nd floor right around the corner where the Mercantile Terrace was located. We unfortunately did not get to enjoy the terrace area during our stay, but the area looked really nice and was lively throughout the evening.

The room itself was big, the bathroom was huge, with a rainfall shower, plenty of counter space and amazing marble floors and shower walls.

They offered complimentary beverages (non-alcoholic) and snacks (which were refilled daily). We also had ordered room service breakfast and the order was up and in our room within 20-30mins. The food was also delicious.

All in all, we enjoyed our stay at Andaz and hope to come back in the future.< /Text>

The rooms were wonderful - so beautiful, felt newly remodeled and very clean. Would highly recommend!< /text>

Love, love, love this place!  We stayed at the Andaz (and eloped!), and had a wonderful experience from the moment we walked in the door.  The hotel is clean and inviting. The location is so convenient and fun. Our room was perfect, especially for the occasion. We will never stay anywhere else when we visit Napa. Just hope everyone doesn't discover this gem making it more difficult to get a room on our next visit!  Special shoutout to Alex...  THANK YOU FOR MAKING US FEEL SO SPECIAL!< /text>

We loved this spot in downtown Napa. We had a room with a balcony and it was a wonderful place to ride out the pandemic.</Text>

<Date>1534558035982<//Date><Rating>4< /Rating><text>This property is very cozy and comfortable, while rooms are sleek and updated. The staff is extremely friendly and attentive, along with being knowledgeable about the area. The rooms are spacious and bathrooms are beautiful. I would have rated five stars if the AC in the room wasn't so loud and the service in the restaurant was quicker. Meeting rooms are nice, outdoor patio is very accessible and I loved the fireplace out there. This hotel is within walking distance of a lot of shops and restaurants. Overall I had a great experience and would definitely recommend/stay again. (And you get a free glass of wine at check-in)< /text>< pics>

It is really disappointing to see that the Napa Andaz isn't doing what a hotel of their caliber should be doing to take care of the health and safety of their guests.  It makes me leary of going to both Napa and the Andaz as I didn't feel safe here during our last stay.< /Review><gmapID>0x8085065d46d1913b:0x3efb561f7b7e36fe</gmapID><response>None</response></record></dataset><record>

I really enjoyed my stay here. The staff was very friendly, the room was nice, and the service was great. I was disappointed to see that I was charged an extra $69 in "destination fees" after my 2 night stay was complete. Instead of including this fee in the original price when I made my booking the month before, it was added on after I completed my stay. This is a dishonest approach that tries to make it seem you are getting a better price staying with their hotel compared to other hotels in the area, only to surprise you with additional fees after checking out.< /Review>

Its been a very long time coming writing my review at the Andaz in Napa but I needed to express my experience.

This last Summer (2018) I had the delight of staying at the Andaz Napa. The room, the vibe of the hotel, the amenities and services were by far the greatest I have experienced at any Hotel. I do a lot of traveling for work so i do know a little about Hotels.

This trip however was for leisure, I had the pleasure of proposing to my fiancee the week I stayed here and to say the staff was more than helpful is a huge understatement. They pointed us in the right direction of some awesome wineries, gave us dinner recommendations and upgraded our room mid stay. They had also added a complimentary bottle to celebrate our engagement.

I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone who wants to stay in the area. Wish I could give a higher review but sadly it is not possible.<//Text>

When you pay $400+/night you really expect more. We requested an early check in for the morning, but our room wasn't ready for us until after check-in time at 5pm. Despite their promise that we could check in before 12, our room hadn't even been cleaned. The staff were not available (no concierge or reception at all times during the day) to assist us, and when they were available, they weren't making much of an effort to be welcoming or accommodating. The room was clean, but very spartan and not at all welcoming. In addition, I saw another guest's cats and luggage being brought up, and the carryon suitcases were placed on top of the cats. My cat was housed elsewhere, since I didn't want to risk him having an accident in a luggage cart! I was disappointed by my visit to this location. I enjoy Napa very much, but this hotel doesn't do the city and the culture of Napa Valley justice.<//text>

Really like this hotel, looking forward to when the rest of the neighborhood gets built up as well.  Wish the public parking was a little more intuitive, I think it's OK but could use more signage or reserve more floors for hotel guests in the garage behind the hotel.  The service has always been fabulous here.  My wife and I were recently here for Thanksgiving and we really loved it.  The rooms have a lot of natural light and the hotel overall is very modern.</text>

<Review>Nice place for a couple, not so much for a family with two toddler tagging along. It's honeymoon, vacation for two type hotel. Oh, the parking isn't so convenient, you have to use a garage, but it is free if you're a hotel guess. It's not your typical, parking in front type of hotel. Hopefully, this is informative.< /Review>< GmapID>

The phone in the room couldnt be used because "the battery" was dead. Called room service 4 times over a span of 20 minutes to get food, and no one answered.
It appeared that they were always out of stuff.
So, as a person who travels all over the world, this was by far a very disappointing time.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Simply a lovely hotel. The spa is state of the art. We didn’t want to leave honestly. The accommodations are clean and stylish. Not the cookie cutter style hotel. It’s impressive to say the least. We would love to live here!

Our anniversary is in July so already planning a trip back. Thank you to Francois as well.< /Review>

Loved it! Great location. Well-appointed, comfortable, spacious rooms. Warm atmosphere. Excellent service (shout out to Michaela). The only downside was an overly sensitive, noisy HVAC system in meeting and lodging space. But it was easily turned off.</Review>

<Rate>3<//Rate><Review>Our stay at this hotel was pleasant. Bathroom was clean and pressure was good. Some things may need upgrades, but everything seemed to be working. There was also a fireplace in the room.

Hyatt has microfiber slippers available.

The only weird thing about the hotel was the way the water drains or pumps back up. You can definitely hear it when you use the tub next to the bed.

Not sure what other people were saying, but they charged $10 to park overnight at the Clay garage behind the hotel.

Andaz Napa offers valet parking at $27 per day and self-parking at $10 per day. Self-parking is located in the Clay Street Garage, directly behind the hotel.<//Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x8085065d46d1913b:0x3efb561f7b7e36fe<//gmapID></record>

Because of a medical condition we had to cancel a reservation we made 48 hours prior (cancelling a little more than 24 hours before). The hotel stated that I would have had to cancel 7 days prior...which was obviously impossible. Booked directly with them using our rewards and not through a 3rd party service. BEWARE OF THIS PLACE. They make it impossible to be a human and could not care less. Will NOT book with the Hyatt again or their affiliates. I would expect better being a consistent traveler using their hotels.< /review>

<text>The hotel was beautiful. Lovely outdoor patio. However, walls and doors are thin. They actually leave ear plugs on the night stand.

No complaints at all. I was a guest for one night at this property, and everything was great! From the complimentary glass of wine at check-in to the friendly barista who served me coffee on the morning I left, the hotel was wonderful. The room I stayed in on the fourth floor was large, well laid out, and comfortable. I didn't eat here or order room service, so I can't speak to the food. I'd definitely return if I'm looking to stay in the area.<//Review>

This hotel is SO great! Super easy to get an Uber/Lyft to wineries in the area with its central location and within walking distance of great restaurants. The staff is so friendly and helpful. Rooms are to die for— the standard suites are very spacious with an even more spacious tub, and their double King bed rooms are great for families. Breakfast at the Farmers Table is great and their freshly squeezed orange juice is a must. Literally nothing negative I can conjure up about this place.  We’ll be back!!</Text>

We loved our stay at the Andaz. It's only about 4 blocks from the city center of Napa, with free parking right behind the hotel which saved us the valet parking fee. Chic hotel with a bar that was banging all the time, multiple food locations attached or nearby, tray of cookies in the lobby, and really friendly staff. Our room was GORGEOUS with a bathtub next to the bed (complete with complimentary bath salts!), a sitting area, and a TV that could swing from the sitting area to the bed area (why haven't more places thought of this?!). The free snacks and drinks were a big plus too on our days of wine tastings. My favorite thing of the whole place, though, was the bed. I have slept in a LOT of hotels and this bed was by far the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in. Soft sheets, perfect mattress... we never wanted to get up. I would say the only downside to the Andaz was that there's no pool. But overall I'd recommend in a heartbeat.<//text>

<Review>My husband and I had an amazing experience and time at Andaz Napa. The service was exceptional, we enjoyed the hotel bar Mercantile Social, and the restaurant Farmers Table was so good we spent multiple mornings there! (The Cali omelette with pesto and goat cheese-add chicken apple sausage!) The Hotel was within walking distance to many restaurants, coffee shop, wineries, the location couldn’t be more perfect. Highly recommend!<//Review>< pics>

This is a great hotel & right in the middle of downtown Napa.  There's a small bar at the lobby & Farm Table restaurant in the back of the lobby.  There's also a great outdoor terrace were you can sit by a couple fire pits with others or tuck back into one of the small romantic niches with heat lamps.  I told them it was my birthday & they upgraded our room to a huge suite.  Everyone that worked here was very nice, helpful, & laid back.  Deffenantly going back here the next time we're in Napa.<//Text>

< Review>
Unique hotel with a lot of wood and interesting designs to it. Very clean. We were upgraded to a beautiful studio with wood floors and a king bed. They have an adorable terrace to enjoy some wine on. Valet parking only, so make sure you order your car ten minutes ahead or you'll be waiting. The hotel is in a great location with tons of delicious restaurants in walking distance.</Review>

Gorgeous, unique bar setting. Loved the speciality drinks and wine (of course). Live music and for pit was so much fun. (Not to mention nice, clean bathrooms!)</Text>

Awesome friendly and helpful staff.  We got to check in early, and complimentary glasses of wine were offered at check in.  The room was perfect and the bathroom was beautiful.  Snacks and non alcoholic drinks in the room were complimentary as well.  The lobby has a great little bar with a cozy atmosphere for relaxing after a long day and listening to live music.  This will be our go to place in Napa from now on.<//text>

Good service, but bad attention to detail. Called ahead and asked for a crib and freezer. I guess no one passed on the memo. Other than that, it's a nice place.<//Text>

Quaint hotel on the main drag in Napa.  We completed on-line check in, so when we arrived we were promptly greeted, got our room key, and were surprised to get a complimentary  glass of wine.  The rooms were comfortable and nicely decorated.  Staff was friendly and responsive.  The lobby is cozy, but lively! Highly recommend!</text>

The hotel was great. Very pleasant interior and staff. I loved the room. Very nice wood floors, the bathroom had a large shower with a stool and 2 shower heads, and I had a little area for seating. The hotel also has some nice social areas. There is a terrace area with a fire pit and bar. I would definitely recommend!< /text>

<text>My husband and I stayed at the AVIA Napa for our ten year anniversary trip. The staff was friendly, helpful and knowlegable about the area, which was appreciated as this was our first visit to Napa and wine country. We stayed in one of the junior suites and it was clean, comfortable and beautifully decorated. The revolving TV was awesome! I liked the fact that this hotel was small because it made for a more personal experience, and some of the staff even remembered our names. It didnt have every amenity (if youre looking for a pool, you should stay somewhere else), but the excersice facility they partner with next door was more than adequate. We would definitely stay at the AVIA again!< /text>< pics>

Great hotel in downtown Napa.  A few blocks from the main Street.  Staff were friendly. Rooms were clean and modern.
Things for improvement. The bed is a little too soft.< /text>

There are ***y areas within walking distance for dinner and shopping. Every time we stay here, the service is top notch and the employees are very nice. The days were sunny with just a slight breeze and our balcony made the room incredible. Highly recommend this central location for any trip to the Napa Valley.</Review>

A very nice hotel; with the coolness and the boutique aspects one associated with the Andaz name now. The room was spacious; staff nice; location at the beginning of downtown Napa convenient. Free parking just behind the hotel is also cool! One issue : it's surprisingly noisy. I guess they know that as the earplugs are located next to the bed but both noise from the street and from the hotel (walls and doors are too thin for this level hotel) are a little disappointing.< /Text>

<review>Used to live in Napa Valley, so family trips are mix of couples activities and kid activities as they enjoy returning to their old stomping grounds annually. The location is perfect since it is physically sitting in Napa downtown. You can walk to the riverfront and the oxbow public market. Definitely worth a try if you are staying in Napa.</review><UserId.>None< /UserId.><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

And was great. We went for a few drinks at the terrace bar they have. The ambiance they've created being that it's outside feels good. Definitely would return.</text>

<Text>Two horrible experiences and one bad one at this place. First time Valet somehow lost my gym bag from the trunk of my car! No one EVER had permission to go in there! Only time I ever saw management in person was when I reported this first situation and all she did was come out to assure me nothing had been lost there before 😂 that it was surely my mistake. They called for me to pick up my bag days later and was at the front desk but she never showed her face again. She never responded to my emails asking for an explanation. Second time (wasnt by choice that I went back) valet lost my brand new cars key fob!! My BMW was literally 2 days old when this happened. Third situation I was handed someone else's car and I drove off in it, didnt realize it till I was out of town. This I confirmed happening to 2 other people I personally know!! Partly my fault but come on! Every time management was nowhere and every thing was relayed through other staff including valets. NEVER got a proper apology from management with any of the 3 situations I experienced there. She avoids showing her face at all cost! I will never recomend this place until proper management has been implemented. If anyone needs any further details on any of my 3 experiences there feel free to contact me.
P.s. The twins who valet there have never been involved in any of my bad experiences and were great everytime I've been there.< /Text>< Pics>

PROS:. phenomenal location walking distance to just about everything within the town of Napa including the Wine Train and Starbucks, corner larger rooms have beautiful views but plenty of noise insulation. We arrived on a Saturday evening phenomenal duo musical entertainment. Very nice and well-informed staff. I've always thought of Hyatt andaz as the luxury Ritz-Carlton line of Hyatt Hotels, the one they built in Maui several years ago is absolutely gorgeous.  CONS: This one very much disappoints. Our room was full of marked up walls stained fabric in the sofa and even stain the lamp shades. The common area lobby bathrooms were filthy dirty and disgusting. Breakfast was good fresh and good service but of course not surprisingly for a hotel over price with things like $5 orange juice and $4 coffee. most high-end Starwood or Marriott properties have espresso included with their breakfast breakfast buffet or even General frequent stay accounts.<//text>

< Review>
This hotel was pretty much everything that I could ask for. Staff were always welcoming and kind, not to mention extremely professional. I must admit that sometimes people with families with small children get the side eye roll, but I didn't feel that at all in this location. Even though this hotel is nestled in the middle of a busy tourist area in Napa, they all seemed extremely down-to-earth and truly seemed to treat their guests like actual guests and not just customers. I enjoyed all the complementary goodies as well as the awesome gym access, especially for all the fun classes. I really wish I could have gone. The in-house restaurant for our breakfast was also just spectacular. the parking garage was convenient, accessible and included for hotel guests.I had a great time here and would recommend it to anyone in the area.< /Review>

Cozy design inside with low lighting and comfortable seating. The bar area is self-contained on one side of the room with a spacious lounge, attractive art, and unobtrusive music which makes for a easy place to chat over a drink. Recommended for a quick stop.<//Review>

<Review>The hotel is way expensive for what you get. The room is decent with plenty of space and a fireplace, as well as a spacious shower. Location is great with free self-parking. That's about it. The rest of the offerings are standard fare. No onsite fitness center, no hot tubs, no soaking tubs in the room, either. The showers head was leaking, so the rooms are definitely not maintained in detail. Aside from the spacious room, I don't see how the price per night is justified with this very basic offering.< /Review>< Pictures>

A high end hotel experience. It is well placed in downtown Napa, meaning you can walk around to a lot of great places to taste or eat.

The rooms are luscious and the hotel staff is very friendly and helpful.<//review>

My wife and I chose the Andaz for our Napa getaway and it did not disappoint! Once we arrived we were greeted by a friendly host who offered us a complimentary wine, gave us the lay of the land and got us our room keys so we could enjoy our stay. The room was extremely clean, modern, and exactly what we were looking for. Romantic tub in the bedroom, two big screen tv's, a huge bed, and a beautiful/spacious bathroom. It is located on a very safe downtown street with lots of restaurants to walk to no problem. When we come back to Napa we will be choosing Andaz without a doubt. P.s. the breakfast was also delicious as well as the nightly entertainment in the lobby bar area.<//text>

Valet parking is reasonably priced.  All good things, highly recommended, EXCEPT that the service at breakfast was laughably poor.  The food is great, but, the wait staff and cooks evidently are all brand new to the food service industry, so set your expectations accordingly and you'll be fine.  We're talking 25 minutes for a cappuccino, food orders arrive wrong, false promises across the board, wait times unreasonable overall.  But - aside from that, 5/5 for this property.</text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<rate>5</rate><text>The team at Andaz Napa is unbelievable. The service and the hotel exceed all expectations. The Concierge arranged great transportation for our group of 18 women. The food and beverage team (and really the entire staff) set up a dinner event for our group to celebrate our college reunion. We started at the fire pit on the terrace, had charcuterie and champagne then enjoyed dinner at a large table in the restaurant downstairs. They made the evening very special for all of us and made my life (the person planning it) so much easier. Beyond that, our group enjoyed gathering at the fire place before we left for various activities and meals and the rooms were absolutely gorgeous. There were always staff members around to assist with anything and the professionalism was very refreshing. We can't thank the hotel enough for making this weekend special for us! Thank you Thank you!</text>< pics>

Greeted with a smile and instead of a traditional check in experience, we were ordered wine and got checked in via an iPad. Celebrating our anniversary and we're gone a content upgraded to a suite. Also were given a nice bottle of champagne. Very friendly staff and they've got a great deal area on the second level.<//Review>< Pics>

I'd love to give this place a good review, but they failed before we started....

My husband and I were booked to stay September 8-10. Unfortunately, when the earthquake hit, this was one of the few properties that was closed because of damage. What is bothersome is that we received no notification that the hotel was closed. We found out by chance on Twitter. Had we not seen the list of hotels we would have been left without a reservation for our trip.

To make matters worse, when we called, they offered no assistance on helping us find an alternative and seemed to be only interested in getting us refunded and off the phone as quickly as possible.

I hear they are closed through the end of September. I hope they have contacted other guests. We were lucky enough to get a reservation at another location.

Don 't get me wrong, the earthquake is an unfortunate situation for all of Napa. But this hotel is owned and operated by Hyatt.  An email or call was expected.  They dropped the customer service ball on this one.</review>

Loved my stay at Andaz Napa. Open, attentive and friendly service from the start. The bell staff, receptionists and bar team were outstanding. Very welcoming place. Rooms are in a great condition and fit nicely into the Napa environment. Fantastic gym attached to the hotel and easy outdoor running. Would return anytime. Thank you.<//Review>

I drank at the second floor bar which has a nice set up. There are rocking chairs around a fire pit. There is a one page menu for cocktails but they were good.</review>

Nice hotel.  Rooms are reasonable size with comfortable beds and an elegant bathroom that includes walk in shower.  Free WiFi.  Restaurant downstairs has good food and fast pleasant service.  Lobby has a jug of lemon flavored ice water at all times which is a nice and welcome touch after a day of wine tasting.< /Review>

Live music Saturday nights. Makes it a nice place for locals. Roof top is a hidden gem. Not a huge fan of the alcohol selection, but still keep coming back..< /Review>

Pro: public restroom, moderate to tall hotel, valet parking available. In downtown Napa within walking distance to whole downtown bars and stores. Con: no obvious parking area, could park in temporary garage free few city blocks away and walk to lobby.<//review>

Check in was very pleasant. They hand you a glass of wine while you wait and have various salami, cheeses and crackers to snack on. The room was very nice, but there were a few issues. One being that the bathroom door handle came off in my wife's hand. The other issue was the cleanliness of the bathroom, the mirror looked like someone sneezed on it, the soap dish had hair in it and the toothbrush cup had mildew in it.< /text>

Even though I stayed at a competitor’s hotel in Napa as well, because the Hyatt was booked, I will say that the Hyatt was much nicer.  I will always choose Hyatt for all of my future bookings as I always do. I had a junior suite with a fireplace.< /text>< pictures>

<Text>WAW! Excellent Location, Excellent Service, very warm ambiance in the lobby.. the fireplace, the farmhouse / barn decor, everything is very well done. The room was extremely clean and rustic, all the food and drinks in the room were free except for alcoholic beverages which was a great gesture from the Hotel!! They had Bath robes, flip flops, and everything you might need in a hotel room was there! we tried the food at the bar: Pretzels and hummus plate. The Pretzels were exactly like the ones I had in Germany!! Done perfectly and you won't be able to stop eating! The hummus plate had mini delicious pickled peppers  and many other fresh farm vegetables, just wow! Breakfast was ok, not very special, the juice wasn't freshly squeezed which was disappointing but overall was ok. we expected a better breakfast.< /Text>< pics>

We stayed at the Andaz in March of 2013.  Everything from the check in to our check out was a wonderful experience.  We requested a high room, which I had read to do on other reviews, and they were very accommodating.  I had read that some guests didn't like the fact the gym wasn't located in the hotel.  We didn't mind having access to the downtown sports gym next door.  It was a great place to workout!  ...and it's NEXT door!  We loved the atmosphere in the lobby.  There was wine tastings going on, fresh juice in the mornings, a fire to read the paper by and people eating at the farm to table restaurant.  It was the perfect mix of the wine country and city life.  We loved it and thought the location was great... walking distance to Oxbow Market and right across the street from Oenotri, which is a fabulous restaurant!< /Review>

Stayed at the Andaz for all three nights of our visit. Everything was top-notch, in my opinion: the staff, the facility, location ... all excellent. I also enjoyed having access to the gym which was right next door. We would definitely stay there again.</Review>

<text>Here with a group, very pleased with the service and adaptability of the staff to accommodate us. Location: this is a great location for walking Napa downtown area. We had a very small room where I hardly had room to put down my suitcase and it was $400 a night.</text><username>Trip.com Member< /username><time>1499299200000< /time>< user>

<text>My wife and I spent Sunday and Monday nights at Andaz Napa and really enjoyed the experience. We like the location as is right in downtown Napa and has lots of bars/restaurants you can walk to. Our rooms were not quite ready so they had glasses of wine waiting for us to enjoy.< /text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x8085065d46d1913b:0x3efb561f7b7e36fe<//gmap_id></record>

There are the small things you expect like bathtubs and in-room movies available for purchase and the bigger things like sound-proof rooms. The breakfast was OK without having much imagination so lets say you will start the day fueling up then moving on to the wineries. Easy access to highway to wineries.<//Review>

I used a suite upgrade but the room was still small and overlooked building rooftops instead of the vineyards of Napa Valley.

While a decent hotel in accommodations, not really enough to draw me back if visiting wine country again in the future.<//review>< Gmap_id>

Great location for walking around downtown napa. It's very, very modern and adult. I guess in an effort to attract more customers to the bar, the lobby doors were open so the loud music ended up into street and everybody with rooms facing the street had no choice but to listen.</Text>

after reading about self parking on their website, I parked in the garage behind the hotel. the signs were confusing since it said no overnight parking and no signs of hotel parking spaces. Room was great the free drinks in fridge were awesome. however, service could have been better. the girl checking me in had me wait as they try to find me a room...i came with my coworker at the same time and they gave her keys while I had to wait with no explanation. then 20 mins later, I got my keys and my room was right next to my coworkers. then they didn't tell me about parking and I had to go to get a pass at midnite to go put it in my car. the guy first said it should be okay without a pass but the city does come ticket cars... well so I didn't want to risk it. my experience was very unhelpful as I felt like I had to be the one asking and getting things myself.</Text>

We were warmly greeted with a glass of wine at check in and that level of service resonated throughout the remainder of our 4 day stay. The rooms were small but adequate, and very clean even for someone as OCD as me. Will be staying there on our next visit in March 2017!</Text>

This was "a concept" that should have been rejected before being put into action.  Not worth going into the lonnnnngggg list of complaints about this hotel.  So overpriced for the lack of service and unprofessional behavior it's astounding.  I really wanted to like it but I left stunned and flabbergasted instead.  I let them know what I thought and I hope they listened.< /text>

We loved the hotel and the people and the location was perfect.  Our hotel room was comfortable but a little noisy as far as street traffic.  Our room was in the front of the hotel and you could hear things going on outside during the night so that woke us up a couple of times.  Also, we were surprised that there was no pool.< /text>

< Review>
When you pay over $300 for 1 weeknight at the Andaz you should expect to get a good nights rest. Unfortunately that wasn’t the case for us! The room was very nice lots of space and amenities but the bed was absolutely terrible and worn out. It was so worn out that it dipped in the middle and my husband and I literally would roll towards the middle, my back was hurting when I woke up.< /Review>

Rooms are spacious and comfortable, stocked with complimentary snacks and drinks. Staff is incredibly nice and accommodating. Great atmosphere all around the hotel from the room to the lobby. Chick and creative decor throughout. Fantastic location, right across the street from the amazing Oenotri. Our favorite Napa hotel next to our favorite Napa restaurant! Highly recommend.< /text>

A nice property but a little underwhelming compared to other Andaz properties I've stayed at. For the price I expected more. Check in took 4.5 hours despite requesting early check in and being Globalist in their rewards program. Also the bar downstairs gets super loud until 130am to the point that they have ear plugs in the rooms. We were on the 5th floor so didn't notice it but it seems impossible to ignore if you are on the 2nd. Didn't eat in the restaurant but it looked really good.<//review>

Contemporary.  Nice change of pace from your traditional hotel experience.  Love the hardwood floors in the rooms.< /Review>

After trying to get out of Miami because of Hurricane Irma many flights were cancelled and everyone was conciderate of the disaster and making  it a day late and nor being re-inverse for the night, I think is not cool. Very beautiful place and very helpful staff</text>

got the napa experience here at the andaz napa. served wine even before we checked in. concierge was a great help. rooms were great. in the middle of downtown, so you're able to walk to many places without needing a Lyft. short walk to starbucks and great restaurants. would come stay here again.< /Text>

<Review>This place is in the middle of a construction zone. These folks don't even give you a sheet for the bed.  The real issue is they don't honor the "sloitude" door hanger (do not disturb sign).  Be very careful.< /Review><user_name>John Clemente</user_name>< Time>

The hotel is extremely nice, but so are many hotels. What stood out is the hotel service. Shout out to Patrick the front office manager. Also thank Alicia and pemela, the two conierige, that made our stay memorable.</Review>

great location with free parking at back city parking structure from 2nd floor and up. complimentary welcome glass of wine.  host and room service is very nice and prompt. sometimes they dont answer host phone because busy with a check in customer downstairs. rooms arent very big, we stayed at the loft with upgraded two person hot tub in the room.</review>

How can Hyatt calls this cheap renovated Regency Motel, an Andaz ?!? Best views are on a street (far far from any vineyard) at a maximum of 5 levels Service is matching a basic motel. Decoration is, at best, an old Centric. Breakfast is overpriced and no buffet. Beeeurk. Climatisation sounds like an plan engine in front of your bed...even when off ! Matelas are great and the little patio is ok. Of course they have NO pool/gym/real suites. Extremely dissappointed : I shorten my trip to exit ASAP. Go to the Archer next block or in the vineyards for real experience<//review>

Lobby was too loud with drunk folk at the bar each evening.  Had to wait until 4:30 pm for check-in...this is far too late especially with the high room price.Would not stay at this expensive hotel again...overrated for what you get.</Text>

Tonight my husband stumbled upon the lobby/bar area of this hotel, and enjoyed an evening of drinks and music by Justin Diaz. It was lovely. I have to commend the staff who, while we were there, very successfully handled a group of inebriated older adults who towed the line of ruining it for everyone. The behavior displayed by these guests was apalling, dangerous (one of the guests whipped his shirt around and ended up breaking a glass when he threw the shirt across the room), and blatantly rude. It was uncomfortable to watch, and furthermore, it was infuriating to listen to these people berate the staff who politely remained firm on what kind of behavior would and would not be tolerated. Without creating a scene, the staff members successfully handled the situation without drawing an extreme amount of attention or causing the scene to become out of control. Thank you to the staff for allowing us to enjoy a nice evening, and very tactfully and professionally handling an unfortunate scene.

Sidenote, great bar, fun downtown vibe, and we highly recommend Justin Diaz.... make sure you see him when he plays this venue again!<//text>

<Text>Situated in the heart of downtown Napa, the Andaz provides travellers with a unique and luxurious experience. The rooms and amenities are top notch. The rooftop patio is a great place to sit back with friends, families, or your loved ones. Share a glass of wine! The complimentary initial glass was fantastic!

<review>The free Wi-Fi was slower than 4G LTE. The complimentary slippers ran out. Card in the room said you could borrow a humidifier, but they seemed to only have one for the entire hotel. Our shower head was rather janky and wouldn't stay in place. In the morning of our checkout date the cleaning folk tried to open the door at 9am when we were told checkout was at 2pm. Room was clean and nice, and the TV had Chromecast capabilities that was sometimes thwarted by the shoddy internet. Hotel bar seemed pretty popular and the lobby had awesome free hot cider one day.< /review>< pictures>

Cute hotel in the heart of Napa.  Close to all things Napa.  Get an evening drink fireside on the upstairs patio.  The rooms were large and rhe showers were big.< /Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>When staying at the ANDAZ NAPA we were completely impressed!  This boutique hotel was simply gorgeous!  Our very nicely sized room was off of a beautiful courtyard that offered open fire pits and a beautiful bar that allowed us to use this area to host a few of our friends and family that were staying nearby. The hotel even provided a complimentary evening happy hour with free wine and mini massages - all located in the charming living room styled lobby.  The hotel was clean and sophisticated.  We were right in the heart of downtown Napa making it very easy to eat, drink and shop locally.  The staff was extremely helpful, welcoming and very accommodating.  And an especially huge thank you to Mr. Joe Dupree for helping us to book our stay, it was everything he said it would be and more!  We can't wait to plan our return to ANDAZ NAPA.

<text>(Translated by Google) Located in downtown Napa, convenient anyway. There are many shops nearby, and Oxbo is just across the river. The rooms are modern and I was surprised to find the bathtub next to the bed. You can relax. The breakfast was also delicious. Surely a hangover? I remember there was a smoothie for people ...
However, it may be expensive for people who want to move around vigorously. Although I was excited to stay, I didn't want to be in the room. I want to relax next time.

ナパのダウンタウンにあり、とにかく便利。近くにたくさんお店があったり、オックスボーも川渡ってすぐ。お部屋もモダンで、バスタブがベッドの隣にあったりしてびっくり。のんびりまったりできます。朝ごはんも美味しかった。確か二日酔い？の人のためのスムージーがあった覚えが…
ただ、あちこち精力的に動き回りたい人にとったら割高かも？自分は奮発して泊まったものの、ほとんど部屋にいなくてもったいなかった。次はのんびりしたいな。<//text></record></dataset><record>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>(Translated by Google) The trendy brand of Hyatt, when entering the hotel lobby, the staff enthusiastically asked if they wanted a glass of red wine, and the sofa in the lobby was very comfortable, full of fashion and a little lazy. The decoration of the room is also very attentive. It is also a modern but cozy atmosphere. The type of room we live in has a bathtub for bathing. The surrounding area is easily accessible, and many restaurants and the Napa neighbourhood are within walking distance. It is worth visiting.

Hyatt旗下的新潮品牌，一進到酒店大廳服務人員便充滿熱情詢問是否要來杯紅酒，大廳的沙發也很舒適，充滿時尚中帶點慵懶的氣息。房間裝潢也十分用心，同樣是摩登卻令人感到溫馨舒適的氛圍，我們住的房型有浴缸可以泡澡。週邊交通方便，步行即可到許多餐廳以及Napa街區遊覽，值得造訪。< /Review>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) Great hotel with friendly staff.

Even the check-in is great: there is a glass of wine as a welcome. The staff is very friendly and helpful.

The rooms are very nice and modern. The cleanliness is very good, very comfortable beds. Good internet, TV even has a Chromecast integrated, so you can easily stream the content of your tablet or smartphone to the TV.

the location of the hotel is very good. Right in the heart of Napa. Many shops, restaurants, cafes and bars are within walking distance. So you don't have to worry about getting back to your hotel when you have a bottle of valley wine with dinner.

(Original)
Super Hotel mit freundlichem Personal.

Schon der Check-in ist toll: zur Begrüssung gibt's ein Glas Wein. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit.

Die Zimmer sind sehr schön und modern gestaltet. Die Sauberkeit ist sehr gut, sehr bequeme Betten. Gutes Internet, TV hat sogar einen Chromecast eingebunden, so kann man die Inhalte seines Tablets oder Smartphone bequem auf den Fernseher streamen.

Die Lage des Hotels ist sehr gut. Mitten im Herzen von Napa. Viele Shops, Restaurants, Kaffees und Bars liegen in Gehdistanz. Somit muss man sich auch keine Sorgen machen wenn man eine Flasche Wein aus dem Valley zum Abendessen trink, wie man wieder zurück ins Hotel kommt.<//Review>

Wir waren im Großen und Ganzen sehr zufrieden. Das Hotel ist schick aber trotzdem gemütlich. Schneller und problemlosen Check-In/Out. Softdrinks und Snacks auf dem Zimmer inklusive. Tolles Bad mit großzügiger Dusche. Das Hotel ist sehr zentral gelegen, viele Restaurants sowie der Wine Train sind fußläufig schnell zu erreichen.< /text>

Das Avia hat uns sehr gut gefallen. Wir waren eigentlich etwas zu früh dran beim Einchecken, was aber unkompliziert und entgegenkommend behandelt wurde. Concierge: Die Dame hat uns einen schönen Tag organisiert mit einem Kleinbus, der uns vor dem Hotel abholte und zu 4 Weindegustationen brachte und am Abend wieder vor dem Hotel absetzte. Das Zimmer war sehr gemütlich und vom Design her sehr ansprechend eingerichtet. Nettes Gadget ist der Fernseher, der sich zur Sitzecke und auch zum Bett hin drehen lässt. Beim Frühstück gab es wohl die mit Abstand leckersten Frenchtoasts auf unserer Reise. Am Abend konnten wir vom Hotel aus in Napa herumschlendern und benötigten das Auto mal nicht. Wichtig ist einzig, dass das Restaurant an 2 Abenden pro Woche geschlossen ist (SO/MO). Wir würden wieder dieses Hotel buchen.<//review>

Wir haben hier drei Nächte verbracht, um das Tal kennen zu lernen und Weintouren zu machen. Das Hotel wie auch die Zimmer sind super stylish, sehr modern gemacht und haben uns von der Optik und dem Wohlfühlfaktor sehr gut gefallen. Erheblich gestört hat allerdings, dass am ganzen Gebäude außen die Klimaanlagen angebracht sind, die einen sehr starken Lärm gemacht haben, der trotz Oropax zu hören war. Diese permanente Lärmbelästigung wäre auch ein Grund, warum ich hier nicht wieder buchen würde. Schade, denn ansonsten ist es wirklich ein sehr komfortables Hotel mit ausgesprochen netten und professionellem Personal. Etwas ärgerlich fand ich allerdings, das wir beim Check-In für unsere Deluxe-Zimmer-Buchung ein absolutes Mini-Zimmer mit nur einem kleinem Fenster erhalten sollten (das im übrigen auch noch in gefühlter Armlänge ggü. einem lärmenden Klimakasten lag) Nach meiner Reklamation wurden wir allerdings ohne Diskussion in eines der größten Zimmer umgelenkt. Schade, dass man in so einem Haus überhaupt versucht, dass Zimmer in dieser Kategorie unter die Leute zu bringen. Napa selber war recht nett, der deutlich schönere Ort ist nach unserer Meinung allerdings Yount ville und St.Helena. Richtig toll war der Tagesausflug , mit einem Bus Besichtigung von vier Weingüter (den Anbieter Platypotours kann ich nur emfpehlen)</text>
