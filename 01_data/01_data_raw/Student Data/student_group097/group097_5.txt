They were pretty busy as usual. They do their best to keep the shelves stocked and that's truly appreciated when we are paying to shop there.
The staff are normally friendly and stay out of your way while shopping.
I'll definitely continue going back.<//text>

Normally a decent store but lately if a customer complains you can hear the staff talk crap about the customers. Tonight I went before closing and you would have thought the store was closed with pallets in the middle of the isles and empty boxes every where. I finally gave up left my cart nd grabbed the 2 most important items. I talked to one of the managers he said it was not that bad and he was responsible for the mess and he did not see an issue with it.< /review>

Prices are good! Clothing is great for the price. Cuddle Duds for $12.98. Their Christmas items and decorations are wonderful. Produce comes in smaller portions than at Costco so they don't go to waste as quickly.<//Text>

Well, today was my first Sam's Club experience. I have to say that I may be partial to Costco. Better quality, selection and nicer people. It wasn't horrible just not as impressed as I wanted to be. Cashier was friendly, management and door staff, not as much.<//review>

Unorganized. Why did I find vitamin gummies all the way by the backwall by the drinks were? And beef jerkies by the produce section...doesn't make sense at all. What kind of stupid games are we playing here?<//Text>

<Name>kimberly perez<//Name><Time>1590545534791< /Time><rate>4</rate><review>Sam's club is awesome but they allow retailers to be in store and approach customers for sales and dont know about others but I was lied to just so this guy could make a sale and come to find out he left out information that if I would have been told, i would have turned down his sale. Sam's club should be responsible for having retail sales people in their store, because they are inside approaching Sam's club customers not outside but inside and I'm about to have baby and I have to cancel services and use my own money to send back equipment and I paid taxes and fee upfront and am I gonna get that back? Anyway I'm very upset Sam's club should think about having retail services in their store because that's not right i got lied to and promised things that was not true and left out information regarding services that is a BIG  deal to know what you are agreeing to. I'm very very upset and this was done on purpose to make a sale especially during covid and I'm already trying to make ends meet especially with new baby coming.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Wasent pleased at all cant even check out of the store without a caucasian  older lady breathing down me and my brothers neck at checkout. it's not the first time I had issues with her I wish I had got her name but best belive next time I go I will get it. All the controversy about being there for one another and I still cant shop for my family in peace she literally  came by 3 times to ask if everything was alright all me and my brother where doing were scanning stuff and paying my brother even pulled out a whole bankroll of 20 dollar Bill's and the payment was only $150 just to show her we were just fine.  we had way more then enough money combined this lady is irritating  and really unprofessional I seen ppl with lighter skin scanning half the speed we were and she never asked them if they needed help its sickening  it might just be time to close this member ship and go to costco I never have to deal with people like that there.</text>

I got some lights here and all different parts of the lights went out within a few days of having them. It said on the box I could connect 9 of them together and I only connected 7. I live in a two story home so I paid some people $150 to put the lights up. I can’t get to the very top where they put the lights up to replace them. So there’s nothing I can do to replace the awful, no good, piece of trash, Christmas ruining, junkie, tacky lights. Thanks a lot, Sam’s club.< /Text>

4:45 and you  have 1 checker . Four or five customers in line some with full push carts then a checker who was chatting a few minutes earlier with the customer behind me escorts his chatting friend and says to him i will check you out. I left my cart with a chicken and beer and spoke to a girl at a podium it was like speaking to a wall.No problem solving skills i pointed out the employee that hooked up his friend he should be Fired but that wont happen. Shop at your own risk at this store.</text>

Great prices! Self check out is awesome. Workers at the food court are very slow, inattentive, and seemed untrained. The speed of the workers in general is so/so depending on who you get. If you can go to the store with very little employee interaction it goes very smoothly.</Review>

Typical Sam's Club... decent selection of generally good quality merchandise- and nothing junky, very good prices.  Snack bar has great prices and i really like their pizza, hot dogs,  churros, frozen yogurt.  They also sell gasoline a below local prices.< /review>

But I purchased spoiled almond milk/ and Greek yogurt . Most likely everything in that fridge went bad. I’m extremely upset.

Looked like a nice place to work. Lady at desk said they have over 30 openings. Not for me though. I'm not fresh out of high school so they don't want me working here.</text>

Usually all for Sams. Went in today because of a price on their website and the item I store was $5 more. They would not price match their item and told to not even bother for the manager (due to wasted time) because they won’t do it. How do you not price match your own website?!</Text>

To say Costco and Sams club are the same would be inaccurate. They each have specialized offers and offer certain services the other does not. Sams club will change out your car battery, Costco will not. Costco sells hearing aids, sams club does not. Cotsco is geared more for consumer bulk purchases, Sams club is more geared to small businesss bull orders.< /text>

Very poor customer service provided by the Store Manager. My car was damaged in the parking lot by a store employee's vehicle. It's been over month with virtually no help from the manager! So much for taking care of it's members.</text>

Problem with gas pumps for the guy in front of me. They closed his pump. My pump started crawling and came to a halt. Tank was not full. Went in to the pharmacy only to find it's closed for lunch from 12:30 to 1:30 which you might think would be a busy time for a pharmacy with people coming in during your lunch hour.< /Review>

Food court is the worst, they never have the items you want to eat. The workers seem to be lost in the cooking area. To some of you this may not be a deal breaker, to me its bad customer service and will be cancelling my membership.<//text>

<Review>If they ever need new tires or repair them, they do not even think about it. Terrible service, they do not have the necessary personnel to solve the demand for jobs. It takes more than two hours if you are lucky for me almost four hours. We have 4 cars registered with them and there are always problems.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>This store is awesome. The greeters, customer service, cashiers and pharmaceuticals clerks ROCK!!!! The food clerks always do a great job as well. Only 1 problem I have is a very rude green vest wearing CSM, Classandra. Over the last 5+ years anytime I visit this store and need CSM assistance and she is on shift, She displays a rude demeanor and very unprofessional attitude. Other than that everything is great.</Review><userid>101691674311819668563</userid><Rating>4< /Rating>< Response>

Horrible customer service. My transaction was cancelled in the self checkout due to having some NyQuil when the register said ask an associate for help. When I asked she cancelled the transaction.< /text>

(Translated by Google) I thought that due to the pandemic I would have less people, but it turns out that no, there are a large number of people who do not use mouth covers. I saw that some people did not let them in. Good for the store, that's how they protect themselves and we consumers protect ourselves. Good attention from the ATMs, very fast in the process.

(Original)
Pense que por la pandemia tendria menos concurencia de personas, pero resulta que no, existe un gran numero de gente que no usa cubre bocas. Vi que algunas personas no las dejaron entrar. Bien por la tienda, asi se protegen ellos y nos protegemos nosotros los consumidores tambien. Buena atencion por parte de los cajeros, muy rapidos en el proceso.<//Text>

App ordering and curbside pickup were fast & easy! First time having Crumbl and the cookies were very good. The banana cream pie is 🙌🏻 Wasn’t a huge fan of the chilled sugar (too sweet) with an almond extract kinda flavor. Cookies were larger than I expected & are big enough to split to try more flavors. Will be back!< /Text>

My first experience was amazing. My friend and I went to dinner then went to Crumbl Cookies for dessert! Their cookies are one of the best I’ve had in a long time. Amazing staff and the line is worth the wait. Didn’t take us long to get our order.<//text>

<Review>Awful experience. I was very excited to try these cookies. I decided to do curbside and ended up waiting over 2.5 hours for my order. I finally decided to go inside because it had taken so long and they were about to close. When I went in to ask about my order the employee informed me that they had sold out of cookies. I never got my cookies I had already ordered and paid for. Very poor way to do business. I understand they just opened so it was busy, I just think its very unprofessional to sell out cookies before filling orders customers have placed and paid for.<//Review>< pics>

<review>Super busy. We order through curbside pick up and took about 1.5hrs to get the cookies after arriving at the store. We’ve been to other crumbl locations before and they don’t seem to take that long. The cookies were good though.< /review><name>C Nelson< /name>< UserId.>

I have visited the Brentwood location a few times and the cookies are extremely delicious.  They are a tad pricey $14.25 for four so it’s a nice treat to have every once in awhile or to give as a gift….but everyone will enjoy these cookies.

A new location has opened up in Concord and I’ve heard a new opening in San Ramon is just around the corner. Enjoy!< /review>

The line was long about 15-20 min wait on Friday afternoon. The staff was great. Cookies are huge. We’re order chocolate chip, banana cream pie, and chilled sugar. We enjoyed them all.<//text>

It's a $4 cookie.  5 different flavors available.  It's a very thick cookie, a little gooey, almost doughy in the center.  They have a kiosk system for purchases, no human contact for that part.< /review>

I see where they got their name from.... When you pick up one of their cookies, it crumbles into many pieces. It IS very tasty, but you can't pick up a whole cookie without it falling apart. You will be relegated to eating crumbs. *update*... OK, gonna up my rating to 4*s...I believe the reason my cookie (peanut butter) fell apart is because it was still warm. But it was very tasty, also the chocolate chip cookies were REALLY GOOD. Might go up to 5*s if they lower the price a little.<//text>

Long wait just for cookies, but we wanted to see what the hype was all about! The smell of sugar permeated through our masks when we finally got in the door. Quick ordering when you know what you want. I mean, if you're waiting 20/30 minutes in line, you would think everyone would already know what they want by the time they approach the counter, right? Wrong. That's what holds up the line! LOL. The cookies smelled great, the kitchen was super busy! Cleanliness was a bit lacking if you ask me, refrigerator handles stayed dirty, kitchen staff all over the place with flour, eggs, oil, the boxes that the customers receive their cookies in are riddled with icing...messy, but the constant demand must make it tough to keep up? We ordered the 12 pack party box because why not? Cookies were very inconsistent as far as size, decorations/icing and amount of chocolate chips. A little disappointing to get a big chocolate chip cookie and your first few bites have ZERO chips. Errrggg. If it didn't taste like yummy butter cookies on it's own, I would have called to complain. My 2 dirt cake cookies were very dissimilar too, it was very evident that someone was cutting corners with the icing...wish I noticed before I left the store. Will I go back? Possibly...just to try some of the new flavors (that's the attraction I guess...always in search for the new stuff?) It's just sad to see that the fast paced work in the store makes employees serve inferior products for the prices you pay and the time you spend in line. Make sure you check the quality of your cookies before you leave!</text>

<text>First time customer. Called in the day before to prepare for a pallet of watermelon. Spoke with Amy she said no problem just come in and get it. I waited there for over 1 1/2 hours to get the order while people from the front office streamed past me without a care. Finally after seeing the frustration on my face, one of the fork lift drivers asked me if I was helped. He was able to located the order and the fruit. Some of the worst customer service I have sen in a while. Two other customers where with me experiencing the same delays. I do not recommend.< /text>< UserId.>

Always has great flavors of frozen yogurt! The original tarte is my favorite! and also the mango flavor is incredibly creamy! Due to COVID-19 once going inside you get in line and tell the employee what size bowl you want regular or large and then they ask about how much and what kind of yogurt you want. Option is 1/4 , 2/4 , 3/4 (a little more than halfway or 4/4 all the way filled) then they hand it over to someone else who will assist in putting the toppings for you. The bowl will then be placed in a weighing scale to determine your price. Lastly you can always ask for a lid.< /text>

<username>Michael Marriott< /username><date>1612993003113<//date><rate>5</rate><text>One of my favorite froyo places in the area. This location has a good variety of flavors. There are a few classics they seem to keep, and the rest rotate so each time I come in there is something new to try. The toppings are solid here as well, and are well maintained (not the absolute mess you see in some places).<//text>< Pictures>

The absolute worst yoghurtland in all history. This place Tart machine is always-ALWAYS out. Broken and out of service. I have come seven times in in less than three to four months to find it always broken. If it is working they are out of something else like they won’t have the topping dispensers or they won’t have the super tasty seasonal flavors (I’ll go to other locations sometimes it’s a little drive but worth it cause this place is that bad and I’ll see the seasonal flavors and FOMO) There’s something wrong with this place. Someone just doesn’t care or isn’t on top of their ordering or maintenance. I’ve given them so many chances because of the darn location. I’m over it though. I’m going to Walnut Creek location (they are maybe one star better but at least they’re a little better).<//Text>

< review>
Service the last couple of visits has been pretty disappointing. Today we walked in to the two female employees standing around sampling the yogurt. Too bad they didn't try all the flavors since two of them poured out melted yogurt. A woman who was in line behind us approached and said that the last flavor she had added to her cup was completely liquid and showed the girl, who was now behind the counter, who responded that there wasn't anything she could do about it, and said it was weird because that usually only happens at night time. I told her that the apple caramel flavor at the bottom of my cup had done the same thing and I got more or less a shrug. Usually a good section of toppings and flavors, but customer service could use some attention.</review>

This has been a staple for me and my family during summer. However, this particular location seems to struggle with maintaining the cleanliness of the machines during a busy day. I've been here a couple of times in the last month and several of the machines were producing runny yogurt. And, both times were 2-3 hours before closing.<//review>

This place is amazing. It's usually pretty neat and tidy. They do a great job of cleaning up after the kids who (understandably) make a mess. The flavors are eerily accurate. They have a frequent buyer card, that you can load into your cell phone, that actually results in a lot of free ounces of frozen yogurt.<//review>

Usually the service is decent. Today, however; I was ignored at the front door. Keep in mind the hours are from 11am-10pm. It is 11:41am, and it seems they are not yet open. To add insult to injury, the person inside literally ignores me and walks to the back. Whoever is charge should know this is going on at the Pleasant Hill location, honestly unacceptable.<//Text>

When I was ready to order There was no cashier and I had to peek into the back to ask him if i could pay.

A couple flavors were not working, however the flavors that did work were good. They had many toppings, but people kept pushing around you to get some. The fro yo was good, but the crowd was unpleasant.</Review>< Name>

A great place to take the dogs for a run. Has a beautiful field for ball and field games. There's a nice space for children to play. Parking because of Covid has been limited since they closed the lot down...hopefully it will open again soon...now you can park on the street.</review>

Super fun spot on the west side. It has 2 separate playgrounds one toddler sized and one for bigger kids. It has that soft cushion turf instead of sand or tan bark which is really nice. There is a great bike riding path for beginners needing a smooth track. It surrounds a really nice grass area that slopes a little. There is a medium sized flat cement area too. Easily manageable for parents to keep an eye on them while riding around on bikes or skates. This is all located next to the baseball/soccer fields. Check out there super affordable sports programs. All the way at the end of the sports fields is the skate park.<//review>

Amazing! Hands down the best place to take your children. Not only do they learn new things such as sailing and kayaking but they learn how to establish relationships that will last them a life time.<//text>

< Review>
The prices are obviously much higher than Target or Ikea, but the service and the quality of the material is just unmatched.  I had a very specific need and Tony went out of his way, even looking online for me, to find the item.  And I’m happy to report he found what I was looking for!  And it was on sale too :)<//Review>

I like this store more that it recently remodeled in the past year or so. Fresh look, little bit more organized, pretty conveniently located from LA. By Fremont and Main Street next to Costco.<//review>

I just got my sister and her husband the most amazing little house warming gift here! The have very different décor tastes… she is more rustic and he leans more to the contemporary side which can make shopping challenging, but not here! I found this amazing drink dispenser with a wood/ marble stand that I think they will both love!</text>

<Review>Went to Crate & Barrel's new location in pssadena, specifically to shop for a coffee maker. Sad to say this place does not compare to their previous location - the store is basically empty with a few pieces of furniture, nothing more, no household items.  Whose idea to turn this store into a design center?  Sorry to say, but I don't think the store will survive.  Won't go back again - this was my favorite store in Pasadena  -< /Review>< username>

So disappointing that my favorite store has decided to streamline & basically become a Design styling “only” There is nothing to buy.  No Kitchen wares. No Platters, nothing like it was Only large furniture pieces. I can’t see this working. Basically stay home & buy online.<//review>

<Review>Don’t buy items from C&B. They will have you wait for your item so they can display your item in store before they send you the item. I had to wait 2 1/2 months for my dining table and found out it was the displayed item in one of their store.< /Review>< Pictures>

I was pleasantly surprised at the price/quality of their furniture.  I like to think of myself as an educated shopper.  I grew up in a family of wood workers, so I know what quality looks like.  I also appreciate the effort it takes to make quality, so I'm not shocked at a bookshelf that costs $700.  If you just want a piece of furniture to fill a spot in your house, and you're not going to use it for anything, or think you'll ever move it... maybe not shop here.  If you care about quality, something you might move from house to house, or even pass down to your kids or grandkids, this is your shop (assuming you like their styles).</text>

Crate and Barrel has quality merchandise and fine upscale designs. Unfortunately, I found the customer service at this particular store to be remarkably bad. I was overcharged shipping, and when I brought it to a customer service representative's attention, I was told that I was mistaken. When I engaged my salesperson in my problem, it was confirmed that I was correct and overcharged. Nonetheless, I could not get a customer service representative to return my multiple phone calls and emails. Even when I contacted the store's customer service lead, my multiple queries were ignored over a period of several weeks. I spent over $6K on two pieces of furniture, and I should have received much better service than I did. I am both dismayed and disappointed, and will not patronize this Crate and Barrel location again.<//text>

The furniture quality is really bad. It's unfortunate that most people nowadays don't know how to select nice pieces. It's overpriced cardboard, a step above ikea.  Nothing original at all.<//Text>

The ice cream is delicious. I happened to get the first scoop of freshly churned ice cream. The ladies working were not very friendly. They dropped 2 of the 4 orders we had on the floor. One the lid cracked and they simply replaced the lid. Once we reached home I noticed broken plastic in the one container. The mix is was barely mixed.
So the staff needs work. The product however was tasty aside from the plastic. Despite being in the low 40s outside the line was out the door.< /text>

I love this place. Who doesnt like custom ice cream? The young people serving are always nice. My only issue is consistency in serving size. I go in with my two kids and usualy one bowl is almost overflowing and the other is just at the rim. Sibling rivalry kicks in and momma goes crazy. Lol< /Review>

I was in line with people in front and in back of me and more walking thru the door. One of the ladies made great suggestions. The other asked if it was ok to help the next family. Courteous and friendly. Dont forget to tip these ladies most are 'starving students' paid minimum wage and love their job.<//text>< pictures>

I am a big fan of Cold Stone any day. This particular day was not as inviting as the others. The customer service was spread out between employees trying to get off and some not wanting to be there. One employee that was servicing me and my kids actually took a phone call while starting my selection and then walked off to continue the call. I didn't know what to say except,  " Are they coming back to finish my order?' Another employee took over to finish my crew up. They come back to give me my total of $47.69. Ok so I ha d them a $50.00 bill. She says that they cant accept Bill's over $20. I said "Well given the total and to the fact that it was the smallest bill I had in my wallet can you accept it do to the price amount." I needed a manager to approve it as the manager saw it as I did. All of my kids as well as myself already possessed our individual ice cream cups and I wasn't a out to go and find change.  Just saying, this was not there best moment.  I left a tip anyway.<//Text>

First time there and was told it was the best. As I walked in and looked for seating all the tables were dirty. I then ordered and cleared a table for myself and family. Sat and ate for about 20 minutes. Tables were still dirty and nasty with used napkins on them. There were 3-4 workers and I'm sure one could of went out and cleaned the tables. Also a worker had friends there and she was tasting the customers (friends) drink. I believe that was unprofessional.  If the front side is dirty, who knows how dirty behind the counter is. I'm just saying.<//text>

<text>The employees were helpful and fast. You can get icecream cakes and ice cream cupcakes that are to die for. As with all cold stones you can get any mixture of items they have. This  place can get busy so if you know u want icecream don't second guess it just go and get your lovely desserts</text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

The ice cream is made fresh daily . It is a unique experience.where they mix your ice cream with topping right in a frozen piece of marble . The flavor safe yummy , cake batter is my favorite.< /text>

<text>Horrible customer service, great ice cream not worth coming here though the girls at the front are extremely rude. My wife and I came here to get ice cream and we will not be coming back, it's worth driving to a different cold stone . Haven't had an experience that bad in a long time so I thought I would share,  if your in a good mood go to another cold stone thus place will ruin your mood with the attitudes of the girls serving you.</text>< pictures>

The only problem with my visit was my fault. I ordered the wrong thing because I didn't see the cheesecake special. It was on the wall behind me but not the ones in front of me.< /Review>

<text>Buy 1 GET 1 FREE GOING ON (08/04/19 I dont know when the offer ends its for 12 piece fried wings and/or 12 piece shrimp!!)This place screams NOODLES its in the name.. but I think they’re more known for their chicken! Cheap, Chrispy, Mouth watering Chicken! And the price is RIGHT! Its not just pulling you in its really $4.00 (6piece) for bomb simple food! spent 5.44 because I wanted rice.. WHAT A STEAL! OH and they’re FAST!! 5 mins after ordering!< /text>< Name>

Price of buy 1 dozen salt & pepper chicken wings plus get 1 free is a 👍 deal, plus their roasted duck taste 👍 great! Not too salty like other places, just right! Haven't tried other stuff yet😋</text>

<text>Good food, and you get a lot for what you pay! The dining area is really small, so it's probably best to order your food "to go". The cook (owner?) was very nice and there wasn't a long wait for our food. The parking lot is really small though.<//text><user_name>Brea< /user_name><GmapID>0x80d9518f35677675:0xb94e0bf43535d9bc< /GmapID><userid>103897418237270164568< /userid><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Rating>

Food is good, but things have really changed since a new guy is running this place.  Customer service is mediocre...always has been.< /Text>

<text>I have never left a review on anything ever.. but I could not leave this one...
This place served the worst Asian food I have ever tasted. Bland, was missing half my order, disgusting... All around horrible experience. And poor customer service, do not waste your money here! If I could give a 0, I absolutely would.</text><response>None< /response>< rate>

One of the waiters was very rude and my food had strands of hair in it.   Lastly the place was not very clean but the food was ok.< /Text>

Love this place.  The owner is a real nice guy, the food is great, and the prices are the best anywhere.  If you're in the area and want a quick, inexpensive meal that also tastes good, this is the place.<//review>

If you like golden mandarin you'll love this place. It's a lot cheaper there's no 1hr wait for food and the portions are huge. Seating is a little small but what do you expect, majority of people take out now days.</Text>

<text>The food was not the best. Hardly any meat in the egg rolls. I ordered lemon chicken and the chicken I was given had no lemon sauce. My soup only had four won tons for a family portion. The sweet and sour shrimp were mostly bread. Not too impressed.. I will not be going back....</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

We doordashed from here andvwhen food arrived we noticed a piece of glass in my fried rice. When we notified restaurant, manager became upset and refused to give our money back. We drove to restaurant and personally spoke to manager. While we stood infront of counter, we noticed aunts crawling around the prep area. We took video and pictures of this. We will report it to health department</text>

Excellent service, quality food, the kbbq combo has a bit of everything for a nice price for a party of 2-3. The wooden interior and design sets a nice atmosphere.< /text>

Unbelievably over-priced. Horrible pricing. Can you believe this grilled short ribs is the large portion for $40+? If you haven’t noticed, there is a bed of raw onions at the bottom that also count towards the $40+.<//Text>

Nothing like hot Mandu Guk on a cold chilly SF day!  Lovely decorated Korean Restaurant in Heart of Japantown, with great service and great food!   But beware of what is A-ROUND this neighborhood on POST Street...... TIME IS ECHO OF AN AX WITHIN W..OO..D.</Text>

<review>The service and the food were good but it’s a bit overpriced. We ordered their signature steak (golbi — might spell it wrong :p), pork belly, shrimp, and one soft tofu soup. For me the shrimp was the highlight. One side note is that their lettuce (for you to wrap the meat) was probably one of the best I have ever had at KBBQ in west coast.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>We ended up here for a late lunch (1-2pm) because every other restaurant in Japantown was full with a wait.  We were so surprised that it was empty, and wondered if it was a bad sign.  Reviews were mediocre, but we decided to give it a try and were NOT disappointed.  This was our first experience at a Korean BBQ, and the waitress, who knew plenty of English, was really patient with us and very helpful in choosing dishes.

I have read some reviews that said children are not welcome here.  We had our 4 year old and 7 year old boys with us, and the waitress was very kind to them, and helpful in choosing dishes that they might like based on their dietary preferences!  We all enjoyed the beef bulgogi and side dishes as well as the noodle soup.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to friends visiting Japantown!<//Text>< gmapID>

We had a BBQ combo and it was really good. I’m not a Korean so I can’t tell if it’s authentic, but this is probably the best Korean restaurant we’ve been to in the Bay Area.

We used to live in Auburn AL where there are a lot of decent Korean restaurants because of the KIA factory plant nearby, and we’ve been missing those. Glad we found a new one here!<//review>

<Review>My family and I used all of our brain power to make the most honest review. We took into perspective portion size, price, quality, decor, and service. Portion size was horrible, we have that a 0, they gave us our water in a shot glass and all night we were joking about  how small the portion sizes were. Price was super expensive for what they have us and that was a 1. Quality we gave it a 7, they did well with their food presentation and the meat was cut well. Decor was nice and it was clean so that was an 8. Service was almost non existent except for the guy who sat us down so we gave it a 1. That leads us to a grand total of 17. We divide 17 by the 5 categories and we come out with a score of 3 out of 10. We divide that by 2 because google is a 5 star rating place. So the final rating is 2.

We're not coming back.</Review>< user_id>

This place is alright. Their Galbee meat is good but not cheap. It's 40 dollars on a small plate. But the taste is great, I love it.

Mackerel is also very good.

You do get a lot of side dishes, rice and soup. You can get free refills on the side dishes so you probably won't go home hungry.

Service is usually pretty friendly and fast.</text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>The food taste is not good and quality is on the low side.  The service also is not good.  I went on a slow time with only 2 tables to serve and It took a long time just to get more water.  The price is high for the taste and quality.  For a full bbq restaurant the side dishes should be good but not here.  There is only few different types of side dishes and the taste was not good.  If you are looking for korean bbq then go to any other korean restaurants in SF.  I know the korean food taste and quality well and this place is definitely a not good place.  They also added 20% tip on my bill since we had 6 people.  I certainly did NOT want to give even the 15.  I happened to be in the area so decided to go to this restaurant.  What a mistake<//Text>< pictures>

Introduced Korean BBQ, to Karin, we have unsuccessfully tried to find a decent one for a long time. Looked for one in London and finally found this one in SF. And it top the list so far… best one I had, I guess we have to go to Korea to beat it!<//text>

The food is very nice and good. Very tasty. The service wasn't that good, in my opinion poor. The price is pretty high. I would recommend to other people.</review>

Worst dining experience of the year. Terrible service (had to ask for water 4 times). Overpriced. Bad side dishes. BBQ didn’t vent well and I had a face full of smoke half of dinner. Literally nothing was good about this place.< /text>

It's a perfectly adequate Korean BBQ place, but nothing particularly special. And sometimes the meat it a little tough.< /Review>

<text>Not wealthy as Ad says. I and my wife when to there, and I had $42 per person dinner, and then I get the food, one is short rib, so small piece which may half as the #16, and then Saba fish, you can have it any any Japanese restaurant around $10, and then vegetable and few other dishes which are regularly automatic have. We spending more than $100 for tow, and then left more than half everything,(Because no good tastes. Any way, This is my last time to when there.
Again, Too expensive and not such good as other Korea returnables does.<//text><user>104162340305763403236<//user>< Rate>

I'm with some other reviewers. This is not a place you would like to come back. And here is My honest review: super over priced food; worst Korean BBQ experience; the waiter is rude. Plus, they won't change your grill. Remember they only change for 3 times. You'll have to sit smoke and boiling oil😞</text>

sitting there. They take away ur side dishes for "refilling" and then just forget about you.
They ignore your hands all the time.

This is not what I expect with their service or food quality at all.

Very disappointed. Will NOT come back.< /Text><name>Yuting Duan<//name>< date>

I love Korean and was excited to visit Seoul Garden. I had bibimbap and many side dishes. The food tasted fresh and authentic and I particularly enjoyed the kimchi which was perfect. The service was very good and I enjoyed the ambience of the restaurant. I will certainly return in the future< /text>

<Text>My family wanted to go to Japan town mall to do some shopping and I wanted to eat Korean food so I found the Seoul Garden restaurant online and thought it was perfect since it was right there in the mall. The atmosphere was okay. There wasn't that many people there. The price of the food, I thought was pretty pricey but went ahead and order anyway since I wanted to try this place out. The waitress made us wait a really long time to place an order and not once did she came and ask how we were doing. Maybe she doesn't speak any English but it still would have been nice to see if we need anything else. My husband did notice she went over to other Korean customers more. The food we ordered was alright, I've had better. I guess there you don't wait for them to bring you your bill. I had to go to the counter to pay. I wanted to pay with my Discover card but they do not take that so I paid with cash. I told the gal to keep the change for her tips....it was about $5 in change. She told me that wasn't enough and pointed on the receipt that her tip should be about $7.50. I should have just said it's not the law I have to tip this much and the service wasn't that great but being the kid my momma taught me to be..I pulled my last twenty dollar bill and ask her to break it so I can give her the extra $3.00. I left unhappy with the service and the taste of the food as well as felt like I wasted time and money that could have been spent somewhere a lot better.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Holy Moly this place was *cheap* despite of seemingly expensive look of the set up. Service was cheap, attitude was cheap, quality was cheap and I am still scratching my head for the reason why I went to this eatery.

OK back to the full course (BBQ table). We came here with a high expectation of better food and service due to its higher price tags on the menu compared to EVERY other Korean BBQ places we've visited in the past and boy I was so wrong on this. The only time when we were attended was at the entrance by the restaurant owner/manager and the experience just went downhill from there. During the ordering, the waiter only said what you *must* and what you *cannot* do. For instance, in order to sit by the BBQ table, one has to order at least 2 overpriced meats and they would not change your charred smoking grate until you beg so and here's the catch, they would only allow to change 2 times and that's why if you let them do your BBQ, they would just *pour* everything on the grate to save their time and trouble. There are a lot of other hidden rules that you would probably not notice until it's too late. During the whole dinner time (about 45 mins), no waiter/waitress came to say anything except when we asked for a new grate, and they did not refill any of our water/tea, nor our sides. The only interesting interaction was when I stopped the waitress from pouring everything into the grate, she aggressively handed over the tongs and pushed plates under my right elbow. However they became super *attentive* when it's near the end of the course and ready for the check. They would literally check your seat every minute to see if you have placed the credit card yet or not and couldn't wait to see you go after everything's done. What a contrast.

In regard to the food, it's OK and that's the reason I gave it a 2 star instead of 1. However the food is severely overpriced by about 50% and you couldn't even find a an appetizer that's less than $10. Every BBQ entry  (about 10 oz meat + lettuce) is from $30 to $50 and the quality is just so so. I've been to other much cheaper places where both food quality and service were superior. I would not recommend anyone who has a second choice to go here. You could probably have a better ROI of your poor $70+ on lottery- at least you could daydream a few days right?

Oh here's another interesting fact. The menu posted at their entrance does not reflect the true prices on the actual menu because they've bumped the actual prices a few times. Another interesting finding is that their actual menus are not consistent either. Some menus have salad-#8 option while the others do not.

Anyway, San Francisco in its own is a beautiful and charming city in our experience. This place, however, is a such disgrace to it.< /text>< UserId.>

<Rate>1< /Rate><time>1578812249012<//time><text>(Translated by Google) There is no answer. The food tasted just as good, but it took thirty minutes for the food to come out despite I had booked it from 6:30 pm.

He also gave me a doenjang stew for 10 minutes and then gave me mackerel and rice for 5 minutes. Seafood pancake took thirty minutes.

All of this was just because of the immaturity of the restaurant, so I was late to take care of the locals who came later than us.

The locals will take care of it. Ignore the tourists and take care of the locals.

Tourists ... There are a lot of restaurants here ...

답이 없습니다. 음식 맛은 그냥 그렇고 아침부터 예약하고 오후 6:30 시간 맞춰서 갔음에도 불구하고 음식이 다 나오는데 삼십분이나 걸렸습니다.

그것도 된장찌개 하나 주고 십분 있다 고등어주고 또 오분 있다가 밥을 주더군요. 해물 파전은 삼십분 걸렸습니다.

이 모든게 그냥 식당의 미숙함 때문이면 화가 안날텐데 가만 보니까 우리보다 늦게 온 현지인들 부터 챙겨주느라 우리것이 늦더군요.

현지인들은 가보세요 잘 챙겨줄 듯. 관광객 무시하고 현지인 부터 챙겨주니까.

관광객들은... 여기 식당 많은데 굳이...?</text><Gmap_id>0x808580bed9afabe3:0x6984b39ba244b968<//Gmap_id><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< UserId.>

(Translated by Google) There are many kinds of Korean food. Delicious food is mediocre, but you can eat a variety of Korean food. I ate was delicious, especially if the last.

If you wrap it up, it looks like it's fresh.

I’ve nearly tried everything on the menu in the last 25 years and it all has a wow factor . It’s nice and cozy , service is great 😊 Dine in, or takeout. it’s always delicious 🤤!!!!!!!! You’ll leave full , happy , and with leftovers every single time . 10/10< /review><date>1615424806526<//date></record>

<review>Cash only in 2021? I ordered the Egg Foo Young and Shrimp chop suey. The Egg foo young didn't even taste like egg, it looked like they used flour to save money topped with packaged sauce. The chop suey was mainly beansprout with a little broccoli stems, yes stems!!! This is why I don't trust reviews on google.< /review>< gmap_id>

<text>All I can say Is WOW!! I drove pass this place the day before I ate here and my thoughts were man that looks run down and ghetto. I was at the bar in the hotel ramada the next day and the bartender suggests it I laughed thinking he was joining but he wasnt. Fast forward I'm in this little Chinese restaurant and the prices didn't reassure my first thoughts from the night before but boy was I wrong not only did me and my friend get their delicious dinner but we ordered food to go for lunch the next day. Point of the story dont judge a book by its cover I suggest anyone in the area to please try this amazing restaurant.<//text><user_name>Orange Panda< /user_name><UserId.>109848746763262652913< /UserId.><Date>1553834955521<//Date></record>

Bring cash, as they don't take any credit or debit cards. The lunch specials are larger than most restaurants' dinner specials, and you most likely take some home to enjoy later! If you haven't ever eaten there, do yourself a favor and go there. You will be glad you did< /Review>< userid>

My favorite Chinese restaurant. Prices are reasonably good and great customer service. The only bad thing is, they only accept cash.<//review>

The Chinese food here is top notch. Lunches, Dinners are primary here with an easy to choose from menu. Service is adequate however the speacials make up for it.
Relatively cheap under 25.00 dollars for 2.

This is some of the best Chinese food that I've ever had. It's pricey, but it's well worth it. If this place were cheaper I know I would eat there a lot more frequently, and gain a lot more weight! Lol. 😄
My husband and I order this a la carte  Chinese food from this place for special occasions by calling over the phone and by placing our usual order, and it's typically around $45. We  order 2 orders of the chicken fried rice, vegetable lo mein, beef with broccoli, Kung Pao shrimp, and they always include free steamed white rice in the order along with fortune cookies,of course. 😋 I highly recommend this place, it's not a Chinese buffet and the food on the menu is perhaps pricier than a Chinese buffet, but the taste is well worth it.< /Text>

I got the complete wrong order and they just argued about how I was wrong and the order was right. So I tried what they gave me and it was horrible the shrimps were not clean and the chicken had no flavor. I would never eat here again.<//Review>

I tried this place because i saw numerous reviews about their tasty fried rice. My husband and i had the Cantonese fried rice, the Mongolian beef and the Cantonese chicken and they were all good except i wish they used chicken breast instead of dark chicken meat. The Mongolian beef had  a good taste, but the consistency of the beef is weird, had never tried a very soft rubbery meat. Looking forward to trying different plates next time. Prices are great compared to other restaurants  with similar food!<//review>

I've been coming here since i was a little girl.  Everyone one i take loves it too. The only part that sucks is that its cash only. The food is delicious and they are extremely nice ppl! Great customer service, try it for urself. Oh and the prices is very reasonable!<//Review>

Worst Chinese food I've ever had. The rice was fluffy and slimey, and the overall texture and color was off-putting, not to mention the taste. The hot and sour soup was the one with the most potential, except it was white and not with a hint of hot or sour.
The service, though, was really good. The staff is really nice and helpful.<//Text>

<Review>I've going there, on birthdays, since as long as I remember. Now, with everything that I've done, everything that I've seen, I couldn't wait to get back there...man, the food is still good, the atmosphere is still familiar and I still eat there like there's no tomorrow...thank you so much.  I intend to pig out there for years to come.<//Review>< Pics>

I made the mistake of not checking the door 🚪 for the Visa 💳 Mastercard acceptance ...  Cash only! Portions are large and I find that sharing works best when your with the ladies.< /Text>

Coming to America I've had the chinese here and its as if the food is Americanized BUT not this place. I get the chicken in oyster sauce everytime. Its fried (but a Chinese style fried) which is what I'm used to in Trinidad. This is probably the only authentic spot in san diego. And I cant stress out authentic enough. Love it, 5 stars hands down< /Review><Rating>5<//Rating><Resp>None< /Resp><username>Kester Williams</username><pics>None<//pics></record>

<review>Ive been going there since i was a kid. All other chinese food places do not compare to this place, they are AMAZING! Super delicious food and they have not changed one bit, the food tastes the same as it did years ago, that goes a long way with todays restaurants always trying to cut corners. Thank you Annie and fam for keeping it real!<//review><Date>1463974467682</Date>< gmap_id>

First visit. Came here because of the reviews. The food was so so. No green tea, only black tea. But I would give the staff and service a 4.5.<//Review>

Lindsay is an amazing and extremely helpful realtor.  She’s always there when we call no matter what time of the day.  My experience buying and selling my property was seamless and fun.  Thanks to Lindsay, I was able to sell my home for asking price and get into a great new home in Costa Mesa.  I would highly recommend her!<//text>

Yolanda & Luis are the best Real Estate Agents in the business highly recommend them. They are very professional and well organized, They have a game plan from start to finish and are always ahead of the game. They accommodate to your schedule and organize the showings in a structured way so no time is wasted that way you can view more listings in a day. Being a first time buyer you don't know what to expect,  but they make it easy walking you every step of the way and explaining what is next. If you're looking to buy your first home or even buying another property give them the opportunity to help you. You will not regret it. Thank You Yolanda & Luis you guys are the best.< /text>

Elizabeth Garcia was excellent in every way.  She was extremely patient in answering any questions, following up to any concerns and keeping us informed of the process along the way.  I never felt that she was just trying to make a sale.  I would never hesitate to contact her again for assistance or recommend her to friends.  In addition to her wonderful professionalism, she was an absolute sweetheart.  Thank you Elizabeth!<//Review>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>I got connected with Judy from REMAX New Dimension through Zillow when I started looking to purchase a condo. From the first point of contact, Judy was very responsive, professional, and patient.

Buying a home is a daunting process, and especially your first home which was my case. Judy was excellent at explaining the home buying process in the beginning and maintaining me informed and keeping me in track to get through every single step once we made offers and started escrow.

She took the time to understand what I was looking for, and then proceeded to find and show me listings that fit my needs. She was always available to answer my many questions, and even when she couldn't answer the phone I could expect a call back within minutes.

I highly recommend working with Judy if you're looking to purchase a home. She is very friendly, professional, knowledgeable, and made the process much easier.<//Review>< pictures>

Elizabeth was extremely helpful, open, transparent, and reliable through the whole process of the Short Sale, She really cared about us, understood our needs from the very first day. Even though it wasn't her Job. She helped us look for a rental. She helped until we were moved in and settled.  There's only one word that comes to mind. " Angel ".
She truly was and is an Angel sent from Heaven.
Elizabeth always has and will be considered part of the family.
REMAX Management and as a company, deserves praise for the wonderful agent they have working for them.
When I'm ready to purchase another home.. I already know who I will call.
Thank You Elizabeth.
Thank You REMAX.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Priscilla Martus is everything you'd want in a realtor.  She is smart, savvy, knowledgeable, diligent, straightforward,  and communicative.  Priscilla transformed my expectations of home buying and I could never have done it without her. She made me feel as if I was her highest priority - every phone call was answered and every text/email was answered efficiently.   Priscilla is constantly working behind the scenes making sure I am taken care of and was so patient with me in my search. I will never use anyone else in the future as Priscilla is a major asset to me and my family.<//text>

We are so beyond lucky to have had Luis and Yolanda assist us in buying our first home for our family.

With such an unpredictable market during our home buying process, I could not imagine having anyone else represent us.

The knowledge they both have of the market, their expertise on competitive pricing and writing competitive offers, they truly assisted us every step of the way. We looked at over 100 homes over a 6 month periods, often driving all over the county, they organized all of our showings to accommodate our hectic schedule. Each home they ensured that they fit our criteria and only wanted what was best for our family. They are so great at communication which was extremely important during this process. They also made sure to explain every detail to ensure we had a clear understanding to what was going to happen moving forward. We can’t recommend them enough.<//Review>

I felt no pressure along the way and Elizabeth was incredibly patient as we got to know our own tastes and needs.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1624505462467, 'text': 'Hi, Julissa.

Elizabeth García created a great marketing plan that was focused on our needs and expectations. The house was well staged and photographed beautifully. The listing was timely and we received multiple offers within days of the house going to market. All offers but two were well above the list price. The house sold for 9.5% over list. Very happy with result.<//Text>

Priscilla is an amazing and extremely helpful realtor.  She’s always there when we call no matter what time of the day.  My experience buying and selling my property was seamless and fun.  Thanks to Priscilla, I was able to sell my home for above asking price and get into a great new home in Costa Mesa.  I would highly recommend her!<//Review>

We recently had the privilege of working with Socorr a second time. After our first home purchase we knew we would always go back to her. Socorro definitely knows the real estate business. She was able to answer all of our questions, get any information that we needed and is fun and personable to work with. Being out of state she made the process much easier than I had thought possible. Thank you for always being there for us, Socorro!</text>

<text>Socorro has been awesome in finding homes matching our requirements and she is also quick in arranging showings upon request. She never pressures us to buy anything that we don’t like .

He would call me almost everyday to keep me updated of what was happening with the process. I would highly recommend him to any one who is thinking about  selling a house. He is genuine and would always ask if we had full understanding of what was going on. Thank you.</Text>

I’ve talked to Socorro multiple times about real estate and the real estate market. She is very knowledgeable, professional and passionate about her career. Anyone who works with her is lucky to have her on their side. It’s a competitive market and Socorro knows how to navigate the complexities to her clients advantage.< /Review>

We have known Elizabeth Garcia since 2012. We have worked with her on 3 separate transactions with her since then. Her passion, knowledge, experience and most importantly her ethics, are bar-none, the best we have ever come across. We will happily work with her on any future transaction.</Text>

Great insight on how business is done. Eliseo Magdaleno was very helpful every step of the way. He is a very hardworking individual and is always going the extra mile to make sure we do not feel rushed or pressured to make such a huge decision. I have never worked with a more professional company, they made the entire process easy. I will definitely recommend REMAX  and Eliseo to my close friends and family, they are a company you can trust.<//text>

From the first meeting with Elizabeth we knew we had made the right decision to trust her to list our home. Elizabeth is friendly, upbeat, professional and was in constant communication with us throughout the entire process. Our house sold within a few days and we could not be happier with the process and results. Thank you Elizabeth!< /Text>

<text>Marisa Rodríguez is the best at what she does.
She’s very patient and goes above and beyond for her clients. It has been a pleasure  working with her and having her as my agent. She helped me find the house of my dreams not just mine but the house my family loves.
I’m very grateful and very happy I found her.
She’s one of the best realtors out there that really cares for her clients and their families.
Thank you Marisa for your dedication for your time and for encouraging to go after my dreams of buying home.< /text>< rating>

<text>If you’re looking to buy or sell a home look no further, Remax New Dimension will make sure you’re well taken care of. Working with Hugo and his team was everything we could have asked for and more during our first time purchasing a home. Not once did we feel pressured and I truly feel they had our best interest in hand from the moment we contacted them up until we got the keys. Thank you to the whole team for making this experience amazing.<//text>< Resp>

Elizabeth Garcia was referred to me, I can't be any happier with the end results. It was a long and trying experience and Elizabeth was there at every step communicating and working hard for me to find, bid, and close on a house of my dreams. First time buyer and she took the time to educate me on the process. She is #1 on my book.</review>

I wanted to take a minute to commend Aurelio for being such a genuine person who takes his time to help you out, listens to you and sincerely wants to extend his best foot forward with you. I am not quite prepared yet to jump into the RE market at this moment, however, I got to know Aurelio really well and he's such a great person, professionally, as well as, off the clock so when the time is right for me to purchase, he will be the one I will give my business to.

Thanks, Aurelio for being such a great dude!< /Review>

<Review>I'm a first time home buyer and did not know what I was doing. I was really lucky to have found Jessica Gugliotta. She is very knowledgeable and was able to walk me through all the processes. Jessica is also very responsive, and is always available 7 days a week to help with anything. We submitted multiple offers  to different houses, and all of them were accepted. Because Jessica have a close relationship with lenders, she is able to work with lenders to offer very fast escrow and beat out competitors. I would highly recommend her as a an agent</Review><response>{'time': 1611745482258, 'text': 'Hi, Wei. We are thrilled to learn that you had a positive experience with us!'}</response>< name>

<Text>Jason Luu was everything and more than we could’ve ever asked for in a realtor. He is dedicated to perfecting his craft and is constantly keeping up with the market. Last week we called in for a tour for a property and being first-time home buyers, we had so many questions. One by one Jason answered them all and made us feel at ease. He approached us with such generosity and definitely made us feel that our family needs were his main priorities. Before meeting Jason, we felt as though we were always in the dark, we didn’t know what steps to take or not to take. Jason was there to hold our hands and guide our family to where they needed to be. I highly recommend reaching out to Jason if possible. He will always be our realtor for life.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<text>I was looking for a particular property with certain charm and reasonable price. It was hard to find but Sharon with her experience, knowledge and contacts in the industry was able to find a perfect place. I am enjoying every minute of my new home.  She is very personable and someone you would like to be friends with.< /text>< Name>

Aurelio has been very patient and knowledgeable throughout the stressful processes of finding the right home. He has definitely put in a lot of work to make our dream of owning a home come true. Overall the company is reputable and holds it’s self to a higher standard. I recommend everyone who’s looking to purchase a first and even a second home to give them a chance to right fit you with your dream home.<//Review>

My family and I needed assistance with finding a new place in an emergency and Sharon was on it the second I called her. Thank you guys for being so stellar at taking care of your clients!<//review>< Pictures>

My experience with Miguel as a realtor was very positive. Coming in as a first time buyer, I was very nervous. He was extremely helpful and knowledgeable which calmed my anxiety down on a few occasions. I didn’t feel like he was being pushy and trying to get us into the first house we saw. We explained what was needed and he even threw ideas to use the rooms to better maximize them. I recommend Miguel and his whole office to all my friends who are looking to buy or sell.<//Text>

Judy Campuzano is more than just competent, she is excellent.  Not only does she know the process, she listened to our needs and found us multiple listings.  She showed us homes that perfectly suited our budget, a few fixer uppers, and a few at the very top of our price point.  This was important as it gave us a solid understanding of what we could and what we shouldn't try to buy.  Once we made an offer, she kept the process moving forward and was in constant contact with us every step of the way.  If/when I buy another home I would certainly want to work with her again.</text></record></dataset><record>

We found Aurelio to be a highly attentive agent, almost as if we were his only customers, although we know that was not the case. He returned all phone calls and emails the same day. We never felt neglected or unimportant. He is also highly personable with an engaging personality. Aurelio was honest about some minor changes that we needed to make in our house to attract buyers quickly, and his advice worked like a charm.<//text>

I live in NorCal (BayArea) and actually contacted Valeria and her husband, Jesus, because a family member in SoCal recommended them. They helped my husband and I get our dream home here in NorCal even though they reside in SoCal. They partnered with someone here and the  process was smooth. They are very detailed oriented and knowledgeable in the field. Whatever question I had, I got an immediate response back from Valeria. Valeria and her team make you feel like family, not just a business deal. I highly recommend Valeria and her team.</Review>

Being a first time homeowner is scary and having little to no knowledge of the whole process made it even scarier, but Jason is very professional, helpful, reliable, and knowledgeable. He kept me informed and was patient with educating me through the whole process. I couldn’t have asked for a better experience, 10/10 would recommend!< /Review>

Sharon is the best!  She is thorough,  professional and great to work with. She is very knowledgeable of the local market. She was very helpful by explaining everything in a way that was easy to understand from making the offer to working with the mortgage banker.

Lamar Thomas and the ReMax New Dimension team have been outstanding in their guiding us through the buying and selling processes, patiently answering our questions and giving us advice specific to our situation and needs.  Lamar definitely gained our confidence and trust in his work on our behalf.  From a financial perspective, we spent less and made more than we expected to and ended up with what we think is the perfect property.<//Text>

< Review>
I am a realtor that specializes in Ventura County property.  I had a client that was looking in either the Anaheim or Fontana areas which is out of my area of expertise.  I searched fellow RE/MAX organizations looking for the right match for my clients when I came across Claudia Negrete of RE/MAX New Dimension.  I read her bio and then interviewed her over the phone.  She seemed like the perfect match.  Experienced, knowledgeable and motivated to customer service.  I made the introduction and stepped out of the way.

Claudia jumped on the situation immediately knowing that inventory is tight and wanted to expose our clients to available properties right away.  She met with them and got right to work eventually helping them to find the perfect home for them.

What I like about Claudia is her enthusiasm to her profession, her communication skills by keeping informed of their progress and her persistence in this very competitive market.  The inventory is extremely tight right now but she wouldn't give up until she was able to get a winning fair offer accepted on behalf of my referral.  Then she and her staff managed the file to a successful closing.

In my nearly 40 years of real estate business I would say that Claudia is one of the most trustworthy agents with whom I've worked in a referral situation.  If I have more referrals for the Orange or San Bernardino Counties I will go to Claudia first and highly recommend her to others.<//Review>

Meet Sharon Vasquez almost 2 years ago, in the end I did not purchase a house, because thanks to the covid i lost my job, but she always contacted me asking how I was, even if she knows that now I am renting a new place and I will not buy anything for maybe 5 years?
She is really nice and honest.

Together we when to see apartments and she was the one telling me.. no I don’t like this one for you. Let’s go see another one 😊

I will always ask for her help and I will tell all my friend to reach out to her if interested to buy a home< /Text>< Pictures>

My real estate agent, Jerry Gallegos, was the one who made it possible for me to own a home along with his team at REMAX. I would highly recommend buying a house with REMAX and would recommend Jerry Gallegos as your next real estate agent for being professional, knowledgeable, and persistent.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Prior to working with Claudia, we’ve spent almost a year with another agency only to walk away with many issues & miscommunications. They were great people, just didn’t work out. Now that we’re with Claudia, the process of searching, touring communications, professionalism, and most importantly my vision of the investment that I’m searching for seems so effortless. Claudia always goes above & beyond to get things done. She texted me early in the morning when listings are available, answer questions or request anytime of the day,  and even made an appointment before the home is on the market,WOW!  I’m also one of those very picky people, everything has to be my way. Working with Claudia, how ever long it takes to find the right investment, I truly feels relax & comfortable knowing that I’m working with one of the best agent. Did I mentioned that she is SUPER knowledgeable, ethical, funny, & overall a wonderful agent & a beautiful person. If anyone needs an excellent agent with great professionalism & qualifications, you need to contact Claudia!! You will definitely have a great experience!!!< /Text>

We cannot recommend Luis Arellano and Yolanda De La Isla enough! If you are looking for a team who will fight for your family, negotiate the best deal while keeping your best interests then you have found the right one! We have been lucky enough to have had them represent us on a sale, but on the purchase of our first family home as well. we had ran into a few hiccups with our loan company, they pushed through, fighting for us to ensure we did not experience delays. They are so great at communicating and find a way that best fits each person. We work lots of hours and have a hard time with phone calls; they always made sure to reach out via text (our preferred communication) and Made sure we were always in the loop. They have a great understanding of the real estate market and have really adapted in the current market we are seeing. Without them our home wouldn’t have been a possibility.

They are more than real estate agents, they have become family to us. Definitely check them out!<//review>

I can’t say enough about my experience with Remax. Their services starting from the first interview, to the photography - to showings, was all too notch. Each time we had a question, the response was thorough and quick. Our house was sold quickly and above asking price. Would use their services again.</Review>

She puts all her efforts into making sure you receive the best deal possible and went above and beyond throughout the entire process. The one thing that stood out to me the most was how unique and honest the team at REMAX is. Will definitely be working with Nagla again soon!< /Text>< Pictures>

My husband and I had a wonderful experience purchasing our invest home in Valencia from Yolanda De La Isla & Luis Arellano.  They are a dynamic duo!  They were very communicative, always followed through with each step of the process and were proactive in getting us our property during this competitive house buying market.  This is the 2nd home that this dynamic duo has helped us purchase and we highly recommend them to anyone looking for honest, hard working and trustworthy agents.<//Review>

The best realtor ever. At first, My wife and I were a little nervous because it was our first time buying a home and also having a realtor help us.  So it was hard for us to trust someone we didn’t know.  Our realtor Ms. Negrete was very kind and professional.  It wasn’t difficult to trust her.  She made our first time buying experience very easy and non stressful.  Bless her heart for the fact that she answered all of our questions and concerns.  She even explained at every house we visited all the details of the home.  I highly recommend Ms. Negrete as a realtor for anyone purchasing a home.  She is bilingual and a very pleasant person.  As I said before, she will answer all your questions and makes you feel secure in making those important decisions when signing.  I can keep complementing her but last thing I can say is that you won’t find a realtor like her.< /Text>

Estrella picked up my sale after a refi went sideways. She was very helpful and responsive whenever I had questions and she found a buyer after only two weeks of listing over asking price! She also set up photographers with very professional photos and coordinated all of the title and escrow side. Very user friendly for a hands off person like myself.<//Text>

I had the pleasure of working Mr. Rosas recently. He was able to answer my questions in full and was completely honest with me through the process. I appreciated his transparency and his commitment to help me with the home I was interested in. One quality I noticed that was different from others I have spoken with was his caring quality. Mr. Rosas truly cared if I was happy with his service and cared about the input I provided.<//review>

<Review>I would like to commemorate the work ethic and exceptional character of Aurelio Osorio. He has proven time and time again that he offers world-class service that can’t be taught, but only learned through observation and mastering the art of genuine human interaction(s). He has assisted my friends and family with all of their real estate needs. Let’s be honest and clear...we all know an “agent”, but his passion drives him to be more than just an agent. I can assure you that in the process Aurelio will not only become your real estate go-to, but also your friend. He welcomes any inquiries and does an amazing job of listening to client’s needs. He has second-to-none critical thinking skills and adaptability in his approach to tackling and solving obstacles that often arise in real estate transactions. He goes above and beyond and brings you solutions instead of rebuttals. I would highly recommend Aurelio Osorio from REMAX New Dimension to anyone who is in market for anything real estate related.

I was in a tight spot and was in need of a new home to live in and Sharon reassured me that she will help me and do anything and everything in her power to help me the best she could. The moving process/paperwork/etc. was such a breeze with Sharon beside me. Thank you Sharon for your compassion and your time. My mother and I are so very blessed to have been under your care during this troubling and stressful time. Thank you for your hard work and dedication in finding a beautiful new home for us. You are greatly appreciated Sharon!< /Text>

Re/max New Dimension offers a great working environment. Edgar Adame, Miriam Adame and the staff are wonder people to work with.

We randomly found Jessica Gugliotta on realtor.com and we went from initial phone call to keys to new house in less than 35 days. I could not have asked for a better experience. We were first time home buyers and were not at all familiar with the experience but she made the process very easy to understand. She was always available to answer questions day/night/weekends and we had a ton of questions for her. We probably asked her the same questions over and over again and she patiently reassured us. There wasn't a single instance where we felt pressured or at risk. If I had known buying a house would be this stress free, I'd probably done it years ago. I can't recommend Jessica enough!< /review>

As a first time buyer, home shopping can be intimidating. I was unsure of where to start and I’m glad I ended reaching out to Aurelio. Aurelio found ways to communicate to me where things made sense. I could not have expected this quality of service. Within minutes of texting him, he responds with an answer. He’s toured me at a few homes and can’t thank him enough.</text>

<Text>I would recommend their agent Jessica Gugliotta because she is unlike your typical agent out to chase the commission. Patient and knowledgeable, she recommended properties and answers your questions promptly. Patience is a virtue as they say and so true in Jessica’s case. Buying a home is an emotional rollercoaster and Jessica made sure that the ride was a safe experience.</Text>< pics>

<review>I first contacted Jessica to inquire about a property in Huntington Beach for which she was the listing agent. What I liked about Jessica was that rather than trying to just sell me a property, she listened attentively to what I needed and made recommendations. I asked her if she could be my agent, as I was not really working with anyone. She accepted, and immediately added me to her daily reports, once she understood what my needs were in terms of type of house, area, price range, etc. Within three weeks, we had already placed an offer for a condo in Huntington Beach. She worked very closely with me, answering all my questions and requests.

This condo is a dream come true! I could not have asked for a better real estate agent and a better outcome! Thank you, Jessica!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

They quickly built trust with me with their genuine responses and transparency. They seek your best interest! They patiently walked me step by step as I resolved all my concerns about this process. They gave me undivided attention and found me the right place, a fit neighborhood, and a comfortable deal. I am definitely running back to them in few years when it is time to upgrade :)<//text>

<review>My family and me  are so grateful with Hugo Pompa, there aren't enough words to describe his excellent service and how lucky we are to have used his services. We needed to sell our family  heritage being far away, without knowledge of all the process and with million doubts. He was beyond professional, he became a friend of our family advocating all the time for us, solving problems, answering questions no matter the time or day of the week and answering questions over and over. He cared about our family and help us with problems he shouldn't need to deal with as part of his job, that is why we will always be so thankful with him.  If you need more that an agent to sell or buy your home you couldn't make better choice that Hugo Pompa.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< userid>

Jeffery is an amazing person and a great real estate agent. He is very reliable, punctual, keeps you up to date, and is there for you any time of the day to answer your questions, even outside business hours. Jeff is very well informed, not only about house sales, but also about different types of  loans. It was very helpful to have someone who works with such a great team to create the complete package for those looking to buy a house. We had a wonderful experience. We got info applying for mortgage loans with three other places, and there was no comparison in the manner that we were treated. Jeff ultimately came out on top with the best reference for a mortgage loan. He was also very motivating throughout our home-buying ordeal, and extremely easy to work with. We highly recommend his service!<//text>

<review>I found Claudia Negrete on Zillow and that's when our fun journey began. Couldn't have asked for a better realtor. She went above and beyond our expectations. She was the only realtor to contact me back when my family and I were looking for an agent to orient and give us direction in regards to a mobile home purchase. She responded promptly but not only that, she also connected us with our bank that specialized in such special loans and they are also awesome people at the Mortgage Loan Company she recommended us to. I love how she doesn't take no for an answer because that persistence personality that she has pays off. For some reason our community mobile home management was making it hard for us to get approved, but she put in the hard work and made it happen for us. We were approved with the community mobile park and purchased our home thanks to Claudia Negrete. My family and I couldn't thank her enough. She will definitely be our future listing and purchase agent again. Thank you Claudia.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><userid>104075431542684377018< /userid><Time>1605367876136<//Time><gmap_id>0x80dcd97b3f1941db:0xb030e73e47efa31<//gmap_id><Rating>5</Rating><resp>{'time': 1605372086261, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your kind words, Lizet.

Let me be the first to tell you, buying your first home is terrifying. My wife and I thought we had it down. It can't be that hard right? WRONG. After spinning our wheels for about a month, a few offers rejected, we had given up all hope. We decided we needed to find an agent to assist us. That's where Chris came in. We took some time and researched about a dozen agents online, and were beyond impressed with Chris's reviews from his past clients. Upon reading through them, it was obvious that he genuinely cares about his clients happiness. Now reviews are only a part of it in my opinion, results speak even louder, and with Chris, the results speak for themselves. Chris and his team close 100+ deals a year, the average agent we've come to find out closes 4...per year. Let me spell it out, Chris and his team close 25x more homes per year than the average agent. We found the perfect home, were 1 of 7 offers, beat them all, and closed in 17 days. After asking around, I was told by a few friends/other agents that is impossible...HA! If you want to actually buy a house, not just write offers and waste time, call Chris, plain and simple.<//text>

Hung is a great agent! He helped my husband and I purchased a home in Santa Ana. He was always available when we called and when we wanted to check out homes. The best part of this was he knew our financial situation and was able to negotiate with the seller to cover our closing cost! We love our   home now and we wouldn't be able to make the purchase without him. I would highly recommend him to anyone who is looking to buy a home!<//Text>

We are definitely glad that we went with REMAX for our first home purchase! Our buying agent was Hung Trinh and he was outstanding in leading and informing us about the entire home buying process.

As you can imagine, this will probably be one of our biggest investments that we would be making in our lifetime and it definitely helped to have someone like Hung to assist and walk us through the process.

Hung was attentive to our questions and he spent many hours showing us homes and was super flexible with our often busy work schedules. Many times, he would even show us homes late into the evening when we would be free from work. He also was not pushy at all and gave truthful advice, even if it meant him not closing the deal. He truly does look out for his clients and we are glad to have been one of his (and potentially in the future as well!)

Thank you Hung and the whole REMAX team for the smooth and easy process!</text>

Andrew is one of the best agents out there along with his partner. Andrew comes with the whole package of knowledge in the business, persistence in keeping his client happy and aware of every move taken, accessible every minute, and makes sure to answer any question or makes sure to get the answer. Not only does he have a professional demeanor, but he is also an affable person. No one could have made this process as easy and smooth as Andrew and his partner. I will definitely recommend them to friends and reach out to them in the future if need be. Thank you Andrew and Jose for everything! Wishing you guys much success.</Text>

<Review>Lamar is friendly, sincere and attentive.  Whenever I asked him a question he either knew the answer right away, had someone on hand to provide the answer immediately or got the answer within a business day.  He also has a great team and network that help provide a variety of services such as:  moving, utilities coordination and set-up, finance brokers, and inspections/appraisals.

He really is super helpful and keeps the anxiety of buying a home totally in control.< /Review>< Response>

Hung was very helpful from the beginning of our search. He’s a pleasure to work with. Easy to talk to and got answers to all the questions we had. I would also like to thank Monse who’s a part of Hung’s team. Monse helped with the Escrow and closing documents. She made things easy to understand and went over each and every document we signed at the closing table. Hung and his team are trustworthy and professional.</Review>

Alright so let me start by saying that I have had an awesome experience so far. All together Jeffrey has helped me so much with everything. I wanted to use my VA loan and he already knew all the answers to everything I had! Even if he didn't have the answer he would figure it out. I work late nights and  he is always available to answer any questions I had out of the blue. Everything has been smooth sailing! During house searching we put in an offer and I don't know how he did it but we got the seller to agree to just about everything! The counter was to good to refuse and so we decided to take it. Now I am starting escrow!!! Thank you so much for all of your knowledge!!! Such an awesome individual!<//Text>

I've been looking to purchase a condo here in Santa Ana for some time now. Hung has been helping me with the search and we finally met in person. As a first time home buyer, I didn't know what to expect. Hung walked me through the whole process and gave me a better understanding on what to expect. I am excited to be working with him to purchase my first home!</text>

Jose and Lamar are a great tag team! As we know the real estate market can be very demanding but these 2  were always there to answer any questions! Jose with a very high energy and motivated you to stay hungry in buying a home and Lamar bringing a slick, calm demeanor to help stay focused with nice to deal with! As first time buyers we needed both characters! Would 100% recommend these 2 to anyone, I’m sure the rest of the office is just as good!< /Review>

<review>Professional, informative, prompt, and delightful. These are just a few of the phrases that I would use to describe my experience  buying my home with Brittany. She didn’t make me just feel like a client but really like a friend who had my best interest at heart. She was with me every step of the way and She made sure that I got the best bang for my buck. I couldn’t be happier  for selecting her as my realtor and I couldn’t be happier with the home that she found for me. Thank you so much Brittany and may you be As big as a blessing to  to your many future clients as you were to me!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Agent Estrella Arellano (Ella) is very organized, she’s easy going and doesn’t pressure you! She’s very easy to get a hold of and listens to you. And because she listens to you, house searching is great and not a waste of your time.  It feels like your home search is a priority to her she is always so friendly, you never feel any push back or attitude. She is always very helpful.  Others like her and work well with her which helps us especially when its negotiating time.</text>

<Review>I met Jeffery Mcgonigle at an open house. Right away, I could spot his enthusiasm and found him to be very resourceful. There, he took the time to assess my economic situation and my expectations, and offered the guidance and the help that my family and I needed to become first time home owners. In  the weeks to come, Jeff followed up with us, sending listing after listing, maintaining open communication throughout the process. I am forever thankful for the persistent effort and positive energy that Jeffery has brought to the table! Thanks to Jeff and his associates, we are finally in escrow with the house of our dreams, and currently experiencing one of the happiest moments in our lives!!<//Review>< Rating>

HUNG TRINH is simply the best realtor! My boyfriend and I are first time home buyers, and obviously had no clue what we were doing. We required quite a bit of hand holding, guidance and insight during this process. Hung not only provided us with all of that, but was genuinely happy to do so and always provided quick and amazing service. He quickly learned what we were looking for and helped us find our perfect home. He works with a team of skilled partners and made everything as smooth and seamless as possible. He truly went above and beyond in every aspect. Hung will be the only realtor we work with moving forward and will receive every possible referral from us! If you’re looking for the best guy to help you through this process, Hung is the one! I can’t thank him enough for all of his patience, effort and support!</text>

We had a tall order to fill as we are a lRge blended family and he made it happen. He always goes above and beyond for us and did a ton of leg work to ensure we were getting exactly what we wanted. I am so impressed that for once we had someone who genuinely cared about our feeling as well as our hopes as opposed to someone pushing their own agenda. We worked with someone else before him and unfortunately that individual had his own agenda. Andrew is a exactly who we needed, so blessed!</Text>< Pics>

We were moving down south to Orange County from the San Francisco Bay Area and we really didn't know the area well and some of the caveats of the South Coast Metro area.

LAMAR , where do I even start explaining how great this guy is . Patient, caring and knowledgeable. It took me and my girl 4 months to find the right home for us and Lamar stayed working hard to make sure we found the right place . It was awesome working with him . He communicated with us frequently and always made sure we were comfortable before making any decisions. For anyone looking for a home, Lamar is the guy you should work with . I would reccomend him to all my friends and family.< /text>

Hung Trinh is a great real estate agent! I am currently working with him right now to purchase a new home. He went out of his way to pick me up and showed me all the homes I wanted to see. I am very picky with the home that I am looking for. He is super patient with me and is currently helping me find the perfect one! I highly recommend him as your Realtor!</Text>

<Review>This review is for Jose and Brittany, both of whom I highly recommend. I brought them in to help my parents sell the home they lived in for over 40 years, and to look for a new, smaller home in the area. They were very professional, knowledgeable and treated us like family. They were great about keeping me informed as my parents have never sold a home before and wanted my input. Jose and Brittany were also wonderful with explaining the process to my parents, answering all of their questions and ensuring that they were comfortable with what was going on, both with the selling of their former home and the purchase of their new one. It was nice for me to know that they were being well taken care of, and I am so thankful for that.

José and Brittany recommended a great contractor to paint and install carpet and secured a moving company when the time came. They did a wonderful job marketing the listing ahead of time and generating a lot of interest...my parents had 7 offers within just a few days! I’ve never had agents go the extra mile quite like these two.<//Review>< pics>

Although our process was longer than anticipated (mainly on the sellers part) Jeff made every step of the way relatively easy and smooth on our end. The only thing that I would say that would have made this whole experience better is if he was both the listing agent and our agent! He really was a gem, very knowledgeable, dependable and really a great guy all around. Thank you Jeff!!

Ps. We love our home! 🤗<//review>

Edit:
Coming back everything is all said and done and I know own my very first property because of Jose and Britney they are the absolute best.

< Review>
I'm one not to write reviews but it's a must to do so just by the amazing experience I had. To keep a long story short my wife and are first time home buyers. We had no clue in what we were doing. Our first Relator from a different company was just not listening to what we wanted and we felt pressured.

Then we met Claudia Negrete and Jessica Gugliotta and boy I'm glad we did. If you want someone to walk you through the process and truly sit down and give you full attention to your needs, look no more they are  the duo you want on your side. They are super easy to work with and very knowledgeable in their profession. They are not just looking to make a quick buck and put you in any home. They truly do care on finding your specific needs even if you are texting them at midnight. Truly made my family and I feel like family and turned our experience a total 360 degrees for the best. If your looking for a Realtor to sell or buy look no more because Claudia, Jessica and their team not only truly know what they are doing they treat you like family. THANK YOU for helping me find my forever home!!!!<//Review>

< Review>
We purchased our home with them and it was overall a great experience.  We wanted something very particular, and the realtors here listed to us and actually recommended great homes for us too see, we went into escrow after finding the perfect house on our very first outing with them.    In addition to all of that, they also got us the lowest interest rates that were offered to us with AFN which was their preferred lender and we quickly got approved and then closed the deal.  It was all very quick and easy, and most of all there where no unexpected surprises or hang-ups.  10/10 would use again and will definitely refer both services to our friends and family.  Thanks for everything!<//Review>

Focused on customer satisfaction, Chris is realistic and transparent on facts that benific the consumer. A huge advocate for home ownership & retention, you will only get honest answers & great service.

Using multiple sources to provide facts to the consumer, Chris is always focused on educating the client on making the right choice for their situation.  I endorse all the work they do for the consumer.<//Review>

My husband and I are so happy that we connected with Chris and his team to purchase our first home. The whole thing has been incredibly smooth and we are positive we are in good hands. He takes care of everything and has made sure we understand exactly what we are doing (I can't say the same for   our previous agent). Chris is always very accessible and responds to all calls/texts almost instantly. Chris, if you're reading this, when our transaction is done take a vacation and leave your phone at home! We consider ourselves blessed to have found Chris, and can't wait to open escrow!<//text>

As a first time home buyer, words cannot explain how glad I am to have found this team to help my family and I. I thought it was going to be a very stressful process but they made it very easy. Especially Christopher Giannos, he went the extra mile for my family. He was always available for our questions and showings. We went through two other agents but they are nothing in comparison to Christopher
and his team. I would recommend them to anyone who is looking to purchase a home.< /Text>

I should have used Chris from the moment I first spoke with him months ago. I tried to do it myself and failed and cost not only myself money but my family. If you want to sell your house call Chris and tell him Steve sent you. We had tons of problems a long the way and Chris never even batted an eye, he just found a solution and kept going. Well done Chris.<//review>

OMG what can I say about this team. Absolutely amazing, cannot possibly recommend anyone else to help you find your next home.
We had an amazing experience with Chris, Edgar and everyone and will be a lifetime client for sure.
Thank you guys for everything that you did and I can’t want to work with you on the next house :)

Highly recommended!!< /Review>

Chris has two speeds fast and faster... he really seeks to understand what exactly you are looking for and more importantly, why.

His knowledge of the southern California real estate market is unparalleled and extensive.

Upon finding you a home, Chris game plans with you exactly how to get that   home. His deep understanding of how to effectively negotiate goes much farther than other agents I've consulted.

Chris, you are the man!< /Review>

<review>Working with Chris Giannos was absolutely amazing! Most agents are looking to only close a deal as quickly as they can but not Chris. He's patient, knowledgeable, and understanding. He took time to truly understand my needs and educated me after recognizing my lack of experiencing to ensure I was making a informed decision. He's professional and truly cares about putting families in homes fitting of their lifestyle. I'll definitely be calling him when it's time for my families forever home.<//review>< name>

Ever since my first day, I knew what a great opportunity it was to be apart of this RE/MAX New Dimension Family! All the agents have such a wide range of knowledge of the industry and go so above and beyond to help each and every individual they come across. They put in 110% everyday, with such drive and passion to assist and guide they're clients and also each other. I love being in this office because the energy is so amazing everyone is functioning so fast with such high spirits! Team Adame makes moves! You can feel confident that  your expectations will be exceeded and your next home buying or selling experience can be one that you trust!<//Text>

<Name>Hilda Rahmann</Name><Time>1495811327429</Time><Rating>5</Rating><text>We have had a very positive experience working with Edgar and his office at REMAX New Dimension.  At first we were nervous about working with a realtor that was new to us and we knew little about.  Edgar quickly made us feel at ease and confident in his abilities.  He responded quickly to every phone call, e-mail, or text we sent him and always had an answer or a solution to any issue we presented.  Edgar went the extra mile to provide us with as much information as he could regarding the sale or our rental property and now, with the purchase of another rental.  The two transactions have gone very smoothly, with very little stress, pressure or work or our side.  Edgar and his team have taken care of everything and have kept the transactions moving quickly and efficiently.  Edgar is not only responsive to our every need, but he is proactive in identifying needs that may arise and in suggesting the best ways to take care of them.  We are very grateful to have found Edgar and will definitely call on him again the next time we need a realtor.  I would highly recommend Edgar as a knowledgeable, helpful, and responsive expert in his field.<//text>< Pictures>

I met Mr. Jose Samano from Remax and he was very personable and knowledgeable about the real estate market. It was not very long before I got a buyer and the sale of the house was assured. Jose helped me wade through the mountain of required paperwork but he was very patient and made the whole procedure go smoothly.
If you want to buy or sell your house, do yourself a favor and have Jose help you do it. You will not be sorry.

I was in a rush to buy a home because my parents were coming over but I was so busy with work. Hung took care of everything fro beginning to end. He helped looked for the house and negotiated for us to get the best deal He would Coe to my work to explain how everything works for me and took a lot of his time out to make sure the process would go soothly. HE got us the home we wanted just by the time my parents arrived. Even though he already got us the house he is still checking up with us to make sure everything is going well. He is a great agent, who truly values his work and I am glad I found him to help us!< /Text>

Hugo is the man! I worked with him on a transaction recently and he was able to get our buyer in escrow with his first offer, even in this competitive market. His communication and professionalism throughout the transaction were always top notch. Highly recommended if you need an excellent Orange County Realtor!< /Review>

<name>Dean Arizabal< /name><date>1565496451451</date><rate>5<//rate><Review>Hugo Pompa and Jeffery Mcgonigle are two of the best guys you could ask for when selling and/or buying property. Not only are they cordial and professional, they are also brutally honest...and that's the way it should be. Home selling and buying can be overwhelming and frustrating, but also satisfying and worthwhile. Hugo and Jeff are easily accessible and helpful (answering texts and calls at all hours of the day) listening to concerns/questions and giving recommendations/advice. We understand that those in the real estate industry (realtors/brokers/lenders/etc) are in it to make money, but I have always felt and believed that Hugo and Jeff are looking out for our best interest. Even after the sale and purchase of our previous and new homes, respectively, they have been there for us. As a recent example, we had a plumbing problem. Guess who was there to help answer questions and be there first thing in the morning with a plumber?...Hugo and Jeff! Also, we have kids. Hugo and Jeff are caring, thoughtful, and very accommodating people that made everything work when we had to bring our kids along (showing our property, house hunting, filling out paperwork, finalizing deals). I would definitely recommend them to anyone that's in the market to buy or sell. I already tell all my friends and family about our experience, and how they should look to Hugo and Jeff for the same experience. They fulfilled their jobs, successfully helped us sell and buy our homes...but they are true friends to us, like brothers!</Review>< pics>

The RE/MAX New Dimension Agents are the best!!!  They were able to sell our home immediately after listing it.  We are very pleased with the whole process.  Miriam and Alexis handled the escrow diligently while Edgar was able to communicate accordingly with the buyers agent to make it a smooth and pleasant transaction.  The open house was very successful and generated multiple offers thanks to their RE/MAX Realtors David and Hugo.  We are very grateful and pleased to have chosen such a dynamic team of realtors. It has been a superb proceeding and we highly recommend the Adame Team to negotiate your future real estate ventures.  Thank you for making our sales experience a success!!!</review>

I didn't know anyone in the real estate industry here and honestly felt a little lost and upside down. Chris was the   first person I met (through Zillow) and he gave me hope I'd meet some other great people here with his friendliness and professionalism. Chris listened to what I wanted/needed and found me the perfect condo in an area I loved in just a couple days. He did all the scheduling for me and made viewing the condos really easy. In the end, he found me a condo that had only been on the market for 8 hours. We snatched it up quick! Sorry y'all, I got to it first! :) After that I had a couple questions on all the closing docs I had to fill out and he helped us with everything we needed to get me through the closing process. Great agent. Great experience. I would definitely recommend him to anyone!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

On New Year's Eve, at 7:00 PM I was browsing the Zillow app on my phone and found a piece of land that would be perfect for my construction yard. I called the number listed and someone from zillow picked up and asked if I wanted to talk to an agent, I was surprised and said yes...I was connected   with Chris and immediately impressed with his knowledge of the zoning codes here in Santa Ana. This is not my first time working with a realtor and most times I'm telling them the codes. The lot ended up being zoned exactly what I needed so we wrote up an offer! I look forward to Chris representing me again in the future.< /Review>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>Buying a home is by far the most intimidating experience we’ve faced, one that we anticipated would require a substantial amount of time and effort.

Referred to us by a friend, we contacted Mr. Jeff McGonigle of Team Adame Re/Max to be our guide in this seemingly daunting process. Electing Jeff to be our agent turned out to be the wisest decision in this entire process! With his help and guidance at every step of the way, this daunting task became a seamless, quick, and most importantly, enjoyable experience.

Jeff was great through the entire process. He was able to put together a list of amazing properties that not only met our financial and locational constraints, but also our personal taste.  When we finally found our dream home he was diligent in making sure we got the best deal possible. We feel that Jeff really treated us as family and that he had our best interest in mind every step of the way.

Jeff’s amazing personality and calm demeanor were instrumental in moving the process forward. There were no obstacles that couldn’t be surpassed, and all problems had solutions. Mr. McGonigle was always a phone call or message away- it truly feels like he runs a 24/7/365 operation!

We are deeply appreciative of Jeff’s diligence in making this possible. We absolutely recommend his services to anyone looking to purchase a home!

Thank You Jeff for all your help!< /Review>< Pics>

I am looking to buy a home to use for Air B & B. I spoke with Hung Trinh, he provided me with a lot of details regarding the guidelines and which cities still allows Air B & B. A lot of these info I did not know. Thanks to Hung, because if I bought the home and can't use it for what it was intended for, I would have lost out on a lot of money.<//text>

Edgar Adame and his team were incredibly helpful. They walked us through the home buying and selling process step by step. They answered  all questions my wife and I had, and always made themselves available. I couldn't ask for a better realtor, Edgar's team had a personal touch with  very  professional results.</text>

If you were to look up Chris Giannos in the dictionary, there would be two definitions (as he's a very ambiguously talented individual). Definition 1: arguably the most intelligent, well read, savage realtor in all of the County of Orange. Definition 2: A close confidant, friend, and advisor for years to come. Meeting Chris through Zillow was pure luck of the draw in my opinion, although he will attribute it to the massive amount of money they spend on advertising (take note potential sellers). I will continue working with Chris indefinitely and would happily shout his name from the rooftops in hopes that anyone currently working with a realtor would ditch the zero and get with the hero. Chris, you're my hero......kidding, but in all honesty THANK YOU!<//text>

<review>We would like to thank the REMAX team in Santa Ana California for their professionalism in handling the purchase of a Condo in Santa Ana Ca. We would highly recommend The Remax you to anyone who is purchasing or selling a home in Orange County.
A special kudos to our realtor Jeff McGonigle who works hard, is dedicated, and an overall great guy to work with.
Also, a big shout out to Jennie Rios, mortgage consultant for Americap Direct Funding who was able to get our loan approved and closed on our condo in record time 15 days.

To a great group cheers!!!!!
Thank you....”

I was able to connect with Mr. Giannos through Zillow and was immediately impressed with his local level knowledge and candor. Being self employed, I was under the impression buying a home was almost impossible. THEN, I met Chris...Not only did he clearly illustrate that it IS possible, but   educated me every step along the way. Although we haven't put it together 100%, we are very close and I felt the need to share my story. If you're looking to buy ANYTHING at ANYTIME call Chris. If it's a house, he's your guy...if it's anything else, he probably has a guy!<//text>

<Review>My realtor was Chris Giannos, so this review pertains to my experience with his services:
Overall, I was not at pleased with his work on my behalf.
Things started off well enough, in that he was willing to visit any home of interest promptly. One early issue is that I felt strongly pushed by him to look only in the Santa Ana area, in spite of my expressed interest to try to look for something similarly affordable in other areas. I don't know if this was intentional, but it felt that he didn't work hard to find homes that met all or most of my criteria.
I made an offer on one home through Chris' in-house lender, but I later found that their rates were not very competitive. I was disappointed to discover this, and switched to my own choice. I assume there is some sort of cut that Chris' office gets from this arrangement, thought they assured me this wasn't the case. Regardless, someone is taking more money than is typical.
The home that I ended up buying, I found on the MLS site myself. It was an area that he had never discussed, despite it fitting all of my criteria (price, distance from work, safety, home size, etc.). I pointed it out to Chris, and he promptly joined me at the home. I feel like I did the creative work of finding an affordable home that fit my other criteria, but I thought that was part of what I paid Chris for.
So, I decided to make an offer, which was an easy process, due to all of the e-documents and such. The offer was accepted. Conditions of sale included the seller doing some work. The terms of this arrangement were not appropriately conveyed to me. After all was said and done, the work was completed 2 months after we closed. This means that I paid 2 months of mortgage without living in the house. There was never any mention that it would be this much of an inconvenience, nor was there any mention of financial compensation.
On top of this, I didn't even get the keys until over a week after closing the sale. This is something that Chris should have taken care of on day 1, from my understanding. Instead, I couldn't get a hold of him, and had to go through the listing agent to figure out what happened. Strangely enough, Chris just decided to get the house re-keyed a week after close. The action is normal, but the timing was odd. The lack of communication was frustrating.
I also didn't learn any unique details about the home from Chris' office. I would think that they would dig into renovation history, price history, etc. This is my first home purchase, so maybe I'm just expecting too much, but if I'm getting no unique expert perspective, I don't see much value added beyond processing documents and getting access to tour homes.
Another issue that I had to deal with was that the work done on the house left it in an unlivable state (carpet was cut and lifted, and left there). I was not told this would be this case. Chris did nothing to handle this until after I paid to have this fixed out of pocket. This was all after spending 2 months of mortgage and not living in the house, so you would expect a more sensitive approach from your realtor. I really felt like I was left hanging as soon as the sale was closed.
There were just a lot of things that added up to a less than pleasant experience, and at the end of the day, I don't think Chris offered any value beyond the absolute basics: visiting homes and handling the signings of documents. I had to spend quite a bit of effort to monitor or manage many stages, which was very frustrating. 2 stars for being able to close the deal and negotiate the work, but the missing 3 are for nothing else going well. I recommend you look elsewhere for an agent, based on my experience.<//Review><rate>2< /rate><Resp>None<//Resp>< Pictures>

I had the opportunity to deal with the this office on a few real estate transactions and all I can say is they are  one of the top offices in the area for Real Estate services.
They seem to understand the current market and the challenges.
Very experience staff. Knowledgeable and professional.
I strongly recommend Remax New DImension, especially for First Time Home buyers because of the way they explain and handle the process from start until they give you the keys of your house.<//review>

Great experience selling our home with the Adame Team at Remax New Dimension. Our house sold in one week.  Edgar and his team listened to our needs, then met and exceeded our expectations.  They were there for us throughout the entire sale and escrow process.  I will definitely recommend them to all of my friends and relatives.</Review>

I worked with Claudia Negrete during my journey on a house purchase. I was discouraged with all nuisances of real estate and it's new requirements.  CLAUDIA was calmed and comforting to my 1st purchase.  In addition, she was fully available with my calls, tours request, and I totally felt that she acted on my behalf.< /review>

Hugo and Jennie are rockstars! They were both so prompt and made the homebuying experience painless! For a first time homebuyer, they were a perfect team and made me feel very comfortable with the process. Plus, they were always available to answer any of my questions (which there were a lot of). Would highly recommend Hugo and Jennie to anyone who wants to close on a home quickly!</Review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>It's difficult to say what makes Chris a standout in the vast sea of realtors in OC. Having worked with several agents in the past, I've got a pretty good idea of how sub par these people can be. Chris completely changed my perspective on what to expect. From the second I contacted him, I was blown   away by his responsiveness, genuine interest in assisting me, and unparalleled knowledge of the market here in OC. Not only was he able to list and sell my property for a record price in the community, but worked with me to clearly illustrate how to net as much as possible on the back end. Regardless of where you are in Orange County, Chris's marketing ability and more importantly sales skills will go to work for you in a way no other agent can. Thanks again Chris, I found not only a realtor for life, but a friend.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Edgar and his team are very professionals, they guided me to the process of selling my home procuring multiple offers and getting me more than what I was asking for. They priced my home just right to get the activy and timing as I needed, I love the fact that they kept me inform at all times during the process and facilitated documents and signatures utilizing docusing.

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Words cannot express our DEEP appreciation for our amazing realtor HUGO POMPA & our wonderful loan officer CARLOS PEREZ. Hugo was professional, FAST, QUICK thinker & problem SOLVER when it came to purchasing our first home. He made all the RIGHT moves (no pun intended lol) literally to get us in our new home. When we thought there was NO way of possibly seeing ourselves in our new home, Hugo took initiatives to conquer one thing & that was to make myself & husband home owners. We could not thank Hugo or Carlos enough! Our realtor was referred over to us from our loan officer CARLOS PEREZ whom did his job to a "T". Professional at what he does, Carlos made sure all our i's were dotted & T's crossed which made the process that much easier! This whole process is what EVERY client would want for their experience at the end..SMOOTH!
