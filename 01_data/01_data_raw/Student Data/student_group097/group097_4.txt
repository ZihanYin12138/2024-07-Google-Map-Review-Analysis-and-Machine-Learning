Super polite and caring staff asking very kindly for anything you need. We got one of the pan house menu items which is the the signature plate of the restaurant and it was one of the best foods I’ve ever had in my life. Keep it up guys< /review>

However, when trying to place an order for pick-up the website indicates the restaurant is only taking phone orders and when I did attempt to call (for over 30 minutes) their line was busy. I informed the hostess upon my arrival, she stated she had no idea why the phone wasn't working would mention it to her manager. Also, the website shows one version of their menu when it is an extremely limited in actuality. It was very disappointing being that I'm not from area and made the almost 1 hour drive to learn I couldn't order my favorite items. Please fix your phone issues or update your website. It could've save me a trip.< /Review>< Pics>

1st Impression:
From the outside it looks like it got a lot of space but once you go in, you realize that the space is only long but not far in. Making larger groups hard to be seated.
Other than that, the bar area and overall ambiance is nice and clean.

Food Impression:
The Pan Roast here is ok but I've had better in other places.
This one still cannot compare to the Oyster Bar located inside Palace Station in Las Vegas.
The heat numbering is a joke. I ordered a 7 while a friend of mine ordered a 8 (1 to 10), we both barely got any heat on our Pan Roasts and Gumbo.

Price Impression:
The price is about the same with other places that serves the same type of food but because of the lack of quality, it's just ok.

Conclusion:
Better save your money and try somewhere else than here. The cost is not worth trying an ok place for Pan Roast.<//Text><Rating>3<//Rating><Gmap_id>0x80dd2143cf92ab6b:0xd7bc543c8625f45a< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Ritter me this, Batman!

What do you get when you cross an owl with a bungee cord??

............................My ass!! BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Free appetizer with any entrée purchase coupon

Ritter's Steam Kettle Cooking serves up authentic Creole cuisine, utilizing individual jacketed steam kettles to evenly cook food at varying temperatures.  I've had this place on my radar for awhile now, and lunch seemed the perfect opportunity to stop by.

While the restaurant seems small, the table & bar seating can accommodate around 30 people.  Flatscreen TV's had international soccer & soap operas for my viewing pleasure.

A complimentary crusty bread roll w/ butter greeted me as I gave the menu a once over.

For my free appetizer, I went with the deep fried bacon wrapped molasses marinated shrimp & mozzarella with molasses mustard-
Bacon & shrimp, two of my favorite food groups.  Large, tender shrimp wrapped in smoky, fatty bacon, with a delicious mustard for dipping.  If that's not enough, gooey mozzarella cheese just for the hell of it.  Some hot sauce kicked up the molasses mustard to my liking.

For my entrée, I chose the clam pan roast (spice level 7)-
Tomato cream base with Cajun trinity & jasmine rice.  A rainy day comfort food.  Rich, hearty, stick to your ribs kind of dish.  The level 7 spice level was just right for me, providing heat while still allowing me to taste all the bold flavors encompassed in the bowl.  Plenty of sweet clam swimming in the tomato broth, a scoop of fluffy rice wading in the middle.  My only complaint, and it's more a personal preference, is next time I'll ask for rice on the side.  Reason being is that I'm not particularly fond of soggy rice.  As I got down to the last few bites, the soggy rice grains became unappetizing to me.  But, the large portions & tremendous flavor have made me a fan.

Beignet with chocolate whipped cream-
I've only had beignets previously at Ralph Brennan's Jazz Kitchen, and Ritter's seemed more dense & textured.  The chocolate whipped cream was ambrosia to me.  With a liberal slathering on top of the fried dough calorie buster, the flavor was heavenly.  Perfect way to end the meal.

Service was great.  I was attended to promptly & had plenty of soda water w/lime refills.  Parking is metered in the front, with a structure available nearby.  The parking structure is only $2 for the first two hours.

C'est si bon!  Ritter's Steam Kettle Cooking offers delicious Creole cuisine in a relaxing atmosphere.  I'm highly anticipating coming back & trying their other dishes such as jambalaya & chowder.  Besides beignets, Ritter's also offers bread pudding a la mode and that has my undivided attention for my next visit.

Highly recommend!

One of my favorite Cajun restaurants ever. Highly recommend the fried okra, chowder fries, and the blackened salmon salad. If you go during happy hour the appetizers are a couple bucks cheaper and you get to try everything they have to offer. Excellent service, super attentive server and chef. Loved loved it!<//text>

House pan roast is amazing, fried soft shell crab is on point. Beer is cold, Food is amazing. Atmosphere is good, sea food joint kind of feel. Young staff so more of a hip/relaxed vibe. Would try again.</Text>

One of the more unique food experiences you can get in downtown Huntington Beach. It is sort quaint (small) but one of the few places with counter service where lone diners can eat without taking up a table and stares of other patrons. The service was very attentive and helpful. I had the pan toast and had the chowder before and intend to get the gumbo in the future. Of the 2 I have had, I prefer the chowder, but it appears the pan roast is most everyone else's favorite.< /text>

Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. Took the time to explain the dishes and the process for making the meals. The food was excellent and very reasonably priced. We ordered the fried okra, the chicken and shrimp gumbo, and the bread pudding.  The only suggestion I have for any of the food was a dash of salt to the gumbo.  Highly recommended!<//text>

Came on a Saturday night. Small cozy place but there was space so we didn't have to wait long. Servers seemed overworked or preoccupied. We ordered a seafood kettle and an appetizer. We had to ask for bread as apparently it doesn't come with any. The food was okay but we likely won't be coming back. Better options elsewhere in downtown.<//review>

Great type of food for the cold weather and large portions to share. Food is unique and delicious. The style of cooking on steam kettles is so interesting to watch and it keeps your food hot longer without over cooking it. If you haven't tried it yet you should!!!<//text>

I had the Cajun Calamari and the New England clam chowder bowl which were both very good and came in a good enough portion to share with another person. I also had the Diablo shrimp pasta bowl which was also big enough to share. It had 6 medium shrimp, about a 20 count/lb size and I had it at an 8/10 heat level. The prawns were a good texture, not overcooked and the heat level was nice and not overpowering. I will say that they red sauce was very basic and left me wanting something more complex but that's not to say it wasn't good just not great. I finished up with some beignets for dessert which were made great, fluffy and crispy on the outside but still slightly doughy and soft on the inside with a pocket of air.  These were served with plenty of powdered sugar and a light chocolate mousse which topped them nicely.<//review>

Kinda of a smaller place but kid friendly. They have a descent but small selection of beer and wine. The bowl are large enough to share and their appetizers are a highlight if you have a few drinks. Nice place, is come back. There are not too many steam kettle restaurants around and they have done a good job with the menu options</review>

It was slow when we came in,  so I can't really speak to overall service.  However,  with that said, my service was excellent.   My order was make incorrectly and it was remedied quickly.  I had the cioppino. I would say it was no more than a 4 out of 5.  I think that's fair due to having had much better broth than this and the white fish is a muddy tasting lake fish (that just doesn't belong in a ocean based soup, in my opinion).  However,  I enjoyed it.  The sweet tea was also very good and my cup never went empty.   I wasn't blown away and I would come back if someone else wanted to go.<//text>

Great place and waiter was awesome! I had a shrimp po boy, which was proper and awesome and a few beers.  Waiter was tall friendly Asian dude who was on point in suggestions and service.  Others can learn from his example.  It pays to just basically be friendly. And the great food helps< /review>

Fabulous authentic Cajun food! I know, because I lived in Lake Charles 8 years. Get the bouillabaisse roast. It's a cream sauce made from the pan roasted seafood, filled with a variety of seafood. I always come here when I visit Huntington Beach.💓💓💓<//review>

Tried this place on a whim; was in town for business. Had the combo pan roast...just what I was looking for! Staff was great, beers on tap, and they had the game on. Can’t wait to try other dishes.< /Review>

I've passed by this restaurant this many times and never knew that it served Cajun food. I love Cajun food so when I found out, I just had to try it.

I got the jambalaya and my friend got the gumbo.the food came our surprisingly quick for Cajun cuisine and I was a little wary, but it was all for naught.

They give very generous portions and it was delicious all the way through. They didn't skimp on the meat and it was very flavorful and had a nice spicy kick to it. The meal was priced very reasonably for the portion that they give you.

Overall, definitely recommend it to anyone who wants Cajun!< /review>

Pretty good place for a southern taste.

The restaurant is a bit small, holding maybe 40 people at most. It's a cozy place though. They have nice decor and have their cooking stream pots lined up along the bar. It actually gets kinda hot sitting at the bar when they cook.

The food was good. We had their oysters and their house pot roast. I felt that the oysters were fresh. The pot roast was good as well. The amount of lobster and shrimp was substantial and it tastes overall very good.

Overall, it is a bit pricey but it may become my goto place for oysters.</review>

This was a really unique experience as I'd never been to a place with steam kettle cooking and they have several of them lined up that they use to prepare their liquid based entrees. Overall, service was good and the food is flavorful! If you love seafood and food that has soul, then this is for you!</text>< pictures>

Our food was good. Our server was pleasant. However they close at 9. But by 8:15 they started putting the chairs up on the bar. We tried to order desert but they had already shut the kitchen down. This was odd because the Huntington Beach street fair was going on and people were everywhere. Basically I am disappointed in feeling pushed out before closing.</Review>

Best Cajun food in Huntington Beach! Try the Ritter's Famous Pan Roast. It's actually Cajun Seafood in Tomato Cream with Rice. Delicious! They also have all of your standard New Orleans food such as Jambalaya and Gumbo. Actually would be a good date night sitting at the counter watching the cook using the steam kettles.<//Review>

<review>This place needs help. I don't understand why businesses like restaurants promotes and spend advertising dollars but not provide enough staff to man the place when they have the costumers start coming in. Costumers waited and leave because of the long wait, costumers that's been seated don't get service and those ready to pay cannot find their server. Even delicious food taste bad if the service is lousy.< /review>< UserId.>

Food is a bit expensive but it's really delicious! I always get their jambalaya or their specialty, pan roasts. Soo soo good with so much flavor! I like to sit at the counter and watch them cook because that alone is a fun experience. That's if you're into cooking and kitchen designs.</review>

A friend invited me out to this place a couple weeks ago to expand my tasted buds.

Since then, I've been back 2 more times. Great combination of choosing your level of spice and what football game you want to watch.  Come early or wait for a spot.</text>

Would have never found this place if it wasn’t for google. It is truly a hidden gem ! The house pot roast is heaven !! The spice levels are not extreme I got a 6 out of 10 and it was very mild for me but all around I will forever be thinking of this place ☺️</text>

<Text>Honestly, if I could give zero stars I would. My husband and I usually go to the Santa Ana location but decided to give this one a try for our anniversary dinner. We were very disappointed. Staff was extremely rude. We were told to sit wherever, and someone came and tossed the menus on the table without saying a word. The host also reached over me twice, once was over my purse (very uncomfortable for me) to get something on the counter in front of me, second was to hand my husband bread but he did so over my plate instead of walking to where my hubby was sitting, not once did anyone say excuse me. The food also tasted horrible, not at all how it should taste, they also got hubby's food order wrong, he ordered the gumbo with everything in it but pretty much only got fish and an odd piece of chicken. We will never return to this location. If you want to eat at Ritter's PLEASE go to the santa ana location!

Wow... the HB location ...server was nice, but service was terrible...one server, one cook and one other guy on the sidelines... to handle the ENTIRE restaurant. Food was ok... definitely gone downhill since they opened... $90 tab for 2 people and the whole experience was quite disappointing....won't be back.</review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><text>I really enjoyed my whole experience here. Not only was the food delicious but the atmosphere was fun and inviting. We sat in the bar area, which I personally love because it is very close to the steam pots that they use to cook the gumbo and pan roasts. Like the other review says, it does get really hot from all the steam but it smelled great as well. We got oysters and the seafood pan roast. Both were delicious and enough to more than fulfill the appetite of two fatties. They are also presented very aesthetically so get your instagram ready! The price is mediocre, pretty much the same as any other southern cajun restaurant.  ~$20 for the house panroast (highly suggested) and $18 for a dozen oysters.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80dd2143cf92ab6b:0xd7bc543c8625f45a< /GmapID></record>

Very good for a fast casual bite of Cajun country. If ordering the gumbo or jumbalya I recommend going with a 6 or 7 on spice to add better flavor< /Text>

<Review>Yeah boi!!!  I was so excited to try Ritter's and I commented how similar this place is to the oyster bar in Las Vegas. Well there is a connect since Mr Ritter had experience at the oyster bar. I was so excited to try some of my favorite dishes except without oysters.
You can never go wrong with seafood and booze. The only downfall I didn't realize there was free street parking so I ended up paying for parking in the lot. Bummer but now I know to look around. This event was smaller but it was filled with "great service" which usually means cute waitresses but it was both the literal and figurative meaning. You can't beat service with a smile. I also enjoyed how every dish was explained to us and served family style. So much food! Don't worry it’s okay to indulge during the holidays we have until next year to make resolutions.

I enjoyed the fried shrimp and various soups. I enjoyed the seafood noodle but the gumbo and pan seared orange soup the best. Also adding habenaro peppers was both a hot and enlightening experience. Hello! Forget coffee put a little habenaro in your food and you won't be sleepy.<//Review><Resp>None</Resp><Time>1458947182079<//Time>< name>

<review>Good selection on scrubs, they carry all sorts of good brands. Staff is friendly. Only downside is they don't open store on the dot... They may run a bit late, so don't try and be there early.<//review>< pictures>

< Review>
I love this place there are so many scrubs in this store. They have a variety of scrubs from cheap low price scrubs to the more high end expensive scrubs . I really do recommend on buying the scrubs that are more expensive they do last you a long time and they are great quality. The employers are very helpful as well ❤️ I saw a scrub shirt I really liked but they didn’t have my size so they called another store to have it be brought in to there store so I can be able to come back and pick my shirt up. I also made a request for them to hold my uniform so I can come back the next day to pick them up and the worker had no problem in doing so.</Review>

Came here to find some scrubs of course. They have plenty of brands to choose from which made it nice. Only problem was that they didn’t have too many scrub jackets which made it really hard for me to find an entire set so i had to leave a try else where. Great place to go if you only need too and bottoms but if you need an entire set i recommend trying somewhere else</text>

<Text>Great selection in scrubs, the staff is very helpful. They have 3 fitting rooms and always have the newest trends in scrubs. They have other necessary accessories for the med field, like shoes, stethoscopes, badge reels, etc. Great spot to shop all your needs without going to multiple places.<//Text>< rating>

<Review>The most unprofressional place ever, do not shop here. Items are charged differently as to what ththeththey are labelled.  I was in a rush didn't pay attention till I walked out but returned the very next day. They wouldn't let me return the items and then they said maybe i asked questions in the wrong Language "English" , the lady was only speaking to me in Spanish so I spoke Spanish to her. After asking that ignorant question I spoke to her in perfect English and told her language was not the issue and how dare she ask or blame language as the issue. DO NOT SHOP HERE<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

<Review>Very friendly staff but limited sizes and style for men. They were helpful enough to special order a few items but return pollicy is only for store credit even if items were not used with tags still on them. Prices are cheaper else where but I figured gas makes up for it not having to drive far because it's only a few miles from my house.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

< review>
Cute hostel in a great location. Clean bathrooms, with good fresh pastries and french press coffee. Unfortunately, we arrived in our room, and our bed were full of sand. We immediately alerted Eric, who was kind enough to vacuum the floor, change the bedding, and offer us a 15% concession on our stay. Unfortunately, during checkout, another member of the staff said it was impossible to get a concession given that we had booked through an online agency. Mishaps happen - however, making a customer promise that you can't hold is unprofessional.< /review>

Love love love this hotel! Stayed here for 3 days and totally enjoyed the hotel. So close to the boardwalk for beach fun and shopping and restaurants. Everything was nearby. French chocolate croissants for breakfast were delicious. The gals at the front desk are so sweet and helpful! Even got to visit with the owner as we were checking out! Will stay here again.< /text>

< Review>
My boyfriend and I stayed here for our trip out to LA and we couldn't have chosen a better place to stay. We stayed in the Abbot Kinney Suite, and it was a great experience. The suite had an open separate bedroom with desk and dresser with night tables on each side and a living room with a fire place. There was a cute kitchen with a deep sink and a claw foot tub and nicely tiled bathroom. The suite had windows everywhere and had massive amounts of sunlight. When you stepped out there was a balcony that overlooked Rose Ave and Venice Beach. (BEAUTIFUL) We sat our there often drinking and enjoying the view and atmosphere of Venice. The staff and owner were super nice and accommodating. The street was semi busy during the day and quite at night. There is a lot of restaurants around and the boardwalk is only steps away. The street parking was great. We always found a spot in front of the hotel. We came there to visit all of LA but just ended up stay in the area and keeping The Rose as our home base. Totally recommend staying here if you want to be away from all the crazy of the city and live like a local.< /Review>

This hotel is pretty awesome. I was lucky enough to get a tour of the hotel in October 2015. I loved the 'vibe' of the place. The downstairs rooms are funky, clean, fresh and really unique. The shared bathrooms are great and these rooms and bathrooms have really nice homely feel to them. If you get a chance to stay here, you should. I loved the fact that the accommodation ranges in price and can suit a range of needs and budgets. The suites upstairs were awesome. They each have amazing views and really well laid out apartment style accommodation. The area the hotel is in is so great. The Rose hotel is is the ultimate LA experience.<//Text>

<review>Excellent few days as guests of The Rose Hotel!  Within feet of Venice Beach we enjoyed easy access to three days of surfing.
Around the corner were two of our new favorite breakfast places; The Rose Cafe and Gjusta.  Dinner was Mediterranean at the Dunes Venice.  Also within easy walking distance for my daughters and I.

The Rose Hotel staff made easy conversation out of insider tips.  Our day wandering Abbott Kinney for shopping was fun and informed.  “Check out Rag and Bone” !

Rooms decor is hip and clean.  At different times we had three family members in different rooms as we converged our activities.  Everyone agreed we were on to a “find”.< /review>< pictures>

We loved this place. It describes itself as "Down to earth" but "chic" which is spot on - the basics done well. Great coffee, croissants and newspaper reading in the front room in the mornings. Lovely staff.<//Review>

<Text>Absolutely loved my stay here. The staff was beyond wonderful and friendly and fun!!  This is also a perfect location, close to everything!! Parking- we were lucky and found street parking pretty close both nights we were there. This is a great hotel! We even saw a commercial being filmed right outside our window one night!  Loved the atmosphere and people here, highly recommend.<//Text><gmapID>0x80c2bace9a3c341f:0x3b8cceb8a988e1a6< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

This hotel is very close to the beach and shops which was nice. My biggest problem is that there was no parking, unless you could find some right outside the hotel. Since it is so difficult to find parking you have to pay to park over night which can range from 30-40 dollars. For the price a night this hotel charges you would think they would supply more parking. Overall it was clean and cozy, but I would much rather stay some where that had an easier parking situation. Because the parking lots are out of sight from your room and it is difficult to come and go if you plan on driving any where.< /review>

Everything was awesome! I stayed in a queen room with a shared bathroom and really loved the experience. My boyfriend was visiting from Oregon for a few days and I wanted a nice, relaxing and cute place to stay and I found the rose that exceeded my expectation above and beyond! We were so happy there and loved our experience! We didn't mind the shared bathrooms at all as they were always clean and well kept. This will definitely be our go to getaway to stay at when we are visiting la area. And the cherry on top was the French press coffee and amazing croissants in the morning. The hotel room was very simple but with so much character and comfort. There wasn't a tv in our room which was perfect bc we just wanted a place free from technology and to focus on each other! And the front desk- Emily, was a doll and we were very grateful for her kind personality and suggestions on places to eat. This place is a must to stay at if you want something relaxing, simple but with so much warmth. Thank you for the wonderful experience Rose Hotel. We will be seeing you again :)</review>

Bunched little stuff.  No night manger if the is a problem, even though the State requires a night manager if you have 11+ rooms.  There is no hotel parking, so If you are unlucky enough to not find street parking, you are stuck with a $30-45/night parking tab - which is what happens in the summer and weekends. they tell you they have a deal with the parking lot across the street, but you can cut a deal with them for $30/day.  The 'hotel deal' is $15 day+ $27.50/night.  Best to negotiate your own deal with the adjacent parking lots.

The basic rooms are really small, with a sink and the toilet/showers are down the hall.  Within my comfort zone, but not most women.  The soap/shampoo dispenser had fallen off the wall and it was interesting juggling a 3-soap dispenser while showering.

The hotel is 20 yards from central Venice Beach, so be ready for noise.  Although the they supply earplugs.

It is very clean, the staff is nice, but they have many managerial  items to figure out.

A bit more work and experience and I am sure they will bump to 3+ in a year or so.<//Review>

I highly recommend this hotel.  Its in a perfect location near Venice Beach.  Great customer service ,  everyone is so nice and they go out of their way to help you before you even get there they email you asking how they can prepare for your arrival ,  they are very helpful with their knowledge of the area as well.  We got the room with shared restrooms/ showers and I didnt know what to expect but everytime I needed to use the restroom or shower ,  one was always available and always clean and they have the best shower.  so nice !   Our room had a door to the breeze way which we loved.  We had a sink and mirror in our room and a great fan.   Just such a lovely place and great vibe there . It was my daughters 21st bday and they had a card for her on the night stand,  so nice !  We will stay there next time we are in town for sure.  They also offer affordable bike rentals , and loan out beach chairs etc....  adorable place!< /review>

<review>The complimentary breakfast, consisting of delicious croissants and french press coffee, is the highlight.  The location is superb.  The interior design and decor is contemporary Kinfolk hip to an extreme.  But keep in mind that if you are booking a room in the east building you are getting a hostel or guest house room (the most expensive guest house that we have ever stayed in), with shared restrooms and showers accessible in the hallway, which can be a bit misleading by the 4 star hotel rating.<//review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>It's a super sweet hotel in a great location too the only reason for not giving a 5 star is because the walls are super thin and the building quite creaky. They do warn you on their website though.</Review>< Response>

I was expecting an actual hotel with private toilet and shower. I was surprised when the staff showed me the shared shower room and toilets. This makes peeing late at night a lot more inconvenient, especially when the bedroom door uses  ordinary keys instead of an electronic card system. I didn't really like the experience.

For 200+USD I think this is not very worth it. Next time in Venice Beach I'll try a different hotel.</Text>< Rating>

I was in love with the staff girls, but it was the only thing I can imagine made this place a 4 star hotel. It's unique, it's special, and it is a kind of  experience you should try, but the rooms can't be compared to a normal 4 star hotel room. The floor is wooden, the rooms don't have own bathroom, and the place is more like a weekend house than a real hotel. Forgive me, if this experience is common on the beachside, but I was amazed, after staying in hotels in the citiy center. Maybe the problem is with me :) And don't get me wrong, I can recommend you this place, but be aware of the circumstances.<//text>

If you want to enjoy venice it's the right place to come. Service was super nice and always helpful with any doubts we had. It also has additional services as surf classes, bike rentals, etc. The rooms were not too big but very well equipped. The only thing that I missed was a bathroom inside the room. You need to share the bath and the showers with other guests but I never had to wait to use them and they were super clean and nice.

If I come again to Los Angeles I'm sure I will stay again in The Rose Hotel!<//Text>< pics>

This hotel is NOT 4 stars as advertised on Priceline. The room is smelly, bathroom and shower are shared with 15-20 other rooms. I haven’t seen anything like that for the last 15 years. It’s more of a homeless shelter at best not a 4 star hotel<//Text>

Overall it's an average hotel. It's worth the 4 stars mainly because of the location in the middle of Venice Beach and close to the boardwalk. However in terms of service and amenities vs cost its not really worth it.<//text>

(Translated by Google) Although very noisy and not cheap, but great staff. All take their job first and take care of the well-being of their guests. My room had only a window to the light shaft and shower / WC was in the hall, but I really, very much. Good design, nice details like Aesop shower gel and body lotion.

(Original)
Zwar recht hellhörig und nicht günstig, aber tolles Personal. Alle nehmen ihren Job erst und kümmern sich um das Wohl ihrer Gäste. Mein Zimmer hatte nur ein Fenster zum Lichtschacht und Dusche/WC war auf dem Gang, trotzdem hat es mir sehr, sehr gut gefallen. Gutes Design, schöne Details wie Aesop Duschgel und Bodylotion.</Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) A paradise for a sporty holiday and relaxed lifestyle. Very attentive staff, nothing is lacking and one is persecuted by the feeling of being at home. The view of the Pacific is indescribably beautiful. One would like to stay forever.

Ein Paradies für sportlichen Urlaub und entspannten Lifestyle. Sehr zuvorkommendes Personal, es fehlt an nichts und man wird von dem Gefühl verfolgt, zuhause zu sein. Der Blick auf den Pazifik ist unbeschreiblich schön. Man möchte am liebsten für immer bleiben.</Text>< pics>

Knowledgeable staff. I bought a lot gear from them. No complaints at all. It's usually not busy at all so it's a great spot to make a quick stop for all your vaping needs.< /text>

I've been coming to Vapor Planes for years. I got -- and still get -- great vibes from everyone there, especially Sam. There's no elitest "bro culture" around this place like there is at some others.

Even better, the staff always knows their stuff and makes great recommendations for vape juice and mods based on your preferences. I'll be a customer here for as long as I live in the Bay Area.< /text>

Had a great vape setup in store with package deals
For all the accessories. Service was great and made sure I knew how to set up my device first time. Rewards program is an added bonus and I got a coupon in my email for 5 off my next purchase. Overall a great experience.<//review>

Hands down best vape shop in the tri-city area. Great selection of juice and equipment from entry level to advanced. awesome staff and owners, super down to earth and always willing to answer questions/give advice. Independent, locally owned and chill as heck. Oh yeah... the sushi place next door is kick ass too!<//Review>

<review>This is my favorite vape store- the guys are so patient and totally helpful. They have excellent sales on vape juice and a huge assortment. I appreciate the fact that they have knowledge of their products and if I need coils, they are quick to place an order if they happen to be out. Highly recommend this place!!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Time>1521836460100< /Time><Rating>5</Rating><text>I've been going to vapor planes for a few years now and there are several reasons why. First, Sam and the rest of the staff are great at helping you find what vape setup would work best for you, second, they know their product really well, and third, they are always very welcoming and accommodating. These guys really want you to be happy and they go out of their way to educate folks on new products and vaping in general.

Some vape shops I've gone to act like used car dealers for some reason, and luckily Vapor Planes is far from that experience. Vapor Planes is a fantastic shop with good vibes all around.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Review>Wish I could give 0 stars. Could be a great place though, showed up and they were closed. Maybe google and yelp have there hours wrong. Showed up at 920pm on a Friday, says their supposed to be open until 10. Lost a potential customer. Vape shops please stay open late for those of us who have to work late!< /Review>< username>

<review>Great products, the customer service is top notch. Sam has been working with me through changes.  After switching jobs and moving Sam has been shipping me my ejuuce and its fast shipping.  I would pay a little more for a device or juice just because I've had years of fantastic customer service from Vapor Planes not to mention a great selection of products!  VP by far is best vape shop I've been to!  Thanks to Sam and Moon for a great vape experience !<//review>< Pictures>

<review>Solid place for tasty Cantonese desserts or snacks, like buttered toast, sago, instant noodles with spam, and popcorn chicken. Each dessert is around $4~$8. Don’t come with a large group, or you’ll be waiting for a really long time. The service is poor, but I don’t really blame the staff. This joint feels more like a simple hangout spot than a restaurant or cafe. It helps if you can speak Mandarin or Cantonese.

Mango sago to-go is the best item. When they put the dessert in a cup with a straw, you get a much more blended flavor when you’re drinking it.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNsgvFvPGib1GB9CEFW2Z4QHUNVFUy6NyasptJb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPG-5Q1mV6R35_AyEb_8bSDUuoEVGgKksijSFeN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxaQA5sQrOg7iFPazHVcUCuoZ8ADe3G4drucSn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Name>

One of my favorite Asian dessert places in the city offering a large variety of sweet vs savory light bites and Chinese desserts. What's great is they are open late and the price is right. Whenever I go there it's almost always packed and the service really isn't great.

We have tried a number of things on the menu and you really cannot go wrong. The past visit we got these curry balls which were ok, ramen, basil popcorn chicken and mango slush with sago and fresh fruit. Everything was really tasty and the popcorn chicken went really well with the curry sauce. We inhaled it. So good.

When in the city, we must always go here to try.< /text>

< Review>
A local boba tea establishment in my neighborhood also has lots of other kinds of sweet treats and goodies. I had the coconut milk which was completely delicious; really strong coconut taste with icy slush to complement it. My wife had the green tea ice cream which was also very good. Usually this place is packed with lots of schoolkids from the area. On this day they were not as busy so we were afforded much time to enjoy the ambiance. They also offered us hot tea in addition to what we ordered. Will definitely go back for the coconut milk if not something else on the menu.<//Review>

Yummy desserts! I got the mango sago with coconut milk, which seems to be one of their most popular dishes! Knocking off one star because I felt it was kinda pricey for such a small dish.</Text>

They need to update their prices.  It's about twice as high as listed in the menu on line but still good for SanFrancisco.   It was so low on line i had to check it out.  Most sandwiches were about 3$ now about 6$. They are on sliced regular white bread with the crust cut off. Tasty but a tad small.</Review>

<review>Always a pleasure to eat here. Nice late night desert eats with moderate prices and quality. Staff rotates sometimes but usually decent servers out there serving. Lots of hot and cold variety along with nice classic snacks like french fries and popcorn chicken.

Come with friends, cash only.</review>< Pictures>

<review>My second time here. Definitely a good place to go when it's late and there's nowhere else to sit, have a drink or dessert and catch up with new and old friends.
If you're not a fan of Asian style desserts though, you'll be disappointed.
The fresh juices are good, not overly sweet.
The HK style milk tea is a bit tannic and could do with some sweetness.
Haven't tried any of their savory options but would be up for trying them.</review><Gmap_id>0x808587627f586a95:0x9b37fee4eeebbdbe<//Gmap_id><Time>1578624733972</Time><user_id>109034237984405933022<//user_id><Rating>4< /Rating></record></dataset><record>

A good variety of Hong Kong tong shui made with simple ingredients. Reasonable pricing. Definetly the best in the area, although it's far from the stuff you'd get at Honeymoon Dessert. Usually a wait- there are only three working staff. I would recommend the red bean tapioca drink if you're looking for something unique. Sago is good too. The sweet sesame soup isn't the best, however. Also, I wouldn't recommend any of the savory stuff.</text>

Great little Asian dessert place with many choices of sago and fruit. I come here with my friends during late nights when I am around the Sunset. I enjoy the tea and the quick service by their workers. The staff are friendly and attentive to customers. The place is usually filled on the weekends, so be prepared to wait a few minutes to get a table and the place is cash only.< /text>

<Text>Try the watermelon sago! It's very refreshing and delicious. They load tons of fruit into it so your are for sure getting your five-a-day no doubt about it.

If fruit sago isn't your thing, they have tons of other sago and sweet desserts that are a must try. It reminds me Hong Kong and eating at all the dessert shops.

The servings are so big that I don't finish most of the time. You never have to worry about them ripping you off with teeny tiny serving sizes.

The waitress is really nice. The moment you sit down she brings over cups of hot all for your whole party before you even say anything to her. Love it!<//Text></record>

<review>This place always has some crazy line at night, especially in a weekend.   We got lucky and when we got there,  no line and 2 empty tables.   We were seated quickly.   About 5 minutes later people are writing their name on the clip board.   There's a 20 minimum for using credit cards.   We waited about 10 minutes to order.   There was one waiter for the entire place.  He took orders,  brought your food,  seated people,  cashier, and cleared tables.   It was insane and he was smiles the whole time.   Service was bad but considering there should have been 2 or 3 other people working I'm going to tip him will.  The desserts were good, we didn't order from the food menu but a lot of people did.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x808587627f586a95:0x9b37fee4eeebbdbe< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Pretty full menu with anything from drinks (non-alcoholic), snacks, and main dishes. I've only had milk tea and popcorn chicken with the popcorn chicken definitely being above average. Reasonable prices, though they do have a $20 minimum for credit card charges.< /review>

<Text>Customer service was not their best quality here by the way. We seated ourselves and waited a while to order, get our food, and check out. Parking can be difficult to find here as well.

The restaurant was a little small. I would estimate that the maximum capacity was 20 people.

In regards to their food, I would say it's average. You get what you pay for. I got the coconut milk with grass jelly (I believe) and it was recently sweet. Not over the top which was a good midnight snack. We also got popcorn chicken. It was nothing special and had to season it with this spicy Japanese powder.

Would I come back here? Yeah I would. The food here is affordable.<//Text>< gmapID>

Hk desserts, amongst other things. Desserts are not overly sweet. Fair price. Open late. Younger crowd. Refreshing change from just getting boba all the time. There can easily be a wait.<//Review>

They have a good selection of desserts. My favorite is the lychee with sago. They have good portions and the price is adequate.  I'm giving it three stars though because i went at night 30 mins before closing and my dish looked like it was just slapped together. The snow was already melted and the lychee we're just thrown on there.  Disappointing how they just didn't care at the end of the night.<//review>

If I could I would give this place 0 stars. Was told it was close 30 mins before closing time. CLOSED 30 MINUTES BEFORE CLOSING TIME and yet they were still serving people who literally sat down not even 1 min before we got there.

Closing time is at 12 not 11:30<//text>

<Review>Like Hong Kong Kowloon, Golden Island serves Asian desserts but with a much smaller menu and restaurant space. There was a short wait on Thursday...very strange indeed.

Despite fewer toppings as options, I prefer Golden Island because they use less sugar.

Would highly recommend the mango with sago and coconut milk, add rice dumplings. Yum!< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>The atmosphere is quaint and the service is friendly, but this cafe is very expensive.  I paid $3.15 for an 8oz cup of coffee with NO refills.  This is not a grab n go coffee place like Starbucks, it is a restaurant style cafe like Mel's Diner or Original Joe's....no refills on coffee at a reataurant for $3.15???

It's Asian dessert! They have sago and toasts and is so good. I believe this is hong kong style or may possibly be taiwanese or both. My favourite thing is the salt and pepper chicken wings.< /Review>

Golden Island Cafe is mainly known for they're desserts. They have sago and a variety of main dishes such as noodles and sandwiches. It is a good dessert place to go to when you are feeling bored. The service there is a bit slow and isn't up to customer's expectations. But, overall it is a good experience!</review>

Cash if under 20, otherwise they accept card. If you have a favorite item or specific craving, best to call ahead to see of they are still serving it.</review>

Great for decently priced desserts or savory foods for late night cravings.

Food is delicious and home-y

The place is small and can get quite crowded.</Text>

The Camp has been an amazing place for me this past year. I have struggled with my diet and exercise my entire life. I’ve tried crash diets, gym memberships, personal trainers, and nothing has given me the transformation I have seen with The Camp. They build you up, welcome you to the community, and care about your longevity. The trainers are amazing and these people have become my good friends!! I can’t recommend this place enough. Thanks for all you have done AFF!!<//text>

I absolutely LOVED the CAMP...I was so not motivated n needed a boost, tired, lazy, and in pain from being out of shape so I joined the 6 week challenge. It kinda forced me to go, I mean paying a certain amount of money got me invested,  .....then I realized how the trainers keep you going, ....they ...know you by name, ....they motivate you, make toy believe in yourself, ....its a family, new friends, without partners and no judgement... .....the change seemed slow n challenging at first but I made 19 lbs... ..so much better energy, stamina, better food habits, n now I joined for a YEAR.... I ...cant say enough, I've seen so many people there making such amazing strides,  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TRY IT...ITS WORTH EVERY $$$$< /review>

Had a great time at the camp!  They kick your butt, and you'll ask yourself what you're doing here, every day.   But the hard work is worth it ands you'll get fabulous results.</Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>I’ve been at the camp for a year now, and it’s been a life changing experience for me. The trainers are awesome, Daniel and Ricky are always challenging me to become a stronger person. Ive learned from Ricky that “you get what you put out”. The Simi Valley staff is awesome, but I do have to give a shout-out  to Alex, she always has a smile and will make anyone laugh. She takes the time to get to know you, and will give you that extra push when working out.<//text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
If you want results and you enjoy work outs that are the perfect level of challenging at whatever skill level you are, go to The Camp! My husband did the 20 lb challenge twice and took me to their Pack the Camp day and I loved it! I decided to join for 4 months after 2 months of giving birth and at the end of my membership I weighed less than my pre-pregnancy weight. The trainers are awesome and they do a fantastic job motivating you, not to mention everyone is very friendly and inviting.

For those concerned about the price, I thought it was a pricy membership but when I went to other local specialty gyms, such as Orange Theory and pilates, The Camp turned out to be cheaper because you can go to all the classes every day for their base price (1 gym location). At the other places you would pay up to $80-$100 more for that same unlimited privilege.< /Review>

This place is the best. Everything on their menu is amazing. They also have the best AYCE deal. Customer service is great and the owners are very nice and hospitable! This is the sushi spot!< /Review>

I came here because reviews were saying they had good portions and good pricing. However, I was a bit disappointed when I got my meal.

I ordered one Beef Udon and my husband ordered the Joe's Roll. The udon was not a traditional Japanese udon and the beef was more like potroast.

The roll was really small, especially for the price. The tables were sticky and the atmosphere was really awkward and claustrophobic. In addition, they don't follow COVID seating regulations.

The older man (who I assume runs the restaurant) was really rude to my friend. My friend tried to order a kid's meal and the older man kind of scolded him, saying it was for 9 and under. However, the age limit wasn't stated on the menu.

The younger waitors are nice, but that's not enough of a reason for me to return.<//Text>

Sushi is always good from here! Owner is easy to communicate with & understanding.  It can get very busy here & they are following CDC guidelines with staff and customers k wearing masks. Outside at night they have patio heaters for customers :)<//Text>

<Review>Good rolls and a diverse selection. We especially like the Succubus. The service was very slow the first time we went but we've been back a few times and it's much better. I'll be taking friends next time. Outdoor seating was pleasant and the variety was great for the all-you-can-eat price.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><rate>4<//rate><gmap_id>0x80dcb1089a7eb78d:0x7145ccc2551dffad</gmap_id></record>

Ordered for take out and on their website says $7 sushi and so we ordered a couple of sushi. When we paid, we questioned why the sushi was now $8. We told them the website says $7, but they said they forgot to change the price on the website. I kindly asked them if they can honor the price and he said no. So I I put a big 0 zero on the tip line.</Review>

Only one star for the service. Nice but not attentive. As far as quality if I could give negative stars it would be minus 5. Save your money don't do it!!! Only plus is $1 beer with A.Y.C.E< /Text>

I arrive at this outstanding restaurant many times  as I like the ambiance that is characterizes this place. The staff is highly friendly and well trained. The service is certainly fast. Needless to say, the food you eat is good. I frequent many times and I was never disappointed. The pay is honest. I highly recommend this restaurant to to all.</Review>

<review>Terrible service! Waited 45 minutes for a table just to be told that there was list, instead of being welcomed and informed about the list right away. Empty tables remained dirty long after patrons left them instead of being cleaned right away so people would not have to wait for so long. Patrons at their tables were complaining about the food taking too long as well. They have lost my business!<//review>< Pictures>

<text>Restaurant is under new management. Sam the new owner is amazing took really good care of us. Sushi chef Peter served us some delicious Sushi and fast. I wish I could give it more stars but sadly I'm limited to 5. My girlfriend and I have been here once a week since the new ownership and can't wait to go back again.< /text>< Rate>

Tokyo is gone. I will miss their eclectic menu as the new place is more sushi and tempura oriented. After coming every other week for past 3 years started comparing other restaurants to it. Nothing lasts, tears in the rain...<//Review>

So went to this place which is now known as VIP Sushi because it is under new management, and just like prior management the staff was rude. We had dinner on the most notorious holidays of all times, Valentine’s Day, and we were ignored for a good 20 min at the door. No one acknowledged us or even made eye contact to offer us a table until a server eventually came by and semi wiped down a table and seated us. We decided with the all you can eat but they never brought us what we ordered and they only served ya twice in the whole night. It was very disappointing because considering my husband and I had long days at work and were so looking forward to this night, to be sadly disappointed with the service of this joint. This place is committing high way robbery for hard working individuals. Our night almost ended with a $75 bill because they charged for 3 all you can eats when it was really two for my husband and I and our 3 year old son who had nothing to eat yet they were still wanting to charge for him. The server eventually brought the bill down to $50 but only because I complained that we were only served twice. Please save your money and do not go to this place. Very rude servers and awful customer service.<//text>

Once or twice a week for us.  Bento box and a roll and we are good to go.  The staff is awesome.  Very helpful, very welcoming.  If they make a mistake and then rarely do, they make sure they make it right. Food taste great and fresh.<//Text>

Sushi restaurant is Under New Management. Now called Sushi VIP. All you can eat menu is so delicious. Wide variety of appetizers n sushi. So in love with the Japanese ramen soup. New owner Sam is the best host ever.<//Text>

It's a small place. It's a mom and pop shop! But the food is delicious and they are very friendly and willing to help you out. They even do take out!< /Text>

< Review>
This is hands down my favorite and in my opinion the best sushi restaurant I have ever been to. The guys that run this place are so awesome, they always remember my friends and I as well as our normal orders. The lunch special is an amazing deal, miso soup, ginger salad, and two full rolls of your choice. Got out of there for less than 20 bucks. Not to mention the quality of the food. The only thing I wanna do once I leave is to go back. ;)< /Review>

<Review>The smell of good Italian food when you walk through the front door is overwhelming! The taste of the food and their spaghetti sauce does not disappoint. We've been regular customers here for years and it's the best value in the area for good old fashion spaghetti. Family owned and managed, great for take out and large parties too!<//Review>< Pictures>

The sushi here is always fresh and well made. You can also order delicious food from the kitchen. There are quite a few creative rolls but my favorite is their lobster roll. The pricing is moderate and the decor is plain, but good enough. Quiet atmosphere and overall lowkey dining. The weekend hours are not great, but always open for dinner.< /review>

Hands down one of the best sushi places I have ever been to. The sushi is always fresh and delicious, you can see them clean and make the sushi right in front of you. The service is great, very rarely slow, and when it is slow it is always worth the wait for their delicious sushi. 5 star.</Review>

The food looked good, but everything was bland and flavorless.  The miso soup was essentially hot water, the chicken teriyaki didn't even taste like chicken and even the coke was flat and not good.  Great service, but the food is not worth it.  I've paid less elsewhere and had way better food.<//Review>

< review>
We went here for Udon soup and a Bento box with chicken katsu, crunch roll, and vegetable tempura. The food here is ok. The service is a bit slow. The waitress was very nice but I dont think we would go back here knowing there are other great places to get udon soup.</review>

<review>Don’t order from this place on GrubHub,

They won’t update their time on the app, they won’t let you review their restaurant because they always cancel your order.

These guys are just a mess.  I loved their food, (even though it’s stupid expensive), but they just don’t care about anyone who is requesting delivery and they won’t remove themselves from the app.

Not going to order from this place again.<//review><Resp>None< /Resp><rate>1<//rate>< Pictures>

My co-worker and I found this place when we were going to the Thai place next door. We noticed the Pho shop and decided to give it a try, since it was a new restaurant for us and we both enjoy Pho.

The interior was casual, but not sloppy.  Very clean with a relaxed atmosphere.  The staff was helpful and always had a smile.

The Pho was very good, and the veggie plate was fresh and crisp.  The broth used was outstanding and the meat in my bowl was extremely tender and tasty.  I don't always find the meat in a bowl of Pho to be all that tasty at most Pho restaurants (maybe it's the way they cook the meat; maybe it's the fact that the meat has been boiling too long and has released all its flavor).

This Pho restaurant was an exception, as the meats were tender and flavorful.

My co-worker and I will definitely be back, as we have added this restaurant to our short-list of places to dine while in the Mountain View/Sunnyvale area.

The only reason I didn't give Luv Pho 5 full stars is that they do not offer a Bánh mì Sandwich, which is a wonderful sandwich to experience if you haven't.  Add some Bánh mì sandwiches to the menu and this would be the perfect Pho hot spot.<//review>

It would be better if the bean sprouts had been blanched before, and the side dishes were adequate.

點了招牌"Luv Pho" 牛肉湯蠻鮮美的, 還有一顆貢丸. 如果豆芽菜有先燙過味道會更佳, 配菜給的還算充裕.<//Text>< pictures>

They work as a team to prep the house covering the sidewalks and pool.
Good clean fast workers that are skilled and well organized . I had a problem with a couple of bubbles on the door and they sanded and
repainted. House looks great.</review>

<Date>1607626532055</Date><Review>Great team all around!! Owner Brendan was able to get me a quote right away and helped me to save money by letting me know the fascia on the exterior of my house was in good condition and did not need to be painted! I definitely appreciate that honesty. Rhiannon from the office was quick and responsive in answering my emails prior to booking the project. Miguel and Nathan who came out to paint the exterior of my house were awesome! They did a very thorough job and I could not be happier with the outcome. I feel bad they came out the week of the first heat wave to hit San Diego in August ... But they did such a good job! They made sure they addressed any concerns we had and we're satisfied with the final work. Would recommend them and book them again for another job!</Review>< response>

Great company but decided to hire another painting contractor who was willing to start right away and was slightly less expensive.  Their high prices are the only reason they did not get five stars. Thank you McCarthy Painting for your professionalism in trying to earn my business!< /text>

McCarthy Painting was very easy to work with.  They did an excellent job and cleaned up everyday.  They also worked continuously and did not have days in between where they worked somewhere else.  Painters were detailed and listened to our desires before starting.  Very happy with choosing them.</Review>

Painted exterior & stucco patched, our beachside home. Had needed updating as we were readying to sell. We got expert, custom advice. Got help in also small jobs like painting pots, trellises, & other outdoor fixtures. Came out great! We sold the house in a few days- thx McCarthy Painting !<//text>

< Review>
I recently had McCarthy Painting & Finishing paint the exterior of my home and one interior room. The crew was prompt, courteous and left the workplace each day in a neat and clean state.

The quality of the exterior job was fantastic and the crew regularly communicated about any questions or issues that developed.  Definitely a 5-star job. The place looks great!

The interior room proved a bit problematic as we were covering a dark color with white. After multiple coats I was informed that there would be an additional charge to continue and cover the remaining bleed-through. Brendan was professional and courteous and we negotiated a reasonable extra charge for the additional materials and time. I greatly appreciate his balancing the need to make a reasonable profit with holding to the original contract and meeting my expectations. So despite the technical issues, I am quite satisfied and also consider the interior job to be a 5-star rating.

I would definitely have McCarthy back for any additional painting needs.<//Review>

We used McCarthy Painting for our condo.  Customer communication was very good.  Estimate for the job was detailed. They reviewed the project in person prior to the job. They also used precautions for the Covid- 19  situation.  They did a great job.</Review>

McCarthy Painting was able to give me a quote via email using pictures of my cabinets. It was the most reasonable quote out of the highly rated companies. The painters were friendly, professional, and quick... They finished a day early! (They quoted 4 days but we're done by the end of the third.) Just be sure to ask about the cost of filling any holes (e.g., due to changing hardware) because that's not included in the contract.< /review>

McCarthy offered the most competitive pricing for our work. Brendan was accommodating and understanding. His crew was communicative and offered great advice when we were choosing a color for the deck. We were impressed by the quality of work. Brendan also stood by the work after it was completed. Where other companies penny pinch on every detail or change you want, Brendan was easy to work with and so were his crew.< /Review>

<Text>Great job–the crew was friendly and very professional. They were excellent painters, prepping thoroughly and carefully protecting plants as they worked. They were also very patient with my color selections (Sherwin Williams was, too!),  resulting in a terrific new look for the house. After new windows were installed, they returned to touch up tiny scrapes. Best of all, the price was reasonable, considering the work they did. I'd certainly recommend them.</Text>< pictures>

<Review>Working with McCarthy Painting was easy and painless. I called Brendan to do some work at my condo duplex and within 24 hours I had a fair price quote in my hands. His foreman, Julio, and his crew showed up when they said they would and were easy to work with. The work included painting exterior wood accent walls, a metal carport and some stucco repair. The work was completed in three days which was ahead of schedule. That painting work was excellent. I wish the stucco patch matched the existing finish a little better but I understand it is a hard finish to match. I would definitely use them again.< /Review>< pics>

McCarthy Painting transformed my home in just one week it went from a rotting, peeling, faded old beach house to a stunning “like new” home. Jesus and his crew were so helpful, willing to go the extra mile to make me happy and satisfied. If you need fresh paint, from the BEST in San Diego, look no further. Thanks guys!< /Text>

<rate>5<//rate><user_name>Kami Evora<//user_name><Review>McCarthy Painting painted the exterior of our house in July 2019.  We highly recommend the company!!  They gave us a fair bid - in the middle of three bids we obtained.  Our painters, Jesus and Jose, were extremely efficient, timely, hard-working and professional.  Their attention to detail was excellent and they asked thoughtful questions and followed up until the job was perfect!  Unfortunately, they were short one or two painters to assist them so our one week job was extended to about 8-9 days but they worked hard and it certainly was not their fault that they were short of manpower.< /Review><UserId.>111707234531692310127</UserId.>< Pics>

We needed our entire house painted on the inside before we moved in. (We were moving across country so coordinating everything was not easy). I explained to McCarthy Painting what needed to be done. I was fortunate that they were able to get me in their busy schedule. The team showed up as scheduled and finished on time. The work was well done and we are pleased!!!!< /review>

McCarthy  painting is a thorough and professional painting company. I would know, I am a licensed contractor and know what it takes to complete a job in a competitive trade. The workers were professional and thorough, taking time for detailed work. While I didn't hover, I did inspect their work daily to be sure they were handling all of the items that had been agreed to as part of our contract. A professional company will always welcome your review of their work as it helps ensure your satisfaction in the end. While I did find some items that I felt needed some improvement,  McCarthy addressed each item and completed their work to our total satisfaction.<//Review>

Very satisfied with Brendan McCarthy and his crew. I believe they are the best painting contractor in San Diego!  Professional, on time, meticulous work, excellent communication and fair pricing.  Follow up e.g. touch up post project was also outstanding; I could not be happier.

<text>I am a pro painter and remodeling contractor.  I worked for Brendan McCarthy in Austin, TX, for several months until his decision to cease operations in Texas and return to California.  Brendan is a generous, likeable guy who is honest and trustworthy.  He also utilizes brilliant methods that can offer you both superior enamel finishes for your home's doors and trim, and a faster job completion time.  If I were a San Diego resident, he would be my go-to guy for residential repainting.</text>< GmapID>

McCarthy just completed painting the entire exterior of my home. The job turned out great, they were on schedule and had great pricing.  They stand behind their work.  My neighbors commented on how great the house looked & my neighbor next door (zero lot line) said the painters were very polite and respectful as they needed access to her yard to paint.  I highly recommend McCarthy< /Text>

< Review>
We had a very positive experience with McCarthy; from initial quote to completed job.  We had just installed all new interior doors and woodwork including door frames, base molding and crown molding.  McCarthy painted all the trim as well as the ceilings and walls.  The job was done while we were out of town.  When we came back we found a few things that needed attention.  Nothing major, just things we would have caught had we been home.  We called McCarthy and they promptly set up an appointment, came over and rectified everything.  We highly recommend them and will definitely have them again.  Oh, and their price was very good.</Review>

McCarthy Painting is Our go to company for painting our rental properties. From single family homes to multi unit complexes they do a great job. They make their timing very predictable making my job easier when having to coordinate with tenants. The results are great and our clients are very happy with the work.
I look forward to using them again.<//review>

We hired McCarthy Painting & Finishing, Inc. to paint our master suite when we moved into our new house. They did an excellent job! We were able to request the exact paint/manufacturer that we wanted and the team went above and beyond to make sure every little nook and cranny was painted considering there was a lot of hard to reach places in the bathroom behind the furniture etc. There were some places where the previous owner user silicon-type sealer that paint would not stick to, so his team used some products to treat those areas to make sure the paint sticks. This was 2.5 years ago and the paint job is still in excellent shape as new. Would definitely highly recommend their service and go back to them again for future pain needs.</text>

Hired McCarthy painting to repair the crumbling stucco on my fixer-upper about 3 years ago and had them paint the entire exterior of the home too. They did a fantastic job - couldn't believe how well they matched the pattern to how it was originally applied! However, I recently reached out about a few areas of concern due to some settling from the house. Had zero issues scheduling an appointment, and though McCarthy really shouldn't have repaired it due to it being no fault of their workmanship, they were kind enough to fix it up anyway since it was still under warranty. They even repainted the touch-ups that same day. I was beyond pleased with their work, responsiveness, and attention to detail. Will be recommending to anyone that needs similar work done on their home - excellent customer service, great value, and honest people.</review>

This park cured my kids boredom from the smaller parks in our area. The playground is super big and has tons of things to climb on. They also had a dog park, a covered picnic area, and 4 locked door bathrooms. The kids had a blast splashing in the water after getting hot on the playground.< /Review>

Love this disk golf course. US women’s disk golf championship was recently here so the course got cleaned up and OB lines are clearly defined.</Review>

<review>Springview park has everything. They have a dog park small and large, a state park, a bike park with dirt Mounds behind the skatepark, a water park for kids and a Frisbee golf park! Haunted Mansion they have the usual park benches and playground for kids. This park is huge and a lot of fun by the way they have bathrooms!< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpshJobLrdCq83I02pAN2r0veJzLjiPDktGt7_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOV0G_eVISQ5ymi3VeGSkuf-ya8jkj5cKH1EZAc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxzhHVGXHoxlFe0VeiPtrbO1RVA_8mGCMOf4Vy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIbnibkSejfxdMJt60KbznuzBDdsSf8AciSqTg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOABjE86f8MaBz7lxNOFls8UtGrdebqZDevSXcj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtls-BB35wfmlOMUO16cmbggbW2i8Qg6epSzwC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

Lots of space. Great for running and there is a separate park for dogs. Only downside imo is all the frisbee golfers who smoke and make the air all smelly< /review>

< Review>
Beautiful park grounds to walk around, just watch out for the flying frisbees. This park features a very large frisbee golf course - I didn't even know that was a thing outside of Golf Story. The course is laid out amongst beautiful trees, along a creek, and setup around some fields. You are welcome to walk through the area, just be aware of very fast-moving frisbees flying around. There is also 2 playgrounds, including one for toddlers. But the star of this park is the frisbee course.</Review>

<Review>I grew up coming here, and loved running around the playground, going to the Rocklin Jubilee, and going to the library. I took my kids here for the first time, and the first time I've been back in who knows how long. This place has changed so much, but in all positive ways. I think the playground has been redone, the splash pad is so fun, but it's still the same nostalgic park I remember. It makes me miss being home< /Review>< name>

<Text>This park is a good size with, multiple play areas for kids and a dog park. It also has a water park, that's just been added in that's a decent size. It has a large picnic area that is very well shaded too.

I just think like most parks it could use more teater totters, and merry go rounds.<//Text><gmap_id>0x809b1f69f0a71c93:0xed30079bf344deb8<//gmap_id><username>Iona Kellison<//username><Pics>None</Pics><time>1599166991070< /time><Resp>None<//Resp><userid>109237437765577141088</userid>< rating>

There's a huge dog park, hiking trails all through the trees, a playground, disk golf, skate park, basketball and (i think) tennis courts, splash pad right next to a huge picnic area with a lot of tables and built in barbecues. They have a lot of events at this park from movie nights to food truck mania to live music, there's always something for everyone here!<//text><name>Heather Fox</name><time>1601320938539< /time><Resp>None< /Resp>< pictures>

The dog park turned out to be my favorite so far. Beautifully landscaped. Sprinklers, pools, and agility course all under the shade of oak trees.< /Review>

Tennis courts (marked lines for paddle tennis too), basketball court, roller hockey ring, bike/skate park, 18 hole disc course (frolf and there is a rental and purchase shop on site), two huge dog parks (1 for small dogs, 1 for big dogs), playground for smaller and bigger kids, walking/running/bike trail in and around the entire park. Nice big open grass area. Nearby football field (not sure its a part of the park system but people use it). And yes bathrooms which are kept clean.<//text>< pictures>

Plenty of parking except when events are held I would recommend to walk, bike, uber or get there early.  I love playing the 18 hole disc golf course.  Beware of hole #3's water hazard and bring plenty of fluids in hotter months because it will take time to get through the course (about 2 -2.5 hours).<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Nice park, something for everyone. However, major renovations occurring. Bathroom facilities are a mess. Portable toilets available, but be careful they may be a bit rough on nose. They are not clean and provide no water to wash hands. Basics.
It will get better.<//Text>

Nice disc golf course. One thing my friend who was with me today said is some of the basket place signs are missing there letter location for the hole.
Hole 17 the sign is completely missing.
Should be something checked on.<//review>

<Review>Great dog park, only downside is it's bark instead of grass, so when they all get running it can get dusty. Disc golf course is super solid, though I'm baised as it's my home course. Overall pretty great park.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>This is an old but great park venue, today we were there for a reserved event in one of the covered picnic pavilions.  Thank goodness we had the cover to to May rain.  We used the grills for our bbq potluck for 50 or so people.  We had plenty of seating and taped down table cloths for a cleaner food area.<//review>< pics>

A wonderful place to spend at least a couple hours every weekend. My nephew loves the spot and I enjoy the sheer size of the place. You can have a BBQ, play some field sports, take your children to playgrounds, basketball courts, tennis courts, a dry hockey rink, a skate park, the disc golf course, or on a walk about the place.

Just watch those discs!<//Text>

<text>This place was so beautiful! I stumbled across this park eith my boyfriend and we walked through a few different trails and relaxed near the creek. There was a historic Native American grinding rock slab throughout the trail and it was really interesting to be there and see it. There was a hockey arena, huge fields, tennis court, basketball court, skate park, and a playground. Place is so cool!<//text>< Pictures>

Tennis courts, basketball courts, beach volleyball, running path, picnic area, covered pavilion, skate park, skate rink, large field, and even a Frisbee golf course.  Always seems pretty clean.

The really nice thing about the park is that it has a bark base which is great when there has been recent wet weather. Most dog parks are muddy during this time. Also, the large oak trees keep the park shaded when the conditions are bright and and warm.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Love this place. Discgolf course is amazing. Just wish people would pick their cigarette butts up. There are trash cans at every spot. The scenery is so relaxing. Skate park for kids baseball field on the other side of the park. Nice dog park with water fountain for dogs!! Set up nice and convenient for people!!</Review>

Good dog park.  Fair size.  Bark is unique ground cover, but VERY dusty.  Only one water station and only one water bowl and only one pool.  Water in bowl and pool is always dirty due to the very dusty bark.  Also, the pool and bowl at the water station are messy to empty because the small drain is often clogged with bark creating a dirty pool.  People are generally friendly.</Review>

< review>
They have a pretty big dog park and a moderate sized playground. They also have a nice disc golf course that can get busy on the weekends. Careful if you are going to walk around the trails in the area as there are lots of frisbees flying everywhere! There is also an unused track and football field nearby as well.<//review>

All five star brah.
A community park where the city made an open space for real people. Besides all normal stuff like kid play ground, picnic benches, bathrooms, tennis courts, street hockey, dog park and the best of all a real fun disc golf course. The City of Rocklin did it right.< /Review>

Great carnival, one of the ride operators was definitely on heroin. Lots of bruising and track marks on his arm. Everything else was great clean fun.<//text>

Rocklin is a unique place. Small town feel, but it's really not small. This park is absolutely beautiful. The kids love to play, and there's plenty of room for a bbq. The creek that runs on the back side is loaded with fish. Something to do for everyone young and old.< /Text>

This park also shows movies on some fridays on big screens. Its got lot of green area too which sort of vools the eyes. Its in a quiet neighbourhood and away from the cacophony of the city.

<text>This park just happens to be close to us so we go to it, its got a lot of grass to run and play in the playground is in the direct sun both for other and youngest ones so it's usually to hot to play there. Not enough seating close to the playground its self. Should have a water splash pad its more for the dogs.<//text><user>104689194831185653273<//user>< Rate>

< Review>
This is a great place for picnics, ballgames, walking and a dog park which is always open, rain or shine.  My main complaint, though, is that the disc golfers have taken over almost the entire park so people who want to walk are at their mercy. Many of these guys also smoke, which makes it doubly bothersome. Otherwise, a pretty nice park.< /Review>

I grew up skating here. It's not the best skatepark in the world but it's fun to roll around for a few hours from time to time. The rest of the park is awesome, they do food trucks and other festivities here during the summer.< /review>

Really enjoy this park when the weather is below 80 degrees. But when the weather is hot so is this non shaded park. Also there are no water fountains or garbage cans near the parking lot next to the buildings. There are garbage cans about 50 ft away at the park. And there is a water fountain next to the dog park. Really need to update this park with a water fountain near the parking lot and buildings, garbage cans near the parking lot, & sails for the play structure.</review>

I grew up skating here. It's not the best skatepark in the world but it's fun to roll around for a few hours from time to time. The rest of the park is awesome, they do food trucks and other festivities here during the summer.< /Review>

A good 18 hole disc golf course. Relatively open, making it good for beginners, but it is a popular spot and can be busy at times.<//text>

Plenty to do. Tennis, skate park, street hockey, soccer field, disc golf, bbq, picnic tables, big dog leash free park, small dog leash free park, big kids playground, small kids playground, swings, bb, hiking/bike path around park. It could only be better if the trees grew money.</Text>

<Text>I love this park for the dog park, kids playground, but most of all for the DISC GOLF COURSE! There is a Final 9 located by the front lot. Skate park looks cool. There is also a basketball court and vending machines nearby. There are bathrooms by the dog park and hole 1 of the DGC, but there is no soap or seat covers. BYO sanitizer.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x809b1f69f0a71c93:0xed30079bf344deb8< /gmapID></record>

We practice T-Ball there and have games.  We'll go from time to tome for the kids park. They have everything, tennis courts, skate park, frisbee golf, dog park, baseball, a hockey rink, probably forgeting something else too.<//Text>
