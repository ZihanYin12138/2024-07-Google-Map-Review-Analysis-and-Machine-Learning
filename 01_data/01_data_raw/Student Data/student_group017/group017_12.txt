Advent Property Management has been managing a number of properties for me since 2012. And during all that time, they are very prompt, professional, cooperative, and have been providing excellent customer service.  Craig and Rhonda are always keeping me up to date with emails or phone calls relating to issues that arises from our rental units.  A note of special thank you for the outstanding work recently done on renovating one of our units that needed immediate attention before going back on the rental market.  Plus, a Tenant was screened and allowed to rent the same unit very quickly.  All I can say is, if you have a rental property and are looking for a management team to manage your property, look no further.  I highly recommend!</review>

Advent has been the best property management that I’ve rented from. I’ve dealt with primarily Craig and it was seamless from the time I contacted about my interest in the rental I ultimately moved into.

I’ve met the Advent team in their office in PB and impressed how professional, interpersonal, and helpful they were.

I don’t write reviews but if you are looking for a rental or even need a property listed, I highly recommend Advent Property Management.<//review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><review>I have been working with Advent Property Management for close to 5 years.  Advent manages our 10 unit apartment complex.  I can't say enough about their positive professional services the company provides.  Craig Everett sets high standards when it comes to communication and follow through.  He stays up to date on the rental market in the area and will provide opinions for managing the properties.   Craig keeps me current with future responsibilities, economical, maintenance and tenant issues.  The maintenance department responds in a timely matter for all issues received from the tenants.  The issues are handled professionally and resolved in a short time period.  Advent works for the best interest of the owners and is commended on their professionalism.
I would recommend Advent Property Management for anyone looking for a 1st rate Property Management Company.< /review><date>1555952549265<//date>< Response>

I would like to thank Sam West-Mensch for his hard work and great service.  I recently purchased a second property, and hired Advent as my property management rep.  From the start I received prompt responses, and was made aware prior to any changes.  After listing my property, it was posted for about a week and we found a tenant.  I'm more than satisfied with the service from Sam and the Advent Property Management team.  I would recommend them to anyone seeking an professional property management company that will take care of basically everything for you and cares about getting things right the first time.< /text>

<text>One of the worse experiences I have had to date.  I own several rental properties and I decided to work with Advent Property Management to have them manage my three-bedroom condo.  In the past, I was able to find a tenant within two weeks for this property; however, after two months of listing my property with Advent, they did not send me one referral so I requested they cancel my listing contact.  I was then able to find a tenant within five days myself.  Furthermore, they charged me for maintenance repairs on items I did not authorize or approve and when I asked about this, the owner of the company, Craig Everett, told me to pay or they would send me to collections. Advent is not just unprofessional, they are incompetent.  Do not use them to list your property for rent or property management -- find someone else.< /text><GmapID>0x80dc0192a7b77499:0x2e3f47aea21e7e44</GmapID><name>Danny P</name>< Pictures>

Advent Property Management has been managing a number of properties for me for more than six years. They are prompt, efficient, collaborative, knowledgeable, and provide excellent customer service. They are working in the best interest of the property and the owner; they genuinely care. After self-managing my properties for a few years, it is a relief to know and continue to experience that I’m in very competent hands. Their staff is professional, keeping me up-to-date with ongoing issues and is always quick to respond to emails in a friendly, positive, and efficient way.<//text>

<Review>I've used Craig and the folks at Advent for over 8-9 years now. I own a rental property in San Diego, while living in New Jersey and they make this process so easy! Anytime turns overs come up, they are pretty efficient and quick to turn over the rental. If any major renovations come up, or minor for that too - I can easily allow them to bring in vendors and almost hands off have everything taken care of. During renovations, I can also shop around for different prices and they are always willing to go any route you prefer. Some contractors are better or cheaper, etc. than others, however you have the option to handle as you wish -- which is so helpful from across the country. From a tenant standpoint - our tenants have always told us that they are happy with Craig and his team as well. I'd highly recommend.< /Review><time>1553778768384< /time>< gmapID>

<text>We've been with Craig and the Advent Team since 2009 and can only say great things about them. I've been away on an overseas tour and also currently on the east coast. They have easily dealt with difficult issues with minimal involvement from me. They are a true fire and forget property management team and I've had zero stress and lost very little sleep regarding my home in San Diego. The utmost highest recommendation from me!<//text><GmapID>0x80dc0192a7b77499:0x2e3f47aea21e7e44<//GmapID><Name>Eugene Nagy< /Name><UserId.>115260542656115867878< /UserId.>< pics>

<Review>Administratively, the company is very helpful. They are quick to respond to enquiries and usually send in good people to fix things. We had a plumbing issue that was resolved quickly and efficiently. The only drawback in the "handyman" that comes for normal service jobs. Our doorknob came off and it took him 3 separate attempts and different visits before it stayed on for more than a day. The front door was having a problem latching after that, so he came by and basically dug out the door and put in a metal piece for the latch to go in to that is now only held in by one screw, instead of the two that are meant to secure it. Another of our doors, on the side of the house, needed to be replaced. After spending all day doing it, we recently found out there is a large gap on the side closest to the frame. The only reason we found out was because it rained recently and we had to put down a towel inside the door to absorb all the water coming into the house. I know it doesn't rain in San Diego often, but some type of weather guard is going to be needed to ensure this doesn't happen again. Again, good company, poor choice of handyman.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Craig and his staff are always quick to respond when I have maintenance issues.  I had a water heater go out a few months ago and expressed my urgency to get this replaced when I submitted my maintenance request.  It was replaced by the time I got home from work the next day.  More recently I had a lower priority maintenance request and I was kept in the loop the entire time that it was being handled.  I've been very happy with the level of service that Craig and his team provide.</review>

<review>Advent Property Management has been managing our San Diego properties since 2008. We live out of the area, (near Pasadena, Ca), and so we needed someone local to take care of our rentals. It was just too far to take care of them ourselves. I do property management myself in my area and so I had the advantage of knowing what I wanted in a property management company. I spent a long time interviewing different companies because I didn't know anyone in the San Diego area, nor did I have any referrals for anyone there. I eventually chose Advent PM and have not been disappointed. There have been problems with tenants now and then, but that's typical. No matter how good a tenant looks on paper, issues can come up. What matters is how capable the management company is at solving those inevitable issues that arise up...be it tenant or repairs, etc. It's not just about collecting the money every month. Craig and his team have proven themselves more than capable time and time again. Rhonda in the repairs department is fantastic as well! Craig is a great problem solver overall! I'm so happy to have Advent taking care of our properties. I know I don't have to worry about it. His team there is easy to get a hold of. I've never had a problem reaching someone, even on the weekends. Their fees are very reasonable compared to other companies around. I've done surveys of what others companies charge, just to stay informed on the going market rates. When there is an upcoming vacancy, Craig is on it quickly, getting our vacant place ready and rented in a timely manner, so we don't have a big income gap. Based on my ten plus year experience with Advent, I can truly say that I highly recommend them to manage rental properties in the San Diego area. Linda Moca<//review>< Name>

Worse owner ever ! Craig told my fiancé that he did like his credit score ???? It over 700 also sent bank statements and Id !!! He was super rude and inconsiderate he could have emailed us if he needed more information! I was driving with my mother his phone kept cutting out and he told me to just listen ! Not friendly , false remarks on credit and unprofessional tone .
May karma take action, so blessed to find out what type of management company we could have gotten ! Look at the reviews !!!!  Karma karma karma so glad my best friend works for the housing commission! Breaking the law is a crime !</text>

<response>{'time': 1565366537255, 'text': 'WARNING - Beware of this individual and her boyfriend. This reviewer, named Cecilia Ozturk of "Cecilia\'s Maid Service" applied to rent one of our properties in the name of another individual who had never even viewed the property. I sensed something wrong from the first time I met her. She\'s a fast talker and said some questionable things that didn\'t line up with what was on her boyfriends application. First of all, it was weird that she was applying for a rental in her boyfriends name and then promising me she wasn\'t going to be living with him (red flag #1). Then there were several questionable things on the application that just didn\'t line up with what she was saying. When I asked her a few questions about the application, which is what a property manager does, she got extremely defensive and very argumentative (red flag #2). Due to fair credit reporting restrictions I can not disclose the credit score of the individual she used to apply for the property and certainly not his name but let\'s just say it didn\'t qualify for our minimum credit requirements. (red flag #3) Needless to say I informed Cecilia\'s boyfriend that I would not be renting the property to him the next thing I know low and behold we start getting these bad reviews. Bottom line beware of this person and certainly do your homework before you decide to rent to her. Very sketchy!'}<//response><gmap_id>0x80dc0192a7b77499:0x2e3f47aea21e7e44< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I've been using Advent to manage my rental property for years. We're very happy with the superior level of customer service and the attention to detail. They're always very responsive by phone and don't send me to voicemail. If you're looking for personalized service this is definitely the place to go. Talk to Craig, the Broker, who's my property manager. He's given us an entirely whole new level of service. Thanks Advent Team.< /text>

I've never had a problem with a landlord allowing me to find a replacement tenant. Craig is too lazy to go through the process for a couple hours, and doesn't care that it'll be impacting my life for 7 months. Stay away.

Craig’s company was fired by the landlord due to trying to overcharge both the landlord and the tenants upon move out. The silliest charge was going to be $180 for tightening two screws on a faceplate. Unreal.</Text>< username>

I advise to stay the heck away from this company if you're a tenant or an owner. They try to nickel and dime, the contractors they hire do shotty work! AVOID AT ALL COSTS. If you would like evidence I am happy to provide it. Craig is the worst :( I am a good tenant and I always paid my bills, I don't want other people to have to deal with this terrible property management company!</Review>< resp>

You submitted your application on 07/06/16 and when we spoke the next day (7/07/16), I informed you that we received your application and would begin screening you.

I'm sure you're aware that we're in a very competitive rental market and that it is incumbent upon the people applying to submit their materials as quickly as possible.  And yes, sometimes two days makes a world of difference.  By the time your husband applied, a tenant had already been selected.  For this reason, we gladly refunded your husbands application fee.  We are unable to refund your application fee because we had already processed your credit application.

Wow, what a horrible experience I had with this company and I'm really the last person to complain about things like this.  Filled out a rental application one night, called and left a message on their machine that same night.  Didn't hear back from them the next day, so when I called the next day to follow up, Craig was so unhelpful that he failed to tell me that my husband would need to fill out an application to even look at the place even though I asked for what I would need to do to proceed.  He told me they'd need to process my application and then call to schedule an appointment the following week.  Then at 3:30 pm the following day, he emailed me to say my husband needed to submit an application that day. He never called to let me know it was urgent. Needless to say He rented out the condo and would not issue a refund for my application, just my husbands even though I was mislead.  I would suggest looking elsewhere if you're wanting to rent.

The manager told me it would be $895 to take it apart to find the problem and the cost would be $3500 - $5000,  so I asked about a used replacement instead of a rebuild, the manager said he would get back to me but never did. Every day I would call, he would say he would call me back. All communication was initiated by me, the shop never called nor gave me a price on a used transmission.

We took our car here for a free inspection. Upon talking to Michael, we felt their technicians are very professional, so we decided to trust them with our car. We couldn't be happier with our decision. The car now runs perfect,  the cost is reasonable, and they offer warranty for their work! We can now have peace of mind. This is one of our best experiences in regards to mechanics.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Of course transmissions are never easy to work on, but I got my truck back in about a little over a week. The price was fair and the service was great.

Took my car to the VW dealership and they wanted 8k+ to replace my transmission & clutch I called AAMCO just to get a phone estimate, they told me to bring it in for a free inspection to see if both parts needed to be replaced, after a day they found out that only the clutch needed replacing and only 2k to do the job. They fix it an no problem since will be taking my car here for any problems before I take it to the VW dealership. Very friendly staff as well.</text>

I don't think I have ever written a review but had to make an exception.   It's hard to find a  honest mechanic now adays. I found one in AAMCO. I took my car to another mechanic and they wanted to charge me $1400 I decided to stop AAMCO and after looking at my car they said it was just a blown fuse.  NO CHARGE! They just earned a customer for life. Mike the manger very professional.  THANK AAMCO!< /text>

I've always been skeptical of car shops and rightly so as I've had bad experiences with them in the past, however right from the get go, AAMCO was different. I walked because I needed my transmission checked out and was told it was completely free, but skeptical as always, I must have asked the owner about 20 times if it was truly free, you think he would have gotten annoyed but instead he reassured me each time and lo and behold everything was free. The service was without a doubt the most honest I've seen from any shop and very friendly and I got my car back the same day, turns out it was fine, and they didn't try to rip me off and try to sell me another transmission like another shop would have. I'm grateful.<//review>

Thank you very much Michael Huang and Team of AAMCO CHINO. I just migrated from the Philippines and bought an old car ( 2000 model ) . I was looking for a car shop who I could trust. A well known tire and lube shop referred me to AAMCO CHINO. They repaired my transmission and after the 10 day post repair check they called me again after a month to check on how the car was doing.
Thank you very much for your Honesty , for being trustworthy and for you expertise.
Customer service is great. Ill being going back for my car maintenance needs.
From an Appreciative customer.</Review>

<Text>These is the first time I came to the AAMCO for my 2007 suburban truck. My transmission stop working. They were able to offer free towing which saved us money. In the end it did cost 3,000. The guy that helped us out was Micheals very friendly. Helped explain everything on the truck. They even had a 10 day period were we come back and make sure everything was ok. Loved the service would recommend and come back. Left happy.< /Text><Date>1565998220731<//Date><Response>None<//Response>< pics>

My first time going to this location. I had my front brakes and rotors replaced this morning while I waited. Also got an oil change at the same time. It took a few hours, which included having to get the parts from the dealer. Richard, the service manager was great. Very friendly and knowledgeable and the final cost was less than he quoted. I’ll definitely take my business there again. Thanks Richard.< /text>

I'd like to give special thank you to Michael the manager of this aamco location. The main reason I chose to do business here was because of his genuine sense of being and wanting to help you get your vehicle in proper running order at the best rate. I was in a really tight bind money wise at the time and he truly helped me out in many ways by finding the best price he can get me and set me up with a payment plan that helped me avoid interest and truly saved me from a bad situation had I gone anywhere else even another aamco. Michael treats you like family and is the difference between a great business you want to return and send others who need vehicle service. Thank you again, continue the good honest work over there it's hard to come by.<//text>

Beware of their warranty coverage. I had my 04 Envoy transmission rebuilt early December of 2015 at the AAMCO location in Chino, CA. This came with a 2 year or 24000 mile warranty. I was happy with the repair until 3/12/17 when the transmission started to act up. I brought the vehicle in the next morning expecting things to be taken care of under the warranty. Rob Paredes (Store Manager) calls me and says there is something going in there and the transmission has to be removed for further inspection. Due to me being 49 miles over the warranty I would be charged to remove the transmission, with assurance they would work with me on parts. He would not budge on this, just saying he understands.  I can’t believe that they would charge me with the failure occurring literally the day after the warranty runs out. What kind of company does that?  I am basically expected to pay for another transmission rebuild that will only last a day past the warranty. This is terrible customer service and there is no way I would spend another dime there or recommend their service to anyone. Maybe one customer does not matter to them, but had they simply honored the warranty I would have remained happy with the knowledge they take care of their customers.  I urge anyone reading this to look elsewhere for a company that will take care of their customers.<//review>

Ron..the master technician here is one of the most professional and honest mechanics I have ever dealt with. I work in the automotive industry at several big car dealerships and I have found that this location with their complementary engine light reading diagnostic is so honest and very upright.<//review>

<review>Great customer service. I needed a new transmission for awhile on my Chevy suv. I tried this place because of the reviews. My truck runs great and it didn't cost as much as I was quoted from a few other places. I recommend this shop for sure. The lady at the counter helped me get some financing which helped a lot.<//review>< pictures>

We contacted a few shops and she said she was impresses with the manager at the Chino Aamco.  He said he could tow it in and inspect it for free.   After inspection we found out that the transmission was not broke but the axle had popped out of the the transmission and a new one would take care of the issue.   We went from 1 shop quoting us $2500.00 to only spending $750.00 and that included some brake work.  These guys ae the best.</text>< Pics>

<Text>This is going to be my new repair shop!..... I brought my care in thinking it had a bad transmission. Expecting the worse, Aamco called me back, telling me I had a bad catalytic converter.
I called the dealer to get the price of the part, since I am a shopper, Chat at Aamco charged me exactly what the dealer quoted for the part.
They were so polite and helpful at explaining the technical terminology to me....I feel I can trust them for all my repairs in the future.< /Text>< pics>

Our transmission went out in our Pacific Crystler.  I took it to our regular shop where they were only going to give me a 6 month or 6,000 mile warranty.  Aamco in Chino doubled the warranty.  The repair was done quickly.  When it made a little noise after the repair, Chad was eager to take a look and fine tune the programming to eliminate the problem.

I have since then brought the car back for brakes, and other non transmission repairs.  I feel confident that Chad's repairs are carefully evaluated (avoiding unnessesary repair $$$) and that confident that he will stand by his work.   An honest and very service oriented shop!</text>

< Review>
This aamco is under new management and new ownership and is worse than it was before. I have lived in chino for 31 years and my experience was horrible, I should have gone with my gut, stay away go to other local actual transmission shops,  and if you still are considering using them google aamco take a look at how many lawsuits and horrible cases they have against them unfortunately I got hooked by the radio commercials and big name brand and had to find out the hard way please read this than stay away.
I had my transmission rebuilt june of last year for 1900 dollars at a discounted rate due to a referral fee still over priced, with a 1 year warranty, I was told I could not receive an extended warranty  due to my vehicle being 4 wheel drive, but was offered an 18 month warranty after the transmission went out the third time at exactly a year, for an additional 1500 dollars because I was 3000 miles over the 12 month 12000 mile warranty, even though the transmission had gone out within the warranty period  5 months after the first time it was rebuilt, the manager at that time Mike was very helpful  and professional and restored what little faith in this nationwide brand that I had thinking ok this time it was rebuilt right, but no it goes out the third time at exactly a year and of course mike is no longer with them and new management and new ownership. Now  they are claiming negligence on my part and giving me a new diagnostic as of why, which should have been found the first, or second time, and a written diagnostic should have been giving those times just like it was this time, but no now they want me to pay an additional 15000 with an 18 month warranty which wasn't offered the first or second time, or 1000 with no warranty I asked for a 1000 with a 12 month warranty seems how the thing went out three times in a year and they said no, which tells me they have no clue what they're doing because people go to aamco for the warranty and supposed transmission expertise,  or I was offered for them to put in a used transmission, what kind of transmission specialist offers a used transmission that hasn't been rebuilt, and or won't budge or help to make things right on a transmission that went out 3 times within a year with barely 3000 miles over, ones that don't believe in their craft, ones that don't take pride in their work, and ones that don't care about there customers or their customer's vehicles, ones that won't do whatever it takes to fix something they should have fixed multiple times, and make it right, just ones that care about the all mighty dollar burn em and turn em. I contacted corporate no help also please please save yourself some money and headaches and wondering if maybe they did their job the right way the first time, don't go with this big name brand because that's all they are. Do your Homework first wish i would have and i normally do.</Review>

I call yesterday ti ask them if the could do a diagnoise on my 1991 chrysler , he said ya but it would take a few hours but he could definitely give me an answer today , so i dropped it off at 11am , didnt hear from them so at 4 i called, he said he didnt have an answer yet but he would have a diagnoise soon... So i verfied that they closed at 5 and that he would call ke before then. He said yes. At 455 i called him. He said he was just calling me. And that they could diagnoise my car today because the need to get a diagnoistic machine for cars before 1996. Which i discovered that there are 2 different types of machines. But why dont they have both. And why did it take him 6 hours to figure it out. Well i dont care what diagnoises they give me now. I wont be letting this idiot anywhere near my car after that bs.</text>

Worst customer service. Car sat for 5 hours till they looked at it. Then when we got it back it did start now, but now it also sounded awful. Never going back to this AAMCO again. To bad I can not give less than 1 star, cause they suck.< /review>

I decided to try this place on a whim and found it to be good, but no where near the best. The table service here is a welcome touch. Please note that you pay after you have eaten, and they only accept cash. There is an ATM on location, but frankly I would be VERY weary of using it - expensive fees or worse may be waiting in store. The sauce on my cheese enchiladas was excellent, it had a great depth of flavor that was slightly spicy but not overpowering. I thought the amount of cheese was just right, although the overall size of the enchiladas is not too big. The rice on the other hand was a bit of a letdown. There was nothing off-putting about it, but it just tasted sort of bland. The beans were a bit better, but still had my yearning for more flavor. As with all of these small Mexican restaurants the mini salad they add is a nice touch but absolutely nothing to write home about, I noted several large pieces of lettuce that were from the base of the lettuce (that white, hard bit) which were totally inedible. The drink selection here features many glass bottles varieties of Mexican favorites, such as Coca-Cola and Jarritos. Overall it was nothing special, but was good enough to satisfy a hungry individual. I might be inclined at a later date to give El Ruby one more chance to impress me. Also, the menu on the wall is in Spanish, but has pictures to help you decide what you want if Spanish is not your forte.</review>

There was an excessive amount of sauce but it had good flavor and a nice kick.  The owners really need to give the place a heavy cleaning though.<//Text>< Pictures>

I've been wanting to try this place for years. I got a mild flu and knew the only thing that was going to make me feel better was good enchiladas with red sauce and some chicken soup. My son went and got it for me. Wow! The chicken soup is homemade and absolutely delicious! The enchiladas were exactly what I wanted, and the rice and beans were very good, too. There was a LOT of food, easily enough for two people. My son really liked the soup, too. This is a place we will definitely be going back to.</text>

<review>The food is authentic. It's infused with great flavor that will have you wondering why you haven't gone before. The service is amazing. They're really nice people and you can see that they're dedicated to giving good service. This restaurant has definitely became one of my top 10.</review><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Went here with a friend and ordered a torta. It was small with little meat. My buddy got a burrito and that thing was massive. It looked great. We decided to visit a second time and it was a disappointment. There was only one person working the orders. I was put on hold for a phone call...took several minutes. Only having half hour for lunch, we decided to leave to a nearby place. They are ok, but we won't be going back for a while.</text>

Orderd the molcajete mixto through Doordash. First time I tried this place. OMG!!!  My tastebuds are dancing with culinary delight!!!  The shrimp is amazingly delicious, the chorizo is just as I remember growing up in my pueblito, the carne asada and chicken are off the chart tasty.

I have lived in LA for decades, always looking for authentic places that reflect el sabor, el olir, y el color de mi Mexico lindo y querido. In that time I have found a very short list of dining locations, as my standards are pretty high. Today I am adding this place to the too of my list😎.

Felicidades a la familia and know I will be back again and again going forward. In these tough times it is critically important that we ensure family owned restaurants in our barrio make it through beyond the covid era. God bless you and know I will do my part to spread the word about your culinary excellence 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽< /Text>

<Review>Looking for typical Mexican food, I came across this place online. The reviews were good so I decided to give it a try.. I m pleased to share that my experience was good! The service is great and so is the food. My boyfriend got the chicken mole enchiladas which were delicious and I got the green chilaquiles with eggs. Bomb!! I highly recommend.<//Review>< pics>

Been going there for years. Now I'm NOT going there anymore. Complaint about being over charge. I have previous receipts. Most I've paid for breakfast for two is $22.04 service has been ok . constantly have to ask for coffee. They do not give you a bill. You pay at the register. Not they are charging $5.00 more!!! Seriously!!! Girl says machine don't lie. A plate cost $7.98 ea for 2 it's $15.96 ...2 coffees @ $2.49 ea. Is $4.98 total is $20.04 + tax should not be $6.17. Pd $26.21 .
Over charged.... I complaint and the manger she said to me that I caused a too much problem. I asked for a receipt.... She gave me a different receipt. Never again will I ever go there again. Menu says one price their machine says another. I guess they need the $$$ more than me. My family is no longer gonna go there again. They just lost our business. If you go there be careful of them over charging.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) The salda del molcajete tastes strange, and the campechana are pieces of surimi with shrimp, it does not have oysters or clams since they are part of this cocktail, only minced minced octopus

(Original)

The food is not very good and the sauce for the chips is very bad and tasteless.
For my point of view, Blvd Café and Little Mexico are much better ...

PS dicen q con hambre cualquier cosa es buena.
No está muy bien la comida  y la salsa para los chips está muy mal y desabrida.
Para mi punto de vista está mucho mejor El Blvd Café y el Little México...</Review>< pictures>

Just a little gritty, just enough to make you feel comfortable, and not too much that it's icky. I wish I lived closer, or I would be coming here first choice every time I went out for a drink. Also, one of the few dive bars that has a decent sized martini glass. And, yes, they fill 'er up!< /Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<Text>I ordered smoked salmon egg Benedict and kimchi rice. Don't order the kimchi rice. The cheesecake is so delicious, the sweet toasty crust is almost like it was meant to be a creme brulee flavored cheesecake. All bombolinis are good choices. Fluffy and not too sweet. Hazelnut croissant, not something I could order again. Overall, food and ambience are worth the travel.<//Text><name>Ana Baldwin<//name><Rate>4</Rate><resp>None< /resp></record>

Rating a 5 as a dive bar.  Great prices on drinks especially in Los Angeles.  The bartenders are great and friendly.  Clientele is extremely varied.  They have a shuffleboard table and often have folks randomly bring in snacks as a local thing (had cupcakes one time, cookies another).  They do have an old school hotdog rotisserie until it runs out.</Text>

If you're ever looking for a cool spot in the South Bay/Redondo area to have a drink, watch the game, play some pool or darts, meet up with friends, celebrate a birthday, or sing karaoke (yes they have karaoke. Every Wednesday. It's one helluva time and such a fun show) then you MUST come to The World Famous THIRSTY CLUB!<//Review>< resp>

Me any girlfriend are on vacation and drove from Texas to California! We were looking for a place to grab a late drink and came across this bar. Its very small but it has a great atmosphere. Our Bartender Nicole was awesome. Very nice and down to earth. We mentioned it was our first time here and she bought our first two drinks. I will definitly suggest going of your in the area. I CANT WAIT TO COME BACK TO CALI!!<//review>

Thirsty club was giving an good recommondation. So today was our first visit there..but was a really disappointed visit. I tried to order drinks for about 15 minutes..standing at the bar...waving..but.the girl behind the bar was giving no attention. Ignored me.....i think it is a bar for "we know each other"..we are a couple from Amsterdam..and like meet people from elsewhere.. but for us..the thirsty club is not the bar we were hoping for it was..</review>< time>

This place is awesome and has one of my all time most memorable and favorite bartendress' but also sometimes cheaper than drinking at home,  and if i lived closer to it, be there every day. Note: if theres a woman who looks like Ally Sheedy from the breakfast club ate Molly Ringwald and went raging alcoholic after getting a job nextdoor at the flower shop, then you have met in person the girl referenced in every mens room preceded by "For a good time call-"  the password is: Norway< /Text>

<Review>I’ve never had highlights before and I’m so glad I chose Salon de Beaute! Allan was a master at highlights and the colors blend so beautifully. The salon is lovely and Allan was so kind and friendly. He was very accommodating with my appointment time. He really makes himself available for his clients. Had a great experience and highly recommend!< /Review><Rate>5< /Rate></record>

Allan was wonderful. Great people skills. Made me feel comfortable. He went out of his way to extend his work schedule to give me an appointment as soon as possible. Loved the Brazilian blowout. Will definitely be back! The salon is clean and beautiful. Highly recommend</Text>

Highly recommend this place he is very honest and gives the best advice when deciding what to do with your hair. He respects your time and doesn’t over book and has only one customer at a time. Went in for a haircut and highlights and I wouldn’t go anywhere else after seeing what he has done. Make sure to book your appointment and check this place out!< /text>

I had a Brazilian blowout and haircut done with Alan.
He did an excellent job.
He provided timely service and was very professional.
He has very strong customer service and interpersonal skills.  It is evident he loves what he does.
I plan to go back to him for the Brazilian  blowout, but I am also going to come back for hair color and highlights.
Highly recommend!!!!!</Text>

My favorite place!! I haven't went anywhere else after discovering this amazing hair salon. I am very picky and don't trust many hair salons yet this place won my trust and loyalty. I always feel happy with the beautiful work Alan puts into my hair.< /text>

I felt comfortable there and had no worries about how my hair would turn out.   I have recommended his salon to all my friends and people I meet.  Everyone including my wife loves what he did for my looks.  I will be a life long customer .  Robert</review><user>107871026155632809479<//user>< Date>

I love this salon! Besides being aesthetically beautiful to the eye and very modern, the services that are offered are extraordinary and the owner, Alan, is an expert at what he does. From the moment I walked in, he made me feel like royalty, pampering me and showering me with amazing treats and drinks and then came the amazing hairstyling! He has done highlighting, a Brazilian blowout, hair extensions, blow dry with style, and trim so far and my hair is just gorgeous! His prices are very reasonable as well. I go to him on a weekly basis and after finding him, I'm never going back to anybody else! You have to give this place a try! You won't be disappointed!< /review>

<rating>5<//rating><text>What a wonderful experience!!!  I went into the Salon De Beaute in Monrovia for a hair cut.  What I received was a relaxing experience with a nice cold glass of water (other beverages were offered), I enjoyed a delightful conversation with Alan, and was given a beautifully sculpted hair design.

My usual hair cut is very good, but being who I am I usually re-style it --- NOT with Alan as your stylist.  It was beautiful.  I had several errands to run after the appointment and several stranger approached me to tell me that I had a WONDERFUL haircut/style.  They asked me where I had it done and I told them Salon De Beaute in Monrovia.

I live in Washington state, but have family in Monrovia ---- so I am thinking that I'll be able to schedule appointments when I come down for visits.

Thank you Alan --- I loved the experience and the style!!</text>< Pictures>

<text>I’ve gone to Allen for 20+ years for my hair, he straightens thick, curly hair with such ease it feels like silk! No one blow dries and cuts hair like Allen, it’s so soft I wish I didn’t have to wash it!

I’ve seen his work with extensions, blowouts color, cuts and various styles on all ages and hair types. He also does weddings and other special events. He is top notch! And he doesn’t charge premium price! He realizes the importance of keeping his clients happy and coming back to him.

I haven’t had one set hair stylist until I came to Alan. I have been coming to him for the past 6 months and he’s absolutely amazing and does it all. His service is incredible as he treats his customers like royalty, has the best pricing and his final products are always the best. His new location is so clean, professional and decor is stunning. I plan on staying here for my hair needs forever!< /Text>

I used salon de beaute for my wedding. The owner, Allan allowed my bridal party and I to all get ready at the salon. We got there at 5am and he welcomed us with coffee. The place is pretty and tasteful, so safe to say that it looks beautiful in pictures (such a big deal for me bc I wanted getting ready pix) The hair and the make up both turned out FLAWLESS. I felt like a princess and my bridesmaids all looked gorgeous as well. We all had different hair and hair styles. I can’t recommend enough. I wish there was something more than 5 stars.<//Review>

<Review>Absolutely Amazing service. Window was broken out one day and replaced the next. He made it so convenient by coming to me. And his prices are very reasonable.
Fast and reliable service.... I am so satisfied and happy! Will definitely refer and use in future for any of my window needs!</Review><user>107534363070788948603< /user>< user_name>

Igor was awesome and accommodating. I called on Wednesday and he was there on Friday morning. 45 mins early!  He was very professional and responded to my calls immediately. He was on time and ready to work.

His price was definitely affordable. I would DEFINITELY call Igor and use his service. I highly recommend Igor and his business if you need window replacement. Definitely a 5 stars service/business!!!<//Review>

His price was definitely affordable. He was fast and kept my door panel clean. He vacuumed and cleared all the broken glasses inside my door.

In the future, I hope I would never have to call for his help (because I don't want anyone breaking into my car). However, if I do, I would DEFINITELY call Igor and use his service.

Miracle worker.. He was even here earlier than my appointed time. My car was broken into not only was he here at my house the same day it happened he also vacuumed my car, and everything was done in a jiffy.. He was the only one that quoted me a great price and he answered me back quickly.. Amazing service.< /text>

<Review>Wow, I am above and BEYOND happy with Igor and his small business! Not only was he punctual, professional, and kind, but his work is immaculate! I was stressed over needing to pay a high price for a windshield that my insurance would not cover, not only that, but I didn't want to have to leave my car a full day (like other places) while I was at work.

Igor was more than accommodating with my schedule. He got me scheduled asap and beat part is that his service is mobile so he came to me and got the job done in less than 30 minutes! I also had a  MORE THAN FAIR total labor and parts included.

Needless to say, I think all Sacramento car owners should go to him! I will forever refer to him and support him with the 5 stars he deserves!!!👍⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 😁<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>MIT auto glass was great. Igor was able to replace my passenger side window in under an hour all while I was at work. Called him this morning and  before noon I had a new window. Pricing was half of some other auto glass replacement companies in the area. I would highly recommend him and this company.

Amazing service, 10/10. Called and scheduled and appointment last minute due to my broken windshield, Igot is super easy to work with and professional while still maintaining top notch quality service for an affordable price. Even though I was at work he still came out to me and waited until I was able to take my break in order to get the new windshield set up. Highly recommend to everyone, no one else can compare to MIT Auto Glass!< /text>

Igor was very responsive.  Over the phone he quoted me for the windshield and scheduled a 12 - 1pm window for installation the next day.  Showed up at 12 on the dime.  Installation was smooth and easy.  Very professional.  Price was exactly what he quoted me.  Cant ask for anything better than that.  Highly recommend this guy.<//text>

We are new here but so far this place is great! The Doctor and her staff that I have been in contact with so far are very nice and helpful and answered my questions. They gladly gave me a detailed quote for my cats surgery and pointed out the things that were not medically necessary but nice to have ( like certain blood work and pain medications). I'm looking forward to doing more business with them. 🐱< /review>

I took my cat there 04/05 for a check up and estimate for dental cleaning. They were prompt, professional,  courteous,  and everything was clearly explained.  Because my cat will be having a dental cleaning under anesthesia,  she needed bloodwork in advance. They did the bloodwork at this visit. Her doctor,  Doctor Renfro, called with the results a few days later, at 8pm! I couldn't believe she was still working that late!! We really like our new doctor and vet practice and look forward to a long relationship.</review>

<Review>Seems sketchy. Still not allowed in to meet a Dr even when scheduling surgery as a new patient. Feels like vets are hiding behind Covid protocol because it is probably easier than dealing with dog owners. Not clean. Not organized. Had some questions regarding my dogs pre surgery process and vets wouldn't bother calling me to discuss.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80dd26fbb985dab1:0x1a1e39e0d9086663< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<time>1609962640458</time><rating>5</rating><Text>***Experience during Covid-19 pandemic: my boy pups has a lot of health issues. He needs daily allergy injections and we come here several times a year and even during the pandemic it has been a great experience. Due to the pandemic we are no longer allowed inside but we park and call the office. The nice vet technician will come out and pick up your pup and take them inside. Dr. Pluskat does an examination and give you a call and thoroughly explains issues and addresses all concerns we may have. Dr. Pluskat is the absolute best!!

WARNER AVE ANIMAL HOSPITAL is my FIRST choice for all vet visits & I highly recommend them. Appointment do book up fast, so a few days to week is needed to be seen. I go to my second choice when in a hurry such as a quick shots or urgent matters but this place is worth the wait for annual visits and procedures. (Depending on the situation they may be able to squeeze you in!! Before the pandemic, they fit me in for an emergency).

The staff is really nice when booking appointments, going over the charges, and picking up/dropping off the pups to the car. We love Warner Ave Animal Hospital!!<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>Not good. Very young vet, doing euthanasia on my 8yr old GSD. Her injections were a couple cc's of air on sedation and dog went into convulsions. She ran out while I held my dog to get more dosage. Not sure that they weighed her. I had to calm the vet down in the room we were in.  No assistance.</Review>< date>

I had to edit my review. The staff and Dr’s at Warner Ave Animal Hospital took excellent care of my “Belle” during her emergency surgery. I can’t thank them enough. They helped me find grants to help pay for my baby’s services. I’m so thankful for them. Wonderful staff!!!</Review>

I had to give 4 stars, because we called when we arrived, but they forgot about us, and after waiting almost 30 min I had to call them to remind them that we were waiting; someone came out promptly after that.</Review>< Pictures>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Great service, friendly knowledgeable staff and vets. Their list of services is complete, everything from Avian to Wellness programs.
Warner Avenue Animal Hospital also works with Exotic animal like snake, herbal, ferrets and even iguanas.
Appointments are recommended and they keep on schedule. We've never waited longer than :15-20 minutes.
Their pricing is competitive.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjE6S9hGtiMyndLPfXxmVt2mMoRh_rSkpK8fQ-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvqcHFSW3tzMT6rA0pVOkZvQLMc76sKb5TWOyy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< resp>

<Review>I’m continually impressed with the vets here and their knowledge and attention to detail. I feel like they really take the time to understand the issue and so they’ve been able to fix everything we’ve come in for (and a few additional things we didn’t even realize could be fixed!) I was originally referred here by our regular vet for an after hours issue, but now I come here for everything.</Review>< pictures>

I'm very impressed with this vet. I hadn't taken my dog to a vet in three years due to bad experiences I've had. The staff and doctors at Warner Avenue Animal Hospital have restored my faith. I know I have found my new vet. They are further from my home than I prefer, but they are definitely worth the drive.<//Text>

I work in Rescue and we need to stretch our $$ to provide the best vet care possible to our dogs. The owner of Warner Ave was gracious to extend to us a rescue discount which the manager Guy initiated. Thank you Guy!!
We were able to have a senior dog in desperate need of a dental taken care of by Dr. Pluskat. Dr. P is very enthusiastic. She called me soon after the dental to let me know how George was doing and how many teeth she had to remove. He also had a tumor which needed to be biopsied, she walked me through the entire procedure and gave me her opinion of the determination of the tumor. She was correct, it was benign. This was my first dog that had had to have so many teeth removed. I was given excellent instructions (written & verbal) on his after care, along with medication to make him more comfortable.
Staff has always been extremely pleasant and courteous. This clinic might not be brand new but their care in my experience has been top notch. Incidentally, another Rescue recommended the clinic to me saying their experience had been good also.<//text>

< Review>
I switched Vets after 25 years they were insisting I needed full panels, and insisting on additional procedures my pets did not need, i.e. full blood panel for a 6 year old cat who came in with allergies she's had since I got her is not necessary, etc., so I tried Warner Avenue.  Suzanne is amazing, she gave me a warm and fuzzy feeling the first visit, amazing energy.  She was silly and loving, petting my baby and had 3 silly nicknames for my chubby kitty.  I was sold!!  This is the vet for my fur baby.  Sadly she left for an incredible opportunity on an island near Hawaii. She was replaced by Dr. Delancey, I believe is her name, who is also very calming and kind with great energy. She had been doing fill ins for quite some time floating to different vets and finally took the position when Suzanne left last month. Dr D is the perfect replacent!!  Their pricing is fair, way cheaper than my previous vet who I felt took advantage of owners in a crisis with a sick pet. Warner Avenue is not like them nor do they ever insist on extra things not needed.  I've been going there for over a year now, and I'm very happy there.< /Review>

<text>I think this office is just wonderful. The hours are very accommodating for those of us who have really busy lives. With kids, work and a new puppy I don’t have a lot of extra time to take off of work to take my dog to the vet.  I am so grateful that they are open until midnight most nights. The doctor was so informative and gave me way more information than my previous vet ever gave me about my new pup. She really took the time to answer my questions and made me feel like she really cared about my lil pup. It was super easy to get an appointment and the staff was so warm and caring. I would highly recommend this office for sure.<//text><gmap_id>0x80dd26fbb985dab1:0x1a1e39e0d9086663</gmap_id><Rating>5< /Rating></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Pluskat Is THE BEST!! Her bedside demeanor is so calming, she makes you feel like she loves and cares for your animal. She explains everything she sees, gives treatment recommendations and tells you how she would treat your pet as if it were her pet. The vet techs are awesome as well; they come in and discuss the vets recommendation and the price for care and work with you to come to an informed decision on care. I can’t say enough how knowledgeable and caring this place is, plus they accommodate people who work before 9 and after 6. BRING YOUR BABIES HERE!< /review>

< review>
I would not recommend that anybody bring their animal to this animal clinic.
We brought in our 3 year old kitten for an appointment recently at 9 PM because he was having trouble urinating and was meowing in discomfort.
First impressions were the office was tiny, dirty, and had an odor that did not speak "hospital" to me; the staff seemed disinterested.
Dr. Pluskat was rough-handed on getting our scared kitty out of his carrier and feeling around for his bladder. After a 1 minute evaluation, they gave us a quote for a 1-3 night hospital stay with catheter to drain his bladder and IV for $1500-$2000. We felt we had no choice as no other options were given for home treatment so we agreed and let them take him back.
At around 11:45 PM we received an update call that our kitty was asleep and draining and all sounded okay.
The next morning at 8 AM, we received a phone call from Dr. Black saying that our cat had died overnight.
The explanation we received was that his kidneys possibly failed causing his heart to stop, but we were distraught at the news.
We had no idea he was in a life-threatening situation, or we would have taken him to a 24 hour clinic.
I would not recommend having your animals evaluated here, especially overnight or if you think it's an emergency.
We left hurt and angry not knowing or getting a straight answer if our kitty was actually that sick (he was bright and vibrant leading up to this day), or wondering if the Doctors had accidentally overdosed him on drugs or sedatives and left him in an unstable condition overnight alone with no supervision.
Please consider our story if you're wondering whether to bring your loved ones here, as our joy was taken from our lives under the hands of a very callous staff, with hardly a meaningful "sorry your cat died", and a $1000 bill with three papers all being left of our kitty.<//review>

< Review>
Was referred here since moving to this side of town and SO GLAD I was! I used to take my rescue kitty to AAA Animal Hospital because I heard it was affordable (despite some scary Yelp reviews), but Warner Avenue Animal Hospital beat their prices for vet visit, the same exact flea medicine which I can order online and have shipped to my home rather than having to go in and pick up every month, and dental procedure (which I found out wasn't even needed as AAA had requested)! Their extended hours are a huge plus, but all staff from check in, to nurse, to Vet were all friendly, very informative and patient with my questions. Dr. Pluskat was very personable and I will not be taking my pets anywhere else!</Review>

loved Dr. Pluskat's knowledge with my rabbit! Also like that they are open at night because the only vets open at night are the pricey emergency ones. Service was excellent. Out of my way to get here, but would come only here for my rabbits b/c I finally found a good vet for my bun buns</text>

Everyone I have encountered here have been amazing. I've had to unfortunately visit 4-5 times in the last month and a half with my cat, who I just had to put down. The understanding they have, has made a difficult decision a little easier. I highly recommend Dr. Pluskat.< /text>

Dr P is spectacular and really makes us feel like our doggo matters.  He gets loved there and he isn't scared at all walking in door which is great considering the procedures he's had to undergo recently.  Keep it up team- everyone is awesome. And kuddos to the front desk for always double checking my invoice and confirming treatments before billing me.  Every penny counts when you have a sick animal.  Much appreciated.<//Text>< gmap_id>

The office staff seems really busy and the wait on the phone is too long.  Sometimes they speak too fast and are sometimes very loud in the office.  However the vet Dr Pluskat is very attentive, listens, and is very loving with the animals.... I don't know about the other vets but I am a newcomer and will return again. Thank you for your kindness!!</review>

<review>Want to know why we chose Warner Ave Animal Hospital in the first place?  Because it was the closest!  Hahaha!  But we have been very happy with them and the services they have provided to our pets, even though they had to put down two of them.  The staff was very caring and compassionate as well as professional.  We even got a card.  The building is an older one, but don't let that stop you from using their services.  Fancy settings do not guarantee good pet care.  Good people do.< /review>< pics>

It was Sunday. I Was a hysterical mess.thinking he was dying. Knowing my Vet was closed. Called their office expecting to get a an answer service.
Dr Black answered the phone and told me that  Warner Avenue Animal Hospital was Beach City animal
Sister Hospital. Did not know this.
I explain my dogs problem. She said to bring him right in. Sunday Morning 10:30a.m.
The staff was so great. They took us right into a room.
Dr Black gave him a thorough exam. But knew right away what was wrong. He had a Dog Disease that old dogs get. Like Vertigo.
I can not Thank this Veternetarian enough. She is now my new Vet.
I highly recommended warner Avenue Animal Hospital.

<Review>Dr black is amazing, plus the staff is kind and caring, I love them all. I've had such positive experiences with them from the most difficult situation - the loss of our 12 year old Lab Marley,  to diagnostics for our chihuahuas,  even as little as an ear infection. I never feel pushed to have expensive testing or feel forced into any procedure - they give caring advice and have fone the best job with our fur kids big and small!

I was really glad I could take her to a vet on SUNDAY. Saw the Vet not a vet tech. Thought I was doing the right thing to change her food to natural raw food. Wrong. My dog must have gotten bacteria from the raw food. I stopped raw food and gave her pills for itching and to kill bacteria. She is almost well now.  No expensive bloodwork needed
Professional care by Vet. I am very happy with the outcome.<//Review><username>Diane Galway< /username></record>

<text>We had been going to a different vet for quite a long time and got tired of the extremely long waits. So I looked up local vets and found that Warner Ave. Animal Hosp had great reviews and people had commented that they were reasonable, which is what we were looking for. The staff is very caring. Savannah asked questions and did a pre-exam for my dogs rabies vaccs prior to Dr. Black coming in. She was very good and had a comforting way with my dog who is not a friendly dog with people she doesn't know. Then Dr. Black came in who was equally friendly and good with my shy Chihuahua. I like that they give senior discounts and cash discounts. We liked that they had a big screen TV in the lobby. Only complaint is the uncomfortable seating which is a wooden bench. But if it keeps costs down to experience a slight discomfort in seating, it is worth it.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< userid>

<Review>was not happy with the rude receptionist and i didn't appreciate the two literally just trying to sell me everything they could. I will not be bringing my dogs back. It was a $300 bill.. went to a different vet for the same exact tests and symptoms and was only $90..< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80dd26fbb985dab1:0x1a1e39e0d9086663<//gmap_id></record>

Really closer to 4.9 stars. This is the sister to beach city animal hospital. This location stays open til midnite sunday thru thursday - in case your fourlegged kids need emergency care. The staff and drs. are very nice and REALLY CARE about our kids. Both beach city and warner ave. Locations give great service, are knowlegable, efficienct, patient with their patients...AND VERY TOLERANT of the parents and any questions you may have. Prices are fair and you get a discount if you pay cash. My kids have been coming to these two locations for 6yrs and i've always gotten excellent service.  Their late nite hours really came in handy, VCA was the only facility that was open 24hrs , but the cost is more than human ER's. Warner avenue started staying open late and were a Godsend for those 'too serious' to wait situations. THANK YOU warner ave. for working late to ensure our kids get the medical attention needed...WHEN ITS NEEDED.</Review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Ares sees me pick up his leash and runs to break down front door. Juno suffers from PTSD from 3yrs ago and the staff there are amazing. Chris, Hailey, Dan, Sam, Savanah, etc... are amazing. I have referred at least 3 dozen  persons and never heard a negative report. I could not care for my pups without this amazing vet and support staff. Can't say enough great things about them. We have been going to them for 9 years and will continue. Thanks guys and gals from Ares and Juno's gma.<//review>< pictures>

<text>Tried this place today for the first time and I am definitely going back. I had no idea they were even there!!! I am glad I tried it.  The staff was very very friendly. The food was absolutely 💯delicious. It had a homemade by my abuela type of flavor. It definitely tastes like comfort food Mmmmm. The food came well packaged in a to go reusable/microwaveable Tupperware. I ordered 4 Street tacos minus Pico de Gallo and shredded cheese extra limes. Wet burrito with red sauce no refried beans. Wow the tortillas were soft and fresh. The meat was tender so it seemed to be quality meat (had asada) and plenty cilantro and onions. They tasted very fresh Mmmmm. The wet burrito was amazingly good. The red sauce was smooth and very tasty like homemade sauce. Ate it quick because it was like comfort food. Outstanding!! Loved all of it. Will definitely be back for more very very soon. Mmmmmm.....</text>< username>

Tried the menudo and it was less than average. The price wasn’t as expensive as other places but we just wished we would’ve spent the extra $6. One the pieces of tripe was either burnt or spoiled.< /Text>

<rate>5</rate><text>This place was recommended by the employees at Affordable Tire. I walked over to the hole in the wall restaurant and ordered tacos. The ambiance of the place and the smells emanating from the kitchen, immediately reminded me of my Grandma's house. Reminded me of my childhood. When you walk through the door they immediately recognize you as an important customer and make you feel at home. They are polite and the food is excellent, the corn tortillas are hand made and delicious. Seat yourself and enjoy. Remember it is a hole in the wall, so relax and don't be afraid to park across the street.<//text>< pictures>

<Review>The place is small but the food flavor is big! I went in for the pork posole but the were sold out. So instead they gave me the chicken posole, which was really good. I will definitely be back to try the pork because that’s my favorite! I also tried one carne asada taco and one el pastor taco just to see how the tacos tasted. They were both delicious! The meat was seasoned well.
If you want a fancy restaurant this isn’t the place for you. But if you’re looking for good authentic Mexican food you will love this place! We will definitely be back!< /Review>< GmapID>

Place is very clean. We ordered different types of food so we could have a taste of some of our faves we would usually order elsewhere... just starting off they offer really good salsa roja, salsa verde and pico de gallo for the chips (chips are delicious) we bought some to take home for food we
We had Menudo (served with handmade tortillas), wet burrito, asada/lengua fries, chilaquiles and tostada salad. EVERYTHING WE ATE WAS DELICIOUS. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<//review>< Pictures>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>This place was recommended by the employees at Affordable Tire. I walked over to the hole in the wall restaurant and ordered tacos. The ambiance of the place and the smells emanating from the kitchen, immediately reminded me of my Grandma's house. Reminded me of my childhood. When you walk through the door they immediately recognize you as an important customer and make you feel at home. They are polite and the food is excellent, the corn tortillas are hand made and delicious.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<review>Hole in the wall with amazing food.  Everything is cooked to order.  Fresh ingredients and a very hot meal.  And the empanadas are delicious.  They take about 20 minutes but they're worth the wait.  Prices are very reasonable.<//review><response>None<//response><Time>1566526722031< /Time>< rating>

I had this right before I had to come back to Florida. This place was awesome! I enjoyed it immensely. The staff made me and my partner feel at home. The first column goes over the preparation, the second lists the meat/"stuffings". My friend also ordered the plantains; they were very tasty, fried and covered in cheese.< /Review>

I stopped going because the old lady that made the tortillas by hand & cooked your food with love, is no longer there. The people who run it now are very nice, but I think I'm gonna pass on this place now; too many visits/chances for the newbies to get the taste right. #overit<//review><Gmap_id>0x80c2582865eaf83b:0xb3336a759efd44df< /Gmap_id>< Rate>

This place is UN. REAL. I can literally sit there, randomly point and eat, and be sanctified.

Go. There.

As a matter of fact, I am headed there NOW.</Review>

Four of us ordered different dishes (wet burrito & tamale side dish, enchiladas, camarones a la diabla, birria) and everyone said their food was great. I didn't know what birria was and the staff struggled to describe it but I'm glad I trusted them when they recommended it. They even brought out some spicier sauces when I seemed disappointed that it wasn't a spicey dish; very thoughtful but it would have been just fine without them. Food took a bit of time to come out but that's because it was clearly all freshly made.<//text>

I don't care for the chips and salsa, and the refried beans were pretty bland, in my opinion.  But I usually get the tacos anyway. The burritos are HUGE.  My coworkers are more adventurous and try other items, and they like everything they've had.  I would recommend!<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

BEST Mexican food in the AV! I love this place. I've tried almost all the Mexican restaurants in the AV and nothing has come close to this place. The owner is a great guy and all the staff are super friendly, feels like a family environment that welcome you into their house. Only complaint would have to be that is closes at 3 P.M. Other than that if you can get there when it's open it is worth it.< /Text>

<review>After a visit to New Orleans, we were so excited to find a place that has authentic Creole food. The prices are reasonable, but it took awhile to get the food ( a to go order). The good was delicious. Portion sizes aren't huge, but it's reflected in the price. The restaurant itself is a little hole in the wall,.</review>< pics>

It's  ok, just that the tortillas were way too thick for me. I like the meat well done, and the big exaggeration by people I know about it being the best in the valley does not meet my standards. It is nice and clean, and I'm sure people love it;  but it has potential of getting packed, and if you are claustrophobic,  just order in advance and get it to go.</Text>

Quite simply the BEST chicken tacos in the AV.

Guadalajara is a charming little hole in the wall that is one of the best kept secrets in the AV. When you order tacos, they start making the tortillas fresh right then. The food is superb, the staff kind and the location is a little hidden away.</Text>

I've searched the Antelope Valley for the best Mexican food, and I have found it.  Wet burrito is amazing.  True authentic mom and pop, worth every penny.</Review>

The food here was absolutely excellent. The Guadalajara bowl and tortas were the favorites of our group. The tacos were served street style. The chorizo and asada meats were very tasty. Variety is available with the tongue or pastor. Prices were very reasonable as well.< /Review>

The staff is friendly~tacos r good since tortilla is fresh made but the quality of the asada is not the best in town. Plus never have I had a taco in Guadalajara where they put cheese in it...cilantro/onion are the only toppings n chile is always optional~that's it<//Review>

What a great little place walked over after a social event with friends and ordered the hamburger with a side of mashed potatoes: beef burger starting with lettuce, tomato, red onion, mustard and mayo.  My friends had a good time and great food as well.< /Review>

<Text>I've been here 2x. The 1st time was good pero the 2nd time I got the chorizo and egg breakfast and I can honestly say that was the worst chorizo breakfast I have ever had. It didn't smell normal, it was really red and it tasted weird. Maybe if you go, don't order the chorizo! The ladies are nice.</Text><Response>None< /Response></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Altough the place was a bit hidden, the food was delicious. We ordered carne asada tacos and a carne asada wet burrito. The meat was good and having home made tortillas on the tacos was a plus. I'm definitely coming back!<//Review>< pics>

<Review>The Menudo will rock your socks!!! Fresh homemade corn tortillas! And tacos out of this world. Yummy salsa and pico de gallo. Everything made my taste buds dance and sing. I come from a long line of Mexican cooks. Grandma owned her own successful restaurant. I'd bring her here in a heartbeat. Found my new favorite place. Great service, kind caring people own this place. Bring your business.< /Review>< pics>

Great service and great location although the food was not .. I ordered the tacos the meat was pretty bad and tortillas were hand made but also poorly made cold and hard .. On the bright side employees were nice and attentive free chips and salsa</Review>

there really nice people at first but that's just all fake there food is disgusting and when you try to ask him about something that they did wrong with your order they get all offensive they run to take your credit card or your cash from you to pay for your order but they won't run to fix the mistake that they sold you just crazy< /Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>(Translated by Google) The best restaurant if we talk about authentic Mexican food, the very good service they serve you quickly and logically there is a waiting time that is normal, because the food is prepared at the moment, the seasoning of the meats are exquisite, the pozole and the menu They are authentic Mexican flavors and tradition, widely recommended, too bad that mrs. Mary will no longer be part of the Guadalajara taco grill, they say goodbye in 8 days and we will miss their dishes and even more their homemade flavor. Mrs. Mary to you and your family. May God bless you and never forget that you are an authentic Mexican cook. Thank you for the service, the very pleasant talk we had, and remember that we will be your customers forever.

El mejor restaurante si hablamos de autentica comida mexicana, el servicio muy bueno te atienden rapido y logicamente hay un tiempo de espera que es normal, por que la comida se prepara al momento, el sazón de las carnes son exquisitos, el pozole y el menúdo son autenticos sabores y tradición mexicana, ampliamente recomendado lástima que la sra. Mary ya no va hacer parte de guadalajara taco grill, se despiden en 8 días y extrañaremos sus platillos y más aun su sabor casero. Sra mary a usted y su familia que dios la bendiga y nunca olvide que usted es autentica cocinera mexicana Gracias por el servicio, la charla muy amena que tuvimos, y Recuerde que seremos sus clientes por siempre.<//review>< Pictures>

It was a really incredible experience and I walked away with a lot of really great knowledge for just a short intro class. I definitely recommend it as a fun thing to do whether it's to advance your skills or just go there on a date or with a friend! (The picture is of drinks I made in the class!)< /Review>< pictures>

Had a fabulous experience with the intro class. We were taught how to mix 10 most popular drinks recipes in summer 2017. Instruction was very clear. The class atmosphere was fun. Variety of different type of liquors and mixing tools. The great rating of this bartending school is real. I recommend people who want to learn bartending to take the course here :)<//Text>

However, after taking the first class, I know that I could do it in the end, because there are soooooo much fun during the class, and you can remember those alcohol easily by fun practicing.

<review>Amazing course and excellent experience! After taking these classes, I feel extremely prepared having acquired the tools and practical training needed to be job ready. The hands on experience was absolutely invaluable learning how to master essential drinks while maintaining speed and accuracy. Practicing in a bar inspired setting with music, lighting, and full bar set up creates a realistic environment.

Also, beyond drinks, you learn professional skills including opening and closing procedures, understanding tools and equipment, and how to approach customer service in all situations handling diverse scenarios. The real life experiences and lessons conveyed from staff who have extensive bar industry experience was highly beneficial!

Laura is a fabulous teacher! She is immensely knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful! Lessons were very thorough and informative keeping classes fun and educational. No wonder SCBS is rated #1 bartender training school! You will enter the industry confident, capable, and educated. Not to mention learning new creative ways to get your drink on :) Best place to go for all you aspiring bartenders! Cheers!</review><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1505231866744, 'text': 'Lauren!

<text>This place is fantastic!! The instructors are extremely patient and knowledgeable. She responded to emailed questions very quickly and coached on everything from menus to etiquette, covered safe service laws and speed drills! By the time I finished, I'd memorized nearly 100 currently popular bar drinks and their variants and I could make 6 drinks (including muddling and shaking) in under 3 minutes from memory. She helps students find jobs and get to know equipment. We can also pour a perfect ounce and a half per 6 count (so we can do anything in quarter ounce pacing) from standardized bottles. These people are amazing and I'm super happy I chose them!</text><UserId.>113147858962362842751<//UserId.><GmapID>0x80dcd11709fb13cd:0x98ae8ddcd4d76dac< /GmapID><Time>1527909036696</Time><Rate>5</Rate></record></dataset><record>

I was really nervous about throwing the shakers and bottles around, but by the end of the two hours, I was really comfortable. Ray is really good at making each student feel special and he plays to our strengths. Laura is super friendly and even participated in the class. We got to see how she pours and now we want to take the 4 hour intro class. I highly recommend taking a class here, even if you are not a bartender by profession.

<Text>I took this class with a friend and didn’t know what to expect. Mostly took it to support her but ended up learning A LOT ( LIKE A LOT ) and I talk about it with my friends and co workers almost every other day because I have learned so much and have enjoyed the class so much. The content they teach is solid and very relevant. The teacher I had was Riahna and she is an AMAZING teacher with the cutest puppets named Sugar. I also met some amazing students and future colleagues and now friends. Would definitely recommend this school!< /Text><user_id>109951162248993893522</user_id>< time>

Definitely better program for my money with more versatile job offers.  The concept is awesome with an amazing environment.  I like how the staff will help w job placement and the space has a small teacher to student ratio for better attention.  Super excited to get more involved.  What a fantastic opportunity.

The schooling itself is 40 hours of extensive learning and they partner with a local staffing company to help you find a job. Definitely worth the try when you can find an opening to their intro class!</review>< Rating>

I found The Southern California Bartending School on Yelp and the owner invited me to come in and observe a class. The students looked like they were having so much fun I was hooked!

The small class sizes allow people to really learn quickly and get one-on-one attention from the instructors. The speed and agility tests were fun and gave me great practice for "real-life" situations.

Although I wasn't looking for a job in bartending, the school also has a catering staffing company where they send out bartending events if you are interested in signing up. I worked one my first week after graduating from the school. The events are fun, the hosts have been great and some side money here and there is a great bonus.

I was VERY happy with my experience at The Southern California Bartending School and would definitely recommend it to others.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<text>This school is a level above the rest.. I looked and looked and had a good feeling about The Southern CA Bartending School. They seemed to REALLY care and go the extra mile for their students. The program is extremely thorough and detailed but super fun. The instructors are the perfect balance of expert and laid back. They get silly too and encouraged us to be our authentic selves while being a badass behind the bar.

For someone like me who has never had experience behind or in front of a bar I'd have to say that this is definitely a place where you can ease into getting to know numerous drinks and get the 4 11 on how everything works. There's a lot of hands on training and an extensive workbook to backup what you've learned as well literature to help you become more knowledgeable about drink recipes and bartending etiquette.< /text>

Biggest scam in the world! There are no classes. I try enrolling months ago and they cancel the classes and kept the money! All these 5 star reviews are fake. Don't attend at all! Watch out as they will try to sucker you in and make you pay the enrollment fee. And when you do, they refuse to give you your money back and refuse to contact you. The yelp review is fake as well. Deserve a 0 star if I can.< /Review>

I've always wanted to learn how to bartend, and I can't recommend this school enough. I took both the intro one-day course and the two week course. Each instructor has their own flair and wisdom, and all of them are friendly, patient, and welcoming. The courses covered an extensive variety of bartending topics, not just simply how to make a drink (though we got really good at that too! (: ). I definitely learned way more than I thought I would in only 40 hours. Whether you want to take this course to build your career or just for fun, it is a fantastic choice.< /Review>

<Date>1419889500661</Date><Review>This course fed me full of current industry knowledge and gave me a real insiders perspective at how to become a succesful bartender. The role play exercises were a fun way to interact with the fellow classmates but a real reminder of the difficulties you will face having to remember drink orders on top of drink recipes meanwhile holding down a conversation or answering questions. A week later now and I find myself reciting cocktail recipes when looking at menu's which has really surprised me as I truly wondered if I would be able to commit all those drinks to memory. The content was delivered in a straightforward and easy to follow manner with a good amount of practical training behind the bar. I am feeling confident now to start making people drinks and bringing in the tips!<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80dcd11709fb13cd:0x98ae8ddcd4d76dac</Gmap_id><rating>5< /rating></record></dataset><record>
<review>This is a great place to learn and sharpen your skills before diving into your bartending career. Laura and Riahna are wonderful  instructors! They give you a full run down about the industry, provide tips & tricks on mixing today's most popular drinks, and career advice. This is a hands on course, where you'll know how to make 40+ drinks when everything is said and done. If you come to class with the right attitude and the eagerness to learn, you'll come out of here a better bartender and have the confidence needed to be successful.<//review>< user_name>

<review>SoCal Bartending school is awesome. The schedule worked great with my work schedule and Laura was so helpful in answering all my questions. Its very obvious that Laura brings a very educated veteran outlook to bartending.  I graduated with such confidence and ready to join the industry. Laura's established connections in Southern California as well as her Bartending company helped get me an immediate job. Within two weeks of graduation I was working my first gig, and now have a full time bartending job in Long Beach. I highly recommend this school, it will change your life!<//review>< gmapID>

Attended a focus group event for a free intro to bartending course. It was so much fun and I actually learned a lot in the 2 hour class on learning 10 various mixed drinks, bartender's etiquette, and a lot of useful tips. Our instructor Laura was extremely knowledgeable and has a lot of experience in the industry. After that class, I'm definitely considering taking the 40 hour course certification.<//review>

The Southern California Bartending school gives amazing hands on training to become a bartender! The classes are honestly a lot of fun and the speed and accuracy drills are very useful in helping develop your skills and memory for the many drinks you’ll have the pleasure of learning! The instructors are awesome and fun! They give great advise on what to expect and proper bartending etiquette. They also share their own personal experiences of bartending which just excites you more and makes you eager to become a bartender. I definitely will be advising my friends and family who may be interested in becoming bartenders themselves to apply and come to this wonderful school! It was a pleasure to be there and will take my new found knowledgeand skills with me where ever bartending takes me!<//Review>

< Review>
I'm sorry to say this but this place is definitely not as "amazing" as it seems.

I was lured here through all the great 5 star ratings and all the positive reviews, however, I was quite dissappointed. The service is just mediocre, and everything my friend Jacob and I were taught, we could find on youtube tutorials.
There just wasn't enough to justify all the 5 star ratings.

Of course maybe it was just because this was our first time here, maybe this was just the basics? I'm not quite sure. However, we certainly expected a whole lot more.

I'm not even sure if these reviews are real anymore considering how SO MANY of them happen to come in the last week or so and barely give enough detail. They all just say the same stuff over and over again.

Regardless, I'm sorry to say this, and I hope I don't come off as rude or anything, but this place is simply just average at best.

2 stars.

<text>The professional attention given to small classes (8 max) makes for ample opportunities for personal interaction, Q&A, and suggestions for working in the bartending world. Classmates were highly motivated and supportive of one another. I found it interesting that several were tending bar already, but wanted to improve their skills at SCBS. I'm sure they did.<//text><Date>1442715111215</Date><user_id>111733205842502430275< /user_id>< Name>

This class is totally worth it for anyone who wants to gain experience in all aspects of bartending! I took the 40 hour accelerated course and learned everything I needed to know in one week, including bar laws, all the popular cocktails, and full bar practice. Laura is such a great teacher and is extremely patient, welcoming and makes class fun!! I'm now working for an event staffing company as a bartender and have been getting great feedback from potential bars that I would love to work for in the future all thanks to SoCal Bartending School :)<//review>

The Southern California Bartending School was such a great decision, all the teachers are extremely experienced and care about teaching you the right information. This school is such a great way to get your foot in the door to bartending and Laura does her best to provide you with leads and reccomendations for jobs after you graduate. I was personally hired a week after I graduated with absolutely no bartending experience all thanks to this school and the job leads provided! I am very happy I chose to go to the SCBS!!!</text>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>The SoCal Bartending School was so much fun and a great way to learn to bartend!! The classroom was way cooler than I expected, with actual bar set-ups to really get a hands-on learning experience. Anyone can study and read off a drink menu at home but with Laura's classes you can gain the experience behind the bar while learning new drinks each week. SoCal Bartending school was also a great way to learn the do's and don'ts and just the facts/experiences bartenders face that most people don't tell you. I absolutely LOVED this class and would recommend to everyone interested!! :)< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Review>I took the bartending course during the summer and within a month i got a bartending job inside LAX. Laura, the instructor, is really kind and always carries a positive attitude. She really helped me learn the fundamentals of bartending not just making drinks, so it was definitely a learning experience. Best investment ever.</Review>< resp>

I took this class on the spur-of-the-moment, and I'm glad I did.  The class is a load of fun.  I took the accelerated course, which means I had to pack in the studying, which I suggest doing, because it isn't easy learning 70 some-odd recipes, not to mention the other information that you have to memorize, like the classifications of the liquors, interacting with  guests, and the like.
Also probably worth mentioning is the fact that I, before the class, had next to no knowledge about alcohol.  I wouldn't have known my brandy from my bourbon.  I probably wouldn't have been able to pronounce cognac properly.  After the class, I feel way more informed than I could have ever been, even if I taught myself.  There's a lot of information to pack inside your brain, especially in 40 hours, but the destination is well worth the trip.  Even if you don't plan on getting a bartending job after this class, I'd still recommend taking the class, if only due to the fact that you learn so much.  Alcohol is so prevalent around the world that this won't be information that you never use.

tl;dr; Fun, informative, go, now< /Review>

I attended So Cal Bartending School very impressed with Laura and the school itself. I had a blast learning mixology alone with my fellow classmate. Laura has been great through the entire process of learning bartending.
I definitely would recommend taking her class to anyone. Laura takes the time to trained and teach her skills to the public ( great job)  to be carried out within each individual to succeed in bartending.
I where a recent student and recent;y got hire at a major business as a bartender. I took the responsibility to research on my own to find a bartending opportunity and thank God I landed it.
What I'm truly saying is that, don't wait on the school to look for your opportunity reach out and do it yourself
Thanks Laura for having me as a student very much appreciated.
You Rock !!!!< /Review>

Where do I start...

First of all, before I decided to take this class, I was asking one of my friend who has been bartending for ten years to teach me to barten, and he said " yeah no problem, it's easy, don't go to bartending school...", but the problem is he has been super busy at work and the time that we met, we just play golf and just have fun, so I decided to started searching the bartending school with out telling him.

Lots of school pop up on my computer screen. few schools got some really good reviews and one of them is Socal Bartending. I checked all the detail on every school that I was interest in and went through all pictures and everything until I started got a feeling about this school, then I sent an email about some questions that I had, and It got reply so quickly, so I decided to take this class.

First day of the class, everything looks exactly like I thought. the class is really small which is great, so you can being so close to the trainer and ask anything you want anytime. You also have your own station with your buddy who will help you through this course with so much fun. You also have a book ( school's own book ) that will cover pretty much anything that you need to know about bartender. My favorite part about the book is it short and just go right to the points ! I'm sure is you go buy a book for bartending, you probably ending up reading like 100 pages or more.

After I finished the course, I feel like this school just make everything about bartending look so easy to me. I just ended up automatically knowing 70+ main drinks  without trying so hard to remember it. I also feel much much more confidence about bartending knowledge.The lessons that this school prepare will take you step by step until the end, and you're gonna get the same feeling that I have right now.

Thanks again for everything :)

Perfectly balanced and mixed, as all the cocktail receipies we learned. The real plus is that Laura shared her long experience and really knows what she is talking about. She's the best.

<Text>Today I went into Target in search of a Birthday outfit so that I could color coordinate with my daughters when we went out this evening. I met the NICEST employee randomly while browsing thru the women’s clothing department. Her name was Juanita! She went above and beyond when helping me. As I told her about the occasion and what kinda dresses I liked, she started gathering up a few for me. I loved that she gave me advice on which ones would flatter me. I ended up buying a dress and even found a cute crop top outfit that I’ll wear for another night out!!  I wish I could meet more helpful employees like her when I go shopping!! Thank you so much Juanita you are Amazing!</Text>< Pics>

< Review>
Small town target, and not in a good way. Pickup is constantly having issues, fridges are usually full and that’s not of course the fault of employees or anything, but now, as has happened before, you literally can’t even add cold items whatsoever for cold pickup from this store to wait for fridges to be available. Don’t know who’s at fault for this always being down, but you just can’t count on them for groceries whatsoever. Not to mention this is the least allergen-friendly target by goods stocked; way more variety at any Sacramento, Roseville, etc target, but there’s almost never any gluten free bread or other products.

Also, last several times we’ve gotten Crystal milk they’ve gone bad well before their expiration date (usually they’re good beyond expiration), which leads me to think they’re leaving the food out for far longer than they should unrefrigerated (and back when we were in-person shopping we saw this happen frequently, and also check dates as they aren’t very on top of removing expired goods).

There are of course positives, and while it’s been a while most of the associates themselves are nice so not necessarily a reflection upon them, but overall it’s a fairly poorly-managed target when you compare it to others from the surrounding area; I will say it is usually pretty clean however so the associates seem to be on top of that, but likely just not given enough hours and associates to do all the other things that should be done (like removing expired goods, restocking cold items quicker, etc).<//Review>

Excellent selection of all types of items. From food products to clothing,  kitchen, electronics, camping, toys and so much  more. Friendly and knowledgeable staff, restrooms, changing rooms, very large parking  structure, electronic door opening. Quick food stand and a Starbucks inside front of store.<//text>

<rating>2<//rating><review>They've got the store blocked so that you can't go straight to grocery. I feel this is not just a technique to open the register area up but more as a hope that people will splurge buy by having to go around and through aisles which would normally be skipped. The staff are wearing masks, but most of them are under noses and chins, which is protecting absolutely nothing. The dressing rooms are completely closed, which is it's own kind of stupid. Basically, management needs to get a clue and some common sense.<//review>< Pictures>

The store is always clean, organized and well stocked with great prices!

Adding a drive up parking stall marker would be extremely helpful for both the customer and worker. These lost workers are going car-door-to-car-door asking for each driver's last name. Not even using the order number.< /review>

If you've got growing kids, don't even bother trying to buy clothing items for them during this. They aren't allowing things to be tried on and won't allow returns if you get the wrong size. I understand what and why, still find it annoying. Only reason I gave 2 stars is because the gal at customer care was kind and professional. She informed me that once returns open up that I can return my daughters sandals in exchange for a larger size.<//review>

Having just recently moved to the area, I'm finding that most stores in this area lack a decent inventory.  While this Target isn't quite as bad as some stores, it still lacks some items that are easily found in other Target stores in larger cities.  I also have a Target Debit card that I would like to use but unfortunately, I've never been able to get it to work correctly.  I checked my account but couldn't find any problem with the card and set up but it's declined in the store.  Might be time to cut up the card and find another place to shop.</Text>

Cody from the Yuba City store helped me look up and find the memory card I needed, even though it wasn't right out in the open. Really nice guy! I was able to get the clearance price advertised online, and I wouldn't have found it without his help. Cassandra from the guest help desk was also very kind. Thank you guys!< /Text>

<text>Store was clean and easy to navigate. Great deals and the cashier I had was outstanding. Not only were we the dreaded walk in 15 min before closing customers but I was super absent minded. She was helpful and patient then she even ran yes RAN my forgotten bag full of purchased items out to me in my car. She is is so awesome and I feel like you never meet people like her willing to go that extra bit just because they are good people and I think she is probably rare in that way. Best shopping experience I have probably ever had.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x8084acaa14ff0555:0x820b619318e0ede4<//GmapID></record>

Victor did not want to help me at all until I went up to customer service asking for the store managers phone number. Then he decided to tell the associate on the radio to go ahead and give me 30% off. Wow thanks after being upset and then pissing me off and not help me great customer service and wasting my time because they didn't have the price on it. When I asked for the store managers phone number is when he wanted to do something. I could go on and all the long lines that were going on as well looks like he was doing a great job that's enough keep up upsetting customer.</Text><Time>1518488668773< /Time>< Response>

<text>Target in Yuba City, CA is great! The staff members are always friendly and knowledgeable, unlike the staff at Wal Mart. If you can't find an item at Target, you can ask any store associate and they will help you find that item. They don't just tell you to check the Target App and continue on with what they were doing. The staff members at Target have excellent customer service skills. Wal Mart employees could learn a lot from Target staff members.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

We came in to pick up our order and the line was extremely long. They immediately opened another register. I watch them quickly and efficiently expedite each customer in a professional and polite manner. I was through in less than 15 minutes when there had been 9 customers before me. Awesome customer service,<//text>

<Review>Target always has so many great sales and has just about anything you could need under one roof. From food, to clothes, to pharmacy, toys, electronics, auto, crafts, gardening, and so much more! I never leave empty handed. The people are nice, the place is clean, and the lines are usually short. Plus I get 5% off everything with my card. Love it!<//Review><gmap_id>0x8084acaa14ff0555:0x820b619318e0ede4<//gmap_id>< user_name>

<rating>1</rating><review>I just came from your store , i have been buying plums throughout the season at various stores
I saw that you had plums still available, so i just packed a bag full of plums , i get to the selfserve checkout
Your scales dont accept weight by the pound , only by each
So i purchased 18 plums , but then it said .99 each
I refused to pay that , when i got 4 lbs of plumas for $ 7.38 in a health food store
Something wrong with your pricing< /review>< Pictures>

I have to give it an OK experience only because sales personnel seem to always be busy and almost never in their department. I don't know if this is because lack of enough personnel or lack of experience but it is hard to find someone to help you and you are rarely asked if you need help with anything.<//review><username>Gabriel</username><userid>105563560430311287261< /userid><time>1497923468913< /time>< GmapID>

They were open during the evacuation, helpful, made sure we were alright on finding everything. Had some great deals on allot of stuff. You need to find their app "Cartwheel" and use it. You get some great deals when you do.</Text>

Because the website it flawed and said my order didnt process due to error so I replaced the order and ended up getting a email for the original order that said didnt go through in error plus the my other order u put in place of the one I was told didnt go through. My husband wasted two trips to target to pick it up and cancel one of the orders which he was told couldn't be cancelled and told to come back when he went back they couldn't find the order with the barcode I received in the email he was there for over thirty minutes then they said they would give him $25 off the order because of all the hassle then I got a email saying my order was picked up while he was there then they said o never mind it went through and didnt give us a discount after all that time and gas wasted.

The customer service is great.
It’s nice to go into a store and employees actually want to help you😀. The only thing I don’t like about going into the store is I end up spending more than I expected LOL.< /Text>

If I could rate them -5 stars I would. I just dealt with an Extremely rude and VERY unprofessional woman who answered the phone and was too lazy and/or informed about her store/industry so she made a snide comment and then directed me to use my smart phone to find the answer. Keep in mind that my question was regarding a specific retail clothing item for women that I was trying to find in the area. I WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS HERE THANKS TO THAT UNACCEPTABLE TREATMENT AND NON EXISTENT CUSTOMER SERVICE. Well done lady you should be fired for an EPIC FAIL!<//review>

Great electronics department. They actually had the 4K T.V. I was looking for in stock unlike Wal-Mart that said I would have to either go to another store or wait for it to be in stock again.< /review>

< Review>
Had a shop-a-cop on my ass the whole time I was in the store. If she wasn't then she was stalking me and my son in the store. Very frustrating considering I was shopping for my child and I get treated like I am some sort of shop lifter. I don't care if they are trying to do their job, you don't pick people who have $1000 purse wrapped over her shoulder!!! I hate target with a passion..... Will NOT purchase there again. #PickYourShopLiftersBetter</Review>

It's a great store except employees at Starbucks are rude but everyone else is nice :) Make sure you download the cartwheel app and scan items as you shop it comes in handy!< /text>

What is nice about this target is that there is someone willing to assist  you , with any questions. You can always apply for their red credit card. They also have a a great produce selection as well as kids and adults chlothing. Shoe department in general is ok .<//Text>< Rating>

The Target in Yuba City was extremely messy and gave me the feeling that while I was shopping, I was shopping  through what was "left over" from what everyone  else didn't want or it was simply garbage.....I can't express enough how Messy almost every aisle was and how empty the merchandise was giving me the feeling that it was time for me to go as it wasn't worth the time to even look.</text>
