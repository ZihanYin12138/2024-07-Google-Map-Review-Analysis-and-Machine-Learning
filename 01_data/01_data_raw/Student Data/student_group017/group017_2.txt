Incredible food. Service timing was a bit out of sync, but all dishes were excellent. Seafood paella was enormous and definitely the best one I have ever had. All ceviches and small plates we had were also fabulous.<//Text>

Food ingredient quality is pretty terrible, I had the steak nachos and the meat was BOTTOM of the barrel quality, each piece was gristly/ fatty, not an enjoyable meal at all other than the guac on top.
Please invest in better quality ingredients; also not a fan of the plastic cheese you used but this may be preferential as I know some Americans enjoy it.<//text>

<review>I was hungry and I decided to try something like   “Brazilian food”. When saw the name I figured I could find some “familiar “ food. After read Latin Fusion”  I put all my expectations and I had the most wonderful surprise. As a professional cook and former restaurant owner for decades, I can tell you. The food is amazing! Customer service wonderful! This place is so clean! There is only one bathroom and it’s very clean! The only issue is the fact I don’t live in Los Angeles, and I’ll miss this place so bad!! Next time I’ll be in LA, I’ll stop by FOR SURE!<//review><Name>Rachel Sabat Fenske</Name><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Drove from Anaheim to this spot, watched an episode of Tasty and this place was billed World's Best Cuban Sandwiches. They were good, I don't know about world's best. The pork was flavorful, moist and tender. Sangria was a bit of a disappointment, didn't really have any alcohol in it and I ordered a pitcher, ended up leaving most of it. Service was good.<//Review><Rating>3</Rating><UserId.>111313944203653856915< /UserId.>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
As someone who WORKS in the Hollywood and Highland, I gotta say, this is one of my favorite places to eat. Not sure where some of these bad reviews came from, but I assure everyone it’s one of the only places close by that actually makes FRESH food. As someone who cooks for his family at home, that means a lot to me. Especially with Mexican food, if you try to rush things as simple as beans or rice, they will come out uncooked and hard. This place has been 100% consistent with all of my orders. The salsas on the side are delicious! Their food is Creative! Got my co worker addicted recently 😊 Great job guys! You deserve a lot of success!<//Review>

Good food, I got the chicken and beef tacos. Very flavorful and good service.
My friends got the Cuban sandwich and said they were on point!
Didn't give 5 stars because our table and bench were dirty.< /text>

There were a  tv and we all were watching the Barcelona game real Betis,  and he came in and turn it off to put music on. We told him we were watching the game. He put it back on , to come after 5 minutes saying “I need to put my music on because you guys are not paying attention to the game. I told him this is not how to treat customers he told me he doesn’t care. We were six people coming to this restaurant we spent more than $150.

<Date>1531427351175< /Date><text>Terrible service. I will never eat there anymore. Please if you are human DO NOT EAT THERE. This lady with tattoos and glasses with brown hair was very rude. She would also stare at me. She didn't let me stay there for more then five  minutes after i was done eating. My classmates and I were eating peacefully and she interrupted me.  Please do not eat here. She hates her job and does not take it seriously you can tell right away she is frustrated and something is wrong with her.  I asked for her name because i told her i would complain with her manager and she didnt tell me her name. Instead she was very mean and rude. She is extremely disrespectful with all customers. I can promise you if she did it to me she's done it to other customers.  So if your looking for LATIN FOOD GO SOMEWHERE ELSE AND THEY WILL TREAT YOU WITH RESPECT AND LET YOU ENJOY YOUR FOOD NICELY I HOPE THE MANAGER AND OWNER IS READING THIS BECAUSE SOMEONE WITH HER ATTITUDE SHOULD NOT WORK THERE.

Had a delicious meal here about a week ago and already have a return plan. I had the brussel sprouts, polenta and chocolate torte. Yucca fries and bavette were aldo delish. And my mom raved about the burger. Very interesting flavors and friendly staff. Price didn't seem insane either. Interior is nicely done.< /Text>

Waited forty five minutes in line and twenty five minutes for the food at this fast food restaurant. The food is decent but the wait is not worth it. Do yourself a favor and don't wait if there is a line. Unless you have an extra hour of life to spare.< /Text>

<review>To the last post that was givin by Ray Harvey, that is certainly untrue. I was there when the incendent happened. They were not students but 2 young females and a older lady that seem like their mother. The oldest of the girls started harassing the cashier then the mom followed and started doing it as well. I hate when people write bad reviews of people when it’s the customers fault!! it’s so hateful what she wrote!
the nice cashier, her name is Carolina, she was very helpful, nice and understanding. Someone shouldn’t be described like that. The food was outstanding, delicious and it’s very WORTH it. do not believe this review!! EVERYONE DONT LISTEN TO THIS REVIEW ITS VERY UNTRUE!!!</review>< Pics>

Went there yesterday and was expecting the food to be good since we spent $106 but it was TRASH awful disgusting my tacos were horrible the meat tasted plain my tortillas felt like they took them out that tortilla packet you buy at the store and heat them up for like 5 seconds then put the plain meat on them and the salsa was plain as well never going back I’m so dissatisfied and disappointed the other food was bad as well<//Review>

(Translated by Google) It was not advertised because the fryer machine was not finalizing, but the food was very tasty

(Translated by Google) Very sobering and the whole opposite of our expectations. Very touristy crowded and sometimes really grubby corners. The expected glamor of Hollywood is not there.

I didn't like the fact that the one time I took my pet elsewhere, they wanted to make me wait in the car and just take my animal inside, due to covid.  I want to be a part of the appointment, my gosh how am I going to wait in the car and allow a vet, whom I cannot even see treat my fur baby? Not only that, but I haver dropped off many pets for surgery, and they are not traumatized at all when I pick them up, even when an invasive procedure is done without sedation.<//review></record></dataset><record>
<Review>I loved Dr Bob, they were great on the phone. a little rushed when I was there, not very calming,partly due to my PTSD and the Pitbull attack I believe it's just something I'm going to have to learn to deal with even though I thought I was getting close to being over it I am far from it.
I will be seeing Dr Bob in Chester with the new pups Friday I pray that goes a lot calmer</Review>< userid>

Dr. Kasey, Annette, Danielle and Kate are fabulous! My dog, Molly, was miserable. They got her in immediately, did bloodwork and x-rays. Dr. Kasey knew then she had to stay. After some TLC and meds, I picked her up the next day and Molly's doing so much better! I may have lost her if it wasn't for them and I'm so grateful! I highly recommend this office.< /review>

I bring my cat there at least one a month and they are great. Dr. Taylor is an amazing surgeon and the staff are quick to take care of your needs. The office manager, Annette was amazing to help me figure out what I needed to do to improve the well being of my cat. 11 out of 10!!!<//review>

It was very busy and they were short handed, however, everyone was treated with courtesy and as quickly as possible. There is a vet by the name of Todd Taylor that I met for the first time. He was very thorough and repeated my questions to make sure I was clear.  I highly recommend Lassen Veterinary Hospital.< /text>

Great staff! They are very kind and caring.

Update: 2 years later and they are still an amazing vet. Whenever I need them, which is often, they never hesitate to help. They constantly go above and beyond to make sure that we are taken care of and more importantly that my pets are taken care of.<//Text>

<Text>The care is ok, knowledgeable and good surgeons.  There is a major problem if you have an emergency or need to speak to the vet on weekends or evenings after closing.  Either there is no answering service or the answering service cannot get ahold of a veterinarian.  I  am basing this on 5 tries over a period of about a month.  There is sometimes a vet assistant available on Saturday mornings, but only for very routine items and the veterinarians are not available then.  If your pet is healthy all the time, and will stay that way it's entire life--no problem.  But 2 days and all evenings of the week you may not be able to contact a vet which seems to be the norm for this county.<//Text>< user_id>

Charged me for something I specifically told not to do. But did it any way. Very rude cutting me off when trying to speak the tall short hair blonde lady put me on hold multiple different time in a span of 20 mins. And would not reimburse me $. Didn't try to fix the issue they made and didn't fix the problem. I do not recommend this place. This was my first visit and I'm very disappointed on how they treated me with their mistake<//text>

They always have fresh new products from many other brands. I never get tired of their products and I’m a huge fan of the flowers they sell. Amazing rare quality flower for a good price.< /review>

<text>Coming from New Jersey this was my first ever store purchase. It was exactly what I hoped for. Security was friendly. Check in was welcoming. And my bud tender ( I did not get her name ) was so very nice, informative, and just was nice to talk with. Was happy with the variety of products I got and would definitely revisit.</text><pics>None</pics>< response>

I went there and there was only 1 budtender who seemed to not like his job. He was unknowledgeable and didn't try helping, he seemed to sigh and get irritated when i asked simple questions on the weed. The security guy from there actually popped into our side of the window and told us we can’t  open our weed. It’s not like we were gonna smoke it there! How nosy !! Worst experience ever here. I rather go to NHPR they have better service.<//Text>

I guess if you're there to purchase cannabis this is the place for you however if you're there to buy a gift for somebody you have to give up your ID and register with them didn't care to register there for buying a gift for somebody there's a bad idea if you want to buy a gift for somebody go to a tobacco shop which is what I did where I didn't have to feel interrogated just to buy a gift for someone< /Text>

<text>Nice dog park. Well behaved dogs. A lot of dirt. Someone complained about the 2 hour parking limit. That is only on school days and in effect until 3 pm. That's because it's near the high school and they don't want students parking there. I've never seen anyone ticketed. Lot can fill up on weekends sometimes but usually not a problem. In the mornings and evenings, you can see hot air balloons in front of the mountains. Nice.</text><GmapID>0x80dc0887c14bb4c1:0x2f18bc271b0ec651</GmapID><user_name>Eliot Steele</user_name><resp>None<//resp>< UserId.>

Big park, far from the main road. Has a sizable play ground and big ball play area. Some trailheads start here.<//Text>

This playground is fantastic.  The area is gorgeous.  The park and playground is kept up to perfection.  It is very sad and upsetting that the dog owners don't respect the rules on the playground and clean up after their dogs..... especially when the dog playground is right next door.</review>

Big fenced dog park. Nice medium/small playground. Good sized field with poor grass quality. Trailhead for lots of hiking. Limited parking.< /text>

(Translated by Google) Very nice park, relatively small, has an area of ​​playground and an area of ​​grass, there is also a beautiful view of urban nature. Near there is a dog park.

Go to spot. Small time mom and pops feel, food never disappoints. Only place where I've seen it's cheaper to get a dozen oysters that half a dozen😂. Modelo and Corona on tap, some of the best micheladas in town. Also serve alcohol if you don't like beer.</review>

Had camarones rancheros to go, and they didn't remove the poop in the back of the shrimp, flavor wasn't that good. But they do give you a small portion of salad aside wich is nice from them.<//text>

<Review>One of my favorites. I love their Huevos Rancheros any motning, especially on Sunday. Classic Menudo.

The place is older than dirt but ALWAYS clean. The owners and staff are always welcoming and helpful. You can tell they care. It shows in the food. Each and every plate is authentic and cared  for. Go see the crew at Bahia if you love good food.<//Review><Name>Tom Loge'</Name><Resp>None<//Resp><user_id>117326899950411411329</user_id>< rate>

< Review>
It is inexpensive and needs to be remodeled inside this restaurant, however the food is fantastic and earns 5 stars. It is great for takeout, my favorite is the steak burritos.
Also if they fixed up the interior of the restaurant then they would most likely have to increase the food prices.</Review>

Quesadilla de asada was ok, meat had no flavor and was small bits.  Overall it was small and came plain with no toppings, $8. Maybe I will try something else next time since this place has good reviews.</text>

< Review>
I've been here a few times and always enjoy the food. The salsa is pretty epic, Iin fact. Last time I was there the guy who took my order was great and happily let me have a special order of something that wasn't exactly on the menu (but they had all of the ingredients for). He was really friendly and seemed to enjoy giving good service. Today was a different story. The lady that took my order absolutely refused to modify my order. I couldn't even get a scoop of guacamole on the side, even if I paid extra for it. No, I would have to get a big tub for $5. I really should have left since there is no shortage of good Mexican food on this street. Honestly, I just stopped since I needed a break from driving (Santa Barbara to Santa Monica). She really wasn't nice at all. I doubt I'll ever go back, you can literally walk to other good food in the area from here. Maybe it's harsh but I'm more selective these days with who gets my money.<//Review>

< Review>
IN THE MID 1950'S THIS RESTAURANT WAS KNOWN AS ROLLY'S  RESTAURANT AND IT WAS LOCATED AT THE CORNER OF OXNARD BLVD AND FORTH STREET. IT PRIMARILY SERVED AMERICAN DISHES, OVER TIME THIS RESTAURANT HAS BEEN CONVERTED INTO A MEXICAN RESTAURANT. THE INSIDE OF THE RESTAURANT IS ALWAYS VERY CLEAN INSIDE AND OUT SIDE. THE OWNER RENE WAS A COOK AT THE WELL KNOWN CIELITO LINDO RESTAURANT FOR YEARS  LOCATED ON OXNARD BLVD. COUNTRY, SUPER STAR SINGER WILLIE NELSON AND OTHER CELEBRITIES ENJOY RENE'S CHILI RELLENOS AND GROUND BEEF ENCHILADAS. DURING THEIR  VISIT TO OXNARD  WHILE THEY RECORDED  WILLIE NELSON CD AT THE OLD MOVIE THEATER ON OXNARD BLVD BETWEEN  6th AND 7th STREET, AFTER DECADES OF  OWNING BAHIA RESTAURANT, RENE STILL SERVES THE INCREDIBLY CHILI RELLENOS AND BEEF ENCHILADAS AND OTHER GREAT DISHES. ONCE YOU TRY RENE'S CHILI RELLENOS AND ENCHILADAS I AM SURE YOU WILL BE BACK.
P.S, IN 1954 I WAS 10 YEARS OLD AND I WOULD WALK INTO ROLLY'S RESTAURANT DAILY TO SELL THE OXNARD PRESS COURIER NEWS PAPER TO CUSTOMERS FOR A NICKEL. THOSE WERE THE GOOD OLD DAYS GROWING UP IN OXNARD " THE PRESS COURIER'S PRINTING DEPARTMENT
WAS ACROSS THE ALLEY NEXT TO THE POST OFFICE ON 4th AND C ST.

Came here for dinner one evening.  Not crowded.  Ordered the Caldo de siete mares which was wonderful!  The soup came with seven different seafoods: clam, muscle, scallops, shrimp, octopus, fish, and crab which was reasonably priced.  Would definitely come back again.  Waitress spoke little english but we made out just fine.<//text>

If you're corgial, they will reciprocate.  I get a hug every time I'm there. I initiated it, the hug,  the first time, and tipped well.  It's been wonderful since.
It's been there at least 6 years, since I was introduced to this gem of a place.  Kudos go out to the chefs, also.<//Text>< pictures>

October 2020 update. They are now open Friday-Sunday serving food. Socially distant, to go orders. Same great food, great price. Please support the temple during these hard times, it does affect them as well. I will offer time volunteer more now.< /Review>

On the weekends they have a small food court serving home made Thai dishes. About $7 to $10 a dish. Above average food, not great<//review>

Me and my family decided to go to this temple to celebrate Thai New Year and it was the best decision we could have made as a family.  Everyone was so friendly.  The food was incredible.  I will definitely come back with my family and maybe bring a few of my friends.  This experience must be shared!< /Review>

<text>One of the Best Thai Temples in SF bay area,
They have english speakers available and have English Buddhist books for free should you want to know more or study about buddhism.

On top of welcoming ALL visitors you can come every sunday to buy authentic Thai food and sit and visit or pick up some to take home.

Everyone is friendly and you will leave with a smile on your face once  you visit with the people, from the Land Of Smiles.<//text></record></dataset><record>

The place is very small but it is enough for any buddhist activity of one or two family. They sell Thai food every Sunday for lunch meal and full of people around 12.< /text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) It is a Thai temple, you can pray, learn from a very special culture and eat many new dishes for your palate. If you want to open your mind this is the perfect place. The people who "work" here are very friendly and patient with whom we have no idea what happens. They cook every Sunday to sell to the public, EFFECTIVE ONLY !!! I recommend it 100%

<Review>Happy to find Go-staff when I was looking for an excellent job. They helped me with frequent job recommendations till I got a really well-paying job. Their database is incredible, so they had no trouble finding the right job for me in a relatively short period. I would recommend this place if you want to get placed in just a few weeks. The team is professional and very helpful.</Review><resp>None<//resp><Pics>None<//Pics>< name>

Go Staff helped me find the job of my dreams. I’ve spent months looking for a job that would be a good fit and I couldn’t find anything. That’s when I decided to try Go Staff services on a recommendation from my friend. I was not disappointed! After a detailed interview I got a great position in a company near my home. I couldn’t believe my luck! I highly recommend them to everyone who is struggling to find a job. It is life-changing.<//text>

The best thing about them is that they work with you every step of the way to find a job. I’ve been steadily employed for over a year now and I am very thankful for all their efforts. Working on my second job after my first contract and this even better than the first. Landed a higher paying job and on the lookout for something even better. Thanks guys!</review>

<Review>I have been with Go Staff for around 3 months and been working steady every week. In time at least 3 companies always request for me and that's a good thing. Now I've been told I will be working with just 1 construction company full time for a while and that's a start to finding a good paying permanent position at a growing company. Thanks a lot Go Staff! 🙂< /Review>< pictures>

Go-Staff is a professional and serious company that truly cares about helping their clients. They have a good database and choosing the right candidates was really smooth and easy.

The company is based on good database and they make choosing the perfect candidates quite easy and convenient. Additionally, they are really cool to work with and also completely organized, if you must know. I totally recommend this company, especially if you're looking for candidates as soon as possible.</Text>< name>

So, when I contacted Go-Staff it appears that there are a lot of good job opportunities for me. The company is truly a combination of expertise and experience. I am really happy with the excellent results and my new job!<//Text>< Rate>

<review>Not your typical staffing firm. They care a lot about their temps and it's shown in the placements I've gotten. Both have been with great companies that were a perfect fit for my skills. They checked up with me regularly just to see how I was fitting in and to see if there was anything they could do to make me happier. When I realized the first company I was with wasn't looking to turn my position into a full-time one, I requested a change and they made it happen, no problem. They even talked with the employer to make sure there was a possibility of them eventually hiring full-time - provided I did a good job, of course. I'm much happier now and I feel like I can finally get my career started thanks to Go-Staff.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<review>It almost felt like a hopeless case. Though I am an experienced customer service representative, I was having a hard time finding an appropriate job (I even started losing confidence in my knowledge and skills...) Go Staff helped me regain my confidence, go through a tough interview process and, ultimately, land a job that I love!

The kudos go to the skillful staff who quickly understood what would suit my needs and career goals and provided workable options without wasting my precious time.

I continue getting follow-up check-ins from them, so I know they do care about my success well beyond the job offer is received.

Thank you!</review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

I could not believe I would be able to find a new, steady job so fast. I met with their friendly and professional staff, who took the time to learn about my qualifications and what I was searching for and then made a suggestion for a position I was happy to try. The interview was organized in the following week, and here I am enjoying my new job I could not possibly have found without Go Staff!< /Text>

They work with all the biggest and most established businesses in the area from what I can tell. I've gotten placements with companies I'm not sure I would have been able to work with if I didn't go through Go-Staff. I'm still waiting on one of my temp positions to turn into a full-time job, but I know it won't be long with all the help they give me and the great placements I keep getting!</Review>

A friendly, motivated, and knowledgeable team that is committed to assist you in finding your dream job. It took only a week after I contacted them, and I was invited to an interview.

<review>Go Staff had an ad on Craigslist for warehouse and delivery driver.
I went to the appointment and did the application plus a test it took over 2hrs!
They never returned my call to inform me about the job offer and the very next day I received a text message and a email for jobs that are out of state!
Go Staff sold my info to other agencies without my consent.
I warn everyone to ask what job offer you’re applying for don’t just give your info to this branch or to this company!!< /review>< Resp>

I have never gotten a bad placement with Go-Staff. They take the time to learn both what my qualifications are and what I want instead of just shoving me in the first available cubicle like other temp firms.

It's a place where you have to show a little bit of perseverance and show up daily. You can get a gig that becomes on going but may have to bounce around from job to job for a while to get to that.</Review>

I applied online to work events in San Diego and received a call soon after from Go-Staff and got a interview the next day. Go-Staff's interview process was easy and Chloe put me at ease. I was able to fill out all the paperwork after that and was able to work my first event, a Grad night party the next day. I like the flexibility with the events schedule and that I am also able to pick up additional hours in administrative work as well. Downside, I wish there were more events more often.</text>

I don't trust the people they assign us anymore after two incidents of theft that happened lat year. The culprits were from their agency, and though there was not a lot of damage, we decided to not outsource our staff from their company again.<//Text>

<rating>1< /rating><pics>None</pics><Text>I was working here previously and it was one of the worst working experience that I've had. I was constantly overworked but my efforts and hard work were unappreciated by management. It's as if the management expects their employees to always work beyond normal hours and if they do, it's not like they're working hard, but they think that they're just doing exactly what they're expected of. Don't expect any recognition or appreciation for working late every day. Don't expect promotions, pay raise, incentives and bonuses - they don't have it here. If you come across job openings from Go Staff, just stay away. It's not worth it.</Text><gmap_id>0x80dbffba6ba97d59:0xbf89611131867fa0< /gmap_id><date>1572935227805</date>< Resp>

<review>I can personally attest that the communication at this establishment is remedial at best which is rather unfortunate since most of the staff seem friendly and competent enough. I turned down 2 prior interviews to meet with a recruiter and that was a huge mistake. After back and forth emails that seemed to indicate that my expertise and services was needed, I instead upon arriving was bounced around to another team member whom was not receptive of my observations that the online complaints about miscommunication and people wasting other people's time seemed to be valid. How can I with confidence as a Canvasser be confident in relaying to prospectable clients that the agency operates with efficiency when in reality, communication and personnel satisfaction is lacking at times and no one takes the time to address and correct it? Needless to say, my tenure their is short lived to non existent and that is unfortunate since I had much to offer.</review><user>115862495484245015618< /user><Gmap_id>0x80dbffba6ba97d59:0xbf89611131867fa0<//Gmap_id>< Response>

<Review>I got " hired" but never got work, and when I called they didn't say anything, only, "keep checking your emails?"... Two years later still nothing in my emails. Thank God for my new job. Its Better, and they actually communicate with me. This company(Go- Staff) needs to work on communication skills and letting people know for sure if they have a job or not just emails, so they can hurry up, to get rid of someone.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<text>Go Staff Go Away.

The most horribly run family business. They think they are the mafia of the industry. They'll spy on you, and do anything they can to prevent you from hiring individuals at full time and better pay. So many I've meet that are hungry and can't get enough work from them, and they are threatened  never to be used again if they seek additional employment from there competitors or take full time work from the temp job. Why would any human being deprive people with family some relief they can come home and feed them. Brooke, you and your family are the most disgusting and greed ridden company I've ever known. Also, they force the employing company to sign into a contract the day they bring the employees without prior knowledge. Let's not even talk about the pay such a greed ridden company, they pay the minimum wage while the average job pays 30-30% more. The most disgusting family run business I'm aware of. Brooke, the daughter of the owner is an absolutely Cockroach. Do yourself a favor, go elsewhere, and by the way, Im told from there former employees, (the ones that have worked for me) if the don't give them a favorable review, they won't place them. If I can give below a star, I'd gladly do so.

<review>They helped me find employment in less than a week. All I had to do was send in my application and answer a few questions over the phone. The next time I heard from them, they had a placement for me. They took all the stress out of finding a job. Hopefully I don't have to use them again but I would in a heartbeat if I needed to.<//review>< pics>

<review>staff is awesome, but this place is a joke.

the chart stipulating what you owe them at the end of the year according to what your hourly pay is was pretty special.

not being told what the business model is and how it works is pretty special. check out the first line of their I-9. it's the last onslaught of computer interaction they put you through (office skills testing, some critical thinking assessment, and finally their "paperwork"), and you tell me if anything was "offered" to you.

next issue was agreeing to adhere to their employee handbook regulations and whatnot...only there were never any terms to read.

having an agreement in which one gives up their filming (and using likeness of) consent is special, too.

i would like to mention that the day after i posted this review, go staff called me regarding this posting, but referred to it as my yelp review. i don't use yelp. this means they used the personal information i left in office to contact me.<//review>< Pics>

I heard about Go-Staff from a friend who found a job through them, and I was pretty happy with the help I got. I'd never used a job finding service before, but it's really cool how they help people. I've got a steady job that I'm happy at now and I'm not sure I could have found it by myself.<//Text>

I am so thankful to go staff!  I was ready to get back to the work force but really scared of just jumping in. i hadn't worked for almost 3 years so i did not think they would give me a chance. I submitted all the required information and paperwork to them and within 3 hours i got a call to come in and interview and see what they had for me. That same day i had an interview with a company. I nailed the interview (of course) and within 30 days of working with the company go staff set me on the interview with I quickly proved to the employer and Go Staff that i was more than ready for the work force. I have been fully employed with the employer and am completely grateful and appreciative to them for the help they provided me.<//Text>

Go-Staff did exactly what I couldn't do, found me a job. I applied on a Friday and received an interview right away the following Tuesday. Noelle was the girl I interviewed with. After my interview she recommended I fill out my W-2 with them so I would already have that done in case a job I would be a good fit with came up. Before I was even done filling them out she informed me of a position I was a good fit for and asked me if I could start Monday! She found me a job in less than a week after I had been searching for 9 months. I was a temp at the company for 4 months and they liked me enough they hired me on permanently. If you tell them what you want, they will find it for you. It's because of Go-Staff I have a job and I will always recommend them to anyone I know looking for work.< /Review>

I signed up at Go Staff about 4 weeks ago for "events".  After Justine got me signed up, I was immediately given an opportunity for 3 "events" jobs.  Since then, I have had at least one opportunity to work every week so far.  The staff is pleasant and responsive and very easy to work with.  If you are looking for an easy to work with agency, this is the one!</Review>

Do Not come here! They told me they had a job for me and they just needed all my information like social security , I'd , ect I even took a drug test passed. It's been few weeks and I haven't got a call back. I call staff agency and they told me to just wait than they tell me that the job is no longer available. But now they have all my personal information everything sounds really scetchy. I don't want this to happen to anyone else. Don't give out personal information to these people 😡</text>

I set an interview appointment and everything seemed to be going fine. The representative that I worked with was pleasant and said that if she found a suitable position she would contact me. However, if she did not contact me to give her a call in a couple of weeks. It has now been over 2 months and I have contacted them multiple times but still no job. Horrible at what they do which is suppose to be finding work for people. DO NOT RECOMMEND.</Review>< pics>

A complete waste of time and gas money. I made an appointment well in advance, collected all papers, got all my references in order, and I was told that I had to complete a time-consuming run-of-the-mill online application and head to the DMV to get another driving record and that the appointment wasn't really a thing.

Don't waste your time here.<//review>

<Review>I had a great experience with Go-Staff.  I applied and interviewed all within one hour.  I was called back that same day with an offer that fit my needs!  I would recommend Go-Staff to my friends.< /Review><userid>108737439829547177363<//userid><Rating>5</Rating></record></dataset><record>

This company is horrible! The recruiters are very unprofessional, are young and immature, and Kelsey McClain who is their boss is the worst of them all. She's a liar.

One step into the office and you'll realize that the owners only care about lining their pockets with cash. The place is a dump. I was more dressed up than anyone in the office. They rushed through the interview, didn't ask questions pertinent to my job skills and experience. And Kelsey didn't seem to care about learning about my experience or what I was looking for.

They never followed up in a timely manner whether it was emails they promised to send or phone call follow ups. And to top it off they walk around the corner and bad mouth other candidates sitting in the waiting room....hello...we can all still hear you!

Very unprofessional company!</Review>

They don't know the concept of following up with candidates. Like many others, I ditched another interview for a position they claimed I was fit for. After long interviews, they told me to wait for the results that will be shared in a few days. It's been 2 months, and I've heard nothing. At least have the courtesy to tell a candidate that he or she was not selected.< /Text>

The staff at the metro San Diego location are incompetent and very rude. If any of these people worked for me, I would fire them and replace them immediately. Unfortunately, there was not a rating for anything below one. Because one star is way to much credit for this office. Realistically, I would give them a ZERO.< /text>

This company is a joke. They will not tell you about fees for certifications for the job you will be working until you need to pay. Staff is lost and lacks communication. Cooperate will lie to the unemployment agency. The list goes on. They have had a couple lawsuits for labor laws broken! Don't waste your time. They don't have jobs worth applying for!<//text>

Go-Staff was an easy choice for finding workers in a time crunch. We anticipated that we would be running short on construction staff, so we contacted Go-Staff and they sent us more than enough applicants that met our requirements and started work the next day. Problem solved! All thanks to Go-Staff!< /Text>

On top of that, I have been getting great follow up check-ins from Jeanmarie which really shows commitment to customer service. It was an easy start up with their temp agency, checks were always accurate and on time, and the staff were always there to help if I ever had any questions.

<rate>1</rate><Review>Offered an open position at Prava Construction (their long-term clients).  Got a phone interview on Tues at 9am. Asked to call the owner, Glenn of Prava Construction.

Called & he wasn't available.  Left a message.  Informed Go-Staff & turned out it was Go-Staff's mistake for not confirming phone interview.  No big deal.  Rescheduled for same day at 2pm.  Was asked to call Glenn again.  Called him but no answer.  Left him another message.  Informed Go-Staff again.  Got another phone interview rescheduled for the same day at 5pm, this time on his cell.

Called Glenn at 5pm on his cell.  It went straight to voicemail.  I left another message & informed Go-Staff.  They made excuses for Glenn at Prava & for themselves.

At this point, I requested that if Glenn wanted to interview me, he can call.  Go-Staff agreed but still pushed for me to keep calling him for a phone interview.

So let me get this straight ... according to Go-Staff, Glenn called them after each failed attempt of mine to connect but he couldn't call me himself??  Is this weird, yet unprofessional, business practice on both Prava Construction & Go-Staff or is it just me?

It's the following day & I still have not received an update on what happened & status of the phone interview nor why Glenn, the owner of Prava Construction (Go-Staff's long-term client) didn't pick up nor call me back.

This is the first time I've applied to any of their jobs & it was a very poor, weird, unprofessional experience.  I value my time as a job-seeker & Prava Construction should, as well.

Above all, Go-Staff needs to show their job-seeking clients more respect. No one needs to call repeatedly for a phone interview with a 'long-term' client & feel like they're begging or jumping through hoops.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80dbffba6ba97d59:0xbf89611131867fa0</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

They got me the job Ive been looking for since I moved down from ventura county to san diego! I searched for about a month & no luck, until i went directly to go staff. Amazing i must say, as soon as i join, I want to say I got hired about 2 or 3 days after then after completing my hrs with go staff got hired to the company I'm working right now. Definitely wanted to show my appreciation to go-staff employees & the company for making stress free & easy to get this job that I absolutely love. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.</text>

<Text>This company is a total ripoff they hire felons and convicts to come to your jobsites most are worthless the others walk off the job because the scope of work is too hard. When you call to get another worker they are worse than the first one. None have cars so the sales people drive them around. The female sales manager I deal with has been there forever and is rude manipulating aggressive and down right nasty. They talk you in to signing up as an exclusive client to get a discount but what they don't tell you is that now you can't call another temp agency to get help or they will back charge you a lot of money stay away from this place I requested numerous times to talk to one of the two owners and neither of them would speak to me. The sales girl said they do not talk to clients that's we we are for??? What company owner will not speak to a client that is upset with their company? There are many other staffing companies that specialize in construction not a rent a bum company like go staff< /Text>< pics>

Fun ice cream shop with classical flavors and also a mix of very delicious Latin inspired flavors. I tried a new flavor for myself which was the rose pistachio ice cream. This usually comes as two separate flavors but I’m actually a big fan on how it turned out. It’s creamy, has pistachio taste and also a really nice rose aroma. For sure worth the try if you want to be a little adventurous!</text>

Their ice cream have a very creamy texture with just the right amount of sweetness. I tried this place under my cousin's recommendation a few years ago and came here ever since.</review>

Great flavors and choices for ice cream. Tasted like the ice cream was made with full fat cream instead of non fat milk. Thick and creamy so it doesn't run off so fast. The fruit toppings added a visual look and appeal to newcomers like myself and my bf. Glad we went here by sheer luck. The price for the ice cream was a little high but what do you expect for quality service. We got a pineapple coconut ice cream and it wasn't over the top sweet like some others would make it.<//text>

Great ice cream, I love guanatos ice cream. I only wish that they could check if everybody has their masks on because last time I was there I felt really exposed and uncomfortable because its like people are not taking care of themselves.<//text>

<review>I've only ever had their ice cream and have tasted their soursop & guava sorbets.  Their ice cream have a very creamy texture with just the right amount of sweetness. I tried this place under my cousin's recommendation a few years ago and came here ever since. I've also brought people here when they visit us, and they also liked their ice cream. FYI: there's usually a line here on the weekends, especially during the warmer seasons. Their servers have always been nice and very patient when you want to try different flavors.  Love this place.<//review>< Rate>

The ice cream tastes amazing and the employees there are awesome as well. The parking lot area might look a little run down but the inside is great, very clean.</text>

Guanatos has great ice cream, it's personally my favorite ice cream shop. They have a great variety of flavors, the establishment is very clean and the service is quite fast.
Be prepared for a little wait time in hot days, this little establishment sees a lot of business.</Text>

<Text>Nice cream. Lots of unusual tropical flavors. Made a hot day better. My only wish is that they had indoor seating. It was a pretty hot day and we were forced to take our ice cream and sit on the bench out front in the 93° heat. Good ice cream though.<//Text>< pics>

<text>I go out of my way to eat ice cream at this place. They flavors are fun and it definitely leans toward more Mexican style ice cream and flavors but I guarantee you will find something there you will enjoy. My personal favorite is their chamarindo ice cream made with chamoy and tamarindo. In addition they offer more then just ice cream. They offer traditional style Mexican fruit cups and popsicles.

At the time of going there it was $3 for a scoop but they heap that cup full to the brim.</text><Response>None</Response><rate>5< /rate><date>1549225144094<//date>< username>

Good ice cream... however even with 4 employees they take too long and I think it's got to do with the counter set up.
Why don't  they have a line for ice cream and one for the other stuff they sell?
I get it it is a small place but it can still be done< /Text>

Best ice cream in the immediate 15 mile radius. Great flavors and a variety of sweets to fix your craving. The arroz con leche and mexican chocolate are two favorites. They also have a sugar free pecan which also amazing.< /review>

I visit this location today and i had thr worst esperience ever. I request a banana split and requested for them to put it in a Round cup and they refuse to put it in a round cup, like really the just said NO and i also reuqeted for my banana to be cut in small spieced and was ignore. This is my second time first time was great but second time was not happy at all. They had new staff today and didnt know what they were doung they looked conetely lost. Very unorganize. I would like to talk to the owner about this matter hope they read it and xontact me.<//Review>

Delicious ice cream made in house, lots of variety in both classics like chocolate, strawberry, etc, and less common flavors like tequila, horchata, Mexican chocolate, etc.

Shakes and malts, floats, coffee smoothies... I think they make frozen bananas and other snacks too. I've tried the Mexican chocolate, strawberry, tequila, , so I plan on trying everything they make.</text>

This place is always closed early. Once I stopped by at 7:30 pm and store hours say they close at 8:00 pm. They had the closed sign out and didn’t want to let us in because they were, “closed”. Also, they always take a long time to attend their customers.< /Review>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>(Translated by Google) For more than 10 years I have bought ice cream here, I loved the natural and delicious flavors, I never cared about their price because they were delicious, and now I find that the quality and the attention have gotten a lot worse. Today September 6, 2020 I bought 3 split bananas and they all came with mixed flavors 😡, the size was reduced, and the taste of each ice cream was the same, (sugar with milk 😠 the flavors of the fruits were not distinguished as before) That indicates that the quality of the ice cream is terrible, and to top it all the prices have increased, if only the prices had increased but the quality and the service were the same it would not be so annoying 😠. No more Guanatos for me.

Durante más de 10 años he comprado helados aquí, amaba los sabores naturales y deliciosos, nunca me importó su precio porque eran deliciosos, y ahora me  encuentro con que  la calidad y la atención ha empeorado muchísimo. Hoy 6 de Septiembre del 2020 compré 3 bananas split y todas venían con  los sabores confundidos 😡, el tamaño lo redujeron, y el sabor de cada helado era igual, (azúcar con leche 😠no se distinguían los sabores de las frutas como antes ) lo que indica que la calidad del helado es pésima, y para colmo los precios los han incrementado, si tan solo hubieran aumentado los precios pero la calidad y el servicio fuera igual no estaría tan molesta 😠. No más Guanatos para mi.</Text>< Pics>

<review>(Translated by Google) Their snows are delicious but the only detail is that the website says it is open and when one arrives at the place it is closed. That's a bit disgusting.

<text>(Translated by Google) So I know that ice creams are delicious but who in Ice cream guanatos go too far the prices are too high. I think that it should drop a little price because if I better Boy to the store and it comes out much cheaper thus buying cones, snow, or anything that I like to add I would spend much less than they give them in guanatos because only a banana split It comes out almost $ 10 dollars and besides it is very small in a small plate that is served to you.

(Original)
So yo se que los helados son deliciosos pero a qui en guanatos  Ice cream se pasan de raya los precios son demaciados altos . Pienso que debería bajarle un poco de precio  pues que si mejor Boy a la tienda y me sale mucho más barato así comprando conos,nieve,o cualquier cosa que me guste agregarle  gastaría mucho menos  de como los dan en guanatos por que solo una banana split  sale casi $10 dollars  i aparte está muy chiquito en platito que te lo sirven .Creo vale la pena mejor comprar yo las cosas y así me  aero también de estar esperando parada en el sol.< /text><Name>Ladisblogs g.o</Name>< Response>

(Translated by Google) The ice creams are very delicious, but I will not buy the ice creams again, they removed the sign of using the masks or face masks, which is regulatory, in these businesses, we cannot risk getting infected, because of the irresponsibility of you.

Los helados muy deliciosos,pero no volvere a comprar los helados,quitaron el cartel de usar las mascaras o tapabocas,que es reglamentario,en estos negocios,no podemos arriesgarnos a contagiarnos,por culpa de la irresponsabilidad de uds.</review>

(Translated by Google) The attitude of one of her employees ... Mut bad order a banana split did not give me how it was worth asking and I answer very despot if I can give him what I am missing in a base and of course I said k no k if mela could prepare as deveria set and medijo k I could not have anything k once k I play what I buy can not haggle anything and k if I did not want to do things in the base then I would have to lose my money .... But as scrubbed kieren k one seat counts k what k orders is right or wrong obia mind k has k grab it or touch it when they give it to be able to realize k is wrong ... And then it was excused with k the girl who prepared the banana split was new ... Ok new but as they left her alone preparing or attending to her alone, they would have to see! ... See and try when they or you as employees commit in error if they cannot grab the product back and fix it, give the reimbursement or throw away the poorly prepared product AND RETURN TO PREPARE IT WELL ... it is the second time that you have go bad customer service ...! In customer guanatos since k opened and NOOOO I THINK BACK BY UNATERSERA K SAD THOUGHT K FOR WORKERS OF BAD CHARACTER YOU LOSE CUSTOMERS OF YEARS AND DE3 A4 SEEINGS A WEEK

Pero como fregados kieren k uno sede cuenta k lo k ordena esta bien o mal obia mente k tiene k agarrarlo o tocarlo cuando selo dan para poder darse cuenta k esta mal ... Y despues se escuso con k la muchacha k nos preparo la banana split era nueva ... Ok nueva pero como la dejaron sola preparando o atendiendo ala jente a ella sola deverian .!.. De ver y tratar de cuando ellos o ustedes como empleados cometan in error si no pueden agarrar el producto paratras y arreglarlo dar el rembolso o tirar el producto mal preparado Y VOLVER A PREPARARLO BIEN ... es la segunda vez k tengo mal cervicio al cliente .!..

It’s always terrible. If you actually want to pick up your rental anywhere near the scheduled pickup time show up an hour early. There’s always a line and it moves at about 1 customer every 15 minutes. I’ve been in line for about 20 minutes and there are 6 people in front of me. The three customers I’ve overheard so far are all trying to figure out why the truck they reserved is not here. Does not bode well for me.</Text>

A person at one of the places gave me a  e tral phone number for uhaul and they did alltthe work. AllI had.to.dk was go there and use the QR scanner on my phone.and on.my drivers license.and drive away.

<Review>I called to make the appointment to install a trailer hitch and brake controller ... the sales person I spoke with did not understand the difference between a flat four connector and a 7 pin connector ... so after explaining why I needed the 7 pin the sales slip I received in an email still said 4 pin and no controller .... I called right back and spoke with the sales person from my previous call then he handed me off to an installer...,who got it and spec'd what I needed; but I never received a new email confirmation....a week later my daughter makes the 1.5 hour trip for our appointment ... only to be told the hitch did not come in and they don't have time anyway... I had an appointment... they should have called.. so we set another appointment for a week later..  my daughter gets there and calls me because they're trying to tell her I ordered a 4 pin connector ... she is not a professional trailering expert like the Techs an U Haul but she knows what she needs ..I also had told them she would be waiting for the truck ... one hour install .. she waited 4hrs ...,billed 1 hour install.. because that's all it took.. so I get home after work and omg .. they put a well used 7 pin connector on the truck and drilled a hole through the step on the bumper to put one of the two required mounting bolts .. so the head of the bolt is under the bumper and there is 3/4" of bolt and nut sticking up through the bumper on the step ... so if you step on the "step" you get a bolt through your foot .. they're completely inept ..  go anywhere else these are not experts they're hacks.  No management or oversight ..  I should have canceled my appointment the first time they messed up my order.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

If I could give this company less that one star I would. We went numerous times during a two month period buying boxes and other packing supplies. So I had numerous receipts. When we went to return some unused boxes right before our move we were told that they could not take the return before “something else on the receipt had been returned”. What?? The woman couldn’t have cared less about this. After 2 hours on the phone, being shuffled from one person to another with corporate Uhaul we were issued a refund.
Go to HOME DEPOT, STAPLES, WALMART or anywhere else for packing supplies. We wouldn’t give Uhaul another cent. Also we used PENSKE for our truck rental because the prices were much much better.< /Text>

<rating>1</rating><Text>My friend had already been inside the office and discussed his need with staff.. I came to meet him and help purchase the rental.. staff knew he was waiting on me.. I arrived before closing time and we sat waiting while staff was busy with other clients. Closing time arrived. We sat waiting. 15 minutes later, the same employee that assisted my friend an hour earlier told us we were out of luck for renting a uhaul truck that day. WHAT??? We were inside before closing! We waited 30 min to be told NO! We waited patiently while other clients were helped and we are told 15 min after closing that there is no way a rental is going to happen today! Seriously! We could have been told when we walked in, we could have been told when the door was locked. This irresponsible employee should be fired for seemingly on purpose wasting our time, not renting to us and therfore ruining my friends plans for using the truck that day.</Text>< pics>

Reserved a 20' truck a week before coming in and they didn't have it at all. I spent 3 hours here waiting to see if they could have another truck ready, but customer service here does not care for you. I ended up having to go to another place to find a smaller truck. Again. If you are here to know how the service is, its complete garbage. Best this place can do is sell you boxes and tape, for trucks good luck. Your gonna be waiting HOURS.<//text>< pictures>

I could still here them and they helped everyone that was there first then they helped me. after 30 min wait. Guy was not helpful at all. I make my reservation and then calls back later telling me they were gonna have the trailer on a later time.

The general manager of this store is a horrible person to deal with. We had to wait 2 hours to pick up a trailer that we reserved days in advance and when the paperwork had to be filled out and there were questions he was argumentative and blamed everything on us when we were only asking questions and confused because the website doesn’t make things clear. I don’t know if Don Sheldon was having a bad day or has a bad life but he certainly takes it out on his customers.</text>

Serving the general public, especially on a moving day, is a job for a therapist.   Eva, who manages the U-Boxes went far beyond expectations, anticipated what I needed, having everything ready before I had the chance to ask.  Its a well oiled machine there.   Her colleagues are the same and I would hope U-Haul Corporate would consider this location as a training site.   I will definitely be using their services the next time.<//Review>

Spoken to rudely and he acts as if he's better than anyone. I asked his name he refused. Asked for managers card and was refused. Then ignored.
Worst experience in over 30 years of doing business with uhaul.

<text>The worst, most unnecessary and  illogical experience I’ve ever had with a place of business. I was repeatedly lied to, hung up on, ignored and treated terribly. The details are many and not worth reciting in this review, but to summarize I spent over 15 hours on the phone with U-Haul corporate, 5 hours in the location’s lot, sent 15 emails, and left innumerable voicemails all to gain access to boxes which we paid $2400 to ship across the country. The general manager Don Sheldon is doing a disservice to U-Haul and the community he operates in by mistreating customers and ignoring guidance from corporate and his superiors. Their poor reputation is throughly known by other U-Haul locations in Santa Rosa, U-Haul operations and others. Avoid this location at all costs. U-Haul, this location should be audited and Don should be removed from his post. You’ll find details in the four complaints I filed to U-Haul. To boot, employees are not wearing masks when they interact with customers.</text>< pics>

Terrible customer service. I called and apparently the reception was not good. The person on the other end yelled at me, hung up and then when I called back on a landline, picked up and hung up again. I get that technological problems are annoying but there’s no need to be rude. If I didn’t already have an order under way with things already shipped, I definitely would not choose this company.</Text>

<Review>The worst costumer service experience I’ve ever had in my entire life - to the extent that it seemed oddly personal. We were denied access to my Ubox - even after getting a notarized letter saying we could open and take it. We were lied to that there were no trailers - there was a perfectly functional one on display. We spent over 8 hours over the course of 3 days trying to get our stuff so we could move in and have a bed to sleep on. The woman at the counter was rude, passive aggressive, and flat out mean. She was literally texting another employee about me in front of me, which was obvious because the other employee wasn’t down with it and was trying to get her to say what she wanted aloud so I would also hear it. The manager, Don, should be fired - his unhelpfulness and aggression were disgusting for someone in a position of power. Finally - NOBODY WAS WEARING A MASK! We have immune compromised parents and now need to get tested due to all our interactions with them.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Been renting with them for years. This was super disappointing. Worst customer service I’ve ever received. And they didn’t do their job and call me ahead to confirm reservation. When I showed up the had me almost $100 over my phone quote and simply told me I can call corporate to figure it out. Not happy.< /Review>

If you can avoid this location, do it at all cost. If not, make sure they scan the returned equipment right in front of you. Otherwise, like others have said down below, they'll charge you for extra days/mileage/fuel. Don't let them get away with "just leave the keys in the vehicle and we'll take care of it".</Review>

I made a reservation for a trailer at this location, was told I could pick it up after 10am, showed up at 12:30: no trailer. They cancelled my reservation, gave the trailer to someone else and never even bothered to call me, email me, text me or communicate in any way. They basically screwed my entire moving. Very poor communication skills, and not honoring the reservation. They suck! Do not count on this for your moving day<//Text>

*Update*
Contacted by a corporate office who are in the process of resolving the situation. Added a few stars.
—
Everything was fine until my invoice was emailed to me the next day. There were 3 incorrect charges and multiple contacts to try and resolve. I was charged for things I didn’t rent... $10 for pads, $10 for a dolly and an extra day fee of $29.95 when I returned the truck at 7p the same day I rented it as agreed in my contract. This is highly suspicious. Disputing the $49.95 with my cc company. What a pain, never had an issue with U-Haul before, likely won’t use them again unless I can get my final receipt immediately on return, the guy at the lot was so busy I said emailing the receipt was fine.

I was happy with the front desk young woman that helped me. She was very nice. The tall, blonde gentleman that helped me hook up my trailer was also very kind and helpful. The only unfortunate thing was that one of the straps keeping my car secured to the trailer came loose on my first day of travel. I had to fix it when I noticed it was completely off the wheel the next morning. A young guy helped me with that particular wheel. He seemed a bit flustered. I'm glad everything was ok during my trip.</review>

All bad....no communication from them regarding my hitch install fiasco that I had to eventually just cancel along with my vehicle dolly reservation.  If they don't want my money that is fine, I will be happy to find someone who does. WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH THEM!! Recommend you find another location to help with your moving needs.<//Review>

Don is a complete jack off! I had reservations to get hitch and trailer, they rescheduled my hitch install for a week even though I was picking up a trailer the very next day for a cross country move. I explained I could not do it and was scheduled for that Friday even though I told them I was to be completely moved from my place by Friday. I ended up having to go to Oakland to get the hitch, Don explicitly stated he was sorry and he would make sure I got my trailer that night and he would be there until 8. I arrived at 7:40.. and it had been one hectic day due to this location. Don was standing inside the store at the register with the door locked and wouldn’t come over to the door at first, once he did he told me he already started counting his drawer and company policy states he can’t let me in now. I told him I don’t need to come in and if he could just take my card and let me be on my way that would be great... he began yelling at me saying he never told me I had until 8... if I could have reached through that glass and grabbed that inefficient, cocky SOB...  DO NOT USE THIS LOCATION!!!!!</Review>

The staff in the store were excellent representatives,

Very friendly Easy to work with and knowledgeable!

The reason I am giving a 4 star rating is that the truck was in terrible running condition!!!
We went 30 miles and it used over a half a tank of gas!!
The mirrors were stuck so it was impossible to drive safely.
The front seat had a Big hole in it and the seat was stuck so I was unable to adjust it!
Last but not least the Check Engine light came on!!!<//review>

<Rate>2</Rate><review>Probably the worst experience I have ever had at any business. I stopped by to buy a package of wrapping paper. The shelf price said it was $5.95, but when they rang it up on the computer they wanted to charge me $6.95. I said I wanted to get the shelf price because that is the price that was presented to me as a customer. Just like any other business would, but they said I'd have to pay what the computer said, and then I could open up a complaint with corporate customer service. I called customer service while I was at the store, and after 30 minutes, they finally got somebody in the store to give me the advertised price that was on the shelf. I know it's only a dollar, but if they could not use common sense for the benefit of the customer over a measly dollar, can you imagine what kind of problems you would have here, if say for example you brought a truck back one second past the time it was due, they would charge you for another day. Bottom line, you could be in a world of hurt if you ever rent something from this location. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one star is because corporate customer service came through and honored the price on the shelf.<//review>< pics>

Reserved a 15' box online, a uhaul rep even called to make sure that I would get the truck I need. My girlfriend and dad get there and no truck is available. They wait for 4 hours and try to rent us a van when a truck pulls in. By then our timeline was messed up so we decided to pick up the next day with my dad's card on file.  We pick up the truck(which only had a quarter tank) return it no issues, with my card on file and on my receipt. Next day, I get the receipt for 140, less than what was quoted, great I thought! But there's no charge on my card, my dad got charged the original quoted price of 160. This location is full of inept people who aren't properly trained or care. Avoid this location.<//review>

First off! the general manager likes to bully women!
Rents a truck with no license plate! My girl then gets harassed by the local sheriff's and when she calls it in to uhaul the general manager accuses her of stealing it off the truck!
He is rude! Pushy! And certainly over reacts to normal everyday situations!
And just because he has communication problems and lies. Promised to cover the gas for the inconvenience of having to return and switch trucks. Then reniggs on the deal and charges her for everything he has power to charge her for.
Well just be careful  doing business there! When less then a mile away you can rent from enterprise!</Text>

<text>So I was a bit skeptical to store my things at UHaul storage but so far I actually am very pleased. No hassling or un-easy feeling when sorting threw my things. Times are tough and they seem to understand that, as they are very understanding. Although the unit is a bit dark so I can you plan on spending some time going threw some of your things - make sure you have plenty of lanterns, lights, flash lights cause their hallway likes are motion detection and turn off if you are not moving up and down the hall.</text>< Pics>

I wish there were a way in providing a rating to differentiate between the specific staff at a location of a corporation and the corporation itself. The people at this specific store are very friendly, helpful, and accommodating. The storage space for U-boxes as well as the retail space are clean and adequate. The basic U-Haul equipment provided by them, including packing materials and vehicles, is satisfactory and nicely varied. But if you ever want to get them on the phone, forget it. The location on Santa Rosa Ave is also in a neighborhood where you have to be mindful of the possibility of theft, which complicates accessing anything in storage there. (Staff discourage you from leaving anything in your car, and are rightfully disinclined to leave U-boxes out in the yard for easier access. .. and since you can't reach them by phone to negotiate timing, it's complicated.)

But most of all, if I could give negative stars for the customer service provided by U-Haul as a company, I would. If you're looking for a moving solution, save yourself a whole slew of headaches, hassle, and misinformation, and go elsewhere.</Review>

Jullee is great at customer service. I had to go there several times to get more boxes before our big move. Every Time I went in Jullee made me feel like I was her only customer. I will miss going there. Thank you U-Haul.</Text>

<Review>Would give 0 stars if I could. Ubox experience is horrible.  Getting to your ubox after renting is awful.  Can't talk with the store most of the time as goes to the call center.  The call center tries to help but then local says ubox person doesnt work sunday or monday and starts at 9am.  Don laughs at you and is hostile when you try to work things out.  Never use them!!!</Review>< response>

I reserved a furniture dolly with the truck and when I got there they didn't have it. Didn't even apologized. And then they gave me a truck that didn't have AC working, knowing that I had a 10 hour drive trip in the middle of summer temperature of 100 degrees. Then the truck lost power and I didn't even make it all the way to my destination!!! Oh, it also had a nail on the tire before leaving the UHAUL (this is the one on Santa Rosa Avenue, Santa Rosa CA). Instead of having somebody come out and fix the tire, they made me drive to the tire shop. And giving me a different truck was not an option!!!< /text>

Service is not very good here. We order a truck. And they did not have it. 6 months ago rented. A trailer from u haul we could not returned here they sent us two hours away. They were going to give us a 70.00 discount by returning it further away and they never gave us are discount.< /review>

Used U-Haul to get a ubox and fill it /ship it. Very friendly and efficient. Hooked us up and unhooked in a jiffy.

Best U-Haul location! Have lots of boxes and hitches too.< /review>

<Text>These people are the sweetest! Although I spent an hour waiting in line, it was because of the attendants patience and service with this older couple who literally had a question about EVERYTHING. And though the line continued to grow, they were very conscious of it as well as the couple. The gentlemen never displayed that all the questions and all the time the couple were taking up, was as frustrating for them as it was for the line.</Text><rate>5<//rate></record>

We had a tow hitch installed on our Toyota Sienna. While doing the electrical connections, they remounted our tail-light incorrectly and broke the bracket.

We rented a small sport trailer for a trip to Yellowstone. Upon picking the trailer up, we complained about the bald tires. Bald as in no tread whatsoever. Jim Coffee said he'd feel comfortable driving from Northern California to Texas on those tires.

Now, my family and I are stranded 60 miles from the nearest town in the middle of Nevada on the side of Interstate 80 with semis passing at high speed. The tires didn't even make it 300 miles. Jim Coffee put my family in danger and I will never use U-Haul again.<//text>

I had a trailer electric brake unit that I purchased there and have had to go back three times.  I finely went to Hahn Auto in Santa Rosa on Dutton and was told that not only was the in-and-out conto unit installed upside down which would affect it's operation, but the wiring was installed badly.<//review>

My husband let the representative know that it was her, the very same clerk, that he had spoken to on the phone, as he remembered her name and they way she continually called him "sweetie."

A busy small location that in my experience was ok until I returned the trailer I rented and was told by one of their yard guys to leave it in the spot he said to leave it in .  Three days later I was called  and asked when I was bringing it back.  I left my tie downs in the trailer the day before and had gone back the next day to get them and it was back in its original rental spot but still got the call 3 days later I hadn't returned it. Not sure what the check in and out process is here but sounds like it could use a little double checking in.< /Review>

<review>U Haul.  If it can go wrong it will.  It's not personal, its just pretty common. No one can solve the problem because its never any ones fault.  Local or National it's always someone else.  Main thing for me THIS TIME was I ordered $500 worth of boxes on line, got my confirmation, followed up by an "its ready to pick up"confirmation email.  I went to the the Santa Rosa store and...they sold them to someone else.  None of the other stores had boxes either.  Boxes!?  Why would they sell my boxes I already paid for?
This meant on moving day (not a day you like to get surprises from u haul or anyone else on)  I got to do down to the FedEx place (rather then working on moving) and pay emergency rates for boxes so I could move.  Thanks a bunch for leaving me high and dry, cost me extra money, and making a traditionally stressful day even more unpleasant.   Oh, and good luck posting a review online on their website.  I have my contract number but that didn't work to post my experience.  If that is a regular practice I imagine their review ratings are quite inflated.  Very disappointed.< /review>< pics>

They called 2 days before pickup to say that they didn't have any more 20' trucks. Ok, fine. I asked what they have that's comparable. They told me they had a 15' truck and will add on a 6' x 12' trailer for the same price. That'll work. I show up at the uhaul store to pick up. There is one person behind the counter, and 5-6 peopke in the yard working on trucks. The woman at the counter asks for my info, which I give, and she immediately goes to help the next customer in line without doing anything for me. She comes back after about 10 minutes of helping another customer, calls me by the wrong name, and proceeds to tell me that they don't have a truck or trailer available for me. I ask how this can happen and she responds: "we overbooked". Note that they have at least 5 15' trucks and several trailers in the yard. Absolutely ridiculous. No attempt to correct the 2 mistakes they've made. I ended up having to drive to Windsor to get a truck and larkfield to get a trailer. Will never use this company again.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

Was double charged for my trailer at this location, after emailing proof of my bank statements with duplicate charges for the same amount charged 3 days apart, they won't contact me back. Wouldn't recomend this place to anyone.<//text>

< review>
Alot of verifications and questions to awnser , Just to get a price on a trailer... Go somewhere else.... Very unprofessional... Once i am there, questions are fine.. But im on a phone... What does The truck i am driving have to do with the price of a day rental?   Nothing... Nor my name and number, unless im reserving it, right. Why ask alot of questions , BEFOR i even know if im a customer.... Alot of crap.< /review>

<Text>I made an appointment to have a trailer hitch installed. A week later when it was supposed to be installed I was advised the day I arrived it would be two days later.  Then I was told two days later they had the wrong hitch.  I will never ever go back to this Uhaul in Santa Rosa.  The staff was rude and basically stupid.<//Text><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x808449d9afcd1423:0xc6505783874690d1<//gmap_id><pics>None</pics><Rate>1</Rate><Date>1539867702122<//Date>< Name>

<review>Not friendly/considerate employees.

I think we’re all used to seeing the call button being broken, no big deal I can walk up to the building. it’s a bit annoying however to make the walk and then be told “it ain’t gonna happen man” when I ask about getting propane filled. Evidently it was only the guy manning the counter and another guy. I gave the suggestion that they could add a note at the propane fill about not filling propane and I got a dirty stare as though that was way too much to ask. Constrained criticism is that he could be said that it may take a bit to get to me since they were short staffed and not flat flat out denying me service.

To be fair, when I was entering the store he was on the phone phone with a lady and seemed a tad nicer saying why he couldn’t go look for whatever it was she called about.</review>< username>

<review>Adrain, dental hygienist, is consistently meticulous cleaning my teeth. He generously makes suggestions to me for improving my daily brushing. As a team, we are keeping my teeth healthy. Also, the staff is very professional. Finally, Dr Perlaza is the very best dentist of my 81 years of experience.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

I really despise going to the dentist in general but Adrien, the dental hygienist I see has made it a way better experience. He's very knowledgeable, kind, and funny. Dr. Perlaza is also great. He's quick, efficient, honest, and knows what he's doing.  I highly recommend  Sherman Oaks Dentistry!< /text>< pics>

This place is amazing! Dr. Perlaza explained all of my options thoroughly, and made sure I was completely comfortable with the possibilities. His reassurances were incredibly relaxing, and for the first time in many years, I do not dread going back to the dentist. They are great!</Review>

Everyone was so welcoming and nice. Dr Perlaza did a great job on my two crowns and they look super real. The whole process was smooth although my two temporary crowns fell off while I was waiting for my real crowns. However, everyone made me feel good!
I also went there for a cleaning and Adrien was the best dental hygienist I ever had. No pain and his positive attitude really made my day. I will always ask for him to be my hygienist. That mean said I highly recommend him!
Also all the people at the front desk were amazing. I just forgot their names. No wait time, all my appointments were on time, on the dot!
Thank you all for your professionalism and positive attitude!</text>

I have not been to the dentist for over 9 years because I hate it! My sister highly recommended this dental practice so I thought I would give it a try. I felt comfortable immediately, all of the staff has been amazing! I have since had a root canal, fillings and a crown. I had very little pain following the procedure and no longer feel anxious about dental work. Highly recommend!< /Review>

The dental hygienist who took my X-rays and photos was very pleasant and kept informing me of what she was doing, which I hugely appreciated, and she was sensitive to the pain I was experiencing. Dr. Perlaza took his time to show me my photos, point things out, and explain next steps in a clear way.

Afterward, Crystal, a receptionist, went over what Dr. Perlaza recommended treatment-wise, but in no way pressured me into a decision.

Definitely very happy that I went to this office!</review>< userid>

Everyone was very pleasant and kind. Crystal was very professional and fast to set me up, and the dr took plenty of time to answer all of my questions and explain things very thoroughly and in simple language so I could understand. Very thankful I found this group.</Review>

I was seen right on time and did not spend too long waiting for the Dr. it seems like they know how to schedule without overloading. Most other dentist I’ve been to always leave you waiting a long time. That hasn’t happened here and I have been twice so far.
I would definitely recommend this office.</review>< resp>

Staff, clinicians, and doctor were all very understanding and patient with me. I have a strong gag reflex and they were able to work around that with new equipment and technique. I’m usually afraid of going to the dentist but feel at home here.< /Text>

< Review>
I moved last year and needed to find a new dentist. My old dentist actually recommended Sherman Oaks Dentistry and I’m so glad he did! Dr. Peralza is very knowledgeable and attentive. Also, the hygienists and staff are always very friendly and thorough. In addition, they have taken so many precautions to make sure your safety isn’t in jeopardy in regards to the coronavirus. I highly recommend this office for your dental needs!</Review>

I needed a new dentist in the area and I’m glad I found this office. Everyone is very friendly! Dr. Perlaza is so personable and welcoming. Most importantly, I can tell he’s very honest with his exams. It’s a relief I won’t have to worry if what he’s recommending is actually truthful. Very happy with my first experience and I’d recommend this office.</text>

Dr. Perlaza and his staff are the best! I am so happy I switched my care over to him. Upon completion of my exam, he walked me through my results and explained the kind of care I would need - regular cleanings twice a year! My last dentist was charging for me a lot of extra stuff that it turns out I didn’t need. If you’re looking for an honest and friendly dentist, I suggest you see Dr. Perlaza!< /Review>

This office is excellent. In my 40+ years of having teeth and having dentists in cities I've lived in both in Los Angeles and on the East Coast I have never felt more comfortable and happy than I am with Dr. Perlaza and his staff. You would never know it until you actually experience the professional care this office provides. The initial exam was quite eye opening to say the least. No pushy sales, just the truth about what I should get done. In my situation I needed a lot of work done but we spread it out over 12 months. Its been 1 year i've been Dr. P's patient and I not only consider him as my dentist but also my friend. He's really a great guy and so is the entire staff.<//Text>

Dr. Perlaza gave the most complete and straight forward diagnosis I have ever had. I went to a different dentist right before Dr. Perlaza who shamed me and kept insisting I had heart disease and diabetes and I have perfect health. I was nervous going to a new dentist but Dr. Perlaza came highly recommended and I will be recommending him. He has the nicest manner as well as knowledge and his staff is also incredible, efficient and helped me feel comfortable immediately.< /Review>

This was my first visit to this office.  The care was amazing and the doctor was so thorough.  I was really impressed with the cleanliness of the office.  He has TV's which are great for distraction. I got a very clear path given to me of what I need to do.  He seemed very conservative in his treatment and in no rush to do anything unneeded. I was grateful for that. From what he said I was right about my previous dentist.  He was nice but did not do a great job. I want someone who listens and does a great job and I believe I will receive that here.< /text>

Such a wonderful and comfortable experience--everyone who worked with me took time to explain what they were doing, and then more time to explain x-ray interpretations. Nothing was rushed, and all of my questions were thoughtfully answered. I'll be looking forward to my next appointment in six months! Thank you, Dr. Perlaza and staff!<//Text>

<review>I've been there three times so far and the comfort level went from "newbie" to "darn near family" within seconds. Never mind that my teeth are clean and I feel great; and we haven't even talked about the amazing photography on the walls; the entire team makes you feel like you matter.  UPDATE OCTOBER 2020: I've been there far more than three times by now. I bet you don't have fun going to your dentist's office. I do. I hope they do, too, when I visit.</review><Date>1602180673126</Date><Pics>None<//Pics><userid>112978290581367090680</userid>< resp>

<text>This dentistry was probably the most inviting, clean and caring place I have ever been to. Right when I walked into the door I received a feeling of welcome. Once I was taken to the back, the girls and the doctor were very gentle. I was even told that I would feel some pain when given novocaine and didn't feel anything. Great place to go and get your teeth cared for.</text>< Pics>

My experience was fantastic! I was nervous about going to the dentist alone for the first time and everyone was extremely nice and welcoming. I really wish I could continue coming to this dentist but because I am 22 years old and kinda broke I have to choose a dentist that takes my Gold insurance discount. I'm very disappointed though because I genuinely enjoyed Dr. Perlaza examining me and his communicative nature.< /text>

As a lifetime sugar addict, I have made countless visits to many dentists from Newport Beach to Los Angeles for more than 50 years. Sherman Oaks Dentistry and Dr. Perlaza gave me exceptional first impressions (no pun intended). The receptionist, office manager, and dental assistant were all extremely courteous, friendly and fabulously efficient. We all know the support staff is just as important as the dentist since a badly run office can be maddening when they mix up your appointment or files or keep you waiting for 45 minutes or send you a surprise bill for hundreds of dollars. The great office staff had my costs ready by the time I asked since they checked my insurance right after I made my appointment. Dental costs are another huge concern for all of us today. I had xrays, photos and an exam for a $21.80 co-pay...from a PPO cosmetic/implant/general dentist in Sherman Oaks!!! I asked Dr. Perlaza to check a bonding problem from a previous cosmetic dentist. He not only listened, he did exactly what I requested. The staff had my estimate before I asked: a co-pay of $50.80 out of a $254 cost. The last two or three dentists I went to with only one problem didn't bother listening to why I was there and gave me estimates for anything they could think of up to a total of $3,000 (exactly double what my insurance would cover since they knew my co-pay was 50% then). Shocking dental cost estimates have been the topic of many lunches with former co-workers and now co-retirees who are all just trying to make ends meet. One co-worker with a wife and 3 kids who answered a "free exam and xrays" coupon got a "family deal" estimate for $10,000!!! Seriously! Most dentists today not only have DDS after their names, they also have the big $$$ items "cosmetic dentistry and implants" listed after their names. Which brings me to the most important member of the team, Dr. Perlaza. He also has "general dentistry" after his name. He is the real deal! After listening to all my other concerns, he examined all my teeth, xrays  and photos. He clearly explained everything in detail (he teaches at UCLA) without being condescending. He tactfully explained why "a Hollywood Smile with veneers" would be a waste of money for me since I have severe problems with receeding bone and gums which will just get worse with age. He did not try to sell me anything like the last three dentists. More importantly, he took the time to answer all my questions and discuss options. He also suggested I Google some options without someone trying to sell me anything. However, the coolest thing is he is a scuba diver who does underwater photography. While you are getting a dental procedure you won't even think about it.....since you can watch a video of him deep in the ocean in a shark cage surrounded by sharks. Dr. Perlaza is the one with the camera,  NOT one of the blood thirsty sharks (pun intended). I think I need to refer my former co-worker with the 3 kids to him. They need a real dentist like Dr Perlaza. So do I for the next 30 years.</text>

<review>I came in because of an infected tooth, was given antibiotics and will need to follow up getting my remaining dental issues taken care of. Crystal gave me a tour of the office and I met with Dr Perlaza in a consultation room before getting x-rays and an exam by him. Everything about this office is top notch and professional. The staff is fantastic. Since then, my daughter, son in law, and three year old grandson have gone. (He points out "the dentist" office every time we drive by now). We've definitely found our family dental office for years to come.</review><Resp>None<//Resp><UserId.>116727283194268776766</UserId.><time>1474825353038</time></record>

<review>I am a fairly new patient at the office and I LOVE it, the doctor is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G, he is gentle and I trust him. This is the first dental office that I went to where they were not trying to Sell me dentistry, instead he Educated me and helped me to avoid pain. I would recommend him to anyone, every chance I get, he is the number 1 dentist
I refer. So if you are reading this that means your looking, well look no further because this is where you want to be. TRUST ME</review><UserId.>114798847025267513492</UserId.>< gmapID>

<review>Doctors see many patients in a day, not to mention many patients at the same time of the day. Dr. Perlaza gave me his full and undivided attention during our consultation and when he was discussing my exams. He was also very efficient when he repaired a large cavity for me that had previously been filled. All in all a great dental experience, makes me excited for my next cleaning!< /review>< Pictures>

Dr. Perlaza and his staff came enthusiastically recommended by not one...not two...but THREE of my colleagues! From the minute I walked in, I felt like a welcome guest. The entire staff is, across the board, friendly, patient, gentle, and professional. A truly first-rate experience-- and I say this as someone who would generally rather set my head on fire than go to the dentist! No pain or anxiety anymore!< /Text>

Everyone in the office was so friendly and I loved that they explained everything they were doing every step of the way, even though it was just a pretty routine cleaning, exam, and x-rays. It was a joy to meet Dr. Perlaza and the rest of the staff!<//review>

Although going to the dentist is one of my least favorite things, Dr. Perlaza and his staff make it a pleasant experience. Everyone in the office is friendly and professional, and watching videos from Dr. P's incredible vacations during my cleanings are always a fun little escape from reality.< /Text>

I'm so glad I found Dr. Perlaza's offices when we moved into the area. It's hard to say who amongst all of the employees is best because everybody is so welcoming. Dr. Perlaza himself is awesome and it's always great to hear about his adventures he's been on. I meet Paola for all of my appointments and she's amazing! I never thought I would say this, but I actually enjoy going to the dentist!!!</review>

I was recently referred to Dr. Perlaza from a friend of mine. I felt comfortable there right away- they make sure to take their time with you- not rushing you out (on your first visit they take you on a tour, sit you down in a private room to meet with Dr. Perlaza, etc.). The entire staff is super friendly and always asking if you're comfortable or need anything. They have movies you can while getting dental work done- or you can watch Dr. Perlaza's videos of his own travels! Overall I have had a great experience here and would definately recommend to anyone who needs a dentist!</text>

I was referred to Dr. Perlaza because my boyfriend also had a great experience here. I needed a new dentist closer to home, and was also thrilled that this office offers services on Saturdays, if you book far enough in advance.

Everyone was so friendly, and the first time I arrived I was given a tour as if I were a guest at someone’s home.

My procedures (just cleaning and a couple fillings) were fine; Dr. and his assistant (whose name has slipped my mind – sorry!) were very gentle, took their time, and checked in on me to see how I was feeling.

Scheduling my next appointment was really easy too, even though my schedule made it challenging.

And yeah – gorgeous photography on the walls (I’m a photographer myself), and the vast library of all kinds of movies to watch while they work on you and Dr. Perlaza’s travel videos made my procedure fly by.

I’ve already suggested his office to a colleague of mine who isn’t thrilled with their dentist. Would definitely recommend :)< /review>

Great experience! Authentic, friendly, caring staff give off a small-town family business vibe with all the conveniences of modern dentistry--including seeing photos and xrays of your teeth on the monitor as Dr. Perlaza walks you through your examination. Their online game is on point, best healthcare business website I've ever used for filling out forms and getting information. The atmosphere is great, everyone is excellent at encouraging healthy dental habits without making you feel guilty for admitting you never floss as much as you know you should. And convenient (albeit not free) parking structure right by the building! Would recommend to anyone.</text>

<Review>I went to see Dr. Perlaza for a fifth opinion regarding a dental issue I was having. I was told I had horrible gum recession and needed gum grafting. After seeing other specialists, Dr. Perlaza was the only honest professional who told me that I do not need the procedure, and instead told me how I can prevent further issues with my gums. Most professionals in the dental field are only concerned about money and acquiring patients. May I also add that this office has the most welcoming staff ever! I personally met everyone in the office during my first visit. The only downside are the prices, but you get what you pay for. I will gladly pay higher prices for great and honest work!<//Review>< Pics>

< review>
15 years ago, when my wife was a patient of Dr. Perlaza and I wasn't, I had excruciating tooth pain on a Sunday. Dr. Perlaza, on his day off, agreed to meet me at his office to perform an emergency root canal. Suffice it to say that I was extremely grateful for the courtesy and became a loyal patient.

Over the years, Dr. Perlaza continued to prove that he is an excellent dentist. He runs his practice with great efficiency. His advice and recommendations are always honest and not embellished. I love his office's set up which is state of the art and soothing. For any procedure, there is a TV screen overhead. For longer procedures, there is a menu of films to watch. Fortunately (or unfortunately) I once got to see one of those films from beginning to end, which kept my mind occupied. :)

The most important thing is that Dr. Perlaza has a soft touch with everything he does. Even the anesthesia shots don't hurt! After getting to know Dr. Perlaza's soft touch, I was never apprehensive again about going to him for any scheduled procedure and I always trusted that I would walk out of his office painlessly.

I moved out of the area a couple of months ago and doubt I will ever find another dentist of Dr. Perlaza's caliber. Too bad, so sad.< /review>

<Text>Dr. Perlaza and his team are fantastic! My wife I have been going to him for almost two years now. When you walk in you are immediately greeted by the ladies at the front desk. They are all super friendly and nice. The waiting room has water and coffee for you. I have never waited for more then 5 minutes. Once you are in your chair they offer a Movie to watch while you wait for the dr. The office is super clean and decked out with beautiful photographs Dr. Perlaza took around the world. Overall a great place. I would highly recommend Dr. Peralaza and his team!<//Text>< pics>

<Review>Had to have our water heater removed then re-installed in order to replace flooring. Our technical, Brandon, did a great job! Even came back on a Sunday! Very professional and friendly. He went above and beyond by connecting our washer and dryer as well. Customer service and dispatch were top notch. Our family has hired Bill Howe for multiple properties, for years, and we are always very happy! Thankful to have them.<//Review><time>1621188214252<//time><Gmap_id>0x80dbffd6a74d24ed:0xd95f60f86694dfb9</Gmap_id>< resp>

Bill Howe gives first-rate service - and is staffed with skilled technicians.
The team has a can-do approach to diverse plumbing requests.  I needed to have my GroheBlue Chilled and Sparkling water filtration system removed and reinstalled for a cabinet repair and Steven W. was the best person for the job.  I trust this organization - they are my go-to service provider.</review>

The Bill Howe Technician was excellent! He came out twice to help find the leak. All initial estimates and advice were no charge.

When it came to making the repair, the Plumbing technician came on time and did a great job - very professionally done! He explained what he was doing and why along the way during the repair and came in under the estimate.

There would be 5 stars given the quality of work, friendliness, and professionalism of the plumbing technician. However, I gave 4 stars because the Bill Howe price estimating and billing process is somewhat opaque. You get a total price estimate and number of hours expected to be charged - nothing for materials, just a total price. When the job was completed an hour under the hours estimate, the price came to only $100 less than the  estimate - and still no materials itemization on the price.

I think the price was mostly fair as near as I can tell given the up front work not charged. I would use Bill Howe again no doubt. But next time, I will ask for a better explanation of the estimate and the final price.</text>< pictures>

<rating>5< /rating><review>We hadn’t had any of our plumbing problems fixed in 2020 - we wanted to wait until we felt it was safe to do so. I had an estimate from another plumber that was higher, the work suggested would have been more invasive, I was asked to buy parts, and it was hard to understand him. Another plumbing company charged just for coming over to do an estimate. My neighbor uses Bill Howe so I thought a free estimate would be worth a try. Tom who did the original estimate was very reassuring that a cartridge replacement for our shower didn’t require cutting drywall, the leak under one sink was simple, as well as the other repairs. Juan was very professional, explained everything and was very good about asking questions. In the end he actually drove to Chula Vista to get a part so that we wouldn’t have to be without water/a shower. He had the other replacement parts, and although it took twice as long (not his fault), everything works beautifully and I will call Bill Howe next time for plumbing problems.<//review>< pics>

Had Dave Redfield from Bill Howe install a new hot water heater for us and on a scale of 1 to 10 - we give Dave a 12!!  Installation was in a difficult place and with zero grumbling and a total positive attitude, Dave and an assistant (sorry, forgotten the assistant’s name, but he was equally positive) went to work.  Polite, professional & very caring, the installation corrected shortcomings of the previous installation (which was done 11 years prior by a different company).   And all done at a fair and good value price.  Can’t recommend more highly.< /text>

I made a service call with Bill Howe to have a faucet and garbage disposal replaced. The plumbing tech that came and took care of the job was Juan. He was very professional and friendly. Juan took care of the installation of the faucet and disposal. He also made recommendations in regard to replacing the shut off valves (which had obvious mineral build up and didn’t move), and a worn water supply hose to the dishwasher. I was grateful that he was able to take care of these extra items. The service call was a very positive experience!! My husband and I had used Bill Howe in the past, so I was confident in having them work on our house again. Great techs and company!!</review>

Far too often when you write an evaluation of an organization it’s usually because they are not that good. This time I get the opportunity to write an evaluation on the company that I plan on continuing to use because their exceptional service and follow-up. During the start of the pandemic our heat and air-conditioning system went out. We contacted Bill Howe Plumbing Heating and Air-conditioning and had an estimate for the replacement of the system within a week. The system that they installed surpassed our expectations, was completed on time, corrected all the issues we had and included an exceptional warranty. This was all done at a price below what we expected. I highly recommend this company because of their attention to detail, quality products, knowledgeable employees, integrity and follow-up services. They are truly a customer service oriented company.

William did an excellent job in installing a new water heater.  After discussing the job, William immediately started with the installation and within one hour and completed the task. He gave me instructions on how to change the settings and answered all of my questions in a professional manner.  Before leaving he cleaned up the entire area and left it very clean.  He was very professional throughout the installation, and I recommend Bill Howe plumbing for any services. This is the second time I have used them and have been very pleased with the price and the service.</text>

In the event that any occur, a change order and a new contract price will be provided.

<text>Scott was great. He arrived on time, diagnosed the problem with the toilet quickly and was able to repair it. He was friendly and personable, explained things well, and gave me tips on preventative maintenance. Also, he charged me a fair, reasonable price. I could not have been more satisfied with the service he provided.</text></record></dataset><record>

Anthony was on time each day. He replaced our downstairs toilet and cleaned up the tile flooring. Anthony communicated with us and asked for our suggestions about what toilet we preferred. Removal, installation and cleanup was quick and quiet.

We are very happy with Anthony’s work and respect to customer and with Bill Howe Plumbing.

<review>Outstanding customer service experience from Bill Howe Plumbing.
From scheduling service to appointment day I couldn't be more pleased.
My technician Ignacio P. was great !  He arrived promptly on time and was ready to go. He was very efficient, courteous and professional. He explained what was needed to be done and quickly located the leaking pipe in my ceiling which put my mind to ease. The work area was protected and all debris removed afterwards.
I highly recommend Ignacio and Bill Howe Plumbing !

I used Bill Howe on a Sunday and had a great experience. I called Saturday night for an issue with a water heater. On Sunday Corey was dispatched to the rental to fix the water heater. His communication throughout the entire appointment was appreciated since I was not on site. He was professional, polite personable and had great customer service before and after the appointment. I highly recommend Bill Howe. They are super professional, honest and all around nice. This is my third time working with them within a week on separate properties. Thank you again Corey for being so great and getting the problem solved today.</Review>

I was very happy with the technician crew sent. Very professional and courteous men that put a lot of effort into doing the job right. My experience with this project was exceptional. I had 4 different plumbers offer estimates. I received the best diagnosis and repair plain from Bill Howe’s team.<//Review>

Bill Howe Plumbing sent out Troy, an outstanding plumbing technician to our apartment building today. He was very thorough and professional. He sent a text when on the way and upon completion. Plus called after to give complete run down of work performed and billing charges. Troy also checked ALL drains in the apartment instead of just the clogged tub. Many plumbing companies do the bare minimum and charge exorbitant fees only to come right back again and charge more. Bill Howe seems to always do it right the 1st time! Never a surprise or shock when billing is received from Bill Howe Plumbing, as our current main plumbing company has done to us before. I have used Bill Howe for most of our plumbing issues since the beginning of 2021 and have not had issues with their work OR charges being high to date. I have been blessed with working with 3 other Bill Howe plumbing technicians and all too have done outstanding work as well. Even after hour emergency fees have been fair compaired to many other plumbing companies we have under contract. Bill Howe Plumbing hs always been reasonable and fair on billing and we believe It is mainly because of the integrity of their plumber technicians. Bill Howe Heating & Air Conditioning Restoration & Flood Services Inc may NOW be 1st on our list going forward after the excellent service today. Unfortunately our buildings had plumbing issues before Bill Howe Plumbing started helping us. Now that we have them on our team the issues seem to be decreasing because of their quality of work!</text>

All aspect of services were great, from service reps to plumber. I did receive conflicting info between 3 different employees:
1) Two employees told me there is a flat rate of $82 to unplug a bathtub drain. One phone rep quoted $82-174 for same service.
2) One phone rep told me downstairs neighbors would have to be contacted in advance to coordinate appointment so their plumber could check their pipes are OK after completing service in my place.
But when Shaun arrived to conduct free estimate, he said he could unplug drain immediately and would check with downstairs neighbors After he unplugged drain. I assume, then, that’s normal procedure, Not what I was told over the phone.</Review>

<Text>I highly recommend Chris Sullivan, a plumber with Bill Howe Plumbing. He did a great job replacing my garbage disposal and unclogging a drain in my bathroom. In addition to being a knowledgable and efficient plumber, he is just a really nice guy. Truly a kind, honest and intelligent human being.

A neighbor recommended Bill Howe after Chris fixed her kitchen drain, and I'm so glad I listened to her. I often feel anxiety about having a stranger come into my home to fix stuff, especially during the pandemic, but I felt very comfortable with Chris within a minute of talking to him. He's also very neat and clean. He wore a mask, gloves, and coverings over his shoes, which is very important to me. If you need a plumber, look no further: call Bill Howe and ask for Chris!<//Text>< Pictures>

Technician did a fast,efficient job since he explained the problem we were experiencing with our water heater.  Last year by this same time we had similar problem and the Technician from another company who did the inspection requested the part which was under guarantee but he never called back. We ended up calling another company and that part was not needed to be replaced but the problem was solved.  The thermostat part which was not used saved us time  from having to request it. It replaced the old one and we were able to have hot water again. Very satisfied with the service, 100% recommended.</text>

Bill Howe's team did a complete re-pipe and sewer lining for our 60+ yr old house in Serra Mesa.   The work was first rate, done very quickly and was thousands less than our other quotes.   Still not in inexpensive job, but having a top tier professional company to back up their work was the most important thing to us.  We are completely satisfied!   Miguel, Kevon and JR were extremely professional, and answered all our questions.  Great technicians, nice guys and we highly recommend them and the entire Bill Howe team.</text>

Gabriel was very professional!  I just hated having to pay the service fee when Bill Howe was the ones who put our new faucets (6) in just 1 1/2 years ago. I’ve never had my entire faucets come loose before, much less 2 of them! Oh well, at least he was nice about it...but $174.00, 😫< /review>

I had a new water heater installed, kitchen faucet installed, three bathroom faucets installed and a drain cleared all by Bill Howe Plumbing. Every experience was a good one from the professionalism of the techs to the timely service they provided. The quality of their work was very impressive and the follow up from the home office shows the company is committed to a very high level of customer satisfaction.

I would highly recommend Bill Howe to anyone with whatever plumbing needs they may have.</Review>

<Text>I have used Bill Howe for my plumbing and air conditioning needs as of late. They have done an excellent job each time they visited my property for service needs. Recently Nicholas Walker came to inspect our AC unit. He was personable, prompt, and very communicative about what needed to be done with our HVAC unit. He took his time during the inspection and was professional and courteous throughout our interaction. I would highly recommend Bill Howe to friends and family and will be requesting Nicholas should when we need a new HVAC in the future.</Text>< date>

Bill Howe encourages their employees to take their commercial trucks home and park them in private neighborhoods- whether they live there or not. The problem then lies with the inhabitants of these neighborhoods, as there is no where to park in an already congested area. The issue isn't whether it's legal- the issue is that it's not fair. Our neighborhood is upset because we already have trouble finding parking. I called Bill Howe to try to resolve the issue after seeing two of their employees park their trucks and leave in their smaller vehicles to go home. Their associate on the phone had no intention to resolve anything, was incredibly rude and even went as far as to insinuate that I was responsible for the vandalism that has been done to their trucks. It was very disappointing, as a native San Diegan, to discover that this is NOT a local San Diego family-owned company that values basic common courtesy, positive community relations, or meaningful conversations around conflict resolution- so much for "we know Howe"!!

I definitely "know Howe" to hire another company  for my plumbing, heating/air conditioning needs that actually CARES about the communities within our finest city.<//Review>

{'time': 1620521659087, 'text': "Thank you very much for letting us know this, Ashley.  We certainly do not want to upset anyone based on where we park our vehicles.  Our technicians do bring their vehicles home with them at night, which makes it easier to serve our customers early in the morning and late in the evening, and sometimes their HOAs won't let them park in front of their homes.  We do care very much about the communities and people of San Diego.  We will look for alternative parking places in the future.  Thanks again for bringing this to our attention."}< /response>

I live in a large, older apartment complex.  Many trees and shrubs.  Roots penetrate water and sewer lines and caused a huge problem for me. Bill Howe Plumbing sent out a very competent, professional gentleman named Chris. He and two others from Bill Howe worked hard for several hours to resolve the problem, which was complicated by previous poor work done by others over the years.  Repairs were made and past mistakes corrected. These fellows worked efficiently and were professional, meticulous and pleasant.  As a elderly person, I appreciated the extra consideration and kindness they showed. Very respectful.  Thank you Bill Howe.< /text>

Jojo and the other three technicians arrived promptly and were well-equipped for the work. They showed much ingenuity for the installation in that they had to remove and replace equipment on the rooftop. They were very careful about floors and walls and set down weighted tarps so as not to bring dirt and moisture into the house. I really appreciate their friendly and professional attitudes throughout.</Review>

A sump pump in a basement toilet had been had been  malfunctioning and giving off odors indicating possible leakage. But there was not an obvious leak and the pump/tank through a cabinet to a vault below the floor. Bill Howe team members were very careful to assess the problem and explain exactly what was needed. They were very careful to minimize the need to alter the cabinetry to install the new equipment. I really appreciated their focus on getting things exactly right rather than rushing just to get done. I’ll be calling Bill Howe for any future plumbing needs.< /Text>

I've used Bill Howe for my condo rental for over ten years for the unfortunate collective issues that have occurred for the entire time. Every time, they've been professional and polite, and very efficient in their work. Any issues are not repeated issues, my home just has crummy pipes.

Tonight, 03.17.2021, Matthew Revels was our technician. He gave us our options for the after-hours  service and helped temporarily alleviate the issue until we can address it during non-emergency hours. He also provided the bid for the necessary work to hopefully be completed within the next week. Thanks!<//Text>

<Review>Plumbing problems are never fun and seem to happen at the most inconvenient times. We were fortunate to have Louie and Roberto come to our rescue.  Louie was a pleasure to work with, very responsive, and ready to answer any and all questions.  Next time we are in need, we will ask for him.  He clearly explained what our problems were and the associated costs for the repairs.  Louie was professional and represented Bill Howe well.   Roberto and his apprentice were hard workers.  They came prepared and ready to get to work.  When they were surprised to find 12 inches of concrete instead of the expected 4, long hours were required to make sure we had water back before they left.  Although that extended the job, Roberto went above and beyond to finish as soon as possible. We appreciated that so much.</Review>< Name>

I had used Bill Howe years ago, and decided to call them.  I provided my info and received a call from the on call plumber just a few minutes later.  Justin Gould arrived at the house within 15 minutes.  He was professional, enthusiastic, and extremely helpful.  He cleared the blockage with 15 minutes.  The cost was reasonable, and I highly recommend Bill Howe Plumbing.</Text>< pictures>

Clarence Davis was very professional and at the same time very personable in his handling of our plumbing issue. He told us what the problem was and what he was going to do to resolve it and the cost. We appreciated his candor and his humor.

My experience with Bill Howe was fantastic.  We had a standard sink clog that we needed to get cleared ASAP.  The technician, Scott Bonilla, called and texted 20 minutes before arriving letting me know that he would be able to be 30 minutes early to our appointment.  When Scott arrived, he was kind, informative, and quick to solve the problem.  Once the drain was cleared, Scott stayed to ensure there were no further issues, checking for leaks or potential backup clogs for 20 minutes.  I would highly recommend Bill Howe Plumbing and specifically Scott for any plumbing needs.<//text>

<text>Steve was great.  I had an Aquasana whole home manifold filtration system installed in my garage. I tried other large plumbing companies who were only interested in selling me their own systems. Steve was the only one willing to look at my project. He was on time and professional. He answered all of my questions and did everything he said he would do. There were no surprises and it was a pleasure working with Steve. My previous plumber who I had stayed with for 30 years had retired so I was looking for a new plumber to take care of my home and business needs. I can see working with Howe for many years to come.<//text>< pictures>

Truly Exceptional Emergency Water Heater Service!  Matthew called me in the early evening right after my emergency water heater plumbing message to Bill Howe Plumbing.  Matthew was able to provide an accurate telephone estimate to replace a leaking 50 gallon water heater.

Matthew & Brandon kept me informed of the appointment by text & telephone updates while the Bill Howe office communicated appointment confirmations!

Matthew & Brandon installed a brand new 50 gallon RUUD Premier water heater in less that 100 minutes, hauling away the old leaking water heater.  Their professional installation was excellent!

The Bill Howe quoted price for a 50 gallon name brand premium water heater was way less than other plumbers and big box hardware store quotes.  Even better, the Bill Howe quoted price was exactly the installed price - including custom copper pipe installation!

It's been a pleasure to have Bill Howe Plumbing provide emergency service to our home.  Thank you to Matthew, Brandon and the entire Bill Howe team.  We're your customers for life!</Text>

I have had nothing but amazing experiences with Bill Howe. I recently moved and decided to check with a local plumbing company called Anderson and they wanted $900 to hook up a washer and dryer! I would do it myself but I wanted a plumber to do it to cover me since it’s a second story laundry. Yeah no thanks! Very thankful I called Bill Howe next.

Gage came out and did a great job. He was respectful and professional, carried out his work quickly and efficiently and was friendly. And most importantly, a fraction of the cost of Anderson (spits on ground) plumbing.<//text>

<review>I can't say enough about the quality of service but more importantly, the people at bill Howe. I called on Sunday afternoon because my water heater pilot went off. Instead of charging me $253/hr the nice woman that answered suggested a phone call. <2min later I received a call from Brandon who very patiently walked me through how to re-light my pilot light. Here's the kicker. He was ON ANOTHER JOB SIMULTANEOUSLY doing the exact same thing and was able to support me. Incredible.

This experience validates a full pipe lining they performed last year, which was very costly but there team made the experience well worth it and I'm so relieved to never have to search for another plumbing company ever again in San Diego!

Once again, I called upon my favorite repair company, Bill Howe. This is totally unsolicited.
Just wouldn't be an old homeowner without these guys.  Just finished having my gas lines replaced, my furnace duct work replaced, and this time, now had to have my corroded out and patched sewer line replaced. All repairs were at my request. Never any pressure to act on estimates. Work always done efficiently,  time lines met, quality products and happy employees. Never have had to call them back on a job. They will continue to be my go-to company. May not be the cheapest, but have learned over 30 years of owning this house, you get what you pay for. They are fair priced. I like companies where the employees are proud of the company they work for.  Shows in their work.</text>

The pilot light went out in our water heater and wouldn't relight.  I first called Discount Plumbing and they said we would need a new water heater, due to the age of the water heater and it would only cost $2,500 for a new water heater (this was after they didn't show up to the appointment).  This didn't seem right to me so I called Bill Howe Plumbing for a 2nd opinion.  The technician from Bill Howe Plumbing realized the safety switch was tripped and just needed to be reset.  This fixed the water heater entirely.  I appreciate the honesty, responsiveness, and expertise of Bill Howe Plumbing.  As they were able to save us a ton of money when a new water heater wasn't needed.</text>

Contracted to clean external sewer lines from house to street. After first day, technician stated they went 500 feet and didn’t reach city line. Got a quote for another day. 2nd day was for double price of first day. Talked to supervisor and asked for only 1 tech and 1 helper with sufficient hose and equipment to finish job. After 2 hours work on 2nd day tech said he couldn’t get past 450 feet. They gave up and never finished.

It's now been over 3 weeks since I spoke with them and was told that I would be provided with a quote to complete the work.  I have not heard anything from anyone.  If there is a plan to complete the work, I'd really like to hear about it and get some assurance that the work can be completed as initially requested.< /review>

My water heater was from 1994; corroded; the 'box' that it is housed in, was originally installed in my 1974 mobilehome and was quite dilapidated and the floor of it had weakened considerably.
The technician, Brandon, did an excellent job!
I desperately needed this * EXTENSIVE *  work done in a timely manner, for a housing inspection due in two days and it is more than I could have hoped for!! Professional, beautiful and all cleaned up afterward.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80dbffd6a74d24ed:0xd95f60f86694dfb9</gmap_id>< user_id>

The team (Jojo, Bren, Ryan, Michael) were very knowledgeable, professional, punctual, expedient and communicative.  They worked to not be intrusive in our home as they installed new Daikin heat pump/condenser AC, FAU and Mini-split systems along with replacing all our old registers with bar type registers.  They addressed every concern i had and showed their technical expertise answering all my questions.  It took only two days to complete our job and this 4-man team of professionals were prepared to work rain or shine.  We ran our systems all last night and the Daikin units worked flawlessly.  I highly recommend Bill Howe as they made the whole process from consultation to contract to final install simple and easy and the quality of work was excellent.< /Text>

The quality and ability for him to work within my budget. Manuel V. 905 explained exactly what the costs were,i  (It was weekend rates.)  Maniel V. was very understanding and very experienced. Fully able to explain to me, when I had no understanding of why i couldn't unclog. Manual V.  really knew his stuff. What he would have to do and the cost and what hed have to do if that didnt work... and the cost. Also informed me @ a 30 warranty in case the clog just moved down and returned. Absolutely one of my best experiences with a plumber!!! I wanted to tip him and he wouldn't take it. Manual V. 905  truly made your company look GREAT!! Manual V. deserves a raise or a promotion. I now know where to go if I have any plumbing issues! I'd absolutely use this company again. Thank you!!</review>

Tyair from Bill Howe came out tonight and did amazing work in a tight space under our kitchen sink. He was very professional and worked very clean. The whole project was well worth the price and the quality of work top notch. The online estimate was also super convenient. I filled it out at 10 pm and by the next morning at 8 I was already contacted by email and scheduled with an upfront price withing 20 minutes.</Review>

Arrived early, which was a huge bonus since I had had to turn off my water, and got the job done in a timely and professional manner.

Worth noting: issue arose on a Friday afternoon and they were able to come out Saturday morning when everywhere else told me I'd have to wait until Monday at the earliest.<//text>

Chris Sullivan was great!  We had an emergency backup in our pipes in the evening and Bill Howe answered the call right away and Chris was there within the hour. They gave me a fair price, did a lot of work for under $200 when I know others do less of a quality of job for more. Chris was a very nice and professional guy and clearly knew his stuff. He got the job done way faster than I expected and I really appreciate all his help!  Bill Howe is as always my go to company. Thank you< /Text>

Bill Howe, Inc. and their team of professionals have been our “go to” company for all of our plumbing and HVAC needs for years.  We had a leak in our main water line, under our street, leading to our home. We live in a rural area.  Raul was first on the scene to assess the issue. He was professional and explained all the options available, as well as, the process of proceeding with repairs.  For me, it’s a matter of trust and confidence. Bill Howe, Inc., especially Raul, delivered.  Victor, the plumber who did the repair, was professional, on time, prompt, and courteous.  The entire process was seamless, from leak detection, repair, and street restoration.  Thank you, Raul and Victor, for your professional and courteous service.  In addition, Bill Howe’s subcontractors are top notch!!  Mike, with CPL, detected the leak location.  He was professional, friendly, and answered all of my questions.  Prompt and “spot on” accurate, Mike found the leak in less than hour!  Finally, Miguel and his “right hand man” Gilbert, of Army Ant Excavations, were amazing!  They excavated the area of the leak allowing Victor to repair the pipe, then, restored our road to a better condition than what they found when they started.  Miguel and Gilbert were professional, courteous, and kept me informed at every step.
With Bill Howe, Inc., you get a team of professionals focused on providing the best service for their customers. I only call on the professionals of, Bill Howe, Inc., because they instill confidence and they do the job right!</review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Date>1615589765148<//Date><Pictures>None</Pictures><text>Charles my technician came out to do some landscape area hydro jetting. First off let me say I have never used Bill Howe before, so as the HOA President for my complex I wanted a local company to do some area jetting. The whole organization was top notch, from the Reps answerring the phone (especially during these pandemic times) to the Rep who (Hector) came my property.
Charles arrived, surveyed the property and I explained what was needed. He was very attentive, walked me through each phase of the work to be done. To say he was thorough is an understatement. Charles and Rico were so thorough that even my neighbor who is a certified plumbing was blown away. So I am not saying take my word for it, but if you need some plumbing work done give Bill Howe the opportunity to do it for you. I know have them on our calendar book as our plumber of choice. Thanks Bill Howe plumbing for being so quick to address our needs in between rain showers.

< Review>
Extremely disappointing. I called to have a drain cleared, explained the issue to two separate individuals, and a plumber was able to make it out 2 days later.  When he showed up and I explained the issue, he said I needed a drain tech because he did not have a snake on his truck. I can't speak to the quality of their work since I'm calling a plumber who can actually, you know, fix the plumbing.</Review>

<Text>Multiple posts numbered most recent to least recent:

1/2 - Doug came at the estimated time, was extremely professional and very helpful for more than just the reason we called for help. My wife smelled gas when I didn’t, Doug found multiple small(Ish) leaks under the house and set about closing them to inspection-grade quality. He had to cut through some flooring and repaired them. Most importantly for me, he explained what was going on with the pipes so I felt good about authorizing the work he deemed necessary. Doug was fantastic but everyone Bill Howe has sent to service my property has been very good too. I’ve called them more than I’ve reviewed them and can say that I was happy even when not moved to tap out an online review. You’ll pay a premium for a name brand but I can attest to the value of the cost.

2/2 - Hector came on time, well within the estimated window, and was very professional. He inspected all the areas we needed estimates on and was knowledgeable about the various issues to be addressed. He was also respectful of PPE and social distancing policies. The process was efficient and pleasant.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Bill Howe to the rescue again, we called to have our bath tub fixed. We had a plumbing we had a leak under our bath tub that was flooding our bathroom, Shane the technician came and and went right to work, he knew exactly where to go and what to do. Shane was very nice and professional, I would recommend Bill Howe to all my family and friends.< /Review>

<text>These guys were awesome!!!!! Had a washer and dryer from Best Buy delivered this afternoon and they couldn’t install because the valves on the faucets needed replacing. I immediately called Bill Howe Plumbing. They picked  up right away and had a plumber here in less than an hour and a half!!! Tris Coffin was my guy and was awesome!!! Replaced the valves in like 5 minutes, cleaned up the water, played with my chihuahuas and was out in under 20 min. And price was what I expected. Nothing too crazy.
Loved the great customer service and genuinely nice plumber who cared about my issue.

I had Anderson plumbing out regarding a clogged sewer pipe.  They charged $144 to unclog, and wanted $6k to fix the pipe.  They said I had to make a decision immediately regarding fixing the pipe which seemed off to me, and the price seemed high.  Sewer backed up again within 24 hours.

I had Bill Howe out, and they sent Louie who was amazing and extremely helpful.  He unclogged the drain within 15 mins, and took a huge chunk of roots/sludge out.  He showed me how he could tell where the problem was, and made sure there was not problem anywhere else on the line.  Anderson had told me they could not get their camera past the block so there could be problems out into the street that I would be responsible for.  Louie just but the camera in a separate access point and was able to make sure the drain was clear.

I had Bill Howe fix the compromised drain pipe, and their price was less than $4k, which was more than a third less than Anderson.  There was great communication the whole time.  Scott did the work fixing the pipe and he was nice, professional, clean and thorough.< /text>

I had Bill Howe provide lining services and replace some cast iron with new abs. All their lead plumbers on the job were great (shout out to Mike and Scott). The techs and managers know what they are doing - I never felt like I was being squeezed for money for unnecessary repairs, unlike other plumbing companies. Bull Howe understands their customer needs! They left the job site clean. Would definitely use again for other plumbing related needs!<//Text>

Absolutely terrible experience with this company.  They are not on time for appointments, will not provide  for when technician will arrive and have been unable to solve my HVAC issue after two attempts - they continue to refill the freon (and charge me for it) but not solve the underlying issue.  I would not recommend< /Text>

Bryan was FANTASTIC! He figured out the problem quickly and got to work immediately. He also stopped by his office on the way over to make sure he had supplies to fix varying sized pipes since he didn’t know what we had.

Dave and Chris called to let me know they were on the way and they arrived exactly when they said they would. They worked rapidly and efficiently to fix 3 faucets that had reduced water flow. Then they replaced the garbage disposal at no cost. I had forgotten that the previous disposal had been purchased earlier this year, but they looked it up and replaced it immediately. That kind of old- fashioned customer service is why we have been Bill Howe customers for more than 20 years.<//Text>

These guys are excellent! Always on time and professional . There have been 2 guys that have come in to help fix a root problem that I have ( roots growing around my sewage line ) and both gentlemen have been outstanding. I only remembered the name of 1; his name is Shane and I wanted to say how professional , kind and happy he was . He fixed our issue and was incredibly thorough. I have recommended them twice to friends .
Thank you ! Please continue the excellent work !!

Technician Michael H. was fantastic. He was on time for both the free estimate AND the date of service. He completed a water heater install, a water pressure regulator replacement, a bathtub faucet repair and an exterior hose bib repair in record time. He was informative and professional throughout and I would DEFENITELY hire him again. Prices were also very reasonable. DR<//Review>

The team was exceptional!  They were contracted to repipe my multi-level 3BR / 2.5 BA house.  The arrived on time every day with a great attitude.  Any concerns I had (e.g about pipe placement, valve locations) they took care of immediately, and worked diligently for three full days to finish the 4 day job AHEAD OF SCHEDULE!  Gustavo is a great asset to the company - easy to work with, very hard worker, and extremely professional.  I am very confident in the job his team did, and wish them all the best!<//Text>

<Review>The most professional, honest, and hard working home services company I've ever worked with. We had a pipe burst and Bill Howe's mitigation team sprung into action, immediately sending out people to dry out the rooms affected, worked directly with the insurance company, do the demolition and most of the repairs, and gave us honest and helpful advice and estimates for the entire restoration process. Always easy to contact with a main switchboard always available and direct emails and text messages to those involved. We had a couple of scheduling snafus and one portion of tile repair that wasn't up to our satisfaction, but Bill Howe gracefully and professionally responded to both concerns, and the rest of the project went smoother than I could have imagined an emergency repair in the middle of COVID could go. Huge thanks to Cassandra, Jerren, and Jimmy for going above and beyond.<//Review>< Date>

< review>
Today their plumber, Dan Denny (and his apprentice, Gage) replaced the plumbing that goes behind my stacked washer and dryer. I was able to get them to come out the same day I discovered the problem. They were exceptionally polite, clean in putting shoe coverings on before entering my condo, and taking time to explain everything they were doing. They also kindly answered some other plumbing questions I had.  Dan was able to explain a weird noise my water heater has been making for the last three years, when other plumbers I’ve had to my home could not explain it. It was a matter of some pipes touching a piece of metal that they shouldn’t, and he just pushed it into the right place and the sound stopped. A freebie. It is rare to get such wonderful customer service, and I will probably only exclusively go with Bill Howe Plumbing for all of my future plumbing needs. Thank you Dan, Gage, and this company! It is nice to see such wonderful service.</review>

Very professional. Martin called prior to the appointment to confirm his arrival time. Martin wore a mask the entire time he was on the job even though it was a hot 80 degree day. Martin explain the work to be done and provided me options to resolve the issue.

I'll definitely call on Bill Howe in the future.</review>

<Review>Professional and fast. We already had 3 different contractors out to identify an awful smell emitting from our guest bathroom. No one was capable. Scott identified the potential problem quickly and with the aid of their “smoke bombs” , which are effective. Took him less than an hour. We are happy to hire Bill Howe to do the repair work, especially because their quote was so reasonable!

Scott and his partner Louie were excellent! They located the source of 2 leaks in 2 different bathrooms and made the repair the same day. Fast, efficient, professional, and respectful. I would hire Bill Howe again. It’s so nice to find a company that cares about their reputation and their clients.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<review>It's incredibly disappointing that this company would advise a customer of a window between 3 and 5 when the tech doesn't show up until 5:20pm. Leaving my office at 2:30pm, I wasted my time being here waiting for a tech who showed up after the window given to me. On top of the fact I scheduled a week in advance for this appointment and called at 4pm to make sure I was on the schedule. This is very poor and unacceptable customer service on this company's part. My time is as precious as theirs and their tech's. Please be aware of their poor customer service for potential customers aware of their lack of care or concern for customers as well as their lack of courtesy.

We would like to share our experience with the Bill Howe Plumbing team.

We decided to replace our water heater, pressure regulator valve, and hot and cold-water valves that provided water to our washing machine because they would not completely shut off the water when turned in the off position.

Due to having multiple items that needed replaced, we were happy when Armando came out each time. Armando did an awesome job with replacing our water heater, pressure regulator, and water valves. He made sure everything he did had a nice clean look that made everything look great. Armando was very polite and took the time to answer all our questions. He was also very conscientious in following COVID-19 guidelines to ensure our safety as well as his own. Since Armand has helped us a few times now, it feels like he is part of our family.

We had a positive experience with the Bill Howe team, from getting estimates, to scheduling the day and time they would come to our home. All work was completed to our satisfaction.

We want to say thank you to, Nicole, Christine, Miguel, and Armando for providing us with awesome customer service!!! The Bill Howe team will be our “go to “plumbing team.<//Text>

Pattric Nealey was wonderful! He is professional, knowledgeable and empathetic. Excellent customer service. I was having a very difficult time with not being able to use my kitchen sink for days since the clog, but Pattric fixed the issue with such easiness and understanding. Sea of knowledge and experience, his work is supreme! I can finally use my kitchen again. From now on, I will always ask for Pattric! He’s a true asset.

They showed up on time on Friday. I will give them that, and only that. The technician that showed up stepped into my front door without being invited. I then asked him to go around the side of the house where the hot water heater was, and that if meet him there. He did not know how to open up the panel to the hot water heater, so I did it for him. He gave me the quote for the repair, and it was outrageous. I said no thank you, and put the panel back on myself. I do not recommend this company.</Text>

My kitchen sink was clogged and Tyair R. was able to unclog it .  He was very professional, respectful and  answered all my questions. I have used Bill Howe twice  now (replaced my toilet  last year) and have been happy with their services . They  wear a mask to follow Covid guidelines and minimize contact .  Plumbing issues are so frustrating and stressful so I am glad I trusted Bill Howe to do the job . They also offer competitive prices which is always appreciated .</review>

<review>Bill Howe Plumbing is a very professional firm.  The person who answers the phone (not sure if it has been the same woman) is very responsive and professional.  We had a toilet repair (leak) and a couple other jobs done last week.  Just discovered that the toilet continued to slowly leak after the repair.  Called them this morning and a repairman showed up within a half an hour.  He found the problem and fixed it.  No charge, of course.  As he was finishing up, another technician arrived from their restoration and repair group checking for any damage caused and/or dampness in the wall or tile floor.  All good.
This is the way a service organization should work!  Very pleased.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Bryan Casillas was the repairman sent to our home. He was professional, super nice, did a great job. They came out way earlier than they originally told us they would which was greatly appreciated since we were in a bind. It was respectful of the property, took all covid precautions, took pictures of the work he did so he could explain to me exactly what happened and how he fixed it. Would definitely call them again.<//Review>

This company used to be good but is no longer. If you are a fan of being over-changed, being stood up multiple times in a row for no-show repair men, and having to have technicians come 3-4 times on average to correctly diagnose and fix a problem then this company is for you. Otherwise, look elsewhere.<//Review>

Horrible scheduling time for maintenance services that we pay for.  Broken dishwasher is 12 days.  Broken furnace is 16 days.  That is just to have the tech come out.  Who knows if they will have the necessary parts, which would add even more time.  This is ridiculous.</Text>

Disappointed. I had high hopes, but got a confirmation that they'd come between 6 - 8p on Friday night but they never showed and didn't respond to my outreach.

<Time>1605134812470</Time><Rating>5< /Rating><text>On July 25th we had a fire sprinkler line damaged which shot water into our 3rd floor loft area for an hour before our savior Matthew R. (from Bill Howe) showed up to patch the pipe and was actually able to get the fire dept. to show up to shut the line off totally.  Additionally, a creep water mitigation guy in a creepy white van showed up and commenced to harassing me trying to get me to let him in the house to start working.  He wouldn't listen to me, so Matthew stepped in and told him he needed to go.  Matthew waited for Darwin (also from Bill Howe) to show before he left.  Darwin was just as amazing as Matthew.  He came in, I walked him thru and showed him where all the damaged areas were, etc.  Darwin painstakingly and VERY patiently dealt with our negligent/incompetent property manager for a couple hours before having no choice but to accept defeat and leave us in a very flooded home (all 3 floors flooded).  Fast forward a week later, when said property manager finally allowed someone to start working, it was Darwin who showed up again.  Still as great as the first time.  He was very patient with us, since we had to pack, etc. to get out.  I asked for paths to be left to certain things in the garage, he was more than happy to oblige.  Anytime I came to the house he was more than patient and answered any questions I had and not one time seemed bothered by my presence.  He was always very considerate of us and our things.  Things went downhill a bit from here, NOT Bill Howe's fault at all.  But super fast forward to last week when work started back up and was coming to a finish.  Yesterday, Skylar R. (also from Bill Howe) came to hook a majority of our plumbing back up.  The subcontractors threw away part of my faucet and he let me know and I opted to just buy an entire new faucet, he wasn't pushy about it at all.  Just let me know what my options were.  He was quick, efficient, and extremely professional.  Just like Matthew and Darwin he was not once bothered by my questions.  Also, one of the most impressive things of all 3 of them was their attitude toward me as a woman.  They never once spoke down to me, etc. just because I'm a chick.  :)  Our Project Manager (Jamie) was also fantastic and very professional.  Anytime I text he is quick to call and update me and stays in touch and on top of the job, stopping by to check on progress.  The subs Bill Howe used for our job were also professional and did great work.  We had no choice but to move back in while they were still working.  They were kind and patient and worked around our things, even moving stuff to clean and pick up their painters tape, then moving things back.  They were very thorough when finishing up, making sure they cleaned up after themselves, etc.  I would definitely use Bill Howe again for any of our household needs and highly recommend them.
So, to summarize: Matthew R., Darwin, and Skylar R. (listed in order of appearance) are AMAZING and Bill Howe is lucky to have them!</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<date>1603540141854< /date><Review>I never leave reviews. This experience was just unacceptable. I read reviews somewhere else obviously because the ones I saw were good. Dispatch was good and that was it. The estimates were outrageous and just kept going up. They came out to do a big job, first day they did work. Second day, not sure. Then the estimates kept going up so had to call another company to finish the work. They just didn't seem to care. When they were here, they would pack up around 4 and just leave. No word, no nothing. To reiterate what Lawrence W. said about them being thieves, that's an understatement. Not exaggerating, even one of the other plumbers that was here was shocked. Such a huge let down for such a well known company<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80dbffd6a74d24ed:0xd95f60f86694dfb9<//Gmap_id>< Resp>

<Review>Roberto discovered that our home needed to have two water regulators instead of the normal single unit.  A remodel of the home hook the kitchen area into the city water line without a method of regulation the PSI from 100 to 65 PSI which is normal.  But due to the missing regulator system, we continued to blow out seals/rings in the kitchen sink faucet.  It was confusing at first but bill Howe came through and located, fixed the issue and rechecked the other regulator to ensure it functioned correctly..  It fills good to know when I'm away (NAVY), I don't need to worry about items breaking and a repair guy taking advantage of my family and over price a repair when I'm not there.

Called Bill Howe plumbing this AM and they had a technician to our house by 12:30 PM. We had to shutoff our water last night and needed a plumber that could fix the problem ASAP. Bill Howe was upfront about the weekend pricing and they got us an appointment right away. Skylar Rhoads was our technician and he did a wonderful job for us. He fixed the problem and explained the work he was doing. He also showed me how to avoid the issue in the future. Great experience overall and we will be calling Skylar and Bill Howe when the next plumbing issue arises.<//text>

I would not recommend this company. Nice people but there are not thorough. They used a toilet auger to try and fix a sewer line clog. So our clog was only temporarily fix. Second they charge my wife and I and extra 30 minutes for travel time.Which was never stated clearly in the phone. So after paying a good amount of money we are back to square one with our sewer line clogged.< /Text>

I have used the company for HOA related repairs and had a great experience. This time if was my water heater leaking and I had another plumber here that gave a very high quote so I decided to get a second opinion. I immediately thought of bill Howe and they gave me a considerably more reasonable quote and they got someone out within hours to do the job. I will never use anyone else.<//text>

Called to have a tenant's AC issue fixed.  Tech went out but first fix did not take, company was responsive in going back out to take a look, recommended another much more expensive fix.  Receptionist who I spoke with was very rude and condescending, hence the one star rating.  Decided to go with a different company.</Text>

He's incredibly honest and extremely resourceful. When he was with another co, he solved a water line reroute issue with a unique solution that no other plumber found.  He saved us a ton of money. He will also give you great advice on cost efficient plumbing solutions like the best faucets and water filter systems. I was able to find him after moving to Bill Howe and he did a great job on our filtration system ( saved us money on that too.)  Isaiah gets 5 stars and Bill Howe gets credit for not trying to overcharge their hourly rates and charge fees for estimates like many other in the area.<//review>< UserId.>

Don't go there!!!   Sold me a water heater I didn't need!! (turns out there was nothing wrong with the old one!). Made me believe the heater was bad, when I asked several times if the problem was the heater itself.  Then charged me twice what they should have for it.  Sold me the wrong water heater, claiming they no longer made the size they were replacing, which I found out afterwards was not true. Left without checking to see if the new heater was working (which of course it wasn't).  Left water all over the place, which I am hoping what is under the heater will dry out before it rots out the wood.  I will never use this company again, and advise you not to either!< /review>

Like most there were the text and phone confirmations of appointment day/time.  The call from the serviceman (Travis), etc.  Travis was on time, we discussed the issue and went about assessing the problem and fix.  We had a leak coming through a anchor in the wall and was now dripping down the wall (from the spare bathroom).  A quick look at the ring that the bees wax compresses on noted the ring was very corroded and possibly the fix.  Even if it wasn't the fix, it clearly needed to be replaced and happy it was discovered now.  It did not fix the problem.  Sadly the wall had to be cut where we discovered the anchor I put in the wall protruded the sewage line pipe.  What I appreciated was the way t he matter was diagnosed.

Christian arrived promptly after the text notification. He was polite and friendly. After discussing the problem, he was able to find a solution in about an hour with very little addition parts cost. I would definitely recommend Bill Howe Plumbing and will use them again in the future.<//review>

Michael Castaing and his helper, I cannot remember his name, of Bill Howe, conducted a sewage line repair by lining the pipe. They did a wonderful job. Professional work. Non intrusive nor an inconvenience. No jack hammering of our floors, which another plumming outfit was going to do. They were also customer friendly. I would recommend them greatly if you need work on your sewer line. We have called Bill Howe to do other jobs for us as well with the same type of professional and courteous service. My wife and I wouldn't think of calling another plumming service now for our plumming needs. 5 Stars.< /text>

Terrible. They charged for unnecessary cleaning stating the furnace was fine. It died minutes later. I had two other companies look at it and within 10 minutes both people diagnosed same thing: destroyed motor and damaged air cond coil. Neither diagnosed by this company.<//text>

< review>
I feel very fortunate that I called Bill Howe plumbing for a second quote on a piece that had broken in my shower.  When Dave showed up he gave me hope that he could fix it for a reasonable cost and not the thousands of dollars the first plumber gave me.  A small but unique piece broke and my shower was no longer functional.  Due to the brand (a high end) and the age of the fixture it was difficult but Dave from Bill Howe came through.  He never gave up, tracked down one of the parts and repaired the other.  I am so happy,  and I can say with certainty that from now on I am calling Bill Howe.  They have earned my business for any future plumbing issues.  Thank you!<//review>

<review>My daughter dropped her Mimi’s dentures in her toilet while playing. I called Bill Howe and they sent out Daniel Swift who is by far the best service man I’ve had in a long time. He was very nice to my mom and explained to her the cost of the procedures etc. He was very professional and was also wearing a mask so I just wanted to tell Bill Howe you guys have a good person here make sure you keep Daniel around. My family will only use Bill Howe from now on. And if your wondering, yes Daniel found the dentures!!!!!!! Thanks again Daniel S

Martin and Jesus were absolutely wonderful in replacing an ancient water softener in our new house. Martin was very responsive and friendly, explaining everything he was doing and why, and really going the extra mile to make sure we knew what we were getting and how to operate and maintain the system.

< review>
We had a new ac installed in less than a day!!! Everyone wore a mask and were respectful of social distancing and cleaned up after themselves. We were asked where and how we wanted the wires/pipe run and then suggestions were made by the team to make it look even better. We didn't know about the space saving slim model and thought we were going to have to get a big loud ugly compressor.  Instead we have the slim model at the back of the garage. The whole thing is beautiful and quiet, it looks like a friendly little star wars droid and I am proud to have it! I wish we were given a choice of thermostats cause the one that was installed is not as pretty (to me, I find the display bright, large, and always on so very visible), but that will be an easy swap, and the rest of the job was just great. Thanks!<//review>

I have an account at Bill Howe since my husband and I own several rentals. The reason I gave them a three is because they will not move a washer in order to replace the angle stops. We need angle stops replaced on all of our washers in our rentals. All washers are in the garages ou in outdoors closets so damage to interior flooring would nor be an issue. I was told they don't move heavy items. We are in our 70's and we don't move heavy items either. A company the size of Bill Howe should be able to address and fix this.<//Review>

<Text>We used their services for maintenance of our water heater and AC/furnace. The guys, Miguel and Enoch, both showed up on time at the beginning of the booked slot. Both were very professional, friendly, and did a fine job. Given these coronavirus times, they had face coverings. They also brought their own shoe covers and took care walking around the house. It turned out our water heater and regulator were worn out and had to be replaced. Miguel guided us patiently through the options. Enoch added some parts to the furnace and compressor for safety and longevity. Thankfully they took payment by card online on their tablet because I don’t handle cash these days. Overall, timely and smooth service! Of course, I do not know about the quality of the new parts until we get to use them over a longer period. :) The parts are not cheap but the rates seem reasonable and at market value.</Text><UserId.>105042994244673123737</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

< review>
I called Bill Howe to have my whole house water filter and water softener installed. I ended up moving my water heater at the same time to free up some unusable space in my garage. Martin took care of the water filter and softener install while Allan handled moving the water heater. They both did great work. l definitely will recommend to family and friends!< /review>

Excellent service provided by Martin. Not only does he do excellent work, he also educates you and teaches you about the service he’s providing that way you have a clear understanding of what’s being done to your house.

I do not recommend because they failed to show up for the service appointment and lacked the decency to make a simple phone call.

We needed urgent help due to our furnace leaking water all over our floor. I set up appointment with this company because they assured me they could service it same-day. I canceled my plans and waited all day for them. No one showed up. I called three times. Each time they promised a technician would call me back shortly. No one ever bothered to call or show up.

The delayed/missed appointment is forgivable. The discourtesy is not. How hard is it to make a 30 second phone call to tell us the truth and cancel the appointment? This business left my family in the lurch and wasted my time. I do not recommend.< /Text>

We have had other people come out to look at our plumbing problem and we get excuse after excuse as to why the work can’t be performed.  And those that have done work it was not done correctly, still had leaks.  Bill Howe (Luis and Brandon) came out today and fixed the problem.  I recommend anyone looking for plumbing work to contact Bill Howe.  If it’s a home warranty issue, don’t waste your time on the companies they refer you too, just go straight to Bill Howe.< /review>

We live in an older home in Coronado so we have the occasional plumbing issue. Justin, Senior Technician, had superior communication, arrived on time, and was knowledgeable. He went above and beyond to identify, troubleshoot and take care of our problem. I will recommend this company based on Justin’s performance. A plus, he didn’t mind that my two small terriers were nearby to assist.<//Review>

<Review>Later evening call, (why oh why are the problems always “after hours”?!), reception/dispatch was very kind and up front about cost.  Luis was dispatched to us, called promptly to confirm, arrived within the stated time, assisted my husband with clearing the stuck snake and was on his way.  Would use again!<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<text>I purchased a reverse osmosis system water filtration system from Costco with the intent of installing it myself. It was easy enough to install, however, getting it not to leak at every connection was a different story. After much frustration I called these guys. They showed up on time which is refreshing. Martin and the other guy that came out were able to fix the multiple issues quickly and explained what they did and  what parts they used.
Plumbing service is expensive, no doubt about it. However, peace of mind knowing that it was done right it priceless. Highly appreciate their service and attention to detail.<//text><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1583172942972, 'text': 'James, thank you for the great review.

Martin came out the first time and knew exactly what needed to be done. He went online and showed me what part I needed to order. I placed the order while he was here and it gave me an estimated time of delivery. We scheduled the next meeting for that day. The part showed up two days early. Someone from the company called me to confirm the appointment the day before. Martin showed up, installed the part rather quickly and resolved the issue many others couldn't. Martin went above and beyond needless to say I am extremely pleased with him and the company overall. I am very happy to write a review when I receive exceptional service.< /Review>

Bill Howe were quick to come to the scene and do the job with our property. And from the pictures reviewed (haven't been able to see them personally, but through AIM Realty who recommended them) they did a good and thorough job.

However, they did not communicate with us (the co-owners on the house) about the costs, and we each ended up signing a contract (that's right, two separate contracts) that they basically tried to muscle their way into getting every cent from them. They wouldn't even respond to me when I asked them to clarify the price owed, rather I got a response from them about 5 months later through the lawyer they hired.

So, the co-owner on the house felt they were charging an excessive amount and didn't want to pay it. Personally, they did not communicate with me at all about how much the total cost would be, or that they were exceeding the estimated rate.

Anyway, we ended up settling for a smaller amount then they demanded and they paid for their lawyer's fees.< /text>

They claim to be transparent with estimating and charges for services.  I asked 4 times for a complete breakdown explanation on the cost for a new water heater installation.  My garage was flooding from the old water heater.  After 3 email requests, I sent a hand written letter, personally addressed to Mr/Mrs Howe.
I never heard from them.  I continued to receive the same “one line-item” email (without defining charges).
The bill: $1700.  I think I deserved a complete breakdown.  I got it ... finally, after they had charged my credit card.< /Text>

Horrible customer service. I have never had a manger yell at me. Very argumentative and will not honor any warranty work. Please, there are many other companies out there to use. I would avoid at all costs.</review>

<Text>My central air-conditional stopped blasting the cold air. I noticed the outside compressor fan also stopped working.   First, I called Baker's Electric Home energy, and the technician came out and took a look at the condenser told me that my compressor failed. I need to replace the entire air condition unit, which would cost me at least 8000 dollars for a new 3 U air-condition units.   Today, I called Bill Howes Family and Companies,  Alvin Troyer, technician took a lot at the condenser and found a  loose wire. He replaced the burnout component, and my air conditioner is working again. elvin was friendly and very knowledgeable with his work
Thank you for your honesty and friendly service. I highly recommend Bill Howe for their excellent service.<//Text><user>111599024008757486401</user>< name>

<Review>This company is prompt, courteous, and they fix the problem right away. I only have one bathroom at my home and they came within a half hour. I have used Bill Howe twice now and their staff is excellent. The timing is punctual (which is probably my favorite part) and they know what they are doing. The staff and especially the technicians/plumbers are very friendly and get to work right away. You can count on them to be there and to provide excellent support.< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>It was late Saturday night and while Bill Howe is considerably higher in price than some competitors especially for after hours it was completely worth it for the service I received and the timely fashion that they arrived. Professional, courteous, and informative John called before he was coming, gave me an eta and showed up on time. I can't say enough at how incredibly grateful I am for John Friend my Plumbing and Drain Technician that came out and took care of my water heater. I had just found out at the end of day that my water heater wasn't working and I had a guest that just arrived and needed to shower so it was important to have it working ASAP. John personally made the visit spectacular and I appreciated his help and honest feedback. I'm definitely using them again in the future.

Ron was simply amazing. He empathized with my leak in a bathroom tub faucet, he was really professional, quick and knowledgable and was compassionate that, as a new homeowner, I didn't know where the water heater was. I feel like with the advice and knowledge that he gave to me, I made out ahead with what the cost was. I would love to request him specifically for any other issues I may have in the future for plumbing.<//Review>

< Review>
We called Bill Howe because we had a sticky faucet in the bathroom vanity.  They sent a plumber who worked for several hours and charged us $738 for the service.  The first time we used the faucet after this service, it came off in our hands.  The next day they sent another plumber who took the faucet and said he'd return with a replacement.  After two weeks, with no time frame for when the new part would arrive, we complained about the hole in our sink where the faucet should be and they sent someone to put in the old faucet until the new one came.  After over a month, the new part arrived and they sent someone to install it.  Their follow-up service was great, but we think $738 to repair a sticky faucet was extremely expensive.  We will not use Bill Howe in the future.<//Review>

<text>I have used this company three times in the last year. They have always arrived promptly and have been honest and thorough throughout the service. The quotes seem to be pretty reasonable I think they try to keep them as low as possible. Today Patrick was awesome, Tom has been very good in the past. I’m sure all the guys there are great. They really take their time to explain what the issue is and what your options are  as far as getting it fixed.  It seems like they really try to find an economical solution which is refreshing in this type of work. Definitely recommend without a doubt.<//text>< Pics>

Bill Howe is my go-to for plumbing with absolutely no hesitation.  Today was no different.  The plumber was courteous, helpful, and I felt he was watching out for my best interest.  I'm an older single woman and so often the older woman is a target to be taken advantage of.  I have no worried with Bill Howe Plumbing.  I feel I can trust them and I know their service is above and beyond what is expected.  I can't go wrong. :-)<//Text>

We’ve used BH for 30 years, in multiple homes. We have referred other family & friends for their homes and rental properties. They may be more expensive than a handyman but when you have a bigger or more complex project that requires multiple technician experts, they can’t be beat. We’ve never heard any regrets about calling Bill Howe.<//Review>

< review>
In the middle of a world wide pandemic Bill Howe and all of the wonderful service technicians, office staff from plumbers to reconstruction teams were so helpful.
My 87 year old parents hot water heater blew out causing a flood and drywall damage to their garage. I called Bill Howe and they sent a plumber out the same day to remove the old hot water heater and set up a temporary hot water heater. They took my worries away about my parents going without hot water and dealing with a flooded garage.
Each day after a Bill Howe technician was at the house performing clean up work, reconstruction, and hooking up a new hot water heater. Everyone wore masks, gloves, and protective coverings at all times.
I want to say thank you to everyone at Bill Howe for taking care of this disaster in the garage during a medical disaster of epic proportions.
I have used Bill Howe in the past and I now have their number on speed dial.<//review>

However, my wife and I both got the same reaction from people when we told them it cost almost $2000.  Everybody we told said we got ripped off.  They did good work and they did it fast, but boy did they charge us for it.  About 2 hours work, $500 labor and $1400+ for the parts.  Ouch. Live and learn I guess.

So, very very expensive, but great service.  If you don't mind paying top dollar, call them.<//text><Resp>{'time': 1574186290301, 'text': 'Scott, thank you for the review.

<Text>Our water heater went out the weekend before Christmas 2019. We called several plumbing companies for quotes and they all seemed pretty high. So, we decided to call Bill Howe and they were very reasonable; they came out on Monday, which was the same day we called them. They gave me a estimated quote over the phone. They were out by 11am and gave me a quote that I was happy with. The young man that came out, I believe his name was Brandon, was very professional and knowledgeable and installed our new water heater before 3pm that same day. I will definitely recommend Bill Howe to family and friends.< /Text><date>1581624128451</date><userid>112826874644949382629< /userid><pictures>None<//pictures><name>Trish P<//name>< Resp>

My family and I have had a fantastic experience with Bill Howe! We first had a new hot water heater installed by Tris, who was very professional and knowledgeable in the field. We opted for a tankless water heater install, but due to some issues with our house design ended up replacing it with a new tank. Tris was great throughout the whole process and made it as seamless as possible, would highly recommend to anyone!
Our next experience was with a new kitchen sink, faucet, and disposal installation. Due to our countertops being custom we had several issues finding a sink that would work for our pre-existing cutout. Troy was fantastic throughout the whole process and wanted to make sure things were done correctly. We ordered a few different sinks until we found one that finally fit. I would give Troy 10 stars if I could! Our new sink looks great and we couldn't be happier!</review>

I've been using Bill Howe Plumbing for at least 20 years now. I've used some other plumbing companies during this period as well and can attest to the fact that if you want it done right the first time, Bill Howe Plumbing is your best choice. The one time I had to ask for a return visit because something wasn't quite right, they sent out a guy right away on a Sunday to fix it, even though it could have waited till Monday.< /Text>

Roberto M from Bill Howe Plumbing was great! I called for a drainage issue in our kitchen sink, and I was scheduled for a tech to come out within three hours! Roberto was professional, diagnosed the problem right away, and even gave us some background on what the problem was and how to avoid it. Super fast, very reliable, and very economical. Always happy to work with Bill Howe!<//text>

<Text>We had a clogged bathtub in our kids bathroom. I made an appointment online for a technician to come out that same afternoon. I received a text detailing Covid-19 prevention protocols that our technician would be taking, as well as his photo so we could easily verify his identity.
The technician, Scott, was prompt and professional. He resolved the problem very quickly and the price was under $100, which was more than reasonable. We would recommend Bill Howe Plumbing and would definitely use them again. Thank you!!</Text>< gmap_id>

< review>
We are having our kitchen remodeled by Bill Howe and while the project is still not finished, I had to give a review of the actual plumber who did the dishwasher, faucet, and under-sink plumbing installation. Christian spent more than 7 hours here because he had to go into the wall and install angle brackets, plus re-do the entire sink drainage and water filtration system. When he discovered one thing after another he consistently made the best decision for me as the customer, ensuring that everything worked perfectly before finally leaving after 6, to go to another job.

I felt that he was really dedicated to doing a good job, and made sure that we were totally satisfied with his part of the job before leaving. Living in an old house (1955) he had to make a lot of adjustments and did so with expertise and professionalism. Really nice guy too! I would recommend Christian for any plumbing job!<//review>

Every interaction with Bill Howe Plumbing was exceptional. My technician Justin was timely, professional, and kept the work space clean. Even when there was a snafu with my original appointment timing, they jumped through hoops to make it right. I will absolutely be using Bill Howe again.<//text>

Corey arrived on time called while on his way. Like how I was texted a picture of the technician in advance. Nice safety feature! He arrived donning all covid safety requirements (not that I care). He asked what the issue was, and then explained his plan of attack. Using the valve stem replacement kit he replaced both valve stems. As any home owner knows, that you might as well as while your in the thick of things! He showed me both valve stems and I was surprised that the one actually worked. He also went the extra mile and snugged up the wigley pipes in the wall with the new escutcheons! He left the shower in the same condition in which he found it...clean!  Very happy with the service!</Text>

<review>A very honest company.
There was dampness near my water heater so I called Bill Howe to lake a look and estimate replacing the water heater. The  plumber they sent was very polite, and quickly determined the water heater was not leaking, the drain line was just slightly open. He easily could have tried to sell me a new water heater. instead he tightened  the drain line and was on his way.   I appreciate his honesty.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><rate>5<//rate>< Resp>

Horrible customer service!! Avoid at all cost!!

I set up an appointment online, to my surprise they called me within 10 minutes to setup the appointment. Unfortunately they never showed up, no call, no show, no nothing!

I called the next day to see what happened and a very rude man on the phone blamed me for leaving work early saying I should have waited for them to call before heading home.< /Review>

Tony was awesome!  He took extra time to clear out not just the clog,  but really cleaned out the pipes.  He ran water for a while to make sure it was running  quickly.   (Another drain company had been here,  but couldn't clear the pipes,  and just made the situation much worse. ) When Tony got here, the sink was full of sludge,  which he bailed out. After he cleared the pipe   he even cleaned out my sink!  That's service for you!  Thanks so much Tony!  A+++< /text>

Tony came to check out the roots I had growing into my toilet line. Super nice guy, ended up getting most of the root intrusion issue out of the lines so I could flush larger, more solid masses (not urine, if you catch my drift). Much appreciated, super nice guy, cleaned up well. Now I'm off to see how the fix handles those more solid masses...< /text>

Great work moving the supply lines under the kitchen sink and replacing the 21 yr old (!) water heater with a brand new one. The plumber did a great job discussing different options to help come up with the best plan. He finished the job quickly and kept the house clean. Bill Howe also gave the best pricing for the work to be done. They continue to provide excellent service for best cost in San Diego.<//Text>

I called several plumbing companies before I landed on speaking to Brittany at Bill Howe plumbing.  She was inviting and responsive and sounded like she really wanted to help me.  After telling her what I was looking for she found a plumber who could install my water filtration system the next day!   Not only did Martin show up on time but he was 30 minutes early!   He told me what was going to happen and asked my preferences for the installation.  A part wasn’t working properly and he had the piece to replace it!   He even called the company and ordered a backup piece for me just in case it became a problem!

Thank you for your time and services.  I will be using Bill Howe as my go to plumbing service from now on.<//text>

First time ever working with Bill Howe Plumbing and I was blown away. Extremely happy. They were responsive, fair and the assessment of my plumbing issue was concise and accurate. The plumber whom I worked with, Dooud, was extremely professional but also was an advocate for me when he noticed that there could have been damage created by the utility company. I would use them for all my plumbing needs</Review>

We needed a plumber urgently for a relatively simple issue that was beyond our comfort level. It was a perfectly smooth process to contact the service and get a technician out same day on a Sunday. The technician was properly prepared with the right equipment to get the job done. Overall, very pleased with the ease of the process.< /review>

<Text>Owing a historic home is always an adventure. Our 1928 gas furnace was turned off for termite fumigation and because the crawl space is minimal we needed a professional to get it up and running. I called Bill Howe Plumbing and got an appointment that week. Dan and came out and bravely squeezed under the house. After inspecting the furnace, he determined that we had a small leak in one of the lines and needed to replace a valve. He put the valve on order. I got a call when the part was in and was able to schedule for the next day. Dan came back, replaced the valve, and got the furnace relit and functioning. We also needed a water line installed for our refrigerator. He was able to use an existing cold water line from our sink and plumb it under the house and across the kitchen to the refrigerator. His work was meticulous and careful, as it required drilling into the floor and under sink cabinet. I highly recommend Bill Howe Plumbing for their expert knowledge and professionalism!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><user_id>100028492354276044066< /user_id><gmap_id>0x80dbffd6a74d24ed:0xd95f60f86694dfb9<//gmap_id>< username>

Mr. Victor Gonzalez was a stellar employee. Called 30 minutes before my appointment as a courtesy. Professionally dressed and polite, informing me with regular updates throughout the visit. Offered a promotional discount not only on the services provided - which he completed during the same visit this morning - but a discount on the estimate for replacing my 9 year-old water heater. Knows his work extremely well and great at answering questions. Definitely will request Mr. Gonzalez next time!< /Review>

Dealing with Bill Howe was easy, I called and was greeted by LaKeisha, who provided exceptional and friendly customer service. She helped me find a convenient appointment to repair my shower valve. My schedule was for this afternoon and Tris called when he was on his way and arrived on the early side of my schedule. He took a look at the issue and told me how long it would take and gave me an estimate up front. He went right to work and communicated with me throughout the process. He completed the job quickly and the cost was reasonable. I highly recommend Tris, Lakeisha, and Bill Howe.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
The water heater in my mother-in-laws house started to leak after only 4 years in service. I checked the installation of the old one and found it to be very shoddy. It sits outside in a dedicated closet. The installation details were not filled out, it was not in a pan but sitting on the cement floor. The connections were not really that secure. I shut it all down, and told her to call Bill Howe. They came out last year and fixed a clogged main line with great efficiency.

She told me it was installed, so I went over to check it out. The installation was very good. It is now centered in the closet, sitting in a non-rust pan raised off the ground, all the paperwork is accessible, the details are filled out on the stickers, the plumbing and gas lines are new and properly routed. Just an outstanding job and great attention to detail all around.
They are local and care about what they do, more so than other plumbers and pipe-fitters I have dealt with. The team is knowledgeable and friendly. If they don't know, they ask! Parts are stocked in the truck so delays are not an issue.
If you need any plumbing work done, give Bill Howe a call. The right price, the right parts, the best team!
Thank you!< /Review>

After having massive problems with my home warranty company at the same time that I had a water heater leaking water in my house I was able to call Bill Howe plumbing and was treated exceptionally well, they responded immediately, and saved the day. My home warranty company felt it was OK to schedule a plumbing diagnostic visit next week. Five days away with no hot water and a leaking tank in my house was not acceptable. I called Bill Howe plumbing because so many of my peers in real estate shared with me how nice they were to work with and how fair they were with their pricing. Not only do I have hot water but we have a high level of confidence that the entire job was done exceptionally well.  As a realtor myself I learned to recommend quality companies like Bill Howe plumbing over any home warranty company which is part of many real estate transactions. Thank you Bill Howe plumbing</Text>

Had a couple of different plumbing issues.  Bill Howell was responsive and sent Saul and his co worker at 9 AM the next morning.  They were pleasant, knowledgable, and very careful to test their work before leaving.  I would certainly use this company again.<//text>

We woke up to a broken water heater during Covid.  Bill Howe was the only company who could be here today to help. Steven was very knowledgeable, friendly and efficient. Others quoted almost $1000 over the replacement cost that Bill Howe quoted, and no one could help us right away. We are so thankful! Thank you Steven, for working hard during these times and  saving our weekend!  They also take Amex, bonus points!!<//review>

<review>I have been using Bill Howe Plumbing since I moved to California ten years ago and have found the service to be excellent, very professional, and timely.
The real test was two years ago when I came back to a burst pipe. The Restoration Team worked miracles by overseeing and repairing a major mess, relieving me to pick out flooring and new refrigerator.
I highly recommend them.</review>< Pictures>

<Text>Well, what started out being only a toilet replacement, ended up being a 3 day event with holes in drywall and almost in outside stucco as well. We were luck enough to have Mikey and Brian help us! They were very honest, communicative, detailed, & hardworking. At one point, they were not 100% sure about next steps due to the funky location & structure of the piping. So, they called their supervisor who ended coming over to offer his advice. We now have an awesome toilet that, we can say with certainty, has been properly installed I highly recommend Mikey & Brain from Bill Howe!<//Text>< Name>

I don't remember his name I think it's Tony, I did write down his truck number and he drives truck 293. Just want to say you are very lucky to have him. He is awesome. I was on the side of the road on the 94 freeway with a flat for awhile and nobody would stop to help. Your technician pulled over behind me without thinking twice and asked if I needed help. I had never changed a tired before so in joy I said yes please! He jumped right to it and changed it so fast. He even asked if I needed anything else. If I ever need a plumber I will sure call Bill Howe Plumbing! Thanks!</Review>

<Review>Tony and Jesus did a great job. We had a toilet leak, which after some discussion, we just decided to go ahead and replace our old 15+ year toilet. They were able to install the new toilet and stop the leak, same day!. The leak was small but we wanted to catch it before it got bigger. We always count on Bill Howe for our plumbing needs and even had them do work for my brother too. Thank you Tony and Jesus, great work ethic and very professional. Hopefully we won’t need to call you soon, but if we do we’ll be calling you!<//Review>< pictures>

I had a problem with my toilets with a leak and that they both kept running. It was time to do something. Isaiah came out the same day I called, gave me recommendations and installed two new energy efficient toilets that day! I’ve been using Bill Howe services for quite a few years now and I am never disappointed!</Text>

Michael came out Saturday to evaluate the water heater that was not working.  He was able to get it going again but warned due to the age of the heater it might stop working again.

I called the number was able to leave info for a call on Monday, I also used the online chat service via the website.  Both exchanges were pleasant and efficient. I phoned back on Monday morning as I wanted to ensure an appointment for that day to replace the heater. I was given an appointment window for that afternoon.  Michael called came out and replaced the heater.  He was fast and clean, taking care by covering the rugs.  When he was done it was if he was never there.

So I called Bill Howe. Remembering the Padres commercial,  somewhat reluctant.   Got a quote and time slot on the phone.  Within 2 hours of my call.  Technician came out told us about charges,  written.
Chris was done, and cleaned up
Very professional.  Within quote. Water flowing.  Could not be happier.

<Review>I really value companies that care about their customers and treat them with respect. I had a problem that was fixed two months ago that unfortunately resurrected itself and it was drip drip drip annoying. I was technically out of the warranty period but they fixed it at no cost (hopefully I got a lemon last time.) Last time I had a young guy who was new to the trade and this time I requested someone more seasoned. I probably had to wait longer but Ron was really awesome. He was fast and answered all my questions. Ron also pointed out how to fix other problems. I knew they were problems but it's hard to even know where to begin sometimes (and what order to fix them in.) If you want someone a bit more seasoned (+20 years experience), I'd ask for Ron; I certainly will.

Also as a millennial I absolutely hate calling on the phone. I'll procrastinate until it's crucial. Bill Howell is ahead of many of its competitors and let's you schedule appointments online. With the plumbing problem reoccurring, I wanted to talk to someone so I went to their website and was looking up business hours to call the next day and lo and behold someone chatted me.  I absolutely love chat messaging. Karina collected all my info and said someone would call me the next day, which they did (super fast too, by 8 am the next day!) Only thing that could have made this better was scheduling via chat but sometimes you do have to talk to a person, maybe one day.... Every person I talked to was super nice. You aren't talking to someone in another country. They even called me when they were running late to tell me they hadn't forgotten me (and then Ron literally called 4 minutes later.)< /Review><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1576519356239, 'text': "Kathreen, thank you for the great review.

<Review>Last weekend my house had a sudden water leak, called Bill Howe to have a plumber check it and confirmed that there is a leak. Only bad thing was I had to wait until the following Monday for the restoration guys to come in. Monday came, here comes the team of Danny Moreno and his buddy Fernando. Let me tell you about those two, they were professionals. I had so much questions about my water damage at home. Danny and Fernando did not hesitate to answer all my questions, even the stupid ones. Danny advised me to call my insurance and get the ball rolling for my claim. Danny and Fernando were at the house for 5 days straight, making sure that my walls and carpet are getting dry to prevent further damage and everyday I would get an update just so I’m informed on what’s going on and the progress of their work. So to Danny and Fernando, a big thank you. One job is done and on to the restoration part.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I had the plumbing replaced including the plumbing for the kitchen sink, garbage disposal, and the cast iron sewer line underneath the house replaced. I also had approximately 56’ of sewer re-lined.

Patrick came out to do the sink plumbing and sewer line replacement. He did a phenomenal job.  He was professional, and the work looks stellar.

Zach and James came out to do the lining. They also did a fantastic job. They even took the time to write up a note for my neighbor who wasn’t exactly pleased to learn that we share a sewer line.  They went above and beyond.

Melissa was my contact with the company, and she ensured everything went as planned.

Overall, I am very happy with the work completed. I would hire these folks again or recommend them to others.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Work was completed on time and was well done. It would have been nice to receive an itemized bill at the time of service. Did not receive complete bill until one week later. The plumber was here for 1.5 hours. We were told the labor cost was $169 per hour. We had a water pressure regulator replaced for $350 with one hour of labor charged. We were charged $1200 for a comfort valve installation  with labor cost of $269. We do not understand how an extra hour of labor was added to our bill.<//Review>

ASI tech attempted to get me to buy a $3800.00 water heater to replace my 8 year old unit and REALLY used every tactic to get me into a $5600 tankless unit. ASI didn't even bother to discuss fixing my current unit.
Danny from bH came out today and completed a full evaluation and FIXED my unit for $530.00. He also gave me a fair quote for a new system at MY request. Absolutely no pressure.
This was a great first experience with BH and Danny D is s a credit to the company.< /text>< Time>

We have been a customer of Bill Howe for several years now and they always impress. We just had them install a cast iron tub and re-route the shower line. Mike Lacey and team did a great job and the price was very reasonable.  We highly recommend them for any plumbing or air conditioning needs.< /review>

<review>We requested service on Thursday. An appointment was promptly made for Friday. Don arrived on time with a smile, diagnosed our broken water heater, recommended the appropriate replacement size, described the warranty options, suggested valve and door repairs, left to obtain the new heater, let me know he was back, installed the new heater and reviewed the costs. All was done with very professional manner and pleasant demeanor. First rate service. Thank you!</review>< Pictures>

I had the opportunity to work with John Friend at Bill Howe.  He was punctual, knowledgeable, and patient with me in answering all of my questions very thoughtfully.  He was sweet with my baby girl and elderly dog and even arranged his return around my daughter's nap time.  Truly a great technician.  I will be sure to request him specifically for any plumbing needs that may come up in the future.  Thanks John!< /text>

<text>Hot water tank replacement.  Prompt and efficient.  Friendly service.  Quality tank.  Done in one day, all cleaned up, thoroughly explained.  Only replaced what needed to be replaced - no bill padding with extras.  Great price.  When our other tank goes, I'll call Bill Howe.< /text>< pictures>

My water heater started leaking yesterday, Sept 14 (on a weekend).  Bill Howe responded the same day that I called and installed a new water heater same day.  John, the technician, did a superb job replacing the leaking water heater with a new.  My family and I were able to take a warm shower during the evening..<//text>

<Text>0 stars is where I stand. Poor communication, terrible workmanship. Everything they have done in there restoration needs fixed or replaced. No supervisor has ever showed up and it took more than 6 hours for 2 guys to change a water heater. They had to come back 2 days later and finish running overflow pipes because they were not done. There a joke.</Text>< Rating>

< Review>
I had Bill Howe fix a simple leak underneth my house in Janury of 2020.Well today being 4-18-20 I go underneth my house to check it out.To my surprise its still leaking, and I find that theres so much water down there that it looks like its been leaking easly for weeks if not months So I call Bill and she says its no longer under warranty and that they want to charge me again  for a leak that I already paid to get fixed. So now I find myself with a leak and  out over 700.00 dollars for  a leak that did not get fixed.  I guess the old saying is true. If you want something done right fix it yourself!< /Review>

The next day, he installed a new unit and also discovered and replaced my broken main water pressure valve. And, to my surprise, he offered to re-install and check out my non-working  bathroom under-sink electric water heater... at no charge. In only a few minutes, he had it working perfectly.

Dan Denny came out to replace a hose in our kitchen faucet and determine why our bathroom faucet had a leak, both at the faucet, and under the sink.

He not only fixed my problem within about 30 minutes  but let me know why the issue happened. Turned out a previous general contractor I called did a not to code quick fix and caused my problem.

I was very thankful and impressed with John Friend’s professionalism and honesty. I will be calling and asking for John for all future work.<//review>

Trust is a primary element of anyone coming into your home.  Quality of work comes a close second.  When Samuel and Carlos walked into my home, I felt comfortable.  These gentlemen were polite, got right to work and extremely trustworthy.  They finished the job within the stated amount of time and did an EXCELLENT job.  Boll Howe rocks!!< /review>

<Review>Nate Coffin did a great job the work that needed to be done in our hall way bathroom.  He replaced our vanity faucet.  The shower faucet required extra work .The valve needed to be replaced. The new brush nickel valve cover gave our shower a new look.  We were very pleased with the out come.  Nate is a very pleasant person and a great plumber.  He knows his job.  He cleaned up when he was done.  In the future we will be requesting Nate.< /Review>< Pictures>

Gabriel got to the house at the exact time promised on the same day I called. He deduced the problem (water surrounding a newly installed water heater) and the proposed fix in about 5 minutes. It took him about half an hour to locate and retrieve the part at a nearby supplier (new pressure regulator) and had it installed minutes later. Everything exactly as promised. I have a handful of rental properties both local and out of state. If only I could get this kind of service every time an issue arose. Highly recommend Bill Howe.< /Text>

We've gone through a few different plumbers over the last 20 years, but I've settled on Bill Howe Plumbing and have been using them exclusively for the last few years. I always felt like I was being overcharged by the other plumbers, but I don't get that feeling with Bill Howe Plumbing. They seem to be fair and they haven't missed an appointment yet.<//Text>

<Review>I called Bill Howe to deal with a plumbing and restoration matter based on their favorable reviews, and I am so glad that I did. Ricardo and his team were outstanding- polite, professional, punctual, knowledgeable and neat!  He helped coordinate everything for me with our insurance company and with the other team members at Bill Howe.  I really can’t remember the last time I have experienced such extraordinary service coupled with excellent work. I will use Bill Howe going forward for any of my plumbing, heating or ac needs. Companies like this are hard to find these days.

<user_name>Devils<//user_name>< Review>
I had a hot water pipe break under the slab of my house. Yikes! I called Bill Howe and the response was cool and collected but also had a sense of urgency to come help me.
The technician/ plumber arrived 5 minutes early, was clean, courteous and, yes, had a sense of urgency to stop firther damage fast.
The technician detected the location of the leak very fast using high end equipment and provided several options to fix the piping and the pros and cons of each.
His work was swift but of high quality. Clean welds, clean cuts in the drywall (which make it easier to repair) and vacuumed up after himself.
Also along the way when damage was found to other pipes he showed photos of what he found and even tightened a loose fitting in the attic when he observed an unsafe condition with a pipe.
Once the work was complete the tech explained everything he did and he left the house cleaner than he found it. He left no evidence of dust or work having been done.
Bottom line, Bill Howe and their technicians have mastered the work they do and I will call them again for any future plumbing issues.</Review>

Great! I called and was able to get same-day service. The plumbers were friendly and polite. The service took less than 15 minutes. The plumber first checked to see whether this was simply a matter of resetting the garbage disposal. It wasn't. I had a real clog, which required snaking and clearing. After clearing the clog, the plumber let the water run full force for several minutes to ensure that clog was definitely gone. I have not had any problems with that drain since (two months later).<//Text>

<rating>5<//rating><review>Tony was great. Very pleasant, courteous. Quite thorough and clean. He provided an initial estimate, and even if there was a bit of an iteration due to the specific space in my home he had to operate, he was proactive in making the changes needed to fix our insinkerator issue. even though he could have taken a short cut in just patching up the previously existing piping, he prioritized doing it right even if it meant changing the previous configuration that was a bit of a short cut. I appreciate his approach of not taking a short cut.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

We couldn't have been more pleased with the rapid response we received from Bill Howe Plumbing. Fortunately our situation was not a true emergency, although we needed it taken care of quickly. I called late in the afternoon, set up a window of time and Michael was out first thing the next morning. He ended up fixing some other issues we had been postponing and educated us about calling the city about a potential issue with the water meter. Michael was super professional, very kind and courteous and we appreciated all his efforts.</review>

The plumbers arrived precisely on time at 8:00 AM to install a new water line from the street to the house since the original was leaking badly.  The work was done in a highly prompt and efficient manner.  I really appreciate the "leave it as you found it attitude" of the team that did the work.  They sodded the trench before it was dug and the sod was placed back when done. The trench dirt was placed on plastic so it could all be returned to the trench not leaving any on the lawn.  Also even though the what the plumbers and I thought were tiles unexpectedly turned out to be 4 1/2 inch concrete the team took on the extra effort without complaint and did not charge extra.  Again with "leave it as you found it" care was taken when cutting the concrete to cut in the "grout lines" of the tiles on top and it was able to be placed back as is was without damage.  All the fine details we agreed on were like the new shutoff valve to the irrigation system were done without having to remind or nag them.   Today I did a leak test on the system, when I left for work the water meter read  73738.76 when I returned it read 73738.76. This shows the work was done right the first time.

I really appreciate the hard and excellent work the team did and it really exceeded my expectations.  I would use this team again for future work.< /review>

Josh did an awesome job of solving my clogged toilet.  He tried one technique that didn't work.  And then got creative with a second technique to avoid removing the toilet completely.   Very satisfied and recommend!  Reasonable rate too compared to 3 other plumbers I called.

Steven came for a separate toilet job and I'd give him 6 stars if I could.   Professional, courteous, knowledge and will try to request him for all future jobs.   Well done for hiring this guy!< /Text>

< Review>
We were very pleased with Bill Howe's workmanship and professionalism of our slab leak restoration. They handled the entire restore project from beginning to end. Their project managers were on top of the project the entire time, to insure that schedules were met.

Additionally, all of the Bill Howe employees were prompt (showed up when the said they would every time), neat  looking (uniforms were clean every time at the start of their task we were very impressed with this feature) friendly, very polite and helpful.

We would  definitely use Bill Howe again for future work and highly recommend him to others.

Thanks again to all the people at Bill Howe that got our house back together once again.<//Review>

Patrick was friendly and informative. He explained what needed to be done, and what was causing our issue. When he had to go and get a part when he felt it was taking too long he gave me a call to let me know where he was and that he hadn’t forgotten about me. In all honesty he had the repair assessed, part obtained and replaced all before the original repair window was up. He was professional and kind. I would highly recommend him and the company he represents. Thanks!</review>

Bill Howe Plumbing is the place to go for quality work! Yesterday, DJ provided us with a thorough estimate of work to be performed.   Today our OUTDOOR plumbing needs were met with great satisfaction by our tech DJ. He cut, welded and installed manual on/off levers and other required work to make our three outdoor faucets water tight. No more expensive water bills in our future from wasted water! And our valve for filling our pool now works without the need to use a garden hose.
We’ve been a customer of BHowe Plumbing for over 20 years and wouldn’t use anyone else. Thanks DJ. You’re a great representative for your employer!<//text>

We had Bill Howe technicians to help us in assessing  property we expect to buy.  One tech did a survey to detect any leaks in water lines under the slab and two other techs came to examine drain lines and inspect by camera the line that would accomodate a camera.  All three techs were highly professional, efficient, thorough and personable.  I got exactly what I needed and what I expected, and I am a delighted customer.</review>

These folks are simply awesome.  I had a significant backup in my whole house.  Scheduled a call online Sunday night.  They called me on Monday morning to confirm.  As promised, the tech called us 30 minutes prior to arriving.  He assessed the situation and provided an estimate.  He got right to work and the job was challenging.  He had to remove the master bath toilet as well.  He cleaned the areas so they looked like no one had ever been there.  The lines are working great and can't believe the difference.  The tech was kind and professional (I can't recall his name but he deserves recognition for sure).  Given the time and amount of work needed to get this fixed the cost was more than reasonable.  I would highly recommend Bill Howe for your plumbing needs.< /Review>

<time>1536962618479< /time><Text>The installers did a wonderful job, in the dreadful heat on my patio and crawl space.  The lead installer certainly knew what he was doing,  and was so good about explaining what he was doing and numerous times, why it had to be done, which I really appreciated.  But the most impressive thing was that the compressor did not fit through the front or patio doors, and he had to remove both the patio doors, the sliding one and the one that didn't move and was solidly attached.  However, this man figured out how to get it loose, and managed to take it out and got the compressor through.

They also laid drop cloths everywhere and were careful not to get my rugs dirty, and they cleaned everything up nicely when they were done.< /Text>< Pictures>

Consistently the most reasonable prices from the larger, more well known, plumbing companies in San Diego.

Bill Howe Plumbing is by far the very best in all of San Diego.  My water heater went out and flooded my laundry room and when Tris arrived he was not only professional he was so kind and caring.  He cleaned the whole mess up for me and recommended I put in a tankless water heater.  Steven came out today to put it in and was so efficient and professional too.  He didn't leave until everything was to his satisfaction plus he cleaned everything up for me. If you need an outstanding plumber that will not try to take advantage of your pocket book then definitely call Bill Howe Plumbing.  I highly recommend them. Thank you again guys !!<//Text>

Roberto was competent, polite, and thorough. He gets a five star rating. The decrement in score is a result of management’s mediocre customer service. Let me explain. We had a lower level toulet clog that Roberto was unable to clear through the toilet bowl. He then attempted to route the snake through a clean-out located on a lavatory drain. In so doing, he shattered the cast iron drain pipe below the level of the slab. That necessitated a demolition of the slab until “good” pipe could be accessed to complete the repair.  The demo and repair cost an additional $2,200. Bill Howe made no reach out to acknowledge that the project creep was in part due to damage incurred as a result of their repair attempt. I’m pleased overall with the end result.<//Text>

I am incredibly impressed with the professionalism of this company. I could not be more pleased with the service! I called Bill Howe at 8:30am and explained a major plumbing issue that I feared would put me out of my house for days. I was offered an opportunity to schedule an appointment for the 9am to 12pm window for the same day. In less than an hour of my initial phone call, I was contacted by Giovanni who had arrived at my house ready to complete the repair. His availability to work around customer schedules blew me away. He clearly established the project goals, took the time to effectively communicate his recommendation to me and quickly took action to complete simultaneous repairs. After the plumbing was repaired, Giovanni was joined by Alejandro to evaluate the damages. Both employees were extremely transparent about the project’s progress and continuously produced more than expected. I was nervous about having my high-maintenance energetic dog in the house, however, both employees were very comfortable. This is a great company to hire for pet owners.

For a new San Diego resident, the first time contacting a plumber in the area was nerve-wracking. I could not have been any more pleased with the attitude, ethics and results produced by this company.  I highly recommend Bill Howe and especially the two employees who helped me today.<//Review>

They gave me a window of noon to 3pm. At 4pm they called and said that they didn't have a technician that could fit under my mobile home. They didn't say that when booking the time. My daughter took time off work to be home for their visit. I believe that a company should be able to follow through on appointments they schedule.</text>

Bill Howe Plumbing hands down is by far the best in San Diego. The other companies can try to "WOW" you all they want but the only company in my opinion that will truly WOW you is Bill Howe Plumbing. I tried the other company and paid a lot for their work. Bill Howe Plumbing did the rework of the other company with better quality work at a fraction of the cost.</text>

<text>A Very prompt and fair estimate of the air conditioning system I needed.

Office staff was very polite and helpful – especially when I ran into a small situation that they completely supported me on and helped me work through -with an access opening.

JoJo and  Joseph were incredible installers!   They were extremely knowledgeable and competent!  They explained everything they were doing and ask for my input on any questions they had. They cleaned up perfectly – I would never know they were here! I would highly recommend BILL HOWE!  Totally a pleasant experience!</text>< rate>

<Review>Thank you for sending your technician, Chris Sullivan, to unclog my kitchen sink,  He was able to use a "snake" to the main drain outlet and clear the blockage that was caused by an accumulation of fat.  Chris had a pleasant personality and I was grateful for his help and tips on how to prevent a build-up of this nature.  Appreciate your service whenever I send an SOS call your way.</Review>< pics>

Danny and his helper did an excellent and very professional job. They explained what they were going to do and provided an estimate.
They put paper down to protect the floor and made sure everything was cleaned up when they were finished. I would also like to acknowledge the customer service people I worked with on the phone.
My nephew Joe Tonner works for you and always mentions Bill Howe is a great company to work for.

The whole Bill Howe experience was wonderful. We had our furnace replaced and AC installed. Steve the sales advisor was great. Told us exactly what the process was going to be - and we got quite a good deal. The main installers (Jojo and Joseph) were personable and very professional. Obviously this company takes there customer service seriously. I’d highly recommend using Bill Howe. Great folks.< /Review>

<Text>ok, one experience, so that's all I can speak to, that being said...had a leaking copper pipe joint under the house. Tried to fix myself but crawl space was EXTREMELY  small (not enough to turn or roll over, just inch along on back). Pipe was right up against a board, so you couldn't really get to it on all sides. Failed to solder new elbow (drip) and decided to call Bill Howe. Called and got an appointment in the next 4 hours. Technician (Gustavo) showed up on time, listened to what I had ,and what I had tried, and then spent the next two hours in that crawl space (did I mention it was basically all  mud from the leak?) and fixed it in one shot! He was totally courteous and polite. I offered to help, at least with dragging the tools under for him and he was like "no you don't have to do anything, I've got it covered". He came out completely caked in mud from head to foot and goes "I think we got it!" . This cost me way less than I expected, with the difficulty of the job I was prepared easily to pay double. Totally impressed. I will use this company again.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

The redo after 6 weeks was done very well and even found some issues with a video scope. These guys are great, have excellent equipment and know how to use it. I did not expect a "no charge" for this, but they did. I have used Bill Howe for well over 5 years now and have always been well served. If fact, they resolved another company's screw up a few years ago that could have closed off a drain line with a liner. Highly recommended company.< /text>

Don was so patient when he came over to help assess our water. He was patient in explaining the whole process of inspecting the house and drew diagrams for me on how to fix the problem. Very professional, easy to talk to, and doesn’t over complicate things by using lingo I am not used to when it comes to this specialty. He explained everything clearly and it makes a whole lot of difference in understanding how the job will get done. He took his time and throughly and diligently inspected our home. Thank you, Don! You are amazing!</text>

<Text>Had a main line back up in my house I just bought, my home warranty company suggested another plumber which had terrible reviews and didn't call me to schedule so I hired Bill Howe instead.  Tony came out and quickly removed the clog and recorded all my lines with the sewer cam. The company my insurance chose didn't even call until 4pm that day, almost 24 hours after I called them and an hour after Tony had solved the problem. Sometimes it's better to pay out of pocket to just get it done right by a company that actually cares about their reputation for good service than wait for the insurance low bidder. Tony was on time, courteous, and professional.

UPDATE April 2020: Trevor just did an excellent job fixing my supply line leaking under a driveway slab.</Text>< rate>

Hadi the plumber was super friendly and knowledgeable -- ended up working 4.5 hours,  everything got done to our complete satisfaction.

Dan came to my home and I assumed he was going to give me an estimate for a water heater replacement then set up an appointment for another day to complete the work.
NO!
He replaced my water heater within 3 hours!

<Review>I’m visiting my brother from in California and imagine my horror that on my watch the kitchen sink starts to randomly overflow everywhere. I needed someone to come and fix it as quickly as possible. The worker who came out name was John and he was very kind, hardworking, knowledgeable, and informative. He got the job done quickly and effectively. Then he made sure the sink in my brother’s unit was fixed completely, and the apartments above and below before leaving. I would definitely recommend him and his company to everyone.</Review>< userid>

Not true!! Saul Serrano and Dwayne from Bill Howe came out . They went straight to the problem tackling the drain from the roof. Never once suggesting a broken pipe! Always reassuring us that it was just a clog and explaining the difference. Besides being exceptional at his job, Saul is also a very good teacher as he was training Dwayne.

<text>Excellent service. Our water heater started leaking at the worst time possible, and thankfully Bill Howe had immediate appointment availability. I would ask for Doug every time. He called ahead to find out what type of water heater we had, so he could bring one in case a new one was required. Planning ahead like that saved me precious time, and I was grateful he didn't have to make 2 trips. He was courteous and efficient. The type of person that I felt comfortable inviting into my home, which says a lot. He went above and beyond, removing the old wood platform  - he could have just as easily said that was outside the scope of his line of work - but he didn't hesitate to help me out. Exceptional work! Ask for Doug - you won't be disappointed!!</text>< pics>

I have been waiting for months, literally months, for them to finish repairing an AC unit. I've called over and over again - they already took full payment.

I was very pleased with the service provided to me.  Tony and Felipe were courteous and efficient.  They made the immediate repairs, and suggested that I prepare to make other changes in the near future.  There was no pressure whatsoever to do the work then, but I took advantage of their being here to follow through and take care of the issues.

Each time we have had occasion to send for a technician to come out from Bill Howe we have always been provided with excellent service.  This afternoon when Miguel Rodriquez came out to service our water heater, the service was beyond excellent, it was exceptional !!!

My husband and I are senior citizens and probably require a little more patience when being given an explanation. Miguel had that patience. He was polite, friendly,  and a couple times went way beyond what was required of him.

As I said, we are senior citizens and it's important for us to be reassured that who we're dealing with is honest, trustworthy and that we're not being "ripped off". Miguel certainly is that type of person.

Good job Bill Howe in the training you give employees but most of all the type of people you chose to employ.

Pat Mills, a very satisfied customer!<//Review>

<text>Superb company and staff!  Courteous, professional, helpful - they've become my permanent source for any and all plumbing issues. Was referred to their restoration division to deal with my mold issues (caused by Kenmore refrigerator ☹️), prompt, worked quickly, two days with a humidifier in sealed off area which was very quiet; new plastering was so good I didn't really need a paint over. And not a speck of dust anywhere in my kitchen!
Bottom line:  THEY ALL ARE THE VERY BEST!</text><Name>Judy Moore<//Name>< Gmap_id>

<review>Looks like a lot of great reviews here but my experience with one of the plumbers was terrible. He just walked out of our house without saying anything and I waited around for almost an hour. Finally called to ask what the deal was to be met with a response of that he was already done with work and to leave a hole in my ceiling so I can monitor if there is still an active leak. Usually when you complete a job or if there are instructions to provide you communicate with your client. Very unprofessional and quite odd. Again I am only speaking about one plumber so hopefully the rest of the company is alright.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1556325667506, 'text': 'Hi Stefan.

Bill Howe has been excellent. With unforeseen circumstances, the staff has been overwhelmingly helpful and attentive. Marcus Jackson has treated our home and family with the best care. He has made sure to help us in any way we can to be satisfied with their work. He takes his work seriously, and has gone above and beyond to make sure our pipes are their best. We have been so pleased, and would recommend Bill Howe to anyone for their care and concern.<//review>

My water heater took a dump.  I called several places and had 3 estimates.  Trevor came in from Bill Howe.  He was fantastic.  He came in, sorted out the pricing and knocked out the job on the same day.
He worked hard and cleaned up the place at the end nicely. I've been a Bill Howe customer for maybe 15 years now.  I keep coming back.  They run a tight ship and seem to find the right people to work with them.</text>

Great experience with Howe Plumbing!  Relatively simple garbage disposal replacement, but at the initial call was able to a basic idea of the cost of the service, and was able to purchase the disposal I wanted at Home Depot to install separate from the service.  Scott arrived timely, was professional, efficient and pleasant!  In and out in an hour, and now I can once again grind away!<//Text>

<text>I had a disaster in my kitchen. Water poured from under the kitchen sink. I was able to turn off the main water supply and called Bill Howe. They sent Trevor who fixed my leak which was from a bunch st plastic tubing going to the water filter. Trevor explained that he would cap it off for now and that I just won’t have filtered water. He didn’t have the exact part to replace the tubing. Which fine with me because we needed the water turned on rather than have filtered water. He provided excellent recommendations as to how to resolve my problem and that is to use either thicker tubing or a copper one. He was easy to work with and very professional.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1542669628894, 'text': 'Thank you for sharing your experience with Trevor!

<Review>Ron was my technician.  I had discovered a leak of a washing machine supply valve on removing a failed washing machine, in preparation for the new machine.  I called Howe Plumbing and Ron arrived the same afternoon to have a look and give me a quote.  He did not have the parts needed on the truck, so we set up an appointment for the next day (still a day before the new washing machine would arrive).  Ron arrive promptly when we scheduled (early in fact), and completed the work within the estimated time frame.  Ron is a really nice guy, and answered all of my questions that I asked while he was doing the repair.  The repair came out great.  I am completely happy with Ron's work and with Howe Plumbing.  Five out of five stars.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I had a plumbing emergency last week when I was digging at hit a water pipe.  After desperately calling half a dozen Emergency Plumbers, we reached Corey at Bill Howe Plumbing.  Corey listened to my issue, he stated he was available within the hour and showed up to my home even faster than he had initially quoted.  Corey helped me get the water shut off and quickly repair the injured pipe.  Corey is a really kind, honest guy and I felt very grateful that he was able to come help me fix the problem.  Hopefully I will not need to, but I will definitely reach out to this company again should any plumbing needs arise.< /review>

Corey Koenen came to complete the re-installation of the powder room sink. He called first, then arrived and went to work. He completed the installation including replace a drain pipe and supply pipes that had corroded and would have caused a leak. He was meticulous and tidy in his work. He surprised us by also re-hanging the large mirror above the sink. We greatly appreciated his good spirit and experience. He is an asset to the company and we would be glad to have him back when we need plumbing services in the future<//text>

< Review>
Initially I called because of a leak under the kitchen sink which turned out to be a loose connection on the faucet. I talked to Tony about a  drain problem. When the washing machine in the attached garage drained water came up in the kitchen sink. Tony offered to get what he needed and come back and check it out.  When Tony returned he told me every step of what he was doing.  It turned out to be a piece of something that had broken off from inside the pipe allowing only a small amount of water to pass through. Tony was able to wash the pipe out and the drain problem was solved. It's interesting because Anderson's told us the pipe in the kitchen was broken and they would have to dig up the kitchen floor or trench along the side of the house. Estimated cost was $15,000.  I told Tony he was my hero and I would definitely recommend him. If others in your employ are as good as Tony I'm impressed with your service. I'm totally impressed with Tony.< /Review>

<text>At 9:30 this evening, my entire house backed up. After an hour of trying to stop the flooding water and unplug my toilets and showers, I decided to call someone for assistance. As a band aid,  I have turned the water off to my house. I called Bill Howe and was told I would be called from dispatch. After no response, I called another company for assistance. Bill Howe states they are available 24 hours a day but when I finally received a call from someone at 11:25 and the response I received is that their service time is really long and that it was good that I called someone else for help, I have zero confidence that they could help at all.</text>< Pictures>

I'm really impressed with this company. After a minor issue, Bill Howe went out of its way to make things right. It is obvious that this company cares about its customers. We had technicians install new ducts for us, and they were outstanding. They went out of their way to keep us informed about what they were doing, and to make sure we were satisfied with their work. The technicians also made sure that the house was as clean (if not cleaner) after they were done. True professionals. I am very satisfied with their work and would highly recommend this company.  Fantastic Company.<//text>

<pics>None<//pics><text>Our water heater leaked and we needed a replacement ASAP. Having made negative experiences with a plumber in the past, we wanted to call Bill Howe because of the commercials. If they don't know how, then who, right? The lady on the phone who scheduled the appointment was very professional and sweet. She sent Andrew, the technician, out the very next day. He was very kind, knowledgeable, and on time. He worked in a timely manner and clean. We are a small animal rescue and Andrew was kind toward them as well. This was a very positive experience, and we will make sure to recommend Bill Howe because you really know how!< /text><name>Liza San Diego<//name><Rate>5< /Rate>< gmap_id>

Dana deserves the five stars.  He worked hard all day.  He didn't give up when faced with an unexpected challenge; he came up with a great solution and implemented it!  He was polite, communicative, and kept me apprised of his progress as the day went on.

Joel was on time, professional, and quick!  The work looks great!

<text>I would rate this a five star experience easy but I'm picky with that fifth star. That being said I received excellent service and would request the guy that serviced my sink again in a heartbeat. Really pleased with the service I received. The gentleman was extremely professional and didn't break the professionalism but found ways to be personable. He came and we spoke for a short amount of time and he went straight to work. He needed to cut a copper pipe and apologized in advance and I heard less than a minute of sound and it was quiet the remainder of the time. I was working from home in almost the same room and I had forgotten he was there so no distractions. Got the job done in less than an hour. Really pleased.</text><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1517421867069, 'text': "Hi Sean,\n\nWe are so happy to know of your great experience with our technician, John! He is outstanding.

Javier was prompt, extremely courteous and explained everything he planned on completing. His goal was to ensure the immediate problem could be alleviated and then gave me a detailed explanation of what follow up should be considered. I have always had a positive experience when using the services of Bill Howe Company and am thankful I was able to obtain a Saturday afternoon appointment on very short notice.

<Text>It’s early evening on a Friday and there is gross, disgusting water in both the shower and tub and the toilets won’t flush. Ugh!!

I called Bill Howe and the answering service said someone would call right back. He did - John Friend. He said he’d be here in an hour and he was! 10 minutes later, it was fixed. The dogs loved him, too.

The service was great and John was super. Thank you!< /Text><user_id>103324288397017803037</user_id>< name>

He showed and explained what the problem was.  Less than 24 hours I had a new hot water heater installed.  The previous one had been installed incorrectly, so we brought it up to code. Saul was one of the best service technician I've had in a long time!
In the meantime, I had a problem with a furnace that another company refused to look at because of the furnace location.  Saul called Bill Howe AC/Furnace department and Philip was there within the hour.  Within 3 hours he had replaced the defective piece and I now have my heat back on. Philip was sweet, knowledgeable and efficient.  A pleasure to work with!

The entire experience from the first phone call, the follow up calls and technician calls were all very upbeat and professional.  I would call them again in an instant!<//Text>< pics>

<Text>After having our home Termite Tented for 4 days and returning home to a steady leak from our water heater drain faucet, I knew I needed help ASAP. I called Bill Howe and asked for a technician after hours (it was 6pm), and they had one on the phone to me within 2 minutes of hanging up from the call center. By 6:45, Chris was at my door and ready to get to work. He did the repair in an hour and was friendly and knowledgeable. The repair went off without a hitch and we are completely satisfied with the service provided by both members of Bill Howe that we came into contact with. We will definitely be using Bill Howe in the future! Thank you guys!< /Text><GmapID>0x80dbffd6a74d24ed:0xd95f60f86694dfb9<//GmapID>< user_name>

<userid>101073874076959042770</userid><Text>We dealt with 3 water leaks in our property in the past 2 months so we called Bill Howe for various tasks -drain sewage, plumbing, water mitigation and restoration and every single technician assigned to our cases exceeded our expectations.

Like they say, if you take care of your employees they wil take care of your business.  We definitely believe this is true of BH and could see their staff job satisfaction in the way they performed their duties and how detailed they were all along.

Thanks and kudos to the following individuals that through their hard work and sympathy made our life's much comfortable

Danny --back up diagnosis, drain and sewage pipe fix.  It was Danny's great customer service and professionalism what made us trust Bill Howe again for other projects

Cain  --water mitigation.  A one man show. Cain managed to complete and detailed all the demo work quickly and without any help.

Eric --plumbing fix in shower/tub.  Very detailed and excellent communicator

Alejandro --water mitigation.  Came and quickly set up his equipment, completed the demo and left everything clean as if nothing ever happened

John --plumbing fix to repair original house pipes

Moises and Luis --repairs estimators.  Came, inspected the damage and provided detailed estimates within 48 hours.

When you are dealing with an emergency, time is gold and these guys truly understand what clients are going through and go all the way to make the experience a positive one. We DO recommend Bill Howe for all your plumbing and water mitigation projects.</Text><Date>1539374565708</Date><response>{'time': 1539620110815, 'text': 'Thank you for your kind review, Yuli.

< Review>
The project got off to a slow almost a non start, but the other plumbers never called(Repipe) to say they would be late or be a non show. One other Plumber  was late by a day.
Bill sent a young man that just confirmed that I needed a plumber. That was almost the end of our job for Bill.
Then I called and talked to the service desk and told them I needed a qualified person to come out and determine where the slab leak was and that was confirmed by CPL.
Alex came out to ensure the problem and get a Plumbing Tech out to resolve the problem. The piping was complicated as there was not 1 hot and 1 cold pipe, but 2 cold & 1 hot. The cold pipes each branched off with 1/2" pipes. So I opened the walls on both ends according to CPL.
Raul and I made short work of the leaky pipe determination with good conversation and problem solving communication.
A plan was made and Raul went to work and in a matter of hours had the work completed, tested and clean up.
Thanks to all that was involved.
Cost was high for a 75 year old veteran on Social Security, but it was a no choice.

<Text>We've used Bill Howe for years. They are reliable, cost-effective and professional in every way. We tend to have a recurring problem that requires our discharge pipe out of the house to be cleaned from the roof. It's an old house and we just have them come out whenever it needs maintenance. We've been doing this for at least 15 years, perhaps longer. Usually they can get out here within a day without having to incur overtime costs. Today was one of those days. I set up the appointment yesterday and Rigaberto came out first thing this morning,. He gave me a call 30 minutes ahead that he would be here and he was right on time. He listened to what I had to say and went at his business and he was done pretty quick. Thanks!</Text><Rate>5</Rate></record>

Corey came out and talked to my HOA manager before coming up to my home making sure the water was off and was ready to be worked on. He was very professional, explained both valves have to get replaced to make sure the problem was completely resolved. Outstanding service and fast worker. Extremely satisfied with the work and price!</Review>

<review>Michael, the plumber that came to give me a quote was very informative, professional, and courteous.
I approved the work, and he explained everything I needed clearly, also gave me options. If and when I need a plumber again I'm hoping I can request for Michael. He was exceptional!<//review>< Pics>

Bill Howe guys came and did a terrific job with the gas lines under my old house (1920's).  Jerry, Scott, and Brian all worked very diligently to replace the original lines.  Not an easy task due to the very limited crawl space under the house.  They were great!  All hard working, knowledgeable, clean and professional.  Thanks guys!<//review>

Best customer service ever! I had a leak in my kitchen sink and they came out the same day to fix it. After a week I called to see if they could replace the sink strainer for one with a different finish. They came out the next day and Allan (our technician made an additional trip to find a strainer that was the best match). And we were only charged for the part - no additional labor! From the service manager, to the receptionist/scheduler, to Allan (our technician) we were given exemplary service. Hopefully we won't need to call for a repair - but if we do, the only company that we would consider is Bill Howe!</Review>

We found a leak in our main water line and I called Bill Howe. They could not have been nicer saying it might be after 5:00 and also explained prices etc. so helpful and polite. Our technician showed up earlier and completed the repair in timely manner. Thank you for your time, talent and service.

<text>We have used Bill Howe Plumbing for many years anytime we have an emergency plumbing issue, because we trust this company to respond quickly in sending out reliable employees and will give us an accurate diagnosis. Bill Howe Plumbing is the only company we call for help.

Our upstairs bathroom toilet flooded, causing water to flood down onto our kitchen ceiling, causing water damage in both rooms. Within an hour of calling Bill Howe, Carlos Paredes, EMS Lead Technician arrived to assess the flood damage. He quickly found the source of the flood and presented us with a clear water damage remediation plan. We had met Carlos earlier this year when our water heater flooded our laundry room and he was sent out to evaluate the water damage. We knew we were in good hands again when Carlos arrived for this emergency, because we knew him to be trustworthy, he communicated each step of the process clearly in a way for us to know exactly how the damage was going to be fixed and made us feel we were right in calling Bill Howe.

That first day, Carlos began by placing dehumidifiers in our bathroom and in our kitchen to start getting the moisture damage to dry. He explained each step in the plan – cleaning, drying, sanitizing, repairing structural damage and finally, restoration. Carlos then gave us a window of time when he would be returning the next day.

The second day, Fernando M. came with Carlos to begin the water damage remediation process. They called before they arrived to let us know they were on their way and were on time at the beginning of the arrival window. Both men worked very hard in cleaning up both damaged areas to prepare for the encased drying plastic sheeting that would house the dehumidifiers and heat blowers in each room. Fernando first put down carpet and tile protection sheeting to keep our floors safe from all the water damaged debris that was going to be removed. Both men made sure that all areas of the house were protected before the remediation process began. The machines they used were cutting edge equipment for drying and cleaning. When they were done, everything was cleaned up, sanitized and safely secured to begin the next step of drying. Carlos explained that they would be back the next day to take moisture readings from both rooms and to make sure that the machines were working well.

The following day, Carlos and Fernando were on time and quickly checked all readings from the machines. They decided that the drying process could be helped by removing the subflooring from the bathroom, opening more air space for the heat blowers and dehydrators to work more efficiently. After 24 hours, they returned and the drying process was almost complete.

The next step after the initial remediation is completed will be the restoration. Bill Howe will be sending out another team for the restoration. We would like to sincerely thank Carlos and Fernando for their dedicated work ethic, professionalism and great sense of humor. It has been a pleasure working with them and we hope if we need to call Bill Howe in the future, that they are sent out to our home again.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<text>We just had our entire new cut in central heat/ac installed. I am beyond happy with work and service provided by everyone on Bill Howe install teams. I can’t say good enough things from the start to finish. Jason not only was  very helpful during our intial appointment for quote. Jason also answered any questions I had throughout the process. Samuel and his team of installers were awesome completing the entire job. Samuel answered any questions and concerns I had. He made sure to communicate on any issues and what work they were completing. Jose came in to repair drywall from old wall heater taken out and new opened attic space. Jose was great and very professional. Jose patched up all the drywall and cannot even tell there were any holes before. The electrician hired by Bill Howe Mike Kennedy was great as well. He communicated wel and updated our outdated electrical panel and looks great.

Thank you Bill Howe for the great work and service</text>< username>

<Text>Unbelievably BAD experience. I had a simple under the sink RO system to install, so I called BHP. There were two different techs, one's that BHP stated to be their 'experts'  when installing RO systems. Between the two techs, I was supplied different 'tips and expertise' as well as different estimates. Why? No consistency. Shady. During the 2nd tech visit, I was sold unneeded parts as it was stated they were missing from what was supplied. NOT TRUE. I did an inventory of the system before the 2nd tech showed up, since the 1st tech gave me the vibe that I was being taken for a ride. EVERYTHING needed was present before the tech began his work. Furthermore, I was sold 'extra hosing,' but when I counted the hoses before, they matched what is under the sink now - after the install. SHADY yet again. Once the 2nd tech was finished, I was left with scratches across my new farm-sink, and scuffs/grease marks all over the new white cabinetry. Very professional. The last cut came with the supervisor visiting my home to review the work. As you'd expect, he had his company's back, and tried to pawn the fault off on the parts supplied in the kit, stating that it was not purchased through BHP, so that was the issue on why he couldn't help remedy the issue moving forward. Shady yet again. Overall, I am 1000% convinced that BHP is a company that has gained their standing as a 'successful' business through the deployment of dishonesty and upselling at every turn. I will never use them in any fashion again. I believe they are unethical in business practices and this engagement proved that. I would try a different company. There are many in SD that have much higher standards and professionalism. BHP is NOT the way to go.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1570739675674, 'text': 'Hello, may you reach out to the office at 619-245-5469 so that we may look into this further please?'}<//resp>< gmapID>

Great experience all around. I called and was greeted by a very friendly and helpful receptionist, and journeyman plumber Corey K. was at my home the same day to install new valves in our laundry room. It's obvious that Corey takes great care and pride in his work, and he even went out of his way to help me install a new washer and dryer after finishing with the valves. He saw that I could use the help and jumped right in with no questions asked and no extra charge. I would recommend him without hesitation.</Review>

Actually, I'd give the experience 41/2 stars only because it took two days to resolve the issue and not because of any problem with the plumber. Michael showed diligence, professionalism, and perseverance in dealing with our plumbing problem. Michael gets the 5 stars! We're back on line, and I can bathe in my own shower. Yeah!!< /Review>

Marco came out today to replace our subfloor and a couple of posts in our wall. Marco it's a very dedicated employee was here on time and finished in a timely manor. He was very professional and easy to talk with. My husband and I would not hesitate tho have Marco come out again, if needed.</Text>

<Review>Dana came out and looked at what needed to be done and gave me good information.  The next morning he contacted the city for what they needed to do and they came and had everything completed and corrected within 2 hours.  Dana did the jobs that I needed and far exceeded my expectations. Everything in my house is finally back in working order.  Please pass my thanks to Dana on the awesome job he was able to do and on representing your company wonderfully.  Thanks.

Today I had Allen out to help me was a leaking toilet value.  He came out and did the work and get it all fixed very quickly.  Since he was here I went ahead and had him do the same thing to my other toilet.  Allen was very quick and did very good work.  I am thankfully for the service I received today.  Thanks Allen and Bill Howe Plumbing!</Review><Response>{'time': 1501786664374, 'text': 'Thank you, Matthew! Dana is wonderful and will be happy to see your review.

Bill Howe plumbing staff always do a great job at solving my issues.  This time it was unclogging a pool filter input.  Not being something they do everyday they were a bit hesitant but once on site they unclogged the line and got the system functioning better than I've ever seen it.< /Review>

Every time we have needed a reliable and quick responding plumber, Bill Howe has delivered with their competent, skilled plumbers. And Thank You for that!<//Text>< pics>

<Rate>2<//Rate><review>I want to like these guys, because I have heard great things about Bill Howe himself, however I find their service and skill to be average at best and their costs to be on the high side.

I have hired them for both HVAC and plumbing work.

On the most recent exchange I hired them for an HVAC Freon leak.

There are specific machines and tech they could use that would make this a more complete inspection.  The guy they sent was the head of the HVAC department and on top of winning awards in surliness didn’t have any of these tools other than the most basic.  On top of it, their price for 1 hr of work and the guy turning a bolt was $364.  To fill the Freon was another $900.

Long story short I brought in another firm and the whole problem was resolved in 90 minutes at a $120 cost including the Freon.  That’s a 10 times difference in cost!

Also had the same occurrence on a recent plumbing issue.

There also seems to be no customer focused internal team so when asking for better service or prices you run into a brick wall.

Bottom line is if you value time and money you will select a different vendor.< /review>< pics>

<review>Called for service due to a slow shower and tub drain which then turned into a tub leak above the garage. Service was prompt and professional. Would highly recommend to anyone and will call again for future service. Use these folks vs attempting plumbing repairs on your own. So easy and very reasonable pricing for what I had to have done.

The team was extremely professional, prompt, and courteous. They started at 9pm and worked through the day. They ran into an unforeseen snag part way through the job which delayed the work, but requested to stay beyond 5pm to make sure the job was completed and completed correctly. They stayed until 8:30pm and couldn't fully resolve the problem and promised to return and finish. They fulfilled their promise a week later and were extremely thorough to ensure that every detail was fixed. The price was steep but the workmanship and job was completely worth it.</review>

John got here at anticipated time, listened to what I had to say regarding the problem and proceeded to fix it. He ran a power snake into the pipes until he broke through to the main line. He had me pore some "Dawn" into the sink drain followed by a sink full of hot water. When I pulled the stopper, the sink emptied and the problem was resolved. John was here about a half an hour.

Job well done! Thanks,

<review>Six P.M. Labor Day Weekend.  The Best time to have your tenants call you say, Water is leaking from my kitchen and living room walls, I need help!
We called two 24 Hr Emergency service plumbing companies, one did not answer the phone and second asked If we could wait until Monday,  Then we called Bill Howe, and their dispatcher said it would be 30  min until they could have a plumber on site…  20 Min later Michael Plata arrives, and right away we show him where we have water leaking in the kitchen, dinning room wall, and even water running outside the home…it’s night time, and pretty chaotic with our tenants, and their kids, all in gear for the holiday weekend.
While  everyone over 30 is trying to grab Mike’s attention to show him what they think is the problem is, Mike very calmly starts working on finding the source of the leak, and within 20  minutes he localizes the water leak area within the walls, and cuts off the flow of water, and tells us this is just to temporarily stop the water damage from increasing, and since he see this is within the walls, and spilling out to the dining room, he rechecks to be sure that the flow of water has stopped, and with out having every leave the area so he can work, he suggests that we continue with holiday celebrations tonight, and that he would be back first thing in the morning to continue with repairs.     He said this would also save us money since we would not have him working the emergency rates, and that the tenants would be able to get some sleep before he had to begin tearing into drywall to locate and repair the actual pipe damage.
Michael came back, first thing in morning and began to track down the pipe damage and also made arrangement to a water mitigation team begin the clean up process, as he could see this was a bigger job than the owners and tenants had even known.

We are really impressed by Michaels skills in containing and stopping the leak, asd well and his professionalism in creating a plan to make repairs, organize addition staff to work on the water damages, and keeping the homeowners updated on the progress, while even showing concern by keeping the costs as manageable as possible.  Good plumbers are expensive, but cheap ones are much more expensive when they miss diagnose or simply make the wrong type of repairs.  Michael really went the extra mile with us, even checking on areas that were not broken, but were showing wear, and he addressed them so they would not break down in the near future,  on top of that he gave us 12 month warrantee on his work, and was responsive to follow-up even after he was done, and on to the next project.   Mike showed us he was skilled, and that he cared, and that’s refreshing!   Bill Howe has a great asset in Mike, and we’ll be calling Bill Howl and recommending them for all our plumbing needs!   We were truly impressed.  –Steven,  San Diego<//review>< response>

Dana called before and arrived at the very beginning of the time window I was given.  He was very friendly and professional.  Even though more work should be done.  He was able to get everything working for an amount I can afford.  I have used Bill Howe Plumbing for many years and will continue to call them first.

Michael Plata and his partner Ernesto were the nicest  plumbers to help us out.  They were thorough and kept me informed every step of the way.  He explained what he was doing and why he was doing things a certain way.  We appreciate how quickly and hard they work to get our household back in working order after the first attempt to fix the problem failed.   They were very sympathetic and understood how important it is to have working plumbing so they stayed late to get the job done with no complaints.  Thank you Michael and Ernesto you are awesome!!<//Review>

Corey, an expert plumber, was professional, personable, and precise.

My house is in the Serra Mesa and recently I heard of some instances of house pipes collapsing in the area.  A plumber who was doing some of the work on one of the effected homes told me that the homeowner was paying $23,000 to fix the problem.  The plumber not employed by the Bill Howe Co. referred to me to that company as being  reasonable and reliable.
I followed the suggestion and enjoyed great personal service by all staff.  Eric explained to me what was involved in the inspection, cleaning and lining of my cleanout pipe.  They took a video of my pipe to see what shape it was in, showed it to me explaining what the video revealed (3 holes and some cracks.)  Gave me a fair price for the cleaning and repair by lining of the damaged sections.  The cleaning took a day and the lining of the pipe a couple days.
I highly recommend them to any one who needs plumbing work done.< /review>

My water heater died.  I called Bill Howe Plumbing and a plumber (Michael Hoover)  was sent within an hour!   Michael was very personable, knowledgeable, quick and explained everything after he was done. He was very thorough.   I sure appreciate service like this!  I highly recommend Michael/Bill Howe.</Review>

<Review>I had both of my water supply angle stops underneath my kitchen sink leaking. After making an appointment for 2 days later after making my initial call, I was waiting for my technician to show up. As my scheduled appointment time was almost over  I received a phone call indicating my technician was running a little late. John showed up 20 minutes late from my scheduled time and I thought he would be even later after that heads up phone call. I live in a Townhouse and the water supply ball valve is very old and is not a 100% shutoff valve anymore. We shut the water off at the valve and at my hot water heater. He changed out both of my angle stop valves very quickly and he started to get ready to perform a leak test after all the reassembly. The ball valve going to my hot water heater broke as he was turning it on. He changed that out also.

John answered all my questions and was always very courteous and helpful.  Start to finish he was out in under 2 hours, which was very quickly as the amount of disassembly underneath my sink  he had to do to gain access to my angle stops.</Review>< Rating>

<review>Trevor is an excellent representative of Bill Howe.  He was well prepared for his visit to replace my hot water heater .  He asked for photos and details so he knew exactly what he needed to bring.  Then he got on with the job professionally .  I knew I needed a new hot water heater but put it off because I dreaded the process of getting it done.  Trevor made it, if not painless, at least quite doable.  I would use Bill Howe again.  I used them because they did good work for a friend.< /review>< Rate>

Excellent service late on a Friday night of a holiday weekend.
Prompt, and efficient.  Arrived on time and provided excellent service.
The service was on time and the price was reasonable considering I needed their help after hours.
I would definitely have this plumber work on my house anytime.</review>

Could have not asked for a better plumbing to call. After scheduling a service call because our main sewer line was backed up, we were quoted around a 3 hour window.

Josh showed up 15 minutes early, fixed the issue (backed up main line) and gave us some simple remedies we can use before calling a plumber again.

Easy to deal with, prices were reasonable and Josh made the whole process super easy.

Cannot recomend then enough!</text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I can highly recommend Bill Howe Plumbing. A friend recommended this company, and I/we were very pleased with the choice. The house needed total replacement of rusty, galvanized pipes to copper pipes, as well as replacement of the 20-year old water heater. Jerry VanDerham and his crew were very professional, knowledgeable, prompt, courteous, and very efficient; completing the job in just 3-1/2 days! We will use their services again - although we hope to not have a need . Thanks again! Bill Howe Plumbing.

Five Stars to Michael from Bill Howe Plumbing who removed the old and  installed a new Hot Water Heater for us. We are very pleased with his friendly and skilled service. He did it in only a couple hours and left the place in better order than he found it - cleaned up after himself and explained clearly how to operate the newly installed 40 gallon HWHeater. We will shift our plumbing loyalties from a too-busy plumber to Bill Howe.  Great job, Michael!!  Thanks.</Review>

I have to say I’m a very satisfied customer. Eddie, was amazing! He was the ONLY 1 who actually found the problem after 2 other technician checked it. Although Eddie was not the one who did the actual coil repair, Jojo & Joseph we’re very professional, on time, and efficient in completing the task. To top it off, Eddie came by as the guys were finishing the job and checked in that everything was going okay. Thank you Bill Howe for these amazing guys!<//Text>

Javier from Bill Howe plumbing has been out to my place twice to fix plumbing issues & both times he has been extremely professional, quick, & tidy with fixing my items that needed to be serviced.  I appreciate how they give you 3 hour Windows but also call you 30 mins prior to arriving.  Highly recommend Bill Howe plumbing & I will request Javier each time because I know he will do a great job.</Review>

The technician, Eddie, arrived on time and did a very complete check of our heating and air system.  He even made a custom filter for the system.  Our condenser is not easy to get to, but he figured out a way.  We were very impressed by him.  He is an excellent representative for Bill Howe.<//review>

<Review>Had an issue with a broken waste line.  They came out and ran a camera through the line and figured out the problem.  They provided the video and explained the problem.  I was satisfied with the price they quoted to repair the pipe.  They relined the section of pipe that was damaged and it works fine.  Every person that I dealt with at Bill Howe was courteous and helpful.  No sales pressure.  I do most of my own plumbing repairs but would definitely use them again for something that I didn't want to tackle.  Best of all, everything was done either on-line or over the phone which was very convenient.</Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

My experience with Bill Howe was great.  I had a backed up kitchen sink and called after 9p on a Friday.  They sent a great plumber named Jesus right over in about ten minutes.  After that, it only took Jesus about 45 minutes with the snake to fix a deep clog.  Really great service so late on a weekend night.  Big thanks to Jesus and Bill Howe!< /Text>

Jason from Bill Howe did an excellent job installing our water softener and water filter.  He arrived on time, completed the project exactly as estimated from both a cost and time perspective.  The water softener and filter work great and we couldn't be happier with the result.  I would recommend anyone considering a water softener or filter system give Jason a call.< /text>

Matthew was very forthcoming during his estimate visit.  We discussed my options available going forward, and he returned soon to conduct my shower valve replacement.  Once completed, I was pleasantly suprised that he was able to use as few additional parts to keep a clean, solid look to my updated bathroom remodel.  Now my shower head is taller than I am, and I can enjoy a new, upgraded mixer handle.  Thanks Bill Howe for providing professional service.< /Review>

He couldn't have been nicer, more professional, and excellent at explaining what the issue was (roots), and had some good recommendations going forward.  I want to thank the company for being open on a holiday - i think all places should close on Christmas but i am selfishly so glad not all were yesterday!

We have an old mobile home that has very old fixtures and needed a replacement kitchen faucet.  I called Bill Howe and was help immediately.  They sent a person over to assess what we needed, gave me a quote and once we agreed on a price (a little high), Doug began the work. The work Doug performed was great, quick lookd like it will last another 25 years. The new faucet functions as it should and looks great.  I  highly recommend Bill Howe plumbing to any one needing these kind of  services.</Text>

We knew we had leak, but we did not know where it was. We called a knowledgeable family friend who recommended Bill Howe and suggested we explain our problem in detail. We did that and Bill Howe sent us an expert in leak detection and repair, Trevor Mrvich. Trevor finally found the leak behind a closet wall in an upstairs bedroom, pretty far the traces of water damage. He was friendly but determined, methodical, and careful. He repaired the damage at a very fair price. We would recommend Trevor and Bill Howe without hesitation to others with similar problems.

Bill Howe Plumbing was amazing. Raul Miranda came out quickly to diagnose the problem, recommended a leak detection company because we had a serious cold water leak and followed up twice to make sure we got onto his schedule quickly so we could have water again.  We could not be more impressed with Raul.< /Review>

Great experience with the guy who came.  Very knowledgeable.  Assessed the situation quickly and effectively.  Got the work done.  He was very pleasant.  No surprises with the bill.  And he gave us some good ideas for clog prevention, namely, do a drain-cam to see what keeps plugging the drains.  Thanks very much!<//review>

This rating is based solely on a customer service experience I had over the phone with Melissa.  She was very personable and kind and she helped me work through my AC problem over the phone. She answered questions and when she didn't have an answer, she found it and called me back within 15 minutes.  When the time arises that my AC unit actually needs a fix, I will be calling Bill Howe.  My first experience with their customer service was delightful and memorable (and free because she took the time to chat with me over the phone.)  Double thumbs up!< /review>

<Review>So, I walk into my garage to find a large puddle.  I track it to my water heater.  I just thought it was a leaky intake nipple at the top of the tank, which it was corroded stuck and I couldn't get it free to replace.  I called Bill Howe (first time ever ).  The tech (Hadi) was great.  He was straight up and took care of business.  Bottom line, I had to replace my 18-yr water heater with up grades.  Everything was done the same day!  The cost was comparable to other companies I contacted.  So far, so good.  Great service!</Review>< UserId.>

I had a wonderful experience with Tony. He was friendly and incredibly helpful with the problem at hand. He fixed a really awful leak in a matter of 20 minutes. I had spent days agonizing over this problem so I can't begin to tell you how relieved I was by his expertise. He was also incredibly informed about his craft and explained many of the differing plumbing systems in the San Diego area, which was really interested to learn about. I also wanted to thank his dispatcher, Angela, for being very helpful and prompt when setting up my appointment with Tony. Overall I would recommend both Tony and Angela to anyone with plumbing or any other household maintenance need!< /text>

John Friend was a great help in fixing a loose seal problem that we had in our home. John was extremely helpful and courteous service in getting the job done and replacing our cast iron pipe and Falange that wasn’t meeting the floor level and was propped up on 2 sets of beeswax. Thanks John!

I would highly recommend Bill Howe to anyone seeking service with plumbing or heating and air. The service I experience was stellar. The technicians over a three day process were very professional in handling my needs and concerns. A great asset to Bill Howe. Excellent!

<text>Love Bill Howe! They are responsive, timely, friendly, and expert. I needed a leak fixed under time pressure and they called me back when they had a cancellation to get a tech in right away. Josh told me I needed a new faucet, so he came in the next morning to install it while I bought one. This was my second experience with Bill Howe and I'll certainly call them again!<//text><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1486667793123, 'text': 'We are happy to know of your fantastic experience with Josh and our company!

I’ve used this company for years and never been dissatisfied with service or price. Yesterday Chris Sullivan came out to clear my storm drains and he was truly AMAZING. The drains proved to be difficult but Chris never gave up and worked his butt off until they were clear.</text>

The plumber called to let us know when he would arrive and he arrived on time.  Besides just adding the water line for our fridge (did a copper line at that where our other two estimates were plastic flex line) he also took a look at our gas line for hooking up our washer and dryer and gave us blunt advice as what to do.  He also fixed a mistake that the original plumber did when installing our kitchen sink (we bought a flipped house) at no extra cost.  They were also the cheapest and we got all that great service at exactly what the estimate was.  He went above and beyond and will use them again in the future (and the same tech too if possible).</Text>

< review>
I just had the best possible outcome to a very stressful situation.  I had low pressure from the hot water heater, and scheduled a appointment for this morning.  I was the first appointment (yea!) for my technician Miguel Rodriguez.  He called to let me know he was on his way, and showed up right when he said.  He encountered several problems in the course of fixing the pressure issue, he kept me advised every step of the way, and although my budget did not allow all the issues to be fixed today, he was able to fix the most pressing and restored my hot water.  He provided me an estimate for the remaining work to be done and took the time to explain the issues and potential problems they can cause.  He was on time, under budget and the most helpful person I have dealt with lately.  I have used Bill Howe in the past and will continue to in the future as I have always been highly satisfied.  Miguel went above and beyond today and has my sincere appreciation.

Warm Regards,
Betty<//review>

<review>Brian arrived right at the beginning of the three hour timeframe I was given when I initially booked the service, which was great because I wasn't left waiting around.  He was courteous, professional, and when the new parts he installed in the toilet didn't quite work for the model I had, he took some specs and went to pick up parts that would work.  He returned within the hour and installed the new parts quickly, and fixed the leak I was experiencing.  All in all, great service from start to finish!< /review><Date>1511996884729</Date>< Name>

I was most pleased with the honesty shown by the plumber who came out and addressed an issue with the garbage disposal.  He could have easily recommended a new disposal but quickly pointed out that my disposal was newer and just needed a blade adjustment.  I also appreciated his calling me ahead of time to let me know he was on his way. These things one would think would be basic service but there are a lot of guys out there ready and willing to take advantage of customers.  I'm glad this plumber wasn't one of them and I would highly recommended Bill Howe.<//review>

I have been using Bill Howe for several years due to the kitchen sink backing up on a yearly basis.  Every plumber that has provided service has been the utmost professional, arriving within the scheduled time frame,  knowledgeable and very personable.  The fee for clearing the drain is very reasonable; less than I have paid independent plumbers in the past.</review>

Our service technician, Josh, was excellent! He called ahead, was waiting at the house when I arrived, evaluated the problem quickly and went right to work. Within just a short time, he had resolved the drain stoppage problem and restored our house to good working order. Josh was super professional and personable and even loved on our two big dogs who kept pestering him to see what he was doing under our sink. Josh even noticed, when I wrote him a check, that we use a military bank and inquired if we were a military family so that he could offer us the military discount - now THAT is customer service!</Review>

I've used Bill Howe on two separate occasions, and both times they were extremely professional and very good at their craft.

Always arrived on time, very polite, nice and clean employees, very fair pricing and exceptional quality.

Highly recommend</text>

I called Bill Howe Plumbing when I arrived home on an evening flight to find my kitchen, hall and bedroom flooded from a water heater leak. Nate arrived 15 minutes after my call, capped off the water lines, assessed the situation and promptly showed up the next day with my new replacement water heater. His service was timely, professional and courteous.< /Review>

He preformed both the estimate and installation.
When we agreed the work should be done, we set a date and window of time for the work.
Jason kept in contact with me throughout the installation day with his estimated time of arrival, even when he was delayed he was still there within the time window.
The installation went smooth and quick, even with the required attic installation. He even helped me with fixing a broken faucet in the kitchen.
I was very satisfied with the entire process and the heater works great.
Thank you. You made a stressful situation easy.

Unfortunately we had a slab leak.  Technicians Don and Doug came out, re routed the pipes and on fixed all issues.  This was a complex job as the piping seemed to route in a strange way yet they were able to find the right spots, this reduced the amount of ancillary work we need to do..  I would highly recommend Bill Howe Plumbing and the plumbers they sent Doug and Don were great

Great experience.   Ron quickly discovered source of leak and provided an honest opinion on how to treat the main service line.   Will make a future appointment to hydrojet the main line.  Very knowledgeable about pipe configuration within a tight space in the house. Have used Bill Howe for many years for my home and rental property.< /Text>

I was able to get an appointment the day I called, and Marcus quickly narrowed down the location of the leak in my old irrigation system. He returned early this morning to isolate the leak and cap off the old pipe. He thoughtfully installed a valve so that I can install another system if needed. He communicated everything very clearly and worked quickly. This was my first time using Bill Howe and I was very impressed!</Review>< date>

The technician (Raul) went above and beyond to fix a leak in the main water pipe that was totally infiltrated with a tree root. It took him 8 hours, he had to drill through a concrete wall,  and he didn't finish until 9pm. And all with a bright, cheery attitude.

Thank you Bill Howe Plumbing!</review>

Bill Howe did a lining job for me on a very old home.  Mike and the entire team were extremely professional and knowledgeable.  They fixed 110ft of rusted cast iron piping for us.

<time>1565023058348< /time><Rating>1<//Rating><Review>Had my heating and AC unit replaced by this company(heat pump and air circulator). Big job; close to $10k. The unit had to be drained within a month because they didn't do the drainage right or something (this is what they told me). A month later, water came falling from my ceiling (air circulator). Said the installer didn't insulate the unit properly (incompetence much?). City inspector comes the next month. They didn't label anything. Immediate inspection failure. They came and fixed it, but the damage was done.

When I'm paying over $1000, I expect it to be done to right the first time. When I pay close to $10k, I expect PERFECTION the FIRST time. If you have to come back, at all, because you screwed up then that's completely unacceptable.

That doesn't even touch the fact that they screwed up my ceiling's paint job when installing the air circulator and said it was on me to repair it. Never again.< /Review>< Pictures>

My kitchen faucet broke and my garbage disposal stopped working.  I purchased both items and called Bill Howe for a plumber to install them.  They sent out their technician Miguel Gomez.  I was truly impressed with Miguel.  He knew exactly what he was doing, did both jobs in a very professional manner and quickly, with a positive attitude.

<Review>I called on a Sunday because my toilets stopped flushing and the bathtubs were backing up.  Pattric came out within a few hours (he even showed up early because he knew it was going to rain and wanted to make sure he got here before that in case he needed to go on the roof). He was really friendly, knowledgeable and most importantly - fixed my problem in no time at all.  I wouldn’t hesitate to use Bill Howe again and would definitely request Pattric in the future.<//Review>< Date>

I tried to have another local plumbing company come to fix my clogged kitchen sink.  They never communicated that their tech was late, then pretty much were not going to show.  Thank goodness for Bill Howe.  I will never go with another company.  Bill Howe was on it, and called me to let me know ETA on time.  They have made a lifetime customer.  Pricing was not crazy, and they were honest about what the situation was going to be.  It's hard to find good customer care that they represent.</Review>

<Text>Had an excellent experience today as usual with Dana at Bill Howe. This is the second time he has worked with us on different projects. He is an awesome professional and knows what he needs to get the job done. He even noticed a possible gas leak coming from my laundry area and offered to fix that as well. I can't thank him enough. Bill Howe has a customer for life.</Text>< Pictures>

< review>
My wife and I are vacationing in San Diego.  A disabled friend needed work done on her townhouse, so we planned on spending 3 days of our vacation repairing things.  Returning from a hardware store, we noticed a neighbor taking care of 5 French Bulldogs.  The dogs looked adorable from a distance, so we went over to meet the gentleman and his dogs.  As we talked and pet/held his dogs, we shared our story of fixing our friend’s townhouse, which included some plumbing repairs.  Our friend’s neighbor Brandon Pettay explained he was a plumber (working for Bill Howe Plumbing) and could help us should I need help.  Well, when I surveyed the needed plumbing repairs, I had a few questions, so I went over to Brandon’s house for answers.  Brandon patiently explained the systems, steps, and parts I needed to buy, then volunteered his own time after-hours to make the repairs.  What a blessing!  Since we are on vacation, I had access to only basic tools.  With Brandon’s friendly demeanor, expert knowledge and precise tools, he made the repairs while I watched and asked questions.  Brandon, you are amazing and have a heart of gold.  Thank you for assisting our disabled friend with your beautiful act of kindness and service!
Sincerely
David Bek<//review>

This is our second year using Mike Lacey for our building drain cleaning and it is always a pleasure having him here because he is not only thorough but professional as well. He truly puts effort in protecting my residents property prior to starting as well as ensures that units are left as clean or if not cleaner than when he entered.< /review>

<Text>My wife and I woke up the morning of 08/01 to find out that our kitchen sink was clogged on the garbage disposal side. After trying some tricks that did not work I called Bill Howe. I grew up with my parents relying on Bill Howe for all their plumbing needs. I don't use anyone else. The person who answered scheduled us for 11am - 2pm. Tony called me to say he was on his way at 12:30. From the time he arrived to when he left, he was great! Very respectful, clean, and knew what he was doing. Was very impressed by Tony and would highly recommend him and Bill Howe to anyone I know who has a plumbing need. Great job Tony!

Thanks to Corey Koenen for taking the job knowing what time of the day it was.  He was very professional and very knowledgeable to get the job done.  I will definitely contact them for future projects.  Need more personalities like Corey and sevices Bill Howe provides.  Many thanks.<//Review>< user_id>

Bill Howe did an excellent job from pre-Sales right the way through to handling the vagaries of dealing with city inspectors. All the staff where very professional and courteous and kept me updated with status throughout the entire process. The project was completed on time and within budget. Necessary damage (had to cut a temporary larger access hole to attic) was repaired in a timely and professional way to leave the place looking as good as when they arrived. Excellent job!< /Review>

<Review>I had Bill Howe install a tankless water heater back in Oct '08....the guy did a fantastic job in laying it out and doing the work, very impressive. Had them out last year for another reason, the guy did great....then on Sunday past, had a pressure regulator start spewing and decided to try Andersen Plumbing.....great work also, but really pricey.. about 3 hrs after he left, the water heater started leaking, so on Monday called Bill Howe. They sent Steven out to take care of.......he saved me about $2200, so I had him  do some other work....AND still way under what a new water heater would have cost. I am very pleased and have my plumber......Thank You very much Bill Howe.....or hat is off to your service people.</Review><Resp>{'time': 1512602348377, 'text': 'You have described the great service, and we appreciate the opportunity to recognize Steven for his excellence.

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Downtown high rise condo above me flooded my unit. Bill Howe remediation team Fidel & Cesar were exceptional. Estimator Luis was the epitome of professionalism, but reconstruction was stressing me out until I met project manager Jaime. Jaime listened to my concerns, was professional, calm, kind, and relentlessly thorough thru to completion. Jaime and the management team that supported him to resolve every last detail that troubled me were exceptional. My HOA routinely uses Bill Howe for plumbing, but this was my first experience with property/flood damage. Going forward my first call would be to Bill Howe/Jaime.<//review>< Pics>

<review>Our Technician Ron arrived on time walked me through every.step that was needed. As he followed the water leak behind one wall and then into another he was very considerate to me. It's shocking to watch a job getting bigger and bigger. He located the leak, cleaned up the wet and moldy drywall but most of all he made sure I understood what was happening at all times. I would recommend this company. My big tip is to ask for this person Ron. Good luck to everyone going through their repairs.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<review>Once again Bill Howe impressed me. I was given an 8-11 window and the plumber arrived at 7:58. Nate, a young guy, was courteous and efficient and installed my spigot quickly and cleanly. He gave me advice on two other plumbing issues as well. Nate was done by 8:30 and I was ready to plan the rest of my day.
Thanks Nate!< /review>< resp>

We had a mainline blockage at 10pm on a Sunday and so was dreading the emergency call out fees and really the whole process - but we were pleasantly surprised by the emergency service at Bill Howe. Pattric and John were courteous and professional and even tried to be as quiet as possible so as not to wake our sleeping baby. The fees turned out to be less than we've paid for some regular hours call outs. We'd use them again!<//Text>

We've used Bill Howe previously and have always been satisfied.  Honest, local company that stand by products they offer.  Had a mishap while servicing our air conditioning unit which may have been service related or not, but they stood by their word and came back in a weeks time and fixed the problem!  Additionally, they partially reimbursed us for a separate air conditioning purifier/cleaner as promised!  Will continue to use them for any future issues!<//review>

I would definitely recommend Bill Howe Plumbing! We had a late night toilet clog and were desperate for a plumber. Geovanie, the plumber on call, responded very quickly and was at our door within 15 minutes.  He was super friendly, professional, and had our toilet fixed in about 3 minutes with no mess, THREE minutes! For a reliable, affordable, and friendly plumber, call Bill Howe!< /Text>

We had Bill Howe fix our air conditioner last summer during the extreme heat and we were so pleased. It turned out to be a small broken part and the technician was so friendly and knowledgeable. So when our shower drain was running slow, we called again and had another great experience. I would recommend this company to anyone needing plumbing or heating/air repairs.<//Review>

Five stars is an understatement.  John Friend from Bill Howe is a top notch plumber with the problem-solving wisdom, positive attitude, hardworking persistence, and courtesy that define professionalism in his field.  This job was not a quick youtube 1-2-3 fix.  The main problem that unfolded behind the drywall (below our kitchen sink) turned out to be a large drain pipe connected from the upstairs unit in our condominium.  John was well equipped with knowledge and material to remedy this problem,  and he also replaced aging fixtures and hardware that needed attention.  Highest marks in every respect!  Thank you for sending this seasoned professional.</text>

As usual, I had a great experience with Bill Howe Plumbing today.

Their plumbers are top-notch. They are prompt, knowledgeable, honest, and respect that they are working in your personal residence.

Miguel installed our sump pump last summer. When I called because it had become clogged with lawn debris, the company sent Miguel out again. He is both personable and professional--and I was pleasantly surprised that the company made the effort to send the same person to the job.

Thank you!!<//text>

<rate>5</rate><text>Bill Howe has come to our rescue many times - a septic issue, clogged dishwasher, slab leak and most recently replacing a bathtub valve. Each time they have been timely, thorough, pleasant and professional. We learned the hard way by trying a local plumber for our most recent issue a few days ago but led us to needing emergency services on a weekend with Michael from Bill Howe. I will never make that mistake again! We will always use them as long as we are living in San Diego.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Once again we called Bill Howe because we were experiencing problems beyond the previous repairs.  Tony came and checked out the problem and by utilizing the snake cleared the problem.  Tony is very professional and friendly and knowledgeable.   A pleasant experience again.  His represents Bill Howe very well and we would recommend this company to anyone.< /text>

Michael did a great job diagnosing our leakage problem. It turned out that our plumbing was fine, but  water from the yard was entering the wall.

<Text>We have used Bill Howe Plumbing several times in the past, but never for a problem this major (slab leak).  They responded very quickly and diligently stayed on top of the problem until it was fixed - which turned out to be much more complex than originally anticipated and which was complicated by numerous unexpected problems (not their fault, issues discovered during the repairs with the way things were done when the house was built).  Michael Hoover was the service technician - he was great to work with and he persevered until the issue was resolved properly, even getting the supervisor involved at one point.  They were also very helpful in helping us work with our insurance.</Text>< Pics>

I couldn't be more pleased with this company. Not only did they send a specialist (Michael) out to our home after business hours when our water heater broke, this company also had our hot water heater replaced and back up and running within 24 hours of it breaking.  Michael Hoover was phenomenal, he replaced our heater, met with me personally, kept in contact with me and gave me updates throughout the day since I could not be there. I also have two dogs that I locked up before I left for the day so they wouldn't bother Michael while he worked. I received a text stating that not only did I have hot water, but my dogs were also taken to the bathroom and let out of the bedroom. I would recommend this company a million times over. Michael really went above and beyond. Thank you so much, you don't realize how nice a warm shower is until you no longer have the luxury.</review>

After 4 visits I just gave up and decided not to call them back to fix what they didn’t do right the first visit (or the subsequent 3 visits). They charge professional rates, but don’t send professionals to your home. I would never use them again and I wouldn’t recommend them to anybody.<//review>

Brandon and Tony arrived on time as promised, very professional and courteous.

He arrived spot on time even with rush hour traffic.  It took no time at all for him to do the job.  He was very pleasant, efficient, smiling, and did a great job.  Thank you Rigoberto and Bill Howe Plumbing!  This is why I keep coming back to you.<//review>< user>

Our water heated had a crack and was leaking water this morning.  My mother and father had used Bill Howe Plumbing about 5 years ago and they were great ... the engineer that came out was so nice and professional.
This prompted me to call Bill Howe this morning.  It was great to speak to a live person, them have our plumber call us within 30 minutes.  So quick!  Corey Koenen was our plumber and both my husband and I were both very impressed with his knowledge, professional yet friendly, and so very, very polite. He did an outstanding job in our hot water closet.  You can just see his work ethic is 100% ....  he is hard working, goes over everything with you, cleans up when he is finished and took the time to go over our new water heater with us.
Corey Koenen is an excellent representative to the Bill Howe company.  He certainly is head and shoulders above the other plumbers we have hired (not affiliated with Bill Howe) and would certainly recommend Corey from Bill Howe to be your plumber.
Thank you again, Corey.

Regards,
Stephen and Theresa Martin<//text>

<Text>Fantastic experience! Who knew mash potatoes and many other things from Thanksgiving would cause such a sink clog... I wish I had just called them before wasting time and money on Drano and liquid plumber.  The scheduling was prompt and attentive. Our technical Gilbert was on time, dressed far nicer then any technician I have ever seen (shoes, belt, collared shirt with logo and name), was efficient, polite and personable- even was very friendly with my two dogs.  Their services were a great value and I would highly recommend working with them.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< gmap_id>

Was able to make an appointment quickly and my technician showed up in a timely manner. He assessed the problem and came up with a solution quickly and took care of it promptly.

All in all well done, professionally and pleasantly handled.</review>

We had a tree root clogging our sewer line, at a spot underneath our driveway. Two other plumbing companies offered to dig up the pipes and replace the clogged pipes, at considerable expense. Bill Howe Plumbing offered to clear the pipes and install an epoxy seal, without ripping up our driveway, for about 1/2 the cost, and agreed that if for some reason, the epoxy seal couldn't be done, they would match the cheapest bid we had from their competitors. The epoxy seal worked great, saving us almost $2000 in repair costs. The workers came when they said they would be here, and were very courteous and professional, and we were able to see from video that they took that the line is clear and now protected from further intrusions.<//Review>

Terrible Communication. I contacted Bill Howe to come out for an emergency, they did the next day, then late. Plumber Tony was cool. I asked him to have the Restoration Dept call me, they never did. I paid over $530 for snaking and camera, I still have not received a receipt and only an Invoice.  Terrible communication within their department.< /Text>

Clarence called to let me know he was on his way.
He arrived with a smile on his face and before coming into the house he put covers on his shoes.
It didn't take long for him to identify the problem. He even had the part he needed to fix the toilet. Very efficient.</review>

Bill Howe Plumbing ROCKS. Except for one issue, years ago, which was taken care of immediately, we've always had honest, professional service from this company. We live in a 75 year old house, and have had numerous plumbing fixes over the years, and Bill Howe service people have always come to the rescue. Rates are reasonable, no messing around to add additional time to the bill, and all services are thoroughly explained, as well as warnings about future problems that might have to be addressed. Our serviceman today was Giovanny Martinez, friendly, informative, professional.< /text>

Raul from Bill Howe has to be the best plumber I have ever called on. He is a perfectionist, his work was impeccable and he was incredibly neat and tidy. Great workmanship. I had a leak in my hot water line and almost the entire line had to be rerouted but this was accomplished in one day and he did the job alone and all I can say is Bill Howe this guy should be your best paid Plumber because he is incredible, I would have given him a $250 tip if i could have.

Moises Cibrian of Bill Howe Restoration did a great job of noticing the framing sill behind my ship-lap siding had rotted from the plumbing leak.  He recommended replacement of it with pressure-treated lumber before the ship-lap was tacked on.  I appreciate him doing the job right and not causing me other problems down the road.</Text>

I was very satisfied with the service I received from Bill Howe Plumbing recently.  Angela the dispatcher was very courteous and professional and set an appointment for 6-9pm as it was a very busy day. She told me that I would be contacted if a technician could swing by earlier. Tony the technician and Danny the helper called and said they were in the neighborhood and could swing by early. Tony and Danny were both very professional, completed the job quickly and recommended other procedures to prevent future occurances.< /text>

It was probably the best experience I have had with a plumber. He was so sweet, willing to help as much as he could, even helped catch a bug for us. I would absolutely recommend them based on the experience I had.</Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Tony Millan ROCKS, and Bill Howe Plumbing is lucky to have such an experienced, knowledgeable and efficient plumber!  Our washing machine was backing up into our bathtub, signaling a serious sewer pipe problem that required installation of cleanouts as well as grinding out 60 years of calcium deposits.  A previous company had tried, and failed, to resolve the problem by jetting, accomplishing nothing but flooding our garage  and inadvertently causing a serious leak in the wall behind the dishwasher that showed itself as water squishing up between the flooring while Tony was here (thank goodness!).  Of course we were anxious about jack-hammering up floors and such, but Tony guessed the problem was far more manageable, and he was correct!  He and his sidekick for the day, Allen, took care of that, too.  Throughout the process, Tony's confidence, incredible skill and knowledge, combined with his open and down-to-earth personality endeared him to us - Bill Howe, Tony has earned you a lifelong customer here!
Sincerely,

Had a pinhole leak in a ceiling pipe. The Bill Howe plumber was here within a couple hours and fixed the issue immediately. Fast and courteous. All was clean and tidy when he left, and this was messy work (dripping from ceiling, wet dust/plaster). Could not be happier.< /review>

My experience with this company is from the viewpoint of someone who has to resolve invoice issues on a regular basis. The interaction with Bill Howe customer service is always a pleasant experience.  The representatives are kind and they try to resolve your questions promptly and kindly.<//Review>

Very thorough job by Roberto of Bill Howe plumbing. He even came back the next day to make sure the job was completed. Highly recommend as it seems like it is hard to find reputable companies for a home owner to work with these days.

I called and made an appointment and told the dispatcher exactly what I needed (5 angle valves replaced). The appointment window was set for 2-5 pm and the technician shows up at 4 pm. I can immediately tell he does not want to do the work because it is 4 pm. He tries to dissuade me by telling me that after 5 pm it is overtime charges, its late the neighbors will come home etc. I insisted that the water shut off was for that time period and wanted to continue with the work. He then goes to his truck and conveniently he "does not have all the parts"....even though I was very specific when I made the appointment. Complete waste of time. I found a local small business to come by the next day and take care of it.</Review>

Great job, the plumber John showed up on time and saw the problem with in minutes it was old cast iron drain pipe wth a broken p/trap. I can't believe he was able to cut the concrete floor and found the conecting
pipeline which was installed from a earlier remodel from the second bath room. He was very careful not to disturb any waterline. He was able get rid of the old type of cast pipe wich was used back in 1957 and now replaced with new abs pipe. I'm so happy with Bill Howe plumbing that they have such qualified people on their staff.

Happy Customer.</review>

I had an AC unit installed four years ago by Unified Mechanical Corp and it never worked properly I had three companies troubleshoot including the installer that can never figure it out. I finally got the guys from Bill howe to come over and my AC unit finally works properly. I found Charlie (UMC) on thumbtack what a nightmare, HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE AND HORRIBLE INSTALL, STAY AWAY!!! Eddie and Bren from Bill Howe  did a great job installing my new furnace coil and ducting they even added two new registers for maximum comfort. Thanks guys, they know how!</Text>

John Friend was AMAZING! We had unfortunately had a plumber from your company come to preform the task of declogging a drain where our washer was at and left us with the same problem, only difference was he had pushed the problem to the other side of our house. There was sewage in our bathtub and had to call your company back to fix the issue, John Friend made that happen within a hurry, everything is now working properly and i couldnt thank him enough. Although the original issue continued, im beyond satisfied with how John fixed it almost immediately. He even walked us through his work unlike the man who had came before him. Business was definitely kept just because of John. And if you are reading this, i hope you know you made our day! Hope this makes yours!<//text>

I had a great experience with my hvac service appointment with Bill Howe, from setting up the appointment online to the service I received at my home from Enoch Klingbeil, the service representative.  Their customer service was solid and Enoch was very knowledgeable, answered all my questions and gave me input for future considerations that weren't necessary now.  Great job Enoch and the Bill Howe team!< /Review>

<text>Our plumbing technician was Michael Hoover.  My daughter needed a water valve in her laundry room replaced as the old valve was leaking and the water to her condo had to be shut off to stop the leak.  It was imperative that the problem be solved immediately.  Michael arrived at the home a little earlier than our appointment time and immediately started the repair.  The new valve was installed and tested to our satisfaction.  Michael was professional, courteous and, competent.  My daughter is expecting her first child at any time now so, you can imagine the emotional trauma she was experiencing because of the water problem.  I can say that we are all very happy with the results and now have someone to contact if we ever need similar services.< /text>< Pictures>

We have used Bill Howe on a couple of occasions and would highly recommend them. Overall, they provide excellent service, take time to explain the issue and are so courteous and professional.

The first time we needed a plumber was when our upstairs bathroom plumbing in our first home began leaking into our downstairs. After contacting 2 other local plumbers who tore a HUGE hole in our ceiling and charged us hundreds of dollars without even successfully repairing the issue we were fed up and were looking for someone who would guarantee their work. So... we contacted Bill Howe!

Bill Howe was able to come right away and they actually had all of the parts with them which was so nice since the previous plumbers had to keep leaving to get different parts. Plus, the plumber form Bill Howe was so nice and explained everything he was doing and actually left us with guarantee/warranty on the job so that if we had any other issues we could easily call them back out free of charge.

We actually never needed the warranty though because they completely resolved the problem in just one visit. We still own this property and the repair they initially made 3 years ago is still holding.

Now that we are in our second home, we contacted them a couple months ago when our kitchen sink began leaking. Once again, they sent someone right away who was also super nice and explained everything he was doing. Literally, within 10-15 mins our sink was like new and the plumber cleaned up after himself.

We've had such a great experience with Bill Howe that we honestly wouldn't even consider another company for our plumbing needs. They are fast, efficient and so nice to work with!< /Review>

<review>We needed a plumber for both our toilets. One was leaking and the other stopped flushing properly. Christopher (Tech 686) came to provide us a quote. It was reasonable. He helped us change our wax ring on one toilet, and then instead of replacing the inside parts of our second toilet, we had him replace with a new toilet we purchased. He explained that we also had a 15 year old water hook that needed an update too. He was kind, courteous, and he provided a thorough job. He consulted us on what other water services Bill Howe offers, such as, water pressure gauge services, water heater replacement, and shower plumbing, etc. I’d definitely call and use Christopher again. Thanks for the plumbing services and advice! He said water spreads faster than fire! So I learned don’t let a water leak happen.</review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I've hired Bill Howe for two listings for cigarette smoke smell removal.  One home was a gut/remodel brand new inside but the cigarette smoke kept creeping back through the walls.  We had the ozone treatment run twice and it was noticeably better after the second treatment.  The second time the damage was isolated in the garage and after one treatment it was perfect.  Be aware neighbors will be alarmed because no humans can enter during treatment.  They put up yellow tape across the door warning do not enter.<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>Roberto from Bill Howe plumbing responded to my service call for a plugged toilet in one hour. He augered it out, and it works great. He made no mess, and was very professional. He didn't charge me anything above the service call fee of $99. In addition, he consulted on my problem with a washer that backs up, figured out what would solve that problem, and set a date with me to come back and fix it. I highly recommend this business!< /Text><Date>1527978802333<//Date>< resp>

It's great to know that in the modern-day race to the bottom there are still honest, reliable and professional companies (and technicians). We have Old Republic Home Protection policy and when our AC unit failed (in the middle of July heat) we had Old Republic send out 4 different technicians to fix our unit. All of them said the system was "too complicated" and they didn't know what was wrong. I finally did a little bit of my own research and found Bill Howe. The reviews were fantastic, but having already dealt with four different technicians I was skeptical. Bill Howe sent out a technician for a free (yes, free) diagnostic. Mike Reif (the technician) was on time, professional, polite, courteous, and figured out the problem in less than 2 hours. I was shocked. Having now had experience with Bill Howe (and Mike Reif specifically), they will always be the first people I call, and the first people I will recommend to friends and family,  with any heating or cooling issue. These guys know what they are doing and will patiently explain everything to you without trying to gouge you on the price. Definitely a five-star experience.< /text>

Just had a regular service checkup on my furnace, performed by Enoch from Bill Howe. In addition to the servicing and cleaning, I was recommended a purge protector and UV cleaner/sterilizer. Enoch fitted them both quickly and with minimum disruption. I have used Bill Howe for a number of years and this is the most recent of many great interactions with their staff.</review>

Recently, I had a serious problem with my master bdrm toilet with roots. I called Bill Howe and was lucky enough to have Ron as my technician to come and take care of it. This guy ROCKED!
The thing that I appreciated most was that every time he entered or exited my bathroom he changed the booties he would where in the bathroom while working on the toilet. He explained everything he was doing and answered all questions fully. Even what most would consider dumb questions. :)
When he was finished he made sure that everything was cleaned up and ready for use.
The cost was well worth every penny!
I would strongly recommend using Bill Howe and won't hesitate to call again if I have any other problems in the future.
Thank you for being a GREAT San Diego based company.
Sincerely,
Shawn Torgerson<//text>

Alex and his crew did an amazing job. From the walk through for bidding to the completion of the work, everyone on the crew and office team was professional, timely and pleasant to work with. This project was to re-route the plumbing in a 40 unit 2 story apartment occupied apartment building. What could have been a nightmare for the residents during this process wasn't. Alex had daily communication with the office on the status of the project and times of water shut-offs so that we could prepare the residents. Over all the project was complete on time within 30 days and we received little to no complaints from the residents.

I would highly recommend Bill Howe, they handle everything for my San Diego Properties from a single plumbing repair, extensive slab leak repairs to re-routing the plumbing on an occupied apartment community.  Thank you doing an amazing job!< /text>

My guy was on time, polite, tidy and very patient with the big mess we had.  He was thorough and found reasonable solutions for our THREE leaks and improperly installed water pressure valve (not installed by Bill Howe).  He even hauled off the ancient non functioning water softener we got with the house.< /Text>

I needed a replacement for my heater.  I called Bill Howe and they promptly fitted me into their schedule.  The person who arrived,
Laurence C. thoroughly tested my furnace and pointed out the problem.
I decided to replace it.  They arrived on the day to install it.  The two men,
Jose Gomez and Javier Diaz promptly went to work.  They were clean, efficient and respectful of my home.   I would gladly recommend
Bill Howe for your heating and plumbing needs.  They were great!!<//Review>

He explained the problem and was great!!!

I had a great experience with Bill Howe Plumbing! I came home today to  backed up drains in showers and sinks. I called in a panic and spoke to a helpful girl named Kayla who really put my mind at ease and said someone would be able to come today and gave me a 2 hour window. Louis was the plumber who showed up and he was awesome. He came on time, was nice,and professional. I expected it to take hours and cost a bunch, but he was done in 30 minutes and price was more than fair. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. Thank you!!!!< /Review>

We had a water leak in our kitchen and Danny did a great job taking care of everything to insure we were safe. Water leak damage is never a good thing, but Danny made it as stress-free as possible. Great customer service. We will be repeat customers, for sure.< /Review>

<Text>If I could give 10 stars or more, I would.   I had worked on our sink for a whole day and some (plunger, snake, Drano, hot water, etc.).  I finally realized my limitations, and on a recommendation from my sister and a ad in our church bulletin, I reached out to Bill Howe.  I was soooo surprised how quickly they were able to send one of their technicians (TONY MILLAN) out to fix my sink.  Not only was he quick in coming, he was very cordial, explained what would be entailed with the work, and how much it would cost.  No sooner had he gotten on our roof, the blockage was cleared and life returned to normal.  I now know that if I need help in the future, I can count on Tony to help us out.  I would also like to make a shout out to dispatcher ANGELA for sending out Tony and keeping us abreast of his arrival time.  THANK YOU TONY & ANGELA.  For those searching for a plumber, please go directly to Bill Howe and ask for Tony/Angela.  You will definitely be in good hands!!!!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><UserId.>115827953868064623137< /UserId.>< Gmap_id>

Mike Reif arrived on time, was very professional and educational with diagnostics on our A/C, gave us a fair quote and recommendation.  He arranged a replacement appointment as soon as was possible.  Samuel & Yons, installers, were able to install 3 days sooner than expected, and it was a wonderful experience.  They were very professional, explained what they were going to do for the install.  Worked in an efficient manner, cleaned up as they worked, they were very polite and their work showed that they knew what they were doing.  We enjoyed having Bill Howe Plumbing fix our A/C.</Review>

My water tank burst in my garage and flooded out my garage. I immediately called Bill Howe Plumbing and these guys showed up on time and were right on top of things. The people I dealt with were Tris, Luis, Ricardo and Moises were extremely kind very professional. These guys made my nightmare situation a very pleasant one. I hope I never have another Plumbing problem but if I do I know exactly who to call, Bill Howe Plumbing.<//review>

Bill Howell Plumbing came to the rescue when  flooding occurred in my home. They were very professional,  documented everything for insurance and did an impeccable job through the demo work and reconstruction.

Really poor. I told them the name of the equipment that was faulty, we set up an appointment, I take the afternoon off work, and near the end of the allotted time window they call to cancel saying they don't deal with that equipment provider (the name of which was provided days before). What a waste of time.<//Text>

We called Bill Howe about a plumbing leak and a very professional young man named Allan came to fix our problem.  My husband and I were very impressed with his knowledge, his efficiency, and his skill in solving the problem.  He was on time, on task and very pleasant to work with.  Thanks, Bill Howe, for having such an excellent representative on your team.< /review>

I could not have been more pleased with the responsiveness, considerate employees, workmanship, and follow up.  We used three divisions of Bill Howe when we had a flood due to a water heater/T&P gauge, Plumbing, Remediation and Reconstruction.  They communicated among themselves which is really important in terms of getting a project done smoothly.  It was timely, reasonably priced and finished with attention to detail.  Patrick and Renee were exceptional in empathizing with the homeowners headache and emotional turmoil of everything being torn apart especially just as we were beginning to decorate for Christmas. Ashley in the office was always polite and responsive and we could not have been happier under the circumstances.< /Review>

She found all of my personal account information right away and then set me up with an appointment WITHIN THE HOUR!!!

I had some questions about the epoxy lining that BHP offers and instead of trying to answer questions that she wasn't familiar with she transferred me to Melissa.

Melissa was terrific as well!  She was responsive, patient and gave me great information. She also told me that she would send out a more experienced plumber to address my problem. I'm so thankful that she took this extra step for me.

Our plumber, Mike Hoover, came over immediately, donned foot booties to keep our place clean and diagnosed the issue without a single cut in the wall.
Mike gave us his recommendations and suggested we call our contractor to have him come back and resolve the problem (we have rusty water coming out of the shower).
This all happened with no charge!!!!

Anddddd, this is why we have used Bill Howe Plumbing for many years, not only for our personal property but for our homeowners' association too.
The whole process was very simple, smooth and professional. We can't thank you enough!< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1511301072077, 'text': 'Thank you, Susan!

I can’t say enough kind things about the people who work here. Everyone I spoke to was pleasant, knowledgeable, and helpful. Dashawn, who was asssigned to come out, is an excellent technician and human being. I had a slow leak at the base of my toilet, so he came out to replace the wax ring. He was very respectful of my home. He immediately noticed that we leave our shoes in the entryway and made sure he had protective boot covers. He also had some interesting tips on how to keep kitchen pipes unclogged, which I am looking forward to putting into use.

As Dashawn was getting ready to lift up the toilet to replace the wax ring, he discovered a leak from a corroded connection and fixed that. After several tests, it appeared that this had actually been the source. It seemed like the   fixed  problem without needing to address a more intensive wax ring issue.

About eight hours later, I discovered to my distress that while the connection was the main source of the problem, the wax ring had also been leaking at a very slow rate. I left a message with the after hours dispatchers, spoke with the emergency tech, and they left excellent information for the day dispatcher, as we all agreed that didn’t require someone to be out at 10:00 at night.

The next day, Dashawn took it upon himself to talk to his manager, explain the situation, and arrange for me to only pay the materials fees for the second visit before calling me. He was extremely sorry that he was unable to catch a hint of the secondary issue, though it took a very long time for it to develop. It manifested so subtly that I would not have noticed it until the next day if I hadn’t been on hyper alert from the earlier trouble.

He took the time to figure out how issues specific to my bathroom might have masked the secondary problem and addressed them. I couldn’t be more grateful.

I completely and wholeheartedly recommend Dashawn and Bill Howe plumbing.</text>

<Text>It was Christmas Eve and as fate would have all our drains were backed up. I tried a few things with the help of my neighbor. In the meantime my wife made the decision to call Bill Howe plumbing and they said they could be here in about 30 minutes but it seemed more like 15 minutes when Miguel showed up. He went to work immediately and had the main line unclogged in no time. Miguel was very helpful and very professional.

Steven and Shaun replaced our tankless water heater expeditiously, and with apparent pleasure considering that it was raining most of the time. Nice guys and good work...no, EXCELLENT work. We have never been disappointed in Bill Howe Plumbing.<//text>

Had been fighting bad clogged disposal for 2 days... used baking soda + vinegar many times... no luck!
Called Bill Howell today, Tech arrived promptly, went to work. Rico had never seen brand of disposal so no key underneath - No problem.  He went to work and under 25 mins, clean disposal, clean sink, clean dishwasher. Problem Solved with big smile and small cost!  Even my big Doodle dog was impressed!

2nd time called Bill Howe, 2nd success story w/ no fuss, super attitude & great pricing for budget. Why would anyone call another company??  Save the angst and get Excellent Service every time. Thanks Rico, thanks Bill Howe! I’m a Believer!<//text>

My service technician Gabriel was friendly and knowledgeable, he explained the process and told me how long it was going to take to get a tankless water heater, water softener and filtration system installed, though it took all day he managed to get it installed earlier than he mentioned he also made sure that everything was working properly and explained how to operate the system and what also need to be done and what the systems will be doing at certain times. I’m definitely happy so far and will call BHP for future jobs.</review>

<Text>I met with different plumbers and they recommended tearing out all my old cast iron pipes from under my slab foundation. Which would have been very costly and would have meant ripping out my flooring, bathroom tile and fixtures, cabinetry, etc. Bill howe inspected the pipes and recommended a less destructive fix. A few days later my pipes are relined instead of replaced and we are happy with the results.
I would definitely recommend Bill Howe.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Text>It was great, came soon because I told you I peed in a bucket outside all night. The sewer line was clogged and Clarence got it unclogged soon. Toilets working again and washing all the towels I used to clean up the water.
Clarence is a joy, could have taken advantage of a widow as others have done, but he didn't. Good job. Don't take your toilets for granted, appreciate them, a marvelous invention.

I have used Bill Howe Plumbing on several occasions over the last 10 years. I'm always pleased with their service.

Today I had a 5+ star plumber named Marcus. He arrived on time, was very friendly, courteous, and professional. He quickly and efficiently got the job done (unclogged my garbage disposal and shower).

I definitely recommend Bill Howe.

I'm updating this review. Unrelated to the last issue I had, my garbage disposal needed to be replaced today so I called Bill Howe plumbing again. The technician sent today named Rudy also deserves 5 stars. He explained everything throughout the process of diagnosing what the problem was to the best way to maintain the new garbage disposal.<//text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>I needed a major/total re-plumbing of my 60+ year old cast iron sewer system and an epoxy relining from the foundation to the City main. The team of Pattric Nealey and Will Connally killed it. I am usually a "passed or failed," (met my expectation or failed to meet my expectation, kind of client) In this very rare case I am giving this work crew five stars, they actually exceeded my expectation. The relining team of Jesus Bustamonte and Kevan also exceeded my expectations. The job had some difficult twists but Pattric & Will overcame these twists. They were there  on time everyday and put in 9 hour days everyday. They also cleaned up everyday and keep the street and sidewalk clear and safe for my neighbors. During the week a personal friend had a plumbing issue, me called me and asked if I was satisfied with Bill Howe, I said yes. He called Bill Howe and they responded the same day to fix his leak. He called me back and said he was very happy with Bill Howe's response. This was a major job and and was not cheep. I obtained 5 estimates for the job. Pattric did my initial inspection/evaluation, pointed out things that needed attention and made it happen. He was there for every turn of the wrenches. I felt I got my monies worth.

I woke up at 5:30am to clogged toilets and showers with 3 house guests. Of course... couldn't be better timing. But no fear...I called Bill Howe and was greeted by a very pleasant operator who took my information and had the scheduler call me when they opened. Also, a pleasant experience. I was given a hour window and Dashawn was on time and showed up with a smile. He took a look around and got right to work. He took time to explain what he was doing and even went over all of the preventive things we can do to prevent clogs in the future.  The issue was in the main line and it took a bit of hard work in Dashawn's part but my drains are clear! I can tell that Dashawn is proud to work for this company and truly wants to help people get through a not so pleasant situation. I had a wonderful experience with Dashawn and Bill Howe as a whole and will certainly recommend them to anyone in need of their services!<//review>

Alan from Bill Howe did an absolutely excellent job replacing my old water heater. He came up with a solution to pipe it because my house is so old and my pipes were at an odd location which I extremely appreciated. I've used Bill Howe before for a drain clog and that technician was awesome also, so they do have an excellent workforce that provides excellent service for a extremely fair price. They also take care of us veterans, I highly recommend them!!< /Text>

< review>
Attempted to be my own plumber but was unsuccessful. So I called Bill how plumbing. They were able to schedule me the very next day, it was not an emergency. And they arrived exactly as promised on time. When the plumber look at my situation he saw that there was really nothing else he could do he just explained what parts I needed and where I could get them and explain how I can do it expecting to pay for at least a service call I was surprised when RJ said there would be no charge. I have used Bill how plumbing in the past, and I've been very satisfied which is why I called them this time. I continue to be very satisfied with Bill how plumbing I will continue to use them whenever I need a plumber.</review>

I requested a quote for a furnace replacement and for AC installation. I had Steve Tehrani as my service consultant. He was very thorough and informative which was very important for me. He was straight to the point, had a great attitude, and answered all of my questions.<//Review>

Saul did an excellent job repairing our broken bar drain. It's been broken on and off for a year and he was the only one who figured out what was needed. Most definitely recommend Bill Howe and especially Saul!< /review>

<review>Late Tuesday my old water heater failed spectacularly. Wednesday morning I read reviews and promptly called Bill Howe for an inspection. Gustavo came out, prepared with a 50 gal unit that I had specified earlier and proceeded to explain everything including installation to bring it up to code. I agreed and by 5:30pm had a beautiful new water heater installed. Bill Howe and Gustavo made the process quick and painless. They have earned all of my future plumbing needs. Thanks guys!< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

I don't normally do review's but I wanted to for Bill Howe plumbing. I've used them 3 or 4 times over the years and have always had good experiences with them. The operator on the phone was very friendly and helpful. Our plumber "Rigo" was so nice and did a great job with getting our backed-up system going again. He explained everything he was doing and what future steps we might need to try to prevent this from happening again. I would recommend Bill Howe Plumbing to any one who needs plumbing work done. Their prices are very reasonable too.<//Text>

Great customer service, Victor came in with his little boot protectors to protect my rugs. Which I could appreaciate not a fan when other technicians come in with muddy boots in my house.

<Review>Very unprofessional, Don came out and was on his phone the whole time. Mind you this is a facility for adults with mental and physical disabilities, this man was smoking cigarettes and flicking the butts into our lawn. By the end of the day he completed nothing, we had to go elsewhere to get the issue squared away while not ever getting refunded. Called to talk to the owner about the issue and was blown off.. repeatedly. Definitely an issue for the better business bureau.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

We had a severe blockage in the pipes that was causing sewage to back up in the shower. Bill Howe arrived within the time frame provided. Giovanny was great; very friendly, professional, and polite. He and his supervisor were able to remove the blockage which solved the problem. Thank you Bill Howe!</Review>

Called Bill Howe after having a 2nd issue with a backed up laundry room line that was also causing a secondary back up at my kitchen sink (same pipe line). ProTec Building Services refused to stand by work performed only a few weeks ago, said no warranty, and wanted to charge me again. I chose to pay someone else instead. Javier came out in a few hours and had us good to go within an hour at half the price of ProTec!  30 day warranty for cabling also. Looks like I now have a new plumber. Thanks for the great service.< /text>

<text>Steven from Bill Howe Plumbing came out to estimate, then was hired to remove old water lines then relocate and replace new lines under my house. He was smart, clean, polite, and very conscientious about closing the gate so no dog escapes. The quote price and timeframe was identical to another local plumbing co, so it seemed reasonable and fair. The work was doneand area cleaned up on time, and all for just under the estimated job cost. Highest praise for great work and customer service from Steven!< /text>< username>

Over the past 5 years I've need plumbing service more than 10 times and use a few different plumbing companies. Today I went with Bill Howe Plumbing. OMG, what a difference. A true professional technician showed up within about an hour. He was very personal, showing me tips and tricks as he solved the problems. From start to finish it was a pleasant experience. I highly recommend using Bill Howe Plumbing and would like to thank them.

Rudy (tech #442) was professional, friendly and thorough in his work today.  He definitely earned 5 stars.

When one solution did not solve my problem, Rudy tried another, until he resolved my clogged drain.  And the job even cost a little less than quoted because of his change in attacking the problem.  He also suggested a strategy to treat my drains so this doesn't happen again, as well as a long-term solution.

Kudos to Rudy!  He has my gratitude for a job excellently done.</Text>< pictures>

<text>Bill Howe Plumbing worked on a really knotty problem for us (including the structural lining department). I know from experience that it would be difficult to find ANYBODY who could field a problem like the one that we
had,  but the Bill Howe crew handled it with skill - and even good cheer.< /text>< pictures>

<Text>So happy with my decision to go with Bill Howe!  My sales person, Mike Reif, was great. He was very professional, answered all my questions. He didn't mind coming to my house three times to go over all the details. I did my homework... Mike and Bill Howe were my best choice!!

Jo Jo and Joseph did the install. Took about 8 hours. Jo Jo explained everything, vacuumed up and did a splendid job overall. Plan to recommend Bill Howe to my son in North Park! Thanks BH!!!< /Text>< Pics>

<Name>Brian Dunlap< /Name><Time>1424198608179<//Time><Rating>1</Rating><Review>So, I own a small shop here in Pacific Beach and called what I thought was, 'The cities best plumber,' only to find out that I was going to get royally ripped off. All that I needed done was to have my drain snaked, it tends to clog b/c we work in a historic building and I need to get it done about every two months, simple right? The first gentleman that showed up wanted something 'Free' just for showing up, I should have called someone else at that point. He proceeded to snake the drain, write up my invoice, accept my payment and leave, only for me to find out an hour later that he didn't do his job and the clog came back. Again, I should have called someone else at that point. After speaking with their customer service rep (these women are amazing), a technician was scheduled to come out at 830 pm (an hour after I close), but I waited. And at 8.30 pm, the technician showed up STONED. The only reason I know this is b/c I was smoking with my boy and we offered, he turned us down b/c 'he was already high'. Again, I should have called someone else at this point. After about 20 minutes of running cable a loud 'SNAP' occurs. This is the technicians line snapping my drainage pipe. He proceeded to explain to me that b/c my pipes were old, we ran a risk of this happening when he was running his cable. Mind you, this was never brought up in the initial consultation, earlier that day.

So, it's now been 5 days, Bill Howe has not corrected their mistake. They are now attempting to charge me to get the issue resolved (time and a half b/c they would be working after 7 pm) and I still have a backed up and broken drain system in my shop.

Please explain to me Bill Howe, how you can send an intoxicated technician to fix my issues and then attempt to charge me when your stoner employee breaks my piping?<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1424978834954, 'text': 'We worked over the course of several days with our field supervisor and senior technicians to make extensive repairs to the line at no charge.

I had a sewer lateral break open 90 year old cast iron line I was going for major surgery in one week and needed to do something fast.  Although I normally get bids for a big job like this (the concrete in the city's right of way needed to be opened, requiring four different permits), I simply didn't have time.

Bill HOWE is a large company with the licenses, knowledge and resources to marshal together the companies required to do this job (traffic signage and barricade), shoring (steel plates), excavation and restoration, concrete, and, of course, plumbing.

I worked with Hector and Jesus and they were, at all times, professional. The job was done exactly on the dates that they indicated and all city inspections were approved without a hitch.
I had the line on my property (my rental unit) back up twice during this time (not related to the break) and they stepped in and took care of these problems quickly (one clearing was done at 10:30 pm)

Although I cannot speak to the competitiveness of their price, they took care of me when I needed it most.  I would highly recommend them.< /Text>

We've used Bill Howe for years. From the unexpected (a clogged drain) to the really unexpected (a 70-year-old sewer pipe collapsing) to the complicated (a bathroom remodel with state-of-the-art system), they have come through every time< /review>

Giovanni was professional, honest and trustworthy. I watched every move he made as he tried vigilantly to unclog the main. He found the clog and cleared it out  but unfortunately it now needed to be repaired. Roots and rocks were clogging up the main and I'm happy for us that we can now use our plumbing but we now have to fix.  The estimate was $1200 and we will make our decision tomorrow after we get another estimate.  If I use Bill Howe plumbing I would request to have Giovanni come back out in the event we needed your services again. He's a man with integrity, diligence and kept his composure as he persevered through this job.  It was a physical job as he had to snake, dig and use the sewage cam to get to the root of the problem (no pun intended).< /text>

Requested them to bid on a job. Scheduled for early am. They called just before the appointment to move to a time slot that pushed them into the afternoon. Offered many excuses. Worker called back and showed an attitude. We expect basic follow-through and respect for our time. Guess who didn't get the contract?</review>

NOT EVERY PLUMBER IS CAPABLE.  An important lesson i learned.  Without hot water or heat for my 5 and 3 year old, we got a referral and called the pros at Bill Howe.  Doug came out the next morning and in less than 30 minutes, not only diagnosed the problem, but spent the rest of the day fixing it.  I'M SO HAPPY I CALLED THESE GUYS!!!  All of the other plumbers said they would need to cut out dry wall and do tons of patch and repair all over the house.  Doug did the troubleshooting and cut 2 small holes.  In my opinion, this saved me a TON of money.  These guys are truly the best!!<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<review>Bill Howe Plumbing has done an excellent job in taking care of the sewer needs of our 1953 home.  Originally, they were called out to handle a "spill" in the front yard of the house that we had just purchased.  They came out right away and took care of the immediate problem.  They then cleared the roots from the sewer line that caused the problem.  Now, about a year later, we finally did the liner in order to keep the roots from coming back!!  The team of Zach, James and Melissa worked around our schedule and got the work done in a timely manner.  My family is so happy to have our sewer problems taken care of - really happy!!</review>< GmapID>

We had yet another great experience with Bill Howe! There was a scheduling conflict and they were able to get someone to our house in 15 minutes! Marcus fixed the clog in our drain and did it with a smile!</Text>

Last June 2015 fixing a bath tub leak and retiring the tub took 1 and a half months, not showing up for three days , lying about when they could get it done, forgetting to turn back on the water to the house three times, and installing cracked tiles and then not wanting to replace them.  He said he thought i wanted  "the rustic look" Today they were supposed to come to fix the faucet because it's still under warranty,  and again they no showed with no call.  Horrible service.

<text>Bill Howe made a horrible experience into a great day.  I bought a Sears Kenmore garbage disposal for my rental unit; their installer showed up but wouldn't install because there was a rusted sink drain nut and he wasn't a plumber (?!).  I called Bill Howe Plumbing; Eric showed up, did the repair and installation, but then, the new Kenmore disposal was defective!  Between Eric the plumber and my tenants, everyone agreed Eric could show up the next morning with a new disposal.  He showed up and finished the job as promised.  My tenants are very happy.  I'm very happy.  Thank you Bill Howe Plumbing.  :-)<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Our labor rate for this job was quoted at $450 (2.5-3 hours) and the part is covered under warranty. The original call that was scheduled even states the warranty so the technician would know to not charge for the part. The customer was unhappy with our hourly rate and advised us that she could find it cheaper. However, she still wanted us to take care of getting the part. We happily ordered it for her and are still waiting for it to arrive. We have addressed how to improve communication in the future to avoid any confusion, but feel we went above and beyond in trying to find a happy resolution, including obtaining the part under warranty for another plumber to install.\n\nBest-\nBill Howe Customer Service'}< /Response>

A very bad experience not recommend. Say and do are different thing charge terrible service $450 for two hours to repair.
Last week my water heater was brook. I called them come to checked the leak. The representative said. They won't charge first visit for the inspection.
The guy come see and said the unit out the warranty need to order the part will be $450. He order it for me.
Next day I called the water heater company directly. They said to me you are unit still under warranty. You just pay for the labor. So I called back to Billhowe Plumbing explain the all detail,  and why lie the unit didn't uncover and why charged $450. They representative said and change the story , we charged first visit and charge $150 an hour. That is why charge $450. Never ever call they again.

Next day a local guy called recommend from water & heater company. He help me fixed it only charged $75 an hour. He just charged $150 for two hours.</Text>

Hadi came in on time,  and he was very patient to solve my problem.. I have a very big problem to my laundry room,  and everyone came in would said that design was crazy, no one would want to fix that for me bc it was really difficult to fix.  But Hadi was really friendly and tried every possible way to solve the problem..  I really appreciate his work and hardworking..  Highly recommended!

Thanks again,
Theresa</Review>

<review>Our technician Hadi did a fantastic job. I'm blown away. A repair job (water hammer) I thought might take days and thousands of dollars to fix only took an hour and a half and just over $300.

Hadi was very friendly and courteous with my wife, and efficient as well. I would 100% choose Bill Howe again and request Hadi if he is available. Great great work.< /review><Rate>5</Rate>< Pics>

They confirmed and shut the gas off at the meter. Next step, called Bill Howe Plumbing. The next morning I got a call from Corey Koenen letting me know he was from Bill Howe Plumbing and was on his way. Upon arrival he gave me his business card and started asking all the right questions. Corey assessed the situation and went to work. He kept us informed as the job evolved. On day two Doug and John arrived with Corey to assist in digging a 20 foot trench. On day three the city inspector came and signed off the work. A few hours later Corey finished the job. I called SDGE and the gas was turned on and appliances lit. We are very pleased with the results and the professional manner which these young men performed their duties. Corey is the type of person you want working on your house. He is knowledgeable and confident and able to the get the job done quickly and professionally. If he is representative of the men and women Bill Howe hires, this company is in good hands.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<review>We had a pipe burst in our bathroom on a Saturday night. Bill Howe arrived promptly fixed the leak and then began the dry out and demolition the next day. Joseph led the demolition team. He was always prompt ,courteous, professional and communicated well with what he was doing and what he would have to do. Joseph also met the needs of my 89 year old mother who uses a walker and myself. I just broke my ankle using a cane and wearing a boot. He made sure all the fans, blowers and electric cords were safe for us to maneuver around. Bill Howe made a very stressful situation much more tolerable.< /review>< Pics>

I always get the best service from Bill Howe.  I have a service agreement with them for my HVAC System and they come out twice a year to do service, change the filters, etc.   This last time they were even early for the appointment, and the tech called when he was on the way to make sure I was home.  Thanks again guys!<//text>

We have certain protocols in place as a safeguard when snaking drains. There are certain circumstances where we need access to ensure the drain was snaked properly, to make sure that the blockage isn’t just getting pushed into their unit, and it protects both of you.  Also, I have spoken to my manager and we will be doing further training with our technician in regards to customer service. We have been in business because we truly care about our customers and doing the job right. I do apologize that you are unhappy with our services and hope for another opportunity to regain your trust in our company. Thank you for your feedback, as it is truly invaluable to our growth.\n\nBest - Stacey'}</resp>

This was the worst service! Kitchen sink was clogged, contacted our property management company and they sent someone out from this company. The man that came out was named Jeff, he was not very nice, took a shop-vac to our sink and told me that he couldn't fix the issue since the clog was past our unit and he did not have permission to enter the other residents home or garage, didn't even attempt to snake it, said he would not be able to. Next day called my property management again and they sent someone from a different company Affordable Drain Service Inc. They were able to fix the issue in 10 mins and were able to snake it from our unit, there was no need for them to go into someone else's unit or garage. Very disappointing, when this clearly was an easy fix.</review>

Very poor communication before, during and after appointment with camera inspection. Basically, tried to sell me a lining that I didn't need. Ask to talk to someone and after the second visit to my  home discussed how the city needed to be informed but that a Plumber's report needed to be filed. Never got a call back and i had to ask what needs to be done every step of the way. Since I was not interested in a lining, my calls were not returned and my $300 for inspection cost me weeks of confusion and will not be calling Bill Howe again.<//text>

Bill Howe Plubming, specifically Dana P (Journeyman Plumber extraordinaire), is the only plumbing service I would recommend. Not only did they come back to fix an issue previously attended to, they corrected the problem at no charge even though the damage occurred because of me! Customer service goes a long way...will use them in my home as well! Call Bill Howe Plumbing 800-BILL-HOWE - they DO know how..<//review>

5 stars to Bill Howe and their HVAC division! I installed ductless splits in my house - I do not have central heat so opted to install the Ductless system and it is FANTASTIC! The units are super quiet and so far they are keeping the house extremely cool throughout. I also had a great experience with the installers -  Samuel and his partner were so communicative with me the two days they were in my home with everything they were doing. From placement of the units, asking me questions, making sure I knew what was going on and making sure I was happy. Samuel deserves 10 stars. I have never used Bill Howe for HVAC only ever plumbing in the past and as a reference for my real estate clients of 15 years.  I will definitely recommend the Bill Howe Family Company now for both Plumbing and HVAC needs my clients have! I am very happy. And not hot any longer :) Felicia Jerbasi</review>

Bill Howe's plumbing tech cleared 2 of my drains in 20 minutes for 86.00. 2 days before this I had another company come out and they wanted to break up the slab under my tub for a cost of 6,000.00 to correct the issue. Thanks to tech Shawn.< /Review>

We are new to the San Diego area so my son-in-law said to call Bill Howe.  Hadi arrived on time, was very pleasant, and worked all day to solve various plumbing nightmares including leaking faucets, replacing an old water heater and a whole house water pressure regulator. Hadi checked and rechecked all the connections  to make sure everything was tight and drip-free.  I was very pleased with the service and my wife and I will call when we need any other plumbing problems solved.<//Text>

Called on a Saturday, made appointment right away. Victor called right on time and arrived at my house at the time we agreed. He went to work right away, found the source of the leak within minutes.  Was behind a wall, knew the most likely source and found it on first try. Replaced a valve part, done in an hour. Couldn't be happier with Victor and Bill Howe Plumbing.<//text>

Well at first when I called in & told the guy my situation he said he couldn't get anyone out until the next day. I was like what I have 5 kids no way that would work. My husband called back and was able to get someone this morning after speaking to the lady btw (ladies rule). They sent Brandon to me who was nothing but AMAZING!!!! He fixed our back up issue in a matter of minutes. He was very friendly and so helpful. We have been getting service from Bill Howe for years now and could NEVER go anywhere else. Thank you for the GREAT service you provide every time!!!< /Text>

The entire company was amazing from the beginning to end. We were referred to them by our own tenants, since the previous landlords used to work with them, and they were able to locate the prior work done for our property with no issue. They even had a specialist out to check on our sewage leaks the very same day. Although he could have done the work that same day, he was courteous enough to warn us of the evening/overtime fee, thus saving us a lot of money! He was also kind enough to schedule us for the very next morning and worked out a schedule directly with our tenants. Overall, our experience was incredible. We're very happy that we made the choice to work with them!<//Review>

The plumber from Bill Howe was on time, professional, courteous and did a great job installing a new sink in my bathroom I'd recommend BH they always send someone right away and know just what to do.<//review>

<user_name>Lynn Owens< /user_name><date>1489424036853</date><Rating>5<//Rating><review>We use Bill Howe for all our plumbing, heating, AC issues on both our home and rental properties. Their hourly rates are higher but they give us accurate info, unlike other companies we've dealt with. We had a supposedly clogged drain that another company was going to charge hundreds of dollars to clear. Bill Howe happened to be there working on a different issue, and their tech tested it for free and cleared it in 10 minutes for free. Another time we had them check gas lines and again, they said no work was needed. When we had them replace a blown-out motor on an AC system, they did a thorough job and took time to teach my husband, in detail, how to clean the filters so the problem wouldn't recur. A year later, at tax time, I couldn't find the receipt so I called their office and, voila, they located the receipt and emailed it to me in less than 5 minutes.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

I called in a panic and 60 minutes later the plumber arrived exceeding my expectations! Jimmy was very helpful, fast and knew exactly what to do. My panic was over.

Another plus -- they warranty their work for 30 days. If my drain plugs up again -- I just call them and they come out for free. Although with the job Jimmy did, I don't expect any problems.  I would definitely contact them again with any plumbing problem.<//review>
</record></dataset><record>
<text>On Sunday afternoon, a toilet, sink and tub suddenly wouldn't drain but the nearby fixtures, closer to the street, were okay, so we knew we had a clog.  Plunging was ineffective, since it just sloshed the collected water back and forth.

When I knew I'd need a professional, my first call was to the number for Bill Howe.  The operator said the plumber would call, which he soon did.  Jesus told me where he was and estimated the cost, based on what I told him about the problem.  He arrived ahead of schedule and used a power snake through a roof vent and reached the clog in a few minutes of carefully easing the snake into the drain.  (old house wants to be treated gently.)

He inspected under the house to make sure that the pipes were still in good shape (Yes) and packed up..  The final price matched his original estimate, minus a few bucks for the Senior Discount;  thank you very much for that.

This is not the first time we've had Bill Howe rescue us.  They'll be the first call, again, next time we get in a jam.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< gmapID>

<Text>This company is a rip off!  I called for a plumber a little over a month ago because my toilet was leaking from the base.  It just needed a new seal under the base of the toilet so that's what the plumber replaced (half hour of work and $150 later), okay it's fixed that's all I cared about.  Conveniently 39 days later (the warranty is only good for a 30 days) it started to leak again.  I called Bill Howe to come back and see what is going on since it shouldn't be the new seal that was just replaced.  They failed to put a Big enough seal that was tight enough for my toilet, in MY OPINION this is the plumbers fault for not fixing it correctly the FIRST time.  Instead, I got a "you are out of warranty since it's been over 30 days" and I had to pay ANOTHER $150!  Not even a "I'm sorry I will get you a discount since the wrong size was put in"...nothing but another bill for the SAME PROBLEM.  I will NEVER use Bill Howe again, what a disappointment since I thought this was a reputable company.< /Text><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1424106909862, 'text': 'We attempted multiple times to connect with this reviewer after her initial review on Yelp in October, and then again in December and offered a full refund regardless of warranty.

Just had Giovanny here from Bill Howe plumbing.  We had a clogged toilet/showe/drain that we had plunged/snaked already.  He took my word for that (didn't re snake it etc wasting time), went straight to the roof and snaked the main branch.  The plug was 30' down.  He was finished within the hour meaning it didn't cost too much, which was great!  Giovanny provided excellent service, really nice, friendly and professional.  Thanks!</text>

Justin was absolutely wonderful, he was the best service person i have ever had! he was polite, friendly, helpful and informative. He addressed all my concerns . If I had a  company like yours, I would steal him away and hire him! You should give him a promotion !  I have a non related company but I know how hard it is to find employees you can trust and who take pride in their job and at the same time are friendly and care about the customer. He is a rare find. I hope you treat  him well. I felt compelled to send this note because I recently hired someone to remodel my bathroom and they were grumpy , rude and they did a slopy job, He was so rude i was even scared to complain , so when Justin came to unclog my drain, he was a breath of fresh air to have him do the work !!  By the way on you scale from 1-10 you dont let the rater know if 10 is considered the best so I am telling you that I put 10 because for me 10 is the best</Review>

<review>BH seriously changed our feelings about homeownership and plumbing.  This time, Giovanny and John came to trouble shoot our leaky toilet and backup and pulled out a tree root when a warranty company's plumber told us the problem was something else.  If we had not consulted with BH, we would have spent the money and not be able to address the problem.  Sarah at the office had been great too.  We have used BH all things plumbing and have through this ideal dealt with the remediation team who also did an excellent job and at a competitive price.  God forbid we have to remediate again, we will absolutely use them.<//review>< Name>

Bill Howe just installed a new Lennox HVAC system in my home. I am extremely pleased. My sales expert, Bruce Brunk, and installers, Brian and Rickey, were professional, friendly, knowledgeable and highly skilled. Bill Howe's price beat all competitors. I did a lot of research before I made my decision to choose Bill Howe. I am confident that I made the right choice. I highly recommend them.<//review>

<Review>Be careful of 5 star reviews...  I have used Bill Howe for many years.  Always professional and fair price -- job done properly/to my satisfaction.

This time around I was traveling, my wife called another company for a plumbing repair, my fault for not letting her know about Bill Howe.  My wife is smart enough to use Yelp reviews, found a company (Courtesy) with 5 star rating, came to my home and fixed the problem, professional, nice guys -- challenge (problem/issue) was their pricing for materials, appeared to be VERY high.  But it was a situation that i had to fix immediately because water was leaking from my main line outside my home.

While at my home (via phone) I asked Courtesy to check a second problem, a leaking gas pipe feed to my pool, they came back to my home today, once again very nice guys, professional, dug around the pipe to expose to find the leak, could not find, recommended i get a leak detection specialist -- which is ok.  The challenge was the price for materials quoted, just way too high (given my experience remodeling many/multiple homes).

I thereafter called Bill Howe Plumbing, Jessica (Howe) answered, asked me to email a picture of the job so they assess -- a 5' feed from the flex to the meter.  I emailed the picture, followed up with Jessica, and to my amazement 15 minutes later I got a call from Bill Howe himself.  I explained the situaiton, Bill was extremely patient and professional, I asked him what he would charge for similar materials.  He explained materials (a 90 degree transition sweep) could be a different brand from Courtesy, but his price for the materials would be 'no more than $250...' (vs. $500+ for Courtesy).

I was a bit curious so I called a couple of plumbing supply stores, received a price of $175-190 over the phone, each store confirmed a contractor/plumber would get a discounted price.  So at the end of the day, Courtesy was charging a 400% mark-up for materials.  Great (nice) guys who get fantastic yelp reviews, make like they're your honest buddy, but really 'stick it' to us with overinflated material costs, and hopefully you'll all now know better -- Bill really 'knows how'...  And be very careful when you read 5 star reviews...<//Review>< Date>

Had tankless installed outside to replace my old 40 gallon water heater . I requested Jason the tec I used before and he was the tec for this install and did an excellent job. I Like the fact that this is low profile water heater and no more big tank. He removed the old tank and metal case and also took it away which made it easier for me.< /Review>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Review>Giovanny (no last name given) was my plumber from Bill Howe.  He was prompt, professional, courteous, and got the job done.  30 day guarantee. It should be noted that Bill Howe's policy is to charge a bunch of extra money to take off the trap if they are rootering your kitchen sink, when it takes all of a minute and a half to undo those fittings.  That is a rip off in my opinion, does NOT reflect badly on GIovanny, and is the only reason i did not give 5 stars for this review.< /Review>< pictures>

We recently had issues with our HVAC and on the recommendation of both a neighbor and co-worker decided to call Bill Howe. We were very skeptical and concerned about getting "ripped off" to put it mildly after several bad and costly experiences with other larger and supposed reputable companies.

Boy, where we ever surprised!! The technician who serviced our unit was nothing short of fantastic, professional and honest which is hard to come by in this industry I have learned. I did not feel for a second we were being taken advantage of or that he was in any way trying to "up-sell" us, there was no panic mode and he spoke to us not like we were dummies but rather explained everything so that we were able to make an informed decision on our mess of an HVAC unit.

I would highly recommend this company, not just because they are local and its always good to support the local businesses but because honesty and professionalism is pretty darn hard to find these days and these guys have it!!</text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>I have SO MANY POSITIVE THINGS TO SAY!! My challenge will be in being Concise!:) I'm not one to write feedbacks (I'm just not good at taking the time to do so-- this is already a week late!)  But THIS TIME I Absolutely Had Too!! I had The BEST Experience with Daniel H. the HVAC Tech which until last week I didn't know what HVAC even Meant! I had just purchased a condo, and couple days in, a small but Definite STREAM of water began POURING from my CEILING Switch?! I had NO idea who to call (Normally it would be my Land Lady!) SOO I went to Yelp, and Bill Howe had the Best Consistent Reviews AND NOW I KNOW WHY!!
Normally I feel uncomfortable when Strangers enter my home to work on stuff but Daniele was So Nice, Professional AND SO INCREDIBLY INFORMATIVE!! I felt Completely Comfortable,  I even Sat there and observed and asked questions, and He didn't seem to Mind One Bit!! The Opposite, He Explained SO Much. Another thing, there was ZERO PRESSURE. It was Obvious I was Clueless about Everything,
I asked if things needed to be done that weren't 100% necessary at that time, and He explained exactly that!! THAT right there, Speaks VOLUMES!!!! I was in a venerable position, It was clear I knew Nothing!:) I had purchased a condo with problems that weren't disclosed to me, But This Visit Renewed my faith in People:)) When You're in a scary or venerable position, it makes Kind people/gestures stand out that much more.  He earned my Trust and Since He's a representative of your Company, then I trust Your A Good Honest Reputable Business.
That's NOT a Reputation easily Come by you know, where you can TRUST the person coming into your home to be Incredibly Competent, and to give Honest Advice. He Even Drew Me a PICTURE so I could Fully Understand what was going on!!! And when I offered, he wouldn't even accept a Tip!! He said he was just doing his Job!! I appreciated Everything he did, I honestly just can't say enough.
I'm a nurse, So I know the value of Good Customer Service. Also, we have this thing where we strive for the "wow" factor,  Well, He Earned it!!:)</Review>< pictures>

<Time>1557927888282< /Time><review>Twenty five years owning and managing rental properties has given me some experience. When a freind asked me to take a look at a bill that seemed high I agreed and called the company to ask about it. The bill was for $800 to "run  camera and a jetter to remove roots in main line", twenty feet. After being told several times over three weeks that someone would call me back I finally asked for the general manager, John. John first told me that I would have to sort this out with my friend because that is who paid the bill. Later in an e-mail John told me that what had been done was not jetting but de-rooting and that it was "totally different", that it was done by quote only and had "NO SET PRICES". When I ask other companies about removing roots in a main line they say they use a snake with a cutting blade, around $200.<//review>< Pics>

Thanks for reminding me to get everything in writing before allowing any work to be done! I was told roughly $300 for 1.5 hours of work and parts. Your employee completed the job in well under an hour and still quoted me the same price even when he admitted he worked for 30 minutes less than he quoted. If an hourly rate applies then it should reflect in the final cost! I’m sure if it took two hours the bill would have gone up. In addition, nobody called me 30 minutes prior to arrival. The plumber said “the office usually handles that.”
After I took time to call the office, almost $70 came off the bill.</text>

Josh saved the day at the office today! We had two bathroom drains that got clogged up somehow. They share the same line with the one in our kitchen. One got really bad and most of the floor got wet. Josh came in and tackled the problem and even cleaned up the wet mess we had going. He took down our out of order signs and everything was back to normal. Thanks Josh and Bill Howe!</Review>

ETA:
I appreciate the willingness to communicate to resolve the issues and send someone out the next day. We still value the work that BH does and will call again in the future. Thank you Julie.

_______________________________________________________________________

So disappointed to be writing an unfavorable review for Bill Howe. BH has been the ONLY company we have called over the past years and we generally have had excellent service.

2.5 weeks ago we called to have a drain cleared. The tech came and although I told him the problem was in the bathroom (after all, we had this service performed many times) he said that he could fix the problem from the main. He did not come inside and clear the drain, he snaked the main line. We decided at that time to have the cast iron pipes replaced under the house the following week. The tech showed up on the Monday to work (by himself after we were quoted the job with 3 people), the first day he cut through our hot water line, which necessitated a master plumber to come out and fix (while our job sat on hold). The NEXT day he hit our main line while digging, which, yet again, necessitated another master plumber to come fix, while our job sat on hold yet again.

Fast forward to today, where our bathtub drain will not drain. I called first thing in the morning to schedule a technician to come out and was given a window between 10am and 1pm. I was also told I *might* be charged for the visit. At 1:10 I called because there was no one there and we received no call. I was informed that the tech was on lunch and it would be another 40 minutes before he would be at our house. We could wait no longer so I expressed my frustration and asked to reschedule, and was given YET ANOTHER 3 hour window the next day to sit around and wait.

So BH has been to our house 3x in the past 2.5 weeks, our problem is NOT resolved, we get stood up for an appointment after waiting all day, and we are invited to KEEP WAITING. Seriously disappointed.<//text>

On time, agent was friendly and knew exactly what the issue was and completed the job within an hour. And my issue was a garbage disposal with a leak. After replacement, he gave instructions and information about use - what to do and not to do. Not your TYPICAL plumber. Thanks Bill Howe and your team, especially the one sent to my house.< /Text>

< review>
We recently experienced our water heater failing on New Year's Day at our home, not a pleasant expereince by any means. I called on that Sunday (further complicated by the fact that Monday was the observed holiday) and was contacted by Marcus Noble, a master plumber from Bill Howe.

With virtually no one open on Sunday and Monday they were able to understand our home, specify the proper tankless unit and on that Wednesday Marcus arrived and over the course of the day executed an extraordinary installation that was flawless.

He was a true professional and took the time to do every step of his craft with perfection. It was a difficult installation of Rinnai's new tankless with a built-in recirculation pump. Marcus not only was a master plumber but left no detail unanswered. While working in one area of our garage, he treated the space as if it was in the living room of our home.

I don't normally 'post' but this was a remarkable expereince and I would recommend the company and Marcus to anyone in need of this type of service.<//review>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><text>Shame on Bill Howe. I decided to call this company because my neighbor recently needed their services and recommended them. I needed their services on a sunday so I'm talking to one of their techs and he is telling me he is on "overtime".  I asked the tech what do you mean overtime. He says on the weekends the techs are on overtime so it  costs more for a tech to come out, almost double. Ahhhh, another scam to nickel and dime the customer.  I told the tech that the overtime has nothing to do with me, you can have your overtime and shove it. Bill Howe, instead of gauging the customer on the weekends, why not hire temps just to work on the weekends. OVERTIME! You gotta be kidding me! Lol.  Luckily I took the time to figure out the problem and I fixed it myself. If this is the norm of this industry, shame on those who practice that Overtime scam. Another money making scheme!!!! The American way is to scam the customer!!!!!!</text><time>1474938886685</time>< userid>

<Resp>{'time': 1474991938609, 'text': 'Thank you for your feedback. After 5 and on weekends, we do charge overtime (time and a half)  rates as our emergency crew is working 24/7. We do ensure that we quote customers over the phone so customers can make an informed decision. Our family owned company is built on honesty and integrity which is why we quote beforehand. Additionally, we hire and train all of our plumbers/HVAC technicians to protect our customers with qualified employees who undergo extensive training, background checks, and receive excellent benefits so our customers know they are taken care of, and in turn our team takes care of our customers. We do not hire temporary employees.\n\nWe appreciate your feedback, and are always looking for ways to improve.\n\nBest - Stacey'}< /Resp></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Bill Howe's technician Michael Hoover was on-time, courteous, and professional throughout the entire replacement of my leaking gas water heater at my rental property. After the remediation crew was done with their restoration repairs, Michael followed up with me on installation of new heater and completed the job within the timeframe promised. Thank you Michael :)<//Review>

<resp>{'time': 1415729889354, 'text': 'Our technician had been in touch with the owner and was told it was not an emergency and to reschedule. However, there was a disconnect between owner, technician and tenant and we immediately alerted the owner once we discovered what had happened, and we also left  a message for Melinda  to reschedule, but did not hear back. Over the weekend, we have emergency technicians but limited access to records and this was the unfortunate result of miscommunication that we attempted to resolve.

<Review>As with my prior contacts with Bill Howe Plumbing, the time until a plumber came to my house was within a day or so.  The plumber called when he would be early.  He fixed my problem immediately.  He was early, friendly, professional, and a joy to have come to help me.< /Review><username>Michael Rummel<//username><gmap_id>0x80dbffd6a74d24ed:0xd95f60f86694dfb9</gmap_id>< Pics>

Our technician arrived at the beginning of the service time window and installed our new bathtub faucet and shower head. He was very professional, wore a face covering the whole time, and polite. He recommended and emailed a quote for some future work that needed to be done.<//text>

<Review>I would have rated 5 stars for the fast response time, quality of work, competitive price, knowledge and ease to deal with. Unfortunately the final bill was $150 more than quoted because two additional flexible copper lines were required for my new water heater.

I find it a bit hard to swallow considering i sent pictures, at their request, so they could provide me with a quote w/o sending someone. The pictures were clearly showing the top of the old heater (rigid copper pipes) so they knew the flexible copper lines would be required for the new one. They had no answer when I asked why the quote missed it.

I doubt they try to rip off customers but these mistakes always end up being paid by the customer. Disappointing. 4 stars.</Review><rating>4<//rating>< user_name>

This is another one of over 100 fake negative reviews posted about us since October 11, 2020.\n\nWhichever person or company is doing this is copying negative reviews from other places on the internet and pasting them into newly-formed Google accounts with fake names.  Their intention is to defame us and lower our overall rating.  Please look at all of our negative reviews in the past six months and you\'ll see that all but three - which are from real customers of ours - fit the same pattern of general criticism of our customer service, pricing and/or technicians\' quality.  Not one of them mentions anyone in our company by name because they are not actually about the Bill Howe Companies.  If the complaint about us is legitimate, we absolutely follow up with our customer directly and make things right.  You will not see this message if the complaint is from an actual customer.'}< /response>
