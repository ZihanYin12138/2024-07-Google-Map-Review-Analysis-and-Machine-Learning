The ladies at the salon are so sweet and professional.  I made an appointment for my mother and myself and we were greeted and seated immediately after checking in! The pedicure was the best I have had and exceeded my expectations. I will certainly be returning as a regular customer for all my nail needs!</text>

<text>Horrible experience... the first guy who did my nails made them incredibly lumpy and uneven... I am not a picky person so I was not going to bother saying anything and just deal with it... But then he added a yellow oil to my white nails which died them and ugly yellow color. So I then had to come back 2 hours later and waste more of my time getting them fixed by Lisa who did the best job that she could but now they are so brittle and thin. They didn't even last a week before chipping off of my nail...
Then the manager apparently commented on my original review  saying that I could call him to discuss it further, but has not returned my call... I also payed FULL PRICE FOR THESE HORRID NAILS!!! WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.< /text><UserId.>112566280533984185474<//UserId.>< Resp>

I really like this salon, but don’t use the ATM machine they installed. The machine charged me $1.50 to withdraw cash which was fine, but they also charged my checking account an additional  $2.00 without my knowledge or consent.
I called my bank and they said there’s nothing I can do about.  It seems illegal to me😡< /Review>

Lady said I had black dirt along my nail. After I got home, it was still there on some of them. I injured my wrist and wanted a beautiful manicure before I went to my daughters. Sad to say but looks like I never went. To spend that much money for bad results. My daughter even mentioned that my fingers have black in them. Not very happy with my visit at your shop. I thought I was walking with clean beautiful nails. That's not the case, it was a horrible job. I have never wrote a bad review about anything but this really upset me.</text>

Julia did a good job on my nails. However, the staff tries to take shortcuts. We went in for a deluxe pedicure however they gave us a regular pedicure but still charged us a deluxe price.My friend went for a full set to another technician and the nails were horrible and looked like bubbles. We had to come back again to have them fixed.
If you want to come to this place, watch the staff to make sure you are getting the correct services and check the nails at every step.< /Text>< pictures>

Haven’t been to a nail salon in a few months due to COVID19. But Jade Nails is now open and doing business outside. Been living here since February and I was worried about not finding a good salon. I love the outstanding service from Jade Salon. This will now be my salon 💕. And I looove my mani/pedi!< /text>

<Review>This place is horrible. I called today to make an appointment for Wed and I was speaking to the supervisor and I asked him if they can please see me sooner as last time I was there I had to wait 45 min and he got very offensive and said he was not going to schedule my appt and then hung up on me. I called back and I asked for his name and then he started to get aggressive and started cussing at me and hung up again. I have been coming here for over a year and I will NEVER come back here.</Review><date>1599941686007< /date>< Resp>

<text>Great customer service under new ownership . I’ve come to this place for a few years and now under new ownership it’s so much better! Very clean! Tim is so detailed and he’s truly an artist! Nancy, omg! She will put you to sleep on your pedicure when massaging time comes! Everyone is friendly and great customer service, but Tim and Nancy are my favorite!  I strongly recommend them!</text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

I went to a number of places until I found Julia at Jade Nails. I was looking for the service i was used to in NY and found it here. Clean and sanitized tools.  Numerous colors to choose from, each offered as gel or regular polish so you can have gel nails and a matching regular pedicure. Friendly technicians. I walk out happy every week.< /review>

<text>All I gotta say is, CHOOSE YOUR NAIL SALON WISELY.
I was coming here quite often until I started being hassled to pay for more than what I wanted. The work done here is good, but could be better if stylist cared more. I wanted a certain color on my nails and was handed one color manual & when I asked if there were more colors in my color category, I was told no. To my surprise, as I was leaving, I saw another color manual with a color I would have been over the moon with & when I inquired about it, the stylist shrugged & acted as if it wasn’t her concern any longer.
Pricing is inconsistent. DO NOT GO OFF PRICING ON FLYER, IN STORE PRICING IS MORE & they do not honor flyer prices regardless of their advertised price.
There’s other places around that I’m going to try. Unfortunately, this salon was closest to my home but I want my moneys worth.< /text>< pics>

UPDATE: My girl, Mai, left Jade and went to Lucy's and I followed her. I am SO glad I did. The same service is about $10 less and the overall feel is nicer at Lucy's.
TWO YEARS AGO (original review): So sweet and accommodating. Very relaxing. I won't go anywhere else.< /Text>

HORRIBLE PLACE! PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY! I have visited this place a few times that was my mistake. I always gave them the benefit of the doubt that perhaps they may be having a bad day. Nope! They’re just horrible the owner has a horrible attitude and doesn’t even greet you or thank you for your business. Also the Gel nail polish tends to chip a few days after getting it done!<//Review>

This place is expensive and they are rude. Went here myself when I moved to the area and it was so much and they didn’t do a very good job. Then I gave them a rating of 3 stars and wrote a review which their owner sent me messages on accusing me of being another nail salon. After 4 years went back because it was supposedly under new management. Took my 5 year old to paint her nails. Everywhere else it’s 10 to paint nails and toes. Here they charges 15 for her nails only. Never going back.  This place is a joke.</text>

I think they recently changed management, and they've really spruced the place up! It's so clean and fresh, I felt like I was treated like a princess! All the equipment is clean. They did a beautiful job on my pedicure, with a very intricate design. Definitely going back!< /Text>

For a one-stop, this place is okay. But as a regular I would not recommend coming here. I was a regular for over a year, at some point over the last few months this place has gone down hill. Good employees started to leave & every time I would come in a new person was doing my nails. They became so damaged, that most of my nails started to break very high up on my nail even with the slightest bump. They filed them down so much that they became grooved on the tops of my nails; they also took them in on the sides so much that it created a weak point for them to break.
They are just nails & they will grow back but given I was a regular for so long & tipped well, I expected my nails to have been taken care of.
There are several other nail salons near canyon lake that will take good care of your nails. (Letting Go Salon)</Review>

<text>lady by window who looks like owner did my nils terribly got them done for prom and she only put matte top coat on three nails and argued with me that she put them on all of my nails. ended up being too thick i should not have gotten matte as soon as i noticed that the matte top coat was wet and wild which is about 2 dollars at walmart if i got to a salon i would want the polish used o my nails to be good quality i could by this myself. in the end i has to repaint  and FILE my nails at home because they were messy and ended up looking better than how she did them and shes a professional. i would never come here again</text><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc9c74b74a6ff5:0x9c1692422373b420<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

HONEST REVIEW
I have paid for the following services:
- LASHES (1)
- ACRYLIC NAILS(3)
- LIP & BROW WAXING (2)

NAILS: Poor/Cheap products are used making the nails-  last about a week, 2 if you’re lucky.
Most are really slow and yet still don’t find the time to paint the complete nail. (3/10)

LASHES: DO NOT GET YOUR LASHES DONE HERE.
The products they use ARE NOT the same as an actual Lash Exstention Technision, They purchase the Argell lash kit from Sally’s that’s $11 and use horrible glue that burns + irritates the eyes and it dries really fast. THE LASHES ARE PLASTIC so you can feel them at all times, when u close ur eyes it hurts very much. And when u open ur eyes after she’s done applying 9 times out of 10 she will glue your eyes shut due to being messy and not seeing glue get on ur bottom lashes. When I went to open my eyes I couldn’t, she wanted to cut my actual lash to help the situation LOL.

I was told they would last a week when usually authentic Lash exatentions last atleast a month... They all fell out by the end of the day and I didn’t wash,wet or touch them.
$100 - My natural lashes were clumped up with flakey hard, glass - like glue.

This is NOT an authentic eye lash extensions  service. (0/10)

BROWS/LIP WAX: RUSHED, Very Messy, Very Rough. Wax on my lip, lashes and even on my Brow and hair. After waxing I looked in the mirror and it looked as if I didn’t even get waxed, Hair was still obviously there VERY noticeable so I turned to speak up and she was gone. Same for lip. (2/10)

The prices are the same at places that give you QUALITY SERVICE.
This place is very cheap yet still kinda pricey.

I will NEVER come here again.< /Text>

My wife tried this place on two different occasions. They are inconsistent with pricing. They rush you out if you are NOT a REPEAT CLIENT. She went back to ask for a touch up and the lady started screaming at her. Overpriced and terrible customer service!< /Text>

<Review>I admire this spot! They prepare marvelous meals, their menu is large, The chief cook in that place is very trained, I love very much eating all their food. The food is consistently fresh and tasty, the attitude towards the customers  is good. I often go to  this place and I was never disappointed.

More sauce and less rice cake, more vegetables, maybe served over rice for a change of texture and it would have been perfect.< /text>< pics>

(Translated by Google) It is so bad that I ate it. I went to visit it again and I ate bibim noodle. It is much tastier than the famous noodle house.

<Text>As the mother of a gamer/artist, I concider this a nice, clean location.  Attentive and welcoming staff.  Didn't have what ever my son was looking for yet he still spent some decent time inside.  They do enforce limited capacity which is very comforting to us mothers. 📒✍ you can probably allow your teen to take his time inside while you go ahead and start your Costco shopping which is walking distance from here. (Well for the kid to find his way over)<//Text></record>

To be honest!! There’s only one good associate at this spot. But the Manager here is rude with no experience with customer service and gaming.</review>

< Review>
Today we called the GameStop if we could trade in my Xbox for a PlayStation 4. They say yes and we tell them we’re coming. Takes us half an hour to skate there and when we get there the morons told us we needed an adult ID when they could’ve told us that on the phone. 👏👏 you guys definitely know how to do your jobs.<//Review>

They care more about their sales ticket rather than having a happy customer leave the store. Been coming to this one for 8 years & gonna stop coming.<//text>< pics>

<text>Decent customer service. Called before to get a game and driven miles to get it only to know they had ship it out. Hard to believe since they had the case there too. The dude didn’t want to look for it either, wasn’t gonna rush them either. Don’t plan on coming back to this game stop. Waste of time.</text>< userid>

I had my girl go pick up my preorder and they didn't even give her a receipt. Then tried to give her my DLC code over the phone and it was wrong. All because of the manager! But it's ok when I finally went it one of the female workers gave it to me no problem. It's just that dumb manager.<//Review>< pictures>

My son loves video games just like me when I was little! Atari, 2400, 6400, Sega DreamCast, PS1, PS2 amd PS3.  I had all of them.  I turned out just fine!  Let your kids play video games.  Educate them on the dangers of talking to strangers and make sure you spend quality time with them.  Video games are a much safer option than running the streets! Bet?< /text>

Good cheeses, meat selection looked tasty too. Dude working there was for sure a bit stand off-ish, and I felt pretty judged when I was asking for prices.

But at the end of the day, the cheese is tasty and they know their stuff.< /Text>

<Text>Great selection of meats, cheeses, spreads, olives and vinegars. They are still doing sandwiches inside, but the menu that’s available is different from what’s posted online. Would still highly recommend< /Text>< username>

So incredibly rude. My father passed away last night and I called to get a cheese platter for the family. On the catering page of their website it says, "Exceptions are possible in emergencies and we are eager to accommodate any special requests whenever possible." I told her my situation and request, the woman checked with her boss, and they took all of my info. Then the employee calls back telling me "boss says no" with the boss audibly feeding her lines in the background. They weren't compassionate or even polite delivering this information, lecturing me on how I should give them more notice. Please.< /Text>

Say Cheese has great products, but it seems that the staff are having issues. I went in to get a sandwich on Sunday, 7/19 at just around 2pm. As as I walked in, a worker passed by me on the way to take his break I'd later learn. One of the staff, older than the other guys and with long hair, was upset that that worker went on break allegedly without saying anything. He yelled at the other two workers loudly complaining that he was saddled with all of the responsibilities and that no one helped him clean. He also reprimanded them harshly for changing the radio station, "Nobody has time to help me, but everyone has time to play DJ!"

It's understandable to get upset when you perceive that your coworkers are not pulling their weight, but to yell and swear loudly (F bombs and the like) while there are customers present is frankly unacceptable. I'll continue to shop here, and I give the food 4 stars, but that last visit made me really uncomfortable.</text>

They have a delicious line up of made to order fresh sandwichs including vegetarian options.  You choose your own bread such as Sourdough, Ciabatta, wheat and many more. You can also bring your sandwich or a bottle of wine from Say Cheese to the Cafe next door, zero corkage fee because they own both. My favourite is the Italian Combo and House Roasted Beef sandwich.< /text>

I hope Roger reads this since I love his cheese shop but his employees today were the absolute worst! Rude, off putting and cynical. So absolutely rude. I called to get sandwiches made to pick up and they said they could not, they were busy. I showed up not 5 minutes later to a completely empty shop, the employees complaining about people in the city being rude, which was totally ironic, and doing nothing else. When I arrived I said sometimes people in service are also rude and they immediately said they refuse to serve me. No one in the store  and sending customers away. The really</review>

Best sandwich for miles. Get there before 4 or 5 though—they run out of bread. Don’t sleep on the wine/cheese/snack options, either. Super nice guys who will gladly help you get what’s right for you.<//Text>

<review>Awesome cheese selection--really couldn't ask for a bigger one! The guy behind the counter is always super nice and allows you to try cheeses before you buy them. They also have amazing sandwiches that can be custom made and are very large--I was definitely able to split between two meals.</review><rate>4<//rate>< Name>

Amazing local shop.  Great selection, great service, staff very knowledgeable and helpful.  It's a pleasure to shop there.  Cheese of course, but great sausage, salami, and other cured meats, plus great wine and bread.  Oh, and butter.  What's not to love?</Review>

I love buying my fresh eggs from Say Cheese. I was pleased to see that they sell local pasteurized eggs. They are closer than walking to whole foods but they charge a hefty price for a dozen eggs. Still a good place to go when desperate for eggs.</text>

(Translated by Google) Great cheese shop and grocery store! There is a good selection of cheese and the manager is a connoisseur. There are several choices of raclette cheeses! Wonderful and delicious.
They also have some sausages and dry sausages (mostly salamis). I recommend the country pâté, it is well peppered, it is a killing. Good choice of wines too, and some Spanish (crisps, preserves, alfajores, quince jelly) and Italian products (pasta, balsamic vinegar from Modena). ❤️🧀

(Original)
Super fromagerie et épicerie! Il y a un bon choix de fromage et le gérant est un fin connaisseur. Il y a plusieurs choix de fromages de raclettes! Merveilleux et délicieux.
Ils ont aussi quelques saucissons et saucisses sèches (surtout des salamis). Je vous conseille le pâté de campagne, il est bien poivré, c’est une tuerie. Bon choix de vins aussi, et quelques produits espagnols (chips, conserves, alfajores, pâte de coing) et italiens (pâtes, vinaigre balsamique de Modène). ❤️🧀</Review>

<text>Did a photo session here and had a lot of fun. We didn't walk too far down the trail, but there was moderate public use of it by bicyclists and walkers alike. The play structure was a lot of fun for the kids, and there is a beautifully manicured grass area next to it. There was a very potent sewage smell, however, which is why it's only 4 stars instead of 5. We left earlier than planned because it was so bad.<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>Nice little neighborhood park with a creek running through it. There are big grassy areas with gravel and asphalt paths cut through them. Two picnic tables and two benches. There is also a small playground with a rubbery flooring for kids. No bathrooms, so keep that in mind. Great park for playing Pokemon Go because there are two gyms and four pokestops.</Review>< GmapID>

My daughter and I thought the birria was delicious! Very authentic.

I must have literally driven past this restaurant without noticing it hundreds of times over the years. It is very easy to miss; small, no flashy sign, and just blends into the little strip of business where it is located. It is not a fancy, but we were treated very well by the family who owns and operates this business. The service and food were both great, and I will definitely be going back again!<//Review>

Mexican spot tucked at the end of a small strip mall sharing the parking lot with a sports bar and liquor store. I was the only one who wasn't speaking Spanish while I was there.

As their name implies, birria is their specialty with Birria de Res (beef) and Birria de Chivo (goat) available in both seca (dry) and caldo (soup) forms. Menudo and pozole also are listed under Specialties  and other Mexican standards are on the menu like burritos, tacos, enchiladas, and tortas.

The Caldo version comes with corn tortillas, lemon and lime wedges, and topped with onions, cilantro and salsa. The broth is flavorful and mildly spicy. The goat meat was tender and not too gamey.

I liked it, but thought it was a little pricey at just under $13.

Friendly service.<//text>

The Birria tacos are simply delicious. The goat was was tender and juicy. The broth was absolutely heavenly. It was a bit pricey at just under $4 a taco, but i was hooked after the first bite in 48 hours I've ordered tacos 4 times. Even the kids love the goat meat. I am completely addicted to these tacos.< /text>

I love my tacos. For me is always my tortilla and steak, nothing more, no onions, cilantro or anything else,  why? Because when you gave me such a juicy flavorful steak perfectly seasoned,  you don't need to add anything for a better flavor 😀. I love this place and i highly recommend it.  I feel at home when I'm here,  everybody is nice, polite and happy to help.< /review>

<text>I never leave bad reviews but this was one of the worst birria that I've ever tasted the broth ( consome ) was super salty the rice tasted like old oily rice and beans tasted straight out of a can. Never again! Took forever to bring out! Not worth a penny!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

(Translated by Google) The food has good jalisco style seasoning, only that as many times as I have attended, I feel that they have more attention for the fourth clientele.

(Translated by Google) Sunday, May 22, I got to eat birria, the slow service, the orders of birria with little flavor, the refried beans and rice came swimming in water, ask the waitresses for something to bring what we did not want to eat there, they never gave it to us at the table, I had to go with the cashier to ask him,
It is assumed that it is unhygienic for cashiers to wait for the fact of using coins and bills, never put on gloves,
Hopefully the owner will pay attention to my comment and not delete it.
Thanks and good day

(Original)
Domingo 22 de Mayo, llegue a comer birria, el servicio lento, las ordenes de birria con poco sabor, los frijoles y arroz refritos venian nadando en agua, solicite a las meseras algo para llevar lo que no quisimos comer ahi, nunca nos lo dieron en la mesa, tuve que ir con la cajera para pedirle,
Se supone que es antihigienico que las cajeras sean meseras por el hecho de utilizar monedas y billetes, nunca se puso guantes,
Ojala que el dueño ponga atencion a mi comentario y no lo borre.
Gracias y buen dia</Review>

<Text>07/28/2020 Eric and Josh checked my bathroom yesterday (07/27/2020) and they said that, it is not really easy something, so they needed to come back today. I could not shut-off the water for about 30 hours. Today Eric showed up on time and he fixed the issue really quick. Eric and also Josh are really professional, friendly, fast and honest. The first company gave me estimate $2300-$2800 but Eric fixed the issue just for $200. Thank you so much Pic Plumbing Services. I really appreciate it.
Highly recommended. As you see from the pictures, now i have a nice shower again. I would give more than 5 stars for this guys! Thanks for not charging me more than it needed! I am so happy from this experience! Thanks a lot Eric!</Text>< Gmap_id>

Service was excellent. Erick listened to my concerns and took care of it.   Took his time explaining the causes for the issue and hopefully resolved. From the beginning of my call to the end, I’m extremely satisfied with the service received.< /Text>

<Text>If you are looking for prompt, professional service with excellent pricing, call PIC Plumbing Services! We had a clogged drain issue in our home that was built in the 60's. We did suspect it could be something more since there was water actually leaking at the bottom of the pipe from the overflow in the laundry area. When Josh from PIC arrive (on time) he promptly and professionally introduced himself.  He then proceeded to spend some time trying to snake the drain before  it became clear this was something more. Josh identified the problem which turned out to be the P-trap. After clearing the line and replacing the P-trap and everything else that was 60 years old that needed to be replaced, problem solved, end of leak!  For the time spent on the job, we expected a pretty large bill. However, that was definitely not the case! It was a pleasant surprise and you can bet that in future we will use PIC again. Their prompt, professional service and great prices makes for a trustworthy company. Thank you again PIC!!!!<//Text><name>Shelly Dowers< /name><date>1611977505916</date></record>

During the time that he was to arrive at my house to give me an estimate, I get a call from him. Before he made the effort to come by, he wanted me to explain what I wanted done. I had already explained what I needed done when I messaged you on Yelp so I was confused. He said that way  he could give me a rough estimate over the phone.  If I didn’t like the estimate on the phone, he didn’t have to waste his time coming out. He was rude and condescending. I told him I would look elsewhere.< /Text>

I am beyond impressed with the responsiveness, professionalism, and genuine kindness of PIC Plumbing. I reached out to PIC plumbing and  was greeted by Blanca. When I expressed that I preferred to speak with a technician about my specific issue, she took my information and a plumber called me back within 3 minutes.
The technician on the phone (I have forgotten his name but I believe he is the part-owner?) was very personable, knowledgeable, and so willing to help. He scheduled me for next-day service (I was making this initial call at 5pm on a Monday and I had an appointment for 12pm the following day!)
The company uses a great text message feature/system that alerted me of my scheduled appointment as well as when the plumber was on the way to my house.
The plumber, Josh, was 2 hours ahead of schedule and called me personally to see if the time was convenient to come early or if I'd like to keep my scheduled appointment time.
I agreed for him to come early and my job was done within an hour.
There are no hidden fees or gimmicks with this company. Having dealt with 4 other plumbing companies in SD, this team is honest, reputable, professional, and genuinely good people - turning the stereotype around for the bad reputation that plumbers can typically get.
PIC Plumbing is my go-to company for all my plumbing needs for as long as i am in San Diego!
Thanks, team!<//text>

Josh and 2 other guys did a great job they came back several times to make sure my sump pump was working properly.  Most company’s don’t work on these pumps however PIC does and I appreciate what they have done.  Call PIC for all plumbing needs their the best.</review>

Super happy with PIC. I had a slab leak that looked like it would require a straightforward reroute, but it ended up being much more complicated because of some prior plumbing work that had been done by the previous owners. It ended up taking much longer than they'd anticipated. Not only did they not charge me for the extra work, they actually lowered the price a little because of the inconvenience it caused me and my family (because they had to come back a second day). On top of that, they had the best response time of all the plumbers I contacted -- they were out at my place within a few hours of calling them. Josh and Eric were both prompt, thorough, transparent, and friendly.< /text>

Very responsive and excellent communication skills. They didn't even charge me for a house visit when they realized my tenant didn't run the garbage disposal and that was causing the issue. Anyone else would have charged. I will definitely use them again.< /Text>

I was very pleased with the service I received from this company. They were able to fix what another plumber could not. Josh, Joshua and Eric came in assessed the problem and went right to work. They were all very knowledgeable and was able to fix the problem in less than an hour. I am very satisfied with the service I received and I highly recommend PIC plumbing.< /review>

My drain is still clogged BUT the technician didn’t try to up sell me on anything and they even said I should explore my options. Seemed trustworthy in telling me what I can do. Seemed experienced by describing similar jobs and pricing around them. I will definitely have them at the top of my list to use them again if I have plumbing issues or if I need something new installed.< /Review>

Awesome job by Joshua and the PIC team. From start to finish, extremely well done. My break down for my service.

Referral: I was looking at replacing 2 shower faucets due to incorrect installation when I purchased the house a few  years ago, I was looking to upgrade my faucets as well. I saw the reviews from Yelp and decide to get a quote. I send quote messages to 5 companies including PIC and I received a response within 10mins of my message from PIC. I researched a few other companies and they were the best of the others very reasonable and helpful for the price and service I wanted. I received a call and text that Joshua will be my plumber.

Work: I received my quote invoice and schedule texts 48 hrs prior to schedule day. On the day of schedule appointment, I received a message that Joshua is coming at the schedule time. He arrived early and was ready to assess the situation.  He followed all the COVID-19 protocols, wore a mask, gloves, maintain social distance. He said that the work can be done, during the check he notice my toilet needs to replace the flushing faucet and he said he can do it too, no extra charge.  He need to order the faucets as my shower faucets were older versions so the work was delayed for about 10 days to get the new faucets. I received a message from PIC that parts received and ready to schedule the work for replacement. Joshua can over and replace all the faucets and replace the flushing faucet in my toilet. He tested all the faucets but noticed that it was still off, so he rechecked and found the gaskets were off so he added the gaskets and my shower faucets are good to go. I was offered a military discount and saved some money and received a Great service.

Overall great experience even though the COVID environment it was very professional. Highly recommended!!!< /text>

I absolutely love these guys. After dealing with a terrible plumber who constantly had excuses and would not show up, or be days late, it was amazing to deal with PIC. Their customer service is amazing and the plumber actually shows up in the designated window of time. I will definitely be using these guys for all of my future plumbing issues. I'm very impressed!</text>

Joshua did a great job. He arrived on time, was professional and knowledgeable, and walked us through the options and repairs. We will continue using PIC in the future.< /Text>

My Drywall is getting repaired this week and it was recommended my copy pipes are looked at before installing new Drywall.  Eric came in and assessed my pipes.  Notified me that he did not want to waste my money and they are fine.  the decolorization is normal and it would be a waste of money to replace anything as they look totally normal.</Text>

< Review>
The sewage line in my house developed a Leaked and PIC had to repipe the whole house.  At first it was an absolute nightmare, A plumber from another company was going to only partially repair the problem and others bid the job way too high.  PIC took time to fully explain the problem and why they had to fix it and the steps he would have to go through to finish the job.  The were very PROFESSIONAL!  There was no selling, just solutions.  They immediately started and did what they said they were going to do.

I will definitely refer these guys to my family and friends.  They were affordable and efficient.  It's exactly what you would expect and want out of a plumber.<//Review>

Josh was a lifesaver! I called multiple plumbing companies until I finally found PIC. No one was able or willing to help us. We had to turn our water off due to a pipe leak (caused by my husband). I called Josh on a Saturday night and he was at our house first thing Sunday morning. He was super pleasant and efficient. PIC will be my go-to plumbing company from now on. Thank you for being awesome!!!< /text>

PIC is pretty awesome. I contacted 4 other services and PIC was the first to respond. Came over for an estimate but during the process figured out the issue and was able to resolve quickly and with a very reasonable price and quality work. Super impressed with Joey and will have them back if we run into any other plumbing issues down the road.< /text>

Josh at PIC plumbing was sent to me from Sears Home Warranty. Sears is the worst service ever, but Josh was beyond professional and courteous and was wonderful about the entire process. He quickly detected the problem and gave me all the details of what he needed to do. He did a quick fix before Sears authorized the job to stop the leak from damaging my walls and floor even further. He always answered my call and came exactly when he said he would. Cassandra at the main office was also very pleasant and kind. I will definitely use PIC plumbing in the future and I highly recommend them! Thank you Josh for your work and patience!</review>

They responded immediately to my Yelp request and setting an appointment was quick and easy. Repairman was early to arrive, very professional and friendly, and did the work quickly and accurately. Couldn’t be happier with the service or the company.</Text>

Josh took care of this leaky faucet issue quickly and responded with working with my schedule.  The cost was less than another vendor that contacted me and the receptionist and Josh were very polite to me.  Covid safety guidelines followed and repairs explained and part replaced shown.< /Review>

Complete rip off unprofessional Called for moderate leak in our water heater morning of New Year’s Eve Wanted to charge us $2350 for a “Home Depot water heater and install  as they couldn’t get others due holiday
Got bids for 1600 and 1700 for the exact same work with two other reputable San Diego companies

would NEVER EVER RECOMMEND them</text>

We had a sink clog up on a Friday night - PIC plumbing answered the phone and booked us for the next morning. They called twice in the morning to let us know their time of arrival. They worked efficiently and were proffesional. Overall it was a good experience and I would definitely call them again.<//Text>

I've been there several times and I really like it. There is enough variety to please everyone, the conchas are huge, and my kids love all the sweet bread and cookies.</text>

< Review>
I've been looking around town for a panadería to be my go to. I found it. The bread is absolutely delicious. I've had the pleasure of grabbing some conchas as they came out the oven. It's always clean and I've never had a complaint about customer service. Evey bread Everytime has been a wonderful treat. Of course it doesn't hurt the kiddos love it as much as I do.</Review>

<Text>I came here for my birthday hoping that they had a small Tres leches cake since my local Cardenas sadly did not have any due to Mother’s Day Weekend but thankfully they not only had one but three tres leches cake that I could choose from so that made me so happy and yes, it was delicious! By the way the lady who attended us was so nice so we’ll definitely be coming back soon to get cake & try their bread!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Right down the street from my grandparents house I grew up on this.  I live in Texas now and dream about this panaderia.
Food is always, fresh price good & service is great.< /review>

They weren't very helpful when I asked if their sprinkled cookies contained milk or butter. All they said was "I don't know" in a dry monotone. If you work at a bakery you'd know the ingredients within the product. Maybe they were helpful to other people but they elicit prejudice if you aren't a fluent speaker of Spanish which is bad for business and is downright rude to their customer base. Non-spanish speaking hispanics, steer clear from this unethical family business.< /text>

<text>I really enjoy their bolillos rellenos. Ham, cheese and jalapeno stuffed into a fresh bread (bolillo) for 1.35. You have to be there before 8 AM typically. Also they have cream cheese stuffed mini bolillos. With or without jalapenos. Also really good. My fav. spot for bolillos rellenos. Only these ones I tried in my youth by a church member beat them out . I do not like the other ones offered in town. Maybe because you have to get these fresh or you miss out! They only cook them in the morning.< /text>< pictures>

One of my preferred spots for quality Middle Eastern food. Entered near ten, it was not crowded. Service is consistently good. It has a great feel to it. Feels similar to a cafe in Chicago I liked.</Review>

Good quick bite or sit down. The chicken kabob are fantastic. The new owner is so nice and friendly.  The Hummus and the Taboulah are excellent and very authentic like I remember them from my childhood.  I will definitely keep on going back.<//Review>

<text>Both the service and the food was excellent. Very filling portions in a truly authentic atmosphere. Many ethic food eateries alter their style and environment to suit the typical uneducated American mentality by providing a less than genuine experience. Taste of Lebanon is true to the culture in all aspects.< /text>< username>

The new owner insists to be too friendly. He insists to shake your hand with his dirty one. He insists to let you listen to his stupid stories. The place is dirty. Flies were flying around, and the food quality is not much.. be aware...< /text>

This place is amazing! The food is good and the service is quick. It's the perfect place to get a Mediterranean plate for low prices. My favorite is the Gyro Speical which is only $4.99.< /review>

<Text>The chicken looks like beef. I think they gave me the wrong order and I am too far to take the food back. First of all the chicken swarmma bowl didn't come in an actual bowl, but a sterophome container. The presentation of the said bowl wasn't as appealing as I hope it would be.  Rice, meat and sauce is all I got. The restaurant itself needs an upgrade. And the bread they gave me taste dry.< /Text>< pics>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Just had lunch here. The owner was very nice and the service was fast. I got the vegetarian plate, which is a great deal - comes out at about $10 after tax and includes a drink. I'm a big fan of Lebanese food - I basically go around trying out different places' vegetarian plates - and while I can't say this place is the absolute best I've ever had in my whole life, it's very good. And that's especially so considering the price.

Tabbouleh was nice and lemony, hummus was creamy, falafel were crispy on the outside and soft inside - basically, everything in order! I particularly liked the tahini dipping sauce - more flavorful than what you get at other places, there's definitely something extra in there although I'm not sure what. The dolmeh was good - but I guess I'm a little spoiled because I'm used to vegetarian plates coming with more than one :)

I also got a spinach pie to go - again, a little spoiled as I'm used to that coming with the vegetarian plate. But now I see why - this place's pies are huge, basically a full meal (comes with tzatziki). It was cooked fresh for me just like the falafel. Nice and lemony filling. They made the pie with the same flatbread that was served with the plate, which I guess gives you a break from phyllo dough if that's what you're used to - and also lets you eat it as a handheld meal if that's what you're after.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

It was my daughter's first visit and everyone made us feel very welcome here. Dr Lauritzen took lots of time to explain the treatment plan and made me feel extremely at ease. Everyone from the receptionist to the gal who took my daughter's photos to the Dr made this the best possible experience you could have! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</text>

The staff and Dr. Lauritzen made me feel very comfortable. The Dr. spent a good amount of time explaining the process and information valid to my current dental situation with a caring and simplistic manner, so that I could understand the ortho jargon. I would definitely recommend Dr. Lauritzen to others.< /Text>

<Time>1505201075009<//Time><user_id>105631422923733418749</user_id><review>Lets get straight to the point. Dr lauritzen is a smile artist. He's a perfectionist and will not close your case or finish your treatment until he has done his absolute best ability to make your teeth as perfect as possible. He is creative and educated on every potential idea and technique he can implement to make the end result of your case ideal. He's amazing at making you feel welcome and taking care of you as a patient. Although, to be honest I feel like more of a friend than a patient when I'm in the office. Every single staff member greets you with smiles and is caring and exceptionally kind. And every member of this office truly operates as a team and does their absolute best to make sure you leave the office having felt comfortable throughout your whole experience there. They take notice in details in your conversations throughout your treatment and truly make you feel welcomed. I can go on and on. You will not find a better orthodontist than Dr. Clifton Lauritzen. Nor will you find better staff. Period. Stop looking. You're wasting your time.</review><name>Tyler Klinkhammer</name></record>

This is THE place to get the best orthodontics care in the valley. Once you experience this office you will not want to go any where else. "<//Review>< resp>

You all do a great job! The staff are very kind and helpful, and it feels very personal and professional. I was a bit daunted about getting braces, but I feel like I'm in good hands. Thank you very much.< /Text>

< review>
This was THE best office visit in the entire time I have been coming - MANY months, now! I was thrilled with the work done for me by Ceicali. She took such great care to keep me pain free. Opening the brackets is sometimes a chore - they do not want to let go. She performed that task in a way that did not give me more pain. She had to remove two brackets and reposition them as well as add another bracket where none had been. This often hurts, but not this time! She also put "chain" on both the top and bottom and for once I could actually get the floss-threader under the chain to clean my teeth. I didn't know it was possible to have a space to easily get the floss between teeth. She apologized to me because she said I would be hurting later, but the pain was minimal. I am so appreciative of you all.</review>

Dr. Lauritzen is by far the best Orthodontist in the county. His staff is always beyond warm, friendly and welcoming! It's obvious that everyone who works there loves their job and their patients. Everyone knows everyone on a first name basis. Dr. L makes sure his patients are MORE than taken care of. Not only will you leave his office with the perfect smile, but you'll also leave with lifelong friendships!< /text>

5/31/2016:  Sabrina was very happy with her visit and that she only has twelve more weeks with her Invisalign.  Your staff is always helpful and I  and my daughter appreciate the promptness of being seen a few minutes after our arrival. Thanks Dr. Lauritzen!< /text>

I was highly impressed with Dr. Lauritzen and his staff.  They were helpful in every way possible ... to filling out paper work, making me feel comfortable and explaining the process of braces.  Looking forward to my next appointment with my children!

Thank you Dr. Lauritzen!!</review>

Dr. Lauritzen's office is THE BEST OFFICE IN TOWN and possibly all around!!!! Friendly staff, clean environment, and overall a lovely place to be! My experience with braces was great! The office is extremely welcoming and there are plenty of seats in the waiting area for everyone. That is a plus! They know you by name and they acknowledge you. Ashley is a sweet lady. She asks me about my son, my life, and knows how to keep a conversation going. Bring her Ferrero Rocher, it's her favorite :) Melissa and I were pregnant at the same time which was neat. We had a lot to talk about. Her son and my son have the same name. I thought that was cool! Debbie Debbie, very sweet lady. I love her personality! Ceicali usually gets to hear me make excuses and complain about my teeth, LOL! Nonnie & I talk about life in general. Mary is wonderful and helped me with all the finances. Tina is the sweetest receptionist. I usually don't leave right away; we talk and catch up before I head out the door. Many places makes you want to run out the door and never return. Marisela has such a bubbly personality and she has such beautiful hair, haha. I have not worked with Mandy, however, I am sure she is as wonderful as everyone else. These ladies have become family. You DO NOT find many offices that communicates well with you. Last but not least, Dr. Lauritzen. HE IS THE COOLEST and he really knows his stuff! You can totally tell he loves his job! Super friendly, hilarious, and all around a great individual! Customer Service is where it's at and this team's got it!<//review>

I have been going here for a few years now and all i can say is I like it.  Wait time are non existent if any when you get their they'll see you right away.  They do everything right the first time so if you are in the market to get your kids or even yourself some braces look no further.<//Review>

If you are in the mood for food with bright crisp fresh clean flavor East West is the place. The spinach quesadilla is a great example of the delicious fusion of their cuisine and great fresh flavor. The Mediterranean platter is great  and the portion is big enough to split with someone. I've never had a soup here that wasn't tasty. The staff is friendly and very accommodating. Great that they have outdoor seating right now. I give East West an A+.</Review>

<name>Take Back Roads</name><gmap_id>0x8084462a8e6b4d47:0xeef316456fd839f7</gmap_id><review>Overall our dinner was very good! The veggies were fresh and tasty, and the hummus and baba ganouj were awesome. The falafel patties blew me away! We liked the beet delite, but both found the grape leaves to be just ok. I loved the tabbouleh, but my wife wasn’t a fan.

The vegetarian tacos were pretty good - the black bean chili had a great flavor, but the steamed veggies, and the brown rice on the side, were pretty bland. The side salad was good. The overlapping tacos was strange - the pitas were overlapping each other and filled together, so to eat them you had to pull them apart and spread the filling from one to the empty space in the other.

The outdoor seating area was nice, but there was a fair amount of road noise until rush hour died down - nothing they can do about that, though.</review></record>

They do have a gluten free menu and take lots of precautions to ensure cross-contamination does not happen from meal to meal. Highly recommend them.< /text>< user>

So many good flavors all under one roof!  We ordered 3 dishes to share amongst 3 people and we had leftovers!  The have beer and wine - even beer on tap and wine by the glass or bottle!  Come hungry and leave fully satisfied!  Everything is fresh made from scratch!!!  Don’t miss this place!<//text>

This place must be a local hot spot because it was empty at about 1130 then literally filled by 1200! And I can see why! The service was awesome, our waitress was super friendly and attentive despite having many other tables besides ours. The coffee is very good (especially their specialty coffees). We ordered soup and the Mediterranean platter, both were excellent! The hummus is truly to die for, so much so we brought back some just to eat at our hotel! If I lived here this would definitely be a regular place I go. Plus, bonus, parking lot in the back so no street parking needed! Would definitely come again the next time I’m in Santa Rosa.<//review>< Pics>

Excellent, delicious, nutritious real food and most importantly organic. Everything offered on their menu is scrumptious. Please do try their unique offerings, you will be pleased.

The service here is quick, kind, and pleasantly human.< /Text>

If You Are A Vegetarian or Vegan; You Will Love East West Cafe! (If You Are Not - You Will Love East West Cafe’!) This is one of my top 10 for favorite places to eat! The choices are not like regular restaurants; they are healthier,  ingredients come from local sources and are of the best and freshest quality available! The menu selection has something for everyone and it can be a tough decision! The food taste is beyond delicious! It’s scrumptious! The staff is attentive, but not annoying, they are accurate with good memories, and they have just the right amount of laid back attitude to maintain a very welcoming atmosphere where everyone feels comfortable with a sense of belonging! I’d give East West Cafe 10 stars if I could! IF YOU HAVE NEVER EATEN THERE; I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! EAST WEST CAFE. Healthy never tasted so good!<//Text>

Awesome, healthy, vegetarian food. I was so sad when they stopped serving their teriyaki salmon! It used to come with grilled veggies, a salad, brown rice, and sooooooooo much of that good teriyaki sauce! PLEASE add this to your menu again, my family loves it and I want other people to get to enjoy it too!
The rest of the food here is equally good (once my family finished mourning their favorite dish, they instantly found a new group of favorites...aka the whole menu). The vegetarian/vegan options are totally great! I haven't eaten meat in so long that I don't remember what a burger tastes like, but even over all that time I just haven't been able to make a meal of some of the overly-healthy vegan food that some places serve. I mean, I just don't feel full unless I have a protein, you know? So I was super happy when my family found this place, because they had super good falafels (which are really filling), a lot of their non-mean dishes incorporate beans and other protein-packed legumes, and overall their vegetarian dishes are super comforting while still being healthy and ethical! The omnivores in my family always talk loudly about how good the meat dishes are, so this place is perfect for everyone!
Oh, not to mention they serve KILLER breakfasts!< /text>

<Text>Amazing all around and super huge portions a bit on the pricey end, but compared to places like this in my city of Olympia, wa they offer a good variety of veganized options i wouldnt get and the portions are about 20% larger and just $2-3 more and the vibe is great. Certainly not no strip mall by a druggy filled bowling ally.<//Text>< pics>

Such a great, wholesome place. So many tasty house-made options. Some are gluten free, some could be vegan. They are all fresh and clean tasting. I love eating here after a hike in the park across the street. It’s kind of hippie like and all the ladies who work there are super cool and nice. They serve good beer and wine also.

I love the teriyaki chicken dish, the hummus plate, the tofu teriyaki and the salads. The dressings are also yummy.

There is parking in back and it’s right by the theater.
Good for families too!</Text>

You're in for a unique treat at this place! Two locales to entice and tantalize your senses. Huge entree plates for those with BIG appetites! Kid friendly. Best to go anytime after the breakfast and lunch rush. Wait service is awesome. Be prepared to take home at least half of your entree in a to-go box. Super yum, super delicious every time! I personally have had items on the take out menu and ate at both locales in Santa Rosa and Sebastopol. Consistent. Healthy.</review>

Always a pleasure! The veggie wrap was wonderful with the tomato side soup. I usually get one of their delightfully colorful house salads and signature basil dressing. Had to steal some of my Aunt's to get my fix this time. The lemon layer cake was phenomenal.

Service is friendly and prompt. Pricing is some of the best in the County when considering quality and quantity. I always think if this place first when making recommendations!<//Text>

The food was good. A bit expensive. The hummus is really flavorful. A handful of vegan options, a decent amount of vegetarian options, and lots of omnivore options. Decent (7/10) vegan chocolate cake. Crispy fries. Tasty falafel and pita. Great service. All servers and hosts were friendly. Our server, Aria, was very attentive even during what seemed like a busy dinner rush. There are two fireplaces set at about table height and interesting decorations and muted light in the dining area.< /Review>

I love this place. The food is delicious - great choices for vegetarian and vegan, but they also offer dishes with meat. My favorites are the falafel and sweet potato fries. The atmosphere is good and staff is very friendly.  Good sized portions. I like their lunch specials with soup or salad and a half order of the dish of the day. Great value.</review>

Fresh, filling, excellent flavors and made from scratch. Very accommodating of dietary restrictions. Menu is clearly marked with vegan, vegetarian and gluten free options. And they have vegan, sugar free and gluten free dessert options - yum! One of my favorite restaurants.</text>

Service was a bit slow. I had 40 minutes to grab dinner and spent 20 minutes of it for somebody to show up so I can order.
The food on the other hand was great - I had the Chicken Shish kabob and it was delicious; served wide a variety of grilled and fresh vegetables, brown rice, humus and Mediterranean bread.< /Review>

Sometimes, just because a place has been around a long time and you have enjoyed it many times, you forget to realize how amazing it is. On my last visit to this place, I was reminded. We had excellent service, wonderful food, a pleasant and inviting dining experience, and it's been happening there a long time! It's not a Mediterranean restaurant, or a Persian restaurant (as it is classified somewhere), it's more like a hippie, delicious, eat meat or not, restaurant that will satisfy everyone in the family.</review>

<Text>I love this place!  Great tasting healthy food, generous quantities, reasonable prices, pleasant/pretty ambience, happy and friendly staff.  This restaurant is a treasure. The owners treat us like family when we dine there too!  East West is not pretentious, which is another attribute I appreciate, as I live in Napa Valley where nearly every business puts on airs.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

I love East West Cafe!!! The food is so fresh and delicious. I can't get enough of the Hummus wrap. I was so thrilled that they also had a Gluten Free menu, which is essential for me. The staff was friendly, helpful and service was prompt. I also think that the interior of the restaurant is so lovely. You feel like you are dining in the home of a friend.<//text>

Met an old friend here that I haven't seen in approx. ten years. My salad was good quality and our waitress was nice, not overbearing like some can be. She was kind enough to realize that we were catching up on old times and didn't come to our table too often (an art that some people in service don't pick up.) She was still attentive and we enjoyed our meal. We sat outside and besides the restaurant being on a busy road, it was surprisingly peaceful. Would like to return again to have breakfast (my favorite meal of the day) and really dig in :) Will return.<//text>

<text>Amazing food. Vegan and vegetarian options available with not a lot of meat which I appreciate.
There is hummus in nearly everything you order but I don't mind that.
The food platters are very large so be prepared to take your food home.
Their wine is superb. Their dessert is awesome.
I wish I could go and taste everything on their menu.
Their waitstaff is so helpful and knows the menu like the back of their hands. They know how to properly recommend options to go along with your meal that complement what you're ordering.
The restroom is very clean and reminds me of a restroom that would be in someone's home.</text>< pics>

I was in town on vacation and a friend took me to East West Cafe.  I had no idea what to expect, but man was it delicious.  Everything our party ordered was good, but mine was outstanding.  I had the tostada which was such a fresh take on the traditional dish.  I am a huge fan and when I move back will be coming here regularly.< /review>

Happy for some. Husband loved that there were so many vegan offerings. They're attentive to food allergies in general. They could make a little more money with smaller portions, with better quality preparation and presentation. This is the third visit in as many years and each time, the meat has been overcooked and the veggies cut so chunkily that they don't steam through enough.< /Text>

We have eaten here on many occasions and been pleased,  however my husband and I had a very disappointing breakfast there this past weekend.  The waitress seem annoyed by our interruption of her side work. The eggs were not seasoned and everything else but the salsa was bland and unappetizing.  I will be back for lunch but think I'll skip breakfast in the future.</text>

<Rate>3< /Rate><review>I love the cozy cafe decor, relaxed socializing, that it's not a chain copy-paste restaurant and there is a health food vibe (brown rice, veggie plate, tahini,etc) where I can at least pretend that I am going to eat something healthy, but the food always leaves me a bit underwhelmed. Based on the atmosphere, I am always expecting something special and just get "okay".< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<text>East West Restaurant has unique and scrumptious food at a reasonable price. The ambiance is nice with both indoor and outdoor seating and the waitstaff is professional, conscientious, and friendly. It's located next to an alternative movie theater and across the street from one of the best parks in Sonoma County.

I really like this restaurant and would recommend it to anyone.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x8084462a8e6b4d47:0xeef316456fd839f7</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Food, meh. Service, not good.

Ordered the spinach quesadilla, which the menu says to allow an extra 10 minutes for.  Apparantly this message didnt get to the wait staff because our entree arrived about 3 minutes after the app.  (At least this explains the unwillingness of our waitress to change my wife's order 3 minutes after we put it in - we thought that with an extra 10 minutes it wouldnt be an issue... it was).

I ordered the chicken shwarma which was a gluey purple mess with about 5 pieces of chicken in it.  Not nearly enough of the thin, dry, burnt pita to eat it with.  Overall a poor presentation for a weak dish.

My wife had the veggie kebab (she tried to change out for a veggie burger which we didnt see on the front of the menu initially,  but this could not be accommodated. Even just a few minutes after ordering and well before our app).  It was ok.  It says there is pineapple in it, and the tiny piece we found between everything else makes it true (but hardly worth a mention in the menu).  1 kebab, a ton of flavorless,  mushy brown rice, and mediocre hummus and mushy  sides.  Overall, not great.

We had high hopes.  Disappointed.<//Review>

<Review>I enjoy going here on occasion. It's located across from Howarth Park which is adjacent to Spring Lake Park so it's nice to combine lunch and a walk in nature. I really wish they would update their menu a little and add some new options. Overall it's a nice environment and experience. .< /Review><UserId.>113522705398044080441</UserId.>< GmapID>

Not a great place for a.low carb diet, but the food I did get was good. I can't eat hummus, onions or soy, and am on a low carb diet, so it was a challenge. I finally ordered a "steamed vegetable plate" without rice and with chicken. The sauce was amazing, the vegetables cooked just right, and the chicken tender. It was just enough food to feel full without becoming overstuffed.<//review>

The hummus they have is fantastic, you just have to try it. My favorite dish is the chicken schwarma, the pita bread and hummus is a good combo; but add chicken, tomato, and grilled onion really sets the mood, just thinking about it makes me crave it so badly! Why do I love so far away! Why!!!!< /text>

Good place to eat for a mixed meat eater/vegan group. Servings are generous, food is meh. Noisy at lunch and dinner. Mid afternoon is quietist time. Sit in back in winter or expect to be blasted by cold air.< /Text>

McDougall Menu!! This is one of the few places within driving distance where I can have a delicious meal and know it's made without oil and added fat. I wish more places were this aware of the need for a no oil option.</Review>

Food very good.  Falafel wrap, tuna melt delicious.  Big wrap, easy/large enough to share.  Hummus was excellent too.
Good service, would return again for sure.<//Review>

<Text>Like others have said the food is great, but the service is horrible. the server didn't check back once, she didn't bring our drinks and a busser got the refills. We had to ask for extra napkins and get our own boxes.

This was after we waited 5 minutes for the server to get there.

I would give the food a 4/5 and the service a 1/5. I don't think I'd ever go back.< /Text></record>

<Rate>4</Rate><text>It was ok.  They serve gluten free, and we were taking a friend it to dinner that can't have gluten so our choices wetter limited.  Never asked me how well done I wanted my burger done to,  and out came out murdered.  Dry.  Sad.

This would be a bad review of it was just my meal,  bit the more hippy type flood was pretty good.  Waters was nice.

Don't think I will ever order a burger here again :(</text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x8084462a8e6b4d47:0xeef316456fd839f7<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

If you can get past the rude service, eat here. Honestly, I have tried to support their business because their food is actually great, but their servers and hostess have consistently been rude. They need some training, because I have discussed with several other co-workers who feel exactly like I do. The last time I went WAS my last time. It's definitely hurting their business and I feel sorry for the owner of this establishment.<//Text>

This place is hard to describe.  It's kind of a health food restaurant. You can get hummus and falafel.   It's open for dinner but I like it better for breakfast or lunch.  They do serve wine.  They also have a large tea menu.   There's outside seating that is fantastic 3/4 of the year and faces a large park.  This is a great place to go before or after spending time in Howarth Park/Spring Lake/Annadel. Also a great place to have dinner and a glass before you WALK to the movie theater next door.</Text>

<text>The food is good but choices are limited if you're gluten free. The only gf meats available are bacon and sliced turkey. It's no problem if you eat beans as the taco plate, falafel or hummus can be gf (but I can't eat beans). I had the BLT on gf bread and it was very good, but that's what I had last time... And the time before...<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<date>1447691804673<//date><rate>3<//rate><text>Eastwest is a usually hit, sometimes miss local eclectic eatery.
Pro's: fun selection of vegetarian friendly food, usually well prepared, but also a mix of meat-centric food, family/kid friendly (crayons and coloring sheet always available).
Con's: Actually eating there can be a little dull, kind of cold-sterile, not relaxing, sometimes blah staff (although, sometimes great staff!).
My favorite is the steamed veggie plate with grilled tofu. Runner up is the falafel wrap.<//text>< pictures>

The food is good. The atmosphere is ok. But the service is slow. We have had two instances where we sat for 5-10 mins and then someone came over surprised that we hadn't been helped.< /review>
