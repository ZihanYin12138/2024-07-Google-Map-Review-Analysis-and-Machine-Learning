The grilled chicken nachos were great, but at the bottom of the plate I found plastic that looks like it came off of a sour cream container.</text>

< Review>
This is a nice little place, we did not know it was there. The Staff were all very welcoming, the food was great and presented beautifully, the atmosphere was inviting. We will definitely be frequenting this little Gem. Next time we shall bring some friends to enjoy it with us. Chile Rellanos my favorite!!!!</Review>

I went in to order, was waiting for my turn, another couple walked in and cut right in front of me. The host didn’t even apologize or nothing. The food is decent, nothing special, and service was so so basically..</text>

My family ordered take out last night from here for the first time, and our dinner was so good! I had the steak burrito, and it was amazing. Good value for the burrito, it was a large portion. Guacamole is the best here! I tried the sour cream here, and it was amazing! Mexican food is my favorite cuisine, and we might order here again if we want to.</text>

<rate>1< /rate><review>Went there on a Sunday. There was one couple ahead of me and one that came after me. I went in and ordered, got a Mexican coke and sat down at a table. As I was sitting there the waiter got the first couple chips and salsa and place settings then they got their food. The couple that arrived after me got silverware napkins chips and salsa and eventually got their soup.
This whole time I have not received silverware napkins chips salsa or even my shrimp cocktail appetizer that usually comes before the main meal. I had my dog and I had all of my personal stuff on the table, obvious that I was staying to eat.
The waiter packed my stuff to go, which I didn't ask for. So I just asked for a refund. Then he started arguing with me. I said why are you arguing with me, just give me a refund. If I was not eating there I would not have sat I. A table that a customer was going to use, especially with covid.
First and last time eating there.
Oh, the coke was good.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

Ordered a family pack online and when I arrived I was told it would be a little while. I waited about 5 minutes and it seemed the worker was getting impatient and insisted that I take the bag of food that had been sitting there since before I arrived. When I asked him how fresh the food was he simply said "it's the same thing as what you ordered, take it and go". Well folks it was terrible, cold, and soggy and I shall not return. The cheese in the cheese enchilada wasn't even melted in the slightest. The tacos fell apart due to soggy shells. I like hot fresh food so I'm not happy.< /text>

Just had dinner with my family and we loved it. I haven't been to Cielito Lindo for quite some time (not sure why I haven't). Forgot how great the food and service is. We will definitely be back sooner the  later. Our new family favorite Mexican restaurant!!!</review>

The cowboy (ribeye) and the shrimp enchiladas are fabulous. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu. If they had a bar it would be perfect!!!!   Beer and wine are available.<//Text>

I had a fine lunch at Cielito Lindo. Even though nearly every table was occupied, the food came out quickly and was good.  They had a couple of choices to serve yourself at the salsa bar. The service was good as well.</Review>

<review>Awesome Mexican Food. My favorite is shrimp and rice plate. Very feeling and the sauce they put is one of a kind. Service is excellent!

<response>None<//response><text>The carnitas plates are the best. Actually all the food is excellent. Everyone we go there with has always enjoyed their selection. My favorite though is the carnita plate. Always have to get at least one crunchy carnitas taco too! A lot of food! And the service is great.< /text>< Name>

Food is delicious. My waiter set a basket of chips when we arrived but didn't mention there was a salsa bar in the back end of the dining area. Service wasn't the best, but the food was great.<//Text>

This place is pretty good.  I've been here before with friends.

I do feel bad for Doctorfeelucky's review though.  I just wanted to mention they don't tell salsa for you because their is a salsa bar where you serve yourself.
And they didn't come pick up your check because you pay at the register.

But i cannot defend the meal they made you. Because there's no way i could know that.

I usually get the tamales here.  Or if i feel like having a meal for later i get a burrito.  They are pretty large and incharge.<//Review>

I went on taco Tuesday and the food was delicious. The service was a little slow and the waiter got confused with the details of our order at one point. I suggest ordering your 2nd plate of tacos as you get the first, so you get them as you finish the first plate. I hear the service is only like this on taco Tuesday because there's so many people< /Text>

Good food here. If you come and sit down, you get chips and you can go pick out one of two types of salsa (mild or "mucho hot"). I've been here many times and ordered over the phone for pickup too. I've had the bean and cheese burrito, chimichanga, taco salad, and I've had their chorizo breakfast burrito too. I've enjoyed all the food I've had so far.< /Text>

<Text>My wife and I were on our honeymoon and were very hungry and craving good Mexican food. We came to this restaurant and the waiter have us a basket full of tortilla chips and a bowl of salsa, got our drinks, and then later got our order, my wife and I finished the chips and the salsa, which was very soupy by the way, and never got anymore. We normally always have chips and salsa to eat while wait for our food, but ok. We ordered fijite for two and, boy was it disappointing. It was not seasoned right. On the menu, it said it was somewhere around $22. But when we got our ticket, we charged $30 plus drinks and tax which totaled near $40. I consulted with our waiter and he, pretty gruffly, told me "you ordered fijete for two" and I told him "It said $22 on the menu and it says $30 on the ticket." Well, he corrected the error, but we waited for him to come back and get our ticket and let us pay it. We just left the ticket on the table with the exact amount of money due and left. Needless to say, he didn't get a tip from us.
So overall, no refill on the chips, we got overcharged, as well as the ones at the next table over, we waited too long to pay our bill, and the food wasn't good.< /Text>< gmapID>

Being new to the area, I looked in the local Yellow Pages (People still use those? Yes, some people do.) to find a Mexican food restaurant. The ad stated something about "Voted best salsa bar in Santa Maria!" Well that sounds encouraging, doesn't it? Who doesn't like a good salsa bar. How many salsas do they have, I wondered? With visions of perhaps as many as six varieties of exotic flavors dancing in my head, I walked in the door with my family.

It's a quite narrow restaurant, being in the corner of a strip mall, and laid out quite awkwardly. At the back I found their salsa bar, with a grand total of two salsa bowls: one large bowl for the mild salsa, one small bowl for the spicy salsa. In fact, both bowls were fairly small, and I guess technically it was indeed a salsa bar, but to me it barely qualified. If this is the best in the area, it is only because nobody else has one. Seriously, I'm much more impressed with El Pollo Loco's selection.

Ah well, brushing aside the disappointment we moved onto dinner. The first time, I ordered hard shell tacos. They were pretty good, and I had a good feeling about developing a liking for this place. The beans and rice on the side were ... well, they were beans and rice. They're never that great, but some places somehow serve better than others. These folks are not among the top with their beans and rice, but they will do. The rest of the family consumed their food, but the consensus was that it was serviceable food.

The next time I ordered a chile verde burrito. It was bland and disappointing. I ended up dumping salsa and Tapatio all over it to try to liven things up a bit, but it really didn't help much. To top it off, I ended up with a nasty upset stomach that night. I wouldn't say the food made me sick. Hey, it's Mexican food, sometimes that happens right? Still, I haven't been back. It seems the risk of upset stomach outweighs the tasty factor for this particular restaurant.

These days I find myself cooking my own food when I get the hankering for Mexican flavors rather than head over to this place for a ho-hum burrito. I may return soon to try their hard tacos again, but don't hold your breath.< /text>

I went in here with 2 friends- we had separate tickets.
As we were leaving I gave my money and bill to my friend to pay while I went in the restroom. In one or 2 minutes I came out and the manager jumped me as I was leaving and accused me of not paying.  Will never go back. Extremely rude. What did he think the 2 tickets my friend paid were for? Not that good anyway.</Text>

I've heard about Walker Burger for a little while, finally had a chance to stop in and try for myself. Very good burger, juicy and delicious! Love their big steak fries too! Great staff, very friendly! Plenty to choose from on the menu to satisfy nearly anyone. Really enjoyed the outdoor seating area, very scenic and relaxing.

When you're traveling Hwy 395 through Coleville make sure to take time out and stop by Walker Burger!< /review>

I remember when Walker Burger opened up in 1982.  You could place your order and have it delivered to Coleville High School just in time for lunch.  I haven't had Walker Burger in many years, as I moved away and don't get back there too often.  My husband and I went hiking outside Bridgeport, CA and decided to stop and get hamburgers,  french fries, Sierra Mist, and a chocolate chip milkshake.  🍔🍟🍦🥤
I do have to say, everything taste pretty much as I remembered.  If you have never been to Walker Burger, try to find some time and take a trip with the family to Walker, CA.
ENJOY❣< /review>

<review>Walker Burger is a very popular fast food restaurant on a stretch of highway with very few businesses. They have a very attractive outdoor dining area with a very attractive garden. My wife and I shared and Ortega Burger and order of onion rings and a butterscotch milkshake. All of our food was good. We will be back.</review><name>Jim Hardwick<//name>< Response>

Surprisingly good. Nothing fancy. Minimal service. Limited selections. Beautiful outdoor spaces to sit. Expensive with two burgers and beer battered onion rings being over $30. While they have beer battered onion rings, they do not have beer to drink. The burgers were hot and tasted good.<//review>

<Text>Awesome burgers great deep fried mushroom 👍. I didn't appreciate the guy who took the order! I over head him complaining that the construction workers didn't tip very well. Some of us haven't worked I. Two months and are behind on everything and have to stick to a budget to pay our bills and feed our family.</Text>< Pictures>

This restaurant is my favored. I visit plenty of restaurants but here I go the most. The stuff is very warm and the cuisine they offer is so good. I am always happy to have a decent dinner here. I recommend this place with pleasure.<//review>

<text>Walker burger has been a favorite of mine for years. Glad to see it's still running and hasn't changed. Exceptional food, great atmosphere the originators of outdoor dinning in my book, see for yourself. The food is consistently off the charts. Great burgers great shakes.<//text>< pics>

Was shown this place by the original owners of this place the food was great! Love the authenticity and how they keep everything as it is. However a young women named SALLY was really rude towards the family and I. I went back to grab our food and she kept giving me a dirty look to where I had to tell her something very very unnecessary would have been nice if she had some respect.... I get their was a rush but no need. But other than that worth the long drive!:)</review>

<username>Sean Farrell<//username><time>1565239306600<//time><rate>5< /rate><Text>Stopped here on my way home from a hike up Mount Tom. There is outdoor seating only, but it's a beautiful picnic style area. I got the Western and it was really good! And really big. I also got the fries and tried the onion rings. So far I like it all, can't wait to stop by again and try some of the other burgers. To top off the experience the you woman who took our order noticed our dog and offered us a free water bowl for her without us asking. Great vibes all around. If you happen to be in the area, you should stop here.<//Text>< pics>

This place doesn't disappoint!! The food is great and they have one of the best outside eating area's they call the "dining garden". By far the best outside eating area I've been to since we all now have to eat outside in our car in the closet or in the corner...<//Review>

I meet with friends this nice place quite often! This is the best place to grab a bite.  I go there routinely. The cooking is excellent, the staff members are professional and the charge is fair. I like being in this place for a rich meal.<//text>

<Text>Great place for a stop along 395. Food was good. Beautiful outdoor garden with shade and sun. Ideal for a break with kids and/or dogs. Took almost 40 minutes to get food which was long. They were busy though due to fire further up the road.< /Text>< user>

Eat in which is actually outside on picnic tables. Kids enjoyed the provided picnic blankets as they ate on the blankets. They make hamburgers, cheeseburgers,  a variety of burgers and fries and onion rings. I ordered the Keto Soy Power Burger that actually was delicious. There is even a dog walk and play area. Oh yeah, they make great milkshakes. It is like a little neighborhood where you can feel safe living there. They are always busy but get your food out in a timely manner. We always go once a year as a family after a day of fishing. Money wise, a little pricey but worth it for the ambience.</Text>

I hadn't planned to eat here, but I was running late for lunch in Carson City, and stopped here on an impulse - and so glad I did! This is a proper little burger shack, outdoor seating only. I had a bacon cheeseburger with crinkle cut fries, and I simply couldn't fault it.<//text>

<review>It almost always is 5 star and it tasted great! But I did have a stomach ache really bad afterward. This is very usually but im certain it was from something I ate there. It made me sad because I love it so much!</review><UserId.>104250217340272340296</UserId.>< pictures>

Stopped here on the way to Lake Tahoe from Yosemite. It was honestly one of the nicest spots on the drive. Clean bathrooms and a nice outdoor eating area<//text>

Been here now three times and every time the burgers are great. My wife’s first time and she says anytime we come through Walker that we have to stop and eat. She also said she loves the court yard. Nice and shady and away from the road. The buns are always fresh and the fries are always done well. I will always stop to have one of their burgers, like my wife said.< /text>

<Text>Great place to stop if you're in the area for fishing or camping, or just passing through. Burgers are delicious and our group's yearly tradition was fulfilled with some much needed ice cream cones! Clean restrooms and a huge seating area which is also dog friendly. All in all a great little spot.</Text>< pictures>

< Review>
Went here for the first time and I loved it. I ordered a Western Macho Burger and was not disappointed. About three or four people were in front of me in line and they made sure to ask if they wanted onions or not. The outdoor seatings are a plus with great outdoor scenes. Definitely recommend to stop by and check this place out if you pass it.< /Review>

Great little place on the 395 for a good burger or sandwich. A bit pricey but worth it. Awesome shaded outdoor dining area and they accept cc's.< /Text>

<review>A good recipe for a wonderful road-trip evening : a burger here and a night on the other side of the road at Toyabe Motel.
The burgers here are amazing (the Chile Ortega is gorgeous), the staff is great and the place is an incredible garden full of birds.
A must in Walker !</review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<review>I would give it a solid 5 stars except they implemented a new dumb policy.  For the past decade, we ALWAYS save our appetite for a Walker Burger when driving the 395. One on way down to So Cal and another on the way back to Lake Tahoe. In addition to the great tasting burger, their backyard is fun and relaxing.
My ONLY complaint is they now surcharge 3% on credit cards. I understand trying to cut costs, but to guilt customers into paying cash only limits how much customers are going to spend with cash. What is next? ,50¢ fee to use the bathroom? Parking fees? It's 18¢ on a burger. Just raise the price a quarter and let customers pay their preferred way without guilt. And take ALL major credit cards! My company pays my business meals when I use the American Express Corporate card. By saving 18 cents, you lost my splurge on milk shake and fries.  Not sure if they are trying to avoid paying taxes or just being short business minded.
But they do have great burgers and I heard they are selling so maybe the next owner will keep the recipes and menu but encourage credit cards because everyone spends more on plastic! Lol.<//review>< Pics>

Great, fast burger joint. I got the New Chicken Sandwich and man was it good! The setting is awesome, I love the little garden in the back and huge Smokey the Bear Sign. These folks are doing a simple thing right. If you want a great burger and fries at a fair price, definitely eat here. Perfect after crawling out of the mountains.<//review>

Love the burgers and one of the few places that you can get a rootbeer shake!!!!!  Try the large, its awesome.  Sadly, it's up for sale.  Wondering if it's all the California regulations that's killing it.<//Review>

While not top gourmet quality food, the overall meal experience is good. The strength of the place is that it is at the right place at the right time. We always look forward to a stop there.<//review>

<review>Stopped by here on accident looking for a different restaurant. I thought I would give it a shot. That was a mistake. My burger was greasy and was about the same quality as Jack in the box. I asked for no lettuce and it came with all the shredded lettuce. Would not recommend this place if you want a decent meal.<//review><Resp>None< /Resp><name>Lucas Dykstra< /name><pics>None<//pics><UserId.>117889898484205676025<//UserId.>< rating>

<Review>Great bacon cheeseburgers and fries.  Portions big so can be shared.  Wonderful customer service and worth the stop.  Remember they close for the season around mid October and don't re-open until sometime around mid April.<//Review>< Pics>

Food was good, flavors were good, but I dont know what all the fuss is about. They are a bit over priced and their fried food all tastes the same. I'm assuming due to dirty fryer oil.
$50 for me the lady and the kid. Could've stayed in town and spent the same amount without the hour drive.< /text>

New to the area, people told me
"You gotta try Walker Burger!"
After the first time I went I knew why.
Great place (outside patio/yard),
Awsome burgers and pleasant staff.
I go there, at least, twice a month.

<Text>If you haven;t eaten at Walker Burger, you're truly missing out!
This place has the cutest, coziest eating area and great milkshakes.
Since this is a very small town, you should bring cash versus a card. I forgot last time and felt super bad. Sorry guys!<//Text><user>112514252085016353743<//user></record>

Service was nice and quick, area is gorgeous, but the burger was uninspired.  Add some garlic and salt & pepper or something.</Review>

A,great place to stop and "hamburger -up"! And you can have a chocolate malt. As I pass  down 395,  I will stop again. Plus the owners are good people.  ECV</Review>

Great comfort food on a long road trip back from Yosemite (Taking the scenic route!)  Reasonably priced, great taste, and pleasant outdoor seating.  A welcome respite from the car.  As a bonus, the bathrooms were the cleanest we'd seen on our road trip!<//text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) We were in USA 4 weeks in October and have tested and eaten some burgers. When we were on our way to Yosemite we took a break in a small nondescript Names Walker. Walker Burger we had to take a closer look. What we experienced there was amazing! The lady was really extremely friendly not only superficially friendly but correct. So the first impression was ever positive. Then, after no long wait, there was finally the longed for burgers. I have never eaten so good burgers everything was perfectly matched. Likewise the fries. Since the big ones can hide behind. Dennys was the favorite for me, but I did not know the Burgers from Walker! So for anyone in transit: It's worth making a quick stop at the nice lady with your Walker Burgers! :-)

I almost forgot it: the outdoor area is very idyllic!

(Original)
Wir waren im Oktober 4 Wochen in USA und haben doch so einige Burger getestet und gegessen. Als wir dann auf dem Weg zum Yosemite waren haben wir eine Pause eingelegt in einem kleinen unscheinbaren Ort Names Walker. Walker Burger das mussten wir uns mal genauer anschauen. Was wir dort erlebt haben war der Wahnsinn! Die Dame dort war wirklich außerordentlich freundlich nicht nur oberflächlich freundlich sondern richtig.  Also der erste Eindruck war schon  mal positiv. Dann nach keiner langen warte zeit gab es endlich die ersehnten Burger. Ich  habe noch nie so wahnsinnig gute Burger gegessen alles war perfekt aufeinander abgestimmt. Ebenso die Pommes. Da können sich die großen hinter verstecken. Dennys war für mich der Favorit, da kannte ich aber die Burger aus Walker noch nicht! Also für jeden der auf der Durchreise ist: Es lohnt sich einen kurzen Stop bei der netten Dame mit Ihren Walker Burgern zu machen! :-)

Beinahe hätte ich es vergessen: die Außenanlage ist sehr idyllisch!<//Review>

<text>I was bored watching TV at my house, so I decided to go shopping in this mall. I was captivated by the place and the style in this entire mall. It was new, modern, and very clean. The saleslady and cashiers were very accommodating and pleasant. Besides, they have quality products that might be good to buy, for they last long. The first floor has also many stores, restaurants, and a gym that was very good to spend time and leisure. Overall, I love this shopping mall. Thanks!<//text>< GmapID>

Many different stores in this shopping center. I went to Luckys to shop. It's a very clean store with a huge fruit and fresh vegetable section.
Very good selection of items, sometimes a little over priced. Look for the sale items to get by in these hard times.
They do wipe the counter, credit cards machines and they clean the shopping baskets and carts.< /Text>

Decent location with a few gems located here. I've been frequenting this area for years and two locations have kept me coming back even after I moved into a different neighborhood. Those locations are Wasabi and Main Street Bagels. Both are good restaurants with a mom & pop feel and great service!< /review>

Great selection of food shops and restaurants. Workout place, coffee, nails, copy center, and more. The worst thing about this center is the parking lot... getting through the lot can give you migraine in itself...</review>

Had a lovely dining experience here. The food was delicious. Atmosphere was pleasant. Service was outstanding. The chef's food was so good.
Easy access. Good for Family Dining. They offer a variety of entrees, and
breakfast selections which are served all day long.

Pictured:
Delicious homemade tomato bisque soup, side salad with balsamic dressing, home fries, and a grilled veggie sandwich.<//Text>

Great as usual! Savory is having issues with the NCJ app. Apparently trying to get removed from it, is tougher than you would think. I do appreciate the app, but when a small business is losing money because of it, that's not so good.</text>

Came for the first time with a friend. It was an empty place at first with classy staff and a fancy menu. A few people came in for dinner a little later and the staff was pleasant and hospitable the whole time. Food was good. Had the duck. Delicious. A couple of specialty drinks and bottled beer.< /Text>

<text>This place is phenomenal! I love the food and the service is great. The gentleman who usually works the breakfast shift, Afsheen, it’s probably the best customer service employee I’ve interacted with since moving to Humboldt. Thanks for the service, I will definitely continue to Eat here regularly.</text><Gmap_id>0x54d1571243f1f1dd:0x10cad77a1a7377b2< /Gmap_id><response>None</response>< Pictures>

50 minute wait with no warning, no checking in, no apology, and a single drink refill. Just sat us down, took the order, and ignored my family and I for almost an hour. Rediculous. I never leave reviews but people should be warned, you will not be taken care of here.<//review>

If you like your stomach to feel greasy and nauseous go ahead . Every single thing had loads of that fake butter from squirt bottles . Browned  omelette on the inside so it was flipped after being over cooked on one side . Even the cheap English muffin was over greased . Just a block down the hill is good food done well .</text>

Love the landscaping greenery and all up to date amenities. All is your clean. Love the No smoking on premises 👏🏼🙌🏼..Office staff is courteous and prompt to fix anything. Area is pretty much quiet, not noisy, no parties. The only thing is I wish office would enforce more rules on renting to upstairs neighbors w big families and kids. The stomping and running and jumping makes the downstairs tenants suffer. Other than that, I love it💗</text>< user>

<Review>Really Nice Atmosphere. Family friendly. People just walking around in the afternoons walking their dogs. At night it's peaceful. We have 4 swimming Pools, some have a spa some a kiddie pool and even Barbecues. A recreation area with Pool Table, Ping Pong Table, Tennis Court, Golf putting area, Gated Playground, Dog Playground And Lounging Picnic Tables with big Barbecues and Couches for you and your guest with table heaters, really nice to have a small pizza party. A nice fitness center. A laundry mat. Plus we have over 100 stores, restraunts and even a big movie Theatre within a 3 mile radius.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

My boyfriend and I have lived here for 9 months now and we just renewed our lease! It's a comfy and well maintained. Haven't used the grill, gym or pools yet. I know we can't quite access certain areas due to covid but other than that, it's great.<//review>

Everything has been great, we enjoy the clean environment and it’s quiet. I wish the amenities were fully open so we can use, like the bbq and the gym. But otherwise no complaints.<//Review>

So here's the thing. I don't actually live here yet. My fiancée and I are looking to find a place to live, and our #1 pick is Avana. I made an appointment for my fiancée to tour the apartment and wasn't able to make it. a few weeks later, we were in the area, and although I didn't have an appointment, they let me run back to take a look at the apartment, and then answered all kinds of questions for me, and we had a few good laughs. Overall, the experience was amazing and although we wont be looking for a few more months, they helped us sign up for notifications and we are very hopeful that we will be able to live here. The staff is awesome and the facility is well taken care of. The apartments are exactly as pictured on the website, and as a potential tenant, you should be proud of your office staff and the first impressions they provide to people.

Hoping to see you guys in August!</review>

Avana is a wonderful quiet and green place to stay with family and Pets. A large territory is divided into different zones: recreation, water, sports, for children, for animals. Everywhere there is a well-groomed landscape with a modern design of small architectural forms. Avana complex offers to fill out an online application and then sign and fill out documents online. It's simple, convenient and easy. We are very happy to live here!</review>

< Review>
I been living here for a few years now, I do love my unit location because its very quiet and I love that it's close to shopping locations.
But.......there isn't enough parking spaces. If you work late be prepared to park far. Also carpet was very old and dirty since we moved in. Our AC has always leaked water and the maintenance guys dont know how to fix it because its been leaking water for years now. Also top balcony don't have a solid floor on the patio so if the people above you clean their patio then be prepared to clean your patio as well because all that will land on the patio beneath them. All appliances in the unit are old and out dated.<//Review>

This place is an absolute joke. If I were you I’d highly recommend looking elsewhere. We lived there for 2 years. Always paid our rent on time when we moved out we left the apartment in pretty good condition yet they had the nerve to keep more then half of our 1500 security deposit! To top it off they didn’t even let us know what the money they kept went towards. Whatever your security deposit is be prepared to not get most of it back. I have never been so disappointed in a management company. They are a money hungry company and I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone!!!!< /Text>

I have told the office several of times about cars parking into my ASSIGNED PARKING spot and nothing was done until someone broke into my car and stole my belongings. It wasn’t until then when they gave me a garage. Now, I have been having issues with my Ac since April. First, it wouldn’t past 80 degrees, they came fixed it. 2 days later it started to leak, they came fix it and left. It started leaking again, then they came fixed it and now today it makes a super loud noise when I turn it on. All I ever get from them is the run around. I am currently looking for other apartments but I aware you please stay away from these apartments<//Review>< Date>

Between Halle in leasing and the maintenance team this place is a true gem. Halle made the move flawless for us as well as kept us up-to-date on paperwork needed and Halle and her team were very welcoming. Had a couple of maintenance issues and they completed them in less then 8 hrs. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to call HOME.</review>

Decent apartment complex. Donna and most of the people in the front office are very friendly and helpful. They have a bunch of pools and spas which are very well kept, so that was a bonus. The only real complaint I have is that they charge too much for rent. $2029 a month as of Jan 1st, 2018 for a studio apartment on a 7 month lease, while there are much newer and nicer complexes in RC that charge around the same. But, if you need to find a place quickly like I did, then they will make it happen. They definitely are doing a great job when it comes to customer service and are easy to work with.

Edit - I thought I would give a complete picture since management replied to my review. I currently pay $1428 per month on a 6 month lease.

My renewal offer was as follows:
Studio Apartment
7 Months @ $2029 per month
10 Months @ $1982 per month
13 Months @  $1463 per month

I'd just like to be fair, there is quite a discount for a longer lease. I just personally don't like to be locked down to one location for more than 8 months or so, but you may be different. I also have updated my review from 4 stars to 5 stars because I realized how ridiculous it was to knock off a star because of the rent price.< /Text>

<Text>I have lived all over the I.E. and these apartments are by far the nicest. They are affordable and I am excited to see the new renovations.

Leasing Office:
Everyone is extremely friendly and helpful. Paul and Tony are the best!

Maintenance:
Orders completed in a timely manner. Sometimes the same day. I have never had a pest problem.

Grounds:
Kept nice and clean. Pet friendly. Potty bags and trash cans located throughout complex.

Parking:
A lot of people complain about this, however I have never had an issue with this. The rules are simple. If you live here park in your assigned car port or empty UNMARKED spaces. Make sure you register your car. Visitors (those you don't live here) park in spaces marked "VISITOR".< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

The staff at Avana are very sweet & super kind. We enjoyed our two year stay at Avana, but need to move closer to work. We had a few bumps, but that’s just apart of every day living. The community makes a difference in working together.
Again thanks

My wife and I have lived here for a year now and just decided to upgrade our apartment to a bigger unit.  The whole process was done in a timely manner, especially because of their electronic system and helpful staff. We were helped by Betty and Paul which made the process even better! Betty helped us out during our move-in day and was very proactive and charming during the whole process. Her knowledge and rapport with the rest of the staff made our transition seem less. She is our go to person!<//text>

<Review>I've been living in the Avana since Sept 2017 and my experience has been decent so far. The staff in the leasing office move pretty quick Betty, Celeste, and Paul are great anytime I need some things fixed maintenance comes in a decent time frame. I don't see any roaches here at all barely spiders since I been here. My only complaint is the dumpster area by my building needs to be washed down and cleaned. My experience here has been good.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Just moved into my apartment last weekend. The staff in the leasing office is great. They made my move-in very easy and stress free. Unfortunately, I'm having serious doubts in my apartment choice after my first week. First, there is hardly any available guest parking. The residents park their vehicles in the visitor parking, so there is nowhere for my girlfriend to park when she comes over to visit. Second, the loud sound of footsteps above me is unbearable at times. Since there is no carpet in the living room or hallway areas, there is no padding to help with the sound of loud footsteps of my upstairs neighbors, who has a small toddler that also like to play (bang) with their sliding closet doors. I can even hear the toddler running around at 2am and again at 5am. I feel like I made a big mistake moving here. I couldn't move to the top floor to prevent hearing footsteps because I am disabled and it is difficult for me to climb stairs. Looks like I'm stuck here for a year with sleepless nights and no parking for my guests.<//text>

Nice apartment complex! me and my friend stopped by the leasing office, looking for an apartments within our budget. Tony at the leasing office was very informative, professional and friendly! He answered our questions, showed us the unit we wanted to see and really took care of us. I really liked the apartment complex and liked the people working at the office and I'm strongly thinking of moving in soon.</review>

This would be a 5 star review because I very much think that these apartments are well taken care of and they offer great amenities. The reason it is only 4 stars is because the parking situation is terrible at night, they really need to create more parking somehow. I don't know if they own the empty lot next door but there needs to be more parking.<//text>

< review>
First, the roaches. And spraying my apartment any number of times wont help because they are literally coming up through the pipes. I have had to stopper the drains on my tub and sink to prevent seeing roaches in my tub in the morning. This issue will never go away until they address the breeding population in the sewers. I.e. Never. These issues will never be resolved because they will never go into the sewers.

Second, the service. I had someone out to my apartment every day for 5 days straight for my ac unit leaking onto my carpet. After 5 days, where each service request I reminded them how many times they had been to my apartment, they decided to schedule an ac repairman. Here's where things went south. I walk into my apartment and the glass bowl of my light fixture and light bulb is in my bathroom sink, the ac is turned off (100 degree temps outside), there's no note or any indication that they were coming back, that they had finished, or even that they were there. I had to call the rental office to see if they were finished. ACTUALLY I had to call three times. The first time I called to see if they were done, and the lady said they would be back. I then got a call from someone else at the office saying they were finished. And THAT was right before my ac unit started leaking again, so I had to call again.

Guys, the absolute best part is how quickly they got back to me when I called their corporate number last Friday. They haven't. As of the time of this writing, it has been almost a week since I left a message for corporate to call me back regarding this ridiculous situation.

Maybe they'll care more now.<//review>

Tony is a really helpful and professional person. Marissa, Betty and Paul are really nice and helpful as well. It has been a pleasure calling Avana Apartments my home. Unfortunately I have to change my mind about calling Avana apartments my home since last night(9/7/2018) there was a break in at my garage. I am not sure was going on but lately there has been many crime at this apartments. My husband's tools were stolen. Now I don't feel safe coming from work at night.< /Text>

We loved the way that Emerson was very helpful and polite with us and dedicated time to show us and explain to us the way the transfer would work. The best thing we Love is that Emerson speaks our language and made it very comfortable for us.

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Honestly I wish I could give this place zero stars! We just moved in here 3 months ago and it was the WORST decision I could have ever made. There's water damage in the floors to where they sink when you walk, the ac drips water constantly. The dryer didn't work when we moved in and the water was going through the walls, it took maintenance 2 try's to fix it and they didn't even fix the water damage in the wall! The paint was sloppily put on the walls to where everything sticks to it. Maintenance just comes in whenever they feel like for "emergencies" then when we say we need 24 hr notice (as stated in laws) they suddenly don't come back for days for this "emergency" after saying they were on their way. After days maintenance didn't even fix it, they had to have someone else come in (these are the people working on the place that you're going to be living in btw) We've found cockroaches in our apartment and on the balcony even though we pay for pest control I've never once seen them here (and we work from home) we just went to pay rent and our bank marked it as fraud after talking to the bank we repaid the SAME DAY and they charged us a fee for it bouncing and refused to reverse it! I really wanted to give this place a chance even after multiple screw ups but I'm done trying. They truly don't care about their residents, all they want is the money. But hey they have taco trucks that you can pay for! Just make sure you move your car for them every Monday and Tuesday in a couple of the ONLY visitor spots in the community. I CANNOT WAIT to move out of here, only 10 more painful months. Save yourself the trouble of even touring this place and go across the street to a way nicer apartment for even less!</Text><username>Alex Orser<//username>< user>

< Review>
Out of all the apartments I have lived in over the years, this was by far the worst.  Seems like most of the staff's training is more sales based rather than customer service based.  Mind you we moved out in 2014, so I can't say if things have changed. Upon moving out, I was hit with all sorts of crazy fees. They claim they didn't receive my 30 day notice until five days later and charged me for another five days of rent. On top of that, they claimed I never turned in my parking sticker and charged me a $100 fee!  Almost seems like they use these tactics to make up for the fact that they were the cheapest apartments in that area at the time we had rented.  Now I have derogatory marks on my credit report for unjustified charges.  If you are looking for a place, I would suggest spending a little more for a place that doesn't view tenants as $ since you may end up paying the same amount in the end, after they lay down all their unjustified fees!  I like how they started responding to reviews though, just too bad they don't offer any real solutions. Actions speak louder than words< /Review>

Called Marissa on Tuesday, filled the application and stuff, moved in in the same day, awesome...she was trying to find me place on such as sort notice. me and my husband can have place to stay while our house on reconstruction.

Been living here 1,5 months now, we love this place, especially  when I need something to print and stuff. They provide 2 computers with high speed internet and of course with high quality printer.
Paul helped me set up the printer, while Tony and Betty helped me with stuff I need like papers and connection, they all been helped with everything i need here.
New pool sooooo nice also, my daughter loves new pool area so much.
Its so elegant with new sitting area also.< /review>

I've been here for 10 months, Paul, Bette and Tony are the best, when I have reported issues those are resolved in the next 24 hours, customer service is really good from these guys :)
Be patience if you ask something to the manager it could take up to 28 days to have a response/resolution from her incredible !!!
Overall I recommend this place, my neighbors are very quite and friendly too</review>

This place definitely not recommend it to anyone, not to live or to visit .... The place is lousy, have a security that serves no purpose except to extract money from people, also your vehicle gets vandalize and the stupid security never appears, police gets there and he is never around. but he is there to call the tow truck to have your car tow and other than that  they take it and then you have to pay $ 389.00 for a half hour ...  its definitely an organized crime ... and as they have a sweet deal with the company that collects the cars, go half and half on everything, as they are private property .... Truth is a shame to see such a beautiful place is a nightmare stay .... People open your eyes and don't even think on renting or visiting this lousy place....It could be your worse nightmare.<//text>

<rate>4< /rate><Review>I think it is the cheapest in the area with the option for a studio. The landscaping is nice, never see trash on the lawns or anything. However, their landscapers do blow the leaves into your patio if you're downstairs :( lots of pools, a park, computers with Internet and a printer which is free to use, a gym with decent equipment and they seem to keep adding stuff to the gym which is cool. They do tow cars and have a strict parking policy, but I've followed the ruled they gave and haven't had any problems. Open Parking is tough to find in the evenings especially. They charge extra rent for cats and dogs as well as a deposit for them.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Worst experience living here. Not best place to live. Always having issue after issue. Not safe either. ALWAYS FINDING BUGS INSIDE APARTMENT... ON MY KIDS clean diapers and clean wipes!!!! Apartments are nasty!!!! You always find trash around the community ,   Car got broken into , people are always hoping the gates in this complex.

Had an issue with our bathroom sink maintence guy came in no one was home which we allowed but his tablet ended up in our bedroom  not sure why.. but the maintence guy had the balls to blame us for stealing his tablet..

Would not recommend these apartments can't wait for lease to be up!!!</review>

AWFUL! We moved out as soon as possible. Our downstairs  neighbors smoked pot  all day and night, management did nothing, even though it is a smoke free community. Our upstairs neighbors partied and dropped beer all over our balcony below, again management did nothing. When we moved out we cleaned and made the place spotless and still they took our ENTIRE DEPOSIT and sent  us a bill for more. ABSOLUTELY AWFUL.</Review>

I currently live at this apartment complex , going on my third lease . I won’t say it’s not pricey but for the most part living here has been great . My neighbors never give me any issues , everyone stays to theirselves and the office staff is very friendly. I’ve dealt most of the time with Marissa or tony . Here and there I’ve spoken with Ruben also . Marissa always gets what I need done when it comes to any services or questions in my apartment . Tony is very patient with me sending things in for the contract and also is very friendly. When I first moved in the management wasn’t too nice to speak with but going in to the office now is like a breath of fresh air. Thanks avana and greystar for all that you have done ! It’s well worth the price and experience being able to call this place Home everyday .< /Text>

<text>Pros: Great looking Appartments, good price, nice pools, friendly management, and quick pest service that will come back if needed

Cons: Leasing process is a nightmare, there were cockroaches when we moved in, apparent numbering can make setting up services difficult, no out box for mail(have to go to the office), and the gym has been under construction for months.

It can be frustrating but overall it's a really nice place to live.< /text>< Pics>

Pros:
- In-House washer/dryer and appliances
- Cheap rent (For Rancho Cucamonga area)
- Reserved car port (one car)
- Allows big dogs
- Our neighbors were friendly
- Dog park

Cons:
- Terrible management (Their online portal is constantly down. We constantly got called in due to mistakes THEY made. One month we ended up having to pay $800 extra during Christmas season because they messed up on paperwork back when we first moved in. This was four months later)
- VERY cheap paint, carpet, drawers, cabinets, mirrors and blinds. (We are newlyweds and just purchased brand new pots and pans, bowls, glasses, etc. After one day of leaving them in the cabinets all their paint got stuck to the bottom/rims and we couldn’t get it off fully. We ended up buying mats to lay down on the insides of the cabinets and when it came time to move they got stuck to the insides of the cabinets and made it impossible to clean. We probably got charged because of that. When we first moved in there was paint splotches all over the hardwood floor. After one week of living there we had to put in a request to fix a few different drawers because they were falling off the hinges. Even after they “fixed” it, they felt really lose and very fragile. Our closet mirror constantly kept falling off the tracks. We put in a ticket to get it fixed and when they said they fixed it, it wasn’t truly fixed, just put back on the tracks.
- Pantry space (It's very small, be prepared to purchase your own storage cabinet)
- Outlets are loose and plugs fall out (This is very dangerous for those who don't already know. It can possibly cause arcs without you knowing. I was going to fix it myself, but didn't want to get in trouble just in case there were damages. We had someone come in and fix four of the outlets, however, when they left only three of them were touched and only one was fixed. They actually made one worse and caused the whole wall to lose electricity because they didn't wire it correctly. At this point I took it upon myself to fix it because I wasn't going to wait another 24 hours for them to fix it)
- Bugs (When we first moved in we didn't experience many, if any, bugs. Our last three months living here we constantly found spiders, silverfish, and small weird looking bugs. It made us mad because you pay monthly for apartments to get sprayed)
- Dog owners do not pick up their dog’s poop
- Right next to busy street (you constantly hear want to be race car drivers throughout the night)
- Parking (My wife had the reserved car port and constantly had to call in to the office because people would park in her spot. Most of the time this was after hours so nothing was done and she had to find a public spot)
- They never blow off the second and third floor “hallways” (You can see all kinds of dog hair and dirt built up along the sides)

If given the opportunity we would have left sooner than later, but we were stuck in the contract. I should note that even though management was terrible they were all very friendly in the office.</text>

The parking situation was actually great we never had trouble finding a spot no matter what time of day it was. We sprayed pest control right as we moved in and never had any problems with roaches or spiders, etc. The management was great and very responsive to maintenance requests (usually getting to them the same day). The soundproofing on our apartment was great, we literally never heard our neighbors. And we never saw any homeless people or panhandlers or anything it really felt like a safe place to live.

The only minor complaints we had were people not picking up after their dog poop even though management provided baggies and the office had a little billing mix-up but they took care of it fast enough that it wasn't a big deal.

So yeah, we loved living there and would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for apartments in Rancho Cucamonga.<//Text>< username>

<Review>If only I was just visiting, but my friend offered me a room and I moved in. Right of the top, the parking is just terrifying! I feel as though the apartments are colluding with Steve's Towing for extra profit. It's best to not even have a car here at all. The roaches are bad and the service here is shocking. It's like a bad nightmare that never ends.<//Review>< UserId.>

<Text>If I could leave NO stars, I would. This place is just awful. The element has gone down, they are unorganized, and change hands frequently in regards to who the complex is managed by. I have been here for 3 years and if it is not one thing, it is always another. From the towing, to them doing "work on the asphalt," to the lack of open parking, to the awful maintenance (yard work), to never answering phones, or the turn around in the office of staff. They are WAY over priced for what they deliver on the butt crack of Rancho. Cannot wait to leave. Do not come here if you can avoid it.<//Text>< Pics>

There was an incident in which we were given conflicting information and I wrote a bad review. The day after, Management contacted us personally and rectified the situation. Thanks to Carol, Jamie, Tony and staff for addressing and resolving our concerns.</Review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>horrible place for the money you pay peoples cars are always getting towed away because there is not enough parking. my boyfriend works late hours and every time he comes home his out there looking for parking for like 30 min. if he gets lucky. he got his car towed because he had no other choice but to park in a red zone because he couldn't find parking. and he has a parking permit. $500 to get his car out. water leaks with the dish washer, the tub water takes forever to go down, at one point even the toilet. gym floors are clean, but the machines are filthy. peoples cars are being broken into. the other night i drove by a car had all doors open this was at 11pm no one was there and it looked like it was broken into, my boyfriend received a letter saying peoples cars were getting broken into, apparently there has been lots of complaints. people wait out in their cars until someone pulls out so that they can park, you will see people driving back and forth all night. don't recommend this place, i live in Rancho Cucamonga in a apartment complex too and i never had a problem like this specially with parking. his definitely moving out, and he hasn't been here long all this reviews are correct.  towing cars is their thing! one night here and my car was gone! couldn't get parking permit for 2nd car or motorcycle. he has only been here 7 months and spoke to a temp in the front desk and a person who said they would only be there for a week who the hell are you suppose to come to when their is a issue when they are always being replaced ????????????</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<rate>1</rate><Text>When it is all said and done I was very hesitant to move into the Waterbrook apartment in Rancho Cucamonga.  The leasing agent Obdulia was very unprofessional when I finally met with her.  We had scheduled to do paperwork and come to a leasing agreement at the opening of the office at 9am.  She was 45 minutes late and was not concerned or apologetic about her tardiness.  She convinced us to do a 7 month lease instead of a 12 month lease that we originally wanted.  We were told that the rate would not increase after 7 months and is was better for us because it gave us flexibility.  This was not true, the rent did in fact increase after the 7 months by about $200 ($1150 increased to $1348).  We were not told of any mandatory fees that would be charge at the time of move out.  These included a $50 pet scan and a minimum of $110 for cleaning.  Dealing with the staff on regular matters we were treated more like an inconvenience than a tenant in need.  After moving out our calls were ignored and the senior staff was very reluctant to talk to us.
The apartment was a good size for the price we were paying and the location was great for us.  Unfortunately our apartment reeked of cigarette smoke from the previous tenant.  After several complaints and being told the smell would go away we grew accustomed to the smell but it never went away.  Every guest we had would immediately complain of the smell.  The bathroom was poorly painted and had an ugly pipe that leaked black sludge.  Our outside storage had a creature living in it that left dead snails in the storage and on our porch.  We complained, had the place sprayed, but the creature was still living there.  The carpet in the bedroom didn’t fit properly and made it impossible to close the closet until I fixed it myself.
My complaint about the maintenance was just the fact that it would take as many as three missed appointments until they would come to fix issues.  The staff themselves were polite and fixed all issues in a timely manner.
The apartment had plenty of parking compared to other complexes.  The issue is there is not enough guest parking, no guest parking passes, and unmarked cars were towed on a regular basis.  It was very inconvenient to have guests based on the fact their car might be towed.
My final and biggest complaint is the unethical and excessive bill that included $980 in charges after we moved out.  We left the apartment cleaner that when we moved in.  Upon moving in the floors and cabinets were dusty and the place smelled of cigarette smoke.  After moving out the place was dust free and after excessive cleaning of the vents walls and carpet the cigarette smell we almost nonexistent.  Minimum cleaning charge was $110.  We lived there for 7 months, paid for 6 months of utilities, but they wanted to charge us for 2 additional months.  $130 due for utilities.  Painting fee of $25, not excessive and we did hang some nails in the wall.  Pet scan of $50.  We went not informed of this charge when we moved in or while we were moving out.  $50 for keys, I lost one and it is my fault but $50 is too high for 1 key.  And last but not least $615 for new carpet.  They are claiming the undamaged carpet needed to be replace due to pet urine.  They gave us a pH of 8 but after research I was able to find pet urine should be around 6pH.  8pH is more in line with cigarette smoke damage not pet damage.  They claim the carpet cost $700 and we owed them a prorated cost.  Now doing some research it is easy to find carpet between $0.35 and $2 per square foot.  We only had about 100 feet square of carpeting.  So anything over $200 is excessive.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80c335dc129d6cb9:0xed70d4d641a4139e< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>This apartment complex is completely HORRID. Never have I lived in a place where they make you feel like you are not at home. I certainly think that paying $1000 a month for a studio means that you should provide the utmost service when necessary. Instead this location likes to milk you even more through ridiculous fees, like being charged $100 if you get locked out of your apartment after hours. Also, don't even think you could have friends spend the night without a penalty. There are about 5 visitor spots, per every two buildings, and if your friend is not in one of those parking spots then prepare to pay $400 the next day for them to get their car back because they will tow cars overnight, like creeps. To add on to this unforgettable disaster, I have breakfast with roaches because this place is infested. I regret moving out of my parents house, for this! I mean come on its Rancho!<//review>< Pics>

<name>Event Summit< /name><Review>**Warning, the buildings are extremely old and thus the walls and ceiling are paper-thin. You will hear EVERY SINGLE STEP and over-all sounds from the level above you. I am woken up at night to gentle footsteps, which are thunderously amplified by the old cracking ceiling. Don't let the new coat of paint fool you. The buildings are over thirty years old and has not been reinforced. If you can spend 50 dollars more for rent, please do yourself a favor and move into the Verano apartments next door instead as their buildings are newer and their ceilings are not breaking-down. The rent is high but not worth it. I have been here only a few months and have been broken into twice. It is not safe. There are homeless constantly breaking into the buildings. Unfortunately though,  I'll never live in these apartments again because I can find better for $50 a month extra. I would not wish anyone go through what I am experiencing right now. It is extremely uncomfortable. You have been warned. Stay away! Management however, is extremely friendly, helpful and caring. I just wish they were willing reinforce the inconvenience thunderous dilapidating inconveniencing ceiling.

*update: 5/24/17: The prices on their website have dropped, probably because of low ratings and retainment difficulties. I unfortunately, am still paying over $150 than the current low available price.< /Review>< Rating>

•	Predatorily towing of guest vehicles.

<Text>Moved here one year ago. Its ok but for the price i think they should do alot better. The pool areas are full of flies and always messy. Grass and leaves in pool area are never cleaned up so it ends up in the pool. The tables are always dirty and sticky, under the tables are full of spiders and spider eggs. The restrooms in the pool area are always dirty and toilet in one of the womens restroom doesn't work. Cigarette butts on the floor and beer bottle tops even though signs say no alcohol or smoking. No security ever seen and no security checks in pool area.People from outside who do not live here have gone into bathrooms at the pool area and do what they do and leave. You need a key to get into the pool area but ive seen them simply reach over the gate and open the door. It makes me nervous because i have kids and safety isnt great here.The front gates are left open daily so anyone can come in. And the bugs, bugs everywhere! Spiders in our apartment and spiders and spider webs on our stair case. Ive never seen anyone spraying outside so i dont think its done routinely if at all. Killed another big black spider in our bedroom today..again.</Text>< Name>

The Towing rules are crazy!!!! don't move in. The way they treat and tow the RESIDENTS who live at this complex blows my mind. I have never seen such a unreasonable towing policy. The appt is also remodeled extremely cheap. the paint is peeling 1 one. Everything looks very nice at first but once you look closer you notice how poorly the work was done. If you look at your lease you will notice that YOU will be the one to pay to repaint this crappy paint job after you leave regardless of the condition you leave it in. The rooms travel sound because the buildings are old, so you will hear EVERYTHING from the people above you(or to the side for that matter). The buildings are also not marked so good luck having anyone find your place to come visit. (it wouldn't matter anyways because they would probably get towed)<//text>

< Review>
Worst place to live,  in 6 months of living here I learned the importance of reading reviews, although alot of reviews are just negative because someone is mad or irrational,  I can assure you the bad reviews here are legitimate.
The office staff is rude, they are constantly being replaced,  had 3 different managers in the time we lived there, the parking is horrid,  if you have more than one car and get home on a weekend after 10pm,  you will be parking in a handicapped spot,  as that is all that is available,  roaches were not all over but we seen them often enough, and out apt was spotless..  the noise here,  everyday somebody would lay on their horn for 2 min straight,  no big deal other than you hear everything outside through the thin walls, especially the drunk neighbors fighting with their boyfriends..  from day 1 of move in we had a rotted floor in laundry area,  when we moved out it still was not fixed yet,  some yellow grime would run down the walls in the bathroom due to the steam,  scrubbed it off multiple times, kept coming back,  first week there while out of town out ceiling begins leaking due to leaves in gutter,  ceiling had to be tore down and fixed,  door to apt was so hard to open I would have to put a shoulder into it ,  had them come try to fix it,  maintenance guy couldn't figure it out so that's how it stayed..  if you own a motorcycle they will not give you a parking permit for it,  if it can't fit in your spot with your car, then it will be a target to get towed,  the gates here never worked correctly throughout our stay,  the entrance gate in front never closes, just the exit, so don't assume they are keeping anyone out,  the rear gates never worked to enter other than when the residents would open and disable them..  the pools,  people here I guess figure a baby in a diaper totally should be in the pool,  that is totally disgusting, but seems common there.  Mail service,  so if you get a package from ups and it goes to the office,  don't expect a call,  they won't notify you at all.
The air conditioning in the apt when it kicked on was real loud,  got used to it but took some time.  Just assume that if you live here your chance of being towed is high,  steves towing trolls through there alot and seems they do have a great deal between them and the apt complex for making money off your tow bill..  you will not get help with your problems in your apt,  the maintenance guys are nice and helpful,  but the horrid office staff is too lazy to relay messages to them or get them repair orders..  this complex looks good from far,  but is far from good,  I absolutely hated this place ..< /Review>

<text>Moved into Apartment here at Waterbrook and the following bad items occurred:   Maggots on our patio, took 2 weeks to get rid of them and find source.  3rd Story Apartment above us left a bag on patio and it got maggots in it that fell onto our patio, spent 2 weeks keeping them out of the apartment.  Water leak from 2nd story apartment came into our apartment, used dishwasher 1 time now that is being replaced, no fan in bathroom when moved in.   Then when spoke to Management about our apartment, no one knew that the washer and dryer are in the master bedroom???

Waterbrook Apartments are the worst ever. I have been a tenant here for the past three years  and They have the worst possible customer service if any at all. Regardless if you pay your rent on time and I've been a tenant here for years they will not treat you with respect are any professional courtesy. Do not move there!  Worst apartment in Rancho!!!<//Text>

You finally came up with a more reasonable pricing! Been a client for 17 years but the last couple of years my fee has been over $300! Considering it took my tax professional a half hour ( I specifically asked) that meant your were charging $600/ hour!!! Yes, I understand you don’t charge by the hour but, equating it that way is the easiest way for a layman like myself to understand the relative value of your service. Thank you for making it easier to continue with  H&R Block.</Review>

<Text>Our tax consultant was easily accessible, caring and gave us great future advice for filing taxes. Evelyn Strube had a great turn around time, walked us through the new online approval and helped us understand our return and value we ar receiving back. The time frame in which she did this was incredible and we would refer H&R Block because of the efficiency that was shown by Evelyn Strube and her dedication to her clients and their families.<//Text>< pictures>

It was so nice to have someone like Evelyn who has such a knowledge of taxes.  This is our 2nd year of itemizing so it was a little over our heads so we are thankful for her.  The office was very clean and quiet.  The receptionist was very friendly and helpful!<//Review>

<text>Two reasons: Tracy Hatton. We will follow her to any H&R Block she's working each year. This year, we have a 2nd reason, Mary (didn't get her last name). She was at the front desk and went above and beyond to help us with our 3 year old daughter while we filed our taxes. Unbelievable customer service and care.< /text>< time>

<Review>Evelyn knows my tax peculiarities and knows what to do with them regardless of the curve balls. She gives me peace of mind that what I am claiming are legitimate deductions.< /Review>< GmapID>

<text>Awful Service from Evelyn, I went to see her in Early January , she told me I should receive my refund by the end of February. I paid for additional protection from H&R service to handle any potential issues that may occur; got a letter from IRS on February 26th that they needed to have a 1095-B form that was time sensitive of 20 days, went to H&R Block at this location the very next day I received the letter February 27th, H&R Block told me to go to Covered California to get the form, dropped it the very next hour March 2nd , Mellissa from that office called me 17 days later on March 19th telling me I need to pay them another $35 in order to send the form to the IRS, by this time, the time to receive the refund expired, so I got zero refund; and their attitude sucks, their service sucks, horrible business DO NOT come here, total waste of money and time.</text>< userid>

Trevor is someone who deserves to be commended for his honesty, integrity, and helpfulness.  Trevor reached out to me to give a helping hand with my Trademark application after a Final Refusal from the USPTO.  Without hesitation, he shared the solution even before retaining him as my trusted lawyer.  I highly recommend Trevor based on his integrity alone and am committed to using him for any issues that pop up concerning my business in the future.  Though I started the Trademark application alone over 8 months ago, I’ll not go it alone in the future!  I found it confusing and riddled with unfamiliar terminology as well as a difficult and stressful process to navigate.  It is my recommendation to start with Trevor as he’ll lead you through from beginning to end without the stress and confusion you will otherwise endure.

Thank you Trevor!  I’m forever indebted to you for your help & guidance!!</text>

Trevor was fantastic. My initial request to trademark my business was in question. I contacted Trevor about filing on my behalf. He did a great job walking me through the process and he re-filed my application in no time. His fee was more than reasonable and he was able to help me get my business name trademarked. I highly recommend Trevor for all your copyright and trademark needs.< /Review>

<text>Trevor was FABULOUS!!! Trademarks are complicated. Trevor made the process very easy. I found Trevor through an email he sent. I normally wouldn't even click on the email but I was over my head with the legal information and I just needed a little help. A quick message and Trevor was ready to help. Trevor was trustworthy, upfront, efficient, easy to work with and underpriced- worth every penny (and more). I am thrilled the Trademark was approved and headache free.  I trust Trevor Caudle Law Practice and would refer and use them again. Thanks again Trevor!</text>< Pics>

<Review>Trevor is an exceptional attorney to work with.  He helped us with our Trademark registration and kept us informed of everything during the process.  When I was nervous about emails from other entities trying to solicit their services because there was a response needed, Trevor was wonderful in letting me know that he was on top of everything and I had nothing to worry about!!!!  I will definitely use Trevor again.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1625502350938, 'text': 'Thank you Shari!'}< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Trevor was extremely responsive, polite and professional throughout the process, and ultimately, because of him, we were able to get our trademark approved. I don't think more than an hour would go by without hearing back from him at any given time. His upbeat personality throughout this long process and constant updates/communication, made this feel like a breeze compared to what I had originally anticipated. I am so pleased that I decided to go with Trevor. I would highly recommend him to anyone needing this type of service. Thank you, Trevor!!<//text>< Pics>

I thought, I can do my trademark by myself and BIG MISTAKE. Trevor helps me to fix it everything quickly, explaining to me. Great communication and professional. I can't wait to work with him again. I recommend to everyone 5*******. Thank you so much.</text>

Trevor deserves the highest recommendation! If he reaches out to you -- it's the real deal (SO many people and companies reached out to me... but Trevor's email was so direct, succinct, and personable that I was compelled to choose him.). We should all be wary of scams and fakes... and if YOU are, rest assured that Trevor is a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get). Not only does he work proactively and quickly - but his attention to detail helped me avoid a potential mistake in my filing. This is your guy.</text>

I had hit a brick wall and practically given up on obtaining my much needed trademark. Then Trevor Caudle entered the scene. With his out of the box approach, determination and experience, my issues were resolved ASAP.  Having this well spoken, confident, savvy professional on my side was and is big time game changer. Don’t waste your time and money elsewhere, Mr. Caudle is the real deal!< /review>

I worked with Trevor to form a new LLC, as well as on a trademark for my new company. Trevor was awesome on all fronts. He’s easy to understand, thorough, knowledgable, and professional. On top of that he’s personable, fun to work with, and just a really nice guy. He was always available to answer any questions that came up, was quick to respond, and he came to feel like a trustworthy extension of my team. I will be glad to work with him on any future legal matters that come up and I have no hesitation in recommending him to others. I’d give him 10 stars if I could! Highly recommend!< /Text>

If I Could Give Him 10 Stars, I Would!

Let me start by Thanking him for getting me out of a hairy mess. I created myself, by filing with uspto on my OWN!  Luckily for me I came across Trevor. Very fast response  and very quick to get the situation under control.  He was able to get my application approved, I can’t thank him enough! Thank you, if your looking to Trade mark your brand he’s your Guy!</review>

Put simply? Trevor Caudle is the man. I have worked with lawyers who bill in fifteen minute increments for phone consultation. For one flat fee, Trevor will correspond via email and teleconference, when necessary. He is very specific about what you need to do to trademark your business slogan and will keep providing feedback on your samples until he knows that the USPTO will approve his submission on your behalf. Put simply? Trevor delivers results. I got my trademark. ‘Nuff said.</text>

Trevor was a compassionate human being in a sea of trademark law sharks. He understood what was needed to get my trademark renewal approved after it had been denied, and he fixed my errors - at a reasonable price.  I will definitely contact him again if I need more help.<//text>

He ensured that I was in the loop for any updates and kept everything moving in the right direction. I can't appreciate his guidance enough throughout the whole process. I would highly recommend his service to anyone who's looking to trademark for their business.</review>

<text>Highly recommend!!! Trevor helped me set up my s-corp consulting business as well as my first contract with a client. He is fantastic.

I really appreciated Trevor's depth of knowledge, transparency, and the way he made it all easy for me. His pragmatic approach was exactly what I wanted, and his working style (laid back, but with serious attention to the things that matter) meshed well with my working style and needs. Huge bonus that Trevor is also a genuinely nice person!

I have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending Trevor Caudle to anyone with business legal needs.<//text></record></dataset><record>

I found Trevor via mutual client, and after reading a few of his reviews on Yelp and on Google, I thought: "what kind of man has a PERFECT five star score after 50 Yelp reviews?? What type of sorcery is this?"  Nope - no sorcery, and yep Trevor just is that good.

I had been working under a simple DBA for a couple years, made the decision to incorporate and having read one ENTIRE self help book on corporate law I was of course an expert so I was hesitant to employ someone for that which I could effortlessly do myself.  (yes, that's sarcasm, for those in the back)

I worked on my bylaws for months; going back and forth between the bylaws and articles - changing this or that, rephrasing the legalese as best as I knew how, tediously researching each word one by one as I sludged through the process.  (yeah I know sludged is not technically a word, but it feels so right)

The realization that I needed help was not an acute apprehension - I would say it was more of a dull, painful brooding like walking with a thorn in your shoe for miles before finally realizing you can simply stop and remove the thorn. (duh)

Two minutes on the phone with Trevor was all I needed to know that the incorporation process was secure.  I didn't even ask all my questions - I didn't need to; Trevor was smart, responsive, accessible, resourceful and down to earth. These are more or less the qualities I look for whenever I need to engage in any business endeavor.

Conversely, all those lawyers who love to wave their fancy diplomas around like flags, who have SAT scores posted on their websites, an office wall full of awards or the fact that some highfalutin lawyer markets himself as a MENSA member means exactly nothing to me, except that I would expect the MENSA membership cost to be built into the fee scale -- no thank you.

However, the qualities Trevor possesses inherently, all of which are plainly evident, mean everything to me as a discerning businessman because they basically guarantee success - I knew right away Trevor was going to make sure every thing was taken care of, which really took the pressure off of me so I was able to focus on process, the books, marketing, etc etc etc.

After deciding to hire Trevor to incorporate my company I had an overwhelming feeling of relief - THANK GOD. I have never been happier about spending $$ as I did the day I hired Trevor Caudle -  KNOWING that everything would be done correctly and that nothing would be overlooked: PRICELESS. Thanks Trevor for the peace of mind.< /Text>

<text>Trevor Caudle is fantastic. He's friendly, responsive, fast, and knowledgeable. He was able to give me same-weekend turnaround on an urgent matter for my consulting company with no previous warning or history of working with him, and was able to help me nail down the specifics on an important contract. On top of all of that, he was reasonably priced.

<Review>We enlisted Trevor's help in registering the trademark for our new software application. (I'd found his name in a book all about branding.) Trevor was responsive, knowledgeable, thorough, and attentive. He was very clear about what services he was providing for a flat fee. He clearly has a lot of depth and expertise in navigating the somewhat labyrinthine process of the US Trademark Office. And he gave excellent advice in any of the follow through that was and will be necessary over time. I can't recommend Trevor highly enough!</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

I gained so much insight from him during that first phone call, which led me to hire him for a variety of business needs. Trevor is responsive to emails and calls and easy to talk with as he has a friendly and down-to-earth yet professional manner which I very much appreciate. I highly recommend Trevor as your business lawyer!</review>< Pictures>

We were lucky to find Trevor when we started our purchase of our business in San Francisco. Not being from the area meant that we needed someone who really understood the ins and outs of the city, and Trevor delivered in spades.

He was knowledgeable, communicative, and always quick to respond when we needed him. I also appreciated how up front he was about his pricing and costs associated with filings and how he was able to explain our needs clearly in a way that we could understand. I would 100% recommend his practice to anyone who needs a fantastic business attorney.<//Text>

As a small business owner I need an attorney who understands me, my business and can respond quickly.  Trevor has been a tremendous asset to me and my company assisting with various matters that come up from time to time, but especially in the review and counsel relating to contracts.  He's a talented attorney, direct, straightforward and honest. I highly recommend Trevor.<//review>

I initially reached out to Trevor last year when I first began exploring how to officially start my first business.  We had a good conversation and he explained things to me in a very easy to understand manner, however it wasn't a good time for me to start right then.  When I finally got around to it again, I remembered how helpful Trevor was and immediately reached out to him again to see if he would be able to assist me in the process.  Thanks to Trevor's ability he guided me through the process of starting a business for the first time, explaining all the paperwork and setting me up for success in the future.< /Text>

My accountant referred me to Trevor to assist with some legal  business matters. I am writing this review to confirm that my experience in dealing with Trevor was very positive and I would recommend him to my family and friends. Trevor was very professional, affordable, and he laid everything out for me and my wife very clearly from start to finish. Trevor did exactly what he said he was going to do and made the entire process seamless and worry free.  Thanks for humanizing our transaction.</text>

<Text>Trevor is a knight in shining armor! After I wasted much time trying to complete the process of submitting specimens to obtain a Statement of Use on my own, I failed to notice the time sensitive Office Actions that were issued! I nearly shot myself in the foot and didn't even know. When I hired Trevor, he recognized the totality of my situation, and he even took time to educate me on the mess I had created. He helped me develop an effective plan-of-action and took care of everything! There was never a moment when I felt like he didn't have my best interest at heart. His professionalism and attention to detail are unmatched! He's got a client for life.<//Text></record>

I attempted to file a trademark on my own and quickly realized that it was going to take me way too long to understand how to file it correctly. I reached out to Trevor because of his 100+ Yelp reviews as a trademark attorney in San Francisco. He was extremely knowledgeable, able to answer all of my questions without hesitation, and he filed the trademark 24 hours. He seems like a genuinely caring person which is always reassuring and enjoyable to do business with.< /Text>

I was trying to get my brand trademarked but  the government has a way of making things difficult.   They sent me a letter with a bunch of codes on it saying that I needed to comply.   I blinked twice, shook my head and reached for the phone.    I found Trevor's number and in a free consultation he told me exactly what it meant and how to do it myself and even said.  "You can do this.. You do not really need me.    Those were the magic words.  "You are hired!!"   He outlined what I needed, I handed it to him and in a couple of months I was happily trademarked.    Nice man and honest?     Are we sure he's a lawyer?    Thank you Trevor!  I'm very grateful!</review>

He took me through the process from start to finish and explained every step. Trevor is very knowledgable...every question I had he knew the answer.

Trevor has been a fantastic resource for our entrepreneurial and growing business.  He is responsive, efficient, and applies an appropriate perspective for an organization like ours which is focused on B2B technology and IP.  Our contracting process is so efficient that it requires little of Trevor's assistance.  As much as it is a pleasure to interact with Trevor, I do appreciate keeping our fees manageable.  It is great to have a big aspect of our business...legal protection and compliance...that we do not need to worry about.  Thanks Trevor!<//review>

<Text>Trevor is a thorough professional who knows the law. That usually is enough. Except he is also a genuinely nice person who truly cares about his clients. He has given me expert advice that has saved me a lot of time and trouble. For all your business needs look no further...call Trevor Caudle.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I've never met a Trevor I didn't like.  This is especially true of Trevor Caudle, Esq.  He is personable and precise in his recommendations, saving you money where it makes sense while serving your immediate needs.  His knowledge is vast and far reaching.  Trevor has the ability to research any issue quickly, yet accurately.  I will be using Trevor Caudle's services, again!</Text>

<Review>Trevor is an excellent attorney.  He offers expert advice on tough legal situations and is a great coach when a behind the scenes approach is needed to get the best outcome for all.  He takes a collaborative approach to the struggle. He also leans towards guiding you to deal with the issue directly with the right words/phrasing so you can avoid the higher fees of getting two lawyers haggling it out.  He's a great guy, readily available, and down to earth.  I'd definitely run to him if I ever have a legal situation to navigate.<//Review></record>

Trevor's great! We've been using his services for our small business for 6+ years now and he's never failed to respond instantly to an email, is always prompt at reminding us about our annual filing & any other legal items we should be on top of and is extremely personable & down to earth, while still giving you the utmost confidence in his knowledge & abilities. I wouldn't hesitate for a moment to recommend him to friend, family or stranger.<//text>

<review>Trevor has been with me since 2009. He formed my very first corporation and has done the formation of quite a few of my business endeavors. I’ve referred him to a lot of my friends and he has helped all of them as well. He is very knowledgeable and is always there for you when you need answers. I highly recommend him.< /review></record>

I was trying to get my brand trademarked but  the government has a way of making things difficult.   They sent me a letter with a bunch of codes on it saying that I needed to comply.   I blinked twice, shook my head and reached for the phone.    I found Trevor's number and in a free consultation he told me exactly what it meant and how to do it myself and even said.  "You can do this.. You do not really need me.    Those were the magic words.  "You are hired!!"   He outlined what I needed, I handed it to him and in a couple of months I was happily trademarked.    Nice man and honest?     Are we sure he's a lawyer?    Thank you Trevor!  I'm very grateful!< /Review>

You can't ask more from a lawyer than what Trevor provides. He was instrumental in incorporating my business. He is extremely knowledgeable, personable, able to put legalese in layman's terms, and is unbelievably responsive to emails and phone calls. When there is an area in which he doesn't have expertise, he lets you know and is happy to refer you to others.

I can't more highly recommend Trevor Caudle as a lawyer!</Text>

I was referred to Trevor by a business associate of mine as I needed help setting up my LLC. Trevor was awesome. He stepped my wife and I thru the process and then set everything up for us. Additionally he then took us thru the do's and dont's of owning and operating an LLC which I feel really have us a good jump start in our knowledge and first steps. He has a great communication style and really comes across as real and genuine! I highly recommend Trevor for your legals needs.

<Text>Trevor has been my lawyer for 4ish years. He's advised me on many topics including contracts and incorporations. He has advised me very well and has been great to work with. I appreciate Trevor in particular because he's positive, very clear about what the law states, and also can put the law in a business context to help me make the best legal decision for my business. He's also highly ethical. I highly recommend working with him.< /Text>< pics>

We are so glad we found Trevor to help us purchase our restaurant and form our business.  We would not have been able to do this without him and will continue to use his services in the years to come.  Highly recommend!<//review>

You can't ask more from a lawyer than what Trevor provides. He was instrumental in incorporating my business. He is extremely knowledgeable, personable, able to put legalese in layman's terms, and is unbelievably responsive to emails and phone calls. When there is an area in which he doesn't have expertise, he lets you know and is happy to refer you to others.

I can't more highly recommend Trevor Caudle as a lawyer!< /Text>

I'm a CPA in the east bay and have referred several clients to Trevor.  He is a great attorney and has a lot of knowledge around entity setup and other small business issues.  I trust that he has my client's best interest in mind and highly recommend him for legal matters you may be facing.< /Review>

I suddenly found myself quite dissastissfied with my wireless carrier and wanted to talk to someone who could help explain my options for an upgrade to a new phone with a new company. I was randomly in the area and normally wouldn't have stopped at this location. First, they do a great job with helping their employees and customers stay safe - they take their virus protection seriously which is something I appreciate.

Kris (?) was the salesperson I was paired up with and she was awesome. She was clearly very informed both with what her company's options were but also with the company I told her I wanted to break away from. She was able to answer all of my questions about possibly switching to T-mobile.</Review>

<Response>None</Response><time>1440896965855< /time><Review>I usually come in during the early afternoon to avoid busier hours, but the store is so understaffed I still end up waiting about 15 minutes for one of the two employees at the rear desk to be available.

Their help is consistently attentive and helpful, but the wait is long enough that I may as well pick up a buzzer like what Red Lobster gives to waiting parties.

Edit: Came in recently to get a new phone, as my current one no longer works. The one I came in to get was out of stock, and the options suggested to me were:

-Why not get a different phone?
-You can send your current phone in and get the exact same model shipped back to you some time this week.
-You can pay to have the one you want shipped here. It'll arrive next week, maybe. You can also pay extra to get it sooner.

How is your store being out of stock my responsibility? If you don't have something, you should order it. Lazy suggestions and non-solutions. I'll take my business elsewhere.< /Review>< gmap_id>

I love this T-mobile store. Friendly, helpful and knowledgeable staff and this is saying a lot as I'm pretty tech savvy myself when it comes to mobile devices. I highly recommend if you need to change your service provider from, oh, I don't know, AT&T perhaps ;)< /Review>

I actually caught one of these reps try to lie to me and when i asked him to remove a service on my line that I no longer needed. I didn't call him out on it since i didn't feel like making a scene. I told him i wanted a printout for proof that the service was removed. He told me he didn't have a way of doing that. I asked him to show me on the computer what the process was for performing such a thing and when he tried to show me i clearly saw the service still attached to my account. He quickly tried to scroll away before I asked him, "So, what's that??", which he then tried to play off as if it was the computer's fault.... Some great customer service there T-Mobile. These guys need some training in integrity. They need to realize that the customer pays their salary.<//review>

< review>
I wish I hadn't grown up before cell phones were commonly sold online a shipped to your door. I got used to going in to phone stores to buy cell phones and while I have adapted well to most aspects of modern Amazon/Facebook fueled life, the damn cell phone store is my kryptonite. I can usually find better prices online but for some reason my stupid brain stops me from ordering and drags me down to the T-Mobile store where I fumble with phones attached to the wall with cables. Some even work. After looking at all the phones I will inevitably decide on the one I saw online and then resolve to go back home and order it. Before I can get out the door, my scumbag brain convinces me that since I drove to the store, maybe I should just shell out a few extra bucks and go home the phone that day. After a little back and forth with the sales guy we work out the details and it then takes an unusually long time for him to finish up at the register. At the end if it all the salesman runs my card and then informs me that they don't have my phone in stock and that it will be arriving by mail within the next week. I go home and wait for the package and try to figure out why I paid more to get it later than when Amazon could have had it to me. Damn it! Oh well, the store is nice and clean and the people are nice and they are no more or less helpful than the staff at any other cell phone store in America. Good selection of accessories.< /review>

I recently switched to T-Mobile and their stores have the best service of the Big 4 US carriers. The staff are friendly, service is prompt and most popular phones are in Stock.</text>

Always overcrowded. They've put me on the waiting list, and then skipped me like 4 times. I politely aksed why is that so, because I clearly saw my name on the list and heard them calling people below me, and they tried to explain mr that didn't happen. AND they continued calling the people below me after that. I lost my patience and decided to leave. I won't be coming back there! Very unprofessional!< /review>

I believe that the previous post claiming that this store is staffed with lazy employees is a lie that was posted by someone who either works at the store located at 105 E. Alameda Ave. Burbank, CA 91502 or someone who is a friend of an employee from the E. Alameda location. Why, because the staff of all Armenian men who work at the E. Alameda location are very mean spirited and rude.
I just interacted with this location which is at Palm and San Fernando Rd. in downtown Burbank, CA and the employees were polite and courteous. Also the manager was very helpful to me.< /review>

<Review>Bunch of lazy good for nothing's standing around chit chatting. Very professional. So professional that without even looking at my phone they can assume it's not defective. This was the last straw T-Mobile, I'm officially canceling all my lines and going with Verizon.

I bought my phone here about a month ago, that  day there are not  any customer... about one week later i came ahisn to buy the sd card  , a one young guy attached  it to my phone but just that . It did not get any help , wherever  I eat to download any app , my phone would say  it doesn't have enough  storage... And this evening I have trouble with  voice  call. I can hear  the one who called me but no one could hear me.i am at the store now to ask for help . But they all are very busy with selling new phone and no one want to take my case.  I can't believe that is the way that the T mobile store treat Customer. Especially  the guy take Customer names to call.... he is just deliberately  chooses  Customers for sellers..</review>

Went into to the store to buy phones for my brother's business and was told that I couldn't even though I am an authorized user with the capabilities to do so.  I even asked why, and was given an irrational reason. Went to another TMobile shop and was helped accordingly. I have no idea what they were thinking or doing in there. Granted this happened 6 months ago, I still plan on avoiding this particular store until at least 2018.<//Review>

High quality finds with proceeds going to displaced women and children in need.

The best kept secret in Lodi after the lake. I’m a customer for life.

If you have stuff that is too good to throw away but not new enough to sell online, bring it here! One man’s clutter is another person’s lifesaver or Christmas gift for their kid!<//text>

<review>My all time favorite thrift store! I am the queen of thrift and this is the highest quality, most turnover of good stuff, and best prices ever!! I have 8 young grandchildren I buy all their presents at Lodi House. My home is furnished with Lodi House. Seriously! The best thrift store.

The people working here are very polite & their dressing rooms are amazing. I like that the store is small & is well organized. It makes it easy to go through everything without being drained of energy. Another thing I love is where the money spent goes to. All in all, this is one of my favorite places to stop.<//review>< pics>

The clothes are well marked and are very will kept in order not like some of the major department stores!  Yes it's a thrift store but the personal are very willing to help you and tell you they don't have something right now but come back later and we might have what you are looking for.   When they run a sale you can't go wrong.  I bought a pair of jeans 36 X 34 yesterday and the price was $7 but I also received 60% off because of a sale on mens clothes.  The pants look like they might have been washed once!   Great deal for $2.80!   I'll be back.<//review>< Gmap_id>

<review>The staff are very nice while they treated me like I was a thief. They made me very uncomfortable the way they followed me around. It felt like a pink elephant in the room.

<Review>I have never had a bad experience here and  I thift very often.  but today one of the cashiers asked me if i could give them my back pack when i first walked in. Which is fine if its a new policy i dont mind. But what struck me as very odd was another customer had a backpack similar size as mine the only diffrence  was she was caucasian and im mexican. Lodi already  discriminates soo much you cant even pay your utilities with out it happening. And i was extremely saddened that a place i visit often would do something similar. I dont think ill be visiting thia store anymore<//Review><resp>{'time': 1547513377217, 'text': 'Karen. My sincere apologies for your negative shopping experience today. You are correct and I want to assure you that Lodi House supports your belief that there should not be discrimination anywhere in Lodi.  Our ethnically diverse staff is trained to care for each person that comes into our store, regardless of their beliefs, status or backgrounds. Therefore, it is unsettling to hear that you felt discriminated against and we would like to address this immediately by talking with you in person. It is our desire to correct the situation and avoid this happening again. It is obvious that staff was not consistent in holding the store\'s "No backpack policy" and we will work to remedy that right away.'}<//resp><gmapID>0x809aa01cfd52eaad:0x7cd884ac171c9111<//gmapID><time>1547510291229<//time><user>107229701886518459680< /user><username>Karen koval</username></record></dataset><record>

Great cut, fair prices, and friendly staff. They book up quick I recommend making an appointment I tried to walk in twice as walk in are welcome but they were booked. It's easy to make an appointment online so I totally recommend going that route.<//Text>

<UserId.>101644198002843509595<//UserId.><Review>I don't recommend getting a haircut from Ivan. He doesn't show any certifications, works slow, and needs a lot of clear direction. The haircut I got from him wasn't what I asked for. I wanted it corrected but was pressed for time. His fades are pretty good though. And he's a great conversationalist. I wish him the best of luck in his business. I just wish I could have gotten a haircut from Ivan when he is more experienced and confident.</Review></record>

Hands down Oscar is the GOAT. He is knowledgeable about hair and  invests time to ensure you get the hairstyle you need. I have gotten numerous compliments from random people with my cuts from him. The quality of service that he gives you reflects how energetic he is in his work and I believe that can't be found effectively in somebody else. I have been getting my cuts from Oscar for past 8 years which is longer than I have been at my current job. :D
Highly Recommended Barber!!!< /text>

Have been going to social 💈 barbershop for about 6 months now and Oscar Medina has been cutting my hair. He does a great job and I have referred many of my friends to him including my family. If you need a clean hair cut, a Oscar Medina is the go to guy!< /review>

Been coming to this place for a few months now. I love the fact that you can make an appointment ahead of time instead of just showing up and hoping there isn't a long wait. I was referred to Oscar Medina and he didn't disappoint. His hair cuts are on point and he has always been on time for my appointments. Appointments, on time, great hair cuts by Oscar got me to switch from my long time barber.< /review>

<Text>ROBERT RIOS is the truth!!! He definitely knows what he’s doing he makes sure you get exactly what you ask for. He takes his time and ensures you leave there feeling fresh. I went to Robert as a referral from my friend and that was one of the best things that could’ve happened. If you’re looking for a new barber then he’s it. You’re gonna like the way you look..... I guarantee it (pun intended lol).< /Text>< Pics>

Oscar at the social barbershop is the man! I’ve known him for a few years and he always knocks it out of the park with his cuts. He is very knowledgeable and is the only person I trust cutting my hair. I wouldn’t go anywhere else! The environment is comfortable, modern, stylish, and clean.
I highly recommend making an appointment with him and checking this place out!< /Review>

Having just moved back from the east-coast, I was looking everywhere for a barber that could consistently make me feel and look like a million bucks. After meeting up with Oscar I knew I didn't have to look any further. This dude's barber skills are unreal. I drive all the way from Lancaster bi-weekly and sometimes weekly just to get cut. Five F&*%ing STARS<//review>

<Text>I’m actually not a fan of this place, but people seem to like it. The barbers are awesome though. There’s just this attitude to the place that feels really rather unwelcoming if you’re not a straight, urban style, hip hop millennial. The best barber I’ve ever had, Oscar, is here though, so I keep returning. I just make sure to make an appointment on non busy days, mid week. Forget about walking in on a Friday or weekend for that matter, it’s crowded and busy as hell. Definitely book an appointment.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I have been to the Social Barbershop three times now, each with Oscar Medina, and I always had a phenomenal experience.

When I first came in, I showed Oscar pictures of the look I was going for and also described some past difficulties in achieving the haircut. Oscar broke down exactly what he was going to do and how, and described how I would be maintaining the hairstyle on a day-to-day basis. After the haircut was done, Oscar showed me how to comb the hair and how it would grow into the style I wanted. In the subsequent visits, Oscar kept refining the cut until it turned into exactly what I wanted.

I highly recommend the Social Barbershop--the barbers here are highly skilled in their craft. Thanks again, Oscar!</Text>< Date>

<text>Good atmosphere, clean, respectful employees. I've been getting my hair cut by Rusha for a couple of years and she has done a great job every single time. I value her hair cutting skills very much. I am now living on the east coast and every time I come home to visit family I still make sure to stop by and get my haicut by her before leaving. She truly has a passion for cutting hair and she takes her time with it to make sure it's done right.< /text><Date>1578240324214</Date><Rating>5< /Rating>< Gmap_id>

They do a great job with my son’s haircut every time I bring him in. We’ve had multiple barbers and they are always so gentle and show him all the tools so he can be comfortable. They are so awesome and accommodating.<//Review>

Had an appointment made last minute then had walk in taken instead of appointment. Also had hair cut done but not finished - styled. For the price I paid I expected more but failed to meet my expectations. Will go to GENTS next time.</review>

Great location with wide aisles and s great selection given its moderate size.  Very good prices on high end items. They were selling a bottle of whistle pig boss hog 14 year for a 100 dollars less than anywhere else I've seen.< /Text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><text>Great place to be. Although I wonder why one is carded for buying juice vs. alchohol... one of the workers asked for ID on juice... he may need retraining or at least have better judgement of knowing who appears older than 21 vs. under 21. Aside from this, cool environment with some room for doing screening better. The best practice for business is to do better and acknowledge/accept your mess ups.

< Review>
This store is HUGE. They have almost everything. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. I go here all the time and really appreciate having this store in Jack London. Perfect for the occasional item or tons of stuff for a party (remember when we used to have parties !). Highly recommended.</Review>

Michael was incompetent having absolutely no prior knowledge of a fine Brandy in which I know they carry and rather than look on the computer he chose to take care of another customer since she was White. Seems to me that Bev Mo don't want my business as a great customer since 2008.<//review>

< Review>
I'm ashamed I'm here so often. I think I've turned into a bit of an alcoholic. Giving this place 5 stars cause everyone working here is amazing. All great personalities for a chain bidniss like this. They did a good job early covid also. Shocks me how much people actually started going here during covid. (Look how quickly we judge the needy.) Help the homeless in this area more, kick the privileged techies out. Real geeks are og's but they're more rare nowadays. Be cool and drink by the water. If you don't know about the 2 for 1, 5 cent wine deals, you are missing out on life. Get some bottles, go drink by the water, boom. Perfect night.</Review>

<text>This location is clean, well organized and they have a big variety. The cashier(receipt name "Solo"- I don't think that's her real name)on Saturday July 18th 2020, wasn't very friendly. The guy that grabbed my bottles from the locked cabinets was nice though. I'll probably go to NobHill next time, specially because they always give 30% off when you buy 6+ bottles!</text>< Pictures>

I haven't been writing any reviews since pre-COVID but it's time to start giving shout-outs to those working during this time and helping to preserve a sense of normalcy. I would like to recognize the folks working at BevMo in Oakland at Jack London Square. I've been there several times now and it's a non-stop hustle for them. It appears you can either order online or order at the storefront but you have to know exactly what it is you want. The staff is incredibly helpful and upbeat and the wait time feels nominal. Thank you for your hard work and keeping us well-supplied with our beverage requests, it's vastly appreciated.</review>

You people are probably drunk on you own supplies. Thanks for wasting my time and gas. Don't order online. I ordered and got my email that it was ready to be picked up. Got there and was told they canceled my order because they didn't have 1 of the 7 items I bought. This place is overpriced and very limited on supply. It's also hard to park.</text>

The staff and Security Guard were pleasant to talk with.  It was windy and rainy, so they let us wait inside BevMo for our rideshare after making our purchase.  As always the section was great.</review><Resp>None</Resp><Time>1578236529285</Time><GmapID>0x808f80c7890d9355:0xd0e3552bf0d8c145</GmapID></record>

BevMo! Is and has always been a pretty good adventure to me.  Today's challenge... Finding 2 items for someone else, both of which were pretty difficult to find.  Want a lot of floor help and the one person who finally discovered my puzzled expression did move me out pretty quickly!<//Text>

<Review>i truly loved it, shopping at bev more
was so nostalgic, but something got my attention while shopping at Safeway,I noticed that Glenlivet single malt whiskey and Dewars blended scotch whiskey and other blends was tremendously reduced by as much as $15 a bottle and more.
so I will be shopping @ Safeway for my holiday drinks and saving money as well, I  will not shop bev more unless its absolutely necessary</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x808f80c7890d9355:0xd0e3552bf0d8c145< /Gmap_id></record>

Either for a party or just to replenish your own liquor cabinet at home or as a gift for some special occasion, Bev Mo has it all and then some!
Store is clean and well stocked. And prices are very reasonable.
My only recommendation is to have the Wine or Liquor tasting advertised outside to be going on inside. I was in the store quite a while and I didn't find it if it was going on.< /Review><Rating>5</Rating></record>

I made a reservation for outside and the weather being super hot I wanted to dine indoors and was told that was not an option.
The waiter explained that the food was running behind so advised we order immediately so we did.
The food came out in a timely manner, but we had no napkins or silverware​ so we had to ask​ for them. We were sharing items so we had to ask for additional plates. We had to ask​ for salt and pepper, and ketchup.
Lastly our beverages arrived when almost everyone had finished their food.
The food was fine but I won't rush back to eat here.< /Text>< pics>

One of my favorite stores.  I often come to jack London and like to nip in at bevmo to restock my supply of naughty sauce.  The $.05 wine sale is always stellar.  Loads of hard booze to float your boat.  And beer buy the barrel, literally.  The staff is always nice and glad to help out with this being something.  The store is clean and organized.  Really, you know you want to have a drink.  The worst part is the Netflix effect after being presented with so many choices, it's hard to choose!< /text>

Really large liquor store with a giant beer selection. They even have Maui Brewing Co! Nuts! I just lived there for a year. In fact they have beer from tons of states I have traveled to in the US. Really rad and the prices were not bad. Also everyone was super cool and nice. BevMo! Is pretty awesome!<//Text>

Needs more Cameras, our Car was broken into in the BevMo customer parking lot, lost a light blue Mario backpack with Green and Red mushrooms, power stars, and mystery boxes as the design

Inside is 5 sketchbooks, all dark blue, pencil bags, dnd minis and improvised minis, a blue folder with papers drawings and 3 little notebooks, 3 sets of dnd dice in a improvised dice bag, two little mirrors

And my moms purse was also stolen(dark gray) but the only thing in there was her wallet and her credit cards(she wasn't carrying any money and she cancelled her cards)

I know my stuff doesn't seem as important but to me that stuff is priceless<//Text>

Bait n Switch tricksters. You bring your purchase up to the counter and if you don't have a BevMo card, it's MUCH more expensive than the price listed on the shelf. My Glenfiddich went from $29 to $43. Watch out for these scammers.</review>

This is the place to go for stocking your bar. They have a wide variety of beverages and the largest of late harvest wines. The staff has always been helpful.<//review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>I don't go to BevMo! much at all, let alone any liquor store. But this has got to be one of the largest I've ever seen. I had to pickup 22 bottles of champagne and a wonderfully pleasant girl assisted me on my search explaining the differences and she even helped me find a 2-for-1 deal which helped!

You should be able to find all the major brands you could need and then some here. Large selection. Clean and great ambience. The workers I interacted with seemed friendly enough.< /review>< pictures>

Great liquor store, half of which only sells wines many of which have daily deals. Any kind of liquor you could find and large beer selection in cans and bottles at reasonable prices. Also sells snacks like chips, charcuterie meats, cheese, sodas and various other delicious snack foods.<//review>

<text>There are some great prices on liquors in the BevMo. And for the most part, an enjoyable store. If beer is your thing (not mine), there’s a substantial section. For whiskeys, an average collection, much of which is priced well, som, not so much.

All of that said, it would be helpful if the store could stock up on tonic water - Q, Fever Tree, Fentimen’s. There’s virtually none there. And there are so many great choices available now from all of these brands. And they’re also hard to find in neighboring grocery stores. So, BevMo, step up and get yourself in the G&T game.<//text><rating>3<//rating><Pictures>None</Pictures>< user_id>

It's always great to have a Bev Mo nearby and if you live in Alameda this is the closest one by far. The staff are generally helpful but sometimes the lines get really long so don't expect to quickly swing in to pick up that last minute item. The only reason I rated 4 stars is because the location isn't great and parking is either paid or a pretty lengthy walk.< /Text>
