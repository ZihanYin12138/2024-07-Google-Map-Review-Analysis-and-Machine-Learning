The office staff was very friendly. The grounds & units are very clean. I also feel very confident my belongings are safe because of the security cameras & I noticed locks had been checked. (Not sure if that's a nightly check but reasuring that they would check to see if its been acmcidelty left unlocked or cut. Also like that not only is the gate coded to get in but also to get out. Helps prevent someone sneaking in behind another car being able to get out. Gates access opens at 5am so thats also nice.< /Text>

<Review>Excellent customer service and professionalism! Summer was able to secure a storage unit on the same day for us and we were just getting quotes and prices around Elk Grove.

I made arrangements to arrive at the Laguna West location on Thursday night, I was coming 40 minutes from Natomas, and it was my last day to unload so I could drive back to the Bay Area on Friday.  The office closed at 4:30 without notifying me!  I was stuck and had to drive my van all the way back.
Thank goodness Kyle was there on Friday, called me Friday morning just to check in (thank you!) and made sure I was all set.  Then he made a point to stay until the 6:00 closing time so I could unpack the van, I left really late for the Bay Area drive, but he was so nice and accommodating.
I know you are short-staffed and are not providing services, but at least communication with people who make appointments!   And great job Kyle, he saved me!</text>

Stacey helped me when I first started, he took the time to let me look around at a few different spaces answering all of my questions.

The process was super fast and easy. I would definitely recommend it was probably the easiest process I have gone through when getting a storage unit. Stacie made sure the unit we were getting was not too big or small, making sure it fit our needs. Very customer service oriented and friendly!< /Text>

<Date>1578723487287</Date><review>I spent extra time to look around for a good deal and safe place for storage in Elk Grove. I knew I was at the right place after I met Stacey, the manager, at StorQuest off Laguna. Great customer service skills, respectful, and extremely helpful! He saved a unit for me, showed me around, explained how their security system works, and set everything up for me in minutes. Later Stacey even helped me when I had a problem with my lock. I appreciate that he was understanding even though it was my mistake. While the prices are competitive, the quality of customer service is on another level compared to the competition in town.

I got a 6x9 unit at lower than average rate for 12 months during a promotion. StorQuest property is very clean, spacious, well lit, and has good accessibility times 5am-9pm. They have a security feature that alerts security if a unit is opened by someone other than the owner. I have peace of mind knowing that my stuff is safe here.< /review>< Resp>

<review>I have been with StorQuest for a while now  and have always gotten A1 customer service at this location. I’ve had my share of bad experiences with storage facilities but this facility has been the absolutely best by far. Stacey B.  has always been so helpful and pleasant going above and beyond for me at times and I’m so grateful.  The facility is always clean and intact.  It’s definitely a place you can store your items and have the confidence in knowing that it’s  safe, protected and in a clean location with a staff  that genuinely cares. Thanks Team!! You guys are the best. - - Nicole L.< /review></record>

< review>
I was in need of a quick place to store some things and I was given a glowing recommendation by a friend. They sure didn’t steer me wrong. Walked in and met Jared who was friendly and extremely helpful. The whole process of finding the right storage unit was so easy and incredibly professional.  Jared was great at making sure the unit I chose was the right one for me.
The entire facility is top notch, with LED lighting in the indoor units and I felt safe storing my items once Jared pointed out to me that they have state of the art cameras everywhere.

If you need somewhere to store your items- call StorQuest and ask for Jared. Better yet just go on in and he will take care of you with the utmost professionalism and expediency you need. Thanks!!  UPDATE- Stacey is also incredibly to deal with. Why would you go anywhere else?</review>

Best storage in Elk Grove hands down for affordable prices! I first started off with a larger storage then downgraded to a smaller storage, the process was quick, easy, and hassle free! The manager Stacey and the assistant manager Jared are extremely helpful, kind, and honest. They’re willing to help you figure out what storage would be right for you. Thank you Storequest for a great first time storage experience.</Text>

<review>I arrived late right before closing. I was greeted by Jared with a smile. I told him I wasn't sure what size unit I needed and he offered to show me multiple units. He was patient with me and answered all of my questions. I ended up getting the first unit I saw. Perfect location. Process was super simple and quick. Fast forward to the next today, I lost the key to my lock I just purchased the previous day (yikes). Jared was super understanding. He quickly cut the lock off and replaced the lock ( I did have to purchase another one of course. The price I had to pay for being irresponsible lol ). I recommend this location to anyone looking for a storage in the Elk Grove area.  Super clean, well lit and great customer service.  Thanks Jared!!!</review>< Pictures>

< Review>
My twin sister Dixie has been very ill fr stage 4 cancer and has been looking for the right place to store her precious things .... and we found Storquest in Elk Grove.  First, we were greeted immediately with this handsome smiley super friendly guy named Stacey. He got down straight away to all the details we need to know without us questioning anything. He explained everything  thoroughly and promptly.  He was so nice and accommodating,  everything we needed. Gave us a good price and showed us the surrounds. Honestly, you couldn't ask for a better person to help you especially in our circumstances.  So helpful and super super nice. Storquest needs more staff just like Stacey. Thank you Stacey for your kind and considerate nature. Keep up the good job.< /Review>

Just got a 10x25 unit for 50% off the first month. Facility is clean, climate-controlled. I've used Natomas Self Storage in the past which was a good experience when moving from there to Elk Grove. Have to say StorQuest was even better. Very transparent about rates, taxes already bundled in so what you see online is what you pay. Ask for Jared, dude's service was phenomenal< /text>

They recently changed ownership but the new owners definitely worked hard to provide a frictionless experience changing over! They have great communication, and are definitely looking to provide new tenants the storage services they need. I am long-term at this place because the set-up and staff just feel right. AC'd units are clean and orderly, and outside units have open and inviting spaces to park your car and load/unload.</text>

Been using this facility for a year now. You couldn't ask for better service from a storage unit facility. Everything is always very clean and organized. You can tell the owner/onsite manager cares about his facility.< /review>

I wouldn't shop anywhere else!
It's going through all the motions to keep us safe!
I have no problem wearing my mask and everyone else is too!
Always has great deals and I can really use the savings that are offered!
Good shopping!</review>

Deli chicken was awesome today. Still waiting for the remodel to happen. New floirs,fixtures and lights will greatly improve shopping  experience . Great selection of tortillas too.< /review>

They've updated the store and frankly I liked it better before. Save Mart's overpriced, the only reason I went to spend money there was because I had a coupon. Everybody's nice for the most part I suppose. I'll keep going back as long as I have a coupon.<//Text>

< review>
I used to shop at this particular Save Mart almost every day. It was the store closest to my house. Well, I recently shattered my kneecap & had to stay at a friend's house in town. So I went to do 'big grocery shopping ' twice while I stayed there. It was pretty much the same set up as back in the 90's. There was a lot on sale of the items I was buying. And I definitely got a lot for my money. It's an old store that hasn't had a remodel. It's a little dark, & tho I know it's clean, it looks a little dingy. It's not the store's fault. And there is a 2nd Save Mart on Missouri Flat Rd., that is bright & shiny & clean looking. It's like that store gets all the perks, & this store, since it's around more lower middle class, & lower class home's,  that they don't deserve a bright, shiny remodeled store. I've lived in this town for 40 year's & nothing has been done to brighten up this store? That hardly seems fair. I sure get my money's worth from this store tho. I would love to shop there weekly, but I live a good 20 minutes outside of Placerville. And there is a grocery store only about a mile from where I live. It's more expensive, but they are really good about carrying items that are special requested. I've called their corporate office & requested items for them to carry at this store a few time's. If I lived closer to Save Mart, it would definitely be my main store for grocery shopping. Considering how far out I live, I'm just glad there's a store out here st all. Too bad there isn't a Save Mart out here, too.< /review>

The new look and layout of the store is great! It's not often that Save Mart doesn't have what we went in for and the employees are always so kind and helpful.</text>

I like the much needed upgrade Save Mart did. But now it looks like all the rest of the other Grocery Stores and lacks originality.< /Text>

This Savemart, on Broadway in Placerville CA, has no Bakery or Deli. It has recently put in a new  refrigerated area in the side entrance of the store and has more food choices.< /Text>

Very good grocery store 😁 location, ample parking on two separated lots, great selection on meats, cheese, snacks items, coffee and assorted beverages, to include dairy, juice, soda pop, beer and wine. Also has outstanding balance of 🏕️ camping supplies such as food and beverage coolers, ice chests, charcoal, propane, wood, starter fluid, paper towels, bath supplies. Another plus is that this store location has an inside and outside Red Box DVD and video game kiosks. What more of a selection could you even ask for before your next trip up the mountain. Really, last stop till you get to Lake Tahoe.<//Text>

Normally I would say the prices here are better than most but you really have to watch we got bacon and I wasn't paying attention and it was $10 a package. Not sure if it was something crazy but just didn't like the surprise. People are nice and store is easy to navigate.</Text>

I love this little store. They typically have good produce and a good selection of items even though they are small. The people make the difference - extremely friendly, customer-focused employees.<//review>

Small store. Not the best selection. Good for quick stops for essential items. But then there was only one cashier and 14 people in line... not so quick after all.< /Review>

Clean, super friendly staff, checkers, etc. Great selection of food, good prices, lots of parking and of course .35  cent soda machine outside in front of store. Super cold soda at an awesome price. They just need to put a .35 cent beer machine and I'll give em that 5th star!!</text>

<text>For a small grocery store Savemart in Placerville is convenient if you need to grabs one thing quick. They do not have a deli or bakery and their produce section is minimal.  Their generic items are very minimal so you are forced to buy name brand things that seem to be very expensive.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  Overall it is a decent store if you are shopping for a meal or so but I wouldn't recommend a full grocery shopping for the whole month trip.</text>< Pics>

No inside seating because of covid when most other places offer it.  This is cost savings and has nothing to do with public health.<//review>

<review>I went through the drive-thru, and the kid who was doing my order. He was good but he really needs to slow down. He got the whole entire order wrong, he had to go over the order multiple mounts of times. And he was still missing an item. from their mistakes of messing up the order instead of going extremely fast they should slow it down a tad bit. But then also the fries are really cold and the sandwiches were too definitely not worth the trip.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNyk-T9rDCmtqVKV8CGtCIxihU-rE9kcivzgXz7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
The staff here are always friendly and provide fast service.  I'm a picky eater and usually order "special" orders and I have never received the wrong food made.  The drive through gets real busy at lunchtime so I will order from inside, but since the dining room is closed, I will take it to go.  They always give plenty of napkins too.<//Review>

<text>Even though they advertise serving breakfast until 11 AM on Sundays, this particular McDonald’s stops serving breakfast at 10:30, but they don’t let anybody know that ahead of time when they get in the drive-thru line. It really doesn’t help that they are so incredibly slow at moving people through the drive-thru so that you sit there for a good 15 minutes on average before you find out they’re not actually serving breakfast like they advertised, completely wasting your time. Ridiculous. Hope this place closes.< /text>< pics>

I love Mickey D's. They have so many nuggies. Cunchy crispy delicious nuggies.

Dip them in bbq sauce, dip them in sweet and sour.
Eat them while they're hot, or one for every hour.
Sometimes I eat them alone. Sometimes I share with friends.
Sometimes at the start of my day, or when my day ends.
I eat them with my girl when we are riding her red buggy
or on the couch watching movies with some nuggies and Snuggies

Best quick nuggies ever!<//review>

<text>The manager there (assuming he's a manager) has a jerkish demeanor. I've been here when he's arguing with or demeaning his employees. He always seems stressed and doesn't handle it well. Makes the customers feel uncomfortable.<//text>< Rate>

<Text>The food was good but the manager was very Moody and demanding that people use the self serve kiosk.
He was overwhelmed and handled it poorly. He definitely needs more training to handle stressful situations. Not ready to be manager.<//Text>< pics>

Fun Play Place for kids with lots of seating in the playground area. The staff is pretty attentive and the location is perfect for burning off some kids steam after some local shopping.< /text>

Very understaffed. Drive thru line was crazy so did mobile order. After 5 minutes of sitting in my car for my double cheeseburger, I went in, another long wait and my order was still not ready. Waited a total off 15 minutes for 1 item.<//text>

So disgusting.   This is the dirtiest McDonalds I have been in.  From stuck on debris on counter by register to food and trash all over floor behind counter.   Man behind counter didn't want to take my order and wanted me to order on kiosk.   I refused and left.  Horrible for a McDonalds I would of never expected this.< /review>

The AC is never pumping strong like you expect it at a McDonald's. Muggy, humid, smelly. The play area is neat, but miserable for the parents. Full length windows that make it really hot and stinky with all the little kids. Not enough seating in the kids area.

The coke machine needs to be cleaned because the diet Coke often tastes like medicine or flat.

No napkins available unless you can get someone attention behind the counter so they can give you some. Absolutely no napkins dispensers. How crazy is that?<//Text>

<Rating>3<//Rating><Review>Usually McDonald's drive-thrus are fairly quick I think but not this one. maybe I just hit it at the wrong times but this particular McDonald's always seems slow.but I usually hit it at the end of the day before I'm ready to drive back out to San Bernardino so I have something to eat for the road. Around 6 or 7 pm. So I'm willing to wait sometimes because the later I am the better the traffic is.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

It's a normal McDonald's with the kids playground, however, it was one if the first to serve the breakfast items after noon and the expanded breakfast menu. It typically has the newest McD's food trends before some others.
The staff has always been friendly and helpful, too, taking care of those things needing to be handled right away, like the drink machine being out of a beverage or ice.
The place is clean & neat and, as important, the women's bathroom is well attended & kept up.< /Review>

<review>My grandson likes this place because of the very large play area. When there's no school, the place is pretty busy with 1st and 2nd graders, so you need to keep a watch out for their safety. But, when it rains--as it did recently--this is a place to let the kids blow off steam while you get a copy and use the free wifi.< /review>< Pics>

The one I went in only uses the order screen and not a cashier.  I'm not a huge fan of using a faceless screen I would rather speak to a human than order on a screen<//review>

<rating>3<//rating><Review>Stranded in drive thru for 10 min before ever getting to order. Could not leave to go elsewhere but called the number and after 2 tries and about 12+ rings later a young lady answers with a shaky voice.  Asked her why they were not moving the cars around to park while waiting for their food and she stated they are short handed.  They always seem to be short handed.  Additionally, after a 15 minute drive thru run, I find that my order was still missing items and the very elderly lady at the drive thru did not appear to understand English or respond when I spoke to her.  She just looked at me and rubbed her gums together then walked away.  The good thing is that the food was fresh.</Review>< pictures>

Service at drive thru was very slow. When I order something that will take time to make I am always told to go and park and wait, but when other people have complex orders in front of me they are allowed to just sit there holding up the line. Service is always slow after 9pm.</review>

His place had a long line with one cashier. The manager was yelling orders looking extremely disorganized. I was not given my receipt to know hen my order was done but that wouldn't have mattered as they didn't call it out, leaving it on the counter for me to find. There was also no dedicated handicap seating leaving me to climb up into one of there lifted tables. Not impressed with his establishment. Terrible Wi-Fi.< /Text>

We stopped here after doing a little hiking at Whiting Ranch Wilderness Park.  The restaurant was pretty clean and the food was just regular McDonald's food.

However, it took forever for them to fill my order.  I don't know what was happening that day, but there were not many customers in the restaurant when I placed my order and yet it still took 20 minutes for them to make a couple Sausage McMuffins with Egg and a McDouble.   In fact I saw my order in the tray waiting for one Sausage McMuffin for 15 minutes.  It took so long to get the second Sausage McMuffin, that when I finally got to sit down to eat the food, the first Sausage McMuffin that had been sitting on the tray was already cold.

If I knew I was going to have to wait that long for my food, I would have just gone to the nearest In-N-Out, where the burgers are actually worth waiting for.</review>

The manager is efficient and gets things done fast and accurately. I gave this place 3 stars because theres this lady that works drive thru every morning, nicest lady, but the coffee she makes is horrible, it always tastes bitter or too watered down. Even if its a cappucino or macchiato. Which sucks because its the closest one to me. Whenever a different person makes it, its always pretty tasty. Its just her coffee that tastes like that.<//review>

I went to Mc Donald’s to get 2 iced coffee and they charged me for 3 and I didn’t want the 3rd and the manager (Gladys) was so rude and when I was asking for my refund she was ignoring me and then arguing with me, I won’t go back.</text>

<review>Having other McDonald's closer to our home, we always choose to drive a little further if it means better service.  I have to say that this McDonald's location is the only place that I can say that time and time again we get our order just how we want it.  We love our Chicken  McNuggets cooked to order and we love that they do just that.  Other McDonald's  that we have visited seem to have a hard time pleasing their customers with their requests but not them and for that...we just want to say..."Than You!".</review><time>1621662091483<//time><UserId.>105732844673215648016<//UserId.><Response>None< /Response><Rating>5</Rating>< name>

Our carpets are almost 20 years old and we have pets. The young man that cleaned our carpets was very respectful and explained the services well. He did an excellent job cleaning our carpets and rugs. The pricing is very affordable and fair. Highly recommend this company!</review>

The tech that came out for my cleaning was very professional. He made it a point to inspect the carpet thoroughly and explain the services they offer clearly and help me pick what services were best for my space. Their costs were fair in respects to the job they did. He worked very efficiently and explained different parts of the process to me when he was doing them so I understood what he was doing. I had multiple spots of pet messes from an incontinent older dog and housebreaking a pup and they did a great job of removing them. I would definitely use them again and recommend them to friends & family.< /Review>

<Review>This is an amazing company that handled business properly. They are very nice, professional, courteous and they know what they are doing. We've used them many times and they are our first call. This last time they were booked up for a couple weeks and we needed the carpet cleaned to get the house on the market. We were going to have to wait but because the house was waiting to go to market on the carpet cleaning they kept us in mind when they had a cancellation and got is in 5 days early! The house went to market the next day because of this. We are so grateful and thankful to Chem-Dry for taking such good care of us! Top notch service and top notch people!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

My carpets were horrible. Eight people in the home, a puppy and two older dogs. Stains that were hard to remove . ChemDry removed 99.9%of them.  I will always use them.  Their price is outstanding for the quality of service you receive.<//review>

Rob did a great job cleaning our office carpets.  The carpets looked so much better plus he spayed a sanitizer on them.  I asked for a call about 30 minutes before arrival and he was right on time.  We will definitely use them again.<//Review>

I was using another company. I was not happy with the company I was using before because when they were done the room did not look or smell clean. I have 3 indoor dogs 🐶 so I have my one huge family room cleaned every 7 months.  I decided to try Chem Dry. I am so happy I did.  The service is superb. I love, love how they cleaned my carpet. Chem Dry is who I will be calling every 7 months. Great 👍🏻 job.< /Review>

I have went to west side Chem Dry from the beginning. Try a cheap outfit once about 5 yrs ago. Never again. Worth every penny and they are reasonable.
Happy Customer 12 years. First review!

<Review>The team was very professional. Before starting the job they wanted to know the cause of the fabric stain to ensure satisfaction once the job was complete and whether they could in fact guarantee removal of the stain. In fact they asked if they could do a test first and if it worked they would proceed with cleaning. Once the test was run we agreed to proceed. After the cleaning was done, from what we could tell the stain was gone. And since the fabric was dampened they even promised to come back if, once it dried, the stain returned. This is excellent service!< /Review>< Pics>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Very happy with the carpet cleaning I received several months ago.  It stayed nice for some months, as opposed to other carpet cleaning services I have received in the past. With kids and animals, it is always a struggle to keep things nice for any length of time, but their cleaning method really does the trick, and I felt the house was truly "sanitized" .  I will be contacting them again in the near future.  I only hope I get the same technician (he was awesome!!) I just can't recall his name, so I hope they keep good records.  A little pricier than perhaps other services, but well worth it.  Highly recommend!!!</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<review>Thank you John for doing a great job on our office carpeting. The carpet turned out great and you even gave us a bottle of spot remover on the house, wow, thank you !!  If you want your carpet to be professionally cleaned by a professional, then you have got to call John!  He makes cleaning carpets look easy, but we all know what a pain it is to try and clean a carpet ourselves...a huge headache...so call John today, you will be glad you did and so will your back!  Thanks again John !!<//review>< gmap_id>

Rob and the staff of Chemdry are very pleasant and work hard to get my daughters room clean. With a special needs child, we face unusual obstacles and these gentlemen are very professional and efficient. I Fully recommend Chemdry!<//review>

Chem Dry guys showed up when they said they would and were friendly and easy to deal with.  I had a 30+ year old oriental rug that had some damage. It looks marvelous now, better than I expected. They also to out a nasty spot on my living room carpet. I was very pleased and would use them again.</review>

Great job service was the best.                  Once you have your carpet clean by Chen-dry you will never go back to Steam clean.                Steam  clean is so out dated</review>

Chem- dry helped me out with some VERY bad cat urine damage to carpet.  Working with them was a breeze they are nice, helpful and understanding. They came in and did the first treatment and the smell was so much better, although not completely removed.  When I called to discuss this they didn't waste any time setting up another appointment to get someone out to me again.  The second time helped even more, although I have a nose like a hound and I can still pick up on the smell at times.  I believe in the product if you're working with minor to mediocre stains/smells.  For the real troubled areas (like mine) the product will make them 10 times better but not...perfect.</Text>

I ordered the large shawarma plate for takeout. The only thing large about this was the half empty aluminum container. It was $17 plus tip for what looks like someone else’s leftovers. The toddler-sized portion I was able to enjoy was good. But not $18 good. 😒< /review>

The falafel is quite good, if a bit salty, and the scharwma is edible.  Can't say the same for the hummus or  tabouleh. I make much better hummus and tabouleh than they do, and so can you. I really don't mind that the place is a hole in the wall and not that clean. I love Middle Eastern food, and this place is in my neighborhood. Nevertheless, I've more or less written it off and can't recommend it.< /Text>

This place is a solid 3.84 and the interior is decorated in a 'hole in the wall' facade.

Located on the south side of Irving St. between 22nd and 23rd Avenue, this is the definition of a no frills joint.  Service was quick.

We ordered a kufta kebob (lamb/beef) plate, chicken kabob plate and a greek salad with chicken.  My wife gave the salad a 3.7, I gave the kufta dish a solid 4 (we saved the last plate for later).  All in all a decent meal, felt clean after eating it (food was not greasy).  Would recommend, we'll be visiting again in the future.

Parking on Irving can be an issue, depending on the time of day.< /Text>

This place is always so crowded. Kind of a hole in a wall restaurant, mostly good for takeouts. The food is amazing, the falafel were so crunchy and all the flavors just hit the spot of what you expect a good falafel wrap should be. Would come back again!!</text>

A great meal at a good price in a spot that could use a bit of freshening up. Don't let that stop you from enjoying some great middle eastern food for both carnivores and vegans. Street parking is usually abundant within a block or so. Go, enjoy, and bring your family and friends.</Text>

<review>Dingy, dirty, greasy. I love Middle Eastern food, but this place was gross. The entire establishment is FILTHY. Greasy hand prints on the front door, table tops that are not wiped down, decrepit bathroom in the back. The food was bland and cheap (in quality, not price!) Everything about this place is old and sad. I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 because I was pleasantly surprised I didn’t get sick from the food.</review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

The shawarma (mixed chicken and lamb for me) and super falafel were very good. Worth trying if you're in the area with a taste for middle eastern cuisine.<//Review>

Best falafel in town.
Since five years I posted this remark, I want to add that since then, almost every two weeks, I buy two dozens of falafel, I eat couple while driving back home then keep the rest in the freezer in glass container.
When i like to have falafel for breakfast, I take few and put them in the toaster oven for 12 minutes at 375 degrees, they come out as if fried fresh.
Still the Great breakfast .....!< /Review>

The Falafel was crunchy and the wrap tasted good too. However, I thought the wrap was too dry and needed a hint of sweet. The place smells heavily of oil and it felt difficult to breathe.< /Review>

Sunrise Deli has delicious food. This was one of my 'go to' places for really tasty food. However they have gotten really stingy with the portions and raised the prices, $1 each for a falafel?!?!! Are you kidding me?! Just the other day ordered veggie combo plate, the plate was the size of regular bread and butter plate. The portions were very skimpy. Left here feeling like I had a snack instead of a meal. A real shame, this place used to be great.</Review>

Best falafel in San Francisco, I can't stop eating it. It's so yummy. Their other food is great too. I've had the falafel pita and some baklava. Definitely on my 'to-return' list of restaurants. And the owner is super nice.</text>

Unbelievably good falafel! Very inexpensive, quick, and convenient. It's probably my favorite place to eat in the Sunset District. A quaint, no frills restaurant with a little seating area if you don't want food on the go (though there's no way you could resist taking a dozen falafel with you to go!)</review>

<review>Place is in a need of a deep cleaning. This was by far the worst Chicken shawarma of the world. Cold chicken warmed up in a toaster oven. The Gyro machine has not been used in centuries.

The falafel here is really good if you can get them fresh and piping hot. They've got a crunchy crust, and the inside is soft and moist. The herbs and spices make them really flavorful, and they use enough sesame seeds to give it that toasty nuttiness. The taste is a good mix of saltiness, zest, and spice. For less than $6 for a dozen, I think they're priced pretty well too.< /review>

< Review>
I have been coming here for years. They still make the best falafel but its not as good as it use to be.

The hummus is too sour for my taste, maybe too much lemon?

I use to love the Koufte but the recipe changed too and is not add good.

So disappointed😕</Review>

< Review>
If you want food that is completely honest as to what it is, made by people that are who they are, this is the place.

It's not a "pretty" place, there is a minimal effort to manufacture ambiance since the "look" is not the concern at all.

The food is what they care about, and that is what they do, and do very well.<//Review>

Do not order delivery. Everything arrived cold. Dolmas where cold like they came out of a refrigerator and tasted sour. The lamb was super dry and the pita bread was covered in flour. I like Mediterranean food, but this food honestly stunk. The hummas was decent and my wife loved the cucumber salad, but everything else was par at best.< /review>

The best falafel in the city is their motto and it’s no joke. This place is a landmark in SF. All fresh ingredients made daily from scratch. A very homely local family owned and operated falafel deli with the comfort food to match. I am a vegetarian so I can not speak to the taste of the meats but I know that it is all Halal and sourced locally as are the rest of their ingredients. I’ve been living in SF since 1999 and have been going here the entire time, and it is always on point! Thank you Sunrise Deli for your years of excellence, hopefully there will be many more to come! 🌞</text>

It may not look like much from the outside, but you will not regret going here! The falafel was amazing, perhaps the best I've ever had. Other dishes that the rest of my family got were also very good. We got some baklava to go, and it was also excellent. Service was very friendly; they offered us whole falafel balls as samples. I will be back whenever I'm in that part of the city.<//text>

Easily one of the better middle eastern spots in SF.  I prefer Oasis, but this is still pretty good.</Review>

I would pass by this place every time I got a bite ot drink on Irving.  At first glance, this place looked a bit grungy and low-key.  I don't mind that, but when I ordered the small Shawarma Plate for $9, I did not expect it to be so small.  The hummus lacked flavor and the chicken was dry.  I have never been so disappointed by a restaurant before,  especially with so many good Asian options nearby for the similar or even lower prices.  I do not recommend this restaurant, though I hear the falafel is good here.<//review>

Great shawarma and friendly service! The place has a grungy-ish feel to it (for example the bathroom is directly through the kitchen and there's no sink in the room) but friendly service and quality food makes up for it - in a way, the feel of the place only adds to the charm.<//text>

I have been going here since 6th grade in 1989. There falafels are bright green inside and shaped like a convex disk instead of a regular ball or a pellet. The hummus babaganoush and cucumber tomato salad is also very good. It is more economical to buy these ingredients separately to make falafel sandwich at home. The flavor on the falafel itself is my favorite in the USA that I have tried, most flavorful bursting with garlic parsley and other house seasonings.< /Text>

<Review>Best falafel in town no lie and I'll tell you why. Crispy outside, moist and soft inside, pop of flavor from solid base and spices/herbs used, and fresh because they constantly make falafel. That is the star of this restaurant but for meat eaters  kibbeh and kufta are my go to. I recommend trying the dips and salads see if they adhere to your taste. Pretty standard recipes they do. A nice addition to make a nourishing meal. I like spicy food so I always like some home made shata, a middle eastern hot sauce. Finally, dessert can be classic baklava or their no added sugar date cookie! So good with a little less guilt. They also make s cookie or gharaba that delicately  melts in your mouth.</Review>< Time>

< review>
Reinforcing my belief that hole-in-the-wall delis are where you most often find the best surprises, Sunrise was fantastic. My family and I, all overly critical when it comes to food, ordered a small plate each - one chicken souvlaki, two lamb souvlaki, and a veggie platter. Though the chicken and the lamb were filling and good, the veggie platter was amazing.

The falafel was neither mushy nor hard, as it often is, but really crisp, moist and flavorful and described by someone in our party as "the best falafel I have ever had." All of us agreed and we ordered another half dozen pieces - happily downing them them with only a smear of their tasty hummus.

... and the dude working the counter was really great, suggesting that we try a little of this and that. We walked away with a powdery little rainbow of Turkish delight and an extra serving of falafel for later.

Go. Enjoy.< /review>

<review>Always so rude. I have been going since I was 19 and I regret it. I had a girl there put in wrong information about my driving experience and had my insurance go up. There is never a time where I don’t feel weird or unwelcome. The very last time I went, I had my boyfriend tell me that one of the girls there named Rocio was being very rude to him. When I got off the car I had experience the same thing. No customer service whatsoever.< /review></record>

<text>(Translated by Google) They do not have good customer service. The girl in there was very rude. they say it only cost 24 dollars a months, but they have hidden fees. Be captious.

They do not have a good service. The girl who works there is very respectful. When he asked me to print the fee, he told me in a bad way no. I do not recommend this insurance because it does not cost 24 dollars a month is much more. Do not spend your time there.

No tienen un buen servicio. La muchacha que trabaja allí es muy respetuosa. Cuando pregunte que me imprimiera la cuota me dijo de una mala manera no. No les recomiendo esta aseguranza por que no cuesta 24 dolares al mes es mucho mas. No gasten su tiempo allí.<//text>< pictures>

The room next to us someone was pounding on the door and yelling for about 1/2 hr. Tried to call the front desk but the phone didn't work.  Later around 3am a fight broke out.  Later that morning I complained to the manager about 45 min later I get a knock on my door and them wanting to know why I complained and  now they're getting kicked out. As of 3pm they have all there Belongings outside between my room and theirs just hanging out smoking. They mad dogged me when I went outside.  Did I mention the 8 plus cats that they had in The room that got out and they were trying to get them? Also the pillows were lumpy. Now that I think about it I'm changing my 3 to a 2 and that's being generous<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

And the jacuzzi wasn’t dirty and full of lint. Living room the couch has stains. Bedroom lights was different one was the LED light n the other light wasn’t and the curtain is broken.

Needs to be upgraded outside needs paint job. Room needs to be painted and wooden floors need to be replaced with new ones. TV and cable service need up grades. Along with micro waves and coffee pots old and outdated. The only thing I can say was outstanding was house service, everyday beds made and clean towels. I stayed for 6 nights and that’s about what my stay was like.<//review>

Positive: Location is ideal; only 10 minutes from where I needed to be. It's a quiet spot with basic rooms, which suited me just fine. If you're looking for upscale living with the rain showers and wireless charger alarm clocks, this isn't the place for you. Negative: The first night we were given a room that wasn't clean, but that night only needed it to store our belongings. Hardwood floors throughout, but some warped. Microwave and fridge old with pieces broken. Lobby closed from 10:30pm, no night assistance.< /text>

<text>Let’s see...First room we were given hadn’t been cleaned (see photos). Yikes!They kindly gave us another room which was okay. Had to ask for disposable cups and ice machine wasn’t working in our building. It’s an old building that’s been poorly renovated and furniture is piecemealed together. The good- the bed was comfortable and it was quiet.</text>< rate>

The room was excellent, very clean, but I was checked in till after 5pm, when I was supposed to be checked in at 2:30pm because no one was on site at that time. Their cable provider wasn’t working as well. It wasn’t getting a good signal on almost all the channels.</Review>

< Review>
I book & stay at a lot of hotels using the Star rating system on Google Maps...   There is no way this is a "3-Star Hotel"  compared to many of the places I have stayed at, it is a 2-Star Motel at best.  Something's Fishy.  Perhaps they have an insider at Google?< /Review>

The room had a bathroom door that didnt lock, the door was all crapped up, an ac that leaked with a towel under it to catch the water,  not enough towels for 2 people. The people at front desk were rude.<//Review>

<text>The room itself was clean. However the guest service is motel6 style service. 4 of 5 times I have tried to reach the front desk there is no answer. When I checked in I had to call the attendant's personal cell phone. she came rushing out of a guests room. Is she providing "additional services"? That is what the perception is. They charge an extra $50 in case you decide you like the towels and sheets more than your own at home. I was told this would be refunded when I checked out. Almost a week later it has not been refunded. With my rewards level I am able to have a late check out. When I asked how this worked the attendant responded in such a way that I felt like I was asking her to provide the same "additional services" the check in attendant was providing! I'm not that kind of guy nor do I care to associate with those kind of women. Let's upgrade the service level here! The Microtel in Morgan Hill and Super8 in downtown Las Vegas can give you some excellent points to follow!< /text></record>

For the price it's a pretty good hotel. We stayed here for a business trip and could walk to our destination. Decent breakfast too. It's not top of the line, but for the price, what you get is worth it</text>

I made a reservation through Wyndham rewards using my points and when i got there they said i have to pay instead (and will give you all kind of excuses), also they will try to charge a very high rate instead of the internet rate that you could have got before going there but since you are already there they just charge you whatever they want and since it was late i didn't have much options. The lady manager from India was also very rude and she thinks is very smart and better than you or at least that is how she made me feel, the opposite at how a hotel is suppose to treat customers.< /text>

The floors are really nice and the bathroom was very spacious. I’m very disappointed with the housekeeper who clean the room after I left. I forgot my ring and when I went back to get it they said it wasn’t there when I knew I left it there. Thieves. Definitely not coming back there. I don’t fee comfortable staying at a place where people aren’t honest< /text>

<user_name>Schae Coakley</user_name><rate>1<//rate><text>I stayed at this location for a work trip last week and the hotel was HORRIBLE. The room that I stayed in had bed bugs, I not only was bitten from the bed bugs, but I also had to throw away all of my belongings including my suitcase. When I brought the concern to the staff’s attention, I was immediately dismissed, spoken to poorly and was treated very poorly. I had to immediately check out of this place after making note of the bed bugs, and I wasn’t offered any special accommodation or even offered a simple apology. What was disappointing the most in this experience is the lack of quality service and customer care. I later called the hotel to speak to the manager because I was told he was out on business the week before, and before I could even explain my dissatisfaction I was met with yelling and screaming from the Manager and Owner. He was extremely disrespectful and rude, and passed the phone off to someone else who was unable to help. I was not expecting exceptional service from this establishment, but It was extremely disappointing and upsetting to be treated in this way given what I had to experience. If you ever stay here, please make sure you retain a record of the local Health Department’s number and formally proceed to file a complaint with the Health Department. Please protect yourself and follow best practices in dealing with this establishment.< /text>< Pics>

Clean. Decent sized rooms. Came for an event and met other people also attending. Small fitness room. Office answered any questions I needed and came promptly with towels, toilet paper, etc. Good location and good price if going to shoreline amphitheatre. Would definitely stay here again.< /review>

Decent, clean hotel, but a lot of needed maintenance to the building's exterior has been deferred for too long.I checked in late at night.  The clerk was friendly enough but seemed completely bamboozled by the computer and the phone system.<//review>

The front desk staff was super helpful when I had problems connecting to the wifi. It was clean, and everyone was friendly and helpful. A couple of not so good things-- when they cleaned my room, they didnt give me more coffee, so I had to make some effort to get more coffee for my room. And the other guests kids were out of control at the pool well after 11pm. They were making hella noise.<//Text>

<Text>Terrible Hotel Ever and without any doubt my worst experience! BED BUGs!!! This hotel is exposed drastically to the bed bug infestation! even if you stay a night, you'll see rashes and bites on your body. I've been in CA for a business trip and this issue becomes a great hassle for me. Now I need to dump everything I brought with me in the trip to avoid propagating it in my home. The management is awful, they lie on inspection! They try to give excuses as much as they can to avoid accepting any responsibility or refunding you! I called them, first they hang up after I explained the issue. I kept contacting and the response I got was that inspection has been done in the room and when I asked them about the exact time, they throw time and it turns out that I was in the room exactly at that time and no inspection has been obviously done during my stay! I strongly suggest not to even get close to this awful hotel!<//Text>< date>

Was looking for a simple inexpensive spot in this area.  All was fine until I spotted a bedbug in the morning.  That's a big red flag, but since everything else was fine I'll still give two stars.<//Review>

Low cost, no frills type of place. There's a large pool but it wasn't open when I was there. My room seemed to be newly renovated with new flooring and appliances. I didn't see any hot food options for breakfast, just the typical toast, fruit, juice setup that most budget hotels have. Lots of Asian restaurants in the vicinity.</Text>

<review>Standard 3 Star Hotel. Service was quick and easy. Room was clean and adequate. Not a lot of plug-ins for phones/laptops. You have a microwave in the room but good luck fitting food in the mini fridge. Internet speed is good enough to play games on, didn’t try and stream shows or movies. Half the tv channels didn’t work, continental breakfast was decent but could use some work. No meat (bacon, sausage, ham), only option for eggs was a cheese omelet. The area where you get breakfast is cramped.<//review><Rate>3<//Rate><Pics>None<//Pics>< Time>

<time>1522435991798</time><rate>3</rate><Review>The room itself was clean and comfortable and checking in/out was simple. I had a couple of issues with the room, which may or may not be just a preference issue. The first was the bed, it was too hard and uncomfortable for me and I had trouble sleeping. This also led me to focus on the weird tapping (or dripping??) noise coming from the wall/ceiling. The other issue was the water pressure. Washing my face in the sink was a challenge since there was hardly any pressure, and the shower wasn't any better. They did have a sign in the office about maintenance happening with the water lines, so hopefully it's not a constant issue.

That all being said... The breakfast was good and the staff was nice. If I could get a softer bed with them, I would definitely stay again.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Great place, pool was great. Came to Cali on a school field trip to have some fun. Stayed here and it was wonderful. Breakfast was wonderful. The room was nice, however not to many plugins for electronics. (Especially if you have a few people in the room) now remember that this is a motel so don't expect the best of the best. Can be a little noisy at times, but nothing to bad. Overall, great location, great amenities, great room.

It's pretty great! 😀</text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x808fb7afd9900935:0xf594ca88743e3d25< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The location was convenient.  The bed was comfortable. The room was spacious and clean.  Loved the wood floors.  Breakfast was average.  Room was next to fitness center so we were awakened every morning early by the treadmill runners making the floor shake.  The shower temperature was hard to regulate, either scalding hot or ice cold.</review>

The staff was very professional and helpful.  The morning breakfast and room were excellent.  The room, however, had a really strong smoke smell and had I not just come home from a concert and was too tired I would have asked for a different room because the smell was overwhelming.  I did inform the owner who said he would take care of the smell.  Not sure whether he had or not.</Text>

Main issue I faced was bedbugs there.. you cannot switch off the lights and sleep, else you will be deficit with blood the next morning 😀😀

I booked this hotel because it was near yo Google, Microsoft and Amazon.

One or two days stay is okay but can't stay more that that...

Yes, you can get car parking, morning breakfast Free.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Extremely horrible customer service. Violated our privacy and right to use our do not disturb sign. Bathroom window literally falling out off the track onto me cutting my leg. The manager refused to help, discount or refund us. He refused to even talk to us about the situations. We caught some guy in our room when we got back to the hotel, after we put the do not disturb sign up. The front desk lady told the maintenance guy that he can knock 3 times and if no one answers then just walk in to fix the window and toilet. We disputed it and they refused to even talk to us. They told us to call the police and make a report. We took it up with the corporate and they were not of any help. This perused for 4 months. This hotel was disgusting, the food was absolutely horrible, and the staff had horrible customer service. Would not recommend this hotel to anyone. It’s not safe nor secure for kids or people to stay at. They go through you stuff when your not there. Even though they violated the security policy, there was no consequences. They should be held responsible. And we tried with everything we could to make that happen. Wish I could give them zero stars.<//Text>

Ask for extra pillows before then if you need them as there is no housekeeping staff to bring those by late at night.

The water faucet for the shower / bath in our room was upside down, and started scalding hot moving towards cold as you turned it on.

Other than that, it was a hotel with a firm bed and good air conditioning. We slept well and it's right off the freeway (though getting there from 101N is a bit of a janky lane change to get to the street).<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

Location for me is about the best thing about this place. The showers fluctuate in temperature to the point it's unbearable. The middle aged lady at the front desk was combative when I wanted to change rooms because of the shower. The fridge made a terrible noise that kept me awake. The free breakfast does have egg omelets, but their frozen and there's a line for the microwave to warm them up. 1/10 will not stay again.< /Text>

<review>Sundowner Inn or as it is now called, Days Inn by Wyndham, is a centrally located Inn right off Hwy 237 in Sunnyvale. Due to it's prime lication, commuters have quick access (by car) to all of Silicon Valley. The rooms are spacious and spotless, and have been recently renovated. I found my stay very comfortable. There are also wheelchair accessible rooms with great care taken to ensure full amenities and easy accessibility features (room 107 is a great example). Mr. Shah, the owner, continues to help his staff regularly, with the vigor and vim of a person a quarter of his age , even sometimes working the front desk on weekends, where he loves to meet his guests and give them an overview of the grounds, of which he takes great pride. There is a lovely pool on-site and breakfast is served daily at the pool cabana. There is also a Greek restaurant with tasty choices for everyone. My week-long stay was excellent, and I would highly recommend it if visiting the Sunnyvale, San Jose, or surroundings.</review><Rating>4<//Rating>< GmapID>

For the price this is exactly as advertised.  The only downside is the appliances are a little old and there was no vent in my bathroom.  (I think) as a result of no vent being in the bathroom the cleaning service opened the bathroom window every day to air out the cleaner fumes.  I compulsively had to close it every night, since I don't like sleeping with windows open.</review>

Basic good housekeeping missed a few details:
1) pack-n-play "crib" needs the padded piece (was replaced by a single queen flat sheet -- ouch ouch!). Front office staff took me to look for it -- found :-)
2) clean the crib!! Cockroach living in the folds!! Smashed, then checked for others.

Otherwise, 1st floor accessibility room w/ (2) queens is fairly newly renovated w/o carpet (yay!) and nice lighting.

Front office staff are nice people and executed quick check-in.<//review>

Waited 40 minutes to check In. Could not connect to WiFi. Front desk lady argued with me about It and said all of their computers were working fine ! Said MY COMPUTER was the problem. WRONG ! Manager gave me a customer service number and was able to connect to WiFi by bypassing their DNS server. Very noisy last night. People partying on 2nd floor. Not good !<//text>

Large rooms with hardwood floors. All of the amenities. Dark room. Decent breakfast, they serve pre-made omelets. They have a pool and a gym but I didn't have the time to experience either of them.< /Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>Horrible experience at this motel.  The room was dirty and smelly. Had to wait 2 hrs to check in because there were no rooms ready when we arrived.  Horrible, horrible customer service.  He had a bad attitude when he checked us in.  We asked for a rollerbed and they delivered it to the room, when we opened it, there were rat poop on the bed sheet. It was so GROSS!!! We quickly folded it back up and rolled it out of our room.  Then I called the front desk and told them about it, but they didn't say nothing, not even a "we're so sorry".  We were suppose to stay there 2 nights but I couldn't sleep that night because this whole ordeal made me uncomfortable.  So we checked out very early the next morning.  I wish I would've taken a picture of the rat poop and report this slum motel to the health department.  I will never, ever stay at another Days Inn ever again!!!  Don't even let the pictures of this motel online fool you.</review>< pics>

Nice and cozy little hall too bad the space was kind of small for the event we got to attend there and the fact that there's only 1 restroom (stall) for women line  to pee was awful with only 1 stall that's why I'm giving it a 3 stars other than that it was ok< /review>

<Review>Room was great for the price. Bed was comfortable. It was a bit noisy, but only briefly. Breakfast lacked meat and variery... tons of sweets and carbs if you're into that.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Clean and rather spacious room. Don't expect much here but staff are friendly. The breakfast Is exceptionly Good for the price included in the room charge. The downside is it's very expensive if there's a conference in the area.<//text>

The wood floor was separated big gaps near the bathroom. When we showered, the entire floor ended up soaking wet as if we had spilt half the shower water outside the tub making it dangerously slippery, we had to use the towels to soak up the water on the floor. Over all it was not what was advertised.The breakfast was mediocre at best.<//text>

I was very satisfied with the hotel. Because It has good rocation and reasonable price for the service. I know if you are not satisfying the hotel. You should prepare more money to stay in Sunnyvale, CA.
Thanx ! Days inn & suites, See you later !</Review>

<rating>1</rating><Text>I ended up spending the nights of Monday - Thursday at the Days Inn in Sunnyvale.  It was the only thing that was close, still available, and under the hotel cap for my company, so I went for it.  I didn't realize it was a motel (strike 1), I didn't realize it was itty-bitty (strike 2), or that it didn't have wifi (strike 3), so I wasn't terribly happy on first arrival.  That night, I was made less happy by being woken up twice by loud rodent sounds coming from roughly under my bed.  Gross, but fine, I thought, I'll just make sure I eat all my meals out, not leave food anywhere, and not spend much time here until tomorrow night, when I can get my money back.

Except they wouldn't let me leave.  They told me first that I couldn't get a refund for the first night, which I thought was lousy but reasonable.  I had paid them for a night in a room, I guess I didn't specify it needed to be rat-free.  Then they told me that I couldn't get my money back for that night, or any of the other nights I was staying there.  "You can leave any time you like, but you can never check out," I guess.  I was pretty resigned at this point, so I asked if they could at least get me some traps I can set so I can sleep.  They said, and I quote this because it is so memorable, "We had the guy buy extra traps this week, but it looks like we're out."  Every part of that sentence is just wrong.  You cannot run a motel under these circumstances.  But no, resigned Nathan just asks if they can direct me to a hardware store so I can buy my own traps.  I figure I'll expense them!  I get the name of one down the street and she prints out Google Maps directions for me.  I follow the Google Maps directions, arrive at the hardware store: it's closed.

So I gave up and coped with it.  The second night I was there I finally got a glimpse of one of these. It was about the size of a soda can and was running from behind my nightstand to behind my bed.  Ugh.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<review>OK place to stay.
Free breakfast in the morning, descent breakfast, the breakfast area is next to the pool and is quite nice. The staff quite rudely kicked everyone out of the breakfast area ten minutes before the time was up saying they had to clean the place.

<Review>This seems like a good deal for the price compared to other Santa Clara hotels and motels. The check-in experience could have been better, I think the 'new guy' checked me in.  Another guy reminded him to speak politely.  The room was nice and seems clean.  The furniture and flooring were in good shape.

Most of the pillows were too big and fluffy for me. Not as much as I have seen at other places though.  It's a good reminder to bring your own.

I did not test the wi-fi, check out the pool or try the coffee.

The towels were as you find most anywhere - white, scratchy and too small.

Parking seems adequate.

I would return here.

Update: I forgot to mention that to charge your phone on the nightstand you need to pull the furniture away from the wall to get to a plug.  The top plug was so loose my charger prongs wouldn't stay in the socket!< /Review><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x808fb7afd9900935:0xf594ca88743e3d25</gmapID><rating>4< /rating><Time>1469601047966< /Time><user>105697756690872940261< /user><pictures>None<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Out-dated and dirty. We watched about 5 different men visit the prostitutes in the room next to us within an hour span. They harassed us about my service dog (made copies of her registration, which is actually illegal). Then put a pending charge of $150 on our card before we even checked out. They told us it would be refunded when my husband went in and talked to them then ended up clearing a $200 charge. When I called regarding that charge they told us it would be refunded and that it takes time to go back into our account. Just spoke with then again a week later and they said there is a note to speak with the manager when he gets in. This place is disgusting and will try to scam every penny out of you.< /Review>

<text>We have booked so many rooms through orbitz. The room in this hotel was infested with bed bugs. As the booking was done through orbitz we were told that the room was prepaid and hence we had to send an email to the manager to discuss the situation. The manager never responded to the mails. Its sad that Orbitz lists hotels such as this that have poor customer service and super bad rooms.</text><Name>Orbitz reviewer<//Name>< time>

<Review>Maintenance came to check the thermostat because there was no power to it, but he knocked, and didn't give us time to get to the door, before he used his key to barge into our room. We had traveled 15 hours the day before, so we were tired. The key chain was in, so he wasn't able to come in the room. We got dressed, telling him "just one minute", and by the time we opened the front door, he was gone. I called the front desk, and they said he had already gone (left the property, seriously, after 2 minutes?) The only thing more frustrating than someone barging into your room is that they aren't even there once you get to the door.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< time>

<text>Stayed there first time 7/29/16 for a concert, evidently used to be a Sundowner motel but new owners.
Checked in they were nice enough, but they want $100 deposit, for credit cards (??) and make sure you DON'T BRING A DOG they aren't allowed (don't know why, the place is nothing special).
The room was ok, hardwood floors, refrigerator, microwave.
Breakfast was ok, nothing special.
Oh, make sure you get to the breakfast because there's NOTHING else around.
It is convenient for 237 or 101.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<user_name>Emilie Holzer< /user_name><review>We reserved a two room suite weeks in advance of our house being tented. When I went to check-in with my two small children they informed me that they had overbooked, so they would be putting us in a single room with two beds. They were unapologetic and did not seem to see anything wrong with the situation. They also did not offer any discounts to make up for our dissappointment. Since we were essentially living our regular life (husband still going to work, kid still going to preschool, etc), it was very important to be getting naps and regular sleep (not vacation sleep). Needless to say, we did not stay there and were quite angry about the whole situation. I would suggest calling ahead of time to make sure that you are actually getting what you reserved.< /review>< Resp>

< review>
I'm sitting in the room right now, debating if I can make it through the night hiding on top of this bed or if I need to go find another room or even sleep in the car. This is by far the worst hotel I've ever been in.
The front desk lady must have been depressed. Checked my friend into my room and me into his and told us to just not cause any issues in the rooms.
In the room, the lights all have sensors on the switches so the lights keep randomly turning on and off. There are cobwebs in the corners, black stains on the walls and the floor boards in the bathroom have all been torn out (probably due to the water damage under the sink).
The sheets and blankets look clean, but of course I'm too freaked out to look at the mattress under them. So I'm going to sleep on top of the blanket and use the blanket from the other bed next to me to keep me warm (this is again assuming I don't hear bugs crawling and abandon everything and sleep in the car).
So much for Days Inn having any semblance of a reliable brand. Avoid this place like it's the plague.< /review>

<review>Horrible guest service. I have never seen a hotel worse than this.
I had got a room for my old parent who had come to visit me for the weekend.
They noticed that the water is not coming in the wash basin when I droped them to sleep at 10:00 pm. I brought it to the notice of the front desk person. But she said that she cannot do anything for that.
I asked her to change the room but she even refused to do that saying its so late at night!!!!
Basically I think they run the hotel with just one person after 4 pm, thats fine to reduce the costs but they should have somrone for an emerging problem on call which they dont have or they dont bother to trouble them
The customer service means none for them.< /review>< Rating>

This is a motel in the true sense of the word. No luxury.  But my room was clean and the location is very central.  But — this is just an old motel.  If all you need is a clean place to sleep for a few hours then this does the job.</Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The attendant treated me with total indifference. I arrived at the hotel after 20 hours of travel and needed to take a shower to go to the congress. She simply told me that the room was not clean and went back to talking on the phone. Since my reservation began the day before.
Except that the PDP left 50 dollars stuck in the card as voucher. I asked and she said she had released the value.
Today, a month after my stay the value remains stuck as voucher on the card. I can not move at all.

A atendente me tratou com total indiferença. Cheguei no hotel depois de 20 horas de viagem e precisava tomar um banho pra ir ao congresso. Ela simplesmente me disse que o quarto não estava limpo e voltou a falar no telefone. Sendo que minha reserva começava no dia anterior.
Fora que a fdp deixou 50 dolares preso no cartão como voucher. Eu perguntei e ela disse que tinha liberado o valor.
Hoje, um mês depois da minha estadia o valor continua preso como voucher no cartão. Não posso movimentar pra nada.</Text>< gmap_id>

<Text>(Translated by Google) It's creepy, it's ugly, it's cold, it's lost, it's not very clean, it really makes you want to run. But when the booking is booked, you have to sleep there. But I really do not recommend this place. It is particularly difficult to find a nice hotel in the area, but this one is really to be avoided.

(Original)
C'est glauque, c'est moche, c'est froid, c'est perdu, c'est pas très propre, ça donne vraiment envie de partir en courant. Mais quand la réservation est bookée, il faut bien y dormir.

<Text>(Translated by Google) The location is close to the entrance of the freeway in Silicon Valley, and it is convenient to visit the vicinity of Silicon Valley. I think that the room is also large and has a refrigerator and is good. The drawback is that housekeeping was late or came too early.

As of writing this is a self Ref location which is kinda refreshing as long as you come out with some friends and have lots of paint you'll have a good time. People will ask to join your games if you're friendly enough. Fields are maintained very well</Text>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>This Establishment was very unprofessional, unregulated, and overall a waste of time and money. We came here three times and every time was an awful experience, we hoped that it'll better the next time but we were unfortunately wrong. The owner is very rude and shows favoritism towards strangers who have money. One personal experience we have had with him was when he has told one my friends (more like calling him out in front of everyone) telling him to put a barrel bag over his gun. He then followed him to the air refill station and accused him of not paying when in fact we already paid. As time goes by our ref has left our group and joined a party in which all the player's barrel covers were off and they were actually shooting outside of the field. There's signs written basically everywhere saying to have covers on the guns.  the ref was even shooting with them. This ref we speak of thought it was funny to scare our friend (the same one accused of not paying) and shot at him with an empty gun but still filled with air at his private parts at point blank range. The staff there are honestly immature, disrespectful and just plain rude like the owner. The fees there are honestly burglary. They have a five dollar outside paintball fee (which does make sense) but they don't even check your paint. I am self equipped but I still have to spend up to 80 dollars!! This is my last time coming and now I'll  going and spending my money on the way better fields. I didn't feel safe around these "grown adults" playing and swinging around there uncovered and loaded guns around me and my friends and family.</review>< pics>

I was excited to play paintball. Had invited a group of new friends who were going to experience playing paintball for the first time.

I had called them to see if they were open. They said, yes. They neglected to inform us that their air compressor was out of service.

Arrived to USPN, got dressed up, and try to pay for the due fees. Employee said, air compressor wasn't working and they were trying to fix it. They didn't know how long it was going to take.

We were all dissatisfied and disappointed. Our new friends whom I was introducing to paintball had a very negative experience. It is ridiculous how they lured us into their field hoping that they would have had their air compressor fixed by the time we arrived.</text>

I was excited to play paintball. Had invited a group of new friends who were going to experience playing paintball for the first time.

I had called them to see if they were open. They said, yes. They neglected to inform us that their air compressor was out of service.

Arrived to USPN, got dressed up, and try to pay for the due fees. Employee said, air compressor wasn't working and they were trying to fix it. They didn't know how long it was going to take.

We were all dissatisfied and disappointed. Our new friends whom I was introducing to paintball had a very negative experience. It is ridiculous how they lured us into their field hoping that they would have had their air compressor fixed by the time we arrived.</Review>

They provide water and other beverages for FREE!!! That's great and especially appreciated on hot So Cal days!! I especially appreciated the service provided and if you want to make sure your vehicle is returned, when they say it will be, ask for Olive. She is the best service coordinator ever!!!!! She is pleasant, thorough and professional.  You can tell that she loves helping people!! Thank you Olive for always  making service at Claremont Toyota a nice experience!! 🤗🤗 You rock!!!!!!< /text>< pics>

Juanita runs the Service Department  & ALWAYS makes sure I feel @ home.... Most of the staff / technicians are bilingual and alway have the best manners. Ask 4 Alex for if u're interested in purchasing, or Juanita if u need maintenance service 😁. I arrived JUST as they were closing & they still took me in. Love u guys!!

<review>Tony Sanchez took his time to hear out my concerns, even though I was initially very pushy due to having been told by Crown Toyota I couldn't be helped.

Claremont Toyota really surpassed my expectations as they took my concerns seriously, giving me the benefit of the doubt  and exhausting all options, including a test drive with me personally.

Even though we could not replicate my problem at the dealership, Troy Ono reassured me he believes my problem to be legitimate, and offered to handle any follow-up I may need personally.

After such a negative experience with Crown, I truly appreciate the time and personal understanding Tony and Troy provided.</review></record>

<Text>When I was leaving CA to go back home, my car (Prius) had broken down. I was luckily able to (carefully) drive it to Claremont Toyota's Service Center where Mr. Bernal helped me and my wife get our car up and running (problem was due to a failing water inverter pump).

After a disastrous birthday for my wife and all that transpired in the earlier part of our week, I'm fortunate that the legendary service and help from Toyota's Service Center still holds up strong. Thank you for all you do.<//Text><username>Grant< /username><GmapID>0x80c331f0646e0cd5:0x304d4446db960c6f<//GmapID>< Pictures>

<text>Received honest and fair service assistance from Claremont Toyota customer service representative.  Have had older Toyota vehicle serviced several times at this dealership. So far the customer service has been. exceptional. Actual repair service has also been good. Cost of parts and labor can always be lower. But, reliability and customer service brings me back.<//text><Rating>4< /Rating><Time>1572973058834<//Time><name>Fishman Fishman<//name><Pics>None< /Pics>< user_id>

An unfamiliar, small blinking red light on my dashboard prompted a late run to the shop. A service tech looked in and assured me it was a reminder to not lock my key in the car. (He was kind to not say, "Duh, Boomer"). I'm new to the area, will return when service is needed.</Text>

(Translated by Google) I do not go back to that Toyota, which treated me with a very despota attitude, what a shame because the truth is the diller that most sercas I have left of my house, but I prefer to handle dealing with personnel like that.

No vuelvo a ir a ese Toyota el que me atendió una actitud muy despota, que pena porque la verdad es el diller que más sercas me queda de mi casa, pero prefiero manejar a tratar con personal así.< /review>

<Review>Fresh, Delicious food. Friendly attentive service. Masks required & temperature check at the door. It was my first visit to a Korean barbeque restaurant and they kindly explained how it all worked. There is a menu for the hot pot and one for the barbecue, and we had both. I would be hard pressed to identify a favorite dish here. I enjoyed everything that I tried: short ribs, sausage,  fish balls, lobster balls, spicy calamari, spicy octopus, I don't remember all of it. Anyway, it's a very good restaurant as well as an experience. I highly recommend it.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Review>Goku never disappoints. Their AYCE Korean BBQ has a short list of items that are excellent quality and well marinated. Most places in the bay are way overrated but this is an actual hidden gem. I’ll always be coming back!!< /Review>< pics>

< Review>
COVID-19 experience: our first visit here. Amazing food, great variety, fresh meat (besides lamb it was definitely old). We were so excited for an indoor experience (since end of March). It was Saturday night and even though the servers were super busy they were still very attentive and took care of us.
Not to mention the bang for the buck, super affordable.
Absolutely coming back soon!!! Delicious!
My personal favorite is the beef brisket and both types of beef short ribs.
Thank you to the amazing team!<//Review>

I have come to this place many times and i still love it!  too many choices and such fun to cook…… My best recommendation would be beef bulgogi, peime steak, signiture galbi, garlic shrimp, and baby octopus. if you wrap them in lettuce, it would take away some salty taste and give it a bit of freshness. And don't forget to goto the sources bar to get all kinds of spice. Yummy yummy< /Text>

< Review>
Best value for money. Unli Food and rice and refillable drinks with no additional charge. I suggest start with beef since it cooks faster than other meat. The first time we went there, we order hotpot and it made us full faster so the second time we didn't order one. Service is always great.<//Review>

If you're looking for a solid KBBQ & Hot pot place at a good price then look no further. Now is this place the most authentic KBBQ& Hot pot of all time ? No. Aside from that I look for a nice meal and a good time which is what this place provides every time I've visited. I love coming here during lunch time due to it being not as busy, a cheaper price and you get your food/meats way quicker. Having a good amount of selection of assortments of meats, veggies and seafood giving it a plethora of combinations given for your meal. Pre covid they have a salad/fruit/sauce bar which unfortunately until restrictions are lifted once more you will not have access to. Staff is friendly and are quick on their feet to make sure your needs are met and ticket times from the moment ordered are fairly quick given the time of day (lunch/dinner). They are currently doing indoor and outdoor dining with a tent with plenty of seating outside. Only thing I would really say about this restaurant is that depending on time of day expect to have a decent wait time anywhere from 30-45 mins. Also, pre covid the restaurant was prone to getting very smokey indoors due to patrons cranking up their grills (I'm guilty) but they are currently leaving their front doors open which seems to help a lot. Solid food, good atmosphere and just a good time.<//text>

Food was great and tasty. The manager was very nice  but the only thing I didn't think was acceptable was the fact that we were pushed to order our last call and then when I ordered a 2nd beer 25 min went by so I asked a random waiter (not ours) for my 2nd beer he got it immediately. But then my waiter returned 15 min later with my 2nd beer but I told him I already got it but he sat the beer on my.table anyways and said "here" then charged me for the 3rd beer.</Text>

New Korean BBQ place on Meridian Ave. Had a great experience on my first visit. Pretty good quality of meat and wide variety of selection. Service was beyond my expectation. Place is very clean. Really had a good time eating here. Highly recommend this place for BBQ lovers.<//review>

But If you want to come on your own, don’t, they will completely ignore you. The servers literally gave the least service just because I was there on my own. It actually felt like they didn’t want to waste their time on me because the tip wasn’t going to be as much.
It took at least 20/25ish minutes to get a server to my table. I spent at least 2 and a half hours here and most of that time was spent waiting for a server to help me.
And that’s not just cause I wanted more food. Cause I actually got very little before getting fed up and leaving.
At one point while I was cooking my burner ran out of propane, I waited patiently while looking at servers and trying to flag them down... But literally every time, they looked right at me then quickly looked away and went to other tables. I watched servers visit other tables multiple times in a row, when they knew I was sitting there waiting to be helped.
They’re okay when you have more people with you, but after that experience Im never going back again, even with people.</Review>< Pics>

<review>First time eating @ Goku and it was a great experience! Gabriella was so helpful and friendly! She assisted us by setting us up and explaining the process of ordering with her awesome suggestions!

We ate here on a Sunday so all day is @ a dinner rate which is $27.99 per person. The food was fresh and with our choices of dipping sauces it was so delicious! BTW, the floors can be slippery because of the aerosol of fat being cooked  so be careful. We'll definitely be returning any day besides on a Sunday.< /review><Time>1570715800633</Time>< gmap_id>

Yelp wait list to speed things up. We got in and went right for it. The meat selections were better or on par with other kbbq. Lichi and pineapple in their sauce bar made this a clear win for me. One of the few places with roe fish balls too.< /review>

< Review>
I’ve been to a bunch of Korean BBQ places and the environment in Goku was definitely the best. It had a modern feel, music that was playing was great, and staff was awesome too. There’s a self serve bar to make yourself your own signature sauce, and the food taste great as long as you cook it properly. Wait was a little long on a Saturday night(hour wait), but that’s expected.< /Review>

Best value for money. Unli Food and rice and refillable drinks with no additional charge. I suggest start with beef since it cooks faster than other meat. The first time we went there, we order hotpot and it made us full faster so the second time we didn't order one. Service is always great.</Text>

Loved this place! Found it because I needed a place close by, after a doctor's appointment. Try to go right before lunch ends at 3. There will be fewer people and the service is excellent.

Also, you can try both the bbq and hot pot for $20.99(before tax) during lunch. I'm so full.

Can't wait to go back!<//Text>

I love this place. The meat, seafood, veggies, and fruits are fresh and the variety of condiments and variety of sauce are delicious. I love the miso soup i choose. There are varieties of flavor to choose. The servers, host were friendly and explain to us how to get started since it was our first time. Had excellent service from Alvin. Thank you for making our first time experience great. We will definitely come back.😍👌< /text>

A good option for AYCE Korean BBQ during Covid. Tables are outdoors and spaced out. Add $3 for hot pot. Good selection and tasty. Cons due to covid: side dishes are really small portions in single serve plastic cups and bottled or can drinks only.

Awesome meal!</text>

This place is my go-to hotpot place now. It's AYCE hotpot and you can add on kbbq for a few more bucks if you wanted. They have many delicious soup bases and good selection on their menu as far as proteins and veggies. Their sauce bar has everything you want and includes a mini desert bar. The servers are attentive and brings what you order in a timely manner. A tip for vegetarians, I don't remember if they have vegetarian broths but if not, just ask for hot water with ginger because you can add all the flavors to it with the sauce bar! The lunch is a great deal too if you can make it over there. So yummy, I wanna go back already!<//text>

Perhaps we came on a bad day, but we were very disappointed. We ordered a few types of meats, and they were either bland or overly marinated. Some items tasted like they were about to expire. The bonchon were pretty bad which surprises me because a lot of places just take them out of a jar. The only good item was the galbi. The popcorn chicken tasted like it was fried in the morning and left outside for the rest of the day. Jab chae was undercooked. The “hot pot” should be called noodle soup, and it was pretty bad noodle soup. Noodles in it were soggy, and the Taiwanese soup is definitely not Taiwanese—way too spicy and not the right flavor. Also, they charge for water.<//Text>

This was not authentic korean food. It's a gimmick. Over priced meat, dry rice, limited menu... Watered down marinades and nasty customer service. Don't waste your money on this poor quality establishment.<//text>

<Text>Went for soft opening, 16.99$ and $3 for add on (for both soup and k bbq). Very much like q pot; has a sauce bar and same concept. Except doesn’t have the cool machines like q pot where you can order thru. However, they do have a sheet you can mark what you want and staff comes and get it.

*I was very impressed w the quality of the fruits (watermelon and lychee) by the sauce bar; they were ripe, sweet and delicious!

*loved their Tom yum soup, broth was killer!!!

*brisket and bolgogi was very delicious; loved their Kim chi and all the sides!

*staff was attentive and on it!

Loved how spacious it is and parking lot is huge! Definitely worth a try!< /Text><date>1534615056649</date>< Rate>

<time>1543523663009<//time><Rating>5< /Rating><text>Another AYCE Korean BBQ spot that has satisfied my KBBQ needs. I love the decor and spacious tables, which is ideal when you have meats piling on top of each other. The place looks almost identical to Q-pot in San Jose. I think they have the same owners but I gotta say there are some very special differences. Goku and Q-pot serves both KBBQ and hot pot and they are in all ways very similar. Only difference is that Goku does not have a touchscreen menu and lack Napa cabbage and egg noodles for thier hotpot. Abothrr difference is that they have the Goku house soup base (a tonkatsu soup)which was delicious. The meat quality is great and thier kalbi is marinated well. My wife liked that they serve oysters, but I caution you that they take a while to cook. Oysters we're large and plump and you need to strategically place them on the grill so they don't take too much space. We stayed almost 2 he's eating there and a good portion was to cook the oysters. But over all 5/5 for this place! We will be back this weekend.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCRotxy2Af2b5DK_P-SE4XwPxTYb2YOTCMOxF2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOiDg1luYxdULqEgvpu9wo9HnAoL0Pg7t7u__Mz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEyNvnKksHqp-eUQDi5lceR-uGTGEfq6g139d1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNln1LEGAr3ubifduNxau8psBavPt-A1usrudC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbGNzqOg2XZeqqRieZrbvsqPjnLWUCcFK6c43x=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x808e347982dbb2bb:0xfe26c00b7a07f4d7< /Gmap_id></record>

<review>I have come to this place many times and i still love it!  too many choices and such fun to cook…… My best recommendation would be beef bulgogi, peime steak, signiture galbi, garlic shrimp, and baby octopus. if you wrap them in lettuce, it would take away some salty taste and give it a bit of freshness. And don't forget to goto the sources bar to get all kinds of spice. Yummy yummy< /review>< Pics>

Waited quite a while but that was expected since we came at dinner time and it was extremely busy. I recommend calling in ahead of time to put your name on the list. They were very polite even though they were very busy. The service was great even on a busy day.< /text>

<review>Almost the same thing as q pot except for their canned fruits they try to serve. If you like q pot u might like this place. They have both hotpot and kbbq, $3 more to have both. The Taiwanese spicy broth version was way too oily though, my veggies were just soaked in oil<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Name>Connie Luo</Name>< Response>

< Review>
Perhaps we came on a bad day, but we were very disappointed. We ordered a few types of meats, and they were either bland or overly marinated. Some items tasted like they were about to expire. The bonchon were pretty bad which surprises me because a lot of places just take them out of a jar. The only good item was the galbi. The popcorn chicken tasted like it was fried in the morning and left outside for the rest of the day. Jab chae was undercooked. The “hot pot” should be called noodle soup, and it was pretty bad noodle soup. Noodles in it were soggy, and the Taiwanese soup is definitely not Taiwanese—way too spicy and not the right flavor. Also, they charge for water.</Review>

Almost the same thing as q pot except for their canned fruits they try to serve. If you like q pot u might like this place. They have both hotpot and kbbq, $3 more to have both. The Taiwanese spicy broth version was way too oily though, my veggies were just soaked in oil< /text>

Waited quite a while but that was expected since we came at dinner time and it was extremely busy. I recommend calling in ahead of time to put your name on the list. They were very polite even though they were very busy. The service was great even on a busy day.<//text>

Very good place! If you love Korean BBQ and Chinese hot pot, this is the place! All you can eat for about 30 bucks. 3 more dollars more per person, and you can do both! Chinese hot pot + Korean BBQ is a fantastic idea, and this spot marinades very well!<//review>

<text>Seriously love this place!!! I just moved to the area a few months ago and have been here more than 5 times. 31 bucks a person for both options on the weekends or 21 bucks a person for both options for lunch or the weekdays. Killer deal.

I totally recommend it. This place has the cuisine and the service down to a finely engineered process. Our waitress was visibily slammed but still managed to be very attentive and solicit needs without having to be asked. Couldn't speak any more highly of the service experience. I'll totally come back.</Text>

I came here for an all you can eat kbbq dinner, which is about 30 before tip and tax. The wait staff was very attentive to my table and was changing out the grill pretty frequently. Over the course of an hour and a half, our grill was swapped about 5 times to keep our food tasting clean. They don't have a huge variety of meats like some other places, but they do have an incredibly solid menu that they do well. The meats were well marinaded, tender, and juicy. The steaks were trimmed superbly, so there was never a mouthful of gristle. This place is a bit pricier than other similar restaurants, but as far as quality is concerned, it's well worth the price.<//Text>

We randomly found this place while exploring the South Bay.  We were blown away by the amazing service and delicious food.  The food did not disappoint.  We're from LA and Korean food options are unlimited.  This is one of the best we've found in the bay area.  The servers are super attentive.  We'll definitely be back...soon...all...the... time.< /Text>

The food is great. The service is great, everyone welcomes to customers ( especially manager Yena was amazing and gives best service ) Tables are spacious and had enough room. The meat and salads are fresh. Big salad bar, everyone is smiling. It is the best kind of environment to be in.</Text>

<Text>It's best if you come during lunchtime and order both the hot pot and the BBQ. You won't have access to like...3 or 4 of the dinner meats but you still get so much food for way cheaper. The food is fabulous and you definitely leave full, but it's the experience you want. The service is great too.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< time>

<Review>Goku offers great value for an all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ place. For 30 bucks per person(weekend rate, cheaper in the weekdays) you get to try a variety of different meats and seafood. A lot of the meat and seafood is frozen and thawed, and some beef items are fresh, but the quality is still pretty good. Some of their side dishes are really horrible renditions of typical Korean dishes like the tteokbokki and japchae, so stay away from those. The service is top notch, the waiters are always hovering around asking if you need anything.<//Review>< resp>

I don't have a lot of experience with Korean Barbecue restaurants, so I can't compare this to other places, but honestly there is no need for any other places. The food and value and service is absolutely stellar, and this place should have a long wait at all hours of the day, but it doesn't.

The pork broth is perfect, the premium steak is flavorful and tender, and the bulgogi is only mildly sweet and wonderful. Even the mochi served is expertly wrapped in a soft but toothsome rice paper and the ice cream inside is the best you'll find. I can't wait to go back tomorrow<//Text>

<text>Its delicious.  Fun and entertaining. Full bar . All you can eat bbq at your table . They just keep bringing out whatever you desire! $3 more for the hot pot soup ! For which you choose all ingredients and soup base. A must. Loosen your belt, go home happy and full.
Lunch is cheaper menu.
Enjoy and keep this place strong!</text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Great service "team effort". Be careful not to over order as you could be charged for any uneaten food. Our waiter took great of us tho. Highly recommend the bulgogi beef and popcorn chicken. And the healthy herb broth for the hot pot. Best flavoring!</review>

<Time>1533158654889< /Time><resp>None</resp><text>Great first experience. Staff was incredibly friendly. I honestly did not know what to do when I sat down or how it worked. My server took the time to walk me through the procedure. I came in for the all you can eat lunchtime promotion. The portions are quite Hefty for a single person. Well worth the price. Lots of great choices. I personally recommend the beef bulgogi. The sauce bar has many choices to choose from. It is create your own sauce. Bring your chopsticks to mix your sauce and adjust flavor. I do not know if I ordered it or if it came as a starter. Use the steak to grease your grill. Butter is also provided. I will be back and I will be bringing friends 😋</text><Name>spider91 fc</Name>< Gmap_id>

<text>This is a new spot that is clean, well decorated, and with excellent service from servers. The quality of the meat is very good, and there's a pretty decent selection of toppings that you can order in rounds.

You can do BBQ, hotpot, or both. I personally had trouble multi tasking, but I'm sure others would appreciate taking care of both cravings simultaneously. The servers help you adjust the heat, which also helps.

There's also a very comprehensive sauce station that I appreciated. The fruit buffet is also very fresh and generous with portions. I highly recommend this new spot.<//text><gmapID>0x808e347982dbb2bb:0xfe26c00b7a07f4d7< /gmapID>< rating>

<Review>This place is so good! If you're going on the weekend, save your place in line on Yelp because there's almost always a wait.

For the KBBQ, they have great variety of meats (pork belly is my favorite!), and the waiters are very attentive! They change your grill pretty often, and they come around a lot without being too persistent.

For the hot pot I've tried it a little bit, but only when it still had it's soft opening so I can't really attest to how it is now.

Lastly, my favorite thing is the sauce area with the employee recipes. It's so nice being able to make your own sauces.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Good first time experience although only with the Hot Pot. Good variety of meat and veggies, prompt service and attentive. Some more cuts of meat would definitely help. I would love to test drive the BBQ next time.< /review>

First time here. Came w a group of 6 from work. Mainly came for bbq, did not do hot pot this time. We were sat at a booth for 6 which is not ideal if you are all having bbq. For one, the grille is in the middle of 4 of the 6 seats so the last two seats cannot reach the grille. Each seat in the booth has a burner for hotpot. Also if you are on the inside of the booth, you have to evict two of your neighbors if you want to get salad bar or sauces.

I think the hosts should ask if you are having hotpot or bbq before they seat you. If all 6 are having hotpot the booth may be ok. But there are tables with individual chairs with close proximity to  grills.  That would give a lot more freedom.

Otherwise the food was awesome and I'll definitely be back - at a table next time, not a booth</text>

<text>First time going to a kbbq/hot pot hybrid place. Was definitely  worth the few dollars more to have hot pot included. Good selection of meat and can make own dipping sauce. Service was really good and the wait to be expected. Will be back if i am ever in the area again.<//text>< Pictures>

Very good quality first and later on changes to okay..not bad but not as good as first time.. missing some items you can order from other Korean BBQ places..such as kimchi pancakes, stew, spicy rice cake, steamed eggs....but still enjoyed the food.< /review>

<Review>I love eating Korean BBQ, and this place is very good.  I think the next time I go, I'll skip the hot pot and only get the BBQ - I don't want to fill up on soup.  The combo is very affordable if you do want to get both.<//Review><user>113805146522289973766< /user><name>Brian Hauptman</name>< Time>

So glad we have this fantastic place in our neighbor! The whole family love this place. We love the lamb very much. We can do both bbq and hotpot. I am a meat lover so really enjoy this place. They have fruits, salad,different sources you can choose from. The price is really decent for such a great all you can eat meal. Nice place to meet friends too.< /text>

I was here for their soft opening. During this time, Goku takes off the $3 charge for the hot pot add on. Goku is similar to other all you can eat Korean BBQ. It has a very nice menu with a good list of selections. The key differentiator is their hot pot! They provide individual pot for each person in your party (if your party decide to add the hot pot) and each person can pick his or her preferred soup base!

I took one star out for a few minor reasons - 1. Goku doesn't provide dessert, 2. the middle section of the dinning area doesn't has exhaust fan so it would get smoky, 3. location (it's about 2 to 3 miles from major freeway)

Overall I like Goku and I will go back again after the soft opening!<//Review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Text>This place just opened, and this was a soft opening.  I’ll just say let’s give this place another month and see how it rates.  We’ve been to plenty of Korean BBQ’s, such as Gen, and this did not rate as high.  The burners were not adjusted, which means most of our food was either burnt or slightly undercooked.  They were very nice and apologetic though.  The sauce bar and mini salad bar was a nice touch(Gen doesn’t have that), but even the decor seemed unfinished.  What separates this place is that it also has Hot Pot.  Never had that, and didn’t again tonight, so that is unique.  Slightly less expensive than Gen.  But it is only blocks, walking distance, to our house.  So after a meal of all you can eat, we can walk it off.</Text>< gmapID>

Loved it!!! As a hot pot and Korean BBQ aficionado 😁 I can say without hesitation this place is awesome.  Owned by the same group that has QPot, this is new spot is ten times better.  You don't be disappointed.</Text>

Nice Korean all you can eat bbq and hotpot place. Inside actually is very big, lots of seating areas. Full bar. All sorts of beef, chicken, pork and seafood. All meat are in good quality and fresh. If you choose to do both bbq and hotpot you pay $3 more. Even it is big, weekend meal time still long waiting.< /Text>

<time>1563396894215<//time><Rating>3<//Rating><Review>I like the idea of having your own individual hotpot on top of ayce korean bbq.  Unfortunately, I found the food to be really salty.  I'm the kind of person who likes my food on the salty side, so for it to be salty means it's extremely salty.  The kind of salty that makes you drink water all day and wonder why you're still thirsty.  It was salty even without all the dips and accompaniments.

The staff was very friendly though.  They were rushed because it was a busy Mother's Day and everybody, including my party, was a large party of 10, so they were always running around from one table to another.  They always took the time to change our grill and they were always smiling.   We still had a pretty good time even though the food was not that good.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x808e347982dbb2bb:0xfe26c00b7a07f4d7< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Great all you can eat and a good price, never really packed, good soju flavors, and friendly staff. Ambience is a bit bland though. Overall great place to go as a small group since tables only up to 6 people.<//Text>

Great Korean BBQ place very similar to my favorite place in Uijeongbu, Korea. Meat had great flavor overall, though their spicy samgyupsal marinade was less of a marinade and more of a paste. Service was quick and polite. Prices where very fair.<//text>

Great price and service. The only complaint is that the meat took days to come out and they get mad at you when you change the temperature for the grill (always on low).</Text>

The food was delicious (especially the bulgogi) and it was always delivered quickly to our table to be cooked.  A big thank you to our waiter Qui and the rest of the staff for being very friendly and attentive to our table!  Will definitely be stopping by here again!! :)< /review>< Pics>

I've recommended the place to multiple people and I've only been here once! Came here after being told the wait at Gen was over an hour, and I'm glad we made that decision. This place is spacious.

We did the kbbq and hot pot combo. For $3 more it's a pretty good deal. It gets a bit hectic when you trying to monitor your hot pot and cook meat on the grill. We ended up somewhat abandoning our hot pot and focusing more on the kbbq. It was nice to get the noodles and veggies cooked in the hot pot, though.

Our waiter, Nathan, was super helpful and pretty attentive. They got a bit busy, but he was always around. Their sauce bar is pretty extensive and they've got tons of fruit available. Their ban chan is also delicious. I will definitely be back here!!</review>

I would agree in general with other Google reviewers but only (4.5 Stars). Goku is unique in that you can BBQ and/or Hot Pot (soup) at the same time for $3 more.
Goku has beautiful white marble entry/ waiting area which leads into a grey & stainless steel dining room with individual table grills/hot pots with bench or chair seating. Note: center section has no overhead smoke eaters because of the high ceilings so could be smokey.
The BBQ meats & seafood were very fresh & high quality generous 1st serving (see photos)! The various vegetable side dishes were unlimited, fresh & tasty.
My server, Alvin, was a pro & gave me advice on what to do & order first time!
The BBQ grills are changed periodically to prevent burned sauces/marinades from affecting the taste of other meats.
The do-it-yourself Sauce Bar for dipping BBQ is difficult to prepare from 10+ suggested recipes! The limited fresh fruit was chilled to perfection and was very refreshing after non-stop BBQ!
There's a full beer, wine, sake & soku drink menu and sit down bar with 4 flat screen TV's.
Be prepared to wait Friday evening and all day Saturday and Sunday for a table but the experience is worth the wait😁
I don't like to wait when I'm hungry so I will be back for early lunch during the week.
What's missing is an excellent single bite dessert like green tea ice cream or mango sherbet when you get the bill!
Also missing is a Happy Hour promotion for the after work crowd? Thanks for reading.</text>

Wide tables, and wide chairs! Loved the food. Limited side dishes ( in my opinion) wanted lettuce but all they had a was a spring salad at the  so called salad.bar. but over all decent meat. AYCE kbbq, hotpot, or both. What I loved.about it was the amount of space the restaurant has. I normally come out with a strong smelling like kbbq food, but this place was pretty decent.< /text>

I truly like this hot pot bbq place. Fast service great meat quality and selection and nice ambience! I honestly think they are better than Gen. Aside from the lightings are a bit brighter, they offer fruits and wide array of sauces! Definitely recommend! In addition to my old review I want to give a shout out to YENA the manager and all her crew like Kim Brian Jacky all of them ! The best service, staff are super engaging friendly and fun! Definitely the only Korean bbq and hot pot place I go to with friends and family ❤️❤️< /Text>

In A Nutshell:

-Goku Korean BBQ is perfectly placed in the SoBay (South Bay).
-This place is huge inside, so if you have a big family or want to throw a nice shindig, you should eat here.
-The bar is very big too w/ lot's of choices to get toasted.
-The dinner price for AYCE KBBQ is $27.99 & if you really have the munchies, you can throw in another $3.00 so you can gorge yourself on the AYCE HOT POT too.
-Trust me though, the KBBQ is more than enough to satisfy your hunger.
-The service is very good too.

Overall, this is a nice AYCE Korean BBQ spot in San Jose.  Come eat here.</text>

Solid Korean bbq and hotpot. Their service is phenomenal for an ayce place. Note, make sure you find the Groupon for a free 15% cash back the first time you visit! (You'll have to register for a Groupon account and add your credit card).<//Review>

(Translated by Google) The price/performance ratio of this restaurant is not high. It is said that all the salted meat of Korean BBQ is more salty. The price of holiday and dinner is more expensive, but I don’t think there is any difference between usual and lunch. Adding 3 yuan can eat hot pot, but not a Others can add it alone, but all the people should add it together. This kind of option really doesn't like it. It is quite good to give the two stars a waiter.

这个餐馆的性价比不高，说是韩国BBQ所有腌制的肉类较咸，假日和晚餐的价格较贵，但不觉得与平时和午餐有什么分别，加3块钱可以吃火锅，但不是个别人可以单独添加而是要全部所有的人一起加，这样的选项实在不喜欢，给二粒星是服务员还挺好，< /Text>
