Love this facility.

The people who work here are part of it being great.

It was easy to sign up. The prices were good and they made it easy for auto pay with receipts</text>

Had the pleasure in meeting two awesome employees Angie and Megan. These two were very welcoming , great personality. They made it easy to decide my options. I had 4 other places I still had to visit but after the first 20 min I knew this was the place for me. So I’m thankful to them and I definitely recommend them 100%.<//Review>

Megan and the team at Storage Solutions are incredibly warm and helpful. This was my first time ever renting a storage unit and they made the process easy and stress-free. The location is indoors, which adds a layer of security. You can purchase supplies there as well, I purchased my lock from them. Reasonable rates and friendly, helpful staff characterized my experience with Storage Solutions and I can't recommend them enough. Thank you Storage Solutions!!<//Review>

I have been here for decades and when storage solutions took over several years ago they were many updated changes. They painted the whole storage area, added many security cameras and added new bright storage numbers, maps and signage.  The restrooms are always stocked and clean.  The concrete floors are not only sweep on a regular basis, but the concrete is mopped on occasion.  My favorite is the key code gate which allows for longer hours (7AM-7PM) and access during holidays.

The employees here are extremely helpful and very friendly.  They seem to really enjoy working there and always greet me with a smile.

I highly recommend using Storage Solutions for all your storage needs!</text>

I would like to add to my Review:
I want to thank Catherine @ Storage Solutions on Cinnabar in San Jose, CA. for her  Continuing Assistance, Caring, Professionalism and for her General Concern & Help During Some of the Most Difficult and Trying Times of My Life. Her Attitude is Always Great and I Must Say That This World is a Much Softer, Easier and Tolerable Place With Her In It. God Bless You, Catherine. I Truly Appreciate Your Thoughtfulness and Your Genuine Kindness. It is So Refreshing!!</Review>

<review>I was impressed from the moment I walked into this place. Catherine and Angie were very welcoming and helpful. You can tell that they really do care about you and are proud of their workplace. This place is situated way in the back of some dead end streets, but is far from being a dead end place. Very clean, very professional staff, very fair prices, and appears to be a safe and secure storage facility.< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>I have been using storage solutions for a couple of years now and have been very satisfied with the facility as well as the staff, and it's the cheapest place around. Katherine goes above and beyond customer service expectations and always has an upbeat, happy, and positive attitude. The newest staff member Angie has been very nice and fits right in there.  I have only delt with two other men that work there, a couple of times, but they were both friendly and helpful. I would recommend Storage Solutions to anyone.<//Text>< Pictures>

These guys will Nickle and dime you.  They quote you a price and don’t mention all the additional fees until the contract has been drawn up and you are about to sign.  Additionally, when you leave they will look for ways to squeeze more money out of you.  No flexibility with customer service to actually serve the customer.  Make sure you read and understand ALL the fine print because if they can take advantage of the contract to make an extra buck they will.<//text>

<name>Chris Johnson</name>< Review>
The worst. Having been here since 2012, I'll be going elsewhere. The manager fined me $25. for using bad language. I told her I wouldn't pay it...she refused my rent payment. Claimed she couldn't take a partial payment. So I printed the invoice I was sent for the rent and submitted it with a money order. The fine was paid first and then the rent. After I made it clear I would not pay a "swear fine". Especially after I heard her cursing a customer herself. After I made it clear I was only paying the invoice. Now I have a late fee and a lien against my property!!!

Fortunately, I am a U.S. Navy veteran and one of our benefits is pro bono legal advice. I intend to small claim both Storage Solutions and her personally.

I can give you other reasons You don't want to rent here...
It's illegal to store flammable liquids in a unit, probably a fire hazard. Manager allows a landscaper to store his gas-powered tools in the facility. With gas tanks. Talk about not caring about all of the other customers at risk.
Manager tells potential customers insurance is mandated by the state. Oops, no it isn't.Storage Solutions requires it because they get a kickback from the insurance company.
They raise the rent every year by the maximum allowed by law...although I have heard some tenants complain it was more than once a year. In my case, they raised it one month before the anniversary date. When brought to Managers attention, she stuttered for an answer. Told me she would get back to me. She didn't.
You might think twice about renting here. There are lower priced, more convenient storage rentals.< /Review>

<text>Location is right in Downtown San Jose making it easy for our business to access.  All units are indoors but my 18 feet truck can go right into the building making it easy to load and unload.  New management and staff seem to be great and due to the access and location, will continue to rent here for long time.  They are doing some upgrades and enhancing security with new gate system and cameras.  Can't beat the price on rental rates in the area.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x808fcb60e1cf4e6f:0x9caec8e8a3a074cd<//Gmap_id></record>

The manager is an absolute doll. She knows us all and is kind. She does her best to go above and beyond for even the  challenging situations and still makes it look easy. And beyond reasonable pricing.< /Text>

Bathroom is locked must get key from office which is locked when employee is at lunch or doing work at the facility.   Don't plan on being able to use a bathroom here will need to drive to use bathroom.    They also don't have any carts to use which they used to have.    Staff is Rude.</text>

Discount Flooring is awesome! Our carpet and vinyl flooring look beautiful.

From the office worker Wayne to installers Mark & Mark and the owner Ethan, this is by far the best company we have ever dealt with.<//text>

Jonnie was so helpful and patient while we picked out carpeting. The job was done professionally by Jason and done in half the time.
Everyone at Discount Flooring is nice and totally on top of things. Even their dog, Bear is good.
Thanks everyone for being the best flooring store in the area< /Review>

<Review>This company came recommended by my contractor, Gary Delphenich, and they delivered!  The work was done very quickly by John & Bryce.  My bedroom went from yucky 20 yr old carpet, to beautiful hickory hardwood in a day and a half!!  And the price was very reasonable.  Would recommend Flooring Discount Center as my top choice.  ThankYou!!< /Review>< Response>

Everyone at the Flooring Discount Center is very professional and knowledgeable.  My order was handed in an expedient and efficient manner! Our bedroom is now finished and a has a very updated warmth.
I-am currently planning on having  our living room recarpeted and looking forward to working with them!

We have found both the management and installers to be very professional, courteous, competitively priced, and quite competent.  Their personnel show up on time, and their work is high quality.

Ethan and Crew are exceptional.  Great variety  of product, good prices, fast service.
Mark, the installer, is an oldtime pro who coved our bath floor as it should be!

Hooray for Hometown service and value.
We will return!< /text>

This is not a huge store, but there IS a huge selection of quality flooring from which to choose. Customer service is beyond awesome, no doubt due to their many years of experience!  I walked in with a vague idea, and Johnni and Ethan provided excellent suggestions so I could make an informed decision for my wood flooring and carpeting.  The installation crew did a great job, and I am very pleased with the results!</Review>

<Review>Installation was very efficient and professional; the guys were in and out in less than four days. Installer  Paul took great care moving my furniture around, made perfect cuts around the hard to reach places, and everything went smoothly. The vinyl plank flooring and new carpet look great! Ethan, the owner, suggested the best looking materials and colors. The price was outstanding with no hidden costs! This was a great experience and I highly recommend Flooring Discount Center!!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>The flooring is beautiful and perfect and Jonnie helped me pick out the perfect flooring for my color scheme. The installer Daniel went above and beyond to help my husband fix things like the heater vent can, seat the toilets, plug plumbing holes.....stuff he didn’t have to do. He was very professional, focused and fast! I would recommend this company and their amazing team every day of the week! I am very pleased with the flooring quality and all the baseboards were done perfectly! Thank you so much for helping us get our home perfect for the selling it.
VERY VERY pleased with their work and team! Thank you so much ☺️ ALL of you at Discount Flooring!!
Every time I walk in the house I’m amazed at the awesome work and how beautiful it is!!
Thank you thank you!!< /Review>< pictures>

They gave me a quote the same day I called, let me take as many samples as needed to make my decision.  They were able to do the work within three weeks.  We went out of town and they completed all work within our time frame and did an amazing job.  Super clean, attention to detail...I just can’t say enough!  We are extremely pleased!</Text>< Pics>

ethan and his crew do a great job- knowledgeable about flooring, good selection, good prices.  Their installer did a super job on a floor that was not easy- it had a lot of angles.< /Text>

Excellent service. Jonnie allows you to take all the time you need picking out flooring- they have tons of selections in all price ranges.  Then, the installers Ethan and his crew make it so easy for you in that they’ll move the big pieces of furniture for you.  Our new floors have transformed our little old vacation home in Morro Bay. They leveled the floor and installed new baseboards for us too.  I can’t say enough good things about this family owned business.  Flooring Discount Center might have “discount” in the name but they are top notch with totally reasonable prices.  Thank you Jonnie and Ethan.   Our family and friends love the floors!!!<//review>

Good products, good prices and great people.  They do what they say they are going to do, when they say they are going to do it.  I like no surprises and a good end result.  They delivered.  Do yourself a favor and give them a chance to earn your business.<//Text>

< Review>
This was the worst experience in home remodeling that I've ever experienced! The installer David was very rude as well as the owner's wife. The quality of work was not up to par. The baseboards popped off everywhere, mismatched seams in vinyl flooring and he messed up the walls and paint in my house so bad that now I have to pay to have the entire house repainted! They were promt in fixing the issues but I'm not happy with my experience with this company! Never again!</Review>

I have used several flooring installers in the past, and I must say that Flooring Discount Center in Morro Bay is the best ever in assistance with selection of  floorings, their unmatched pricing, and their superberb installers. We are continuing with additional installation to complement the work  already completed</Text>

Jonnie was so helpful and patient while we picked out carpeting. The job was done professionally by Jason and done in half the time.
Everyone at Discount Flooring is nice and totally on top of things. Even their dog, Bear is good.

<Text>This company came recommended by my contractor, Gary Delphenich, and they delivered!  The work was done very quickly by John & Bryce.  My bedroom went from yucky 20 yr old carpet, to beautiful hickory hardwood in a day and a half!!  And the price was very reasonable.  Would recommend Flooring Discount Center as my top choice.  ThankYou!!< /Text>< pictures>

Everyone at the Flooring Discount Center is very professional and knowledgeable.  My order was handed in an expedient and efficient manner! Our bedroom is now finished and a has a very updated warmth.
I-am currently planning on having  our living room recarpeted and looking forward to working with them!

We have used Flooring Discount Center in Morro Bay three times now in the past several years for our flooring and carpet needs.  We have found both the management and installers to be very professional, courteous, competitively priced, and quite competent.  Their personnel show up on time, and their work is high quality.  Would definitely recommend them for your flooring needs, you will not be disappointed.<//review>

Ethan and Crew are exceptional.  Great variety  of product, good prices, fast service.
Mark, the installer, is an oldtime pro who coved our bath floor as it should be!

Hooray for Hometown service and value.
We will return!< /review>

<review>This is not a huge store, but there IS a huge selection of quality flooring from which to choose. Customer service is beyond awesome, no doubt due to their many years of experience!  I walked in with a vague idea, and Johnni and Ethan provided excellent suggestions so I could make an informed decision for my wood flooring and carpeting.  The installation crew did a great job, and I am very pleased with the results!</review>< response>

<Review>Installation was very efficient and professional; the guys were in and out in less than four days. Installer  Paul took great care moving my furniture around, made perfect cuts around the hard to reach places, and everything went smoothly. The vinyl plank flooring and new carpet look great! Ethan, the owner, suggested the best looking materials and colors. The price was outstanding with no hidden costs! This was a great experience and I highly recommend Flooring Discount Center!!< /Review>< Time>

< review>
The flooring is beautiful and perfect and Jonnie helped me pick out the perfect flooring for my color scheme. The installer Daniel went above and beyond to help my husband fix things like the heater vent can, seat the toilets, plug plumbing holes.....stuff he didn’t have to do. He was very professional, focused and fast! I would recommend this company and their amazing team every day of the week! I am very pleased with the flooring quality and all the baseboards were done perfectly! Thank you so much for helping us get our home perfect for the selling it.
VERY VERY pleased with their work and team! Thank you so much ☺️ ALL of you at Discount Flooring!!
Every time I walk in the house I’m amazed at the awesome work and how beautiful it is!!
Thank you thank you!!< /review>

I simply can’t express enough how happy we are that we chose this local family owned business!  From start to finish, the experience was stellar!  They gave me a quote the same day I called, let me take as many samples as needed to make my decision.  They were able to do the work within three weeks.  We went out of town and they completed all work within our time frame and did an amazing job.  Super clean, attention to detail...I just can’t say enough!  We are extremely pleased!</Text>

Excellent service. Jonnie allows you to take all the time you need picking out flooring- they have tons of selections in all price ranges.  Then, the installers Ethan and his crew make it so easy for you in that they’ll move the big pieces of furniture for you.  Our new floors have transformed our little old vacation home in Morro Bay. They leveled the floor and installed new baseboards for us too.  I can’t say enough good things about this family owned business.  Flooring Discount Center might have “discount” in the name but they are top notch with totally reasonable prices.  Thank you Jonnie and Ethan.   Our family and friends love the floors!!!<//review>

<review>This was the worst experience in home remodeling that I've ever experienced! The installer David was very rude as well as the owner's wife. The quality of work was not up to par. The baseboards popped off everywhere, mismatched seams in vinyl flooring and he messed up the walls and paint in my house so bad that now I have to pay to have the entire house repainted! They were promt in fixing the issues but I'm not happy with my experience with this company! Never again!</review><user_name>Jaci Smith< /user_name><pics>None</pics><date>1516392196708</date></record></dataset><record>

I have used several flooring installers in the past, and I must say that Flooring Discount Center in Morro Bay is the best ever in assistance with selection of  floorings, their unmatched pricing, and their superberb installers. We are continuing with additional installation to complement the work  already completed<//Review>

If you want to make yourself sicker go to Kaiser. If you want to wait for a doctor for months, go to Kaiser. If you want to see a psychiatrist, DON'T go to Kaiser or you may end up at the wrong end of a rope gun or knife .....waiting. And waiting..... for inappropriate doctors and inappropriate care.
Are there worse health care options out there? Absolutely. But try them all don't just settle for the worst.

<Text>Kaiser is the worst hospital ever. My mother was admitted to the ER with covid 3 days ago, sat in a bed in the ER for 2 days before being moved to an isolation room late last night. Once she was asked to take the covid shot she said if she could be shown a list of ingredients, bc she is allergic to several things they commonly have in shots, the nurse and Dr got real hateful and wouldnt even try to answer that for her. So she told them no, until they could answer her questions, it was a no. After that she was basically left in an isolation room, hardly checked on all day. Their entire demeanor changed. She asked the nurse for water and her reply was "this isn't a luxury hotel". Are you serious? Water is a basic human NECESSITY!! She was pretty much left for dead in there. She called crying for us to come get her BC they were not doing ANYTHING for her there that we couldn't do at home. At least we will make sure she has water. And we also do not live in a luxury hotel, but we have compassion. We care. We'd give water to any person who needed it. Kaiser really needs an overhaul on some nurses and protocol. Shame shame</Text></record>

Too often left in the dark. I was brought into the ER in extreme confusion. Left alone and terrified. Little communication with caregivers. Periods of extreme anxiety without attention or medication.  Patients should b more included in the particulars of ,their case.<//Review>

Kaiser strung me along for over 10 years accepting over $2,000 a month and gave me the run around until my insurance ran out. When I got medical and went to community Health Services I got much better care I am alive today interesting good luck< /text>

<review>My mother was brought here in acute psychological distress and the ER dr. immediately had her committed and sent to a different facility even though she was not suicidal. She was forced to stay in that facility for 72 hours and never received any sort of treatment or medication.
My grandmother was also brought here because of a heart attack and the ER dr. Had here immediately put on what was essentially hospice protocol. It wasn’t until my grandmother’s personal physician insisted she be treated that she received any actual treatment for her condition and that was days after she had arrived.
Avoid the ER here if you can.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<user_name>Spencer Davison< /user_name><review>The absolute worst ER experience I've ever had. I blacked out and was taken to the ER. Doctors did nothing for me and wanted to discharge me to the waiting room at 3am with no ride and significantly impared cognitive function. I had an anxiety attack and they must have thought I was faking it because they yelled at me and said fine we'll place you on a psych hold and you won't be able to see your wife or your kids. 6 hours later I finally had a consult with a mental health clinician who tried to write off my symptoms. She finally did get me a xanax to calm me down but this facility let me wait over 6 hours with a panic attack and refused to help me. Even the security officer who was watching me was trying to get the nurse to help me and told me he's experienced the same thing and tried calming me down. He could tell I was not doing good but no one would help me. I was traveling and normally a huge supporter of kaiser. I would have never been treated this way at my local kaiser (fresno.)

I recommend you avoid this hospital at all costs. They will not help you.<//review><Gmap_id>0x8084387d9f0ef9c5:0x7b084b9c2a07a303</Gmap_id><UserId.>102205497096336087468</UserId.>< Resp>

You get average to below average care at this facility. Most departments are chronically understaffed and existing staff is overworked and that leads to mistakes. Had several poor experiences here with wife and kids. Less diversity and inclusion, and more doctors, nurses and technicians would do this company good.<//Review>

<Text>I took my child into the ER on Sunday.  Patients were sitting outside with chairs not six feet apart.  Many patients were not wearing masks.  I took pictures and have reported it to public Health.  A person inside was being tested for Covid next to my son. It seems like people whom they suspect may have Covid should not be in the same area as other patients. As for the patients outside not wearing masks and not socially distancing themselves, they were possibly infecting other patients And we're definitely not following proper protocol. I reported it to the security guard on duty and he told me I should call his supervisor when he returned during the week. I contacted the supervisor and have heard nothing in return   I also have reached out to Kaiser and they have not returned my calls. Beware!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

There has been a mix of rude employees and polite a mix of correct and incorrect directions and multiple errors by the doctor's themselves. I never thought I'd have to warn people not to trust the facility I'm forced to use. Pretty sad just look at there website, the lack of effort and care is obvious.<//Text>

<time>1544223690512<//time><rating>1</rating><review>The pharmacy at MOB 1 has repeatedly messed up my son's medications. They have repeatedly misread doctors' directions by confusing the volume for the number of refills; they have misfiled his prescription, so it took 5 minutes just to find it; they have repeatedly forced me to wait to talk to a pharmacist about a "new" prescription that we've had for over a year; just today they have told us to pick up a prescription only for us to find out they cancelled ALL of his prescriptions for no reason. We have talked to numerous staff including the manager to fix these problems. We have had our son's doctors and specialists and their staffs talk to them on our behalf, including the head of pediatrics in SF. Things have only managed to get worse. We have made a formal complaint, but knowing Kaiser, we'll get a response in writing from someone who didn't take the time to fully read, understand, or investigate the issue.
EDIT: Just came in to get another prescription only to find that someone did not refrigerate it. They had to compound it again and told me to wait. I went for a walk and saw my son's name on thr board, which I assumed meant it was ready. It wasn't. More waiting. Every. Single. Thing. They manage to mess up, it's amazing.</review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x8084387d9f0ef9c5:0x7b084b9c2a07a303</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Highly professional, well educated and friendly staff.
Kaiser Permanente Santa Rosa has been voted one of the #1 hospitals in northern California. That is evident by the compassionate care I have received here.
The main hospital has a modern layout with three separate airy buildings. Often times there will be a pianist playing a Baby Grand in the reception area.
The many volunteers helping lost souls find their way is much appreciated.
Since the late 80's the campus has expanded to five Medical Office Buildings with three more to come.< /text>< Date>

Very professional, helpful, and friendly people working there. And they are saving my sister in laws' life. An excellent hospital.

<username>C21 Old Account</username><time>1529944173077<//time><rate>1< /rate><Text>The unethical nature of Kaiser’s member services and billing department is like none I have experienced. A recent 4 month experience of dealing with their billing department over a $79.24 balance led to the numerous threats of cancelling my entire families’ medical coverage within 30 days. I was told on three separate occasions this $79.24 balance was a billing mistake and would be removed immediately, although it may take a few months to reflect. In February, March and April I made three separate phone calls, each lasting about an hour, regarding this mysterious charge on my bill that no one could explain. I was reassured that it was being handled and would be removed within a billing period. Then in May I started receiving medical coverage termination letters.

I then called Kaiser back a 4th time , just to have a manager ignore the detailed notes on my account where it was clearly documented that three previous representatives that this was a billing issue and would be removed. She informed me that they were all mistaken and my medical coverage would be terminated in two weeks if I didn’t make a payment. Struggling family held financially hostage by Kaiser’s bureaucracy.</Text>< pics>

Got seen for a dislocated toe. Doctor was extremely rude as was the nurse. They insisted that it was gout (I went to another doctor who said it was obvious it was a dislocation). The other doctor was appalled at the things i was told at Kaiser and was very angry that doctors who are so incompetent could possibly have interactions with the public. I will never return to this ER again. Thank God i got to a real doctor and was able to get help.
P.s. stay away from the doctor who looks like a fugly Dwight from the office.<//Review>

I am really disappointed that Kaiser does NOT have a birthing tub or any other options besides being stuck in a bed-in their birthing center. It is the furthest thing from nature to be stuck with monitors on you the entire time you are in labor, restricting movement and making labor very slow. There are showers, but no tubs. My wife wanted our children to be there to see their sister be born and they also did not want that either, which was upsetting to us as well. It just felt very sterile and not very family oriented at all. My wife loves her doctors and our pediatrician, but we were really disappointed in this aspect of Kaiser.< /Review>

<Review>Being from Oregon our Kaiser is amazing, coming here was a little put off, seemed like the ER didn't really have it together, didn't even get a wrist band, a bottle of pee was in our ER room and the doctor didn't give us any paperwork and the check out nurse *LaTonya* had to run and find him....She *LaTonya* was really the only nice personal staff member we met. 3 stars because we did get seen and did get meds but the staff wasn't the best and the pee well....< /Review>< Gmap_id>

There's a member service staff I've met today was terrible, discriminate, judging without knowing your side of the story and was very rude.  Didn't catch her name but her office is right by the front counter, I think she's an Hispanic. I will file a complaint with her supervisor, this is unexceptionable.<//Review>

Had knee replace. Surgery November 21, 2018. Feels like brand new knee. Works great! Excellent Surgeon! Thanks Dr Fuji! Wonderful care by nursing and all other staff!! Was Medi-Cal patient at time. No discrimination due to financial status either. All patients treated same across the board-with TLC, compassion and empathy. Been Kaiser member since birth with brief gap living in sonoma county b4 Kaiser up here. I can't say enough good things about their system of healthcare. Cost effective, love the 'one-stop-shopping', no bouncing all over town Trying to fill Rx's, etc. Pharm great too! Quick, reliable, efficient, personable care. All modalities under same roof, less driving, better communication between Doctors etc. Learn the system, read your fine print and learn how to use system and it Will work well for you too!!  10-09-18 Just wanted to add...Been going here now since May 2018 usually go on Fridays to pick up meds and must say, compared to Santa Rosa pharmacies and their 15 min rule ( from order to pick up shd be no more than 15 min)...They very sadly fail the test. I realize it's Friday pms but geez...2 hrs???? ...for one med? Seriously?? Prhaps this rule is just a Santa Rosa guideline, I don't know but I am diabetic and suffer w chronic pain and a wait that long causes distress. Yes, I will b going to member services. While there I spoke with 5 different people who all had similar complaint. Hmmm< /review>

< Review>
I asked the lady for a completely different set then what she gave me not to mention my nails are lumpy not even filed right and it’s not even ombré . I made an appointment for 4:00 they took me in at 4:45 so unprofessional . They were lying to customers saying the wait time was 10 min when they were backed up and the wait was probably more than an hour. I will never come here again .  She also used different size nails on me they all look so different some are wider than the other ones and some are longer than the other ones .She didn’t even clean the bottom of my nails up I left with dirty lumpy nails . She didn’t even use enough nail polish on my nails I can see a clear chunk on the tips of my nails . She was being rude the whole time yanking on my arm . It’s overpriced and dirty just save your money for another shop by far the worst experience I have ever had.</Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>This place uses cheap products, and the technician I got, didn’t know how to properly trim toe nails or paint them without making a mess. Been here twice, both times for a pedicure, and both times my polish chipped extremely fast. Within two week they were already looking terrible. I have been religiously getting my toe nails done every 3-4 weeks for years and I have never had my polish chip so fast. Thinking back I’m not sure they use a base coat. The polish on the rack looks old and cheap. No OPI what so ever.

We just moved to the area and someone recommended them to me. My first experience here was not as bad as the first so I chalked it up to having a less qualified technician and I’m always willing to give a second chance. However my second experience was so bad I’m writing this review.

After politely pointing it out, the technician recommended that I see a foot doctor to trim my nails or next time have another technician give me the service I’m requesting. Even tho I was dissatisfied with the service, I paid my bill and tipped the technician to make sure they understood that I’m not being cheap, it’s a matter of having standards for a service I will gladly pay for. It really is sad that an establishment would be okay with saying that NEXT time I will receive the service to my satisfaction that I paid for this time.< /text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80900c8e6ce50d3f:0x4919d9899d4ea714<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

My friends brought me here today for Manicure with Shellac gel and i really loved the way my nails turned out. So amazing!!! My technician was really sweet and knew a lot of designs. She also helped me pick the right color for my nails and did a wonderful job. I would give this salon 5 stars for cleanliness, professional staffs, high quality works for reasonable price and great customer services. Highly recommended!<//Text>

<review>I was a very loyal customer here at Allure. I would go every 2 weeks but I only like Rose to be my technician. Well this time I went in as just a walk in and received terrible customer service nobody even acknowledge me or anybody else I came with. Due to Rose being unavailable I went ahead and let Lynn do my nails.... WORST decision ever! My nails are ugly , the shape is terrible I paid extra for gel & yeah it's chipping already. During my time in Lynn's chair I was very uncomfortable, she rushed her work and when I asked questions she never had an answer. I came in w| two other young lady , one who only needed a nail fixed and the other was a child just getting her nails painted. 3 people got in chairs before them! Not to mention, I get my lip waxed regularly this time I'm all broken out around my mouth and it's terrible. I will not be returning to Allure , their service has ran me off for good !< /review><Resp>None< /Resp>< user_id>

I really like this place because the staff here are nice and the place itself is super clean! They have a good deal for all the services! I really like the pink and white full set in here look so natural An Elegant at the same time. I recommend you guys call in first because it's got a little bit packed during rush hour so just keep that in mind< /Review>

<Text>Customer Service is very poor, no one is ever at the front desk to direct customer to a seat with a technician.  Representatives are also rude and unapproachable. They act as though they're wearing blinders and don't greet customers. They also lack creativity when it comes to nail designs. Not worth the trip for this kind of experience. Prices are cheaper than many but lack skill and common courtesy. I want peace and organization when I come on my spa day. Customer Service goes a long way with me. Representatives are quick to argue with customers.</Text>< pics>

First off, no one was at the front desk to greet or direct. I was waiting for about 5 minutes (which is a big plus) until I was told it was my turn to get a gel manicure. During my manicure, I was only given cuticle cream on one hand. My nails had a bit and pieces of gel nail polish on the sides of my nail. Despite only have bits and pieces of the gel nail polish on my nails, the lady doing my nails decided to grind my nails and kept going which made my nails ache and hurt all over (my nails became sensitive and ached for almost two weeks). The lady didn't even bother to clean the white residue that nails leave when they are grinned. The white residue was on my hand for the entire time after. The gel manicure was poorly done as you can still see my nail, the gel nail polish I had prior (the lady did not even bother to take off the entire nail polish I had before) and the nail polish it looks like someone touched the nail polish before it was dry. Surprisingly, my nails have lasted almost two weeks without cracking. I paid $25 for this manicure and was told that all manicures were $20. It was a big rip off and the worst experience in my life. I will not be coming here again!</Text><Name>Jennifer Perez< /Name>< resp>

<review>They just lightened my trip to CA up a lot! Had to wait for my friend for more than an hour at the airport so she suggested she could take me to her regular nail place so we could have some quality time together and she could make it up for me. They did a good job impressing me and I have been to a lot of places before. Great service. Way qualified technicians and good well known products. The place is clean and very organized. Considering the quality of service they provide and quality of products they use, I think their price is pretty hard to beat. If you are in the are, you definitely should give it a try, totally worth it!</review><Gmap_id>0x80900c8e6ce50d3f:0x4919d9899d4ea714< /Gmap_id><UserId.>111557822376819946634</UserId.>< Rate>

<review>This place has not only horrible RUDE SERVICE but 2 days after getting a full gel set 6 nails completely fell off. When I went back they charged another 10 on top of 40.00 and the so called tech said well I didn't do your nails that's why I charge u so not even 24hrs later 3 nails fell off again n they are all lifted! As I'm here again the tech said sit down as she proceeded to cut one nail not even file n gets up to sit at another station n talk in her cell phone I'm still here 1/2 he later waiting</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

I was reluctant to make an appointment here based on a few bad reviews- BUT I am so glad I did!!! First of all- the clientele was a little rough (which explains the bad reviews- people wanting something for nothing, complaining just to get something free), but the atmosphere was great. Make an appointment- there was a huge wait but because I had an appointment I was sat down immediately. I received exactly what I asked for.<//text>

They have really bad customer service. Took my niece and her gel color chipped two days later, when we went back to let them know they refused to fix and were charging her for a fill ($24) in order to fix the problem.</review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>We love Banderas Pet Hospital & Boarding.  We have been bringing our dog Rosie there for the last three years.  Dr. Cooper is so good with her and she really keeps a close eye on her health.  She is very open about prices and writes prescription I can send through Chewy which saves us so much.  Plus, she really talks to you about your pet and even sent us information on Cushing's disease when Rosie was diagnosed with.  We are now bringing our new little puppy to her.  Also, our pup Ivy will start the Board and Training next week and I can't wait to see the difference it will make.    Everyone there is caring and supportive, always.  Best experience I ever had with our different dogs.< /text>< pics>

<Text>Dr. Cooper and her support staff are the best.  They are responsive and caring and it is greatly appreciated.  Sometimes it really seems Dr. Cooper thinks that my doggie is a part of her extended family.  Most recently, her staff attended to an emergency Dixie had on an extremely busy day of surgery for them and I will be forever grateful for the time that Dr. Cooper spent talking to me about Dixie's case later that night.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1621549104353, 'text': 'We are so grateful for your kind words.

<review>Dr. Cooper and Rachel and rest of the staff back in Banderas Pet Hospital took care of our pooch Jagger really quick.
Follow ups and the professionalism were great. That's the only place our dog is happy to go in without any problem, it means he's been well treated. Thank you guys. :)</review>< user>

What a wonderful, warm environment with knowledgeable doctors and staff! They treated our Jack with great care and explained what was likely going on with him, offering a methodical approach to diagnosis and treatment. Jack is in excellent hands with Drs. Cooper and Brown and the rest of the team at Banderas Pet Hospital!< /text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Review>We love the Doctors and Staff at Banderas Pet Hospital. They have taken amazing care of our new puppy and we moved vets to have our 2 year old dog treated here as well. Dr. Brown and Dr. Cooper are very experienced, have the patients and owners best interest in mind, and are very upfront and transparent about pricing.

We have also put both of our dogs in the board and train programs that are open now at Banderas. Dan Cooper is extremely experienced and his approach and training style always has the dogs best interest in mind. He creates individual programs for each dog and is great to work with and learn from.

Thank you Banderas Team!!< /Review>< UserId.>

Wonderful pet clinic/hospital for your furry loved ones!  Dr. Cooper and staff are caring and treat your pet as if their own.  I have taken my other furry family member to another clinic on Santa Margarita Parkway and my dog acted "off" and scared for a week later.  Will not return to that office.
My pets are not "afraid" to go to Banderas Pet Hospital with  Dr. Cooper and staff!< /review>

Very thankful that I found this clinic. The staff is so incredibly kind, professional and caring. I brought my Sheprador puppy here at 8 weeks old and Dr. Cooper & Dr. Brown took such great care of him. I will definitely continue taking my pup to this amazing team!< /Review>

All the staff were respectful, both doctors called and checked in on us, making themselves available to answer any questions and after it was over we received a hand written card with touching sentiments from each staff member. I highly recommend.<//Review>< user_name>

<text>Absolute skimps, was charged $200-$300 just for an x-ray. Blood test $100-$200 and medication for $60-$150. Went to a different pet clinic in Santa Barbara and got a blood test,      X-ray and diagnosis with medication for $250. Banderas should be ashamed of taking excessive money for minimal work. Especially when it’s your loved pet with medical problems.

Sincerely
Disappointed.</text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>All of the staff was welcoming, warm, thorough in explaining in detail my questions, and so loving on my dog Oreo. It's hard finding a trustworthy and honest Veterinarian these days, but BPH really calmed my nerves as a pet owner and I really appreciated everything about them. Their statement of wanting to provide the best care and loving animals is obvious in their attitude and demeanor. Also when we were there, a few dogs were coming in and a few were leaving so there was a bit of a scuffle in the front area, but the staff handled it calmly and perfectly and were so sweet. Love this place and surprisingly so does Oreo! I've never seen so many dogs wagging their tails going in and out of a Vet...haha<//Text>< Pictures>

Dr Jenna Cooper and her staff are wonderful.  I’ve been a client for many years, with my dogs and cats. Dr. Cooper is hands down, my favourite nearby vet. (I’ve been to all of them and Banderas is a keeper)< /text>

<review>We have been going to Banderas ever since my puppy had an upset tummy about 3 years ago and the Vet we were going to could not fit us in that day, but Banderas did. I am so glad that happened because Dr Cooper is so wonderful and has been so kind to us and our now two dogs. I never feel as though they are pushing anything my dogs don’t actually need to live a full and happy life. We have two little boys and I have them with me most of the time and have never had a problem bringing them in with me for our doggie check ups. There are even toys out in the waiting room to keep them busy for the usually short wait!  I have referred them to a few of my friends who have had the same experience.

We have boarded both dogs with them and they always come home happy and without any trauma. One of my dogs threw up a lego minifigure while boarding (two little boys!) and they called me and let me know it happened and they will keep an eye on her, but it didn’t not ruin our vacation and she was fine. I always know our fur babies will be well taken care of and loved there.

More recently we have visited after the corona crisis started and they made it so easy for us to do a minimal contact valet drop off of our dog for vaccinations. The Dr. even came out to speak at the car with a mask from at least 6ft away.

I’m so happy with their service and would recommend anyone give them a try! You won’t be disappointed.<//review><Rating>5< /Rating><date>1590111005491</date><Resp>None</Resp><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< userid>

<text>Wow ! Amazing care from
The moment they came to my car to take my little baby  , Checha to the moment they walked him out to my car , his tail wagging and he was all smiles . I was frequently updated on his status. The initial estimate was spot on with the costs . I want to thank Dr. kooper and Chrissy for the excellent care they provided for my baby checha. They really made me feel at ease and confidence that he was in good hands. His calm and happy  demeanor when I picked him up validated the outstanding care he received. Thank you again to the staff at banderas animal hospital. Even though I don’t leave local it’s worth the drive for the 5 start treatment and expertise.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<text>Outstanding pet hospital.  All I can say is 100% trust,care,compassion  and peace of mind. Being in the vet field 30 years and a recently retired RVT I have only taking my babies to my place of work. I wouldn't never trust just any place with my pets. Dr. Jenna Cooper is amazing, having have actually worked with her in the past. My older baby was having dental issues and his appetite was slightly down.  From the moment I called spoked to Chrissy and my apologies another client care specialist ( I forgot her name.) They were so wonderful and patient.  From the phone call, to the emails and the care my baby alphie received once  I arrived was beyond outstanding.   The service was fast and the technician that came out to get alphie  he was so kind and compassionate.  Once alphie was ready to go home I could not even tell he had lab work done.  A pet peeve of mine being in this field is the alcohol that gets placed on the pets before blood draws. Well alphie had no bruising, no bandage needed and no alcohol smell whatsoever.  I love this hospital. The Vet and her staff are just absolutely amazing. Dr. Cooper is truly one of the most caring and  compassionate  veterinarians I have ever met/worked with in my 30 years. Thank you Banderas pet hospital. 💜< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<review>We were treated quickly and helped within a few minutes. Dr. Cooper was friendly and listened to our concerns about our cat (Sunny). She was helpful with our previous issues with another vet and planned a treatment relating to the results of a blood workup. We are currently
trying to get the food she recommended. If you are looking for a vet for your pet, I would highly recommend you try out Dr. Cooper at Banderas Pet Hospital and Boarding.<//review><rating>5< /rating><name>John Park< /name></record>

Dr Cooper is both very thorough  and asked all the right questions during the exam and provided thoughtful solutions to my dog's issues. In addition the office manager Allie extremely nice, smart and thoughtful in making sure my dog was comfortable with a little mat and some water while we waited for Dr. Cooper. Unlike the other two places I checked out this facility was sparkling clean. They really understand the meaning of customer satisfaction. One would be crazy not to come here.</Text>< name>

I had a semi-emergency situation this morning. My dog Dakota woke up and started projectile vomiting and diarrhea all over the house, with no new changes to his diet, this never occurring before and him being a puppy still, I was that usual worried dog mom and called them and let them know the situation. They got me in within an hour. Dakota loved everyone there and he is normally very shy & protective of me. He did not bark or growl at all, not once. Dr. Cooper was so nice and quick to make her discovery. Dakota has separation anxiety and tends to chew on fabric when we are not home, he must have gotten a hold of something the last few days because one of his intestines did not look normal but it was not so bad that he needed emergency surgery. Thank goodness!!! We are monitoring the situation at home and hope the fabric passes.
Thank you Banderas Pet Hospital and Dr. Cooper,  I am so thankful for your help and making him feel better. My fur baby is my everything, you all are angels on earth.

Thanks again
Ashley & Dakota <3< /review>

We have three 'pet kids', all of whom are getting older.  We have had procedures and routine services throughout the years.  We have always been extremely pleased with the quality of care.  So many Veterinarians have such large operations you feel warehoused.  Not so with these fine people.  We also travel extensively and I never worry that our 'babies' are lonely or bored.

I have been taking my dog here for about 4 years and have nothing but good things to say.  Luckily I have not had any major health problem with my dog, but the routine care and the boarding has been wonderful. The staff loves to see my dog and my dog loves to see them.  Thanks to Dr. Eberheart and now Dr. Cooper for past and continued wonderful service.< /Review>

<Review>We have been going to Banderas Pet Hospital & Boarding in Rancho Santa Margarita since getting our new puppy several months ago. My wife just exclaimed last night, while passing another pet hospital in the area, "I think you did a great job in selecting Dr. Cooper and her team." The staff is extremely professional and caring and we could not be anymore pleased. Each person we have interacted with treats our little Labradoodle as if she were are part of their own family.  If you are looking for a veternarian for your pet, look no further. You will not be disappointed.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80dcebbd6cd395ed:0x502c611a31bffefa</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>BPH takes great care of my two little fur babies.  For the most part, my little ones are healthy.  But, when they need to see the doc, I know they are in good hands.  I travel for work and have to board them periodically.  My doggies love it there.  The staff are all caring and gentle with them.  Dr. Cooper is great.  My extended family also takes their pets to BPH.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

The staff at Banderas Pet Hospital is the best.  Always courteous and friendly.  I bring my dog there for vet services, boarding, day care, and even his bath.  I am always comfortable leaving him with them when I am on vacation.  My dog is always very excited to visit.  Dr. Eberhardt is very experienced.  You can't go wrong to bring your animals here.<//text>

I initially went to a local pet hospital but was closed on a Saturday. Thankfully, I found signs on my way home that guided me to a new pet hospital closer to my home. Since I arrived, the receptionist was very nice and explained their services very thoroughly. I loved how knowledgeable they were and how nice they treated my kitten. I give them an A+ for their service and kindness.< /Review>

<Text>Banderas Pet Hospital and Boarding was simply a delight. We used to board our dog at another facility and making the switch was the best decision possible. At Banderas Pet Hospital, all staff members are wonderful and upbeat and throughout our dogs stay she was constantly being pampered and loved. We thoroughly enjoyed their service and will surely return again and refer their services.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

My boy, Mystic, had been having severe diarrhea all the time.  I had been taking him to my PREVIOUS vet for months with absolutely no results.  Mystic got worse.  I called around for a new vet & ended up speaking with Tony at Banderas Pet Hospital.  Due to her love of pets & the time she spent with me on the phone, I made a appointment.  Dr. E soon discovered, after a couple of tests, urine & blood, that Mystic had an infection that could be fatal to dogs.

Needless to say, Mystic is now in perfect health & gaining weight.  Dr. E saved my dogs life!!!  I highly recommend this outstanding vet & his entire staff for the care of your pet.  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!< /Text>

<text>Our beloved & trusted Vet of 20 years retired, and suddenly I was scrambling for a new Vet. After several disappointing attempts to find a good fit, I found Banderas Pet Hospital. Dr Eberhardt is truly an animal lover & his care & demeanor with our dogs reflects that. But the office staff is very important to me also & I love Toni, Ali & the full staff. Ali is the only tech that our Molly will let trim her nails & other Vets staff requested I sedate her for nail trimming! But Molly loves Ali! She actually pulls me to the door, runs off with Ali & trustingly lets her trim her nails! That alone is worth my trust! And Toni & Ali remember who we are when I have to call.  Also, Dr Eberhardt has his personal cell phone # on his after hours phone message for emergencies & he has a Pet Ambulance !! I've found our new Vet.<//text>< pictures>

<review>Dr. Cooper and the staff at Banderas Pet Hospital were absolutely wonderful! This was our first visit to the hospital and it was a visit I was terribly nervous about. A couple years ago, our family lost our 11-yr old furry family member after a long, difficult fight with cancer. While our veterinarian at the time went above and beyond what we could have expected to help our mutt, we felt that perhaps the treatments/surgeries recommended to us toward the end may have been too extreme (that they may have been in over their heads so-to-speak).

As such, after recently finding a mass on our 5-yr old hound, you can imagine how upset and worried we were. I looked at the reviews for many vets around South Orange County, including any references to people dealing with something similar to what we went through with our last dog, and Banderas Pet Hospital seemed like a good option.

The moment we walked in the front door, we felt right at home. The front office staff was extremely friendly to me and kind/loving to our hound. The waiting room was very clean with treats and water for pets and coffee, water and candy for pet-parents. We were taken into the room quickly, the technician was great with our dog (offering treats and loving on and complimenting our boy:)), and we didn't wait long for the doctor. When Dr. Cooper came into the room, she offered our boy a different kind of treat (he didn't like the first one the tech offered him) and proceeded to love on him and listen to my concerns at length. Due to my previous experience with masses/cancer, I was somewhat emotional and worried, but Dr. Cooper was patient and listened to all I had to say. She thoroughly examined our boy and said the mass didn't feel like it would be cancerous but she would take a quick needle sample and review it right then and there. They took a sample and reviewed it in a matter of minutes and Dr. Cooper told us it looked to be a fatty tumor (according to the sample under the microscope, there were no abnormal cells) and told us to keep an eye on it and let her know if the mass grew at a quick pace or if we noticed anything else out of the ordinary. She did not try to up-sell us on anything (i.e. tell us we should send it to the lab just to be safe, we should run more tests, etc.) Basically, if the mass grew at a worrisome pace or changed composition (i.e. changed shape, became more solid, etc.) to bring him back and they'd run more tests at that time.

Basically, Dr. Cooper seemed to understand that, with all we had gone through with our last dog, we weren't eager to put our current dog through a mess of testing/surgeries/etc. Also, it is important to mention that cost was not a primary concern for us (we have pet insurance for things like this), but it was nice not to be pushed to buy unnecessary services. As we were leaving, the tech and receptionist continued to compliment and love our boy up and checked us out in a timely fashion. I couldn't be happier with their service.< /review>< pictures>

I brought in our dog for the 1st time to Banderas Pet Hospital and Boarding this past weekend. We were promptly greeted and received assistance in filling out the forms to register Indy.  The staff took care of Indy and he came out after the exam smiling.  The staff offered Indy a treat and myself some water. Great service (especially on a Saturday), very convenient location and great prices.<//text>

My puppy Stella has been going here since she was a baby. We LOve Dr. Eberhardt. kind, knowledgeable  and very good with the animals.
WE also love the Staff .. Tony and Ali the best. Stella loves to come for day visits. She will practically break down the door to get in...great when your dog LOves to go to the vet.
We highly recommend Banderas Pet Hospital & Boarding</Text>

We followed Dr. Steenis from another Veterinary clinic in the RSM area.  He takes the time to explain everything that is going on with your pet and all your choices for treatment.  The staff is very welcoming and friendly.  I feel my pet is getting the best care possible with Dr. Steenis and his staff!</Text>

<user>110004297957729428084< /user><Text>Dr. Eberhardt, I thank you for your wonderful veterinary care of our dog.  A few days before Christmas 2013, we brought in, Nina, our almost 12 year old female husky,  as an emergency; she was crying out in pain.  After a evaluation by Dr. Eberhardt . and several tests, he confirmed that there was a tumor on her spleen.  After 2 hour surgery, the tumor along with the spleen were removed and our beloved Nina made a full recovery; otherwise she would have died from internal bleeding.  We really appreciate the assistance from Dr. Eberhardt and all the staff at the hospital, providing Nina the most complete pet care available with love.  We didn't see that genuine care and love in others vets in the past.  Now we know that we don't have to worry when we have to leave our dog for medical attention in Banderas Pet Hospital.  Dr. Eberhardt makes every effort to calm our fears while treating our pet in a gentle and very professional manner.  Thank you so much for saving Nina's life.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80dcebbd6cd395ed:0x502c611a31bffefa</gmap_id>< date>

Dr Eberhardt and his entire staff have provided absolutely the greatest care to our 2 Labrador retrievers, Grace and Jeff.  Grace is now nearly 13 and 2 years ago she developed a cancerous tumor.  Dr. Eberhardt successfully removed the tumor and his thoroughness in her examinations gave her a successful recovery.  She is cancer free and alive today thanks to Dr. Eberhardt.  Toni and Allie have been wonderful too.  Every time we go in, the entire staff provides such a wonderful caring environment.  We are GRATEFUL for their excellent care for Grace and Jeff. If we could give 100 stars we would!  Sincerely, Judy and John Ebbe</text>

Dr. Eberhardt and his wonderful staffs have been taking care of our dog since he was a four months old puppy and we are very happy with all of his puppy and adult dog health program treatments.  We especially like the new ePet Health portal that Banderas Pet Hospital has provide so we can check our dog heath history on line.</review>

This last time the nail tech cut the nails before removing the gel on my nails, got gel back on nails and already peeled off in 5 days. Product horrible.

I went with my friend. We both got the exact same thing and got started at the exact same time. My friend got done over 30 minutes before me. First, the lady doing mine didn't properly stick the fake nail on, and instead of fixing it, she would hold it down while filing it...until it just popped off, so she redid it. Then, she kept making me bleed while she used the drill and filed. She got some blue antiseptic liquid and let the applicator part of the bottle actually touch my blood. At the end, she used something for cuticles that is ROLL ON. Yes, she rolled right over my bloody fingers, and I'm sure she used it just the way it was for the next person. As if that wasn't bad enough, the nail polish is way too thick and, 9 hours later, one of them is bubbly. And it was expensive to boot.
Tldr: It took forever. I got cut a lot. They have extremely unsanitary practices, and the end result of my nails is less than satisfactory.<//text>

Didn't know what they were doing.  I had dip powder nails.  They didn't know how to take it off. I told her it was the same way as Gel.  Of course she didn't listen,  instead they just chatted back and forth in vietnamese. She just kept filing my nails. They kept coming over and looking.  One of the girls got up while giving a lady a pedicure and started touching my hands. It was disgusting.  They need to be reported to consumer affairs. All she did was remove the powder and charged me$25!!. Fills are$50. Definitely will never go back their!<//review>

<Review>Their products are horrible . I went in and got a fill, last week ,and the manicurist insisted that I got gel . I did not want gel . She charged me for gel, and I didn’t get gel . $33 for a fill !? AND not to mention, my right hands nails are ALREADY lifting . She did NOT put the primer on my nail bed after the dehydrator . I am a licensed cosmo . the way she did it, was incorrect .
Now, I can not call in and ask her to fix it because it is closed due to the virus .
What do I do !? I deserve to have my nails last and to look pretty decent for the price I paid, for a FILL .</Review>< Pics>

I went to this place because my car's getting work on it so I walked A few blocks away from home to get my toes and fingers done and I wasn't happy with how they took my old set of Nails off and made my nail bed bleed and sting and the nails they did put on were bubbly and chunky and I had to pay $60.00's for A bad job. I am glad that my car is coming back to me so I can get up to the Victorville mall and go to Lee's nails.. the best.. 5 stars. Plus.<//Review>

Very very very Rude. They told me my feet look horrible. Shop is big but always empty. I see why now. I'm male and asked for my toe nails to be cut short and callus removal and they said no. What kinda business is that? I'm on my feet for a living so a pedicure is soothing but didn't happen the way I wanted<//Review>

Ask the price before you go here . Not worth what they charged. Oh and  callus remover an extra $15

If i could give zero star, I would.  People are so unfriendly the moment you walk in. They need to get some basic etiquette/manner training. They don’t know how to serve their customers.  I tried  this salon several years ago and their service was horrible. I thought I give it a try again this weekend and went back hoping their service might have improved. No surprise! It was the same unpleasant experience. Basically, people are rude and the sevice sucks!
I had gel mani. They cut and file my nails too short and the gel is too thick. Even though they weren’t busy, the person who did my nail was rushing and took a short cut. She pulled off the old gel with a twizer instead of scraping it off gently. I told her it’ll damage my nails but she insisted it wouldn’t.
I totally understand why people gave one star.< /text>

<Review>My pedicure was good, but manicure was not good. The lady cut my pinky, left bubbles and fuzz in the polish. Also took forever because she kept messing up. After all that, I paid an extra $15. I asked/received the $32 mani pedi and then got charged $47. Not sure how that makes sense.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

I loved it I've gone here for manis and loved it so today I went for mani pedi it was busy but they sat me as soon as there was an open spot and then the lady I had was amazing. I have sensitive feet when they get filed down and she was gentle on my feet I loved when she did my hands too. There was people of all ages and they very nice to all.<//review>

I went in yelp about a week and half ago. I read the reviews about this place and decided to skip it and go to another local salon.(lex something 9) Which i was greatly disappointed. It took close to 3 hours complete a medi/pedi. My gel nails bubbled and lifted  and it was so lumpy!!! in the first week. Needless to say i needed to have my nails done again. So i decided to give this place a try.... I really liked this place. It was clean the people were nice and talked to you. I'm very happy with this place.< /review>

<Review>If they had the option to rate a zero I would.. This place is horrible I got a mani pedi my nails were cut so short they hurt. I had rhinestones put on and, before I got home they started to fall off.. I went back the next day, and no more than two hours later they fell off again.. I would not recommend going to this place.. By far it is the worse nail shop I have ever been to.</Review>< rating>

$64 for pedi and mani for mom.  They charge $15 for gel for nails and $15 for gel on toes. I told them other salons charge five dollars more and they give you a look as if they really don’t care. They’re not very happy and the service is mediocre   There is a lot of workers but only three customers on a Sunday  early afternoon. I don’t know how they stay in business</Text>

Got a pedi/mani today because I was to tired to do it myself like i normally do...finished product was sloppy. Nails were not filed straight & nail polish had ridges where he didn't polish the whole nail in every coat...I have a wedding tomorrow and needed my nails to look nice. Should have done them myself...TERRIBLE! Will never go there again!<//text>

$30 for a gel manicure.... the gel peeled off after about 4 days. The manicure was done quickly, almost as if it was rushed and did not look neatly done. Bad experience.< /review>

My pedi was perfect. The tech took her time and did an amazing job. My gel mani was okay...the tech was very nice but she rushed to another customer. A little pricey but overall a good experience. Next time I'm requesting the pedi tech to do both mani and pedi :)< /Text>

This place blows. I am 6 months pregnant. My friend and I decided to try this place out after getting coffee and we both wanted a mani/pedi. I purchased the basic mani/pedi for $29 and she got a gel mani and regular pedi for $44..
FIRST it was a huge language barrier.... then they sit us apart and she doesnt even get seated in a spa chair for the mani/pedi combo. I told them please give her a seat like mine in the pedi spa chair.. They did.
THEN they did the laziest job on my hands and painted my nails like crap. I had the guy redo the polish.
The lady doing my feet said i must never have gotten a pedicure before. She said that because I asked if they massage the feet too. She got grouchy... and the massage was like walking on peeled hard boiled eggs..
Everything sucked and my friends gel nails did not turn out very good.<//text>

The chicken cilantro soup is my go-to when I want something light. Full of white chicken breast, vegetables, & rice. Typically it has zucchini, but there wasn’t any this time.</text>

Just was skeptical to not see any Mexicans making the dishes so wasn't sure how it was gonna taste just from expecting flavors from my same origin but was good. Granda hills doesn't have many Mexican owned or run businesses by Mexican the downfall for Mexican food in certain areas of granada hills.</Text>< Pics>

I love this restaurant! They prepare sensational dishes, their menu is rich, The chief cook in that restaurant is a real authority in the kitchen, I like very much tasting all their dishes. The dishes are consistently good, the service towards the visitors  is agreeable. I  go often to this restaurant and I not even once was disappointed. I recommend it to all.<//Text>

< Review>
This is the best Mexican food in Granada Hills, Northridge, Reseda, Tarzana, basically within 50 miles.  The food is freshly cooked and always amazing.  The salsa is the real goldmine here, it is spicy, hot (but low impact tongue burn for the thick red sauce, which is the BEST) but probably the best tasting and most satisfying salsa I have had!!!   Beef crispy tacos and steak quesadillas are great but our all time favorite is the chicken/rice/cheese (only) burrito. It is a monster and oh so yummy.< /Review>

I had to go back for a change, it was a waste of time and the meat was very old and salty. I will never return to that place. What does a Chinese preparing Mexican food?</Review>< Pics>

This is a spot I used to frequent quite often recently I stopped in after  ordering my food over the phone there was I had no problem they took my order and I paid for it when I arrived. today I was told that I would have to pay for my order before they would even take the order and I'd let them know I only have cash she said sorry we cannot do your order< /Text>

I am a great food critical. I love to try different places and this particular Mexican place here, is just a hole in the wall but, I have NEVER had a taste of Mexican food that can be compared to what their cook, more of a CHEF to me, can do for simple dishes.
I lived in the area for a short awhile and even though, after I moved (35 miles away...) I still come here once in awhile. If you are reading this, and have a chance, pls stop by and try their delicious Mexican food by their  amazing cook, or I should say; chef.

Thank you CHEF!<//Review>

Excellent chicken cilantro soup! must try! I like the crispy chicken tacos too, yummy cheese, fresh lettuce, & tomatoes...plus the salsa bar with grilled pepper & onion, delicious!! Two cooks & a cashier, service not that fast but worth the little wait. Nice portion & fresh authentic food, you can't beat it. My husband and I are fans :D Happy Eating!<//Review>

<review>Horrible customer service! Never order again.  They messed up my order and when I called had a handled it very unprofessionally.  I will never go again.  Food is ok but not worth the poor customer service I received.  Spent a tremendous amount of money< /review>< Pictures>

<review>Their crispy shredded beef tacos are packed full of meat more than any other Mexican restaurant I've been to. Parking is a bit of a hassle and they have too many signs hanging up with all their pet peeves they want you to be aware of but other than that, the food is pretty decent and the prices are reasonable for what you get. I'll definitely come back for the crispy beef taco 🌮.</review>< Pics>

Hate to say it. Really do but the greasiest carne Asada taco I have ever had in my life. I live five minutes from here so I took the second one back where they just returned my money the grease was so bad and I’ve eaten here for literally seven years and showed them the taco asked if they would eat it and the cashier simply said no. Didn’t even offer to make it over was just fine on returning my money. Sad for a place I love to go. I did get some carne asada tacos from rods tacos across the street and they were great except no cheese?<//text>

They always have good fresh food and the taste is always the same.
The service is excellent and they have a promotion going on which is an excellent deal!!
This only goes on during February and if you buy $25 of more carry out order, then you get a free 2Liter soda. Like always this place is my favorite!!<//Review>

Where do I begin. I grew up here and never knew about this place. It's a hole in the wall that I just stumbled upon. The fish tacos and friendly staff keep me coming back. Will not have fish tacos any other way!!! I make it a point to get my tacos anytime I'm in the area. Best fish tacos ever!</Text>

Food is EXCELLENT.

The owner (an Asian lady) is wonderful...

the other women (a slightly heavy set Latina)

is NOT (the main reason why deducted 1-star from this review.)

The hard shell chicken tacos are BOMB! They taste homemade...

...the menudo, better than the Juanita's can bought at Von's or Ralph's or any other local Mexican restaurant.

...the carne asada TASTE like carne asada, not some beef flank.

...and the torta, WOW. Talk about HUGE. Well worth the price.

If you're hungry for AUTHENTIC Mexican food at a fairly decent price (the food can be a bit pricey from time to time depending on what you order)

give this place a chance.  You'll be pleasantly surprised. 😁</review>

< Review>
This is the best place to get Mexican food in the valley.   We have been going there since they opened.  All of the staff are always friendly,  and willing to customize my food to fit my dietary needs.  The food is authentic and not super salty.  Their green tomatillo salsa is AMAZING.   The portions are generous,  cooked to perfection, and their prices are way reasonable.   The place is a little hole in the wall,  that does have a walk up ordering counter and several tables to dine in. This restaurant is definitely worth driving all the way across the valley when we have a craving for mexican food.  Be ready to wait a few minutes, if they are busy.  They have a small staff, and cook all of the food to order.< /Review>

< review>
this is one of the best Mexican restaurants that serve cheap and good quality products, they deserve more than 5 stars. I recommend this more than any other Mexican place, rio Grande is good too but nothing compares to Hot Chile< /review>

< Review>
The cashier woman was very rude and had horrible service. She made mad and nasty faces and made us feel very uncomfortable. She gave us a bad attitude just because we confirmed our order. Business can't go well if only the food is good, the service needs to be good as well. I am never eating there again, and will make sure to tell family and friends to not got there anymore :(<//Review>

Left my wallet in the restroom and manager said their cameras didn't capture who went in the restroom after me.. Then, my wallet was gone. So either and employee kept it or her. Never did any manager refuse to efficiently run the cameras back to verify. She was absolutely no help, even then they treated me like I'm the one who stole something. Very very unprofessional, uncompassionate and little to no effort type of professional ethical values.< /review>

Imagine going to grab a pair of leggings, and finding out that instead of just walking up and grabbing what you need, you have to dig through a nightmare of clothing. I’ve never seen an old navy in such awful condition!

To top it all off, two employees stood behind the counter were gossiping (loudly) while completely ignoring the fact that there was a line. I don’t typically post negative, petty reviews like this but I was really disappointed in the whole place. I get that it’s an old navy, not a Tiffany’s, but good grief.< /Text>

The staff was polite, cheerful, and attentive. They were very helpful to help me find exactly what I needed. The Young man at the register was very pleasant and efficient. I had a excellent experience.< /text>

<Review>On Friday 08/02/19 was the last time I will shop at Old Navy. The place was a dump. At the check out line there was a broken bottle of fragrance on the floor, I notified one of the cashiers and she acknowledged me and continued working the register. There were 4 women working the registers. 10 minutes later and the broken glass was still on the floor.  Doesn't the safety of the customers take priority?<//Review>< Pictures>

With back to school shopping the store was a mess. People don't put things back where they found them and the workers can't keep up on the cleaning. Some price signs were missing so it was hard to tell what was on sale or not. The lines moved fast and the selection was good.</Review>

Brenda was very helpful.  The stores fairly large but a little messy. But I do understand because I work retail. Found what we needed & wait in line wasn't bad.<//Review>

Waited 20 minutes in line and didn't move. Two cahiers one left and no replacement although I saw at least 3 other employees putting stock away. The one cashier was qorking hard, she called for help and manager came but couldn't use register  Dropped my stuff and placed a verbal complaint and all shed say is "we're short staff" when I left 6 people in line and no one had moved.< /Text>

disorganized, not lot of variety of woman s clothes not compare to the Fresno Old Navy store. Disappointed with this store. also the reward money has an expiration day, it sucks. Way get reward money when they give you a time limit. TJMax give you reward money without expiration day to use when you can. not hard to decide where to shop. Sorry old Navy.<//text>

< review>
I went to Old Navy today to return an item and I saw jeans for $10!! I didn't walk around because they were right by the line ... I thought yaaay, score!!!!
While in line in front of me a young lady was telling Michael "manager" that the price was incorrect. So he goes and checks it out and honors the price... Great!
My turn... Both the pants I picked (off the $10 rack) were not $10. Mind you, there was more than one of the same kind I picked on the rack, but different sizes!!
I proceed to tell Kathryn, the young lady helping me that they should honor the price because they were on the $10 rack!
Well, Michael "manager" said no. It really bummed me out! Why did he honor the young ladies items but not mine!?
I feel that was very unfair and I will be contacting corporate. I run a store, and I would rather honor a $5 price difference than loss $10 and a customer.
Michael is not a very good manager.<//review>

Trash, food, in shells, clothes mixed up with other clothes, not to mention sizes.

<text>By far the best açaí bowls ever!  A little on the pricey side but everything is made freshly and the toppings you choose are cut up fresh.  Not to sweet not to bitter.  Just the right amount of goodness put into them.  They are a big hit with the kids as well.  Healthy gone right.  Definitely recommend this place!! As of now you have to call in your order by phone and pick up only.  It’s so Delicious it’s definitely worth the wait!  Yummy😋< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgiACJSn_kqcgGrlw5UhQSrZ_A0TLppdFszchD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJCSP_L_s4huJsi7poDkQFM8GVY8gJ0gkypIwd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< resp>

Good açaí bowl but the location itself isn’t so nice. Inside seems a little disorganized and it is extremely loud with their blenders running. Would be better to come here and take it to go.< /text>

LOVE this place, I first visited quite a few years ago and haven't been back up until about a month ago when I was craving an Acai bowl. This is the closest and most convenient location near home. Parking lot is small and may be packed during peak times since it's shared with several other dining businesses.

I love to order the guarana bowl in the small size (24oz) or the large size (32oz) if I'm particularly hungry. Small bowl some with one topping of choice, bananas, granola, honey. Large size comes with two toppings of choice and every else that's standard with small size. I like how everything pairs well together and are all the right proportions. The Blends are fruity and not icy as all as they don't dilute it with ice.

Prices are fair for what you get, just be aware that Acai bowls run on the pricey side in general - a little under or over $10 depending on what you get and what size.

Wait time for bowl to be ready sometimes takes awhile, so be prepared to wait if it's particularly busy.<//Review>

Don't expect great service here but the acai bowls are amazing. They don't use milk (cashew, almond, hemp) in their base like most places. I get the tropical flavor because it's nice and fruity. The place is packed during lunch time though.<//review>

Delicious acai bowls. I just wish they included more toppings with the small size (which is really a medium size). I would love to add blueberries, but not for another whole $1.</Review>

< Review>
we atleast order once a week because the acai itself tastes great. When i ordered a small tropical mango i barely got any mango. compared to other trips, they didnt fill up the bowl to its maximum capacity. the way they make the acai bowls are inconsistent. also the staffs have a bad attitude towards their customers.</Review>

Lots of choices. They have both acai and pitaya bowls available with fresh fruits.
Reasonable pricing as well.</Text>< username>

<Review>It takes awhile to get your smoothie even though you're the only one there. They talk to each other a lot and can't multi task. When I go I have to make sure I have plenty of time to get my order. They are delicious but they aren't very welcoming or customer friendly. Yet I keep going back. :)< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I love the bowls here. My favorites are the peanut butter chocolate or chocolate.  The small is a big portion.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is once my smoothie tasted like soap or something used to clean.   I'm assuming it was residue on a blender or something like that. I was already at work so I couldn't ask to have it remade.  Not a big deal to me, it hasn't happened again...at least we know it's clean.</text>

Whenever I go to an acai bowl place, it's a hit or miss. Mostly because the bowls are too big for me to finish or that it's too sweet. But when I walked into Beach Bowls, I was happy to see a large menu with a mini bowl option.
So I went with a mini bowl which has a base of acai, banana, honey and granola but I added vanilla power ( has 18g protein) and mangos.
Upon receiving the bowl, I devoured it and it was delicious. It was fruity and fresh. I wish they had coconut shavings but that's about it. I don't have
a photo mainly because I was hungry and it was hot and I really wanted to eat the thing.
So if you want an acai bowl, go here.< /Text>

If you are not familiar with Acai, it may be challenging. I was recommended by co-worker and visited several times. You can choose topping as well. I like the taste itself, but sometimes it is too cold for me. And Acai's tastes is good, but it has small seeds as well, so I didn't fit to texture.< /text>

First time trying it out. The menu has so many different things you can choose fruit or other items. I had the acai bowl. It's larger than I imagined so i wasn't able to finish it. Might be good amount for two depending if you like to share.  There is a lot of parking available and they open early too<//Text>

<Review>I NORMALLY LOVE GETTING MY ACAI BOWLS FROM THEIR LOCATIONS BECAUSE THEY ARE NORMALLY PREPARED WELL AND THE FRUITS AND TOPPINGS ALWAYS SEEM FRESH AND PLENTIFUL. HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES TO PREPARE A BOWL I HAVE BEEN CALLING IN MY ORDER. TODAY THOUGH...WAS RIDICULOUS! I CALLED IN A MINI BOWL NO GRANOLA ADDED TOPPINGS ALMOND, PINEAPPLE, BLUEBERRIES AND GOJI BERRIES...TO BE INCLUDED ALONG WITH THE USUAL BANANA'S AND HONEY. I PICKED UP MY BOWL OPENED THE BAG AND CUP TO FIND NO PINEAPPLES!!! MIND YOU I HAVE ALREADY BEEN CHARGED $9 FOR THIS MINI BOWL. I GO BACK IN THEY CHARGE ME AN EXTRA $1.25 FOR THE PINEAPPLE TO BE ADDED AS SHE FORGOT. I HEAD BACK TO WORK TO NOTICE THE BANANAS AND HONEY WERE ALSO MISSING...I JUST THOUGHT THEY WERE BURIED UNDER THE BLUEBERRIES...BUT NO!!!! THIS LOCATION HAS A LOT OF YOUNG LADIES CHATTING IT UP BUT ABSOLUTELY NO QUALITY CONTROL. I CALLED THIS ORDER IN TO AVOID ANY ISSUES AND A 30-45 MIN WAIT BY ORDERING IN PERSON... IT LOOKS LIKE I NEED TO JUST MAKE MY OWN OR FIND A BETTER ACAI BOWL CAFE. $10 MINI BOWL MISSING THE HEART OF IT'S COMPONENTS IS WASTED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT!!! SUPPORT A BUSINESS WHO CARES ABOUT CUSTOMER SATISFACTION NOT THIS PLACE!</Review>< gmapID>

<review>Fruit selection is great. Staff is super friendly, flavors are complimentary, but I like more junk (toppings) in my bowls. There's not enough crunch in my bowl for me to give it a 5. I'm left with a soupy mess at the bottom.< /review>< pics>

They make great acai bowls if they get the order correct.  Have been
there many times and each time something is missing or it hasn't been
made exactly like the order was placed.
They are rude when you question them about how it was ordered.  I
thought the customer is always correct, especially when I have the
receipt of what we want in the bowls.</Review>

My experience @beachbowls Acai cafe was absolutely yummy! Call your order ahead to avoid waiting longer than you want to wait, otherwise, they are pretty quick. The bananas and strawberries are always very fresh. I love the two sizes they offer. Both sizes satisfy me whether I'm super hungry and get the large or whether I just need a small-ish second breakfast with the small. Overall, great place to get a yummy Acai bowl!<//text>

I'm writing the review in the hope that the owner/manager will read this so he/she can fix this problem for their business. The bowl is good but the girls at the register has a very bad attitude. We've been there twice. And both times, they looked so unhappy to be there and talkd to us like they were doing us a favor. They need to be trained to give a proper customer service. In the meantime we are definitely not going back there to give them any more businesses.<//Review>

<Review>This place can get very busy, which wouldn’t necessarily make me leave a poor review. However, they are not good at handling it. I wait about 8 mins on the line to make my order. But after my order I waited over 25 mins for them to make it. I noticed mine might’ve been made around 15 mins, but they never called my name. After they finally called my name, they took out the one that had already been made for over 10 mins. When I asked why she didn’t call my name sooner because it had already been name, she made up some excuse about following number order. So rather than being apologetic for messing up, she made up some excuse. The bowl is good, but not any better than other bowls I’ve had (in fact I’ve had much much better). I just don’t think it’s worth the price, the janky atmosphere, or the long wait times. I have to say that the manager/owner, I’m assuming, was very nice and friendly.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80dd4ac185590e89:0xb0bc1df5728aafcb</Gmap_id>< rating>

<Text>The best donuts around. Great selection, great taste, reasonably priced. I'm a new customer, but intend in being a regular. They also have a refrigeration unit with cold drinks.< /Text>< gmapID>

Great selection, donuts were good. Rude service and the donuts were a bit pricey.< /Review>

<text>USED to be a good place. Donuts and coffee here are always delicious BUT we went this week and the lady was pretty rude, looked annoyed when I grabbed a few EXTREMELY THIN napkins for our donuts, AND there was a tiny roach on our coffee lid.😬 I wish we would've taken a picture. Oh but she was SUPER nice to the guy that bought a BIG box of donuts. I don't think we'll be going back unless we hear they've changed.< /text></record>

I asked my husband to bring me donuts and he told me this place was his favorite and had the best donuts. I'm usually skeptical when it comes to donut shops but I must say these are the BEST donuts ever! The dough alone is just AMAZING! It's soft and moist! We had a chocolate and maple bar. My four year old daughter who usually just eats the frosting/sprinkles off the donut ate half a chocolate bar and LOVED it! I am really impressed with the place and will definitely recommend and come back!not to mention the prices are super good!< /review>

<text>The man behind the counter was very nice and I think he slipped me a couple extra donuts which was cool, but the donuts themselves were not the best. They seemed a little dry and heavy, rather than light, fresh, and fluffy. I tried warming them up in the microwave, which helped a little bit, but overall they still weren't that great. I've had better donuts elsewhere.< /text>< user_id>

I like this donut bakery.  They serve until they run out of donuts that they made the night before.  Always fresh, but that means they can have a variety of closing times.  Never know if they will be open when we get there.< /review>

< Review>
I AM  looking forward to trying their gluten free options.  I went with a friend to celebrate her birthday.  We each had salads.  The sizes are perfect, The staff was friendly and helpful!There are disposable disinfectant cloths on each table so you can wipe the tables down.  The staff does wipe them when people leave.</Review>

<Date>1503001075665<//Date><rate>5< /rate><review>I use to frequently eat here back when I was attending John Muir across the street many years ago. I have passed by several times and thought I need to stop by and see if the food is still great, especially their fries like back in the days. I ordered the club sandwich with fries. The sandwich was great and the fries to my surprise taste just as great as they did when I was in junior high.  It was also fulfilling. I am definitely coming back to eat here.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>Best sandwich I ever had. Chris got a handle of what I liked and recommended the Milanese spicy. Best sandwich I've ever had by a mile. Packed with flavor and everything perfectly paired. Felt like I was eating at a deli in Italy. The nicest owner, freshest quality, and overall best experience. Well done!<//Review>< Time>

I used to work down the street from this one. Used to go A LOT! Miss it. So, I stopped by today to treat family members for lunch, and wooooooowww- the line was down to Lowell Avenue!
Worth the wait though! Great service, very friendly crew. They are busy, and even if they were stressed, they didn't show it. They are super nice and patient.
Our burgers were the best! Did we want fries, yes of course!

If you're in the vicinity, their burgers are goooood. Go for it!<//Text>

Stopped in here before heading to the movies next door. The burgers were very good. The onion rings were perfect. Good pricing and the service was top notch.

They do offer beer and wine as well.

Plan on coming back really soon.

One of the best burger places around! I had the Pacific Blue and the patty was cooked perfectly (medium). The sweet potato fries are yummy. The prices are decent for a place in the city, and in the Fillmore!</Text>

Been going there since I was a teen. Taste is consistent and delicious for a burger joint. Everything is good there, you can't go wrong with anything on there menu. My favs is the pastrami sandwich and their fries.< /review>

<Text>Fred's Burger is the perfect place when you want a gourmet burger with a bunch of toppings for a decent price! I came here with my girl friend for a catch up dinner after work, and I ordered the sunny side burger with beef and a whole grain bun ($9.99). My friend and I also shared the fry-fecta ($6.75), which includes the zucchini onion strings, sweet potato fries, and russet fries.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80c2c825af64af0b:0x569b1d93958d8d30<//Gmap_id></record>

Love this place I have been coming to this place to eat since I was a kid. Seems like a pretty popular place. They have great food and pretty fast service unless its during the time when kids are coming out of school then the restaurant is gets packed. As I said they have great food and the staff is always friendly and they always try to help you in the best way they can. Definitely recommend this place.</Review>

Burgers and the atmosphere at this spot is excellent. Got there near six, it wasn't packed at all. I will probably become a regular. The prices are good for what you get.< /review>

Everytime I come to California I come to Fred's.  The supervisor lalo is very kind and radiated great hospitality. The sauce is the best! These burgers are so good I love coming here when I visit. Staff was very helpful and attentive to my order.
Thank you for the great meal!<//review>

< Review>
I have eaten at this place since I was two years old. My parents have eaten here since before i was born. My grandpa has been eating here since he moved here 40 years ago. Even when I moved to Las Vegas, whenever I would come visit my grandpa we would get Fred's and see it as a delicacy that we eat when we came to visit. If I could eat from any one place for the rest of my life, this would be the place and I do intend to continue eating here until I die or they close, which I know will never happen since thier food is so delicious. Would definitely recommend to anyone and everyone.</Review>

Gotta admit. They got some tasty burgers. Went for the hamburger special with chili cheese fries and everything was hot and ready to go. Burger was big enough to share half. Best burger, hands down.<//Text>

I grew up eating at that restaurant and I live in a whole other city. And still I cant find a place that makes burgers or fries better than they do. The customer service is great and whenever they mess up they always fix it as fast as possible.<//review>

The burgers are always delicious but their French fries astound all the time. The nachos will fill you up to the top and they have a variety of foods and plates to choose from. This is a great place to eat if you want to pig out or for a good cheat meal on your diet.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

They have some really good affordable pastrami sandwiches like under $10 bucks  that's with the drink & fries. Refills are .50 cents on drinks. This establishment is pretty consistent with the quality of their dishes served. But this is my spot for mainly one dish that pastrami sandwich.< /Text>

Freds has been the best burger spot for decades. I've been going here since 1994 when I first attended John Muir Middle School  and still tastes the same 24 years later. After moving back from up North the first thing I wanted was Fred's Fries.<//Text>

< Review>
This is the best burger spot without a doubt! It was so juicy and delicious I got the avocado burger and my hunny got the bbq burger so delicious as well, we decided to get a large garlic fry for both of us, but now i know I can't share my fries with someone else bc they were amazing ! We usually like seasoning our fries with salt and pepper but the garlic fries here didn't need any extra seasoning.< /Review>

Great food period been going there for over 20 years. They're up to date now so they accept cash and Debit cards. Only thing bad i would say is that if you go in and order it may take a while because of the crowd on certain days. Thats just because of great food. Words of advice you can call it in and 15mins later it will be ready.<//Text>

<review>This place is in my neighborhood so I've been eating here since the early 90s. The food is great. The parking is not that great and I wouldn't suggest going in the mornings before the children start school or right after the children get out of school because the place gets packed with rude middle schoolers. This place is directly across from John Muir Middle School.< /review>< Rating>

Awesome food, great service. Can't ask for nothing more. Fries be on point. As a community we can't allow "them" to take it away. They already took away chris burgers on crenshaw. 😢😢< /Review>

I've been there many times to get burgers, pastrami or a breakfast burrito this time I was there to get pastrami  Actually two pastrami sandwiches  1 with fries and a Burger combo and they forgot my French fries with the 1 pastrami sandwich. I also visited recently and I ordered 2 pastrami  & a pattie & egg breakfast burrito. And I got 3 pastrami sandwich. I will only order for my boyfriend for a while not good customer service.</text>

<text>Im 28 years years old and I been coming here since I was in 6th grade back in 1999 in John Muir Middle School,  best burgers and fries always a place to reccomend to others :) only down side it needs a drive thru and accept debit/credit cards and would need more cleanliness, other than that good is amazing :)</text>< pics>
