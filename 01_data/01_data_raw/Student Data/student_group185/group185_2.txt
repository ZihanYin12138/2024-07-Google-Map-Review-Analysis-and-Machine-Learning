They rebuilt my automatic transmission about 17k miles ago, I now bring it in every spring or 10-12k mi for a flush.. I recently had a leak somewhere around the trans, brought it in and they replaced an old rubber hose and pan gasket, refilled it and tested it.. making sure I'm always good to go..
Yes, I refer people here, its all they do everyday all day and they are nice 👌 👍 😊<//Review>

<Time>1606081823700< /Time><rating>1<//rating><text>I just want to share my experience with this shop. Below are a number of reasons why I’m so disappointed with this shop:
1. Inconsistent pricing - they will give an initial quote then will subsequently increase the price.  You have no longer have a choice because they did the tear down of the transmission already.  It would be nice if the pricing is more transparent and upfront.
2. Unprofessional - they would say the car is ready but when you come in to pick up it is not actually done yet.
3. Missing Parts - Just starting to find out that some parts are missing here and there. Tried to ask them about it but did not even bother to look for it or even try to investigate what is missing and offer assistance.

In short, I wish I had gone to a different shop. And oh, the transmission does not shift smoothly. But I don’t want to deal with this shop again even it’s still under warranty.< /text>< Pics>

When it comes to finding a mechanic you can trust is not so easy. I have had a very bad experience with repairing my transmission on another car that I had.  So when I had my transmission problem with this car I was so nervous on who I will take it to, but after finding Trans 1, I can tell you I will take my cars no where else for transmission problems. I worked directly with James He is the most honest, trustworthy mechanic I have ever met. He was friendly and honest from the start, not to mention they are very affordable. I dropped my car off and then ended up having a lot of stuff happen and wasn't able to get my car out right away. I felt terrible for James as he always continued to work with me. He was very understanding of my situation. I am forever greatful for his help!!!! I will recommend this place to everyone! Thank you again James and all Trans1 mechanics!!!<//review>

Worse service ever. Do not trust this place. Do not come here for transmission service. Maybe to buy parts but nothing more than that. I came here to get my transmission fixed. When I came here it seemed okay and they gave me a price to fix it. The price seemed reasonable but they later increased the price because of "some things they found". So I said okay because it was my working van so I needed it. After they fixed it, which took forever, it was only good for about 3 days before the check engine light turned on and went back about 4 times and it still was not fixed. I got tired of complaining and they did not care at all. So I took my van to another shop near my house and he did not change the price or made me waste time like these people did. Please do not go here.<//text>

<Name>Jim Bray< /Name><Time>1560083652830< /Time><rate>1</rate><Text>THIS SHOP IS THE WORST SHOP I HAVE EVER BEEN TO!
Beginning in March 2019 I took my truck in because the transmission was slipping and check engine code was on. I payed 1,350 for total transmission rebuild. However shortly after driving the truck the transmission began to slip again along with check engine light coming back on. I was told I needed a new computer wich I payed 240 for. This still did not resolve the issue. I had to even buy another computer because the one they installed was no good.I have been coming back to the shop over and over to get this issue resolved. I have had to to have my truck towed twice beacause it stalled on me to the point that the whole transmission went out. When it got to the shop I was told that the transmission  had a mechical failure. It was at the shop for another 3 weeks. And I was told to come test drive it. While test driving the truckin with James the transmission continued to fail. They still have not been able to resolve the issue. I asked for a refund and was told to come back the following wed to pick it up. When I called to see if my refund was ready for pick up James acted as if forgot and has continuously stalled.
It is now June and I have been very patient but my only recourse is to go to court and file with better business bureau</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I always call James first to see if he's able to fix whatever the problem is, he's so CLUTCH. I 100,000,000,000 reccomend coming here. Customer service, pricing, and vibes are ALWAYS A1.<//text>

{'time': 1492550892590, 'text': 'This was a 1989 Ford Taurus, classified as a "non operating" vehicle that was sold by the police to the public.  The car was towed to the shop and could not move on its own.  You asked for an estimate before we inspected the car and asked how much it is to drop the transmission and fix one leak and I said $650 to drop the transmission and fix one leak but I told you the amount can go up once we take a look at the car and see the damage.  Once we inspected the car, it was not just a simple leak.  We had to do a lot more repairing and updating to get the car moving.  Once we fixed the car, we could not reach you for 2 months.  We had to storage this car for 2 months until your "lawyer" demanded we give the car back without any balance paid for parts, labor, and storage fees. I tried to work out a deal with you since you said this car was for your son to drive, so I did not charge any storage fees that was accumulated.  Your "lawyer" sent us a demand letter, again saying to give the car back when nothing was paid.  I sent a response letter back stating the balance owed with an explanation. You came back that same day and paid the full balance, which shows our shop has no fault.  I googled your phone number and it leads to Quick Towing and Used Car. You tried to save a few bucks on repair to get the most resale value.  I even saw your car on Compton Blvd with a for sale sign.  We can\'t satisfy all our customers but the ones who are honest all leave satisfied and come back. Hence the good ratings after all these years.'}< /Resp>

<review>The place is decent for the price. This is not the Hilton because this neighborhood is not the Hamptons. Those who come here and complain that this place is old and rickety, complain about pillows not being new, ceiling needing  repairs, outdated furniture, must first explain what brings their first-class sensibilities to a place like Vermont and Florence to begin with.</review><Rate>5< /Rate><Date>1627750934948< /Date>< Name>

Will did a fantastic job keeping me updated as the traffic courts struggled to keep up with Covid regulations and kept pushing our court date. He was patient, professional and super knowledgeable. He was able to get my speeding ticket waived after I wasn't given the opportunity to take the driving school for having an out of state drivers license. Fees were completely reasonable. I would hire Will and his team again in a heart beat.< /text></record>

I cannot recommend this firm enough!

2 speeding tickets one in 2017 and 2019, both times My Traffic Guys.

The professionalism and value of the service is great.

If you value your time this service is worth investing, William's understanding of the court system is incredible.

Great communication and easy payment.

I hope I don't get any tickets in the future but if I do I will contact this office immediately.< /text>

<review>I have never done a review for a company but felt the need to do one for My Traffic Guys. I have used My Traffic Guys twice over the last few years for speeding tickets I received. Mr. Concidine is efficient, organized and communicative, which I appreciate! Both times my ticket was dismissed. I highly recommend My Traffic Guys!! They are the best!< /review></record></dataset><record>

What's better than beating one ticket? Beating two on the same day. I highly recommend the services provided by this company. Prompt response time, on time updates and at least in my case, exactly what I retained their services for. Can't recommend them enough. Thanks again.< /Text>

I lived in San Diego for 4 years and over the course of that I received a few speeding citations as one tends to do when you have the mountains to go drive around in on the weekends. Will and the guys at the office were so helpful and professional. They not only saved my driving record but saved me countless amounts on possible insurance hikes and fines. I would always recommend them for any traffic ticket issue.<//review>

<Review>William is by far one of the most professional people I've had the pleasure to work with. William explained the process in a very understandable way for the average joe to understand. His responses always covered my concerns and put my anxiety regarding my speeding ticket to rest. Moreover, he kept me updated through out the process. I couldn't ask for a better lawyer. I recommend My Traffic guys. They also work on personal injury, bankruptcy, criminal defense, or driving under the influence cases.< /Review>< Pics>

Will was extremely profession, honest and transparent with my case. He ended up saving me hundreds of dollars and a point on my license. Highly recommend to anybody that needs a ticket attorney and will be using him in the future.</Text>

I can't recommend My Traffic Guys (Will) enough. He is very prompt with communication, is professional and kept me up to date within minutes of new regarding my case. He was able to it dismissed and I couldn't be happier. I received a "crossing the street against a flashing red light" violation which was pure and utter BS. Will's fee was $50.00 less than the fine, and he went to court twice for this ticket. Money very well spent and if I ever have any type of traffic violation in the future, I will undoubtedly utilize his services again. Customer service at it's best.< /text>

Living out of state, I hired Will to represent me after receiving a red-light camera violation.  He was upfront about potential outcomes and was very responsive/professional throughout the process.  I would hire him again regardless of outcome.<//Text>

<review>Without going into too much detail, I was pulled over and allegedly clocked at 103mph by CHP.
I immediately called Will/My Traffic Guys and left it in his hands.
As of today (Christmas Eve), I am happy to find out that my case was dismissed. At least one good thing came of 2020, and I have Will to thank.
I’m not saying that I’m going to go out and get another speeding ticket, but if that should happen, My Traffic Guys will be my first and only phone call.</review>< rating>

<Review>Mr. Concidine was very professional since my first phone call with him. He’s very detail oriented and kept me informed every step of the way. To be honest, I was a little concerned about my incident but he handled it very well and my case was dismissed. I genuinely recommend him if you’re looking for a proper lawyer.< /Review><date>1601010605540<//date><Gmap_id>0x80d9535dad14822d:0x860e51773c55c9fd< /Gmap_id><rate>5<//rate>< pics>

<Review>I worked with William M. Concidine and he made my case a very smooth process and I truly appreciate him.  I would give this Law Firm 10 stars if I could.  If you need an attorney for personal injury, bankruptcy, criminal defense, or driving under the influence cases, this is the place to go.  Look no further, and get in touch with them right away.  They respond VERY quickly and are very helpful here.  Will definitely use them again in the future if need be.  :)</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

<name>Nicole C</name><Text>When I first reached out to My traffic guys, They were the third office I called inquiring about traffic ticket help, and I needed representation the next day! Mr. Concidine called me back within minutes and explained the ins and outs of the traffic court system and explained what his office  could do to help us maneuver through it. We signed up with him that night and he was in court the next morning for us. Our court date was set for about 6 weeks later.. I emailed him a few times and responded always thoroughly answering my questions. Fast forward to our hearing date, again he was in court on our behalf. As a working mom with 12 hours days the last thing I need  is a court date, let alone 2! Turns out, the officer who wrote the ticket didn’t show and  our case was dismissed. Well worth the money to have my traffic  guys go to court twice for us.< /Text>< pics>

I remembered I saw one of my friend shared his experience with My Traffic Guys with very satisfied and happy ending. So after one day I felt so innocent to get a speeding ticket, I gave My Traffic Guys a call for help. Will Concidine sounded very professional from the call. He explained all the options and steps I needed to do. Will responded very quickly for any question. He followed me up with updates while I almost forgot such a case.  Will took care of the case and eventually gave me a great news that the ticket was dismissed. I'm very happy and satisfied with My Traffic Guys' services.</review>

Mr. William Concidine and his office has proven to be outstanding by providing frequent updates as well as giving useful insight and information in regards to the citation, leaving me with a great sense of a peace of mind. A friend of mine recommended this office to me and I would like to pay it forward by recommending the My Traffic Guys office to everyone in San Diego.</review></record></dataset><record>

I would highly recommend My Traffic Guys. I contacted them as I received a ticket for not stopping at a red light. They emailed me back right away. Gave me updates on the case as the court date was pushed back. The ticket was dropped which was a huge relief as it was around $500. If you get a traffic ticket send them an email will be worth your time.<//Review>

Words cannot describe how amazing these guys were! For $150 they got me out of over $2500 of tickets and showed up to three court dates because I moved to Chicago and was unable to attend any of them.

Every single person that I know in San Diego, I let them know that these guys because their services or not only top notch, but professional, fast, and so affordable for the amount of value that they bring.

All three of my court dates were spread out over a year and a half, and the $150 covered the cost of them going to all three. Literally the greatest company. Thank you so much. HIGHLY recommend!!!</Text>

William is awesome, my teenage daughter was driving "Allegedly" 90 miles on 78 hwy and got a ticket, he went to the court trial, I don't know how William did it but the ticket was dismissed by the court. I can not thank him enough and recommend him to everybody. Best price, he took his time to explain me everything in details, Thank you William for everything.< /Text>

< review>
I highly recommend My Traffic Guys. I had a traffic ticket and called/emailed multiple lawyers. . Most never even responded. Will Concidine got back with me within minutes of sending an email and had awesome communication from the beginning. He explained every step of the process and answered all questions I had. I had never had to hire a lawyer before so I had a ton of questions..
He ended up getting the case dismissed without me having to pay any additional fines, court fees etc. Their fee is very nominal in comparison to what I would have paid had I not found them.Very professional and fantastic lawyer. Hopefully I won’t need a traffic lawyer again, but if I do.. there’s no doubt I will call these guys again. Thanks for everything! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️<//review>

<Review>Scored myself a nice speeding ticket on the 5 in February 2019.  Did some research on traffic attorneys and gave My Traffic Guys a call.

Will answered the phone and spent 10-15 minutes with me while I explained what happened and asked questions. He was completely transparent, explained the process and did not guarantee an outcome. (Which any attorney or firm that does is lying to you) He did give me his opinion of my odds and I hired him on the spot.

He personally went to both the arraignment and trial and updated me on each within hours. Thanks to Will the ticket was dismissed and I couldn’t be happier with his professionalism and communication.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I would highly recommend this attorney. I hired him for following too closely ticket. He is so much attentive and up to date with calendar. Even he is always ready to help you on phone as well. He managed my  spouse's case really well, that case has trial in beginning of 2016 and hearing was in June 2017. I just got good news that court dismissed the ticket. I love the service they provide and appreciate your help.
I contacted 'My Traffic Guys' after reading review on google and yelp and that proves me so true :) Thank you Mr. William Concidine<//Review>

Thank you Mr. Concidine for representing my wife then me on different occasions. My wife and I got tickets for not doing a complete stop at a stop right turn movement here in Chula Vista by CVPD. On both tickets Attorney Concidine and firm was able to get the ticket dismissed. They kept me informed after the first court date was extended,  then by the second court case our tickets were dismissed. I recommend their services to all my family and friends! You should do the same.<//review>

And his office staff is beyond helpful, we had the first pleasure to speak with Michel his Legal Assistant, what an amazing start with the office-he is knowledgeable helpful, extremely phenomenal with patience to get you started and answer all your questions and his kindness is exceptional ! I knew I was in good hands just after dealing with him. Then I have the opportunity to speak to Mr. William, what a great combination to have on your side to fight for you in criminal traffic court.
Don't hesitate to call Mr William, he is professional, aggressive, fast, fair priced, and very knowledgeable.  If you want one on one personal attention as your case is the only important one-then this is your office! He is very personable too, honest and made us very happy with all his help. We ended up with a possible $1200 ticket for over 100 miles per hour speeding ticket, we walked away with it completely DISMISSED!
WOW,  we are speechless and extremely grateful with the outcome and it's all because we hired the BEST! Thank you and God Bless you Mr. William & Michel!!!</Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

These guys just got my speeding ticket dismissed in North County San Diego!  It was a heavy one too!  Many thanks and much gratitude!  Even before they took my case, they answered all my questions and my phone calls at no charge and were bottom line, no BS, and told me my odds and risks!</Text>

Concidine to represent me in my case of a menial traffic offense in which I was cited for cutting another car off (which I claimed was not true).  William Concidine is a  very calming and professional Attorney.  I was anxious about my case before my hearing in court and he put my fears to rest.   He was very prepared for my case if it were to move forward.  Due to the officer not appearing,  my case was dismissed!!  I feel that if the case were to move forward I would have been well represented.  Thank you William M .Concidine for representing me.   Please know I will refer others to you.< /review>< Response>

<rating>1</rating><text>Writing this review on ​behalf of my husband since he does not have a GOOGLE account. My husband decided to go with My Traffic Guys based on their reviews on Google and Yelp. He paid his $150 as requested to take on his traffic violation on his motorcycle. There was limited communication with my husband and this company. Just feels like the attorney didn't even attempt to fight the ticket at all or listen to any of the concerns with the traffic stop in the first place. There were 3 total mistakes with the ticket and what the officer stated but was still granted in favor of the officer without a fight from the attorney. My husband should have just disputed it himself. Find someone else who will actually care to listen to you, not just take your $150 and move on to the next person. After all, he got paid, ​right?< /text>< pics>

I can't praise attorney William Concidine  and his law firm enough. In 20 years of driving in California I was cited for traffic violations altogether four times, of which three citations were issued in the space of two weeks last year. I was particularly stressed for time with my own caseload and a bit  panicky about that avalanche of  traffic citations. My assistant suggested retaining MyTrafficGuys, and it turned out to be a real blessing. From the moment of our first contact with the firm, they had completely relieved me from all worries and hassle. The office personnel is friendly and efficient, and the attorney's work is expedient and miraculously effective. I highly recommend MyTraffic Guys without a moment's hesitation.  Have I mentioned that all three citations were dismissed? This law office really is the best answer to all your traffic problems.< /Review>

Great location for food and drinks before or after campus events. The owner/chef/management is new fall 2018. The menu selections for individuals or groups is great. Also, it's a comfortable place to dine alone.< /Review>

Not a bad place. Some good craft beers. Prices are average/expensive. Doesn't have any real atmosphere. This place has only just opened though so early days. Staff were nice and convenient to Berkeley campus for a decent beer< /text>

I come here about 2 times a week and the food is absolutely amazing. The beer selection could be a bit bigger. The atmosphere is very modern. If you are looking for a dirty and sweaty bar scene then this place is not for you. Bears Lair is really modern and classy. Has an amazing outdoor patio with fire.< /text>

<text>Nice beer selection. Really tasty food. Service is friendly. Pleasant (if somewhat urban/industrial) environment.

While I liked the decor of the old Bears Lair a bit more, I really like this new version quite a lot.< /text>< Pics>

<Review>The bears lair has pitchers! Came just after reopening a year and a half ago and it has vastly improved. Pitchers are the soul of the Bear's lair and opening manager does an incredible job taking care of people suggesting beers and understanding what people want from an old college hang out.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Great bar, good food and service.
I've been to The Bear's Lair only one. There were students and others. Most tables inside were reserved at Dinner time (on a Thursday), so if you go with a bigger group you should reserve. You can sit inside or outside. I had a very good burger. Service was fast and friendly.<//text>< Time>

Although I have never been to the old Bear's Lair, I'll agree with others that the atmosphere is very sterile and generic. Not my idea of a "campus" bar - more like a bar that happens to be on campus.</Review>< GmapID>

You go for the beer and the atmosphere, not the food.

That said, this place is GREAT for gameday drinking, watching sports after (or while you're supposed to be in) class, and getting a great college bar experience.< /Review>

The polar opposite of what The Bear's Lair used to be... What was once a fun, vibrant college hangout has been turned into a sterile bistro-bar for older patrons.< /Text>

<Text>Why close so early? I have repeatedly tried to go there after a show next door at Zellerbach only to find the doors locked and a disinterested bartender staring at us while wiping up.
The service is nice....but aloof
Ill take my money to Kips or Remys.< /Text>< Pics>

<review>Terrible spot, half the time it's closed for fancy alumni events, it even closes at 8pm on Saturday night. Ridiculous, pretentious and unbecoming of the tradition set by the previous bear's lair. These clowns don't even serve pitchers. What a joke. Go to Pappy's for the real college experience.< /review><Rate>1</Rate><Name>Cee Miselrooy</Name>< pics>

I went here for the first time a few months ago and was surprised to see a place like this on campus. Modern, clean, and overall, a pleasure to go to whether it's for a lunch or a  classier Friday night. Food quality is spot on. Fresh and well-sourced. Service is spot on. Staff are friendly and receptive to feedback.
There's enough cheaper, college student-oriented food in southside that there doesn't need to be another one on this side of campus. Don't be comin' here expectin' that cuz you ain't gettin' that.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

I have had the good fortune to be a customer of Capri for over 20 years. The service, cost, and quality cannot be matched elsewhere. Even after moving from CA to the East Coast 13 years ago, I have continued to reach out to Chris for everything. While there are certainly local jewelers in Connecticut, I don't trust anyone like I do Chris. He's honest, kind, and very patient. You cannot go wrong with Capri!</text>

<time>1619923381023</time><Rating>2< /Rating><review>We first walked by the place and after chatting with them thought they were extremely nice people and knowledgeable jewelers. Decided to have them make a custom sapphire ring from a model we had found online. They did a nice job with the ring and it looked quite like the online piece. However there was one BIG problem. The ring had a semi precious topaz in it instead of a sapphire like we clearly requested in writing multiple times.  They didn’t even want to charge us any less and didn’t seem to appreciate how our trust in them was so damaged. In the end we are in limbo with our $500 deposit and went elsewhere for a ring.<//review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

I bought a tennis bracelet here two years ago. In June I brought it in because it broke. It recently broke in the same place now for the second time.

I went in today and was originally told it would be $300 to repair it the “right way” so it doesn’t continue breaking.  The price later went down to $190 for the repair. The saleswoman said all the prongs needed to be redone. That is a quality issue and I won’t be purchasing anything else from them. I went across the street and had it looked at. The hinges are apparently weak. Go somewhere else unless you don’t mind having your jewelry fall off. Note: I am not overly hard on my jewelry.</Review>

I had a ring made customized through capri jewelry. Haygan was really great and had the ring made so nice and the customer service was  the best. I will recommend this place. And the price is great.<//text>

Came here 6 years ago, then I came back in 2019 and a Lady told me a price of 1300 and then she changed the price to 1500 because she "made a mistake" and "she thought I was paying cash". Don't let you be scammed by her, go with a guy not the lady, she's not honest at all.< /Text>

<text>As a first time buyer of an engagement ring, there was a lot to learn and pressure to make the right choice. Recommended by a friend of ours in LA, we came to Capri Jewelry.

Chris was very informative and helpful! He brought a lot of experience to the table and provided great advice. Not only he found an excellent diamond, he custom-made our engagement ring and wedding band to our specifications. The result was absolutely beautiful!

When the ring needed a minor adjustment, Chris’ after-sale service was excellent and prompt!

I would recommend Chris to anyone who is looking to buy jewelry in the LA area!</text></record></dataset><record>
<text>Chris was an amazing jeweler to work with! The professional staff at .Capri is second to none in LA.  I am very diligent about doing research before making big purchases. I compared the top three best reviewed Jewelers in the area and spent time with all three.  Chris was the third jeweler I met with and I knew in minutes he was the one to trust.  When my wife's new wedding ring was completed it exceeded my expectations.  If you are looking for the best deal in LA from the most ethical jeweler in town, be sure to stop by Capri and see Chris!<//text><rating>5</rating>< GmapID>

<text>We dealt with Chris. We spent days looking at hundreds of rings and were about to go home when we happened on his store. Spent hours talking with him. He was extremely courteous and helpful. He explained everything about how diamonds are classified and priced so we felt educated. We left and tried to prove him wrong but every time we went to other jewelers over the coming days we realized that the information he shared was absolutely accurate. Before you buy any expensive jewelry PLEASE give these guys a call and understand the difference between what is reality and what the other traders wang you to believe. You will be glad you did! This is NOT the ring I chose- we actually had one custom made, for a fraction (20%)of the price of high street jewelry stores and less than his competitors here. The diamond alone ended up saving me $10k over high street prices and I got a better diamond than I would have from the high street.  If I had gone with a different store at the Jewelry quarter I would have paid a little more and not received anything close to the diamond I purchased. BEWARE being blinded by jargon, ratings and certifications etc.. Let Chris guide you. You can trust him to not push you into spending more than you need. He could have easily had me spend a lot more but kept guiding me to less expensive alternatives...< /text><gmapID>0x80c2c7b52f4cade3:0x5e811d67a0b3a3f0< /gmapID>< Resp>

Chris was UNBELIEVABLE!! He helped my fiancé every step of the way and produced the most amazing and unique engagement ring. He’s SO knowledgeable about diamonds, metals, sizes, setting styles, etc. and will not only produce your dream ring as you describe it, he’ll make key suggestions that will only enhance the ring more. His prices for custom pieces are also unbeatable! 10/10 recommend!< /text>

I've known of Capri Jewelry Inc's work for over a year and when it became apparent that a custom setting was in order, his was the first name that came to mind. The ring came out beautifully, on time, and within budget. Check out the photos and be sure to visit Capri Jewelry Inc's shop when you're in the market for an elegant, timeless piece.< /Review>

We got my engagement ring and our platinum wedding bands here. They are beautiful! Rafi is an expert at his craft, and values his customers. Luba is so sweet and very attentive. We are very satisfied with our experience and highly recommend Capri Jewelry Inc's if you want high quality custom-made jewelry.< /review>

I was shopping in downtown looking for a style of chain that would match me and i ended up finding a beautiful rope chain and a cross here. I found exactly what i wanted and the price was cheaper then similar chains i saw at other stores. Puzant was very helpful and his service was great. I will definitely be back to this store!</review>

Capri Jewelry has the greatest service, pricing, and quality out their. As soon as I walk in to the store, they welcome me and offer me a bottle of water. For the great quality of their jewelry, the prices are affordable. Also as soon I sit down they offer to clean my rings for free! And every purchase you make, you they give you free jewelry cleansers. Good customer service, affordable price,good quality! I can't really shop at another jewelry store.</review>

<review>Quality, trustworthy jewelers are about as hard to come by as quality, trustworthy used car dealerships- and that said, I'd buy a used car at Capri Jewelry Inc any day.  Instead, though, I bought a necklace here, and had a vintage Omega men's watch completely rebuilt.  Both experiences were completely fantastic- and the prices for both (especially the watch) were aggressively competitive.  Small, honest businesses like Capri Jewelry Inc are hard to come by- don't miss out on an opportunity to do business here.  You won't regret it.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

We had a great experience here. My fiancée and I had some ideas and with Chris's guidance, we were able to build something we're both really proud of.
We bought a wedding band and engagement ring using a stone that's been in the family for years. We found a nice setting and modified it to our liking, including the satellite diamonds being matched to our stone's color and clarity. It looks great and was less than I anticipated. He even replaced a small stone that had fallen out of my sister in law's ring (she was with us picking up our ring) and she hadn't even purchased from him!

I included a picture of our rings. It is a dark picture with both rings, one on her hand.<//text>

Thse guys (specifically Chris) are amazing. If you are looking for an engagement ring (or jewelry in general), definitely talk to Chris.  He really spends the time educating you about the entire process, diamonds, jewelry, gold, etc. and learns what you are looking for. Both me and my (now) finance couldn't be any happier than Chris. You get custom jewelry from the experts!<//Text>

My Fiancé and I are currently long distance. I'm in Portland, Oregon. He wanted to surprise me and bought the engagement ring at Capri Jewelers in Los Angeles. The lady recommended a ring size of 6.5. It was a beautiful ring but we both noticed the setting was crooked towards one side. Another odd thing about the ring was that it was actually a size 6.75 when I attempted to get it resized in Portland. No jeweler wanted to take on the risk of damaging the settings on the ring. The band was too thin to resize from a 6.75 to a 4.5 due to the smaller diamonds on the setting. I had to spend money to insure and ship the ring back to him for the return.

Their website advertises a "30 Day Money Back Guarantee" no hassle return policy. This was not the case for us. Apparently this only applies to online purchases. We had the ring for exactly 10 days with all the paperwork and original packaging. They told my Fiancé that they do not have an "in store return policy." They offered to "buy back" the unused ring and even charged us for the tax and cost of setting the ring. We lost about a few hundred dollars. It's misleading to customers to not specify the in store return policy. Please get all the facts up front before you purchase here.<//text>

We have been going to Capri for over 20 years and there is no other company to buy from in our minds. Going Downtown LA can be very overwhelming and let me caution you about buying from just anyone. Capri is a company that if family owned and will always be there for its customers. I have referred many many friends and family to them and each experience report back to me has been OUTSTANDING. Friends of mine have actually come from NYC to buy from them because of TRUST and HONESTY. They are never pressuring you and only want you to be happy. These are wonderful people and we adore the entire family of Capri Jewelry. Lisa Dutra</review>

<Text>Embarrassed it has taken me this long to write a review. I had my engagement ring re-set when we were picking our wedding bands in June for an august wedding. Capri  is THE BEST. The gentleman helping me was a soft-spoken man and a pleasure to work with. I had done a lot of price/comparison shopping; I wanted a little extra bling, something different, and the best price...I got all that at Capri! People are always complimenting my wedding set and I am thankful to the gentleman helping me for helping me feel confident in my decision. ALSO, I recently moved and was very hard on my hands. I wound up getting my hand crushed and one of the little diamonds in my wedding band got knocked out.I couldn’t  find it…I called Capri, they told me to come in and in 15 minutes I had a new diamond and they sent me upstairs to the jewelry maker who re-set it for me…all free of charge! That is service. I have never been this happy with any service in my life…(I’m a Jewish NYC skeptic…so that should really drive home the point)…save yourself some time and go straight to Carpi!< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Chris was amazing to work with- all aspects of the diamond buying process were explained to me, and the needs I expressed were easily met.  I ended up with the most *perfect* tennis bracelet for my mother, and couldn't be happier.<//review>

<Rate>4< /Rate><pics>None<//pics><Text>Love this store. Wide selection, fresh products and clean store overall. Employees are very helpful in helping you find things and very positive. However, 4 stars because today’s experience was not 100% satisfaction. Everything went well, but at the register, young lady Olivia tried putting 15 items in one bag. I was confused and didn’t appreciate sitting raw meat, dairy, vitamins and veggies together. I nicely asked her to separate it in two bags so I can at least grab it by the handles. She gave me attitude and threw my receipt at me. I’m not sure where her frustration came from, not all shoppers like and appreciate their bags of groceries overfilled. Maybe just take into consideration training cashiers how to bag products right or let the customer do it themselves.< /Text><user>110724616677820782718<//user><Response>None< /Response>< Name>

<Review>I have been shopping at their Dublin store since they opened a couple years ago. This one is less than a year old. Carry the same stuff, different store layout. The staff is not as friendly, more low key.

If you never been to a Sprouts, you must. It's like if Whole Foods and Trader Joes had a love child, this is what it would look like. Like a Whole Foods, but at Trader Joes prices. Extensive bulk food selection (roasted salted okra, coconut flour, macadamia nuts, all kinds of candy, including sugar free).

I love their fresh fruits and vegetables selection (organic and conventionally grown) and fresh meat counter. Not as extensive as Lunardi's, but I do buy my fresh turkey every year for Thanksgiving at Sprouts. Large house made chicken and pork sausage selection. You can request any sausage to be made bulk.

7/15/17 Update: Very impressed! To encourage kids to eat fresh fruit and a lifetime of eating healthy, Sprouts is now offering at kids height-self-serve free fresh fruit in the produce area. NIce!<//Review><Time>1500142053002<//Time>< user_name>

We use to go to Sprouts weekly for vegetables  when my wife was juicing.  Then Covid19 hit and that was that.  Now, it's only for occasional items like probiotics or bag of carrots. Otherwise, most everything else is purchased between Target and Trader Joe's. Maybe, Ace Hardware opening soon will  bring back a reason to shop at Sprouts.< /review>

As always, another great experience. All the produce is fresh and well presented. I have a challenge finding a specific brand of sea salt cookies and the lady at the cashier went out of her way to find them for me. Fortunately there was no one behind me so we did not hold up the line. Is very unique and almost not an every day occurrence to see someone get out is the way to help. I will for sure remember. She needs to be acknowledge, therefore I will go back tomorrow to get her name and ask for her permission to give her the credit she deserves. Thank you and may God bless you for your kindness.</Text>

<review>I would normally give Sprouts a five star rating because their store is always clean, the employees friendly and courteous,  and they have so much to choose from. But the last time I was in I was having trouble finding an item. Because of the Covid precautions their bulk bins were all changed around and items I used to by all the time weren't where they normally were. I approached an employee that was near a closed registered and called out to them. Due to being on one of their store mobility devices it was difficult to get real close because of some obstacles. He completely ignored me the first two attempts until I raised my voice. When he did acknowledge me he looked annoyed.  I asked him where I could find the item I was looking for, he paused. Made a half- hearted attempt to look from where he was standing,  then made a call for another employee to look for him. No acknowledgement from him at all and then he just went back to whatever it was he was doing before.  I've always received excellent customer service in Sprouts. This guy didn't even try to look like he cared one bit. The gentleman that did show up to help me was very kind and helpful.  That's why it  still gets 4 stars. To bad they have someone like the first guy working there. He brings them down.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

This Sprouts location is usually pretty clean and well stocked. The groceries are usually pretty fresh. Pandemic times are a bit challenging but otherwise great buying experience. Sprouts also carries some gourmet salsas and other things that you won't find anywhere else.<//Review>

I just bought a package of Sigdal Herbs & Sea Salt Norweigan Crispbread on 12/29/2020. When I got home and went to eat some I see the expiration date on the package was 11/29/2020!!!! Despicable, I’m not in the habit of shopping at Sprouts and probably won’t be going forward. They were $4.99!!! Yikes!!! U bet I will be returning them tomorrow and thanks for nothing Sprouts as your store is out of my way. You should be ashamed!!!<//Review>

Sprouts is great but if you go before 11 am or so not everything is stalked yet. I'm an instacart shopper and that makes it difficult to shop.</Text>

Like all Safeways it's overpriced. However! It's safe, clean and the staff is very nice. Some of the employees have been there over twenty years and know us by name. That makes a difference...</Review>

<Text>This location is about average for a Sprouts. Clean, well-stocked, everything in its place. Customer service is better at the manager level: regular employees  are typically in monotone and not proactively engaging customers,  even before covid.  Certainly this location is a notch above the Dublin branch. Expect longer lines at both locations as hiring  continues in the wake of the shutdown<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<review>Today around 11:50am, I received some very bad service. I asked the lady  who was working in the health food area to help me find what I was looking for.  She was not willing to help and was very rude in her responses.
I have been shopping at this location for years.  Most of the workers are very helpful and friendly.   But, the one I encountered today was an exception.  I truly hope, I will not see her again at this location.<//review><Date>1587155905647</Date><user_name>N WU< /user_name>< Resp>

<review>Good selection of products. Limited selection of named brand items...but their house brand usually pretty good. Excellent pricing on meat and poultry items...with good quality being offered. Wide selection of produce items at prices usually considerably lower than major food chain stores. Following and checking specials can give you considerable discounts even from their already lower prices. Great spice selection where you can but just what you need versus full bottles that sit on your shelves unused for years!!!<//review><Rating>4</Rating><time>1545950406071< /time>< gmap_id>

Great food.  Great Sandwiches from the Deli.  The absolute worst business I have ever dealt with when it comes to answering and helping customers on the phone.  If you call this store to order a sandwich from the Deli, you most likely will sit on the phone for 15+ minutes if you have the patience to wait.  Just out of curiosity, while working at my desk, I tried to do an endurance test to see how long I could hold out and I have been on hold on the phone with this store for over 40 minutes.  I'm not sure if their phones have an audible ring.

*EDIT 8/29/19* Just an update after multiple years for comparison and to see if there has been any improvement to this area of criticism.

Still atrocious.   Its clear that there are members of the staff that have no interest in customer service.   An attempt to speak to someone on the phone in the deli was made 5 times.
First attempt:  Clerk answered the phone and happily transferred me to the deli.   The Deli then picked up the line and immediately hung up.
Second attempt: Line rings, is answered and then is hung up.
Third attempt: Clerk answered the phone, apologized that I was hung up on (when mentioned *not aggressively, just matter of fact) requested I stay on the line and he'd have someone get right with me.   The Deli picked up the line a short while later, and then immediately hung up.
Fourth attempt: Line rings, is answered and then is hung up.
Fifth attempt: Line rings, is answered and then is hung up.

I would also like to note that each time the line was picked up and hung up, it wasn't immediate.  It was clearly manual as I could hear background noises of the store before the end 'click'.

This is not a big deal because I can take my business elsewhere.  I like the sprouts chain, however, trying to deal with the San Ramon branch is the equivalent of inflicting pain on myself.

It should be noted that the service standards of this location have not improved any over 3-4 years and the staff (at least part of it) has absolutely no interest in putting any effort into what they were hired for.< /Text>

Awesome market with fresh local choices, and good meats also. Be sure to check out the ad when you walk in. When stuff is on sale, its a great deal. Love the bulk foods like nuts, candies, dried veggie products and more. Similar to whole foods, but less expensive since not all is organic/ultra high quality.< /text>

Good place for fresh meat and vegetables. I am surprised by the cheaper rates here when compared to Wholefoods. The lines are normally short  during weekends. Conveniently located next to many restaurants and Bishop ranch which houses many work places.<//Text>

Great place for nicks and nacks when it comes to cooking. Need to refill the spice rack? Get some fish sauce? Unroasted nuts for cooking with? Great place for all the odds and ends I find myself wanting to cook with. Saves breaking the bank and swinging by whole foods, much more quiet, much easier to get in and out.</text>

I love their weekly deals. Prefer going on Wednesday to get both the weeks deal. But be ready to hear they are out of stock on deal items.
Overall their organic section is fine<//Review>

The products in the store are not the problem. The boring employees (some just talk and talk and talk to you when all you're trying to do is get a sandwich and go) leave something to be desired of. Done don't seem very bright at all. The store is usually really dusty and I have even seen roaches there.

The management seems to be lacking as well. I've seen someone who I believe was the manager (short guy with what seems to be a Napoleon complex) berate and belittle employees in plain view.< /text>

Just purchased two ears of corn on the cob for 2 for a $1.00. They were awful. Hardly any kernels, no taste. What a waste.  Totally disappointed. Much better corn at Safeway or Costco. Rip off!<//review>

<Review>Some of the best and least costly produce you'll find in CoCo County. Premade meals, bulk items, etc. are terrific too. Only bummeraroo was to find on cooking that the sliced bacon in the meat dept. was old. You know, the bacon didn't sizzle, because it was old and on the verge of going real bad.< /Review>< Pics>

Good place for your quick grabs or even for lunch very good selection of bulk food such as granola nuts and even candies too very nice deli selection and fresh fruit and vegetables plus they have assorted meats and cheeses to include cheese curds parking is good but dont get discouraged by the checkout lines they normally get through them quick enough</Text>

I am not over the moon about boba but the drink was tasty and well made. You can sit outside, not inside. The virus knows not to come inside. Amazing no?</Review>

Good, friendly service. They can be a bit slow, but it’s worth the wait! Always accommodating.<//review>< pictures>

<rating>5< /rating><text>friends and i got the rose petals, taro kisses, and house milk tea. all were soooo delicious & the boba was the perfect texture & sweetness! my personal favorite was the rose petals at 100% sweetness. the taro was also amazing & there were real pieces of taro inside too - not artificial tasting at all. love love love!!

workers were also very sweet & took safety measures seriously.

Tasty taste classic milk tea. Flavorful and just enough sweetness for us at 50% and less ice. The boba there always have the right amount of sweetness and a good level of chewiness.  Love that it is close to the hood and they got games! Will be coming here more often.<//review>

<review>This is some of the best tea I've ever had in San Francisco!

I happened to be in the Castro District and suddenly had a craving for boba. I happened upon Qualitea and I couldn't have been happier with my drink and my experience. They have a great variety of drinks so there's really something there for everyone!  I so happy to have found this tea shop and I can't wait to go back and try another drink.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrVQC4RVPBGO34Y9-1VxqaodonhmLwhevOQnq2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< resp>

I ordered a hot no sugar oolong milk tea with boba, costing me 5.25, which I considered expensive, but conceded is typical for that area. I could taste the oolong although it was not as strong as the drinks in Taiwan or Hong Kong. It was nicely hot, which I find is not the case in a number of places here where cold drinks are the norm. As the place was not busy, I had a seat to myself in the center table and enjoyed the quietness.<//review>

<Review>Cozy spot with high quality fully customizable tea drinks. There are a few board games available to play, and one table with an outlet by it if you need to charge your phone or laptop.

I've been to this place several times when I go visit and this place is absolutely amazing! They do a great job of making drinks that are creamy but still have the tea flavor. So far I've had three of the specialty drinks but I can't wait to go again to try the rest!< /Text>

I am an AVID bubble tea drinker. I get it at least 2 times a week. I like to try out different places and I've gotta be honest , i didnt LOVE it here. I always get taro milk tea. It wasn't sweet, creamy, like usual, instead a VERY bland and watery. She remade it for me which I greatly appreciate and that makes me give it 3 stars instead of 2. Tha ambiance of the place is casual and clean, modern.< /Text>

<text>I was enjoying a late Summer in SF with about 80-degree weather, so I went with the passion cooler, passion fruit green tea so thy citrus juice and mint, and I added jelly. They have me too much ice and too much sweet, given that I ordered little of each, but it was refreshing, although not much liquid after a tall thin cup with lots of ice. The menu has some good variety, but not a crazy menu, which is actually kind of nice. They have a chalk board with a few specials. I expect you’d find something like whatever you’re looking for in the boba department.

There’s a decent amount of seating, but not really enough to make it a sit and work kind of place, more of a sit with friends while drinking your bev kind of place. They have a couple of tables outside. The staff are friendly. It’s included in the Castro fest boundaries. I checked in on yelp for a free topping!<//text>< UserId.>

My rose latte + tapioca bubble tea was really good for the 2-3 first sips. Then, it was awfull, tasting like a trully bad coffee. I don't know how that can happen and I am very disappointed.</text>

Pretty decent compared to church st coffee's powdered bubble tea, but nothing too special. Prices are high and has limited options. Bubba guys are still top dogs in the mission Castro walking radius. The dirty panda is pretty tasty if a little heavy and thick feeling.< /Text>

<Text>I forget what business they replaced, but I think coffee shop. Bright place with boba industry setting. Seating is limited to a communal like table, but a few tables outside as well. The employees are cool, witty and outspoken. Took me about three minutes to decide what I want, but that's when they come through. Told them why I like and don't like, then they made suggestion. Drink is alright made to my specifications of no ice and low sugar. Boba were nice and chewy not to soft and holds shape of roundness. They were up front when asked if it was real taro pieces or powder. It was the latter, but at least I know ahead of time.< /Text>< Response>

< Review>
The first Authentic Boba Shop in Castro Area.  The boba is so good and the sweetness level is exactly what I want ( you can choose the sweetness level) . All the specialty drinks are good also.  My friends tried the deluxe punch and rose petal.  They all love them. I can’t wait to go back and try the rest of the specialty drinks !!<//Review>

<rate>3<//rate><text>I've tried their "Matcha Blossom" (which is essentially a matcha latte with strawberry puree) and I thought it was just ok.  It would have been nice if they had milk alternatives, which they didn't.  I haven't tried any of their other drinks, but I definitely would not go out of my way to come here.  This is a nice place to stop by for boba only if you are in the neighborhood.  Whats nice about this place is that they have some games for you to play if you're hanging out.< /text>< pics>

Wow this place is amazing!  The service is top notch.  Qualitea is a tea shop specializing in boba tea.  They have some amazing speciality drinks like the Deluxe Punch and Matcha Blossom.  My favorite is the grapefruit drink that features fresh grapefruit and flavoring.</Review>

Genuine Boba tea focus, not gimmicky, in the Castro, block and a half off the Castro on 18th (formerly Phil's Coffee) and NOT next to corporate coffee.  Their milk tea is as good as this basic gets, and you get to tweek it to make it your own.<//review>

Small store, but the staff is very knowledgeable. They were very thorough about the questions I had regarding data rates and fees, not to mention polite about it as well. More phone companies should adopt this mentality instead of trying to force extra fees on you for no reason. Kudos to you BM.< /text>

The manager there refused to help me as soon as I stepped through the doors. In fact, she was yelling, trying to make me feel like an idiot, raising her voice and being a complete pain. Not to mention she was calling her employees liars. Lucky for her I wasn't my old self. The new stayed calm... I don't recommend this place to anyone. I will never go back here and my service was changed.</text><Rate>1</Rate><user>104790328219428471649< /user><time>1558366930645<//time>< gmap_id>

<Text>I really don't like to post reviews online, I rather tell people in person what I think about a business, but Andre really deserves a shout out, he's the best at this location, he knows everything about iPhones and is very helpful, my mom and I went to see why my mom's iPhone 6 was overheating, he examined the phone and told us that iPhone was replacing the battery at low cost because an ios software issue, he even made the appointment for us with Apple store in Modesto. I strongly recommend him.
I told his manager that he went above and beyond to help us even when he was by himself and the store was busy at the time we went. I give him a 10!< /Text><date>1534904493039<//date>< user>

Linda was so helpful with my new iPhone 5s. $99 for the phone and a great family plan. They reset all my passwords and got me unlocked on my icloud and made sure that I was set up before I left. Great Store!!!< /review>

(Translated by Google) This is the best Boost Mobile location that I have been to! Excellent customer service for years. The young man that works there is incredibly helpful and knowledgeable - he always welcomes his costumers with a smile! This Boost Mobile location also offers its services with Spanish speaking workers. They always have very good promotions!

<text>I went in about a couple of weeks ago to buy a product from a collection I collect.
I was pleased to see the Maleficent item I wanted in stock. I was a little put off that it was $319 when, on Amazon and another store it was priced at $255. I was excited and really happy when they were able to price match from the other store.
I was asked to examine the item and I did.
The only items I was not able to verify was her hands that detach from her arms. The cashier wrapped those up fairly quickly, and I didn’t get a chance to view them.

I came home, excited about this purchase and I opened my item. Upon opening, I saw that one of the hands had been previously repaired with glue and the other hand had a red mark on it.
I was shocked that they were asking so much over the market price.  I realize that they were able to price match at the $255 price point, but considering it was damages, there should’ve been a bigger discount. I returned the item the same day.

I went in the store today and that SAME item, that I purchased, was “fixed” and put back on display for the SAME amount of $319.
When I asked the cashier “How could you guys put this item back on the shelf for the same price?” She looked at me and told me that “Management told me to put it back because it was salvageable.” I told her “There isn’t even a sign that states the item was repaired or damaged.” She told me “I’m just the messenger.” She didn’t seem concerned at all that this company was misrepresenting it’s product and it’s condition.
There is NO REASON a damaged/repaired item should be sold above market value WITHOUT acknowledging that it was repaired.
This is what you call abusing the customers.<//text>< Pictures>

<rate>5< /rate><review>A great place to shop for collectibles. A wide selection of items. This place has a lot of wonderful Disney art. They also have some vintage Disney items, you can't find anywhere else. Their collectibles are very affordable..
It is very nostalgic if you go here. They have a lot of items from different places, from the early years of cinema, and television as well. A lot of interesting items to look at.</review>< pics>

<Review>Stage 9 is located on the ground floor of one of the most historic of the California's historical landmarks, located on the Southeast corner of front and K street.

Back in the day when you got off a riverboat you could go across the street and get a room there.

It was built in a "fire proof building and thus survived many of the fires that periodically burned through Sacramento in those days.</Review><UserId.>104472193382828408357< /UserId.>< Pictures>

To verify if the associate verified with me if everything was included.Also bout 2 paintings worth over 1000 dollars the same day,but screw me.Never shopping here again.< /Review>< rating>

<Review>Short version: cool store. Terrible customer service

The actual story: The store itself is pretty neat and had a nice selection. Unfortunately the customer service staff (if you want to call them that) were very incompetent. It took them at least twenty minutes to ring up the customer in front of me due to them not knowing the price of an item. That's a pretty common problem in any store, so I understand they can't help that. However instead of taking  any intuitive to figure out the price they just stood around. 4 employees,  two cash registers, and not a single ounce of caring about either the customer in front of me or me. When you see someone is waiting because I a problem, tell them about the problem. Open up another cash register to keep the line moving. Or if that's broken then apologize to me and everyone else waiting. It's not that hard to pay some attention to your customers and keep them informed as to why they are waiting when there are 4 people doing nothing.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

They sell damaged goods, don't give you a refund, and tell you that the manager will call you to resolve the issue. I'm still waiting for call, that was four months ago. They really deserve negative five stars.< /text>

I want to take the time out of my very busy day at work to write this review of this openly racist store located at 102 K St, Sacramento, CA 95814, named Stage Nine Entertainment. I want to specifically recognize the brown bearded skinhead Gavin, who spends his time while working harassing African American teenagers as they come in a look around/shop in the novelty store.

My son whose a regular 14 year old kid, whose fun-loving intelligent, inquisitive and well traveled was spending his time in Sacramento with his cousin a (white kid), yes my family is mixed raced. When they both walked inside and around the moviestore looking at the tshirts and other stuff. The skinhead Gavin or Thor approached them singling my 14 year old out by asking him what he wanted. My son said he was looking around. I might be out of date a bit with how things are done now a days because I am a 70's baby from the Bay Area.. But isn't that what kids (no matter what racial makeup) do during the summer break, they visit family members, go to stores or hang out at the malls?

Well apparently not when Gavin is working because when he hatefully tailed my son around the store making him feel uncomfortable with the harassment. My son minding his business was asked to leave the store without reason. When my son intelligently asked why like any mindful person would. Gavin answered like any tough toy shop worker would, "because you look suspicious." Well isn't that great, so Stage Nine Entertainment are racial profiling? I'm glad he made that clear and gave my son his very first experience with racism while shopping (we are in 2014 right?).

I hope that John Paul the manager understands what his employee is promoting (hate). Because you can best believe that never in life enter into his racist establishment and I will continue to post this experience on every review site possible.

"#Stage Nine Don't Serve African Americans", I'm glad we found that out, but not glad that my son whose a hard working straight A student in one of the best private schools in Bay Area, who regularly volunteers at the library to teach kids how to read, participants and wins technology hack-a-thons, who can present critical frames of thought to a room full of scholars, businessmen and his peers and have them captivated had to come face to face with a very hateful, numb, degenerate of a person named Gavin while shopping doing what all kids do his age.

Situation like this should not be tolerated, I hope that everyone who reads this review really understands the hurt I feel for what my son experienced at this store. He doesn't deserve that nor does anyone else. Google Plus Review being a powerful tool can shift business to and from a businesses. Lets shift business away from this disgusting place and put stores like these out of business for good because we don't need them around period!< /text>

< review>
First time trying Poke bowl i was very hesitant I called the restaurant for advice on what to order the girl was very nice I got a med poke bowl with two springs 1 scoop of rice spicy tuna/ salmon scallops /green onion etc. It was delicious I must say give it a try add pineapple it balances the salty sweet loved it can't wait to try some more. Why 3 stars some of the ingredients I requested are missing jalapenos for one watch that!! But it was well worth it ordered through door dash yummy..</review>

Service was great, all 3 people behind the counter were super friendly and attentive. Food is great! Fish tastes super fresh and every add on is also great tasting. The place is clean and organized.

The only downside is for the small portion the price is big. We got two small bowls which are around half of what you would get at any other poke place and it ended up being $28 with no drinks or anything, so heads up if you're on a budget.

Other than that, great poke place!</review>

THE BEST of all the Poke Bars in town. It's all down to the ownership and the employees and out of ALL the Poke Bar franchises, THIS IS THE _ONLY_ ONE worth supporting with your patronage.< /Text>

This place is great! The staff is awesome, very friendly, service is helpful. They offer and explain all the toppings and options. Best pokebar I've been to by far. Would reccomend going here 💯. Fish was fresh, rice was well cooked and the toppings were cold. The bathroom was also pristine. Everything in the place was shiny clean. Very well taken care of. So good I decided to take some time out of my day to make sure I took nice pictures. They deserve lots of business!</text>

Absolutely Yummy! Very fresh. Polite employees. Nice variety. Price is higher than other places but since there in not much poke bowl competition in that immediate area, they can charge higher prices. Well worth it though. Will be going back.</Review>

This is an amazing place. The food is great and the customer service is excellent. My girlfriend and I stumbled across this place on a whim, glad we took a chance. I have mentioned it to some coworkers and they agree that this place is awesome. Fresh food and great vibes can't go wrong with that.<//text>

<Review>This place is similar in concept to a Panda Express - pick any 2/3 protein items, add starch, etc - but, the food is anything but. I got a small bowl with spicy tuna and salmon and a bunch of veggies (you can get as many as you want) with brown rice. The rice was a bit dry (as brown rice is often wont to be), but otherwise the mix was excellent. The person preparing my meal suggested keeping the spicy tuna separate from the salmon (normally they mix everything together by hand). I am not sure that made much of a difference since I was eating all of them together.
Overall, a good experience and I am certainly inclined to go back again.< /Review>< time>

<text>Less is more when it comes to poké - little more than fish and rice is needed - though it seems that rule is observed at exactly zero poké joints these days so I guess I'll just roll with it.  Poké Bar isn't perfect, but it's far better than most of its kind.  I went with the tuna, spicy tuna, and salmon bowl and it was pretty outstanding.  Especially for how crowded this plaza constantly is, this is a very decent option.< /text>< Pictures>

The service was good, but way over priced and not enough flavor. The imitation crab meat was so dry and flavor less. They charge me 18$ for a medium bowl and a drink. Almost forgot, i added avocado for a 1$ extra. First time paying for avocado at any poke spots.< /text>< rating>

Didn't know this spot even existed. Make sure you pull into the plaza and enter that way which is the front. A lot of options and a very friendly staff. Kale noodle is the best base!< /Review>

<Review>Always love their food and customer service is great, but sad to say...the last customer service on Sunday afternoon was very disappointing. The young girl we served me was not friendly, had a chip on her shoulder, and made me feel unappreciated!! Hopefully, the management needs to stress the importance of how you treat your customers makes a difference in the business.<//Review>< userid>

Quality to price is superb!  Everything I ordered was very good.  Just uni was not.  But oysters on another hand were amazing! Overall I really like the place.  Today was not my first time here, and for sure not the last.   Highly recommend< /Text>

This place used to be a hidden gem for good sushi for cheap. Now it's typically a busy joint that gives me a mixture of good and so so sushi. On a good day it's good solid sushi for the price. On a bad day, the sushi could have a overwhelmingly fishy after taste. I still go here once in awhile though. Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and/or Saturdays for their special daily hand rolls.</Text>

DISCOLORED OLD FISH.. Me and my family got sick for 2 days (vomiting and diahrea) from the old discolored salmon and smelly yellow tail. I have been a patron for this restaurant for several years and on my last visit during a weekday lunch the sushi not only smelled off but was very tough and chewy. When we called, the hostes dismissed the situation and said she would call the manager and "see" if she could get us credit. I could care less about credit, I'd rather you just serve you're customers fresh fish and don't cheap out. Never eating here again. If u do plan on eating here make sure the fish is fresh and try to go on a weekend.</Text>

Food : Out of all the revolving sushi bars I have been to, this restaurant possibly could have the best quality fish. Their fish is very fresh if your order it through server or the  list paper they provide you to turn in. I have not seen too many places with Escolar, so it was fantastic to see that they had this sushi/sashimi. Also, keep your eye out for their  daily deals on their hand rolls; it's definitely a steal.

Service/Environment: Their service is pretty quick. Although, due to popularity, you should expect a wait during peak hours.

Price: Price is definitely great for their sushi/sashimi. But with their price definitely expect the presentation to be just average. They charge you depending on the plate the sushi/sashimi comes in, so just be aware how much you accumulate because it does add up quickly!

Overall: Kaisen Sushi Bar has got to be my favorite revolving sushi bar. It definitely is my go to for after work dinner. It is the kind of place where you feel comfortable eating by yourself or with a group. They have incredible fresh fish and huge variety of food for a very reasonable price. Just note that its not the cleanest sushi bar around, but it definitely is worth going to!<//text>

Watching the sushi go around on the conveyor belt was an experience in of itself. The sushi was really good too. Freshly made with good quality ingredients.</text>

Today was an exception, however, and it wasn't even that crowded... I had to wait 45 minutes for my order to come out, asked the waitress and turns out they forgot completely. THEN had to wait 25 more minutes to get a baked scallop rolls that crumbled apart and leaked out this nasty juice underneath.  I was able to pour THIS much out from under it. I don't think it's fair to take away all merits from just one bad experience but this was pretty bad.< /Review><UserId.>112239800115705725821< /UserId.><Name>Chris Giang</Name>< rating>

Wow what can I say, I’ve been coming here for years, because of covid we have to wait outside once we order. We waited for over an hour and they didn’t bring me my food. I went inside and they said “oh you had to come inside to get the food” then 5 minutes later they bring out the other people food to them. I don’t want to assume anything but I think it’a because we are Mexican and the other couple was Asian. Never coming again. The attitude they had was disgusting. They’re usually nice but not lately<//review>

<rating>4<//rating><Review>It's hard to beat the price of their daily specials. $1.75 for a spicy scallop hand roll or negi toro hand roll, etc depending on the day. Very affordable depending on what you get. Food is just okay though, nothing too amazing. The more expensive items were decent as well.

Favorite was probably the uni and snow crab. $3.50 for two pieces of decent uni - how can you beat that? Least favorite was the Cajun salmon, baked mayo salmon and baked mussel. Those were just bad lol.

Waitresses were nice and attentive, but the host seemed a little flustered at handling more than two customers at a time.</Review>< pics>

<Review>This is my favorite sushi place. Selection and quality is excellent. It’s popularity is well deserved, but when I see people waiting outside to get in, I don’t even stop. The wait times can be brutal. Seating is limited, so that’s not helpful. The best time to go to ensure you get right in on a weekend? Show up when they open at 11:30am. Any other time, it’s a coin-flip.</Review>< user_id>

While the sushi and ambiance would have received a 5 star rating, the rotating sushi bar and value put it over the top! There wasn't brown rice sushi, which I prefer, but the fish was top quality. We ordered a couple of eel sushis, and chose the rest of our rolls from the ever rotating bar next to us. The rolls were fresh and delicious! I also ordered a side salad that I did not care for, expecting a typical ginger Asian salad. It had corn and tomatoes, lettuce and seaweed with a soy based sauce.meh. It's also a small establishment, so get there before the rush. I will definitely be going here again!<//text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<text>Our go to sushi place! The moving conveyor belt sushi table gives a nice sushi place theme to the place. Their sushi taste superb. I always get the kobe beef tataki, medium fatty tuna and eel. They also have specials every day of the week! So if you want great sushi and great food come here!< /text></record>

Hidden away in Santa Ana this place has really good fresh fish and good atmosphere. I was pleasantly surprised for my first time. I had salsom sushi, seared salmon sushi, eel and more.

The only bad is the customer service. It wasn't horrible but it could improve. Overall a great experience and I'll be coming back.<//Text>

<Review>I would give this restaurant 4 stars if the waiters are friendly and courteous. Unfortunately, all of them are blunt at best, some of them openly display f-you attitude to their customers like one of them cheap midnight diner. I didn't realize until my neighbor customer(a couple of 60s) finally had enough and complained of their terrible  service quality. You actually have to STOP them to ask for something, they will avoid eye contact without remorse, and they won't say thank you. To be fair, their food is good so I feel sorry for the chefs that the waiters are spoiling the good credit that the shop would deserve. They should just fire and replace all the waiters there.<//Review><gmapID>0x80dcdf2f29f3afcf:0xdf9dae8f8bffa9d6</gmapID>< date>

<review>I think, at least within Orange County, this is #1 revolving sushi restaurant. The quality of their seafood is amazing for their price level. The service is attentive and fast. While I don't enjoy the long wait time, I do understand this is what happens when a restaurant is successful and everyone wants to be there.</review>< Pics>

<text>First, they have awesome sushi and alot of options on the menu 😋 Never been disappointed by the food, the chefs are consistent and take pride in their dishes. Almost always a crowd but they manage it very well. Most of all, I really like the staff. They are courteous and professional.  Many years ago I had an experience which could have been terribly embarrassing...this racist guy refused to sit by me, insisted on being seated elsewhere. I swear the hostess could not figure out what his problem was cause he wouldn't explain...but I knew and so did others watching. She truly was colorblind! Her supervisor swiftly stepped in and told the guy to sit or leave! They don't tolerate that kind of discrimination. From that day they've seated me close to the chefs where honestly is the best seat 😋 All this to say they are genuinely awesome people. You won't go wrong visiting here ☺️< /text>< Pics>

I was always curious about this place finally decided to try it out. In summary it's a small place with shared seating. Conveyor belt was mostly empty when I went. Last but not least they use these plastic lids to cover the dishes as they go around the table on the belt. Those lids need to be clean. They were not. Grossed me out so I only had one plate. Staff is nice.</Text>

The sushi is delicious! It seems so good the minute you go inside! It does take quite a bit of waiting time to get seated on most days which is why this isn't a five star review but overall it's good food.<//text>

Fun place for the kids with the conveyor belts carrying sushi, including cheesecake and eclairs (likely just bought from supermarket nearby).  Sushi was ok, but nothing special, and they have hamachi kama on the menu as an app, but it's only fried! All their non-menu items are fried, even the teriyaki chicken or beef.  Super disappointing -  the waitress claimed the cook can only fry during the day, can't use the grill/broiler until dinner service.< /review>

Thursday is the day to go to Kaisen!

Everyday they have a hand roll special for $2.25 and on Thursdays it’s soft shell crab which my husband is a big fan of.

Inside the restaurant there is a large revolving bar area with 3 booths for larger parties.

There is usually always a wait when we go, but totally worth it.

You can pull food off from the conveyor belt and/or use the special ordering slips of paper for your choice of rolls, sushi, sashimi, and hand rolls.

They also have Kirin beer on draft and a pitcher is only $10.95! 🍻<//review>

Pretty good sushi. The kids love the conveyor belt options, and we like how fast it is.  In and out, not too expensive, and good specials on beers. Quality sushi at reasonable prices.<//Text>

<text>Starting from the outside this place looks like it's going to be a small restaurant with about 6 tables. When I went in, was I surprised. The length of the restaurant is actually pretty long and can accommodate a good amount of people. Even though it was a packed house the ambiance was pretty mellow. Usually other places I have been to are loud and you are not able to hold a conversation but this place is a different story. Their rotating sushi bar was great and offered a great variety of options. You are able to order from the menu and have come down the conveyor belt. Their turnaround time is very fast so you are not left waiting  too long for orders. The quality and taste of the Sushi here is great. I highly recommend it. You will get a bang for your buck as the prices are accessible.<//text><user_id>116266494564344905879< /user_id></record>

<text>I had been taking family here because of the fun, and bringing business associates here to show the Japanese cuisine tradition, but today is my last. If you come, get to seats 1-7 so you can see how and who prepare your food.  I wish I can fully express how intimidating those workers became when we politely declined orders (5) that we didn't place. Not sure if people would believe in saving a few bucks and get the humiliation in return. Not in Costa Mesa.<//text><Response>None<//Response><Rate>1< /Rate><GmapID>0x80dcdf2f29f3afcf:0xdf9dae8f8bffa9d6<//GmapID><Time>1545622799787< /Time><userid>105474354713594293540< /userid>< Pictures>

Small strip mall robotics sushi joint that has seen better days. The place is run down and has a dirty feel to it. Sushi was hit or miss. I would skip this place and go to the robotics sushi in the Santa Ana mall.< /text>

Kaisen is one of my favorite sushi places around Orange County. Sure there's fancier ones but when sushi is floating around my head around dinner time, Kaisen is where I'm headed.

It's great eating alone or for smaller parties (2-3) since the majority of seating is at the rotating sushi bar. There are tables that seat up to 4 comfortably but the wait for those are usually pretty long.

I highly recommend getting the Kaisen roll and salmon nigiri.</Text>

Do not come to this place if you want fresh fish. We tried the halibut and had to spit it out. The seared mackerel and ono both tasted old as well. The sweet shrimp was so small and not worth the price. The tempura udon was decent but oily. Only giving 2 stars because the service was good. Never coming back.< /Review>

Been going here for 2 years now. For the price you pay the sushi is very good. Its a revolvong sushi place but its best to order off of the paper sheet and have your items delivered fresh. The deal is on the handrolls, my favorite is the Softshell Crab handroll, Thursday its in special for just 3.25 I believe! Come check it out this is one of my favorite spots for good hand rolls and sushi.</Review>

Great place for cheap sushi with great taste. It tastes very fresh and is better than Kula Revolving Sushi. Service is quick and the system they used to send your sushi is organized. The lady servers are always so sweet and nice in their kimono. Wait is usually long if you're going for dinner during weekends. The wait during weekdays are better, so plan accordingly. Highly recommend their hand rolls!</Text>

Our party of 2 asked to be seated at a booth since only 1 was occupied and we are not comfortable sitting on stools at counter and were told no--small party sits on stools at bar and 2 people cannot occupy entire booth.  Didn't like the fact that sushi/sashimi/nigiri was carouseling around and not made upon order.  We didn't even order because of these issues and left.</Review>< Pics>

Small place, and gets packed fast on weekend nights. Somehow, even when operating at capacity, the food on the conveyor does not turn over quickly. So, unless you're okay with sushi that's gone around 10+ times, order off the menu...everyone else seems to. As for the taste, pretty decent, with a nice variety.<//review>

This is my favorite cheap sushi spot. I love salmon sushi more than anything and there's never a shortage of that on the conveyor belt. It's small. So I would only come here as a small party of 2-4 max. Everyday they have a handroll as the days special for only 1.75. Such a steal. We never spend more than $40 here as a couple<//text>

They have kept their prices very reasonable for over decade now (maybe longer), and the fish has always been good.  The fish to rice ratio on sushi is just right, without too much rice and generous slice of fish. They have a pretty good variety to choose from.  The salmon, hamachi(yellowtail), scallop, and squid are always worth getting.  I recommend also the giant shrimp tempura as a side order too.<//Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< username>

Good sushi. Middling service. The rotating sushi only had two different items on it for the first 30 minutes we were there. Won't be coming back.</text>

Our go-to sushi bar. Always good salmon and you can't beat their price. Softshell crab hand roll is amazing.<//review>

They have Spanish Mackerel.  And Japanese Makarel.  And actually a lot of good food.  Worth going back again.</Review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>Had to flag someone down the entire visit. We got our drinks brought to us and never saw someone again unless I waves them down. We were never told how to order or how anything works. The "high chair" is dangerous as hell. It's a booster seat strapped to a very high actual chair. Most of the food was good, however my guests and I felt nauseous and stomach aches for a while after we left. I came here since Blue C Sushi shut down and was trying to show some family conveyor belt sushi. Was so disappointed</Review><Date>1553935808431</Date><GmapID>0x80dcdf2f29f3afcf:0xdf9dae8f8bffa9d6<//GmapID>< resp>

<Review>OK food, really not so impressed. Maybe because I go to Japan a lot and sushi stores there have much better food and much better and attentive service.

For California, I think the sushi here at this store is not bad.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Absolutely incredible value. Everything is delicious and you get much higher quality than the prices would suggest. This is a revolving sushi bar so all items are made in the kitchen and rotate around on a conveyor belt for you to select at will, with an option to place special orders. Different plates are worth different prices -  there's a guide on the wall.  You get charged based on the colors of the inevitable plate tower you build as you eat. Keep your eye on the specials of the day and order a few from there.  The sea chicken is deceptively good for something so simple.<//review>

Wouldn't return.
Smelled a little fishy when we first walked in; however, the food tasted fresh. Just keep an eye out for plates sitting on the conveyer belt for too long.
I'm rating them 3 stars because their customer service was subpar. After we were seated they just walked away. There was no explanation of how their restaurant works, didn't bring us water, or ask if we wanted something else to drink.</review>

< Review>
Harassing me about my sister being disabled.  The seats are too high for her to get on. We havent had a issue before, but the lady here is  being very rude and skipping up because for a table where she can fit on because the seats are normal size . She said they need the tables for larger parties of 3 or more. The policy is actually 4 but shes lieing .
I told her I cant wait 2 hours because my sister is disabled and cant get on the high chair there like tall bar stools  I can hardly get on the chairs . The lady put 4 people in front of us already.  I did not even complain ,she came to me and said u have been waiting 1 hour,u should just go to a high chair because I'm going to have to make you wait another hour.  I told her that's discrimination.  She said not it's not, I'm telling you that your acting like shes hurt so you can just get a table .
The ladys name is AMY.<//Review>

This is one of those places that looks like another 'sushi bar' but man .. the flavors are like no other 'sushi bar' out there. The fish is always fresh and the staff are friendly most of the time. I go there now about once a week :)</Review>

<Text>Kaisen is one of my favorite sushi bars in Santa Ana. The restaurant is little on the small side seating about 40 or 50 people but it's worth the wait. It's located right off Bristol and Sunflower in the Staples shopping center.

This is a rotating sushi bar with daily specials. My favorite time of the week to go is on Mondays. $1.75 for Tuna hand rolls! I have been here so many times, I know the specials for each day, kind of funny and sad. Kaisen also has everyday specials like the Salmon Skin hand roll and the Negitora roll. The best place to sit is either at booths or close to the sushi chefs because you will get you're food faster.

I have never had a problem with the food. At times, the sushi on rotating belt can look dehydrated but just order directly off the menu if you want it. The Kaisen roll is one of my favorites -- 5 piece with spicy tuna, shrimp and the rolls are huge.

Service also great. Waitresses are rotating around the restaurant, ensuring your water is full or if you need something off the menu. The prices are very affordable. Menu items range from .99 to $9 depending on what you order. Give it a go and enjoy some delicious affordable sushi!<//Text>< rating>

Friend took me here saying its good. Wasn't that good at all!! The samon was chewing and stringy! Spicy tuna was okay. They didn't have a lot of selections that I was use to at other sushi rotating belt places. But whatever. Its cheap. And that's what you get pay. I wouldn't come here again. Just my opinion.</text>

Seriously the best quality fish and hand rolls in OC for this price. The conveyor belt is not a gimmick but used as utility. Get the salmon (sake) sashimi, you will be in heaven.< /review>

I LOVE Kaisen I've been going to this sushi restaurant for over 5 years. It's a small little restaurant but it is worth the wait I love sitting in front of the bar where they cut and make the sushi in front of you.< /Review>

This is my favorite sushi bar in Orange County located right next to the Staples and CVS by Party City it's almost always full but the wait is not really that long 15 to 30 minutes max the rotating sushi bar is really convenient because even if it's busy you can grab something off the belt and start munching my favorite is the salmon nigiri it's always fresh and delicious the prices are super low you can almost always get a full belly with food and drinks for 40 bucks the sake and beer happy hour prices can't be beat buy one get one!< /text>

<Text>I like this place.  I enjoy rotating sushi bars and they really must do something pretty bad for me not to like you.  Here, they have pretty good sushi and at pretty good prices.  Nothing to write home about but the service is good and you go home with a nice full belly of sushi. I will probably always pick rotating sushi bars when I get a chance just for the sheer spectacle of it.</Text>< Pics>

< Review>
Fish : not bad at all for convertbelt sushi place

Waitstaff : excellent customer service with traditional Japanese outfit (kimono)

Very comportaable booth

Sushi chef : no one smile , no customer service , they need a new experience sushi chef if they want the business long term

Parking : pretty good but , place is kind of hidden

Price : they seems pretty cheap but , pretty expensive if you like sushi or sashimi

Rolls are good price</Review>

A negative rating is what this location deserves. Waited for more than an hour and when I approached to ask how much longer they said 30-40  minutes more. They have a policy that states all parties need to be here, yet they do not follow it. Spots were available at the island and they had a table available, yet they would not seat us because the person in front of us was still waiting for the rest of the group to arrive. Why have a stupid policy on display and not follow it. This is how you go out of business. I called and asked to speak with the owner or manager and the first thing I hear is "you want to place an order?"  No, I want to file a complaint. Their response was "we have a policy to follow", REALLY, yet they don't follow it.< /Review>

This place is like any other revolving sushi place. It doesn't have temperature controlled plate and tops so you never know how long it's been sitting. I was there socializing with my gf for almost 2 hours and the same one was going around the revolving belt. I just order staight from the chef.<//Review>

STAY AWAY! The only items on the belt were crunch rolls and raw cabbage 'salad' drenched in sesame dressing. When you could snag a sushi plate, it was low quality, smelled fishy, and super thin (see the rice thru the fish). You can order off the menu, but it takes 10-15 minutes for each item to arrive. Also, what I thought were streamers hanging from the air conditioning were actually strings of DUST and GUNK. So gross.</text>

Service was decent at best and the chef missed out on an order. As for the sushi and sashimi ... delicious! I recommend the yellowtail and tuna.< /Review>

<Review>I think it was wednesday with daily special for lobster hand roll. You gotta try their lobster hand rolls and you won't be disappointed. Our of all revolving sushi restaurants i've been to, Kaisen kaiten is my favorite given their quality, consistency, and price. It's all around great place to enjoy sushi with relatively affordable cost in a fun setting. This is a popular place so be ready to wait.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

I was very excited about this place because I had heard good things. But my experience here was not great. The food itself is pretty good quality. The first round of food got to us within ten minutes. The second order never got to us even after talking to the waitress. We forgot to put our table number on our order form but immediately notified the waitress and she said she would take a look in the kitchen to see if they have it and that she would correct the problem but never returned or notified us that the issue had been resolved. My boyfriend and I sat there for twenty minutes waiting to hear something from the waitress or at least for our food to come out on the revolving bar. But nothing. The waitresses aren't attentive at all and will only come up to you if you call them over. After asking another waitress about our food she went to check the kitchen and claimed there was no order back there. We asked for the check instead. When we got the check, we were charged for a pricier item that we didn't order but paid for it because we didn't want anymore problems. During the entire meal, the only grab items that were on the conveyor belt were salmon sushi, seaweed salad, and edamame. Although we don't think they were deserving a tip, we still left one. Overall, I don't think I will return.</Text>

I have never given one star before but this place is one star only thanks to their chefs. I waited for two hours before even going in. Unless you are only going by yourself or with one friend on weekend night be prepared to wait at least 2hrs. This old lady who seems to be the one making spaces for everyone was really bad with running a store. She was letting people who are party of one or two first. later I notice people who came hour later than me was going in before me. I asked atleast four times when my party will be able to go in and only thing she said was "im sorry" smiling, she didn't look like she was comfortable speaking in english. first I was ok since the place was crowded. but after waiting for two hours I was done with her, even her smile or her apology didn't seem like real. So I told her that we want our name erased and I'm leaving. soon as I told her that she grabed my arm and said that the table was ready. 5mins before she said there is no space and I needed to wait and soon as I said Im leaving the table is magically ready. The service after was even worse. The lady threw a spoon at us when we asked for extra spoon cause only brought one even though clearly there are three people. The place is not organized with what employee should be doing. This girl who helped us, can't remeber her name well, she looked like the one who should be in charge and be a manager. Every mistake the lady makes the girl has to go back and fix everything. The food was very good but I take customer service as a big part of stores. If I ever want I go back I'm not comming back on the days when she will be there.</review>

Typical american kaiten-sushi. Not very authentic Japanese style, but reasonable price and taste.Interior is a bit crouded so you may find difficult to sit together in large group.</text>

Honestly can't beat their prices their Sushi is actually good in my opinion they have a great happy hour deals the only thing is they're always crowded so there's always a wait between 15 minutes to 40 minutes service is pretty good depending on how busy they are<//text>
