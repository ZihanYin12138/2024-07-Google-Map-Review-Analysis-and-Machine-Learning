My faaaaavorite! If you love veggies or meat you cannot go wrong at allll. Just make sure you fill your bowl up as much as you'd like because it dose cook down in size.<//text>

Food is absolutely great, love it! I come here whenever I go to the mall but today a caucasian woman just gave me attitude and was rude throughout the whole thing. I paid full and tipped. She wasn't wearing her mask properly and she took off her mask to ask a question. Again, the food is great but the woman isn't. The rest of the workers were really chill and polite but the woman was just ruining my experience.</Review>

<review>Honestly they don’t put sauce they put water because that’s litterly what I saw she didn’t put enough sauce so he added water. Had no flavor on top of that had the large plate and they gave me almost no noodles won’t be coming back. Don’t come stay away! Want better food take 15 steps to Thai kitchen. They also have better service just saying.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

I am very disappointed with the service I was given today. I purchased a large and the bowl was super small. The man behind the grill gave me attitude the entire time, he gave me dirty looks and rolled his eyes at me when I asked him to repeat himself. There was too much noise and I couldnt hear what he said. I will not be going here anymore and would not recommend it to anyone.<//text>

<review>First of all it says that it’s a buffet and you can eat as much as you can put in that little plate but as soon as you stack it up then they give you dirty side eye and tell you not to come back because they don’t make profit off of you. Mind you the large plate is very small and it costs around $12. Don’t come here better make it at home and let them lose their business. Greedy people.<//review>< Pics>

Don't laugh! Growing up we had an amazing Mongolian BBQ by my house which was my fav. Yet as the owner aged, it got too difficult and thus it was sold. Can you believe that in Jacksonville FL, the LARGEST city in the continental US (land wise), we don't have a Mongolian BBQ place!? Ah! We did eat at GK off Coffee Rd. once and that tore me up for a day or so - so we don't go back there.
It's $8.50 for a small bowl and $9.50 for a large bowl (GK's only alluring aspect is that it's unlimited). But flavor wise, I love this place! I choose beef and load up with carrots, water chestnuts, bean sprouts, and cabbage. They add the oils and I like mine spicy (Siracha!). Of course this means I'm eating as fast as I can because my nose is running, but I love it. It automatically comes with noodles but I always opt for rice. They cook your dish right in front of you on the Mongolian Grill and it's done! It's flavorful and I am so happy to come and eat here! I'm going to try and sneak in a second visit before I head back to FL....
ps: thankfully I've never experienced the rude man everyone on Yelp and FB and Google reviews complains about....and I hope I don't!</review><gmapID>0x8090504ec98781ad:0xf599d94e450823d7<//gmapID>< UserId.>

<review>After returning to this place for a long time the workers started being stingy with noodles and the amount of food on the bowl. Very rude lady taking my order and always seems to be in a bad mood. Never returning no matter how good the food can be.< /review><userid>109027962398340990453</userid>< Rate>

This place is awesome! They have great selection of ingredients and the price is pretty good. I like watching my food get cooked on the round griddle and the man making it beats the food it's really cool. It's always fun to watch your food get made.<//Text>

BUT TODAY 6/10/19, I a paying customer asked for a extra noodles because I had got a large Drink and a large bowl which came to $14.00. So the lady put 2 noodles YES JUST 2 in the small bowl that already had just a little bit of noodles to start with.  Then I asked the Gentlemen if he was the manager or owner his reply was ( yes I am do you want noodles or not) very rude he was. So I said you k how I do t want any noodles his reply was ( Fine I don't care) rude!. So then I said I just won't come back his reply ( I don't care don't come back) he knows I'm putting a review on here plus he had to THROW THE 14.00 BOWL AWAY!😎<//review>< Pictures>

The guy had no good hospitality and was EXTREMELY RUDE. He slops the food on the tray and speaks to you very rude. If he is the owner, he should be closed because he has no customer service ethics. Will never come here. I've been to several and this was by far the WORST</text>

Worst customer service ever! The man at the grill first snapped at me, telling me not to press the raw ingredients down in my bowl (I was trying to keep it from spilling all over), then motioned for us (no words) to move our bowls to another area. Once he had grilled  what was in my bowl, he haphazardly set the bowl down and just pushed it toward me, saying nothing. He was so rude, I will never eat there again! No wonder the place wasn't very busy. I'm betting by this time next year it will be out of business.<//Review>

FOOD IS AMAZING. One star rating because they closed 25 minutes early & refused to even take 25$ for just 2 plates. Could have easily just put the cash in the next day. Understand the register was already counted out. But seriously closing almost a half hour earlier & losing  $$ & decent tip was RIDICULOUS. SUPER disappointed. Ended up eating next door & they were great sandwiches! Thanks for NOTHING Fresh grill & great sandwiches next door!..< /Text>

The reason why I give it 2 stars because the owner is a HUGEEEEEEE DICK! He watches you as you put meat and veggies in your bowl and he gets mad when you put a lot of veggies in the bowl. He'll also throw your food onto the grill which in turn throws your food off of the side of the grill. The owner doesn't smile. He won't talk. He just stands there..... The dude has also coughed on my buddy's food while he was cooking it. He promptly got a refund. I've heard many people say they won't eat here because of the owner. He needs to learn how to run a business!!<//review>< Pictures>

On July 2, 2017 My mom and some her friends from church decide to try the Fresh Grill Mongolian BBQ for lunch.  My mom noticed something black in her food....and it had what appeared to be legs.  After closer inspection it was indeed a BUG.   With an unconcerned tone the manager said...."Sorry, do you want another plate, or a refund?"< /text>

If I could give zero stars I would.Apart from them making you feel so uncomfortable while picking your servings,the Asian old dude is extremely rude.He slams your plate on the grill throwing half of your food out.When my husband told him to be more cautious he ignored him my husband asked for the manager and he replied he was the owner if we didn't like how he did things to not come back.That was our last time there.Never ever will we go back.They have the worst customer service we have ever seen.</review>

Mongolian hot plate provided with options to do it yourself in two sizes. I found the staff Friendly and helpful and the serving line was efficient. A healthier option to sustain your body during these cruel and amoral times.</Text>

<Text>The first time I ate Mongolian bar-b-que I fell in love with it. Fresh Grill Mongolian BBQ food really tastes good, but the mall food court noise makes it a less fun meal. The location within the food, close to the exit, should help diminish the sound but it didn’t really help. Regardless of the noise, the food is really worth a stop.< /Text></record>

Won't eat here again. The veggies were not fresh and the cashier was not friendly. They charge for drink refills - who does that anymore?!? I suggest you head to panda express instead.<//text>

<Text>The food was good. The man/employee who cooked our food was rude!!  My boyfriend was trying to keep his food in the bowl and he smashed it down. The man said " you are not to smash it down." My boyfriend said" where does it say that" ( they give you all these instructions) He said " I'm telling you." We will never go back!< /Text><name>Judy Davis</name>< Resp>

Not sure if I'm the only one.. But their customer services is very poor... How hard is it to slap a smile face..😁😀. Not sure if he is the manager, but he is very rude😠😠😠. Poor workers will use him as an example.. Food is great...I'm giving this place a one star because the food was pretty tasty< /Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>I have been working with the Source Graphics team professionally for nearly 6 years now and could not be more impressed with their work, professionalism and customer service.

They maintain and service our plotters and scanners - a vital part of my organization's deliverables - and always provide the best service I could expect, whether during normal maintenance or when things go wrong (as should be expected with extremely complicated machines with moving parts).

I would like to specifically thank Asif for his superb competence and professionalism on his most recent visit; he went above and beyond to ensure our equipment was functioning at its best and went the extra mile to understand my concerns.

In addition, may I also provide my utmost thanks to their other team member's Paul and CJ, who have both provided wonderful service and support to our department numerous times previously.

Absolutely stellar service from this company. If you care about results and quick responses from a company who cares go with Source Graphics.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80dcd115c96c4965:0xbe508039b67fefca< /gmapID></record>

Jason at Source Graphics is a top-tier preferred supplier for us, and he is our preferred vendor for consumables.  He is easy to reach, and consistently produces results to keep our supply chain on track. He offers personalized service, that is attentive to our needs a small start-up. I cannot say enough for the quality of their service!<//review>

Knowledgeable tech's, great customer service.  We have a wide format printer (HP Page wide 5000)  that we purchased from Source Graphics. They helped us pick this machine.  It fits our needs perfectly. They tailored our maintenance agreement, to fit our specific needs. We save money and our machine is covered. Thank you Source Graphics.< /Review>

<text>We've done business w/ Source Graphics 2 years now where they come and service any of our large format printers that are no longer covered under manufacture Warranty and when it comes to companies that offer this service in this industry I find Source Graphics to be very reliable in terms of coming out when they say they would, very professional they get the job done right the first time and you dont get "run around" or the "blame game" as to why things arent fixed in a timely manner and that is why we are re-committed to another year of warranty service provided by Source Graphics, money well spent!< /text>< pics>

Source Graphics was a pleasure working with. I worked with Hoang Van who was very helpful and knowledgeable in answering my questions in regards to additive manufacturing, specifically SLA. I have done plenty of FDM printing, so I wanted to make sure I was comfortable enough to jump into resins. I was pleased to learn they deal with different types of additive manufacturing as well as reverse engineering hardware (3d scanning). I highly recommend Source Graphics.<//review>

<Review>Good Company and great support. Easily helped me make a decision on a higher end 3D printer Ultimaker S3 for our business and home use.

Got great advice on material selection and support on how to get things setup. No issues with the machine and ordering from their online store is easy as everything ships within 1-2 days.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Source Graphics has been one of the best and most reliable vendors our school uses.  I'm in the role of ordering supplies and materials for our FormLab printers and they are always incredibly thorough, professional, proactive and accessible.  I wish we could order more of our supplies through Source Graphics, it would make my life much easier!  Jason T. is the Supplies Manager I work with and he's outstanding at what he does.</review>

<review>I am grateful for Source Graphics.  I order print materials from them frequently, especially in these crazy 2020 times to produce public information signs and banners for my job.  I have been pressed to get projects done on very short notice and have found myself out of supplies and Source Graphics, especially Jason T have always gone above and beyond to get me what I need incredibly fast.  They've never let me down and make my work just a little easier.  Don't you wish all vendors were like that?</review><name>Nick Buck< /name><GmapID>0x80dcd115c96c4965:0xbe508039b67fefca<//GmapID><Rate>5< /Rate></record>

<Text>After buying the Ultimaker S5 Pro for Source Graphics in December 2020 from Hoang Van, It has been a great experience communicating with them for any little issues we have had. Anurag has been very helpful in explaining any small technical issue that has popped up and has cleared them right away. Jason in the supply dept also has been great in helping with filament needs! Thank you guys so much for great communication as it is so rare these days and super important to us and many others.

I own an operate an engineering consulting firm (Origin Design). I use a Formlabs printer for 3D printing. Source Graphics is a reseller for all Formlabs printers and supplies. Recently, I purchased a resin tank and a liter of resin from Source Graphics for my Form 2 printer. I ran into an issue with my printer not successfully printing a job. I contacted Source Graphics to let them know about this problem and within hours I received a call from Source Graphics letting me know that they have their technical expert looking into my issue with my Form 2 printer. On top of this, Source Graphics sent me a new liter of resin at no charge.

Source Graphics is a quality organization with a fantastic staff.< /review>

Some of the best service I've ever had. Source Graphics has become a great one stop shop for me when re-stocking filament and resin for a Lulzbot TAZ 6 and Form 3 printer. Communication has been quick, ordering is easy, and shipping is fast. Jason, in particular, has been my point of contact and awesome to work with when I need more materials.<//Text>

I have been working with Source Graphics and their service team for many years.  If we have printing issues its' a big problem, and any down time is loss in productivity.  SG is always quick to respond and send out a technician if needed.  They have kept are systems up and running and our stock of supplies full.  I wouldn't turn to anyone else.</Text>

Source Graphics has been our Plotter service provider for over a decade.  They are prompt, accurate and friendly and easy to get a hold of.  As a government agency, our operations are different than private sector and they are always able to accommodate our needs.<//review>

Blue-White Industries has been doing business with Source Graphics since the beginning of 2020. All I can say is that Source Graphics has exceeded my expectations in terms of service and quality of products. Jason has been nothing but helpful and has gone above and beyond in satisfying our needs.
I would recommend any businesses and personnel looking 3D printing to reach out to Source Graphics for their services and products.<//text>

I have only received great customer service from this company from the time of inquiry to maintenance and repairs. the team of people at this company are knowledgeable in the industry and are very  informative. I had the pleasure of working with Hoang Van and he has not only given me every resource that I needed to get started printing, but also during maintenance and repairs, he has informed me of every step and when it was taken. Hoang is very fast with replies which is very important when it comes customer service. Keep up the terrific work Source Graphics. I will be recommending this company to all of my peers.< /Text>

It is very rare these days to find a company who truly cares about customer service, but Source Graphics is one of those gems. Two specific scenarios cause me to write this. The first was an issue where shipping of my 3D printing material was delayed. This wasn't a big issue for me, as I wasn't in a rush for the material, but Jason at Source Graphics proactively offered me a shipping discount on my next order. It turned out to be a good business practice, as I may not have ordered from them again had I not received a future shipping credit. The second instance was more impactful to my business. As a small, startup outfit, funds are tight. So when some of our material was not living up to the standard, Jason again worked with us to make it right and was able to get the manufacturer to replace the material for us. It was a small gesture, but it was something Source Graphics didn't have to do as it was an issue with the manufacturers product.

In today's economy we should all seek out and reward the few companies who go out of their way to keep their customers happy and to make things right. Thank you Jason and the entire Source Graphics team - I appreciate you very much.< /Text>

Im a first time buyer, and had placed my order for resin and tanks which they where very helpful.

There customer service is fantastic, I had a small problem setting up my new resin tank and they help me out no questions asked until my printer was back up and running.  Can't say enough about how the customer service is. Rare these days

Thanks to Lonnie and Jason.

I recently bought a Form3 printer from Source Graphics. I debated buying it directly through Formlabs or through Source Graphics. With the help and guidance of Hoang Van, I ultimately decided to purchase it through Source Graphics since they are the certified local reseller.

During the initial set up, I had some issues with the Tank not being recognized by the printer. Hoang was readily available to help me troubleshoot (even on the weekend). With his help & support, the printer was up and running.

Excellent printer, excellent support! Thank you<//Review>

Will never do business with them again.  No keeping tabs with the customer with your order and broken promise dates and they never reach out to you, to let you know why, besides the covid 19 . I gave a few days after the promise date and nothing. They promise you AGAIN  and days later NOTHING.  You get tired of wondering what's going on.
UPDATE!! Thank you Sy  for reaching out to me and making things right. You have kept close contact and brought my dream into reality.  Thank you for the amazing job on my mask.</review>

I worked with Anurag from Source Graphics to get a newly purchased Ultimaker 5 Pro Bundle up and running. He gave great instructions and advice throughout our initial training session. There was a blockage in one of the material manger feeder Iines and he was able to diagnose and solve this quickly -> helping me to stay on schedule for prototypes I needed to deliver. Hoang Van, the sales rep, was also super helpful. He printed test parts from my files on 2 printers I was interested in and really had patience in helping me to understand pluses and minuses of both printers. Great re-seller to work with all around, highly recommend.</Text>

<text>I have purchased several items from Source Graphics for my classroom.  They follow up to make sure things are going well with the products purchase.
Their customer service is out of this world.  I've called for quotes and got them within a business day.
Every time I had a question about the 3D printer I purchased from them, they were able to help me out.
There are many more examples of awesome support and sales but it would make this review very long.
It's a great company.  You won't be disappointed.<//text>< Pics>

This was my first experience and order with SourceGraphics. I was happy to find out that they had what I needed when my regular supplier was having difficulties fulfilling my order. I was able to place my order online very easily and should see my shipment in a couple of days. My plan is to use them for my future resin needs.

Great place if you have any problems with your 3d printer issue especially Formlab. I had issues with my formlab 2 b printer and Anurag was very resourceful. He was able to help me with my problem and help me troubleshoot right away instead of going through formlabs which is located in the other side of the country.  They also can print your 3d Products in need. Very clean place and everybody was very professional. Thank you.<//review>

Very happy we can be working with you!'}< /response><Review>We purchased a Source Graphics plotter for the company I work for. Efrain picked up our old plotter and delivered our new plotter. He was extremely friendly and kind. There was a bit of miscommunication when the plotter was delivered and it was thought that the old one would be taken at that time. Since we only have the one plotter, we could not let the old plotter be uninstalled on an earlier day than when the new plotter is installed. Efrain said it wasn't a problem and that he would be back to pick it up on a different day. After speaking with our account manager to schedule a time for the pick up, Efrain, once again arrived friendly and very helpful! Thanks a bunch!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><user>104387803583625202706< /user><gmap_id>0x80dcd115c96c4965:0xbe508039b67fefca</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

FANTASTIC customer service and appreciation! Super quick and got everything in stock. We got everything delivered the very next day, but they provide same day delivery, depending on what time of day you submit your order. Would definitely recommend!<//Review>

Really great customer services and quick turn around. My only complaint is that their online purchasing is a little glitchy. Sometimes their system will not accept my credit card in the very last step and I have to start the purchase over or complete it over the phone. Otherwise really helpful staff.</text>

Source Graphics is always helpful from ordering supplies to technical support, they are very attentive and respond to service requests in a timely manner.

Their customer support group is great if you take a picture of the print issue, they can usually troubleshoot over the phone or send someone out usually within the same day.

Ordering from is simple and just an email away.  Just send an email with what you need and they already know which printers you have on site and can place that order right away.  Usually receive items with in 1-2 business days.<//Review>

<text>I've been working with source graphics on a regular basis for a couple years now, and they are awesome! We purchased a large format printer through them, and use them constantly to order paper, ink, and other supplies. They are easy to work with, quick to respond, and fast at fulfilling orders. They've been super helpful even when I've had crazy or rush requests. Definitely recommend!</text></record>

Great service. very responsive. I know they're all the way in Anaheim. When I open a ticket for a scanner in Antelope Valley, they have no issues sending a tech to the site. I've used them also for telephone support to troubleshoot an issue. No problems. They are very knowledgeable on setting up and configuring the ColorTrac large format scanners.<//Review>

We've been buying large format printers from Source Graphics for over 15 years. It's always nice dealing with folks that provide good customer service.
They have a nice showroom in Anaheim Hills with a good variety of large format printers. This is nice so you can see real world print speeds and quality. They have some crazy 3D printers in the showroom as well.
If you're looking for a company that understand the products they sell these guys are a great "Source".<//review>

<text>Hoang came through. Went above and beyond to make a deal happen. Couldn't ask for anything else. The man delivered as he said he would. We have been dealing with SG for years. By far Hoang is a stand out in the team. Lonnie is also great source. Both have great customer service. Thanks Guys!!!< /text>< userid>

We get all supplies for our large format plotters from Source Graphics, bought a plotter from them, and recently added a service contract for another plotter.  Their fantastic service keeps us coming back again and again!!!<//review>

<review>Stopped in to compare two 3D printers I have been looking into for a while. Hoang Van helped us and was extremely knowledgeable about the two printers I was comparing (Ultimaker 5 and Formlabs 3).

So glad we stopped by- we were able to see the different prints from different machines and Hoang was very honest and helpful!

So glad we stopped by!< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

She is always so friendly and takes her time with you.   But to be honest Johelen never ever fails me..        Source graphics is very lucky to have such a dedicated employee as Johelen..< /review>

SourceGraphics has been fantastic-- fulfilling a big order for our research lab at Duke University. Specifically, I'd like to shout out Hoang Van. He's managed to get us a product that was backordered everywhere else-- getting the product to us 10 weeks earlier than what we thought was possible. He's been unbelievably helpful in making the purchasing process go very smoothly, getting procurement documents back to us within an hour. With this kind of quality prompt service, I look forward to working more with SourceGraphics and hope to do business with Mr. Van in the future.

edit:

yet again, SourceGraphics comes in clutch. Shout outs to Lonnie Martinez and Jason Tzintzun. Pure class, rapid responses, just the best. Highly recommend working with them.</Review>

Abel is amazing! Truly has a heart of gold! He towed my car to his yard to keep it safe After it broke down while a friend borrowed it. He even arranged a ride home for my friend and provided my friend and his daughter with snacks and drinks on a hot day.  And when I came to do the repair (change the alternator)  he helped me out of the goodness of his heart. Couldn't have done it without him and will always recommend him. Good people are hard to find these days, but I found one when I found Abel.< /Text>

Abel’s a very great guy and very reliable as well. He towed me on a SUNDAY at 9pm, and if you ask me it doesn’t get anymore reliable than that. Recommended him to all my family & friends. 10/10 every single time.</text>

<review>Abel did a great job! He was a one stop shop with my car. It had been sitting for 3 months, wasn’t running. He came to look at it to see what he could do. He towed my car and was able to get it fixed. He had great quality service even let me know how to service my battery every few months which was great! He explained everything he did for my car and showed me as well. Definitely recommend for your towing and car needs. Thank you so much!</review>< pics>

I’ve never had to call a tow truck until today and I’m glad I called Abel’s. He got to my location right away, kept me updated, and was very friendly. He helped me and my family with our situation. He gained a loyal customer today. Thank you Abel and I will call you whenever I need.<//Text>

<Text>So I needed a tune up last minute , so I called Abel and even though he said he would be able to do it he also was up front that he had other jobs to complete as well. I still was okay dropping the car. However I did not expect my vehicle to be ready in less than 3 hours. I couldn't believe.  Not only is my car running like new, but for him not to make any promises on a specific time but still upfront with other appointments he had to complete,; and then getting my Tahoe in and out within 3 hours, same day, was unbelievable and shows good customer service. You will always have my business just based on the customer service  alone. I will definitely be back for other work in the future. Thank you Abel.</Text><rate>5< /rate><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Abel is professional, compassionate, and a pleasure to work with! He will tell you how it is and would never surprise you with hidden fees or shady business. If I'm on the side of the road, I want Abel to pick me up because I know he'll do a great job and treat me courteously in the process. I highly recommend him.<//Review>

The best towing service! Abel’s towing goes above and beyond to provide SAFE and QUALITY service. My car broke down twice this week including on Christmas Day and Abel’s towing helped take care of towing my car to my mechanic. Both times Abel went above and beyond to make sure me & car were safe. I highly recommend this business!<//text>

<userid>101034480701493340645< /userid><Text>I was driving from Bakersfield to Modesto when I had a fam belt break and the van overheated at 4:30 p.m.  I did a phone search and found Able.  Since there were tow services closer , he suggested I call them since they may be able to respond faster.  I tried a number of tow services and they all said they could not do it.  Able called a while later to see if I had gotten a tow.  When I told him I hadn't, he came out and towed my van to his shop in Reedley.  We got there after 5:00 p.m. and he diagnosed the problem  He told me if he could get the parts, he would fix it right then.  The parts were not available until the next morning, so I spent the night in a Reedley hotel.  The next day he fixed the van in a timely manner, charged me a fair cost and I left.  About an hour and a half later, when I was almost to my office in Modesto, he called my cell to see if the van was running well.  I am SO impressed with Able, his concern regarding customers, and his integrity.  I could not recommend Able any higher; if they gave the option for 10 star ratings, I would have given that to him.

<Text>I had him pick up my Harley Sportster 1200 at my ex wifes house and he was great. On time,  perfetional and was able to get my bike. Pick up went smoothly even thought I had been trying to get my bike from her house for 6 months with no luck. he also jumpstarted my bike and filled the tiers with air. He picked it up at her house and took it to his shop where I picked it up at. I've had bike towed and jumpstarted before. One tow truck damaged my bike when securing it to truck. Another when jump-starting damaged an expensive electrical part. I will always use Able and his tow truck. Very nice and accommodating man that goes the extra mile. Before he drove away I wanted to invite him home for dinner. Felt like a life long friend of mine that I called and he came to help me. Worked with me and my insurance problems. I would recommend him to anybody. More important I would trust him late at night with my daughters.< /Text></record>

<Text>Able's Towing is exactly what I needed in pinch. As a business owner myself I'm hyper sensitive to the ethics of service providers. Able's Towing had great service that was transparent, knowledgeable, and was representative of a great community in Reedley CA. Can't say enough about how Able's came through when I was in a pinch. Economically conscious!< /Text></record>

Got a flat in the middle of Sequoia National Park and didn't have a spare. The visitor center provided a list of local towing companies. The first company we tried complicated the situation and clearly saw our misfortune as a money making opportunity. We then called Abel who provided exceptional service. He was committed to doing the best for us and even arranged for a place in Reedley to stay open and replace the tire. Abel is a man of his word and delivers on his promises. If you need help in the area, don't hesitate to contact him!<//text>

After waiting for over 6 hours for my Roadside assistance to find someone to help us ABL'S TOWING & ROAD SIDE SERVICE took the job and came quickly to help us. He called me to let me know he was on his way to pick us up. He was coueristy and very helpful. He brought me, my husband and my car home safely. Thank you Able for your help.< /review>

<Text>This is my 3rd tow with this man. He is reliable, reasonable, and awesome. He will go above and beyond for his clients. If you call him he'll be there as fast as he can, no ifs ands or buts no matter the time. He won't leave you stranded like some other company's that want to stay in bed leaving you in the boondocks  (alone). I have five kids and an unreliable vehicle. He has driven to Fresno to pick up my husband, drove him back home to Reedley. And after midnight out on the skirts of Reedley where my mother in law stayed stranded. I called Mr. Abel and he was sleeping (of course 1 in the a.m.) but he got up and picked up my vehicle and mother in law(no problem at all)
This man is Amazing and I recommend him to y'all, he won't let you down ,he keeps his prices fair, and his promise to be open 24 hours true. He's a good person  I trust him. Have a wonderful day and stay Safe out there.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

This is the worst place to deal with the rob you for your money. We gave them 500 dollars to look for a car because the car that was promised was sold to someone else. And when we went back and try to get our money back they said no because the invested in another car we never agreed to get..Ruben was the name of the sales man he is rude, lied to us and even had the nerve to hang up on me all because he did not have a valid reason to give me the money back. If anyone knows how to take this to a civil matter please let know and please don’t shop here WORST DEALER EVER!<//text>

Weekend came and you never showed up, then you show up 2 weeks later saying you wanted the red truck. We tell you sorry you never came and we sold that one, as you’re there we bring in a black one that you like. We give you numbers and agree on the price and we agree to work on your truck and get 4-5 things you want done ASAP and only focusing on that truck. We get it ready and call you to tell you it’s done and you show up saying you don’t want the black truck.?? We tell you the loan didn’t go through on the red truck for the other customer and we advise you that you can now have a pick on the red or the black but you say you don’t want anything anymore. The small deposit was to insure you want a truck and we work for you. You would be upset if we would’ve sold the black one to people that asked about it and we lost customers on it too.'}</Response><GmapID>0x808fbf9e775b9671:0x7836347b897eb01a<//GmapID></record>

I bought my 2017 truck there ! They gave me great service and they had incredible staff. They offered really low payments with credit union. I recommend looking at the bay auto for you next purchase.<//review>

<text>Almost 2 years ago I bought a car from this dealership. They took advantage of me they knew I was in a very desperate need of a car and they sold me what ended up being a “Salvage” car. I was a student at that time and I don’t know how they financed me with Wells Fargo. After a few months the car started to develop problems. At first it was the battery which raised my Insurance due to the numerous calls I made to them for help with jump starts and towing, later the transmission failed living me with a big bill for a new transmission. I have spent so much money just to keep my car running but I cannot keep up with the bills anymore. There is always something wrong: Tires, electrical, locks, loose bumpers, etc. This past weekend  I decided to trade this car and went to a new car dealer. Worst time of all this experience! I found out over there that “The Bay Auto Dealer” sold me a SALVAGE car. Since they refused to work with me, I have notified already the proper authorities so they can take action on my behalf. Please be careful and check where you buy your car from! I wouldn't recommend anyone to go to this place! Please don't buy cars here!</text>< Date>

This place is garbage got a 03 ford mustang gt convertible not even 6 months when my ABS light came on my rear axle was all messed up had to get it replaced and my rear window was glued instead of being screwed in. I don't recommend anyone getting a car from this place but if you do make sure you take a mechanic.</review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>(Translated by Google) Really disappointed to buy here I do not recommend it at all! I grabbed a nissan altima that already had a blow, they said they were going to leave it as new, encourage me, but after three months of paying we realized that the blow that it already brought is also internal, just to fix the problem it costs us 1500 we went to Talk to the diller because it really wasn't our fault and they just have us waiting and the one who claims to be the manager “Ruben” doesn't answer us, they don't give us a solution !!! Besides being paying almost double what the car costs since I had no credit 😒 Really be careful with this diller and these people who do not care about the customer !!!

(Original)
Realmente decepcionada de comprar aqui no lo recomiendo para nada !! Agarre un nissan altima qué ya traia un golpe ellos dijeron que lo iban a dejar como nuevo me anime pero a los tres meses de estar pagando nos dimos cuenta que el golpe que ya traía también es interno solo por arreglar el problema nos cuesta 1500 fuimos a hablar con el diller por que realmente no ha sido nuestra culpa y solo nos tienen esperando ya ni nos contesta el que dice ser el manager “Ruben” no nos dan ni una solucion !!! Ademas de estar pagando casi el doble de lo que cuesta el carro ya que no tenía crédito 😒 Realmente tengan cuidado con este diller y estas personas que no les importa el cliente !!!</text>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) The worst place of all to buy cars, the price they have is twice the value of the car, all their cars are dirty inside and the tires are out of air, the cars have blows wherever they want, in their advertising they say $ 500 with good credit, $ 1000 to $ 1500 no credit, and $ 1500 to 2000 bad credit and when you get there they want to ask you at least $ 2500 and another $ 1000 within a month, I spoke before going because I live an hour and a half away and they told me you come with an id, try work, proof of address and with money only for registration and paperwork and as soon as I told them that they still did not check my credit and they were already asking me for a minimum of $ 2500, plus another $ 1000 for a month, what a waste of time

<review>Craving BOBA tea, decided to try the best closest one to me, holy f*KC it’s great, all the reviews are correct, customer service was outstanding, Kenny answered all and all my questions, I got the purple haze (ube and taro) in the largest size, with almond boba and “dirty” coffee shot for my order.  100% full sweetness, as all things should be for sweet drinks like these.  $7 we’ll spent and will have to sneak in here whenever I have free time, Cheers</review>< Pictures>

Discovered this place while we're in the area in West Covina. First time trying their milk teas and I have to say they're pretty good. The wifey decided on the flavored green teas and they weren't as good as she hoped it to be but I would still give them a fairly high rating due to the fact that they're much better than some of the boba tea shops in the IE which we're from. I saw that they have the brown sugar milk tea that's made popular in Taiwan so I would definitely have to try that the next time!< /Text>

This store is un organized. Too many people trying to put out their Boba product,nobody listening to the nice lady who owns it. Kids running everything,yeah into the ground! I make deliverys daily and these kids can't get orders out without arguing with each other on who should have been doing online orders. So if you order from here,don't get mad at the delivery guy,start with the ones preparing the drinks.< /Text>

Nice place to grab a good boba creation. They have a wide variety to choose from or create your own. Our favorite is the 'Sunset Dream' a butterfly milk tea infused with strawberries and a colorful burst of flavors. Also added touch is the boba. Once mixed up it will turn a nice lavender color.  In door seating & parking lot seating is closed. Take out and delivery service are only options available at this time. Hand sanitizer stations located throughout the store. Prices are reasonable and fall into line with most of the other boba lounges. Those bacon waffle fries are pretty tasty. Called 'bacon & cream'. These are waffle fries with bacon , green bell peppers, sour cream and sprinkled with chives. Oh yeah. Can't forget one of those 'sunset dream' boba.</text>

Good variety of drinks.  Friendly workers. Depending on time of day, there might be a line and wait time may be longer.  They do have a loyalty program which you get a free drink after a certain amount of purchase.< /text>

<Review>This is one of my fave boba shops. Always go for the crazy variations they carry. Matcha avocado, cookie monstaa, purple haze, and sometimes just good ol milk tea w/boba. Menu is posted on the door with other types of mixtures. All the combinations keep me going back to try them. The way they mix it's like they actually try them out to get the best proportions. BYOB, name means what it means.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>This is one of my favorite boba spots.
This place is perfect if you don't want caffeine; if you do want caffeine, check out the boba shop on the other side of the plaza.
See their "Inspired" menu if you want their unique selections.</Review>< Pictures>

The boba is decently priced and they have a digital stamp card. I love their popcorn chicken! Always cooked perfectly. Some places over cook them but this place does a great job. Their calamari ones were good too. I once tried the the popcorn chicken with the hottest of seasoning, it was good but wayyy too spicy!! Haha it was the after burn that hurt the most, my lips felt 5 times bigger! Haha</review>

<text>A good time all around! The workers are very patient, kind and helpful. They even had suggestions for me when I was hesitant about ordering! They have a couple drinks that are unique to this shop and taste pretty good. But if you're not big on new flavors their traditional teas are just as good!<//text>< Pics>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Text>Amazing boba and I agree with most individuals that the popcorn chicken and the small snackings they offer are tasty!

That being said, they recently have changed and started using these really slim but tall cups---a bit annoying when I am in the car and the cup is wobbling all over the place. I even had it tip over once but thankfully the spillage was minimal as I just left the shopping center when it happened and was at a stop light. Because of this, I cannot get their larger size---it's too hard to transport home without my worry of it spilling over in the car.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNiZmBnMlJT8djl9anp5TXxxeCKnauBtF-hIs4F=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< resp>

<Review>Been coming here for years (feels like) and this place never fails to satisfy.

Ive been sticking to favorite drink, which is the original 50/50. Their fruity drinks are also tasty. The drinks are served in large cups. That's a big bonus. It feels like a gift, or something special with every order.

The shop itself has the appeal for a younger crowd. It's fairly dark, with lively music playing. However, it's pretty neat environment.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Happened to be in West Covina for a dental appointment l. I was thirsty and in the mode for boba tea. So I looked up Yelp and found a boba tea place nearby with over 800 reviews. I thought it must  be good.

Placed an order through yelp on a Chrysanthemum yea and a guava smoothie. By the time I got to the store inside HK plaza, the order was ready for pickup. While I was there, I scanned their menu and it looked like they some extensive boba milk tea drinks that were not listed in the Yelp order menu. One of the drinks caught attention was the the sea salt cheese top boba milk. This drink is definitely interested but not on yelp menu. This drink is famous in Asia and has been an internet sensation where everyone is talking about it. With a foaming cheese on top of a boba milk tea drink, the flavor of the tea becomes tantalizing to the tongue. At first I didn’t like it. But the more I drink it the more I love it.

This is definitely a place to discover new boba varieties.<//Text>

I've come here a few times and every single time has been a good experience.

BYOB sits in the same plaza as the HK supermarket, and although BYOB can be a bit hard to find, just look out for the market than you will be in the right place. Parking here can sometimes be hard to find during peak hours as all the restaurants as well as how busy the market can get will fill up the parking lot at times.

Now lets get to the review. The inside of the store is nicely decorate, with a few tables in the front and high tables towards the back. They had also recently added some claw machines inside which is a nice plus. There are also restrooms here. The service here is almost always great, except a few times where I felt like it could have been better.

The drinks here are great. I've only tried a handful of drinks though, but they were all excellent. There was one times though where I ordered a Boba Milk Tea and it was way too sweet. I haven't tried any of the food here yet so that is an addition to this review in the future.

Overall, I always find my way back here despite a few instances where I felt like it could've been better. Because of that, I felt like giving it 4 stars would be a more honest rating.< /Review>

<Review>3 for satisfactory, neither good nor bad

Pricing is okay. It isnt expensive nor cheap
Atmosphere is okay. The eclectic design is fine, but metal sheathing takes away more than it adds. It feels most of the seating and tables are foldable, which takes away more, enough to lower the rating.

In the end, nothing stands out as "id come to this place again!" To draw repeat customers. There isnt a significant draw or separation from other drink shops in the area. It does not help that the plaza is maintained okay rather than well. This makes it hard for the drink shop to work, especially when competing with other restaurants offering similar drinks.

On the plus side, they seem to be trying to make new drinks, but they dont seem to be doing that recently< /Review>< pics>

This is my new favorite boba place and I am so sad I don't live in the area. I got their chrysanthemum milk tea with boba, 50% sugar, and it was like sipping LIQUID JOY. I especially appreciated that when I first expressed hesitation about the sugar level, the employees paid special attention to my questions and gave thoughtful answers. Then, when my order was ready, they asked me to try it so if I didn't like the sugar level, they could remake it right away. It was perfect, but I loved the level of customer service. High fives all around, guys.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

It was my first time here today and the restaurant looked great! But as i was waiting in line i noticed one of the workers, a young girl with dark brown curly hair and glasses wasn't acting right with the customers in front of me. When i got to the front of the line i asked her what the sizes were she threw attitude towards me even when i told her what i wanted to order she was so rude and nasty. As i was waiting she slammed things around  including drinks before she gave them out and acted disguising towards other customers. This is a great place but its not gonna get any service with the bad customer service given out tonight.Find someone nicer who is nice to other employees, customers, and cares about the business.<//text>

Cool little chill spot in Hong Kong plaza in West Covina. Customize the drinks. The Bobaristas are all friendly. The drinks are large and toppings plentiful. Food is also decent considering their forte is milk tea and various fruit slushees.<//review>

Okay so the staff wasn't that friendly, and our three drinks took 20 minutes to make even though it wasn't busy. The drink was really good! And I like the chubby cups they use.< /Review>

Today was the first time that I've had their Thai tea and it was delicious. I got it with almond milk and I can say there was no lack of flavor or a feeling of wateriness. It was creamy and smooth. The boba was also sweet, but the texture of them could have been better. It didn't taste like fresh boba, but that was okay, it was still good. Overall, I would go again and order the same thing :)< /text>

The two girls that were working there lacked customer service professionalism. They stood there giggling and gossiping the entire time I stood there while the other male worker did most of the work . when I complaint about the lack of service they didn't acknowledge that I was there til I said something about there service. When I finally bought my drink, the female worker didn't make eye contact wit me or even give a thank you when I left . drinks good. Customer service bad.<//Text>

<text>Yummy boba! My friend who was visiting from out of town wanted legit boba. I knew exactly where to bring her, to BYOB in West Covina. She loved it so much she insisted that we come back one last time before she left the State. Their regular size boba is massive. I recommend their milk tea boba. Their staff are also very kind and helpful.</text>< Pictures>

Bought PopCorn Chicken here twice and both times it was raw. The 2 boys that work there have no idea what they are doing. I was in a rush to pick up my kids so I couldn't go back to show them how raw the chicken was but I did call and asked for the manager. The boy said "She’s not here." I then asked when she will be there. He then said “Ummmm uhhh I don't know." I asked if she goes out there to close the shop, he said yes she’s comes around 8:30pm."……. . I even ask the kid if he knew what the inferread temp of cook chicken was. Again “Ummm uhhh you want to call back later when the manager is here? Okay thank you bye..”
I end up forgetting and not calling because around that time I am putting my kids to sleep. Will I be going back there? Yes, maybe for drinks only. I am just upset because what would of happen if I didn’t check the meat and gave it to my kids? Please hire more experience workers. The two “boys” that were working Thursday Oct 27th around 4:30 are sloppy and careless.< /review>

<review>Interesting atmosphere, but the build your own boba premise isn't all its cracked up to me. It's not necessarily  boba as it is juice balls, not the chewy type.<//review>< time>

<Time>1440144338810<//Time><Rating>3<//Rating><Text>I've tried BYOB twice now, and both time I've left feeling underwhelmed. BYOB is different from other boba shops in that you are able to customize your own drinks and toppings from a variety of assortments if you don't want to order a drink off of their menu.

Upon first glance, it is quite overwhelming as there are teas, toppings, flavors, drizzles you can customize into your drink. The workers are very quick to give you a hand and take you through the process, especially if it's your first time at BYOB. Basically pick a size, if you want it blended or shaken, with tea, milk, flavor ... any drizzles, and then fill it up with toppings!

The first time I tried BYOB, I ordered an almond milk tea and added boba, almond pudding, and egg pudding to my drink. I really like boba and pudding, and I can definitely drink a large amount of toppings, so I asked the worker to pack my cup! There wasn't a set price on customizing my drink, and since I had ordered almond milk tea, I was able to get the drink priced as something off of their milk tea menu. The drink was pretty good, but nowhere near quality tea. I feel like the almond tea tasted pre-made, sweet with artificial almond flavor. The boba and pudding were good, but nothing too memorable.

My friends ordered random drinks and they all thought their drinks were pretty good. I tried the Orange Blossom, almond Hokkaido milk tea ... they were okay, but a little too artificial tasting. Overall, it was a very interesting experience being able to order whatever we wanted. My friend even told the worker she liked grapefruit, and he was able to whip up something that she really liked.

The second time I returned, I tried their Lost at Sea creation, a sea salt green tea, with boba. I had wanted to get the almond milk tea again, but I guess the prices have changed since I've been, and making my own drink cost way more than trying a creation of BYOB's. Lost at Sea wasn't a bad drink, but it definitely wasn't a good one that I'd get again. It tasted sweet, but didn't have any tea flavor. Boba was nice and chewy, but the drink itself was really bad.

BYOB is also known for remaking drinks if you're unsatisfied with the taste. (A good thing, but what happens to all those drinks people don't like!) Unfortunately I was in a rush and couldn't fix my drink. Overall, it's a good concept if you're into building your own drinks and whatnot, but I prefer drinking boba that has good quality tea alongside of it.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80c2d62d9564ad25:0xfb5549049cbaa109< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>I come hear once a month for a haircut. This store is always clean and neat inside and is conveniently located in this shopping center, but the main reason is your employee named Kent.
Kent is always upbeat, pleasant and just a great guy who does a outstanding job of cutting my hair.
I had to wait a few minutes before my turn and watched Kent throughly clean and disinfect his work station after his last customer left, wow, management take note, he is a keeper.</review>< Pics>

We checked in online, got to the location with no one in the waiting room. The next two people who came in were served before us. After 45 minutes of waiting, they let another person (the 3rd) get served before us. I walked out and the lady came after us, she explained that every one check in online (so did we). When we checked in it said it was a 30 minute wait, after waiting 45 minutes and no end in sight, we left. I won't be back.</review>

<date>1605695711637< /date><review>I got what I asked for. But the top was uneven but I didn't catch until I got home. Nobody cuts my hair right, and I leave with hair all over me  no matter where I go. So it was kinda just normal. I still had to go home and fix it. The stylist was friendly and tried. I did feel that 20 dollars was a bit pricey. But I didn't have time to shop around because it was late.</review>< username>

Apparently you MUST have an online appointment now. I sat there for over 30 minutes while people just kept coming in and going ahead of me. At that time of day it looked like I would never get helped. Ended up leaving and found a MUCH better place.<//review>

It's clean, service is nice. The wait can get a little long on Saturdays, but that it so be expected. You can use the app and sign in ahead of time which makes it super easy.< /review>< pics>

<Date>1499895004632</Date><rate>5< /rate><Text>My partner and I came in for cuts as we were traveling through town. We had both been needing haircuts for a few weeks, but we wanted to wait until we could go to a Great Clips because we have always gotten good service through their shops. We didn't check-in online, but we were still seated within 10-15 minutes. My partner was taken care of by Maria, and she did an excellent job; his hair is the exact style he always like to get, and she was very quick about it. My hair was cut by Jocelyn, and I believe she is the manager of the store. I had shoulder-length hair, and I wanted it to be shortened to a pixie cut. She took the style I showed her pictures of and talked me through a few different changes based on my hairline and such. Once she started cutting it only took maybe 15 minutes from start to finish. She is obviously very knowledgeable and talented. I am very pleased with how it turned out, and if we lived locally I would go to her exclusively.< /Text>< pics>

I used the Great Clips app to check in and it really worked.  I was the next person for a hair cut.  The place was packed so was glad I used it.  The hair cut was great and used an coupon from my Vons receipt.</Review>

<rate>1< /rate><review>Myself and son were there when shop opened, waited 15 minutes after it opened for a haircut with no other customer in the shop. Then watched the next 3 people come in and be seated for cuts and we were told it would be at least an hour. After waiting another 40 minutes watching people be seated for cuts, I asked why this was going on.  If they would have explained it was by appointment to begin with we wouldn't have wasted an hour there. Zero for customer service and the fact they were rude when they had to explain it to us.<//review><Date>1474455727576< /Date><name>Gary Statler<//name>< resp>

<gmapID>0x80ea432070036af5:0x41c4b6e7816c4a90< /gmapID><Review>I recently moved to Bakersfield from Los Angeles and wanted to continue going to Great Clips for my hair needs, so found this one on Coffee and Olive nearest to my home. I went in last month and now this month. I checked in online and when I got there about 2:30, they were busy with customers and one of the ladies there, asked me if I checked in online, and I said yes and sat down to wait for my turn. A couple of minutes later, a Great Clips Hair stylist walked in, saw me waiting, checked the computer, quickly set up her work area and quickly called me up for my haircut. I was greeted with a smile and a welcome by Hair Stylist Johanna, who took my info and helped with my hair cut needs to my full satisfaction. Johanna is one of the rare ones that combine barber haircuts with Salon Style care treatment with excellent customer service. Johanna went above and beyond my expectations and anyone's expectations of what excellent customer service and a great haircut stylist should be. She was amazing from start to finish. Johanna listened and did exactly the type of haircut that I asked. She did an an excellent job and I appreciate her attention to detail.  You can tell she has a beautiful caring heart and loves her talented job.  I liked my haircut so much, that I will be coming back to her for my routine haircuts.   So to recap, i got an excellent haircut at a reasonable price, didn't have to wait, and they carry everything I need for hair. Great Clips and their Hair Stylists like Johanna and my previous haircut stylist Maria get it right every time.  I'm not sure why you'd go anywhere else (unless overpriced and terrible haircuts are your thing). I have been a customer of Great Clips for years, can't imagine going anyplace else. I even refer family and friends.  Like with everything else, it's tough when moving to a new area where you have to get situated, but at least I am situated with this Great Clips for my hair needs thanks to Johanna and her amazing customer service and her great haircut and styling.</Review><user_id>106817638967992132985</user_id>< rating>

I go here every time I get my haircut. They cost $15 for most. Not exactly sure. But thars what I pay and I believe all mens cuts are $15. Today I had a coupon and only paid $7.99. I'd reccomend. They also save what you get if you get the same thing every month or two.<//Review>

<Review>Went in to get my hair cut.  3 Stylists, 3 customers.  No one waiting.  Stylist took my name and said someone would be with me in a few minutes.  I waited.  One customer paid and left.  Stylist went to back room to use the bathroom.  Came back and swept up.  Then told the other two stylists she was going out for Starbucks and asked if they wanted one,  She walked right past me and out the door.  I got up and left.  The two stylists stopped and watched me walk out, but didn't say a word.  The 3rd stylist was parked next to my car and watched me walk out, but didn't say a word.  Too bad.  These women don't care about the business and the manager wasn't; there.  She would have been furious had she saw what happened.</Review>< Pics>

< review>
My Garden Café is a perfect place to have breakfast. It has tables, booths and also you can just rest at the bar. The food is wonderful. Very tasty, and the portions are very reasonable to the price. The place is cozy and the servers are very nice. If driving on highway 99, it is worth to get off your way to have breakfast at this place.

I don't know so much about dinner.</review>

Beautiful and quaint cafe with a large breakfast and lunch menu. The skillets are amazing, and portions are generous. Excellent table service. You gotta love the witty sayings on the wall.

Food was fairly good. The interior decor is stuck in the 80s. I feel the atmosphere helps make the meal. I'm being a little generous with 3 stars. Price was fair I guess. It is a break from subway or togos.<//Text>

Good food,good verity of food,good atmosphere, good quality food and good portions of. Prices a little high. Don't let the name fool you. It's not a vegan cafe. They really should change the name. I didn't go in for a long time because I thought it was vegan. Until my pastor took me there.</text>

The diner is cutesy in that overly flowery grandma kinda way and it smells inviting. I originally came to try out the chocolate biscuits and gravy.

I ordered the Mediterranean Omelet with hash browns and the chocolate biscuits and gravy. My fiance had the waffle combo. The service was good, we were seated quickly, our waitress was friendly and our drinks were refilled regularly, but I found the food lacking.

My omelet had an overly large amount of feta in it and my hash browns were cooked together in a large clump. Pretty much like fried mashed potatoes, nothing like regular hash browns.

I was very disappointed in the chocolate biscuits and gravy. The biscuits were pretty standard breakfast biscuits, nothing to write home about, but the chocolate tasted disgusting. It was overly sweet and tasted like instant pudding, which I hate. My fiance's bacon was also pretty much jerky, way too chewy.</text>

I couldn't finish my hash browns because they were saturated with butter and too rich. Orange juice isn't fresh. Be warned that if you opt for biscuits and gravy instead of toast, you will be unable to finish.

But the wait staff is fantastic. Attentive and friendly, our waitress had learned all of the desires of the ten-person group of regulars I was visiting--down to knowing how to split the check up 5 ways without asking.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Text>This is by far the worst breakfast I have had since being in the Army in 1969. I ordered my eggs over easy and they came one broken looking like an egg sandwich, my hash browns were raw.They forgot my wives hash browns. I thought the coffee was very good, they were not busy and being a Ripon resident I try to support my local vendors but that would be way beyond reasonable expectations.

I call 20 mins ahead and it took them 40 mins before it was ready. I called today the lady asked me to hold on and sat the phone down and never returned! I waiting 15 mins just to have the phone record. Customer service is awful when it comes to calling in. Best food around  but bad service when trying to call in for an order.< /text>

Awesome self serve and automatic car wash options! The automatic gives you a choice of touch free or brush or a combination of both.  The self serve bays have all the usual gear plus one bay that allows you to wash the top of your tall vehicles as well - great for work trucks!
The equipment and the lot is very well-maintained and shows a definite pride of ownership.
Steve says - whether you need a quick onto go car wash or do you want to take your time this is a great location to do both.</review>

Only quickly rinsed my car down, after hitting the stop payment button which said $3.00 charged with no receipt option availuable, it charged me $15, there is no way to contact this company. I will be reporting this to my bank.</Review>

As always  Cartoon Carwash is clean and everything is working properly. The young man that works there always sees that his customers are satisfied  with their carwash. I love going to a place that is well taken care of, like Cartoon Carwash.< /Review>

The food was delicious! Everything was full of favor. The service could have been a little.  We had to constantly ask the waitresses for refills, they forgot our tortillas and hardly returned to our table to check on us.< /review>

Now, we just got home from a fabulous Mexican dinner for two!
Service was fantastic.  Food even better (if that's possible).

Salsa & Beer (in our opinion), IS BACK!< /review>< Pics>

I only gave 1 star because I wasn't able to give zero stars me. Went around my birthday with friends and the service was terrible. I got a asada burrito and asked for no beans but they ignored me and added them anyways. When I informed the server about the issue I was given an attitude and was made to wait longer for another burrito. Once I got my order again it was different meaning it was WET this time which was confusing because the burrito I got before wasn't. When I informed the server again she argued me down saying that it was wet before and I was wrong. They server then asked what I wanted her to do about it with a major attitude. Short story don't eat there service is not equal to everyone that eats there!!!< /Text>

Good food and easy parking. Although need to hire new team members or staff or train the current ones better because when visited, it was terrible.

My first 3 star.< /Review>

<review>I went and placed a Togo order at 6:25, simply order: 2 asada tacos, Spicy bean burrito and a chicken torta, Mr. Pib and a Michelada. And Ramiro tells me 15-20 minutes. 35 minutes later I get told that they “ran out of bread” and it will be 3 more minutes. I take it home and go to open my torta which has Chicken Torta written on the container and I pick it up and it’s Asada. So I’m a little upset but I take a bite and I cannot chew this meat because it is SO fatty! Ruined my appetite and ate a couple bites of salad. I have tried the 2 newest Salsa and Beers that are both in Vanowen and I will not go back to this one. I couldn’t eat my dinner and it really upset me. I will wait in line for Sherman Way anytime!< /review><pics>None<//pics><user_id>105777363502715596263<//user_id>< gmap_id>

<Text>This new location is a hidden gem! If you know about the one located on Lankershim, you know that it's always packed! There is always a line and never any parking. This location is located very close to it and is equally amazing! The food is consistent with their other locations. You also cannot beat their pricing - it's so reasonable! They have an on-site parking like Lankershim, and because not everyone knows about them yet, there's always parking available. The staff here is extremely helpful and friendly. We ordered our food inside and waiting in our car. They brought our order out to us, which I really loved. I can't wait for this pandemic to be over so I can see and enjoy the ambience - the inside of the restaurant is beautiful and I can envision it with a mariachi playing on the weekends. Great restaurant with great prices!</Text>< pics>

We were a family of 7 all living in the same household but because of covid they separated by us which i find kind of weird being that at other salsa and beer restaurants they sit us together.

Also they don't have their liquor license yet so their drinks kinda suck!? Jk< /review>

<Text>My friends and I came here today to pick up our food. We placed the order over the phone and then went to the place to pick it up. It's a new location, so there wasn't a lot of people there. We saw that they set up a outdoor dining area in the parking lot if you want to dine over there. I got the 4 carne asada tacos but I was really bummed out it didn't have pico de gallo on it. The orange sauce also wasn't spicy so my taco was just okay. My other friends got their order dishes which they really liked.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMsCXF84tw30FX7IXNnt-SytNiVBqFAoM0DYZIa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMTzU5U2c56x5nj02JNyajL2c1O52xzA45XmZFl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDdHyF90-5nTU9suN2thNBwr9df4t0H6t4gfT0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMulVbgX38YRt2T5RHssbfBqK72Rx4bXLHSEmn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXcmUHvKf93YXJMdMw54EkeDH_dpzg8_sjTLq7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJYIsRbRFUlbELJHqVWelI81GgOLKsvRwYJxIN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4Saw6gpPmoL6LqpbN-HIEIEVlzX3JlG9mi45a=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwFCua_mhK_go80VoTNRI2tGR9ACgms8QM7KX7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< resp>

< Review>
This is the most recent location that has opened in the San Fernando Valley. I ordered a chipotle chicken salad. Yum. My spouse ordered the fajitas, which tasted a little differently then usual, perhaps due to covid-19( limits on seasoning?). Seating outside only the wait wasn't bad. Service is still great.</Review>

I went to this restaurant last week..! Horrible place for drinks, I ordered a Margarita it had no alcohol so I asked the waiter to make me another one the same result so No thank you I would never come back here it’s ashamed since I live in the houses around here..! I paid full price for my drink that I did not enjoyed at all</review>

This is a very nice Shell gas store/Market. Gas, drinks, snacks and many other things. Hungry?  They have three places to eat at here. Subway, Chester’s fried chicken and Countryside home cooking, hamburgers and Mexican food, including breakfast items, eat inside at dinning area or get it to go.
I ordered Subway, ham and egg on flatbread, it was pretty good.< /text>

I used to love , love the burritos here .. I pass through every 3 or 4 months and would definitely get one. The tortilla was real thick and soft, I'd never had anything like it. Breakfast , lunch or whatever burrito you got they had these one of a kind tortillas... Crazy good.. until today !! 😞Past through and got a pastor burrito... Standard , run of the mill tortillas.. it was good ... But definitely not like they were... Please go back to the way you used to do it... The ones that were made special and with extra love... If you do I will come back .. if not I will do my cholesterol a favor and keep going<//text>

Noticed my cars tires needed air. Decided to stop by at the she'll before I headed home. Very suprised as I walked in. Very big store they have a little seating area to eat inisde, you can pumo gas, or enjoy a meal. The store is clean and well kept. The employees greated customers as they walked in. So obviously I didn't have $1.50 in quarters since the air machine takes only quarters. Went inside purchased some drinks and as I asked the cashier for change in quarters, She asked if it was for the machine I said yes and said she would turn it on. Thank you so much, highly appreciate it.</text>

A very spacious and well organized convenience store and gas station which also features an interior mini restaurant. Gas prices are a little too high, restrooms weren't very well kept, but store was in good order with sufficient inventory.< /review>

This Shell's bathrooms were ok clean and kept up like most gas station bathrooms, unlike the rest stop bathrooms that are usually very clean.  Pumping the gas is the same as every Shell.</review>

Today was the worst experience I’ve EVER had at this chipotle.
Let me start by saying there was absolutely no line and only one person ahead of me when I walked in. When I was asked what I wanted the gentleman told me he had to go in the back for the cauliflower rice. Everything looked like it was sitting out ALL day!
The portions were so small. I asked for two dressings on the side and never got them. When I asked if everything was in the bag the lady told me yes and that was a lie. I got halfway home and realized my dressings were not in the bag. So I went back in. When I got there three of the employees were chatting.
I sat there for a good few minutes before I had to say excuse me for help.
It was so dirty in there I will never go back to that chipotle.< /text>

Easy ordering plus they actually give you a good size bowl and don't skimp you like most other Chipotle's. Always a easy 5 stars when visiting this place.<//review>

<Text>Loved the food, it all tasted great,, although chips barely had any flavor.
.y issue was with the staff.. the girl was very skimpy with the guacamole which cost an extra $2.50.  She scooped it up on a big spoon , then knocked about 75% off of the spoon and gave just enough to make a dollop in the center of my bowl.  I also bought a large side of chips and asked for 3 containers of sour cream (for the chips and bowl)...she only filled each little container 1/2 full....which wasn't enough.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

This Chipotle is not worth going to

Because the floor was a bit dirty and some of the tables had food crumbs on them. Staff was like staff at other Chipotle restaurants, more focused on the food and the portions. They can probably be more attentive to the customer to enhance the Chipotle experience.<//Text>

Food prep area was a mess, very chaotic and not organized. Staff didn't even attempt to give eye contact. Upon addressing the young lady on my choice not one did she even acknowledge. The younger gentleman es waiting on her and she just stood there... not sure if they were understaffed or she just needed to rest. My order was finally fulfilled but oh so sloppy. Not very appealing nor appetizing. Will not come back here again.< /text>

< review>
Working at a local hospital and needing dinner for my shift... The delivery was a soggy carton bowl that smelled like urine. Granted I ordered late at 930pm through Uber eats. The food got to me at 1030pm. The order was missing key ingredients and no calls to me were placed to let me know. I realize covid has thrown everything into turmoil however quality should still be a priority. Free delivery shouldn't warrant poor quality. You should call to let the person ordering know if your quality will be less than expected.< /review>

<text>Today I was overcharged $2.10 for guacamole I did not order. Did not notice till i got home when i was inputting my receipt details for my rewards.

Service is hit or miss at this location. One time they didnt have fajitas (i almost turned around and left), and depending on who serves you, you can either get a large amount or small amount-definitely not consistent. I wish i can go elsewhere but this is the closest location by me.</text></record></dataset><record>

Burrito the size of your Palm, they have no rice and they didn't hear you order at all. And no Chipotle sauce. There are more complaints than customers that go through.</text>

I am a Chipotle regular (and by regular I mean I go about twice a week) and this is by far the worst location. The tables and floors are covered in food and trash. All the trash cans were overflowing. I love chipotle’s carne asada, but this place made it so bland! On top of it all the staff was rude! Take an extra five minutes and drive the to one on foothill and day creek so you can actually enjoy your meal.<//Text>

<review>The service was slow for how many people were working this day. But they tried to hurry at least. So not the friendliest staff I've seen but maybe they were just too busy? The chicken bowl I got was tasty. The salsa was medium spicy which I like, not too hot to not enjoy the food. The chips however were the worst part sone had no salt and some had waaay too much. So I had to wipe some of them with a napkin. The lobby was clean, so that's good. I would try the place again just to compare experiences.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><user_name>Jason Huerta< /user_name><response>None<//response>< time>

The steak burritos need to be cooked better. I only come to this location and I've been here only 3 times (for lunch), in the last two years. All 3 times, my steak was not cooked all the way. Didn't finish my food bc I felt sick. Hope this location gets better.</text>

<text>I love "Chi-Potle" but unless you ask for extra rice or beans it's pretty skimpy. The staff is always kool. The food quality is good. Even though they have had all those stories in the news, I've never had a problem. I always get the burrito bowl with white rice, pinto beans, corn, cheese, steak and a bag of chips. It's a little pricey but over all good. If you have not tried it, give it a go. You might like it. I go there about once a week. So I must like it to some extent.< /text>< pictures>

NARCISSISTIC PERSONALITY DISORDER: one of several types of personality disorders — is a mental condition in which people have an inflated sense of their own importance, a deep need for excessive attention and admiration, troubled relationships, and a lack of empathy for others. But behind this mask of extreme confidence lies a fragile self-esteem that's vulnerable to the slightest criticism.

Symptoms
Signs and symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder and the severity of symptoms vary. People with the disorder can:

-Have an exaggerated sense of self-importance

-Have a sense of entitlement and require
constant, excessivExaggerate achievements and talents

-Be preoccupied with fantasies about success, power, brilliance, beauty or the perfect mate

-Believe they are superior and can only associate with equally special people

-Monopolize conversations and belittle or look down on people they perceive as inferiore admiration
-Be envious of others and believe others envy them

-Behave in an arrogant or haughty manner, coming across as conceited, boastful and pretentious<//review>< pictures>

<review>Considering the fact that Chipotle is trying to fix their brand after all those people got sick eating their food, you'd think they would up their game in the customer service department. Not at this location at least... very rude, inefficient team here. two people were working the counter while one was outside sweeping leaves. I thought they might've been shorthanded this day, so I gave them another shot but nope! Different people, same level of disinterest in their customers. If you must have Chipotle, just go to the one at the Gardens.</review><Rating>2<//Rating>< name>

I must admit I only came here because I got that coupon for the FREE FOOD with no purchase necessary. With Chipotle in the news so much with poison food SO often, the truth is I was a bit nervous fa real.
But yo I can't even front, food is quite good, yes fresh, natural, makes you feel good that it's on the healthier side for fast good.
I can't believe no Mexican hot sauce! No Tapatio or that one that starts with Ch. They have Tabasco! Which I like too, but not really on Mexican food.< /text>

We go to many chipotle places and I've tried some good and some bad ones. Yes, it's possible that it won't taste the same! We came here and I swear it's delicious! It tasted amazing, and shout out to the girl making the burrito bowls, she really hooked it up, not just for me but for everyone! I hate when other chipotle employees don't do spoon full! Great!< /Review>

Despite occasional minor misses, this is one of the stronger Chipotle locations I've seen over the years. 90-95% of the time they meet the high standards for freshness & quality that this chain is known for.</Review>
