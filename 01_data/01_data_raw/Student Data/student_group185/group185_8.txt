<review>Scam artists. FTB is trying to charge me $14,000 I don't owe. They can't prove that I owe them, and we're in the middle of the dispute whilst they're garnishing my wages and because of them I can't work and at risk of becoming homeless... This building needs to be raided. They're bullies with authorities with leaders closing their eyes on how they operate.< /review><Time>1602318456480< /Time><rating>1<//rating></record></dataset><record>

<name>LSJ h</name><Time>1580863626258</Time><review>I just recently became more acquainted  with the FTB. I'll keep this short. We owed over $23,000 in back taxes. We sent a cashier's check and thought it was complete...until we received a call saying they never got the check. What?! So we had to cancel the check (which costs us $25 non-refundable from FTB) SMH.
Finally we refused to send via mail and asked if there was another way? Sure! there's an office DTLA. Went DTLA paid for parking, went through security, made my way upstairs and they wouldn't take the check! What?! Left and went back another day....finally got it done. This is ridiculous.
Working THIS hard to pay FTB? Sad.< /review>< user>

<UserId.>111607397149070302077< /UserId.><review>I got a notice from my place of employment in 2017, informing me their records showed, I owe for a fraudulent tax return from 2009.  This is a completely faulty claim, I make no attempts trying to guess how this error occurred, I have NEVER worked for a bank.  Which according to this claim the person responsible for this case, if there is one, worked at Bank of America.  After my employer notifies me of a withhold wages notice, I call and am directed to their website, told to print a letter form to send them.  The response to my letter was they couldn't find a case of fraud and I am responsible for this incorrect or false case.  HOW can I be responsible?  Why am I responsible for proving who I AM?  WHO decided to ignore my TRUE statement about never working at a bank, never making a tax return using these facts and THEREFORE not owing them $1,149.  HOW IS THIS LEGAL??  They have now taken action against me and put a hold on funds in my bank account.  So, I'm being punished for something I didn't do, had no knowledge of up until 2017 have not been able to reach a living person to figure out what to do next.
If anyone knows of what I should do or if anyone is in a similar situation please reach out to me.

*after emailing the executive supervisor I received a phone call from an assistant or something and after a week or so a response by email, secured email. So I’m not allowed to discuss what was in the email. Needless to say it wasn’t an apology and a refund.
So I did some research, this company is completely bogus. There’s a thing called the right to Contract. If you don’t write these people back they decide for you that you’re agreeing to their terms by not voicing opposition. This isn’t a right it’s a scam.
Also if you don’t file for taxes or fill out a w2, w9 or other type of tax form, if you don’t use the social security number they assign you, then you’re not agreeing to be subject to their unconstitutional taxes.
There’s a National constitution and a state constitution, both put a limit on how much we’re allowed to be taxed 7-10% per annum, straight across the board! In the 50’s a family of 4 paid about 2% of their annual income to taxes, today it’s about 24%!! Apparently the thing to do if you’re a company is to, become incorporated with the United States Corporation and fool people into giving them money. 🤬

An error made by them and unbeknownst to me, I had a levy for 2012 state taxes. I didn’t live in California that year! In total it cost me $1000. for a $300. judgement. And honestly, it was easier to just pay the damn fine and move on. It would’ve been such a headache to prove them wrong. The state of California is corrupt, right to the core. This is government at its worst.<//text>

FTB Agent very knowledgeable, courteous, and helpful. We arrived just around 0805, and were helped right away. We were able to resolve our issue and obtain information for future FTB business concerns.

we have paid our tax on time according to our bank statement we paid two months earlier than due date but we got charged penalty fees, Very funny,

<Review>Why is it 5:30 pm and I am still on hold from an automated "CALL-BACK" that originated at 5:10pm on a Friday evening???!!! Now, NO ONE has more patience than me because I have been a Special Education Teacher in an NPS school for 16 YEARS!!!! I do not understand this incompetent process that has left me infuriated for the second consecutive DAY!!! I made several failed attempts to reach this office on 8/18/16 between the hours of 11am-2:30pm and the automated system would take me through all of the "stalling" preliminaries to eventually abruptly end my call with a message that simply states that my tax dollars are not worth an individual assisting me and "to call back at another time!!!! Today, the automated system gave me an option to hold for 3 hours or to leave my name and number and that I would be contacted in 1-2hours and 15 minutes!!! Well, the call back was l;ate and it originated after this office was OBVIOUSLY CLOSED!!!!</Review><Rate>1< /Rate>< username>

YOU DO NOT BOTHER TO ANSWER LETTERS OVER 12 MONTHS- YOU DO NOT EVEN CASH OUR CHECKS OR NOTE PAYMENTS. YET YOU SEND ENDLESS LETTERS THREATENING WITH ATTACHING OUR PROPERTIES.
WHY SHOULD US TAXPAYERS  BE PAYING FOR YOUR NON-WORK IN CAL. STATE OFFICES? YOU AR E A TOTAL DISGRACE.< /Text>

It seems that there letters are always of an urgent matter, but when you have an urgent matter - it does not seem so urgent to them. Does that make sense or is it just government. Most common misspelled words is GOVERMENT or is really spelled GOVERNment? We have all forgotten that the word GOVERN is part of the word government.

Govern: verb (used with object)
1. to rule over by right of authority:
2. to exercise a directing or restraining influence over; guide:
3. to hold in check; control:

YA - that's pretty much sums it up.< /review>

<Text>This is a government run organization.  Technically we are paying them with our tax dollars but they sure as heck don't treat you that way.  You are a nuisance to them, a bother.  They suspend an LLC without notice.  All I wanted to do was revive it.  I wanted to PAY them.  What did they need from me?  I have no idea because every time I call, I don't even get put on hold.  The automated phone system hangs up on you because there is a high-volume of callers.  Put me on hold for 3 hours, I can do that!  When you hang up on me time and time again, I don't know what to do.  When you DO get a hold of them they tell you how to revive your LLC, so you follow orders like a good little girl and they still suspend it.  So you spend a week and a half calling them until you get a human on the phone who tells you something COMPLETELY different you need to do to revive the LLC.  "I don't know who you spoke to, but they were wrong.  This is what you need to do."  So like a scolded dog, with my tail between my legs, I follow orders!  Is it revived?  Oh no it's not.  Why?  It's still a mystery!  Third time's a charm? (we are in month 4 by the way at this time)  Nope.  So I somehow get in touch with them by the grace of God and I STILL have more things I need to do to revive the LLC.  So I do them.  They're done!  REINSTATE THE LLC PLEASE!  JUST DO IT!!!  Nope, it's still suspended. Are they messing with me?  Is this a joke?  Where's the camera?  I speak with my CPA asking him what the heck to do!  His response, "The Franchise Tax Board?  They're a joke.  They are extremely inconsistent.  I've been dealing with them for over 30 years and I never know what to expect."  My therapy session is over.  Thank you Google, for letting me rant.< /Text>< date>

The contact number leads to an automated system that will not connect you to a person. As does every other phone number connected to this office. The online chat put me in a line for couple of minutes and then ended the chat automatically for apparently no reason. If I have questions a machine can't answer, where am I supposed to go to get them answered...? This place is completely useless.</Review>

<Review>Clean Friendly service fast and efficient ordering. Ap, Store, Associates are not one in the same. If the Ap experiencing issues it's not the associate job to program edit the ap Store issue behind the counter. Work with the associate to over come the challenges. I went back to the basics and ordered from the menu above the associate. Got my food as quick. Gave the store a good review because Ive ordered & never had issues with the store. Associate it's a hit and miss but overall awesome. Associate prepared the food with pleasure and I was out the door no problems. Associate today are awesome.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>Unfortunately this location was out of Meatballs, jalapeno bread and hadn't made any cookies to go with the free cookies when you purchase a meal as thr trays were not even out. They also didn't prepare any of the fresh juice that they advertise which is nice when for people trying to avoid Soda.

I think it's important to mention that I didn't go in between meal times as my visit was at noon. sandwich I did get was good and my overall experience was positive it's just too bad I had to settle for something completely different than what I wanted. :(<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNCI_xotrI318c3g99a4vDa0DnOJ_hJ86C1aat=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

Mgr Josh has a fantasy crew working with him. Josh himself can put together one heck of a sub. We always feel very welcomed each time we visit. On our last visit, we had our subs made by Ana, if you're lucky enough to have her made your sub, I guarantee you will be very pleased. She made our perfect.< /Text>

The sandwich artist Mariella did a great job on asking us for what we preferred on sandwiches.  She took her time and did not rushed us. I appreciate that kind of service.< /text>

Jokingly say to the girl with no name badge "so they got you working all by yourself at lunch time?" no she says....they have other things to do before they go home. Wow. More important than your customers? Yup. Apparently so. The sandwich was good though so 1 star.</review></record>

Nooo 10 X .... seriously. This sub way don’t have anything they use to have a lot of types of breads. But this store doesn’t.. also they never have avocado or guacamole ... they always are missing something like creams ... seriously is not subway standard. .. they should care more about the product that they are selling</Review>

< Review>
I called in ahead to order six sandwiches, and they refused the order, that they would be too busy in an hour. I said i don't need it now but in an hour and a half, they still said no, only if it were one or two sandwiches. Its ridiculous for a business to refuse an order. Boo on them.</Review>

They constantly gets account information messed up and they fine you for their mistakes; they don’t give you any notice and even their customer service have no idea what’s going on, good luck running your monopoly business until everyone moves away.<//Review><user>113735285570918471550< /user>< pictures>

I honestly don't know how you all sleep at night. The "solutions" you have come up with to make us, your FORCED customers suffer, due to YOUR lack and shortcomings is appalling. The responsibility is with YOU. Not US. Voluntarily shutting off our power should be illegal. OR I should have the opportunity to switch companies. You failed. You continue to fail miserably.< /review>

<time>1608856240750</time><Text>SCE wants people to invest on solar and backup batteries to get you off the grid. That way you spend your own money to pay less and they do Nothing. The problem is when I paid $49,000 on solar panels my break even was 13 years. The price then was 13 cents a kilowatt, this year they raised the price to 27 cents a kilowatt. So in essence it’s going to take me another 7 years to break even. Now they are pushing people to buy backup batteries and to get off the grid for 5 hours a day.  It’s only going to cost me $24,000 more. My break even  is 18 years. They are doing this by turning off your power for any reason, supposedly to protect us. If I did this they would lock my rate at 15 cents a kilowatt. The problem is that between now and then they can raise the price again and again.
There should be a civil class action law suit against them for the loss of life, goods, time and services that we pay for and can not use for their abuse of the consumers. Nothing but well connected CROOKS!</Text>< Name>

This electric company shuts off electricity to our upstairs a/c unit every time it is over 100 degrees which has happened more than 10 times this summer!! we try and put the a/c on only when needed and we have solar that provides energy for their underserving  grid. Yet they now plan on building thousands of new homes and apartments in the wash off Sand Cyn and they can’t even support existing homes!! If the city can’t get local utilities to supply adequate electricity to existing homes then maybe they should consider NOT approving cheaply built homes in the area with NO infrastructure being added to the already overcrowded 14 freeway and water facilities..the city of Santa Clarita is clearly not representative of the Awesome town they claim to advertise</Review>

That is unacceptable, especially when a good amount of people are being forced to work from home during COVID. Is this because you haven't invested in your infrastructure properly? I understand not wanting to be sued, but why wouldn't you go to the source of the issue and correct it? In the past you've been sued for wild fire damage, well looks like loss of wages is next. How about we stop putting a Band-Aid on a broken leg and calling it a day. Ridiculous!<//text>< pics>

Does edison know every single time they decide to turn off the power people lose thousands of dollars worth of food?
This establishment is disgusting to say the least...how about instead of turning off the power once or twice every month they update the infrastructure 🤔 just a thought.
Thanks for making me throw away food and be unable to work from home. Not to mention turning the power off in the middle of finals week... Thanks a lot 👎<//Review>

Disgusting excuse of a company. They could not care less about our safety. They care about not getting sued and having to pay. If they cared about our safety as they so claim, they would have updated the infrastructure long time ago. Instead, the corporate greed has them pocketing all the profits and overselling electricity when they clearly cannot keep up with the supply demands. Immoral, unethical, pathetic, revolting.</Text>

The WORST Ever!! Horrible service and customer service is non existent. They claim these psps are for safety yet neighbors in my complex 200 ft away have power and we don’t. It’s clear they are only worried about their liability. Such a joke and it’s happened at least 6-7 times this year.< /text>

Good customer service; the two people I spoke with were knowledgeable and patient when I started to get a little lippy, however I have never in my life had an Energy Company ask for my Social Security Number, W2s, and a $155.00 deposit. It's not right, and I'm not paying it. Also irritated I have to set up my service 4 days before I need it because you apparently can't transfer service on a weekend, and you consider black Friday a non-workable holiday. It's not even a bank holiday.< /text>

If I can give a negative review I would-   For the past 9 years Edison had mixed mine and my neighbors account number.  So we essentially were paying for them and they for us.  We realized this mistake when they shut off my neighbors power-  which in terms was ours.  After going thru representatives, they realized it was their mistake.  This was 11-20-2019. We are now in February have yet to hear from anyone in regards to this.   My husband have spent numerous hours on the phone to connect with different supervisors yet no one has any answers for us.  “Your file is under review”.  No immediate contact information, just waiting on the phone listening to elevator music, and at the no substantial answers.  I wish there was another electricity provider that’s where I would be right now.   If this isn’t resolved we would need to eventually file a law suit, which is a waste of our time and effort.  We have paid our bills on time, why aren’t they crediting us back in a timely manner.  I wish I can go on for 3 months without paying their bill, no late charges, no shut off powers.  I’m so frustrated, I’m ranting on a google review.  🤦🏽‍♀️< /Review>

It was predicted 102° today and they didn't cancel it and didn't get it back on by 4:30pm. Not only could we lose part of hundreds of dollars of fridge/freezer contents, sit in sweltering heat all day but in the past we have lost appliances which were plugged in when the power failed.

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Has to be the worst power company on Earth. Power constantly goes out and they tell you they've replaced an upgraded all the equipment but then the power goes out even more after that. And God forbid if you want to run your air conditioning in the middle of summer they put you on the top tier and gouge the hell out of you, but they never even give you any kind of a credit our anyting when the power is completely out. There like the DMV of power company's, supper inefficient on top of horrific customer service, what a great combination. 👍< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80c27e018067ce71:0xe02890f04398abc5</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I've been trying to pay my bill online for the past 2 weeks and there's always a service message saying that there's a problem and to check back later. I do NOT want to use the telephone service because they charge you extra even though they lie and say you don't pay extra by using your routing number, they do. They have idiots who work behind the phone who give mixed and false information. I heard that you don't have to use them so I am searching for other energy companies and will post which one's are better on here later.</text>< pics>

<text>Not happy. We went on your summer savings plan and there must be some sadist working the controls. Why is it that only on the very hottest days of the month you kick off the air-conditioning?  I have company and it's 93 degrees in my house at 8:00 pm. I'm not seeing the point in this "plan".</text>< user_id>

From the start the service was EXCELLENT. It’s really hard to find good service anywhere nowadays. They knocked it out of the park, they even shined my tires! The price was great and I will be using this tire shop from now on and will refer all my friends to them.

OPENED SUNDAY !  I received two replacement tires and the gentleman was extremely friendly. Even helped me jump my battery as the car had been sitting for two weeks. It was towed to the location. Thank you FIVE BROTHERS !  Keep up the great work, friendly honest service, and fair prices.  They don’t make em’ like they used to. Truly a diamond in the rough. God Bless you all !</review>

<text>We were in town on business delivering a vehicle for our client when we noticed that we had a nail in our trailer tire. We searched for a tire repair shop close and this place was near with what we thought would be a big enough place to park our truck with the trailer. It was a tight fit but we backed in and got situated. Jerry and Hector immediate assessed what we needed and began helping us get our tire repaired. We came here for 1 service but these guys are great. While repairing the tire, we noticed a disconnected axle brake wire. We asked Jerry for tools to repair the cut and they help us get that repaired. Next we noticed that the trailer needed welding repairs to an axle support bracket. Jerry brought his welder over and repaired the issue. We had a blown fuse and attempted to help us get this repaired but they didn’t have the one we needed. We came for 1 service and received 3-4 services which save us time and money. These guys are super friendly and go above and beyond to help you resolve your issues.  We highly recommend this shop for your tire repair needs.<//text>< Rating>

Came fully prepared to replace a tire that kept having low tire pressure. Turns out there was a small nail in the tire. The guy that helped me out insisted the tire was good and should only be patched. I paid $20 for a patch and went on my way. Thanks so much!</text>

< Review>
So I come outside of school today and see my right rear tire is completely flat.... hearts racing and feeling soo overwhelmed... the tow guy comes and says I can still drive my car after he puts air in it, they point me to Five Brothers Tire &CO which is literally 0.1miles away from school. I get there and immediately Jerry is super nice, helps me out, doesn’t try to sell me another tire, or try to sell me anything, he’s honest and tell me that my tire is still really good, noooo being pushy here at all. He also shows me where the tire pressure requirements are for reference which is on my driver side door and took the effort to explain everything to me!!!
Jerry just gets straight to work, patching my tire, and within 20-25 minutes he comes back out and only charges me a small fee of $15 that I would was happy to pay! I would definitely recommend this business!!!! Thank you !!!<//Review>

Very knowledgeable and helpful. They give you several different options based on your price range instead of pressuring you into something. I'm definitely going here in the future for my tires!</text>

< Review>
Lack of professionalism. Company isn’t responsible. This store alone made me switch to Verizon, because T-mobile lost my iPhone package twice. And has still yet to refund me. Instead of ordering a new iPhone, I ended up ordering a nightmare. Switching to Verizon was the best decision I made after the nightmare experience I had. The only staff member I’ll credit is, Shaffin. He helped me to best of his extent. His help was very much appreciated, but it still doesn’t excuse the company from being irresponsible & terrible at their customer service & their shipping/ordering department. Shaffin himself should apply & switch to Verizon. T-mobile doesn’t deserve him. Overall T-Mobile puts the T in Trash.
Make the switch today y’all!</Review>

First they went paperless, now they've taken the payment machine out of the store. Now that they don't send you a bill and you can't pay and leave, they want you to give them I.D. to make a payment. This must have been their plan all along. They OBVIOUSLY want your identification. I don't want to give these people my I.D. just to make a payment! Looks like I will have to start looking for a new carrier.</Text>

Best customer services I have experience by far Brain was very helpful and patient did not feel rush whatsoever. If you are looking for someone honest to help you out ask for Brian he will explain to you everything from top to bottom I felt so happy leaving the store, Great Job Brain I'll be sending all my friends and family to you location. Also thank you for the tips in surfing in Laguna :) #superFunny #supernarly #Sprint</text>

Great staff at this location. Came from the Norco store off hamner about as pissed off as can be. Nothing but kindness and unconditional assistance at the crossings location. They should all become trainers for the hamner/norco location. Highly recommend this store (crossings), super nice and competent staff.<//review>

<Text>I was promised LTE coverage at home for the 5 lines and phones I purchased. They also confirmed LTE coverage for my place of work.  At home we get 3G at best and I'm stuck in 1x all day at work. It's so bad text messages won't come in until I leave work.  They said I can use they booster at home but I must have wifi for it to work.  I have to reply on my homes internet to use sprint's network?  Their coverage maps is made up an not accurate.  I have asked a dozen times if I can leave but the only way is to cough up $2,000 for termination fees.  Thanks for lying 🤥 to get me on board a sinking ship 🚢.</Text>< time>

<response>None</response><Review>Most of the time when I order online the pizza is made close to the way I want it. This time was a real disappointment.  Extra sauce was closer to no sauce.  All items on the pizza beside olives were sparse even though one item was supposed to be double.  At least the dough was baked ok.< /Review>< UserId.>

<Text>I love the supply chain process of Dominos, always fast and easy to order online. Unfortunately, this specific location does not allow for custom orders such as a topping on top of another or special requests citing that "this leads to customer dissatisfaction" even though I, the customer, said would be OK with the sequence of toppings layered. Now I have to travel to another franchise a couple of minutes further to get my pizza craving with a franchise that is more sensitive to critical to customer satisfaction.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80c2dca87a4ba595:0xb3d5e147b78c8b67<//GmapID></record>

The staff were super nice here. I was picking up a very large online order from here and the staff was super nice about having to bring out about 25 boxes of pizza.  One of them even recognized one of my friends that cane to helped and didn't give us any trouble about bringing a rival,pizza place's warming carries.< /review>

Pizzas that are on a promotional discount are not as good as when paying full price... cheaper promotional offer should not reflect anything negative as YOU GUYS NEED TO REALIZE, when we get a$20 for $9.99 carry out deal, you guys better make it the best damn pizza you can....because corporate is taking a 50% loss to promote a better pizza, RIGHT? Cause it WILL leave is craving and coming back for more. Come on team, I'll change my score to 5 stars If my next pizza isn't so dry and short of sauce or chess or toppings.<//review>

Overall have had an enjoyable experience ordering delivery from this location. Delivery time normally ranges from 30-45 minutes and the food is usually fresh, warm, and delicious.
1-star is deducted for some (not many) deliveries that were delivered not the freshest or a little later than expected</Review>

Expect to get unwanted toppings accidentally (but nearly every time) on your pizza. Also, this is essentially a credit ONLY location. It doesn't matter if the order is small, medium, or large, they somehow never have change.  There are definitely much better locations. If you have that option, take it.<//Review>

They forgot parts of my order, the driver said he would go and grab it in his car and come back, and never came back. Why lie? And also no refund was issued. If their workers are this shady I wonder what they're doing with credit card info...< /Text>

It honestly baffles me how this store has 4 stars. I ordered the other night; a simple cheese bread and deep dish pizza with a few sauces on the side. When the driver shows up, he doesn't have my cheese bread. He tells me that it's no problem, he'll call the store and have it delivered.

After waiting another 20 minutes, I call to check on the status of it. The driver NEVER CALLED THE DAMN STORE! So I speak to the manager, she takes care of me and for the trouble she asks what kind of 2-Liter I want. I tell her Coke and feel good...for a moment.

Finally, when my cheese bread showed up, the driver handed it to me, expecting a tip and throwing an attitude at me because I already gave it to the driver the screwed up in the first place. Whatever, I sit down to realize they sent me a BOTTLE of Coke, NOT a 2-Liter. Really? Why would you say one thing and do another? Are these people high? I open up my bag of sauces and lo and behold, it was the wrong damn sauces.

I've worked in a local pizza shop FAR less equipped than a chain store like this and we would put them to shame with how poorly and  sad this store is run. I will be doing everything I can to never order here again, nor have anyone I know order from here again.<//text>

<review>If I could give zero I would. This place as well as the rest of the generic pizza joints is horrible. Bad customer service, messed up orders for carryout etc. Tonight's order was really bad, all of the toppings on one side. The crew seems cheap, one loud mouthed chic with way too much make up on stood out. She had her 2 children on the job with her while she gave attitude to customers, the kids sat and waited for their free pizza no doubt. I'm giving up on eating out, too many "adults" with issues that can't get the simple job done right.<//review>< rate>

I love ordering pizzas from this location. I simply put the order online, specify what I want, and it is delivered within 40 minutes or less.

The whole process is made simple and efficient, and the staff (which I have never met outside of drivers) seem to have their stuff together.

<text>your delivery was not to long, and not to short. The gentleman who delivered my pizza was amazing, he had such great hospitality, I really appreciate that. Besides that the pizza was amazing the wings were perfect and the lava cake delicious as always. This is why I choose dominoes over pizza hut. Sincerely order #586000<//text></record>

< review>
Hueman is a horrible Manager called and tried to blame me for delivering pizza 45 min after is was ready even though I only like a couple blocks away, he proceeded to tell me it was because I didn't answer my phone, when I never rang, and I was waiting in front of my place the entire time, then hung up on me when I asked about what he would do to make it right.</review>

This is a great place to eat. This was our second time visiting this restaurant and the service here is great. Fist time was for breakfast and the second time was lunch. So worth the drive and price. Portion of the plates a huge...</review>

Can't believe I was able to find a regular home town restaurant that was open for dine in. I had the steak and eggs and I enjoyed everything as well as everyone in the waiting staff. Will definitely return next time I get back to ripon.</Review>

<review>Awesome place for breakfast or early lunch.
Affordable, clean, fast service, quality food.
Took a little longer to get seated than they expected and there was no where to sit to wait inside or outside. Drinks came out fast and early, food came out hot and fresh but took a little while and didn't come out all at once.
Overall we will definitely be returning as soon as we come back this way.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeq9JhJUCff29WAjLkI7CLfy-Ju_jWWNfJxVu9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxudHL0QAHMUzIsEyGIUCyWLk_lUv8VK-RigJ5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjlYnDUS0BMlk-ycjU89h-2RpHBQq79IyOrG9b=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Date>1577650725574</Date><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

Have eaten there several times these past two months. Food and service is very good. Service slows down when very busy but that’s understandable.< /Text>

<text>Just recently moved out here to ripon and have been dying to try this place. We finally did just now and maybe just an offset day but I was not impressed. I ordered the eggs Benedict and they overcooked my eggs. I let the waitress know( who is very friendly and gets a 5 star for service) and the kitchen sent out a little bowl of two very over easy eggs. I felt like it was his way of saying "f you". Were already eating outside so food is already getting cold and you send me two barely cooked eggs to throw on top of my now cold rest of the benedict? I'm no gordan ramsey...  but I'm sure that should have never left the kitchen like that.</text>< username>

last night was our first time we went to this magnificent restaurant. But It is absolutely not the last time. We enjoyed the evening very much with the courteous service, with the fine cooking and wine and with the comfortable payment. We will surely return there again.<//review>

We usually get the same thing and never really deviate from the norm. There is a reason for that however. It's because what we get, is always good. Call is creatures of habit but I like to say, if it ain't broke, why try and fix it. Service is always very nice and it's fairly priced to boot. This area doesn't have many options when it comes to food, but it's nice when you can find something you truly like and don't mind going back to constantly.< /Review>< Pictures>

Gram raves about this place constantly. Have to admit the food was great. Veggie omelette and hot cakes hit the spot. Price was fair and service was prompt and friendly. I'm noticing a much younger crowd than Frank's so probably the new side of town here. Definitely will add this diner to our list of regulars. You get a lot of food for your money.< /Text>

We have been looking for a good breakfast place and decided to try Country Skillets in Ripon. This place did not disappoint. The food was very fresh, tasty and the portions were good size. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive.

My wife had the Farmers Country Skillet. I was told it was tasty and there was plenty of food. The Biscuit was really good. It was served with a side of gravy. Nice flavor for the gravy. I had the Denver Omelette with Country Potatoes. I wish the potatoes had a little more seasoning (just my preference). We will definitely come back here again.

It can get a little noisy but that is ok. Don’t come here expecting a quiet environment. It is located close to the sports park so there are large groups that show up between games.<//review>

Very polite and considerate staff. Food was delicious and quick surprisingly even though there was almost a full restaurant. Will definitely be coming back here! Somewhat of a hidden gem off of Ripon/Jack Tone exit.< /text>

It wasn't too busy for brunch as we walked in and got a table right away.  It was a clean place and very well decorated.  The service was always timely, my drink was always full.

I would definitely go back.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Amazing food! Such big portions. If I had to critique our experience, it would be that our table smelled of harsh chemicals. The dining area was immaculate though. There was only one server, lizette was her name I believe & she was healpful, attentive & extremely nice. I hope during a rush, she has help on the floor. If not, service would be very slow. Overall, was well worth the the trip. We will be going back for sure.</Review>< Rate>

<review>I recommend this place but make sure it isn’t very busy because some of the waitresses are rude. Except Nicole she was SUPER nice even though it was extremely busy.The reason I’m giving it a 3 stars was due to the rude waitress LIZ, the way she talked to my young sons was very rude, and the fact that she took someone else’s order prior to ours knowing we had been waiting much longer than them was very unprofessional. Liz didn’t bother to check on us once, I have never felt so uncomfortable at a restaurant before but Liz made it a real unpleasant one!
Other than that We did enjoy the food, and Nicole was very professional and nice, she was the reason we did stay. Thank you Nicole for making me and my family feel welcomed!!<//review>< GmapID>

B-Day Breakfast with my wife A+
The food was properly prepared, a good value and very fresh and tasty.  We will be back for sure probably even this weekend. 😊
We highly recommend the French toast eggs and potatoes.< /text>

<review>Service was quite slow. The food is alright. They definitely weren't skimpy on the blueberry topping for my waffle. My bacon was cold and my fiance had to wait a few minutes for his food, instead of serving both of our meals at the same time.

Tried this restaurant for the first time this pass weekend.  Have to say this is our favorite breakfast location.  Large portions and friendly service.  Will travel from Modesto to eat here.< /Text>

I paid over $100 for overnight shipping a week ago. No one is responding to me or offering a refund or offering a tracking order or anything. Starting to think they just scammed me.< /Text>

Always love these guys. Great deals and not many shops let you order online then pickup on store on the way home for the same price, score!  Loving my vape and new juice, thanks!</text>

<review>City of Vape has been excellent. When I couldn't get any company online to send e-juice to Michigan because of our ban, they helped me get American Made Solace Bold Tobacco which was allowed by law. Since the ban was released, they helped with an order of Solace Creamy Tobacco my favorite and sent me 3 extra Solace e-juices for free. Great customer service.<//review>< Pics>

<Review>I put in an online order last Thursday for some juice which normally retails in the $30 range which they had for $5. My package shipped within what I would consider a reasonable time for a smaller outfit (Tues/Wed). I received everything in good order Saturday, with a hand written apology for the delay in shipping and an extra tube of juice gratis.

I'll definitely order from them again in the future.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Crooks.AND NOBODY SPEAKS ENGLISH.Bait and switch tatics ties your money up.They sell you something,call a day later after charging your card saying they dont have that item and try really hard to get you to buy something else.Avoid them or buyer beware.< /Review>

Mr Gokul is amazing. Very knowledgeable on all the products he sells and for a a very fair price.

I ordered an e-liquid from City of Vape a MONTH ago and it still hasn't arrived and they've ignored my emails. It's been in "pre-shipment" since mid November and at this point, I don't think I'm going to get it. They charged my card immediately, never sent the product and ignore me when I reach out asking where it is. Now I'm going to have to go through my bank to get the money back, this place is clearly not professional. I've had orders from China get to me quicker</review>

<text>I cannot give my review on a specific product as it’s been extremely difficult for me to even get the thing. Customer service is awful. I had an issue with confirmation of my age. I called twice. One time someone answered but didn’t say anything, the other said the call could not be completed. Then I go to find an email to which they don’t have. They have all social media accounts but no email? I found a place on the website where I could message someone (I don’t know who I messaged but it was an option for help) and I get a reply claiming they “had been trying to contact me”. Lies. Now my package has been delivered somewhere that is not to me and I highly recommend not ordering online from these people.<//text>< Pics>

<review>Great prices, great selection and great staff and customer service.
This was my first order, but there was a glitch in the system and a problem with my order as a result, but after contacting them they made everything right and even compensated me with faster shipping and a extra bottle of vape juice. I will be purchasing the majority of my vape supplies here from now on.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

(Translated by Google) The service of this place is really excellent, I love buying in this place, they are always attentive to satisfy my needs and although I buy online they have never sent me something that I do not like, thanks for all the attentions and their excellent service, I will keep ordering because It is the best store I have found so far and I will continue recommending it to my friends.

<review>I'm not really sure about how the other Kaiser locations are handling their patients during this pandemic. I do know about this particular location. They know what they're doing. I feel more at ease when I come here. The staff are friendly, and very helpful. I was able to find parking, go through screening, pick up meds at the pharmacy and be back in my car in less than 10 min. I can't speak for everyday, but every time I've had to come here, I have not had to do any unnecessary waiting in line, and they really do practice social distancing correctly. Everyone should follow their example. Keep up the good work.</review></record>

I didn’t need glasses till around 3 years ago, and I went to 2 different local kiaser vision offices years ago before I found this one. Between the super friendly staff that greeted me at the door, to the folks I worked with when I came it to get my glasses replaced, as well as continue to get them adjusted frequently. Willam Q. was my last Optometrist, I couldn’t ask for better help with my fitting. Everyone there is top notch, and I would rather wait however long to get an appointment here, than a faster one at any of the other local Vision centers in this same area.<//Review>< Rating>

<Text>I am so offended by the treatment of the security at the door of this facility which might be because of they are told to do by their bosses. I went to this place for the treatment of my one year old baby but refused to get in the facility with my wife. They might say they are for the safety of us from the pandemic. Though I explain them as a parent I want to be there for my baby treatment to speak with the doctor as a patent we both are equally important. This is such foolish rule that should be implemented as soon as possible.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1595429236667, 'text': "Hello, and thank you for your review.

I have been to the doctor office 3 times for a throat infection. Kaiser not once did a culture. I was told this last time to take a tylenol pill for my pain. Kaiser permanente won't give tests but will prescribe medical even after I said the last time I took it made me have heartpalpitations and I had trouble sleeping afterwards. Kaiser permanente also like to give you surveys asking questions about your personal business that has nothing to do with your medical condition. I wish they were more concerned about their patients health.<//Text>

First time visiting this Kaiser facility. I was very impressed with their update decor. It was well organized and very clean. The staff was very helpful in directing us to the correct office to complete our journey here. Most of the time most of us dislike going to the hospital....But i felt very welcomed here.</text>

Check in and getting called in was real quick but waiting for Dr. Douglas Carmen in the room took 1hr 1/2 . It was almost as bad as going to urgent care. This is ridiculous especially since i had an appointment made for my son. From now on I'm just going to wait until i can get an appointment with the Torrance facility who is quick.</text>

Great for disabled! 5 steps from car.
Best prices on certain items!!
Staff are excellent-bar none.
They carry most essentials: milk, eggs, cat food, even fresh bananas, etc. & many emergency items for flu & fever.</Text>

Pretty busy in the morning when we got there, but wasn't too bad. Went for x-ray & teeth cleaning. Everyone is so nice there. Spent about an hour in total there. There is a limit of how many people are allowed to sit inside the waiting lobby. All in all great experience from the last place we visited.</review>

This was my first time here and I absolutely loved how they took care of my daughter's teeth. The staff there was really nice and helpful they made me and my daughter feel special. They sang for her so she can calm down, they gave her a toy, and they acknowledged her. My daughter tends to not like the doctors or mostly anybody touching her face but I know that after she was excited to learn about her teeth. Thank you so much to the all the staff here, they were really great, and would definitely recommend this to anybody looking for a dentist for their little ones. These guys are awesome.</text>

We've been coming to this Dental office for year's. Today, Darlene was our Assistant. Darlene is a wonderful and very professional  Dental assistant. My daughter wasn't feeling too well after having her teeth cleaned due to a medical condition. Darlene was attentive and was very concerned. She took great care of my daughter.  She's amazing!! The staff is pretty awesome here, but today the service of care  was above and beyond.< /Text>

I have always had a great experience with this dentist. They take great care of my 4 year old. She definitely gives them a hard time due to fear, however they’re always so patient, kind, and gentle to her! Highly recommend this dentist.< /review>

I loved when my daughter was seen. I was a new patient. Guess what, now I am an existing patient and cant not schedule an appoinment until 1 month or 1 1/2 months in the future. But their schedule is open for new patients. Unfortunately a sales practice, care about bringing new clients.< /review>

The child is the patient and they care for them as should. They are patient, understanding, calm, and meet child’s needs. They are also not pressuring if the child isn’t comfortable or too scared they don’t just insist they take their time and proceed with the best options. Thank you for making my sons experience not a scary experience!</review>

<Text>We love the staff, from front desk to the dentist, everyone is super friendly.  My kid is not scared about going to the dentist.  However, I wish the wait could be shorter or that they could have us wait in our car (during COVID) and call us when they are ready for us.  We waited in the waiting room for 20-30 mins with 5-6 other families for a annual check up, I wish we were given the choice to wait in the car.<//Text>< Pics>

Appt was at 4pm. I was told to get there at least 15 mins early so we arrived at 3:45pm per THEIR request. Didn’t get seen until AFTER 5pm. I understand appts run late but really?  No one could give us a heads up?< /text>

This dental center is an excellent place for a child to have most possible pleasant experience with “tooth doctors” in his/her childhood. Prior to visiting this place my child acquired phobia of medical personnel and “rubber gloves”:) in her earlier experiences at a hospital, and as a result was having extremely reactive responses toward any doctor unfortunately:( But all personnel at Kid’s dental fun Zone appeared so professional and empathic toward my child that we had all the necessary procedures done and left the place very happy. One RDA whose name was Jasmine worked with my child for half an hour almost like a child psychotherapist; same did the doctor; I couldn’t be more appropriative! Clean, caring, friendly and professional environment for children’s dental needs. I would highly recommend any family this place!< /review>

<text>We had our initial check up on December 15, the dentist assessed that my daughter would need to have a baby crown extracted, sealants and 2 cavities filled. They said they need to have preauthorization from my insurance, which could take up to 3 weeks. My insurance authorized everything after 1 week. I called to make an appointment for the treatments and could not get a hold of anyone, for weeks. Left messages, sent emails, the phone was never answered. Finally in the end of January, nearly 6 weeks later, someone answered the phone and we made an appointment for 2 weeks later. The day before the appointment, they called and texted me to confirm the date and time. When we showed up to the appointment, on time, the admitting clerk told me they had our appointment for 3 days later. She was completely unaware of the appointment which had been twice confirmed the day before. She told me she would try to fit us in.. my daughter had not eaten for 3 hours as they advised to do so for the procedure. We waited outside for 25 minutes until they finally called us inside. Complete inconsistency and incompetence in administrative and scheduling, I only give one star for Dr. Kang, who performed the procedure and was great with the treating my child.<//text>< gmapID>

I can’t say any more wonderful things about the team at the dental fun zone in eagle rock. Polite, friendly and really talk to your children with care. Explaining all the steps for them, making them feel comfortable and allowing them to feel the instrument to diffuse any anxiety they might have. We have had different people assist us and the professionalism is across the board.<//text>

<Text>The staff was very friendly and professional. I’m happy to have found a conveniently located, quality dentist for my 4 years old.

AMAZING! I would highly recommend it to anyone. My brothers also bring their kids to this office. Their staff are all wonderful employees, great customer service, easy to talk to, feel very welcome and clean place. Jasmine made my son feel comfortable and not scare. Thank you Jasmine for working on my son. WOULDN'T trade Children's Dental FunZone in Eagle Rock for any other dentist office.</review>

Hadn’t been here for over a year and was reluctant due to Covid-19. I made sure to call in advance and ask what precautions they take. I was told they don’t book more than 5 patients per hour and also you can wait in your car until they are ready to call you in. That made me somewhat comfortable and we went. I called from the parking to let them know we had arrived but was told I need to go knock on the door to check in and do temperature test. I asked if we could do that when they were ready to see us and was told no. So we went and a girl came out to the parking asked for name and did the temp check, meanwhile 2 other patients came. I asked if we can go to car and wait but she said they will call us in soon so just to wait there in front of the door in the garage. Ok... we waited....2 other patients came and then another one... by now we were 7 or 8 groups of 2 so more like 15/16. Some were being called in although they had come after us. So the party was outside in a closed garage and my blood was starting to boil. I stepped further away and was finally called in.  I was asked to fill out some paperwork which took me less than a minute and told them if it would take long to be called in I’d rather go to the car and was told no. So we waited in the waiting room another 15 minutes. I got really upset as nothing was as they had told me. The outside waiting is just for them to protect themselves with no care that they are gathering groups together in a garage and the 5 patients per hour was a lie as at least 15 patients came for the same time slot. Their so called organization is useless for public safety and we won’t be going back.<//text>

This dentist office is by far the best I’ve been to, personally and for my son. They interacted with my son the entire time to make sure he was comfortable and confident with the visit. He didn’t even bother<//Text>

However, I was concerned for the lack of instruction provided to my son on how to brush his teeth while having braces when we first started coming here almost a year ago. We haven’t been able to come in due to Covid-19 and as a mother, I tried my best to assist my son with his dental hygiene. Mind you, I’m no expert. Today, after I brought up the fact my son’s gums were inflamed and how I tried to help clean them, was I instructed how to properly assist him with the appropriate technique in brushing his teeth, the length, and amount of times this should be done on a daily basis. Had I known this before, my son’s gums would possibly not have been as bad as they were today.<//Review>< GmapID>

<Review>Was referred by a friend and made an
appointment for my toddler. Some staff were robotic but it's understandable. But the dental tech Carlos was super pleasant and did his best to make sure my kiddo feel like it was an exciting day at the playground. Their prices are great and such a fast in and out. Plus the waiting area has fun games for children.<//Review><Rate>5<//Rate>< Response>

First, i had to correct the spelling on her name and you still spelled it wrong. Second she wasn't seen today. I will give a second review on my next schedule appointment if she is seen on the next appointment.  Wasn't a good experience.

<Text>Not happy at all, I arrived with both my kids, because I don’t have anyone to watch them. My daughter had an orthodontist appointment and I wasn’t allowed in because it’s only one child and one adult. Had they told me this on Monday when they called to confirm the appointment, I would have figured something out. The lady that came out was not professional at all, had no empathy at all. It’s worse, the orthodontist didn’t even come out to talk to me, the same girl with the attitude can out to give me the info. I have never been disappointed like I was today. They did not value my concerns and were not apologetic, she walked away as I was talking to her as well.<//Text>< pictures>

One of the best decisions I have made was going to Dr. Shake at Cdfz. I was referred by a friend after complaining About kids dental Place and I was informed that I should Go to Dr. Shake l. She has been one of the best doctors I have ever met.  The place was Extremely clean, everyone was professional and caring. I recommend everyone to go to children’s dental Funzone and never ever step foot into kids dental Place I myself have  gone to both Glendale and Van Nuys  and I will never go to those places again. I appreciate everyone at CDFZ. (Side note, she got taken care of many cavities, extractions and crowns by iv sedation).</review>

The doctor was great and very gentle with my son who has had a lot of dental work in the past and is a little traumatized. The hygienist  Jasmin was so fantastic and did a great job with my son and depending time with him about what needed to be done and explained what was going to happen and explained all the tools and let him touch them to calm him down.

Also, I was told my daughter had 2 cavities a a week ago and when I came today they said she had four.  Not sure where the miscommunication was.  Urg!!!

<Review>This place does wonders! My son is 5 yo and hates shots, but they managed to give him three times. Dr. Mejia is great and joyful! And you can’t forget about Irma, who was a great assistant to Dr. Mejia. A dynamic duo! (And Edward also) Only plan to see them.

<Text>I would give this practice a higher rating if they didn't 1) ask you to sign consent forms electronically, sight unseen [the verbal summary they give you does not cover every clause that you are blindly signing] and 2) if the office manager and the corporate HR person understood the law better and didn't insist that I sign a consent form that clearly gives them the right to use restraints, even though they were telling me verbally that they wouldn't do it.

Our appointment was delayed 90 minutes, as I 1) asked for them to actually print the consent forms for me to read and 2) went in circles with them to let me amend a consent to exclude the clause that gives them consent to use restraints.

After repeatedly speaking to a manager and the corporate HR person, they ended up doing the written amendment exactly as I'd asked.

That said, the procedure of extracting two teeth, that were painfully blocking two others from coming in, went quickly and very smoothly.  My son said he didn't feel a thing!  Dr. Mejia and Virginia were amazing with him.

So, aside from playing games on the tablets in the waiting room and watching a movie in the exam room "for a billion years" he really enjoyed the visit!<//Text>< rate>

Staff was very friendly, polite and courteous. Front office was welcoming and X-Ray technician was very informative and friendly. Rita was great but Dr. Janjik was short and not very courteous. She was highly recommended and we were excited to meet her but she was more concerned with another patient and rushed us out.</text>

Love it already! They paid so much attention to detail, took their time with my daughter(4yo) to explain everything to her about what was going on, what they were doing and how it was going to happen. I know for a fact we found her permanent dentist (at least until she’s 18) :b can’t wait to take her back for her 6 month checkup, she loved that they had a fish tank, iPads to play on, colorful walls, and gifts she could pick from at the end.</Review>

This place is the best! My little ones (3 and 4) love coming here to get their teeth cleaned and have their check-ups. We’ve been twice now, and Estephania this time, and Julio, last time are incredibly talented with children, and compassionate, and really good at what they do! My kids look forward to coming here, because they love playing with the toys in the waiting room with the other kids, and I trust the dentists, who are also talented at working with children and families.

The only drawbacks for me can be the fairly long wait, and that they’re talking about doing X rays on a 4 year old, every 6 months. We declined x-rays and the dentist confirmed they’re not necessary yet, but it feels like we’re going to be scheduled for them and it’s going to be ‘a thing’ every time.

Other than that though, I can’t fault the facility, and all the people who work there, are amazing.

Oh and they have great toys for the kiddos after their appointments!<//text>

The staff were very nice but the wait time was ridiculous. We got there at 2:45 for a 3pm appointment and didn't leave until 6pm. Just for a simple cleaning on a 2 year old that took all of 15 minutes.< /Text>

I love coming here. The girls are so nice and my kids just love being in the environment. Today my son and daughter came and even though my daughter was a little scared they made sure she would be okay and showed her what was happening before doing anything. Thank you guys for always having nice smiles.< /Review>

The wait is a little long but so worth it. They are so gentle and good with children. I didn't feel rushed when my 2 year old was too scared, we were able to bring her around with patience and different strategies. We have been twice and we will continue to come to this dentist!</Review>

Staff and service was perfect. Only con is that they took a long time. Appointment was at 11:30am and I wasn’t called to the back until 12:25pm.. other than that! I definitely recommend this dental office</text>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Review>The staff here are extremely friendly. We’ve never encountered any issues with the staff. The facility, however, is extremely chaotic. This place overbook their appointments so a routine x-ray and cleaning that should take no more than 20 mins, actually takes about 40-45 mins. We had appointments for 8:30am and 9am for my kids. We barely made it out of there at 10am. Be prepared to wait. The waiting room gets packed. Granted, this was on a Saturday morning but we had appointments. The staff are constantly running around going from patient to patient. Even when they were in the middle of working on my kids, we were told to wait while the hygienist attended to another kid.  We’ve been coming here for years but this last appointment really opened up our eyes and made us realize that we need to go somewhere else now.<//Review>< gmap_id>

I have to start of by saying that my daughter is 3 years old and is afraid of any doctor or nurse. When we went to Children’s Dental Funzone she was excited to play outside in the lobby but the minute she got called in she started to cry and get worried. The staff was amazing I mean amazing in calming her down and making her comfortable. Carlos was incredible and because of him my daughter loves to go to the dentist now. He is amazing with kids.< /text>

<text>This is a good place for kids,  frustrating as a parent.  They over book. The place is packed wall to wall with waves of kids and unhappy looking parents.  I'm one of them.
I bring six kids to this place.  I try to book their appointments together to make it convenient.  But they make it inconvenient by seeing my kids one at a time.  They want to squeeze us all into one corner,  keeping us waiting while they warehouse other patients on the other chairs they could be using to get us out quickly.
But if results is your only concern,  this is the place.</text><response>{'time': 1556649527776, 'text': 'We here at CDFZONE we work hard every day to insure that our patient’s needs are being met.

< Review>
I’m changing my review because my son has selective mutism, emotional disturbance & general anxiety and they have made us undergo various appointments without explaining  the procedures thoroughly. He was supposed to get gassed but we weren’t informed he had to be on empty stomach. They rescheduled half of the procedure. The next appointment they advised they couldn’t perform the procedure. That dentist contradicted two prior opinions. I was told upon performing that procedure that he’ll likely undergo more treatment on that same tooth as time progressed. But to have wasted our time by scheduling a procedure not once, but twice and to be turned away the 3rd visit is frustrating. He had anxiety going in, i had to prime him and help him co-regulate before all appointments. Not to mention that I missed work twice in one week for the procedure they advised he needed but afterwards  declined to perform. Also, they didn’t explain the gassing process and what to expect. Instead the office manager attempted to justify the end result by making assumptions without having spoken to the two prior dentists. Also notes don’t truly reflect what’s communicated to parents–it’s ambiguous to say the  and misleading (they input they advised of root canal, which they did for future-however office manager manipulated notes saying they advised me of current need of root canal). The office manager was focused on covering themselves rather than be understanding and supportive towards finding a solution and apologizing... Guys, I lost two days pay and I’m the sole financial provider. My son needed ample support to make it to the appointments otherwise he’d shutdown completely. I’m truly disappointed to say the least. Now I must pull him out of school when he receives 1:1 behavioral support and counseling. He’s in a special day class which only means he’ll be missing a large part of instruction. Consistency and increased opportunities is essential in his academic and behavioral growth, now I’ll be pulling him out of class to  yet another opinion, though 2 of 3 at Dental Fun Zone opined he needed that  What is also frustrating is that I was initially referred to there by his primary dentist.

Prior review:

This place made him feel comfortable; staff treated him excellently. I most appreciate how they treat children like individuals by interacting with them instead of referencing the parents when making inquiries. Although my son spoke to them in a low tone, he felt comfortable enough to reciprocate in the conversation. They explained the whole process to him as well.<//Review>

The staff and dentists are very friendly. It is the best place for children. In my experience with my daughter of only 4yrs old, if she starts crying the staff knows how to control her by showing her how are they going to work with her and by telling her that it is not going to hurt at all. The children feel like family and they love Children’s Dental Funzone.< /Text>

Amazing service, staff provide great and courteous service to our children. They are gentle, approachable and make our children feel comfortable.

When children think about dentistry work, it's easy to feel overwhelmed and scared; however staff at the Eagle Rock location seem to have mastered the technique to keep children coming in for their appointments.

Dentistry office is a bit hidden in a commercial building, but easy to locate in the second floor. Signs will guide you to the parking structure.

Look them up; several offices all around LA city,  Montebello, Covina, Fontana and more.</Text>

I picked this orthodontist because he was in my insurance dental network and was near our home.  The ratings on Aetna’s dental site are misleading.  The reviews for the orthodontist was for the dental group he was part of, not for him specifically.  The three stars are for our experience with the technicians and the doctor.  It would be lower if just about the doctor.  The dental technicians are fine, but I regret selecting this doctor.  Barely interacts with me or my son.  Does not offer a lot of information if you don’t ask.</Text>

My boys love to come to this place; even though it’s a dental office. All the personal that work here, they really love what they do for living. I would highly recommend you to bring your little one here because they have the best staff and they will make you feel comfortable when your watching your child getting work done. You will walk out of that office 💯 person  satisfy ..< /Text>

My kids love this place and more importantly my husband and I do too! They are patient, kind and extremely professional. One of my sons has autism and they do a great job making him feel comfortable. They take what can be a tough situation and make it much easier all while taking great care of my kids teeth. I highly recommend.< /Review>

< Review>
So my daughter is traumatized from going to another dentistry. She kicks and screams and gets crazy. This place took the time to talk to my daughter, plead with her, that it wasn’t going to hurt. They didn’t treat my daughter like she was just money, but an actual person with feelings. I see a lot of bad reviews about how long they take, but I beg every parent (from experience), let them take their time to do a good job. Don’t go for a rushed job where your child’s teeth end up falling out and getting infected (which happened to her from past dentistry). I love this place and won’t be going anywhere else. Let them take their time, it’s your child’s smile on the line.< /Review>

< review>
The staff is always wonderful, but unfortunately I had gotten there about 10 minutes early with my six year old, who had the actual appointment, along with my 2 year old and my 87 year old grandma. We had to wait almost an hour for the appointment to get started. They did give us a private room for my daughter's cleaning, but it was a long wait, plus I had just broken my toe that morning, so it made the wait that much harder. Over all it was an ok experience. I do feel they stacked the appointments too close together which resulted in the long wait; the waiting room was packed. A few less booking would make a big difference. But again....the staff is amazing and we'll be back.< /review>

This really is a top notch place to take your kids. The staff is just amazing, kind and really knows how to work with their little patients. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that we have to always wait. Even when I'm early and my daughters appointment is at a specific time, we rarely get into see the dentist/hygienist less than 30 minutes past our appointment time. But other than that? I love this place, enough that I'm willing to put up with the wait!</Review>

<Rate>2<//Rate><Text>I’ve been coming here for years and have never had a problem until most recently. Per the office manager the wait time most recently increased due to the volume of smaller children being seen. (6 months - toddlers) which are more difficult to attend to. Well my visit lasted two hours. All though the staff is always great with all the kids this wait time is unacceptable! They need to either get more clinical staff or spread out the time on appts to allow more time for these younger patients. Figure something out. When I was there I can literally see the chaos in the nurse and front staff of the overload of patients. I also saw the front staff regrouping as they loss patient charts. It was all bad. Anyways beware they say they warn all patients that wait time has increased. But I never got a call or warning!< /Text>< Pictures>

Taken the 3 kids there and they have done a good job so far. Everyone has been friendly. The 3 times I have been there, I have been in and out quickly (including the appointment for fillings) without being rushed. They appear  to have a good workflow and scheduling. The dentist was kind and explained things well.
I will continue taking the kids to this dentist.< /Review>

< Review>
Doctors are so good with the kids but the front desk and administrative side of this place is awful... the used phone calls, emails, and texts to confirm but apparently (I confirmed via email for both of my kids) and for my oldest they and my cel phone as primary which got confirmed, and for my youngest they had my husband as primary and he never answers his cellphone and they didn’t confirm my youngest appointment, they have two numbers in file how come they didn’t call the other or leave a message??
Ohh and to my surprise guess what... even tho we had only “confirmed” one appointment... they didn’t have the right doctor at the time ( I have hmo, shame on me I guess) so... what’s the purpose of the confirmation if they didn’t have the right doctor to see my kids??!!
Honestly thinking if I’m going back to this place! Such a messy organization! But technicians are great since I didn’t get to see a dentist lol</Review>

<Review>This place is amazing! Like HONESTLY! I have taken my son who was 2yrs old at the time to another dentistry I thought they did a good job (not knowing what the hell I was putting my 2yr through) they did 8 crowns in 2 hrs! Not to mention they tied him up!!
After that my son was traumatised!
Then I found this place! Of course my son at 4yrs old hated going dentist he was horrified! I cannot blame him. So it took a lil patience the staff at  "the orange Building" is what my son calls it are just amazing! Hands down! I promise! Dr Yoon is fabulous!! nd their assistances are also friendly and fab !!
My son is now 7 and loves to go to the dentist! 😍
I RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!
YOU WILL SEE NIGHT ND DAY JUST LIKE THAT!
THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT YOU DO TO MAKE EVERY SINGLE KID IN THAT OFFICE FEEL SPECIAL! 💜

< Review>
My two boys had been going to Dental Fun Zone for years, we were always fairly satisfied with the care they received. The staff was kind, friendly and helpful and the dental assistants whom performed the cleaning were always wonderful. The dentists were, let's just say, okay. My complaint is about the orthodontist and the communication regarding my son's braces. During our initial consult with the orthodontist, he spent maybe two minutes with my son and I. His assistant spent the next 30 min. discussing cost and answering any questions I had. After the consultation I asked if we could take the estimate home to talk over with my husband. Our family had tentative plans to move out of LA, and it was explained to me by the orthodontist's assistant that my son would have to absolutely see the same orthodontist for each follow up appointment and for the braces to be removed. Since it was explained to me that my son would need them on for two years I was nervous to commit if we moved. She said the estimate was good for 30-plus days. Once we decided to go forth with Dental Fun Zone for his braces I tried weekly to get in touch with the orthodontist or his assistant, but they never returned my call! I even went into the office twice and the front desk said they would deliver the message, and still no call back. After being brushed off for so long we decided not to return to Dental Fun Zone for regular check-ups, and to take our money elsewhere for braces. Very annoyed.< /Review>

Clean, Friendly, Thorough is the words to describe this office. My son usually cries his lungs out when strangers like his doctor when they try to check his mouth. Not in this case, My son 2 years old had no issues and no tantrum. The dentist knew what to do right away, they sat us in a room, let him pick out a cool toy, they informed me to have him sit on me for the procedure and my son took well to it all! The dentist was able to check and brush his teeth with no problem, you can tell the staff loves what they do. They really did make a connection with my son. Great Office, very welcoming and inviting.< /text>

<Review>Great all around!

We were pleasantly greeted in a lovely kid friendly office! They have a mural of zoo animals painted on the wall, an aquarium, stuffed animals everywhere - definitely makes kids feel welcome coming in there!

It was my daughter's first visit to the dentist and although she was a bit anxious through the visit, they did everything to calm her down and she even got a toy to take home. The dentist was SUPER patient with her and it didn't phase him that she didn't want him to check her teeth.

Bottom line, I wholeheartedly recommend this office! I wish I could be a patient there myself!< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>This place is nice, clean, and friendly. If you dont mind waiting 45 minutes past your appointment time then your at the right place. Not only did I arrive early but the lady politely said we could not be seen early because they were on schedule. To come early and still have to wait is poor scheduling and it should not be something customers should pay for.<//Review>< pics>

This place is amazing. Staff is super friendly and helpful. They are amazing with kids in small toddlers. My 11 year old have a lot of extractions all at once. She didn't feel a thing she was very happy and there was no pain. My two-year-old has been going there since she was 6 months. She's been back three times after that and she loves her dentist.</text>

i highly recommend children’s dental funzone in eagle rock . In my experience with my daughter which she is (two years old ) its hard for a toddler to let themselves do xrays , or any teeth work , but the girls (dentist assistants) in this dentist office are VERY HELPFUL AND NICE they made her feel comfortable enough to have them do xrays and have all the work we needed to do .  From the front desk to inside the room everyone is super nice ,helpful and have alot of patience with toddlers/kids !<//text>

<review>I love Children's dental fun zone.  Especially Dr. Mo.  Both my sons feel comfortable and I love his honesty.  I have been to a previous dental group for my son and he came out traumatized and crying.  Here at Children Dental Fun Zone they have always been patient with my boys and understanding.  I have always been with my oldest through any procedure as well which is not common in some practices.  The Dental Assistants have always been very welcoming and funny.  They make my children feel at ease.  I would definitely recommend this location in Eagle Rock.  I would not take my boys anywhere else.<//review><Date>1430505963980< /Date>< Gmap_id>

Great experience! My daughter has a fracture front tooth and was terrified to go to the dentist. We came to Children's Dental FunZone by recommendation from a friend, and it was the best decision we made. The staff was incredibly friendly and wonderful with my daughter, the environment is very relaxing and even FUN!, and the dentists were great! They were very positive in their words and methods. She was totally relaxed and event went home telling her friends about how fun it was and how she didn't feel anything. This was a potentially traumatic experience for my 6 year old, and they turned it into a good memory for my little one. I would highly recommend this place to any of my friends and family!<//Review>

<Review>My 3 year old daughter had the perfect first experience at the Dental Fun Zone.  She walked in with many fears and came out with a big smile and a gift :). The dental assistant very carefully explained all the procedures in detail to my daughter in a language she could understand.  She really enjoyed her first dental experience.  I highly recommend their services.</Review><Time>1506668345495<//Time></record></dataset><record>

The staff members are kind and helpful. My daughter was having a hard time letting her self get treatment and the Dental Hygienist and her assistant were very supportive and encourage my daughter throughout the entire process and comforted her. I was thankful we were able to finish the treatment. Pleased with the service they provide and the gifts the children receive in the end for being brave is just wonderful.</text>

Dental FunZone in Eagle Rock was THE BEST dentist office my son has been to! They made him feel comfortable and answered any questions my son and I had. The patience of these professionals is amazing. We are looking forward to the next appointment. :)</review>

This place is terrible. If your appointment is at 9am you won’t see the doctor until 10:30. Sara (office lady) is so rude and never return phone calls.</Text>

I feel like I hit the lotto by coming to your Dental Group!  EVERY single person in group was pleasant, helpful, kind and just understand kids.  Thank you all for making my 6 year old feel at home, at ease, where she stayed calm entire time through major dental work such as tooth extraction, root canal and taking care of tooth abccess!  My 6 year old want to come back to office to get fun tooth cleaning and toy!  Please open up IG page for your group so moms can tag and help spread the word!</review>

My kids are patients from here since they open this location for almost 10 years the dentists as their assistants are amazing with my kids i can not complain about them, now one of my daughters needs to see the orthodontist we went to the appointment and i didn't have my ID with me they never ask me for it before, I explained the receptionist  i lost it, when she opened the file I saw my husband ID in my daughter's file, but the receptionist told me sorry if your husband is not here we can not see your daughter and you need to reschedule, why they didn't mention that when i did the appointment, i asked to talk to the manager but she didn't called him/her she got up and went to the back office came back and told me ok we are goign to see her just gor today and if you want to star the braces we are not going to do it today, sorry but this ladies needs a little more of customer services knowledge, when they just opened was a lady in reception wow!!! She was amazing, polite and always looking the way to help, like i said dentists and assistants are amazing but receptionist needs to improve<//Review>

It’s an assembly line. The doctor you make an appointment with us never the one to see your child. Always a ridiculous wait, even if you have the first appointment. They take Xrays when completely unnecessary. Very disappointing.<//text>

Courtesy reminder when the phone call(s) are made to the client(s) would have been nice, Instead of finding out at the time of discharged.

<Text>My 3-year old came here on referral, and the dentist diagnosed enamel hyperplasia, and we had to get several crowns and baby root canals for her. The office was great in coordinating the details of insurance, anesthesia, and calming my concerns for this procedure, and even coming out to keep me updated during the procedure itself. Only concern was that we had to wait nearly 1.5 hours past the scheduled time  (9:00 am) to begin, which was tough because she hadn't been allowed to eat since dinner the night before, and she was just waiting around super hungry till they were ready for us. Wish they would have told us they were running late when we first showed up, at least to set expectations.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1535151144337, 'text': 'We’d like to thank you for your review!

Children' Dental FunZone in Eagle Rock is the best!! The staff is really nice and always helpful. The dentist can be a scary place for a kid. My daughter's dentist and the nurses have really built a great repor with her, and she doesn't even get nervous when she has to get a filling. I can't say enough about this place! I wish I could get my dentistry done here as an adult!<//review>

< review>
We chose this dentist based on reviews and what a mistake.  If you are a PPO patient, perhaps this is the place of childhood dental dreams the reviews purport, but as a DMO patient we were herded in on the ONE day a week that CERTAIN doctors see DMO patients.  My 12 yr old, who has been seeing a dentist and having dental work (cleanings, fillings and extractions) since he was 9 months old with NO ISSUES, never so much as a complaint that he didn't want to return to the dentist or that something hurt or was scary, came out of this exam room in tears.  He was in agony after a CLEANING, a boy who does not cry was sobbing in pain from a CLEANING.  They proceeded to tell us he had 2 cavities that needed filling and recommended Nitrous because was very apprehensive during his cleaning.  It took them 3 months to get back to us to let us know that the DMO denied coverages for the fillings and "oh by the way" it's actually 3 fillings and he also needs sealants.  The required work kept increasing with the price tag.  I was clearly NOT returning to this office and sought a second opinion.  A second opinion that I paid cash for, after reviewing the X-rays and a full exam they determined he had no cavities, but some pitting in previous sealants.  10 minutes, no novocaine or nitrous and she fixed the sealants.

We were DMO patients only due to an error in paperwork when my husband started a new job and are fortunate to have the means to seek a second opinion and the wherewithal to ask questions and push for answers because the billing and treatment practices at Children's Dental FunZone are suspect at best.<//review>

My kids have come here for years. Every time we have come no mater the dentist I am always pleased with the caring happy doctors and assistants. The whole atmosphere caters to kids. They have toys, tv's and even a huge salt water tank with many fish. The staff know just how to ease kids fears of coming to the dentist. As a courtesy they provide a toy each time you are done with your apointment.<//text>

Our daughter had a lot of proceedures that needed to be done. She was very nervous them. The staff at Children's Dental Fun Zone did everything to make her comfortable. They performed the proceedures quickly and professionally. Instead of being afraid anymore, my daughter asked when she could come again. We have been to many different dentists in the past year due to insurance cutting many from our choices. This was by far the best.< /text>

<text>My son Jacob was very nervous about visiting the dentist. However, when we came to children's dental fanzone in eagle rock; not only was the front counter staff amazing the assitance and doctors were so friendly and show so much passion for what they do. Thank you so much for comforting my son and helping him go through the process of two teeth extractions. He really liked how Juan Carlos showed and explain everything he was going to do during his teeth cleaning. Again keep doing an amazing job!! Thanks you for your services.</text>< gmapID>

Calling in and making appointments is hard, no one answers the phones or returns voicemails. You can not do online appointments and there is no one returning online emails for questions or appointment requests to reschedule, including corporate...smh..Besides that, the environment is great for children.</Text>

Sorry.  I really can't give it more than one star.

My son's medical insurance directed me to the Children's Dental Funzone.  The office is clean.  Appointments are usually 30-45 minutes late but usually not more than 1 hour.  Dentists seem professional and good with children.

So why only 1 star?

I really want to like this place but I can't.  Front desk staff are SO frustrating to deal with.  Junior staff are condescending and passive aggressive.  Office manager (Anna) is friendly but talking to her is like going around in circles.

They wanted approx $3,000 for a course of treatment with my child.  When I asked for details I was told that he would need to come in every 6-8 weeks.  I asked if we could book those appointments in advance.  They said no, but rather than give a straight answer, I got 5000 different (contradictory) reasons why this would be bad for me to do and result in worse care for my son.  (See end of this message for examples)

The staff person even tried to tell me that the clinic had never (!) had a case where someone was trying to make an appointment within the stated time from by couldn't.  This was pretty shocking because it has happened to me a few times already -- virtually every!  I had to wait 4 months once for the next check up time for my son (in addition to the standard 6 months in between checkups).

I asked what happens in a scenario where I pay all this money, the clinic takes my money, the clinic puts all of this equipment in my little boy's mouth that needs to be maintained and serviced on a regular basis (6-8 weeks) but their next available appointment is in their usual 4-5 months.  She didn't have any answer for that.

I really don't think a clinic should be marketing medical services for children if they can't be sure that they will be able to perform those services according to their own safety guidelines.  I am really bothered by the fact that this doesn't seem to bother anyone at Children's Dental Funzone and that, after having laid this out, they were still trying to market these $ervices to my family.

----

EXAMPLES OF THE DIFFERENT BS REASONS WHY THEY WON'T MAKE APPOINTMENTS IN ADVANCE

CDFZ Staff: "We don't make appointments in advance because even though almost all of them are scheduled for the same length of time every once in a while like if your son breaks the equipment, we'd need to schedule a longer appointment and then your son would fall behind?"

Me: "Why would he fall behind?  In the remote possibility that he breaks the equipment, I would have to call on that day and make a longer appointment anyway and be at the mercy of whatever is available.  That's no different than if I didn't have any appointments set up.  So in the extreme case, I'm no worse than when we started but in 99% of situations we'd be ahead"

CDFZ Staff: "Ummmm....  well we don't like to do that because it makes scheduling complicated"

Me:  "What is complicated about booking in advance?  If he needs 4 sessions every 6-8 weeks why not book them now?  What is complicated about that?"

CDFZ Staff: "It's because of patient care"

Me:  "What is better about patient care if you put a ton of medical equipment in my son's mouth, cash my check, and then are too busy to see him again?"

CDFZ Staff: "But if you son breaks the equipment then he would need a longer appointment"

Me: "Yes, we just covered that at the beginning of this conversation..." [and we cycle through various 'reasons' again]</Review>

Was so happy with how my son was treated during his check-up, it was his first time and even though he fussed the assistant and dentist both talked to him the entire time to help calm him down. Nothing was forced on us, they were gentle, fast and very friendly.< /text>

The fact when both of my kids 5 and 7 year old keep asking to visit Dr Shake Garibian is better than review. So clean, so friendly and professional. Just do not be late because they are so busy.
We had horrible experience with Kids Dental Place in Eagle Rock plaza which makes the difference even more obvious.
Thank you Children's Dental FunZone, Tserunian family.< /Review>

<review>Dr. Mo and his Assistant Scotty were incredible in the handling of my 5 year old daughters dental care. She never had any work done prior to this so I was very anxious at the onset. She got a molar pulled, a filling and two crowns. We got it done in two visits and we were able to complete all the work with great results. Dr. Mo and Scotty treated her as if she was their own child. They were very in tune and communicative with myself and my daughter about her needs and wants and this made it so much more comfortable. They allowed my two year old son to snack and roam while the work was getting done, so that I could sit with my daughter and hold her hands. The TV set up is great for when the operation is in progress and the toy rooms were also very helpful so no one got bored. My daughter cried during the novicane shots and at the start of the operation because she didn't want to wear the cup on her nose (which gives her the laughing gas) but the moment they started she calmed down and was very cooperative and watched the movie that was on. Dr. Mo moved really quickly and showed me everything he was doing as he went along. I feel my daughters dental health is in very good hands and I am thankful I came to Kids Fun Zone initially for a second opinion. Ps: Shout out to Ada at the front desk, who just had her third child and was so sweet and helpful through the whole process. I didn't get the names of the others who did the digital x-rays, but they were also really great. Overall, a great experience, despite how traumatic dental work can be for the little ones.< /review>< userid>

Funzone Dental has earned a patient for life!  My three year old Daughter went in to have her badly decayed, two front teeth removed.  Our dentist was Doctor Shakeh, who was just super!  Dr. Shakeh was very knowledgable, patient, kind, and gental. Her assistant, Jenny, and the hygenist, Stacy, were also just amazing with kids, super patient and gental, taking their time to explain what was happening, and making the whole experience fantastic... Yes, fatastic!  The office is crowded, but now I understand why.  Your kids will WANT to go to the dentist!  Thank you Dr. Shakeh, Asststant Jenny, & hygenist Stacy, you are the BEST!<//review>
