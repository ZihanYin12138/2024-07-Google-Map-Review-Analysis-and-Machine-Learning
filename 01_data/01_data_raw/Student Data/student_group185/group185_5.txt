<review>I am feeling like finding another tax person. I am 10 years strong with H&R and its been lackluster the 2019 and 2020 tax years. I do everything my tax person tells me yet I keep owing. When I asked why 2019 I owed $87 federal and $900+  state, she couldn't tell me why. She was more baffled by that than me. As a master tax preparer she should have known. I believe in loyalty but my goodness. I don't know what else to do. I am tired of them taking my money esp when I pay taxes and follow the instructions of a tax professional.< /review>< Pictures>

Too expensive and seems to get more expensive each year. It's motivated me to learn how to do my own taxes, so that's cool.  I can't in good conscience recommend them based on price.  They are friendly and as far as I know are doing their best.  I can't afford a Tesla ship I drive a Ford....it is what it is.< /text>

< review>
I recently had a number of questions about 2020 tax planning and retirement planning.  I have an exceptionally knowledgeable tax expert at this H&R office, but she is on sabbatical doing continuing education and preparing for the 2020 tax season. Another experienced tax expert at this office, Sam, stepped up and offered to help me.  I was very pleased with his advise, and he educated me on a couple of important tax issues that I was not aware of.  I was much better able to lay out a good tax forecast for 2020 and apply the advise Sam gave me to regarding 401K withdrawal planning.  If you have tax planning issues, or are just looking for support with your tax filing, this office has genuine experts who have long-term experience and current tax law knowledge to help you.</review>

If you work for the State or Federal and you want not just someone knowledgeable, but trustworthy and professional, you must go see Linda Minard, EA and tell her Maribel Landeros referred you. Her 28yrs of experience really shows. ..from one State employee to another, she's not about cheating or hiding info, and answers EVERY question you have with solid IRS knowledge. She's been my to go to person since 2010 and I wouldn't go to ANYONE else.< /Review>

Folks, listen to me and do yourselves a big favor and avoid this office at all cost. DO NOT LET THIS OFFICE DO YOUR TAXES FOR YOU. I wanted to have my corporate tax return at this office and Pamela Seifen was the person who handles corporate tax returns. After I was told by her that I needed to wait for 8 to 12 weeks for my refund and I never received it I tried calling her which she ignored and my emails which she ignored as well. After calling HR Block main office she called me back to let me know she will follow up within couple days which she never did. After about a week trying to call her back she answered in a very rude way and said she cannot help me and I have to call the IRS myself. Really Pamela???!!! After spending about $1500 each year at your office for two consecutive years, this is how you treat loyal customer. I will never go back to her office and I advise all you guys out there not to either. Save yourself money and time by going somewhere how customers should be treated.</Text>< response>

Worst tax office in the world. After being screwed by the first tax preparer on two separate year's returns and owing the gov't thousands due to his mistakes (he was fired because of this), we were assisted by another "senior" professional Pam Seifen who has consistently made mistakes of her own and doesn't follow up ever. I have  spent literally dozens of hours on the phone and emailing just to get our claims resolved so we can move on but after almost a year still don't have resolution. The district manager has had to get involved but we still aren't where we need to be. Do NOT EVER go here.<//Text>

I celebrated my PhD last night in this great place. happy to tell that we enjoyed a superb evening and the place was indeed one of the reasons for this happy gathering. The waiters  contributed in a splendid style, the cooking was appetizing and my friends were very  glad. We shall surely visit again for more joyful events. thanks very much.<//text>

<text>Excellent little place in Chinatown. The Hunan smoked pork was out of this world.  We also had the Hunan Chicken which was also great.  Both had a very nice heat that would sneak up on you.  Lots of food for very reasonable prices.  We picked a winner with this place.</text>< pictures>

It's the service you expect from any sort of Panda Express and has the same taste as all of them. The food is average (obviously since it's fast food). The speed of the restaurant is quick and the food is hot since they serve so many people.< /review>

Compared to other Pandas, the food is about the same in quality - however, due to the HUGE number of students they serve, the food is always fresh and hot during the quarter. The line moves fast and the prices are average. It's a good eating option on campus<//review>

Two stars for being edible. Their Kung Pao Cucumber is pretty good, plenty of cucumber, chill pepper, and peanuts, with some finishing touches of chicken pieces. Other food are mostly edible matter.<//review>

On top of that, they were speaking Spanish the entire time making it feel like they were talking smack about us behind the counter. The food was not good either since the chow mein and rice was dry and on top of that I got more oil and mushrooms than steak for the Shanghai Angus Steak, also being charged $1.25 more.

Served very small  portions and when I asked for more because the amount claimed to have 41 grams of protein I was told that's the amount when it was half as much as I got at every other Panda Express I had ever been too</text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I love the orange chicken here! The rice is a little dry compared to the Japanese one, but you can eat it. You may not need a fortune cookie that you give me every time ... Your mouth will be moisturized.

This place is by far the best place that I've gone to in the SF area. I'm purely talking about the customer service. I know to some people customer service doesn't really matter but to those that do, they treat you really nicely. Their eighths of flower are closer to 4.0 than 3.5 and reasonably priced. They also him it up for first time customers. I love it here!</Text>

I'm a professional woman and mother in my 40's. I tried marijuana in college. Twice. Recreational marijuana is not my thing, and I'm not that kind of woman. But I was desperate for treatment for a hard-to-treat medical condition that threatened to impact my career, my family, and everything I had worked so hard to build in my life. I received caring and thoughtful advice. The staff took a lot of time to thoroughly explain my options and I was able to make an informed choice that really helped me. I'm feeling much better now and I'm really grateful for their help.<//Review><date>1501354012012< /date>< user_name>

This place is seriously unprofessional.  I got violently ill from one of their products (so did my partner.)

When I told them, the owner (female) just denied everything.  Said it must have been me, I must have consumed too much, etc.  Completely untrue.

All I can say is, I hope this doesn’t happen to anyone else.  Now I have been banned from their store.    Seriously???? What are you hiding???!!!<//text>

I checked out both the dispensaries that were practically on the same block and decided to go with the Wellness Center vs. SureFyre Collective based on the fact that Wellness Center's prices were much more reasonable. I wasn't too impressed with SureFyre's smaller collection of flower choices (they have quite a few options with edibles/vapes/etc, but not much flower) and was pleasantly surprised to find out that the Wellness Center had much more flower options for different budgets. Matt helped me out and totally hooked it up- he was incredibly patient and helpful in his suggestions and worked within my budget and needs. He took the time to explain and suggest and his suggestions were right on. I walked out the door and when I looked in my bag found he had totally hooked it up and thrown in some goodies I wasn't expecting. If you're looking for good quality flower and Matt is around, he's your man. I am not into the hype of marijuana, so if you want down to earth people and reasonable prices, check out the Wellness Center. I ended up trying the Ingrid Indica and its one of the best buds I've ever had! Thanks again, Matt!<//Text>

<Text>employees acted as though they were selling something illegal, as in a speakeasy during prohibition.
wouldn't let me see what they sell until after they collected all my info, so i left.

places like this will disappear if cannabis is legalized and customers have enough choices to avoid the places with abrupt staff and that hide product behind curtains.< /Text>< time>

Good stuff.. Inventive tacos. The chef and front guys were great. Everyone is quick to take your money. These guys made me feel like I didn't have to pay if I didnt like them.. With confidence to their creations.< /review>

Small shop, with big flavor.
They've brought the place up a notch now that a new taco shop is set to open on the corner, replacing the Fosters Freeze (or whatever it was)  new paint, new TV, new tables and chairs, new refrigerator, new condiment bar. A whole lot cleaner now, too, which gets them another star, in my book.
Get the Tacos Fundidos, al pastor, "con todo". Thank me later.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Terrible service and food is not what they show in the photos, for example the bread is not fresh three times buy cemitas and three times masudo, the meat burned, three slices of avocado, a piece of onion, no salt, no oil and no Papalo, the Arab tacos if you can call them that way with almost no meat and the little meat that has a very bad and rancid taste, and so I can keep mentioning more food etc, etc, etc, the place is very dirty, I really don't recommend eating there .

Pésimo servicio y la comida no es lo que enseñan en las fotos, ejemplo el pan no es fresco tres veces compre cemitas y las tres veces masudo, la carne quemada, tres rebanadas de aguacate, un pedacito de cebolla, sin sal no aceite y no papalo, los tacos árabes si se les puede llamar así casi sin carne y la poca carne que tiene con muy mal sabor y rancia, y así puedo seguir mencionando más comida etc, etc, etc, el lugar muy sucio la verdad no recomiendo comer ahí.<//review>

<review>My first bike tour, and hopefully not my last! Harris was an exceptional guide, offered lots of interesting tales about LA history, and very adept at navigating through different neighborhoods and throughways. Definitely recommend for seeing a wide swath of the city while enjoying the beautiful weather!< /review>< Resp>

The tour itself is very interesting with lots of fun facts about West Hollywood and Beverly Hills.  Part of the tour is a walking tour of Greystone Mansion which has quite a story in itself.

This bike tour was the highlight of my visit to the Hollywood area since I didn't really like the Walk of Fame and other tourist traps.<//review>< userid>

Highlight of my SoCal trip. This LA in a day tour was amazing. I used to think LA was just a big bowl of yucky smog. But Erik, the guide, had such a passion for LA, and shared so many details about its history, present happenings, and future possibilities, that it truly made me appreciate the city in a new way. I can't say enough about how good this tour was. And the electric bikes were awesome. We covered 30+ miles. I never thought of LA as a bike-friendly city...but it actually is, if you know where to go. Thank you!!!!< /review>

The Beverly Hills bike tour, hiking Griffith Observatory, and last year I did LA in a day. They are awesome. All the tour guides are friendly, knowledgeable, and funny. Even with Covid-19 I was able to do LA in a day, and see a lot. The tour guides Kris and Eric are amazing. I recommend this place to everyone who visits LA, and you won't regret it.< /text>< username>

<Text>It's not everyday that I actively decide to hike 5.5 miles on an incline as intense as the Hollywood Hills in Griffith Park, but I am so happy that I took part in the sunset hike with Bikes and Hikes LA! What a stunning way to explore Griffith Park and see the beautiful city of LA in ways I couldn't possibly have imagined. Our guide, Elizabeth, was incredible! Absolutely elevated the whole experience with her amazing energy and never-ending knowledge of the surrounding areas. As well as an over abundance of quirky/fun stories throughout the entire hike. As beat as I was by the end of the hike, I wish it could have lasted longer because I'm sure Elizabeth had many more stories to tell - would have loved to find out all about the many locations 500 Days of Summer was shot at (her specialty). Overall, such a great experience and friendly/supportive staff. Look forward to returning to LA and trying the bike tour!
Also! Don't be afraid to go alone! There were quite a few single hikers who very quickly made friends with other hikers in our group and not to mention, Elizabeth was very kind to help everyone get that perfect shot for the Gram.</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOG3Y6SELjRsig-Hzb-Q4nHMDq5_Kd5xNy_a30t=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPN7kDT1_fnnD9FpIvsjJpPmnWfOu-KMh0zrqsT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

Awesome tour! I've been on some in the past and this one was really engaging, very comfortable. Bus had open windows, but was covered and clean with great seats.The host, Roshan, did a great job of engaging the entire group and keeping energy up. There was also a very loud, obnoxious group on board (literally yelling over him at each other, get it together ladies) and he was able to make sure that they didn't dominate the tour without yelling over them.< /Text>

Decided to fly here for my bday weekend after other plans got derailed, and I’ve never been hiking so I figured why not go big. My hotel was in Santa Monica and I took an Uber to the site(it was worth it).  I was here for 4 days and did a lot of things and this was definitely the highlight  of my trip. Harris our tour guide was perfect( I was expecting a robot lol), he’s really knowledgeable and laid back. Our group meshed well but Harris really broke the ice, a very fun group. If you want to do this hike on your own to ahead, but i will definitely come back and do it with them. Thank you guys so much for a great birthday weekend!</text>

If you want to be awesome and bike all over CA -this is the place to come to! Rob was awesome-super friendly and helpful. I did the bike tour in '07 but this time my best friend put me in charge of leading. We reserved our bikes online which offers you a discount. Rob gave us our bikes, their policies,  and a map to follow. He showed us the ferry schedule as well.</review>

Awesome people. Awesome recommendation and prices are lower than the other bike tour places. Not to mention they have plenty of other gears to rent as well. Hikes, camping, snow gear, bikes, etc. Would def recommend.</text>

<Text>This review is specifically for the bike rentals available. When looking for a bike rental in San Francisco for the oh-so-touristy ride across the Golden Gate Bridge, this should be your go-to place. For only $15 (not including the 10% discount for Yelpers,) I was able to rent a spiffy 7-speed that was in great condition and pick up a little granola bar all in one fell swoop.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1600672566856, 'text': "Hi Michael, while we're glad you had a nice time, we believe you have us confused with another company.

So much fun!!! I have done a number of bike tours in various cities around the world and this was the most entertaining! The guides were fantastic. Chatty, engaging, friendly! What more could you ask??

The tour itself was awesome, we saw so much of LA and learnt so much random trivia along the way.

There are definitely some hills (Beverly Hills isn't just a pretty name!) and you cover a lot of ground so be prepared for a sore butt if you are like me and don't ride in your day to day life. So worth it though!

The team provide water and snacks and lunch was available for purchase at Venice Beach. Perhaps most importantly, an ice cold beer was also provided back at the depot at the end of the tour.

What more can I say? Do this tour!! You wont regret it!</review>

Worst experience ever as a company, extremely rude.
After reading reviews from multiple websites, I decided to rent a bike from this location. Apparently this guys don't check their bike before renting and I got a defective bike. As you can see from the elevation map I was riding downhill and didn't realize it it is defective until I tried to go uphill. When I realized it and called them and after second try they were able to fix the bike and I came back and asked for a refund. Until this time everything was going as business as usual, then rental employee called his boss to explain the situation. Unfortunately, owner don't realize that he is in service industry and started yelling at me over the phone. I calmly explained my situation and showed all the photos and videos that I took to his employee. They denied any wrongdoing even though I had all the proof.
Attached photos are proof to show the elevation map and time/milage.
Instead of apologizing they continue lying.<//text>

<Resp>{'time': 1572910263195, 'text': "We’d like to provide some context for this unusual poor review. Gary rented an electric bike from us and unfortunately experienced an issue with a safety setting erroneously activating. This throttled his top speed at 10 miles per hour instead of 20 mph.  Before Gary left the shop we instructed him to called us for help should he need it, and he did.   Within two minutes of him calling, we told him how to deactivate the safety and Gary’s bike was fixed and he was on his way. Gary enjoyed our bike for 7 hours and pedaled over 40 miles.\n\nUpon return and to our surprise, he requested a full refund because of this two-minute inconvenience. We decided not to issue a refund, as we were able to fix his bike over the phone within minutes. We offered Gary a cold beer for the inconvenience at which point he threatened to write this review and dispute the charge and see that he kept his word.

All these years,  I never knew there was a trail that takes you from the legion of honor all the way to the Sutro Bath. We meant to go see the labyrinth but made a wrong turn at the junction and ended up at the Sutro Bath but turned out great. It's like you are walking in the rainforest or jungles. It's so green  , misty and foggy . So beautiful.<//text>

<resp>{'time': 1582767965148, 'text': 'First, this interaction did not happen at Bikes and Hikes LA, it was at a neighboring bike shop which is a completely separate business. But with that said, for anyone reading this, please understand the following: they are a small business. As a way of giving back to the community, they spent $500 to install a free street pump with tools to help assist folks like Mohamed put air in their tires. They are not required to provide a free pump to anyone that wants it; they did it because they wanted to help people that needed air or needed to do a quick adjustment to their bike. But we can’t have nice things: people kept stealing their tools and breaking their pump, so after replacing the pump four times and replacing the tools five times, they could not afford to do so anymore and had to have it removed.\n\nThey then decided that they would still provide bikers with a free SELF-USE pump inside their shop if they stopped in and asked us... but if they needed the bike shop to assist in any way, they would have to charge them for labor because that’s how they are able to stay in business.\n\nMohammed came in today and asked to use their SELF-USE pump, and they gladly let him use it, for free. Mohammed did not know how to use a pump (as evidenced by his admission in this review that he’s needed to ask for help filling his tires in the past), so instead of adding air to his tire, HE LET THE AIR OUT and then accused the shop of letting him use faulty equipment and demanded that they fill his tires with air. They told him that the equipment was not faulty and that if he wanted them to stop what they were doing to fill his tires with air it would cost $5 (this is posted in their window and on their counter, by the way). He agreed to pay the $5 and they filled his tires with air using the very same pump he insisted was broken, and off he went. One hour later he posted this review which, at its core, is complaining that a business didn’t provide him with free labor (think about how absurd that sounds when you say it out loud).\n\nBecause of Mohamed, our friends next door will no longer offer a free pump to anyone and will charge $5 for a professional to add air to your tires.\n\nYou can all thank Mohamed!'}</resp><Text>Went in like usual to use the bike pump which was removed outside. Asked if there was a pump I could use inside to pump my bike, after having trouble pumping air into my bike. I asked if there was another pump or if I could get assistance. Was then told I would be charged $5 to get assistance. After my bike tired was completely flat due to pump. (I’ve been assisted the last two times I went in without anyone ever saying that there is a fee to get assistance.)</Text><user_id>113222634918520894345<//user_id>< rating>

<review>This was my first trip to the States and therefore the first time in LA. I only had 3 days passing through, so immediately booked a guided bike tour around the city, thinking this would be the best way to avoid traffic, see all the sights and get a little exercise done!

I was certainly not disappointed! Despite an unusual downpour, our guide, Erik, kept our small group of three in high spirits with stories from his youth growing up in the area and explaining about the awesome mix of cultures in the city. His breadth and depth of knowledge on all things LA-related is astounding! From pointing out little-known architectural gems to knowing the history of ownership of particular houses and estates, going all the way back to the previous century, there was no question he couldn't answer. By the time we were at the coast in the afternoon, it was sunny and warming up, leading to a great cruise along the coast and back to West Hollywood just as the sun was setting.

If you have a day, are in reasonable shape and want a unique way to experience around 30 miles of the city, this is definitely something you should try! I'll be back in LA in a few months' time and I've already promised the crew at Bikes and Hikes LA that I'll be back to experience this epic tour again - hopefully with a little less rain!</review>< Pics>

A man was following me down the sidewalk and I stepped into this establishment to seek refuge. I informed the woman at the front that I was being followed and moments later the man came in. She alerted her male coworker who told me I could step into their back room instead of remaining in their store front. He confronted the man forced him to leave. They gave me a water while I waiting for my Lyft to arrive. Greatly appreciated how they handled the situation and made my safety a priority in that moment.</text>

Kris was a great guide with lots of knowledge, great story about the munchkin actors from Wizard of Oz and their behavior at the hotel they were set up in during the filming. Lots of sites and change in landscape throughout the day. Absolutely recommend upgrading to an ebike and bringing sunscreen.  Highlight of the weekend.

<rating>5<//rating><text>Very pleasant and informative bike tour. Highly recommended!
Bikes and Hikes gave excellent support and knowledge for the "The ultimate Los Angeles bike tour". They provided a personal attetion together with high-quality brand new bikes.
I have not been on a bike in several years and this was a great way to get myself back into biking with a fun group and a personal follow-up.
I had a great time from start to finish. Our tour guide, Dan and his trainee David were always right there close to help. They really paid attention to details and went out of their way to make the tour as pleasant as possible for all of us.
It was an incredible opportunity for exercise and education. Dan is very friendly and knowledgeable of the city and its history.  In every step of the tour, he suprised us with different stories. It was very entertaining and exciting.

This tour was a superb exploration of the city and a memorable experience. I would highly recommend it to anyone!
The personal attention and entertainment provided by the group leaders takes their tours to the next level. Thank you Dan and David for a wonderful day. I would go back in a minute to another tour with Bikes and Hikes!<//text>< Pictures>

Alina was our guild and she was brilliant, she was friendly, personable and she had stories and information about the every area of LA.  She also looked after everyone and when some people in the group fell behind she went to help and even helped carry one baby for a section of the hike to give the mother a break.  The hike itself was very well paced, some lovely photo spots, not too challenging but enough that you know your doing a hike!  All in all thank you Alina! Would definitely recommend.< /review>< user_name>

This hike was the highlight of my trip to LA. George really looked after the group, was so knowledgeable and friendly and gave us so much history, I didn't expect to come away learning so many new facts. Thanks George! I highly recommend the hike, I will be back next time.< /Review>

06/23/19 We went on the LA in a day tour and it was excellent. We covered so many areas in just one day. It was amazing how many places we can say we have been and seen after this tour. Our tour guide, George was terrific! He shared a lot of information about the area. Our epic adventure was especially challenging and George took care of everything. I would highly recommend any of their tours. This was a very physically challenging ride. The first few hours are hilly. It is also over 30 miles. My first tip would be unless you cycle 20+ miles 3X per week, upgrade to an E-bike. They are very easy to use and well worth the extra fee. This way you have the option of having assistance with the hills if needed. Also, consider what terrain you are accustomed to; we came from Florida where it is relatively flat, so this was especially difficult. Another tip, if you leave your purse or bag behind, make sure you take your sun screen out first. This was our favorite outing during our L.A. visit.  If you don't have this much time.  Consider one of their shorter tours.<//review>

<review>I dead the Hollywood sign hike on Saturday December 7th. What a fabulous way to get fabulous photos of the Hollywood sign and to get great views of Hollywood and the rest of LA. The hike is easy going; anybody can enjoy it. There were 10 other people on the tour with me, all with very different fitness levels, and it was very clear that everyone enjoyed it thoroughly. Our guide Kate was amazing. She did a perfect job of pacing the hike so that everybody got the most out of it. And she was so knowledgable about Hollywood, LA and Griffith Park, as well as hugely entertaining. You have to do this tour!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><user>104740652244186457218< /user><Name>Claire JL< /Name>< Response>

We had a great hike with Kate. Our family of 5 was on LA for the first time and we enjoyed the guided hike because we got some good stories and history of the area and the Hollywood hills. Kate was very energetic and did a good job of keeping the hike moving, but taking adequate breaks. I had the youngest people in the group, with 10,12, and 17 year olds, so I wasn't sure if the hike was going to be too much for my youngest. We hike at home, but don't have white the same incline. The very beginning of the hike is uphill and I was hearing some groans from my youngest, but after the first stop or two, he was fully engaged and loving it. I'd recommend it for all ages.<//text>

From hilltop Beverly Hills mansions to white sand beaches and everything in between, this tour literally has it all!
As a resident of Los Angeles, I was worried I wouldn’t see or do anything new, however, I was pleasantly surprised by the knowledge of our tour guide, George. The best tour I’ve ever had. He kept it fun and exciting.
This bike tour is a must for anyone visiting (or living) in LA.< /review>

One of the best things to do ever!!!  Eric is an excellent guide. On a gorgeous Saturday in May 2019 we biked in a big loop from Hollywood thru multiple points of interest including Beverly Hills to Santa Monica, Venice Beach, Marina Del Rey and back.  So fun!</Text>

<rate>5</rate><text>I did an incredible day-long Los Angeles bike tour with them last year and loved it so much that I convinced my company to use Bikes and Hikes to provide activities for the different teams that were coming to LA for a big corporate event. Some did a hike in the Hollywood Hills to see the Hollywood Sign, some did a bike tour in Santa Monica and Venice Beach, and every single person had a fantastic time! They were able to accommodate every single request we threw at them, and their staff was phenomenal.< /text></record>

<Text>My co-workers and I all agree Bikes and Hikes has the best outdoor activities in LA - we had a choice of all sorts of team building tours including sand castle building, whale watching and yoga in the park! Our whole group went on the foodie bike tour - what a blast! Great staff, awesome adventure and the bikes were fun and felt safe! Highly recommended!<//Text>< pictures>

< Review>
The bike i rented was in very good condition.
The support was not good. They don't provide a spare tube, you have to buy it, they don't provide backpack, you have to pay extra, they don't help you to adjust the saddle... I rented the bike for 24h, for 1 more hour, they wanted to pay extra for 24h.
Generally, unfriendly and not helpful.

This statement is 100% true, is written in order other customers to be aware of what to expect< /Review>

My fiancé and I wanted to discover Hollywood without the traffic and hassle of finding a parking spot. Booking with this company was extremely easy. Upon arrival we were greeted at the door by two friendly men who had us sign waivers. They then directed us to the back where we got our gear. They also provide water!!! Once we got outside our tour guide Andrew, got us fitted on our bikes. He was extremely friendly and very talkative. The tour was very fun. Andrew told a lot of fun facts along the way. We stopped and took a few pictures and were given time to look around a few places. This tour was amazing. I would highly recommend Andrew as a tour guide!!<//Text>

We had a great time on our Hollywood bike tour.  We had a group of seven people that ranged in age from 4 years old to 63 years old, and everyone loved it.  Our young daughters had a blast, and we never felt unsafe with them on the road.  One daughter rode a tag-a-long, and the other rode in a trailer. Danny was a funny, informed tour guide.  We will be bringing more of our guests here when they come to visit us.</review>

Our family had a beautiful ride through Santa Monica and Venice with Bikes and Hikes. The tour guide, Alex, was well prepared and knowledgeable, the bikes were in excellent condition, and the locale was fascinating. We were also pleased with our guide’s recommendations on things to do and places to eat nearby after the tour finished.< /Review>

<Text>Wow what a ride! I would recommend bike shorts on the tour as the seats are not cushioned.  This is definitely the best way to see a lot of the city.  Also this is not a novice ride the hills took out a few in our group.  Being an experienced rider is a plus.  Staff was great and very well versed in the city.  Our group was Chase and Lindsay.</Text>< username>

This was a great way to spend our first day in LA seeing the sites! Our guide, Danny, was fantastic, full of facts and he really engaged with our 2 boys (10&7).  A comfortable pace riding and Danny made you feel confident driving with the traffic on the roads. I would highly recommend this for value, fun and experience.<//Review>

These guys were great,  3 of them took us on the tour with the lead being his 1st time. The guides were great. I ended up being 15 minutes late & the shuttled me to a point to meet up with the group. Water,  well timed breaks for the buttocks & lunch made the 6+ hour trip a blast. Would definitely do again.</text>

The employees were knowledgeable and helpful. Good pick ups for bikers- tire lubbers or whatever they're called to remove tires from wheels. Tri Flo lube, and some nice all purpose bike tools.< /review>

I was on the Sunset hike of Bikes and Hikes in Griffith Park. I had an absolute blast, our tour guide Kayla knew so much about the park itself, the city of Los Angeles, and she had a enthusiastic way of telling her stories that made it entertaining and easy to follow her. The hike itself is moderate, the first part is the "hardest", where we had to ascend about 400ft. It was well worth the view though. Fantastic outlooks over Los Angeles county and if you're lucky with the weather and it's not too hazy you get a nice view of the Hollywood sign. The tour was rounded off with visiting the Griffith observatory, where Kayla had a lot of interesting stories to tell again and we got to touch an age-old meteor piece. I definitely recommend taking a hike with Bikes and Hikes!</Text>

Went on a bike tour this morning and it was a totally awesome experience. I've lived in L.A. for 25 years, and I felt like I was seeing the city for the first time, with fresh eyes: I saw all these cool, tucked-away neighborhoods and scenic views I'd never even been aware of. And it was a good workout. I highly recommend Bikes & Hikes!< /Text>

<text>The 6 hour/32 miles bike tour was an awesome way to see so many sights in LA. Our guide Harris was very personable and informative.

<Name>Tara Ryan</Name><Text>I've done three tours at Bikes and Hikes LA. All three were awesome! The LA in a Day is my absolute favorite, because I got to see the whole city in just a couple of hours. I loved being outside and learning about this great city. Also the Sunset Hike I did was just voted the number one tour in Where Magazine. Bikes and Hikes LA is really proud of that and now I know why. It is an amazing hike and the view is incredible. After seeing everything up close on the LA in a Day and the Hollywood Bike Adventure, the Sunset Hike was a great way to get to see the city from above. Incredible. I would definitely recommend these tours to everyone!!!!<//Text>< GmapID>

They offer the best way you could ever experience a city like LA. Instead of sitting on a bus in traffic you pedal past all the highlights. You even go to places buses can't even access. The guide was super knowledgeable and even shared personal stories. Can only recommend!< /Text>

Great interaction in our group and just a terrific staff. Can't wait to do this again..They also had the coolest mascot..Woof woof Tucker.< /review>

Thank you Dan (DW). We had an amazing time with him. What was supposed to be a group tour turned out to be a personal tour and it was amazing. He took us to some great sites in Hollywood Hills and gave us lots of knowledge of LA. All around outstanding experience! Will definitely recommend this place and Dan to anyone.<//review>

My husband and I visited L. A for the firs time ever last week from Canada. We are both the outdoorsey adventure types! We really enjoy getting to see new places and meet new people! We did the L. A. in a day bike tour! While we were on the go for four straight days this tour was hands down the best part of our whole trip! :)

The establishment was modern, clean and organized! We were pleasantly surprised when we found out that we were the only two who have booked the tour so we had the privilege of a private tour! We were greeted by a friendly employee the moment we arrived on the site. We were able to leave a bag of valuables at the site instead of urging it around all day. We were given a quick safety review and quick introductions were made then we were on our way!

Our guide was Daniel and he was training Chase the day of our tour! Daniel was able to provide insightful anecdotes all along our excursion. He was able to answer all of our questions about the sites and sounds of L. A. He encouraed us to wonder, told us stories, peeked our curiosity, pointed out the various city boundaries and landmarks, made us laugh and best of all made us feel like we were already long time friends. Daniel not only navigated us through the busy streets but also helped us feel safe in uncharted territory.

The pace of our tour was perfect. We took several breaks for restrooms and water. We stopped and had a delicious lunch by the beach. Which was wisely pre- arranged in the morning so we didn't have to wait in any lines for our food.

We were provided with safety vests and well fitted helmets, water bottles and well maintained bicycles. We loved every minute and would recommend this tour to anyone who likes biking, exploring and hearing about the ins and outs of the area!

Thank you Bikes and Hikes for setting up this awesome Tour!<//text>

<Review>We had decided to book the Hollywood hike tour since we have never been and wanted to do the tour. We booked it a few days in advanced for the am tour since we had other plans later in the day. Since we weren't staying super close to the location we left about an hour early. On the way there(about 45 before our tour) we got an email saying they had rebooked our tour. It would have been nice if they could have given us more notice so we could have found something else to do and we were not the only people to show up. Very poor communication. Wasted a perfectly good day when we could have done another tour for the money we spend on the pass.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Time>1546404378290</Time></record></dataset><record>

Every time I am in LA I book a tour with Bikes and Hikes and everytime I am glad I did. Earlier this month we did the LA in a day bike tour again. We feel like we covered about as much as you could of LA in a day. Our guide Chase was incredibly knowledgable and answered all of our many questions. Also he makes the ride a lot of fun! From start to finish the tour was fantastic. In the beginning of the tour you have to conquer some (Beverly) hills but the guide stops enough to tell about the attractions while you can catch your breath again. As soon as you leave Beverly Hills the rest of the ride is flat and easy to do (even when you are not an experienced bike rider). Everyone should do this tour when in LA. It is the best way to see the city. It is so much better to be on a bike with that LA weather than stuck in traffic in your air conditioned car! On my tour there were even some locals, that is how interesting it is! Would highly recommend it!<//Text>

The self-guided bike tour is a must! Great eco-friendly way to experience the city with excellent audio. Especially nice if you want the independence to go and see a few things on your own.</text>

My girlfriend and I got caught in traffic so we had to catch up with the group, fortunately we found them because we can hear the tour guide Nina from the bottom of the trail given they had a 20mins head start. Goes to show how interactive and vocal and lively the staff are. And kelly the trainee was awesome as well always keeping an eye on the group making sure no one gets left behind. It was an over-all educational and relaxing hike. I would suggest and recommend this group all day.<//text>

This is probably the best way to see Los Angeles. The tour was exceptionally organised and Eric and Matthew were awesome and Eric is extremely knowledgeable. I learnt a lot about the city which I definitely wouldn't have otherwise. I would recommend this bike tour to everyone who comes to Los Angeles. You will have the best time ever.<//Review>

<review>We did the Hollywood Hills Sunset Hike and it was amazing!! Our tour guide, Else, was so knowledgeable, friendly, and accommodating. I have been on guided tours before and they are normally a walk, point, and take pictures thing but this was so much more. She knows more than what to point and show you and gives so many historical and interesting facts about everything. She also gave suggestions of other places to visit based on your interests and answered all of our weird, random, questions that sometimes had nothing to do with the tour we were on lol. I have exercise induced asthma and don't workout but I did fine on the tour so if you are worried about anything like that don't be. They are very accommodating and will let you go at a comfortable pace. I definitely recommend this to anyone visiting California.< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>I took the LA in a Day Bike Tour earlier this month and it was fantastic.  You do not need to be an experienced biker to take this tour altough you get to see a lot of the city. Our very informative guide Chase took us from West Hollywood to Beverly Hills, Brentwood, Westwood, Santa Monica and Venice.   You see parts of the city up close that you otherwise might just pass by on a bus tour or in a car. The best way to see the city!<//Text><user_id>106501797611916295225</user_id><rate>5< /rate></record>

Wonderful experience. My guide Salo was very informative. Continuation narration of history and movie locations within the park as well as information on the magnificant sights. The pace of the hike was user friendly and informative. Salo saved the best for last as he took me to attended the observatory for sunset and also took me round the important exhibits of the observatory. Brilliant excursion and well worth the price. My guide Salo for very accomodating even helping to store large back pack in his car, carrying my water bottle and also offered small snacks. In the end even offered a lift to the station.<//Text>

"Hi Mom!  I made it to the top of Hollywood!"

Yes, I sent that ridiculous text, accompanied with a goofy tourist smile and my fist pumped up in the air.  The backdrop?  A breathtaking view of the mountains, the gorgeous skyline, and the entirety of Los Angeles.

Believe it or not, I live here.  But to my delight, the Bikes and Hikes Sunset Tour reignited my love affair with with LA!  It allowed me to experience my city through a new lens - a lens that my mind (and my camera roll) will never forget.

Leading my hike was a handsome tour guide by the name of Solomon.  He had an adorable Colombian accent and a killer sense of humor.  OH!  And speaking of killers - did you know that Colonel Griffith shot his wife in the head?  She survived the assassination attempt and got a well-deserved divorce. You'll learn allll the details of this crazytown story and waaay way more during your hike!  Somehow, Solomon will manage to give you a great workout, show you spectacular views, and shock you with an intricate history of Griffith Park & Hollywood!

OK... now let's get down to the nitty gritty.  If you're like me, you like to rock your cuteness wherever you go.  You'll probably wear your cute shorts with a cute top and hope to scope out the cute celebs that may be around now that Runyon is closed.  Just make sure that your cute sneakers have a good grip, because we definitely HIKE!

Oooh.  One more word of advice!  Bring a camera!  If you're a tourist and you walk around with a gigantic tourist camera - I'm all "hashtag yaaaaaaaas" for you right now!  It is SO worth it.  The pictures you'll take will blow your mind.  Once you get to the top of the Mount Hollywood Trail, you may even tear up a bit - it's kind of impossible to believe that something so beautiful exists until you see it in person.  If you don't have a fancy schmancy camera - it's all good.  Just be sure to juice up your cell phone battery before the hike - you'll want to put that smartphone camera to #werq!

There's so much more I could tell you, but I can't cheat you out of experiencing this on your own.  You'll get to see mind-blowing views of nature in its purest form, have an impromptu history lesson, see the filming locations of some of your favorite movies (spoiler alert: Charlie's Angels!!), AND burn off all the delicious Mexican food you've been eating!  The San Gabriel Mountains, The Hollywood Sign, the Los Angeles Skyline and a Tighter Waist Line now all have something in common: they're all fabulous perks of Bikes and Hikes LA!</text>

(Translated by Google) tour is definitely worth taking.
I recommend a walking tour of the Griffith Park with an instructor and Kate guide. She showed herself as an expert in her field and an interesting storyteller.
The tracks in the park are also very scenic. You can see the Hollywood sign, a view of the city and Hollywood from above, as well as natural landscapes.

(Original)
тур обязательно стоит взять.
рекомендую пеший тур по парку Гриффит с инструктором и экскурсоводом Кейт. Она проявила себя как знаток своего дела и интересный рассказчик.
дорожки в парке также очень живописные. можно увидеть знак Голливуда, вид на город и Голливуд сверху, а также природные пейзажи.<//review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Our yesterday's 60km bike ride through West Hollywood with George was awesome. Absolute recommendation, you are not stuck in traffic, but still sees a lot and especially places that you would not necessarily visit otherwise. I would particularly recommend George, he is a very talented, funny guide who has a great knowledge & even serenaded from time to time. Thank you!

(Original)
Unsere gestrige 60km- Fahrradtour durch West-Hollywood mit George war fantastisch. Absolute Weiterempfehlung, man steht nicht im Stau, sieht trotzdem eine Menge und vor allem auch Orte die man sonst nicht unbedingt besuchen würde. George würde ich besonders empfehlen, er ist ein sehr talentierter, lustiger Guide der ein großes Wissen & und sogar ab und zu ein Ständchen gesungen hat. Danke!< /Review>< user_id>

Amazing service from this location. Vanessa was over the top helpful, had lots of good information and suggestions, and was very patient with my laundry list of questions. The manager was very nice and seemed genuinely happy to help. The staff helped me look at different plans and promotions and saved me money where I had no idea I could. My transaction ended up taking quite some time because of all the things I was doing, but Vanessa and staff were great the entire time. Can’t express how great our rep was. I highly recommend this location.<//Text>

Huge shout out to Vanessa from the Sierra Vista Mall store. She was very pleasant and provided me with outstanding customer service. She took extra care of my concerns and explained my plan thoroughly. She even stayed after hours to help me set up my new phone, even though it’s part of her job, she never made me feel rush. AMAZING SERVICE!</review>

<Text>Alex M. was absolutely amazing. His customer service skills made me feel at ease. Not rushed and not pressured in any way!  I signed up for AT&T tv with him and he made the process feel extremely smooth! Amongst all the transactions I’ve had with AT&T reps this was definitely my favorite. I’m happy to say you did great Alex! Great job being the change people want to see in this world with customer service!!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

He was extremely helpful with finding what I needed, explaining current promotions and discounts, he was very clear about what my charges were going to be, and even help me quickly transfer over information from one phone to another. I highly recommend using this location for all of your in-store needs. All employees seemed energetic, ready to go, and like they were excited and ready to take on the next customer.<//review>< rate>

<review>Moe was awsome at the At&T store at  serria  vista mall. He set us up with a new phone for our business and set us up with a better plan to save us money.
He even helped set up the new phone the way we wanted it. He was great to work with.
I think he needs a promotion.<//review>< pictures>

Good timing. All workers were busy at making it timely. I wasn't particularly glad my representative was trying to answer other customers' questions while half way in the process with me, but I understand that helped the whole store more than making them wait for just a simple question.< /review>

Today I had a chance to work with Moe at the Sierra Vista AT&T store. The situation that we dealt with was extremely complex and required patience to get a resolution. Moe literally spent hours with me today and I can say that I left the store more than satisfied with the service that I received!< /text>

This lady was so slow, and all we needed was a SIM card. Wait 49 minutes for her to tell us we needed to go to another store. She worked tonight, hope she learns how to be quicker. Looks like she didn’t know how to even set up an account for another customer. So dumb. If I can give zero stars I would.<//Review>

Put my name down to wait for customers to leave the store. A customer was yelling at the door rep, asking him questions, and was able to go inside to be helped out. While I sat on the bench right outside for over an hour. Don't waste my time because you'll never see me inside this store again.<//review>

<review>After waiting patiently for over an hour, I was finally being helped by a Rep.  I was planning on trad-in my phone for the new phone but I was told I was short $2.51 on the value of my phone therefore I could not get the promotion discounts.  I offered to pay that amount to make up for the value of my phone but I was told I could fo that either. REALLY??? I am sure AT&T would be able to do something about that, not like I was $100 short on its value.< /review><userid>106392816274859541856</userid>< Date>

Never return a device to this store. They don't know how to process it, and ATT will bill your account for it months later, and the store associates will have no idea what happened.< /Review>

<text>Made an appointment and went in. Was seen within 10 minutes.
They where having issues with their system because they where So busy with black friday. Which made it a bit slow. They handled the flow of people without missing a beat though. The manager also handled a very disgruntaled customer, who didnt want to wait in line, expertly.
Michael helped me and he was super friendly and knew the answers to my questions reguarding a phone upgrade. He also set me up with a better plan.<//text>< Time>

<Review>Excellent service with Gina! Outstanding with the fact that there's limited space and precautions to Covid-19. Giselle or Bryan (Managers), if you see this, please commend and give her a promotion. Great services are exceptional not only due to trainings and experiences, but also personality and effort. Gina is located at the Clovis ATT store located at Clovis, Ca!< /Review>< Pics>

<review>By far one of the greatest AT&T stores I have been too. I had no other choice yesterday and boy am I glad I did. The staff and Management was a 10/10 compare the last time I have been there! The store Manager (Ali) had amazing knowledge at all products and what will fit me and my family perfectly. Him and the rep lance was amazing they helped me update my cell phone plan and helped me get hbo for free by doing that. I’m also slow when it comes to new technology but these guys were so patient and went over everything with me to the point I was comfortable enough to purchase a new iPad. This by far the best att store I’ve been too, I also live the music they play there at one point i did the tootsie slide with the manager. The people here will genuinely help you out with your best interest in mind. Can’t wait to go and tell people how amazing this place is!</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><review>Well, I was told that I was getting a $350 discount on each of the two IPhone XR's I upgraded to. Then I was told that I would be paying $20/mo for 30 months for each does not make them $350 off per phone when I compare that to the non-sale price of a new XR on line. So I feel a little duped.< /review></record>

< review>
My mother in law wanted to upgrade her iPhone 6 to an iPhone 11Pro, when she arrived and put our name on the list she was told it would be a 20-30 minute wait. After waiting for 30 minutes and still not being helped, I suggested we ask if they even have the phone we wanted to purchase before we wasted any more time waiting. They assured us they had several, so we continued waiting. FORTY-FIVE minutes AFTER we had already waited 30 minutes a girl that had been sitting by the front doors for a while finally came over. We told her what we wanted and she went to the back to go get it. She returned without the phone that we’d been assured was in stock because they only had one. In green. So thank you, for wasting almost an hour and a half of my time for absolutely nothing.< /review>

Long story short I'm done with Verizon and I'm now happy with AT&T thanks to Christian. He is one of the nicest people I have ever met. He was very patient through my ignorance and took the time to get me the right plan and explain everything in detail. All I can say is that the five stars goes to Christian and the level of professionalism and customer service he has.< /review>

<Review>I don't  know if it was because we came in at 620pm and they closed at 7pm or if because it was a Saturday. But when I came in and gave a brief description of what was going on, Letty cut me off and said yeah they had someone come in earlier and can't help me with it. Recommended me to go to Best Buy and go through my insurance or their geek squad. Why couldn't they look at the phone there, or even try? They can't help me go through the insurance I pay them for? She blew me off and said yep, can't help you. Go somewhere else. I pay @$500 a month with my DirecTV service and phones with them, I will be looking to change that if that's the service I'm going to receive.</Review><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1570317158525, 'text': "Hello Joseph Woods Serving our customers with the best service possible is something we strive for every day.

Employees here are trash. Especially Jaquelin, she signed me up for a service I didn’t ask for. I was paying for an unwanted/unneeded service for over 6 months. Thankfully I got all my money credited back. Also they never answer the phone when you call the store.< /text>

I can tell u that it can hit ot miss. Let me explain...If u walk in you may be helped inmediately and 6 people are working or you could be #10 with only two people working. I havent been able to figure out the schedule. My best advice is to schedule an appointment using the ATT app.

Our most recent experience was that we scheduled an appointment for 11:00 and happened to be in the area earlier than expected so we walked in 45 minutes early. Helped immediately. Great experience...this time.<//text>

<Review>This is a very complete store. I was checked in at the door and was told by the greeter that there was only one customer ahead of me and I would be waited on shortly. However, no one came to wait on me. I finally made eye contact with one of the people standing around who sent a customer service person over to help me. All of the customer service people were very knowledgeable and friendly. I was amazed at all of the added expenses when dealing with setting up new service with AT&T.</Review><Name>MiaClovis Clovis</Name>< rating>

Terrible service by the store and entire company. They lie, don't tell you things upfront and scheme to get all the money they can. Definitely leaving at&t for Verizon. Absolutely horrible company from a long time loyal customer. PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND USE A DIFFERENT CARRIER< /text>

This place is a friggin joke.The young Hispanic men working in there are a bunch of stuck-up pricks.The one named Ray couldn't get us out of there fast enough. The other guy went over and told this Ray something and they both laughed and the other guy walked away, this was as we were walking in
Ray didn't really want to help us but he did and he didn't know too much. We are At&t customers but I will never go back to this place again. We took our phones to Best Buy where they were pleased to help us with transfering our old phone info to the new phones.< /review>

I have been waiting for more than 30minutes for someone to help me here at the AT&T store. As a new customer, I'm disappointed because AT&T has a horrible customer service. After waiting 30minutes I told someone if I could get some help because no one asked me if I needed help. AT&T corporate should over see this store because the manager at this location is not telling his employees to do their job. This is a lousy store.< /review>

I turned in my old phone for my account promotion credit.  Made an appointment.
Walked in one hour early and checked-in.
They were able to help me after about 5 minutes!  Moe was my in-store rep.
He is very professional and friendly.
He got me hooked up phat city ! 😁
A very nice store with ample room to walk and look around.  Other staff are nice too.   Sweet!< /review>

CASH ONLY but they are fast, tasty, and a great value. I wish they were open on Sundays! Would be ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ if they had longer hours and were open on Sundays.

Typical tacqueria style value super tacos & super burritos with your choice of meat. Personally, I like their chicken, but the pork & carne asada are good too. FYI: Hot sauce/salsa is kept in squease bottles in the fridge (along with a selection of Mexican sodas). The red salsa is spicier than the salsa verde. They also use only corn tortillas for the tacos, which makes them a good gluten-free option.

Located in that ancient run-down parking lot on Bascom still bearing the name "Dick's Center." They're easy to overlook. Due to their location on the corner of the strip, the glare from the sun can be quite daunting at certain times of day, but many customers seem to grab food to-go, as there are only a few tables indoors and a few tables outdoors anyway.< /text>

They are known for the super taco. You can't go wrong. Loved the place for the good food and nice team. It is a small place, so many folks do a take out, but if you do eat it there it will be nice and hot.< /review>

Any time I drive through or past San Jose I try to stop by Tacos Mexico. My favorite tacos in the world so far. I love the crispiness of one of the layers and the meats are perfectly cooked. Should always get super tacos- they've got excellent avocados.< /Text>

<Review>This looks like a legit mexican place by the way they dont have Tuesday specials. We order the super burrito which was nothing super about it. It was just beans very little avocado, no SALSA, little meat. The only reason I'm giving two star is because the meat was good, surprisingly. Skip it go somewhere else.</Review><GmapID>0x808e34cf3e47c911:0x4e879046e3591d27<//GmapID>< userid>

We live in Sacramento and everytime we go to the bay area we go out of our way for TACOS Mexico. We have been going there for about 15 years. I love this place. We will be seeing you may 19th 2019 for our silver 25th Anniversary.</text>

Not very happy with the service nor the quality of food. Normally the food is excellent but not this time, not sure I really want to go back after the snobby attitude and poor service I received yesterday.< /text>

"Best Tacos! The whole office goes crazy when we find out someone is driving near here at lunch.  Get the beef or chicken tacos as they are affordable and delicious, forgo your leftover tomato soup."</review>

I'm the kind of person who will NEVER order Tacos when I'm out to eat Mexican food. Chimichangas, Burritos, Fajitas, Tortas, Tostadas, Flautas... literally anything sounds better to me than a Taco. And I've tried every item on the Tacos Mexicos menu.

The verdict: Get the tacos. They are so much better than any other item on the menu and the best value at $3 (veggie super tacos are $2.70). They jam pack the super tacos with filling (a high ratio of meat). The cheese is melted in between the tortillas. Make sure you ask to get them extra crispy for a crunchy outside and soft inside you won't be able to resist. My particular favorite is the BBQ Pork. Haven't stomached the beef tongue or pork cheeks (those just sound too weird to me) and haven't tried the chile relleno, but I'd say the BBQ pork is better than everything else (chicken, carnitas, carne asada).

Trust me -- I know you like burritos and tortas, but I've been in that same predicament... I've gotten those just to try something new and every time have immediately regretted not just getting two super tacos for nearly the same price. There's a reason it's called Tacos Mexicos. Get the tacos.< /text>

I've been coming here for awhile now no other place can compare. I'd rather take the hole in the place verse the fancy Mexician Restaurants that serve so call mexican food.....< /text>< pics>

I've had better tacos . Only reason why they get one star because they said they had no salsa and lime 🤦🏻‍♀️ . Like how am I suppose to eat my tacos without the main ingredients. Not cool< /Review>

Not nearly as crowded as TOKYO CENTRAL.  They have a very good selection of everything. Looks like more Japanese from Japan shop here, versus TOKYO CENTRAL  where more HAWAIIAN FOLKS shop at Tokyo Central.<//text>

All of our friends would stop here just to checkout all the new stuff from Hawaiian Island Creations HIC without having to fly to the Islands. Now it's just another boring strip mall with the same stuff at every other corner in Gardena Torrance area.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

If there was less then one star, I would have picked it. Here on a Wedding, and the Bar denied us drinks. They said it’s for “Members Only”. Don’t rent this place you will regret it.<//Review>

Very nice courses. Requires a membership or a member to get you on. Greens are like glass. A little pricey. $60with a cart.< /Review>

<text>Ok this is truly the best golf course in the Bakersfield area. A beautiful course that's well kept and extremely challenging. The staff are very friendly and the course marshall was also very polite and thanked us for our good golf edicate during the tournament. Tough greens and several changes in elevation help keep play fun. I don't have anything negative to say about BCC. I just wish it was a little closer to home.<//text>< pics>

<Text>I had barely sat down and my car was done. The young gentleman that helped me was professional and helpful. They had exactly what my (picky) car needed. The staff was kind and clearly explained what was going on. I’ve been a technician for over 20yrs. and felt comfortable here.< /Text></record>

I am used to a more transparent process for the cost. Didn't show me the oil level or air filter. And you still have to get out of your car to pay when you are done. The lack of communication is the main reason for the low rating. I have had much better experiences for a third of the price. Valvoline is a better choice for this price tier.<//Review>

<Text>The staff in Castro Valley, California were friendly and professional. Upon changing oil, they explained other services provided; however, they weren't trying to pressure me to purchase non- needed services and performed pertinent services in a timely manner. Furthermore, they had thorough records of previous visits and were able to render accurate maintenance recommendations based on model and usage of my vehicle. Lastly, they gave me a good discount.<//Text>< name>

I have spent a month working myself up for a painful visit to get work done on my car.
The work was done in about 1  hour ...no long sale pitch  and moaning or teeth gashing  because I didn't want to buy something .
Just  calm, friendly ,professional service.
So very nice, so very nicely done .
good job jiffy lube.< /Text>

After service drove my car 3 days later. My engine and tire traction lights came on. Drove back home and my husband, who is an auto master tech by trade, checked tires. Then ran the diagnostic program on his laptop which came up with code 171 which is a lean issue. He then found that the air intake hose was unplugged. Luckily my husband was able to fix and knew what to do. I, as a female, with no automobile knowledge was very worried driving with these lights on. Someone else may have had to incur mechanic expenses. Anyway, this was my 2nd time at Castro Valley JL. I don't trust them now. So won't be back.<//text>

Nice staff, very easy to get my fleet vehicle serviced. Electronic documents had wrong (5w30) oil listed so the nice lady tech asked me if I wanted to use the correct 5w20 written on the oil fill cap. Checked all the lights and reset the oil change counter.</review>

Not very thorough and you have to get out of the car to pay. That means walking around the car while it's being serviced. Customers shouldn't be walking around the garage and payment should be touchless. I guess they changed the oil but they didn't do anything else. For $100 I expect a bit more.<//Text>

<review>Nice people, I'll be back. However, they left my air box open when they checked my Engine air filter; my windshield wiper fluid was NOT topped off(stated in final report); and they did not add air to tires(stated in final report). I'll be back because for $33 they will vacuum my floors and change my oil and filter. You just have to look under the hood before you leave.</review>< Pictures>

I love the customer service. It starts before you have a chance to get out of your car.  The service on my car was prompt and efficient. They are a thoughtful group of people. I would encourage people to use this Jiffy lube on Castro Valley Blvd.

This posting is over a year old. It no longer applies. My next visit 11 months later, was the total opposite of previous visit. I was so shocked. I will not be returning.<//review>

This place is a rip off and you will not get what you paid for. Normally I do my own oil changes but on this particular date (12-3-16) I was feeling a little lazy and decided to take it in and just have it done. From the moment my vehicle was brought in for the oil change I watched them service my vehicle step by step from the waiting room. They drove my vehicle into the garage opened up the hood-pulled out the dipstick and removed the oil fill cap. From there they proceeded to the side door which leads downstairs so they can have access to drain plug underneath the vehicle. After about 10 minutes the guy comes back up from downstairs and and starts putting new motor oil into my vehicle and didn't even change my oil filter. The oil filter in my Chevy Equinox is located right by the oil fill cap and can only be removed from the top of the vehicle, Not underneath!  The technician finished doing what he was doing then came inside and told the cashier that my vehicle was ready. (I don't think so)
After talking with the cashier and letting him know what I just witnessed he must've apologized a hundred times out of embarrassment. He then went and had a talk with his technician and from there my vehicle was back in the garage getting a new oil filter.                I don't recommend coming here......<//Review>

They usually do the minimum required to change your oil, then check off a bunch of services they didn't perform.

The management and staff has changed several times in the past few years, but the service still stinks.

I called asking about wait times, and the person answering the phone said, "Saturday is our busiest day, we probably can't fit you in." As I drive by five minutes later, the parking lot was empty, along with all the bays. I needed my oil changed, and Midas was too busy, so I went in. They did an OK job, but charged my extra for "extra oil" (charged me for 4.5 gallons at the 5 gallon and under price, then .5 gallons at the over 5 price).

There are plenty of better options out there.</text>< user>

The two gentlemen there explained that their computer system was down, and that they couldn't take credit cards or print receipts.  Paid cash, accepting their promise that I could come back the next day for a receipt.

The next day, there was no record of my oil having good been changed in their computer,

Evidently, this kind of behavior is of no concern to management, because my complaint through their website was not addressed at all.</text>< user_name>

I never write reviews because Everyone has their own subjective experience. On the other hand I get my car serviced at the Castro Valley Jiffy Lube semi-frequently and the service is consistently exceptional. The facility is clean and organized and they go far beyond their duties. I went for a casual oil change when I was informed they did not have my filter. Instead of not replacing my filter or making me come back David, the associate manager paid for a filter out of pocket from a nearby store.< /review>

<rating>1<//rating><review>I have been coming here for about a year, and have been generally happy with the service.  That all ended today.  When I arrived today, I was told the lower pit staff had just taken lunch, and if i came back in 20 minutes, I could be helped then.

When I returned 23 minutes later, I was told the pit staff still had 15 minutes on their lunch, and I that I had  been given incorrect information about when people started and stopped their break.

Somehow, JiffyLubes inability to staff and communicate properly was my fault,  and Anthony's attitude was "fine leave, I still have 15 minutes on lunch"

In the past I have had to point out little things, like you forgot this, or you left this in the car; but this just goes to show how little they care for their customers, their customers time, and the business as a whole.

Service work is always based on trust.  A good trust measurement for me  has been customer service.  If you do not care how you present to the customer, you don't care about your job. if you do not care about what you do,  I cannot trust you, and I won't do business with you.

I will never be back< /review>< Pics>

<Text>From the moment I stepped out of my truck it reeked of marijuana. They were done with my full size truck in less than 5 minutes and boasted that they "waste no time" and then collected my 75 dollars. I don't think they did anything to my truck except check tire pressure to be honest, as they were laughing the whole 5 minutes. I will never come back again.</Text>< Pictures>

I really loved this location. I normally go to Jiffy lube but the one on Hesperian in San Leandro. The Assistant manager Mia was awesome. She explained everything and gave all of the services that I paid for, not just skimp out on them. Thanks Mia. She really nailed the customer service.</review>

<text>BEWARE - DON’T LET THESE PEOPLE TOUCH YOUR CAR -

On my wife’s car instead of removing the cover to access the filter and drain plug they cut holes in the cover with  saw without permission.  I didn't notice until next oil change.

This is why they wont let you sit in car while they service it.  If I would have heard them using a saw while changing the oil I would have stopped them!</text>< rating>

This facility forgot or neglected to replace an air filter, which I was charged for anyways. I didn't know until I got the vehicle smoged and the mechanics at the smog place caught it missing. Was driving around for quite a while without a filter.. maybe took a few years off the engine as a result. Pretty bummed.< /text>

I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone! I came for an oil change in April 2016. To find out a week after driving my car the technician left my oil cap opened causing oil to burst out every where my check engine came on. I came back to speak to the manager which he didn't seem to give a crap.  He wasn't apologetic at all for his employee's error, all he said was "your next oil change is free". So I'm here today to redeem this oil change. I asked the manager if he could throw in a tire rotation which doesn't cause the company to lose anything he said "No we only agreed to the oil change that's it!" Im just shocked at how crappy this company is and I work in customer service. I would not recommend this place to anyone, and PLEASE CHECK YOUR OIL CAP BEFORE LEAVING! !!</text>

<Review>Great little spot. Right next to the water and a nice boardwalk to walk along the beach without getting down into the sand. The food is really good and they have great beer on tap. It's a bit pricey to be honest for what you get though.</Review><gmap_id>0x80e9acef00219b7f:0xa4fe8f47dd7fe974< /gmap_id>< pics>

<Review>This place came as a suggestion from Google maps. The reviews looked good so we decided to try it. I made a reservation just before sundown. We were lucky enough to get a window seat and the view was gorgeous. The food and service just did not disappoint either! My wife had steak and I had the seared ahi. The prices were not cheap but the food the service and the atmosphere made it all worthwhile. I think we'll be going back.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>I love this place! This is my first time here, visiting from out of town. I love the atmosphere, the servers are all friendly and accommodating and the food is delicious!

They have a whole section for vegetarians/vegans and I really appreciated that. I got the Vegan Bistro Burger and it was absolutely phenomenal.

10/10 will come again next time I'm in town!</text>< Pics>

<Text>Had a 10 person group. They were on top.of everything.  Never waited for a drink, plates cleared, etc.   Natalie was our server and she was great!

Food was well portioned, and very good. Prices are competitive.

I'll definitely be back next time.in town.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80e9acef00219b7f:0xa4fe8f47dd7fe974</gmapID></record>

<Review>The team was efficient and courteous. They give refills on a regular basis. The atmosphere is pleasant, and despite the fact that we arrived during peak hours, we were seated immediately. My son was taking up so much room in the hallway while playing, and they were both polite and respectful. The egg was delicious, and the side dishes were yum-plateful. The portions were sufficient, and quick service was available. Without a doubt, we'll go.<//Review><Rate>4< /Rate><name>Saramon Arias</name><Response>None</Response></record></dataset><record>

<Review>It was our anniversary and we decided to go and have a nice dinner. My problem started when I arrived when I made our reservation I was not asked if I want outdoor or indoor sitting. When they were sitting us they just sat us outside. I requested to be inside I was told if I did not request a preference they automatically sit you outside if I want to eat inside it they had a opening at 830 pm my reservation was at 5:30 they wanted me wait three hours!!!! So we decided to try to make the best of it but to tell you the truth it was cold breeze and could enjoy eating my meal. The heater they had didn't have enough or they didn't work. Now the meal I ordered the Black and Blue Top Sirloin  I asked for medium rare and got it well done I was going to complain but it took so long to get our meal I was afraid it would take longer to get a remake and by this time I was freezing cold . We just p be aid our bill and tried to salvage our anniversary.< /Review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

The vendors at this market station were all friendly and helpful. You don't hesitate to ask them questions, and they've always been able to answer. This farmer's demand piqued my interest because it provided fair rates and prices. One of our city's most well-known farmer's markets!</Text>

<text>The prime rib had a good flavor and was tender, but it was a tad over medium. The top sirloin was excellent, tender, and flavorful, but a tad over medium rare. The sauce was delicious and I wished for a little bread to sop it up.</text><date>1622348510125</date><GmapID>0x80e9acef00219b7f:0xa4fe8f47dd7fe974< /GmapID><rating>4< /rating></record>

The food was excellent! The prime rib was so tender and delicious. The halibut special was enjoyed by my companion. The staff (Ivan) was so helpful with surprising my bf on his birthday. A very enjoyable experience overall.< /Text>

We were shown the menu and taken orders before we sat down, so the food arrived almost immediately. It was breathtakingly beautiful out there.</review>< Rating>

The food was excellent! The prime rib was so tender and delicious. The halibut special was enjoyed by my companion. The staff (Ivan) was so helpful with surprising my bf on his birthday. A very enjoyable experience overall.</Text>

<Review>I will undoubtedly return to this place in the future. I'll continue to involve my family and friends. The most wonderful place! For the right surgery, just the best! I went to this restaurant for the first time, and I'm so glad I did because it's an awesome location. I didn't expect this place to be so incredible.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I had the lunch special which consisted of a large piece of grilled roughy, coconut rice, a large salad and iced tea, all for only $14! An excellent deal imo. And the food was wonderful! The fish was cooked perfectly and not at all overdone. It was so flavorful I didn’t even need the tartar sauce.< /Review>< user_id>

This place is a nice place to enjoy dinner with an ocean view.  Staff is friendly and food is good.  Just order your baseball steak a warmth up. Medium rare is like a seared tuna steak.  But that's both going to keep me away. The filet mignon is delicious<//review>

Amazing food. Lots of options, drinks were a little weak, staff was kind of slow, but very friendly and accommodating, and the manager was extremely nice, amazing location to the beach and our hotel next door.<//text>

$ Service was great. Outdoor seating with an ocean view, yes!
Tried the parmesan crusted white roughy, blackened with an awesome relish. With garlic mashed potatoes. Was pleasantly surprised. Light, great flavor combinations.<//Text>

I visit this place now 3x my first visit was not up to standards. Service was slow .food was cold. So i asked to speak to the manager.  He was very polite. He understood are concerns. So they put part of are meal back on a gift card..its been over 8 months now. I took some friends of mine out to dinner .ding ding .great job .
Aloha .chicken was great .steak was as well. Oh yes spinach dip excellent.  Service was great  oh yes prices are not bad .plan to spend about $40 to $50 per person.  Nice decor as well. Oh yes fish and chips .definitely will feed two. And then take a walk on boardwalk along the beach .definitely going back .</text>

From the minute we stepped in the door we knew we had stepped into a fantastic dinning experience. The service, the food, the atmosphere, was great for our romantic evening. There were groups celebrating, families enjoying family time, and couples enjoying each other all enjoying the evening. I am sure everyone there would give 5 stars to Aloha Steakhouse, I know my lovely lady and myself give Jason and the entire staff 5+ for a very memorable evening. A definite place to enjoy.</review>

The wedge salad is amazing. Also check out the bananas foster if you want dessert.

Wait staff was great and there's a nice outdoor seating area. A little pricey but you could definitely get worse food for more other places on the pier.

Definitely worth it.< /Text>

Not fancy, just excellent for what it is. It's in a beautiful location, one of the few seaside restaurants in Ventura, and the food is good for the price. We've never had a bad experience. The staff are always helpful and glad to see you.</review>

<review>Go on an off-night (if there is such a thing at Harris') and ask for a booth so the two of you can whisper and getclose in between courses.

The best steak of my lifetime in a plushy yet not stuffy atmosphere. And, a sommelier who knows his stuff who will find that elusive taste, be it jammy Napa red or mineral-y white. Even the clams in garlic/white wine sauce are good- at a steak house!

Thank you Harris' for doing it right.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80e9acef00219b7f:0xa4fe8f47dd7fe974<//GmapID></record>

<text>This place was surprisingly packed. They ran out of prime rib fast and we booked a 7:15 dinner reservation. The filet mignon was very good so that was a nice alternative. I would like to mention that I booked a reservation through the online Google tool and it didn't connect to their system, so we showed up with no reservation marked down. Luckily they were able to seat us immediately. Hopefully Google will fix that bug.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

We come here on special occasions, and last nite was no different. 47th wedding anniversary. The meals this time were just "ok". Not bad, just not as our past visits. Even with  Covid, the meals should have been better. A real disappointment was no hot bread; we were told it was due to Covid. (Not sure why that would be). May try somewhere else on our next special day.< /review>

OMG this place is Da Bomb! Ivan our server was terrific! He was talkative with all of us and made us feel like we knew him personally. This guy deserves a raise!! No Seriously he does. He made our dinner experience even more special. Especially because it was my daughter's birthday. He even tried to help me surprise my daughter with her Volcano Chocolate Souffle.That was one amazing dessert our dinner party loved. Prime Rib, Rib-Eye and Garlic Mashed Potatoes are a must try. Oh ya did I mention Ivan is a terrific server :). Next time we come back Ivan has to be our server. Even if we have to wait.< /Review>

Going to this restaurant was a great experience. It is conveniently located close to the beach and the pier. The outdoor dining experience was nice overall. The food and cocktails were great and the presentation of them was adorable.</text>

I visit this place now 3x my first visit was not up to standards. Service was slow .food was cold. So i asked to speak to the manager.  He was very polite. He understood are concerns. So they put part of are meal back on a gift card..its been over 8 months now. I took some friends of mine out to dinner .ding ding .great job .
Aloha .chicken was great .steak was as well. Oh yes spinach dip excellent.  Service was great  oh yes prices are not bad .plan to spend about $40 to $50 per person.  Nice decor as well. Oh yes fish and chips .definitely will feed two. And then take a walk on boardwalk along the beach .definitely going back .</Review>

Most hotel restaurants are just so so because they have a captive audience. This steakhouse is above-average, has good steaks and lots of seafood choices. A bit pricey, but it is right down by the beach and the boardwalk!</text>

<Rating>3< /Rating><review>Service was great, food was so-so.  My filet mignon was well-cooked medium rare, but the "peppercorn" sauce was way too overpowering (i make a much better peppercorn sauce), and the baked potato skin was WAY TOO OVERSALTED.  My wife's spicy ahi was tough and contained too much membrane connective tissue.  Not terrible, but for the price ($144.84 with tip) one might expect more like true steak house quality (eg, Ruths Chris, or McCormick & Scmitt's).  Maybe OK for Ventura, but not for LA or SF Bay Area.  But the service was great.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN52KT5l9_m29ukQgZOsCjEF-GldXIMzm6qKxFL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_hjF3KTEgzyD_kRdQaynrtxXV78eHyHLe9XgD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZTbIt-0QPDQ_F5Soye3K87iHF0wa5Xs_1K7o-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

The food was superb. My king crab legs were fresh and delicious. The lobster chowder was absolutely satisfying with big chunks of claw meat. Hubby had the black and bleu filet mignon with a lobster tail and wedge salad which he thoroughly enjoyed.

Their service was outstanding. We were there on Easter Sunday, as our original plans fell through. The entire staff went above and beyond to make sure our 5 year old was entertained by hiding eggs for him to find.

Last but not least, tableside bananas foster. Nuff said.

The entire experience was definitely 5-star worthy!<//Text>

My Filet Mignon Was the Best I ever had. But my husband's Prime Rib was so so. No flavor. The table was sticky, a dirty fork under my feet. Our server was not into it I guess. Not on his game, at least not for us.<//review>

Took my boyfriend here for his birthday. The service was impeccable and so was the food! Definitely coming back! I had the lobster tail and baked potato with the works and he had a ribeye and baked potato. And he got a complimentary Kona birthday cake!🥳🥳🥳<//Review>

Kiss fingers! The lobster stuffed mushrooms were flavor filled. The filet mignon was juicy and tender! The loaded baked potato was buttered well I needed no salt! Great house salad blend! And the volcano soufflé topped it off! The Heath bar added a great crunch to the dessert!< /Text>

My only suggestion would be the mash potatoes need to be a bigger portion, I finished it prior to my meat so I was eating it alone.  It was a very small portion. I would definitely repeat.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

From the moment we walked in this place and the staff were a delight. Our hostess was so sweet and even inquired if we were celebrating a special occasion, which we were. Our waiter, Jason, was the best! Such a friendly and funny guy plus super attractive. The food was delicious and done to perfection. But that neat part was the Creme Brulee at the end.

<Text>Food and location was great. Waiters/waitresses were slow, messed up some of the drinks, and gave off false enthusiasm. Very expensive with fairly average portions. Worth going if the attitude of the waiters/waitresses doesn't kill your mood.</Text>< Pics>

Excellent service. Great steak. Great atmosphere. Visited during County Fair so think we missed the crowd. Also went closer to closing,  still received exceptionally great service!</Review>

<review>The food is amazing. Four stars because waitress seemed preoccupied and hard to get anything needed at table. Little pricey to take 4 kids. Plates are around $30 each. Very nice setting out on the patio.< /review>< pics>

Best service hands down. Food is to die for. Right on the beach and convenient if staying at the Crowne Plaza. Treated us like it was our birthday. Why? Because that's the level of service they aim for every time we go! They are quite enthusiastic about their Bananas Foster!! Impressive.<//Text>

Food was excellent and our waiter was very friendly and patient.
Glad to be able to have a nice dinner in Ventura. Hope we will be able to have dinners inside again soon, since not all restaurants in Ventura have the possibility to serve dinners outside.</Review>< Pictures>

Centrally located, Aloha Steakhouse is the ONLY beach restaurant. It has a Hawaiian influence, serving variety of entrees such as chicken, steak, seafood and fish. The menu features an array of contemporary lunch and dinner favorites, plus Island specialties and decadent desserts.

At time of visit, they offered patio dining only, reservation recommended as seating on patio is limited. Tables were 6 feet apart, but despite the distance, local patrons of this place were very friendly. Also at time of visit, fencing was placed around the patio area. There is a spacious, full-service bar (you may order but can not drink inside) offering a wide variety of craft cocktails, martinis and beer.

Our server was very friendly. Because the menu was extensive, she was happy to make suggestions based on our taste that evening. We chose Teriyaki Chicken Kabob on bed of rice and Seared Scallops with spinach and cream sauce, which we paired with Chandon split and Mai Tai (a little strong but it hit the spot!). The chicken and scallops were quite tender, scallops fresh and seasoned well.

We were little full by end of our meal, but curious about desserts. We decided to pass, but our server was kind enough to comp a house favorite, Kona Pie - Macadamia nuts, ice cream on Oreo cookie, topped with bittersweet chocolate syrup and whipped cream. It was quite rich, but we enjoyed every bite, saving a few bites for later that evening.

There was a fantastic casual vibe here, and the food was fantastic. We will visit this restaurant again the next time we are in the area.</Review>

<review>If you are looking for a casual yet semi fancy restaurant on the beach in Ventura this is a great place to go. It is right on the beach and the food was amazing. I got a weird entre that was like a sweet white roughy and it was really good.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Terrific prime rib and wifey loved her salmon! 3 adult beverages and really good cheesecake for dessert...$93+tip.  Great service outside on back porch with our pups, watching the sun sink into the ocean.<//review>

<text>Tasty steakhouse on the Ventura pier. Upscale dining offering prime rib and steaks including a rare and blue, baseball filet, and peppercorn and mushroom sirloins. Ahi salad included a nice portion or rare ahi. Wedge salad dressed with the perfect amount of bacon, red tomatoes, and chunky blue cheese dressing. Booths and tables as well as seating for large parties available. Jacket potatoes were delicious with flaky with salt crusted skin. Perfect for special celebrations.</text><Pics>None</Pics><rate>5< /rate><date>1596962640493< /date>< gmap_id>

It came with one side (leaving me to choose between a vegetable or a starch).  I didn’t feel my meal would be complete with just one side and after seeing another tables plate with the small side of vegetables, definitely knew I wouldn’t be satisfied we just that as I side, so I paid extra for mashed potatoes.  For my meal of almost $40, I felt this was way over priced.  Service was fair.  Scenery and ambience were nice.</Text></record>

Great food, great atmosphere and great service! I had the herb roasted chicken and it was perfect. Our server James was amazing too! Very funny, kept us laughing and was prompt with everything. Highly recommend the place.<//Review>

<Text>Haven't been here in a while and when I had my first bite I wondered why it took me so long to go back. Had the steak and my wife had the salmon both dishes were great and the service was just as fantastic. I wish I could remember our server/ hostess name she was really nice and great. Hope to go back soon.</Text>< pics>

<review>Mahalo!✌ At last, after a long-time cravings, out-of-the-blue i was here at lest enjoying one of the best dinner-out with my loving family, yet by far 😉 Location wise, a total knocked-out & dropped-dead gorgeous view to-die-for: witnessing up-close and personal the magnificent "SUNSET" along the shoreline of Ventura. Food-wise, you have to try your own faves and of-course their famous signatures and the chef's recommendations (for those who love surprises, lol 🤣) and the best among all is their outstanding accommodation, friendly environment and ambiance of great satisfaction that you truly deserve. The pricing is just and just righteous, a chic and posh set up, and yet an arm-to-reach experience, that you can have this anytime you want. And btw, parking is free by the side of the building just don't forget to validate your ticket once done. Add a little romantic moment of a walk-to-remember experience while looking at the horizon. Additional memory lane that is truly priceless and timeless 🤗😍👌< /review>< pics>

Came here from Colorado to celebrate my sons birthday. He heard good things and wanted to try. We ordered the king crab legs.  They were cold, and rubbery.  This was 3 legs cut in half at 70$  REALLY?  My wifes mashed potatoes were also cold. She enjoyed her fish. Expected alot more for the money.  I've had warmer, better crab at Red Lobster in Denver.  Meal was below average and disappointing. Do better!< /text>

My girlfriend and I was staying at the hotel across the street (Crowne) we were going to order take out for our room but the Venue is absolutely amazing and I recommend calling ahead and request for a table with ocean view.. Our dinner was great with had Sautéed Mushrooms (big recommend) Ribeyes and a Great Kona Pie. The service was the best we have had in a LONG time. Melissa the first night.. The service was so good we had to come back the next night on our 2 day vacation we got a great waiter named Peter we hope to come see him again!! I would recommend this place to any of my friends and family the music was also a big plus, 70s/80s music With nice artists. Wish I could rate it higher then 5. We are coming back 🙏🏼</review>

We had such an amazing experience here. Great wine selection and our server, was beyond five stars. It was literally the BEST service I have had in my life, ever. I could go on and on, but I would say, ask for Jenny to be your server when you go. You will not be disappointed. The food is amazing and it was served very fast</text>

I've never paid $200+ for a meal that no one wanted to finish.  The server was very kind, and did comp us for one of the steaks, but overall I would not suggest coming here and expecting anything beyond an overpriced meal.</Review><pics>None</pics>< rate>

Best burger I've had in a long time! If you like when you are asked how you would like your burger cooked and it is served as ordered, don't pass it up on the menu for other options. The food and drink quality truly match the beautiful view. Will definitely return!</Review>

<review>The ahi was served cold and the asparagus was undercooked. The mashed potatoes were cold and the cocktails were average. We chose to enjoy our first anniversary here, and will not return. Sadly.< /review>< pics>

We had such an amazing experience here. Jenny, our server, was beyond five stars. It was literally the BEST service I have had in my life, ever. I could go on and on, but I would say, ask for Jenny to be your server when you go. You will not be disappointed. The food is amazing!< /text>

Service is good, but the prices are too high for what you get. I had the Macadamia nut crusted Mahi, and for $33.00 the piece of fish was about 2x6 inches. It was good but the portion sizes are quite small for the price.<//text>

I had my meal and was out of there well within thirty minutes. I ordered their most basic hamburger and it was cooked to a perfect, juicy medium rare...even though I didn't request it.  Relaxing, calm dining atmosphere and you can't beat the view of the beach outside.

<review>Normally the food and service are good at Aloha. But this time my rib eye steak was overcooked (the same for my nephew's rib eye), and the waiter got the drink orders wrong twice. Two members of our party ordered the prime rib, and that seemed to be fine.<//review>< pics>

<review>Poor management makes it hard to enjoy.

After making reservations for an evening we get a call that a larger party bought out the evening and had to change nights. Ok...

Then the night we go it's 1 server per 8-10 tables. No bread after it was promised several times. No crayons for the kids coloring menu, and really long times between server visit made it for a rough nights with kids.

The one redeeming quality is they were willing to split plates with generous portions.< /review>< pictures>

<review>I was overcharged for a drink that I did not have. I asked twice to have the charge removed and the waiter made every excuse not to remove it. We were a very large group and there was no reason for him to scam for extra money. I will NEVER patronize this establishment again.<//review>< Pics>

Update to my previous post, we went back to celebrate my husband's birthday and thing have changed. We made reservations a week ago and were seated in the doorway. When asked about  moving, we were told that the booths were reserved. No one sat in them the whole time we were there. Instead we sat in a cold breeze from the back door. The waitress was disengaged and seemed annoyed and distracted. The salad was room temperature and the dinner was bland.  Moral of this review, if you want filet mignon go to Trader Joe's and buy the center cuts, potatoes and a bag of salad and save yourself about $60. and enjoy a quiet evening.<//Text>

What a yummy happy hour and dinner in the bar. Great chowder. The fish and chips were fantastic. Wedge salad was delicious and a bargain at the price for a half wedge. The service was fast and with a great smile, from Addison. Skilled bartender for sure!
We can’t wait to go again when we return to Ventura next month.< /Text>

Great place, nice view. I've passed by this restaurant for years and kept intending to go. I wish I had gone to sooner. The food was absolutely delicious I had the salmon. The staff was sweet if they could possibly be. They just had a stabbing from a homeless person about two nights before we went. I think this has scared away a lot of patrons. I felt safe as I can possibly be. I hope people continue to support them and the restaurant sticks around for a long time.</text>

I am so disappointed ... its OK to spend arm and leg at your place, but as soon as customer walks out of your restaurant, you point them to public restroom. such a low class.< /review>

<review>I was scouting for a good place to have a lunch date and its perfect. Great service beautiful smiling faces. Clam chowder was a little thick for my taste but plenty of little clam pieces. I order the Ahi appetizer, it was awesome. The chicken kabobs were delicious. I will give it a five.<//review>< Pictures>

I wish I could rate zero stars. I came here with my husband and 5 month old son. We waited at our table for 20 mins and were never served so we ended up leaving. One of the waitresses was just sitting there talking to the hostess doing absolutely nothing. While we were waiting I was also super disappointed in the menu because they don’t even have steak for lunch</text>

Their outdoor patio is comfortable, it's dog-friendly  (a huge plus!), they have great salads, clam chowder and burgers, and today our server couldn't have been more accommodating. The water view ain't bad, either! Definitely a fave... a must try! 😊< /Text>< Rating>

Stopped in for dinner while on a recent trip looking forward to some great sea food--I was not disappointed.  The staff were friendly and helpful with recommendations.  The food was incredible and the atmosphere was great.  I was seated with a view of the ocean.  I couldn't ask for more.</text>

Friday night was extremely busy, so we decided to sit in the bar at a little table by the window. Waitress was extremely busy trying to manage everyone so everything took a little bit longer....but she made up for it by giving us a free drink and comping our dessert!
Wife had the almond crusted halibit and I had the prime rib. Dinner came out hot and perfectly cooked to order, it was a fantastic meal. Everything was clean and I would come back here easily!<//Review>

Really yummy food, nice atmosphere and friendly staff. We came in at the end of the night and they ran out of few dinner options by the time we ordered our food. Our server was honest and nice about it so not a big deal. He forgot our salads and just brought our entrees first and then went back for the salads. We liked our server and we cut him a lot of slack. Overall a good experience!<//text>

Had a good time with 7 others. The food is excellent.  The waiter Kenny is expert level and you should ask for him if you go. The price is not cheap but I think for the quality of food, ambiance, and the location next to the beach that 50 per person average making moderate choices is typical.  They do have happy hour, appetizers, and excellent desserts so you have choices to keep the bill reasonable.   Indoor and outdoor seating with small tables and large tables it is a good choice for groups or dinner just for two.</review>

My blue cheese burger was excellent, large and tasty.  Others in my group had the clam chowder and the fish & chips.  All were described as excellent!!  The view of the ocean from the patio is as good as it gets.  Prices are a little steep, but ocean views don't come cheap.  Don't forget to get your parking ticket validated for free beach front parking.</review>

A great steak place right at the beach. Every meal we've had at Aloha has been unquestionably excellent: the food is great and the drinks, too. The waitstaff is always courteous. attentive and knowledgeable. One thing, it can get crowded (which is not unexpected).</text>

Aloha offers a unique experience in the dinning hall. Unfortunately they do not offer a unique experience with their menu. We were disappointed in the selection and the options for preparation. The "gluten free" menu was simply a list of dishes that had or didn't have gluten. It was not reassuring to us. The service was adequate and made us feel well cared for. But for the money, the food is just underwhelming.<//text>

The food, ambience, and views are great. I recommend the blackened salmon and wedge salad. The server was super friendly although she didn't hear my desert order.  My only complaint is the acoustics. It can get very noisy when it is crowded.  I would gladly eat here again.<//text>

Love this place! Great location. Great food and a great staff! I don't give 5 stars lightly. So, when I do, it deserves a little attention. This place has something for everybody. If your a seed eater, you can do a lovey salad menu treat. If you like to eat, on the other hand, get a steak!! It's all good, and considering they're located right on the beach, the prices are very reasonable. Charnell is the best. We love her...</text>

My only complaint is that the owner was discussing the downsides of business ownership with a couple at the bar who also owned a business in the area. Pro tip: don't discuss the burden of having to pay minimum wage to your employees, or any other burdens of owning a business, in front of customers. If that customer happens to be sympathetic to the worker side of the equation, you look like an idiot.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

It was good, but it is a more pricy restaurant. I got the Teriyaki Chicken and it tasted very good, very savory with some sweet mixed in. Overall a decent restaurant, but your wallet may take a hit if you aren't expecting to pay $25+ for one meal.</Review>

Celebrated our son’s graduation lunch at Aloha Steakhouse and it was a wonderful delicious dining experience!  The food was delicious, our entire crowd of 26 family members all enjoyed the food.  Everyone couldn’t stop raving about food. We would all rate the food five stars; we left with satisfied tummies.
The service was totally great and five stars as well.  Charnel and Rachel were so wonderful, they are the best examples of excellent service!!! We will definitely be returning.  Thank you for such a fine dining experience!!!!</text>

<Rating>3<//Rating><Review>The food was good, the soup could have been hotter, the artichoke & mushrooms was good. The mayo could have been colder & fresher or a mayo sauce, or something a bit more creative than warm congealing mayo? IDK or I'd be the uber genius getting 15 bucks for an artichoke. The butter & lemon was really nice.  a bit on the high end price wise. We had a medium group service started out, good, drinks give a few more minutes for our stragglers. No big deal. But then service took a nosedive. We had to ask for everything from cutlery to where are our entrees, one of our party had to wait more than 10 minutes after everyone else was served. There were a few other issues. The people were very nice. I think there was an unexpected rush & we suffered for it. I think once you get one order mixed up with another table & party then the whole thing kinda unravels, it is hard to recover after that point. We all normally tip 20 to 30% but they pre-added an 18%tip. So once our service was a lost cause we didn't add extra.

<Text>It was good, but it is a more pricy restaurant. I got the Teriyaki Chicken and it tasted very good, very savory with some sweet mixed in. Overall a decent restaurant, but your wallet may take a hit if you aren't expecting to pay $25+ for one meal.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

No messing with extra plates and splitting them at the table, even the salads came from the kitchen separately plated. No quibbles about splitting and they did it for us. That is a mark of a really good restaurant. Food was top notch. We each had a drink, the martini was outstanding, the wine was good. The guys had Sam Adam's Octoberfest beers. Good times.<//Text>< pictures>

<response>None<//response><Name>mad honeybee<//Name><text>The food was good, the soup could have been hotter, the artichoke & mushrooms was good. The mayo could have been colder & fresher or a mayo sauce, or something a bit more creative than warm congealing mayo? IDK or I'd be the uber genius getting 15 bucks for an artichoke. The butter & lemon was really nice.  a bit on the high end price wise. We had a medium group service started out, good, drinks give a few more minutes for our stragglers. No big deal. But then service took a nosedive. We had to ask for everything from cutlery to where are our entrees, one of our party had to wait more than 10 minutes after everyone else was served. There were a few other issues. The people were very nice. I think there was an unexpected rush & we suffered for it. I think once you get one order mixed up with another table & party then the whole thing kinda unravels, it is hard to recover after that point. We all normally tip 20 to 30% but they pre-added an 18%tip. So once our service was a lost cause we didn't add extra. We do understand how one order malfunction can disrupt a server's flow, and throw them off. So we will put it down to overwhelmed because other than that everyone was really nice. Even the surrounding customers were all very nice folks.<//text>< Time>

<text>One of the best meals I've had visiting Ventura! Lucky for me they didn't have the stuffed chicken I had decided on (although I'm sure its delicious too) so I ordered the baseball teriyaki steak! A.Mazing! Teriyaki sauce was light and just and accent to a beautiful, delicious steak. Even their house salad is a masterpiece of flavors with diced tomatoes, cucumbers, red peppers and feta with balsamic dressing.  Sigh I can go home happy now! Thanks Aloha steak! And the service was great. Definitely recommend!</text>< Pictures>

Great wine selection.  The decor is pleasant.  We were seated at a great little quiet corner.  Nice romantic little spot behind the partition to the front desk.   The service was at the ready.  Our appetizer was the stuffed artichoke.  That's unusual to find,  but very tastey. The garden salad was chilled and fresh. We had the filet mignon which were cooked to our desired perfection. The desserts are just as yummy as the rest.   It was a Friday night,  so we were delighted that they seated us right away. I would definitely recommend this place for date night.< /review>

<text>I found the food to be average and pricing to be high, my $40 halibut was only about 6oz, very thin and overcooked. Sent it back and ordered the mahi which was decent.  Kids ordered steak it was flavorful but chewy...would have been a decent meal for under 100 but for 200 the food should be better.<//text>< pictures>

<review>My mother and I spent the weekend in Ventura and we decided to check this place out. The hostess was able to get us an ocean view table and the view was beautiful! We both had the black and blue cheese top sirloin with potatoes and a Caesar salad. The steak was cooked perfectly and the salad had classic Caesar dressing. Our waiter Avery was very friendly and helpful. This place was a great find. It's not too expensive for a nice restaurant; it wound being $120 for the two of us. That included a cocktail, wine with the meal and tip. I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you're in the area.<//review><name>Elise Littleton<//name>< Pictures>

<Text>It's become a favorite lunch spot for me and my wife when we are in the Ventura Beach area. The last time we were there, all we needed was the image of the cobb salad on the menu, and we were sold. It was exactly right, hand with a glass of white wine each, we were very happy.<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>We were sat quickly, but the wait staff that was supposed to serve us never showed. I ordered a filet which was tough and the mashed potatoes tasted like instant potatoes. My partner's coconut shrimp was also just okay. It was a beautiful environment and the staff was nice, but the food was just disappointing.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

<Time>1515341574518<//Time><text>I hosted a Baby Shower here for my beautiful niece, and it was simply marvelous! Charnell helped me organize the PERFECT luncheon! She printed out special menus on beautiful paper, made my guests a delightful champagne punch, complete with berries, which made it look lovely and taste delicious! We sat on the patio, and our tables were arranged, so we all had stunning views of the ocean! The service was excellent! Rachel and Julie took extra good care of us, bringing our food, which was SCRUMPTIOUS, and refilling water glasses, in stealth mode, so our party was never interrupted!  Two handsome young men kept our tables neat and tidy at all times! A wonderfully delightful time was had by all! I thank Charnell and her capable staff and HIGHLY recommend Aloha Steakhouse for your next gathering, whether it be 2 or 22! We will definitely return for more aloha from Aloha!</text>< response>

Over priced and not that great. But pretty much what you would expect for a tourist area. If you are at the beach and don't want to leave, it's a good place to grab a bite. But I wouldn't go it if my way to go there.< /Text>

Poor service.  Poor quality of food.  Overpriced.

Beautiful view of the ocean and pleasant atmosphere.  I am so disappointed to come to SoCal and have so-so wine and overpriced fish.  ☹️<//Text>

Food was okay. Serving size much smaller than expected. Service (drink refills) were prompt. The creme brulee was divine.</Text>

<Text>The service was just OK.  We went at night, on a Sunday evening--so we could not see the view of the water.  It was not crowded, however, the waitress did not offer us a table by the window.
The waitress may have had a difficult day, but the bus boy was not really friendly either.
The prices are moderately high, though not as inflated as in Santa Barbara and Monterey. The décor is average, the booth we sat in was comfortable.
The food was average, nothing really outstanding. The waitress did not offer us more bread while we waiting for our meal.  She did bring three different types of herbal tea, which was nice. My husband ordered coffee, and it was freshly brewed.
Overall, I would say it is  a bit over rated.  If you are tired after a day at the beach, it might be a convenient choice--however, don't come in here in your beach attire!<//Text>< user_id>

It was two of us dining in. Hostess said outside was available but went off looking for the server in that section... after watching her walk passed us three times she finally sat us. The margarita  I ordered was so sweet I had to water it down talk about over doing it with the margarita mix! Also I had the calamari and the Parmesan roughy with a Caesar salad. I'm not sure what made me sick but I finished the calamari and Caesar salad, took one bite of the rubbery roughy and then my stomach said it's puke time. Not impressed.<//text>

<user_id>113044232859320303627</user_id><review>Made a request for a reservation via email, got an auto-reply "will hear back from us in 24-hours"  and never heard back.   Called them a week later and requested a seaside table, which they said they took down.
Upon arrival we were placed in the booth next to the restrooms and was told they didn't write down my request.  We waited 15 minutes for our water, and our meal was good, however, do not count on these guys to get your request right on reservations.  Not cool for a 10-year wedding anniversary gift to have that happen.  We are from out of state too, so we had nowhere else to go.  2-stars because the food was good, but they lacked basic table reservation information.</review>< Gmap_id>

<Response>None</Response><Review>Amazing view of the ocean with excellent steaks and seafood!  For maximum effect, try to be here before sunset!

We met another couple for dinner here on a week-night.  I knew it would be busy so I had a reservation, which was available as soon as we arrived.

They quickly took our drink orders, as well as offering bread and apps, but gave us time to chat and didn't make us feel "rushed" to eat and get-out.  Two of us ordered seafood (salmon and roughy) and two had steaks (rib-eye and teriyaki).  Everything was properly prepared and served hot.

They DO validate parking at the nearby parking deck, so we didn't end-up paying anything for parking.<//Review>< Date>

Good food. Our waitress was not the best but everyone else was very kind. Wonderful atmosphere and view. About $25-$40 per plate though so bring your pocketbook.< /text>

<Review>Amazing view of the ocean with excellent steaks and seafood!  For maximum effect, try to be here before sunset!

We met another couple for dinner here on a week-night.  I knew it would be busy so I had a reservation, which was available as soon as we arrived.

They quickly took our drink orders, as well as offering bread and apps, but gave us time to chat and didn't make us feel "rushed" to eat and get-out.  Two of us ordered seafood (salmon and roughy) and two had steaks (rib-eye and teriyaki).  Everything was properly prepared and served hot.

They DO validate parking at the nearby parking deck, so we didn't end-up paying anything for parking.<//Review><Name>Daniel Sherer</Name></record>

< review>
Arrived for dinner on a Sunday.  Had a hankering for steak.  Choose this place from the few places I quickly scanned.  You need to use the public parking garage adjacent to the restaurant but the restaurant will validate your parking ticket.  Was deciding between the ribeye or filet mignon.  Decided to try the ribeye thinking that it has to be good, given this is a steak place.  Had a choice of three salads, decided on something called the wedge which was iceberg lettuce with blue cheese dressing, bacon bits, tomatoes and maybe something else - very good.  Then the steak with steamed vegetables.  The veggies - good.  The steak - very disappointing; too thin, not a good cut and too salty.  Needed A1 with it.  Saw something on the desert menu I wanted to try for desert - kono ice cream pie with slivers of nuts on top - very good; by far the best part of the meal.  My search for a good steak goes on.  This place will stay in business because of the sides and deserts but in my opinion, the steaks are lacking here.</review>

<Text>Calamri for apps and 1st swing & miss,  they were less than ideal. Ordered the black & blue filet medium rare for $40 and 2nd swing & miss. Filet was still mooing, covered in this horrible sauce.Wife had sea scallops 3rd swing and miss they were swimming in a bowl of butter & oil. Will never go back didnt live up to the hype if you go goodluck.</Text>< Pictures>

<text>Our bartender was PHENOMINAL!!!! It unfortunately was his last day, but he was so knowledgable and super friendly.

< Review>
Best ribeye in Ventura!  Kenny is the best waiter.  Mudpie is the best dessert.  That's three "bests" which is definitely a 5 star review.  The place is romantic and near the pier and water.  If you don't get Kenny, the service is suspect but still worth the 5 star because the food does it all.  Great date, birthday, impress the inlaws spot!  Lol</Review>

Let's first talk about the staff at this establishment...they are off the charts.  EVERYONE is friendly and they all work so well as a team.  We met the manager thst evening, Charnel was her name, and she was a true gem.  She brought us cozy blankets because it was chilly outside and she thought we may need them.

Food wise...AMAZEBALLZ!!!!!  Everything we ordered was brought out as ordered.  Appetizers were delish and came out pretty quickly as well as the main entrees.  Nothing was a miss here.

We were a loud group so I'm grateful we sat outside but we were never asked to quiet down or stifled at all, which was nice.

Lastly, Taylor, our waiter, was impeccable.  He was so attentive and thorough!!!  The service he provided is rare and sought after when dining out.  I can't toot his home enough, he was AWESOME!!!!

Thank you Aloha for being the amazing place you are!!!< /review>

<Review>Had a rib steak and it was flavourful and very tender. The wine list was quite good and had the Meiomi from Napa Valley- a Pinot that’s very reasonably priced and one of the best Pinot’s for a lower price that you’ll find anywhere in the world. The service was good too.

I would compare this to Ruth Chris in Pasadena where I had the pleasure of eating a while back also. Not going to be your “haut cuisine”, but for spending above fast food prices, this is great. We have a place called “The Keg” here in Vancouver Canada and sometimes the cuts are tough like leather. Never had those problems here.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>3 stars for food and one for location
Nice staff, not too long woait even in busy periods but my food did come a full 10 min before my beer. That's too long.
The quality of the food I've had is 3 stars woth, relative to price and location a solid 4 star experience.
I would recommend this place to others for a solid meal, but not for those whose seek the premium

Best ribeye in Ventura!  Kenny is the best waiter.  Mudpie is the best dessert.  That's three "bests" which is definitely a 5 star review.  The place is romantic and near the pier and water.  If you don't get Kenny, the service is suspect but still worth the 5 star because the food does it all.  Great date, birthday, impress the inlaws spot!  Lol< /review>

< Review>
Went there a while ago for our anniversary dinner. World Series was on in the bar and the waiter was completely distracted, so the service was pretty poor and the food did not compensate.
My wife had teriyaki steak that seemed about "Sizzler" quality with some syrupy over sweet sauce on it. The fish I ordered seemed to be cooked ok, but had some bizarre sauce on it that I scraped off.
Yes, they're on the promenade.. but we were at an interior table, so no view.
There are really SO MANY better choices in Ventura for the price. Zack Cafe and Lure to name a couple.< /Review>

<review>I wouldn't classify this establishment as a "steakhouse".
Service was extremely slow and subpar. When looking at the menu all the steaks came with some strange heavy smothering sauce to mask the extremely poor quality of the meat. On top of the weird sauce and poor meat, with sitting outside they refused to attempt their signature flambeau table side service even with the patio being protected with clear tall glass barrier. Speaking of the patio, it lies next to the main walkway for the public to stop and stare at you as if you were a caged lion with the look of defeat in your eyes. With the massive barrier surrounding the patio it made the environment stale and stuffy, negating the beautiful ocean breeze and sounds.
As we left a very stiff, stuffy, stale, half eaten dinner at the supposed "steakhouse" a woman, smoking just past the doors of the "steakhouse" asked of we enjoyed our dinner with great enthusiasm and hope. Our response was "if you're waiting to eat there don't..." as we explained our disappointing dinner. She quickly changed her enthusiasm to dismay, "well, we didn't expect such a large crowd tonight."  Which led me to believe she was apart of the "steakhouse". As if being crowded, isn't that what you want as a business, is an excuse for the lackluster performance by the "steakhouse".
With all this being said, the ONLY reason we had dinner at this "steakhouse" is because we had a gift card. If I were to get another gift card or offered a free meal at this "steakhouse" I would not return. I would probably give it to a local homeless individual and my guess is they would not accept the insulting offer.< /review><GmapID>0x80e9acef00219b7f:0xa4fe8f47dd7fe974< /GmapID><rating>1< /rating>< time>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>It's like Cheers when we're in from Oregon; everyone knows our name. I highly recommend the Mantini. It's not on the menu, but just tell Austin or Jasmine to make Jason's Mantini and you'll get the greatest fufu drink this side of Oxnard.

I almost forgot. They will sometimes let you make a fort out of the cushions for the patio furniture. You have to ask and you need to know the code word. Unfortunately, I can't be responsible for sharing the code word. Best of luck and Godspeed.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

It's a shame when terrible service ruins a good menu and vibe. Don't come here hungry or thirsty cause they don't give two craps how long you wait.</Text>

My wife and I went to the Aloha Steak House to celebrate our 51st wedding anniversary. All they could say is happy anniversary, the noise level was very loud and the prime rib was not what we expected, also over priced for what you received and slow service<//Text>

Ahi tuna sandwich ($18!) was cold and the bread spongy. The waiter reheated but it was still terrible. GF got the chicken, she ate only half. Large portions but subpar & overpriced. Salads were ok so they get 2 stars. Maybe we got em on a bad day ...<//Review>
