I've only gone to this gym a handful of times but so far so good! The membership set up was a little sketchy, but that could be because I'm used to going to bigger and corporately owned gyms. It was a little annoying to obtain my key but they really worked with me the best they could. The initial set up is also not done the way the agreement says it'll be done, but I'm assuming COVID has forced some changes to be made. I love that it's 24/7. It's the main reason I joined because it really works with my schedule. My only complaints so far is I think cleanings should be performed more often than they are currently. Not entirely because of the pandemic but because the bathroom (women's bathroom, in this case) has not been cleaned in a week and it's absolutely disgusting and no paper towels to dry your hands. I also wish there was a bit more floor space for floor exercises but I totally understand since the place is already pretty small as it is. I'd give this place 5 stars if it weren't for how disheveled and dirty it is. I wish there were half stars because I would technically give it a 4.5. The actual equipment needs to be bit tidied up as well. I do what I can on my part to keep it organized and clean. The actual equipment itself is pretty clean and everything I've used so far works!<//Text>

I am in the area working for the next few months and gotta say these guys roll out the red carpet. I started membership online but Keith dropped off my after hours key at my hotel before I checked in so I could workout in the morning.

Gym is clean and organized. Clean restrooms and awesome staff!<//review>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Text>I wouldn't say this is the best gym around, but it has what I need to get a good workout. It can get very crowded making it hard to get a workout in at times. Some of the equipment should have some maintenance done. And some of the people who go there should understand that others are also working out. Some like to sit on the equipment and not do anything. Weights are usually never put away. I give this place really a 3.5 but thats not an option.</Text>< pictures>

We were in town on a business trip staying at the local hotel across the street. The hotel gym was terrible. :( we cam across the street and the owner hooked us up big time with a 3 day pass! Coolest guys ever! If you are looking for a great gym for very cheap go here!</Review>

Signing up was probably the easiest thing ever. No hidden fees or long time commitment. Clean facility and they’re expanding as well in Tracy. Finally a real gym that’s actually 24 hours. Definitely would recommend signing up here.</text>

<Review>I’ve known about All City Fitness since the guy first opened his doors a couple of years ago.  I’d been going to the Fit Republic nearby for several months already.  Now, I’m gonna admit that I was a little harsh with my appraisal of his gym at first glance.  See, as an avid and happy member of Fit Republic, I didn’t really think much of this gym.

Fast forward to now, Fit Republic (as well a host of other gyms) all have fallen prey to the pandemic, having had to close their doors.  This guy, however, still strong and, get this, actually growing.  It takes serious amount of business savvy to not just survive a financial situation that forces other gyms out of business but see growth like All City has.
With Fit Republic gone, I had to find myself a new gym to work out in.  I found myself at All City and have been here for a week.  Here’s how that week went:

Signing up was really easy.  Just hit their website, selected a membership package, paid and got all the necessary paperwork in my email within minutes.  The next day, I took that paperwork to the gym and promptly received my key fob.

Sunday was Pull Day for me.  The cables might seem humble, but they hit in all the right spots.  The weight plate numbering system on this cable machine is a bit odd, going 1,2,3,4,ect instead of lbs or kgs.  So, it takes a little feeling around for what weight is right for your goals.

Monday was Cardio/Core.  This gym has an Assault Bike.  I’d often heard of these from the Crossfit community and have always wanted to try one out.  Few gyms have these, and I was excited to see one here.  They are NO JOKE!

Tuesday was Leg Day.  I had to adjust my leg program to accommodate the smaller size of this gym.  Walking lunges just aren’t feasible here.  So, you’ll have to work on regular lunges or split squats.  He has one squat rack here. At first glance, it looked like two, but it’s really just one and a pole to TRX gear.  It’s fine, I was able to get some squats in on this rack with little issue.  I appreciate how other member use the squat rack for squats and not for curls or other stuff they can do elsewhere.

Wednesday was Upper Body day, and I got a good feel for All City’s benches and dumbbells.  He’s got a good selection of dumbbells, going all the way to 100lbs.   The benches are decent, albeit showing some milage.

Friday was Leg Day again and this time I tried out the quasi-smith machine he has there.  It’s not a Smith Machine per se as, while it is on a rail, the bar can float freely to and fro, so there’s a stability element to be needed with this.  Plenty of plates to get some good numbers with on squats and deadlifts and I really do like the bumper plates he has.  The hex bar is also a welcome sight.

Saturday was Push Day.  He’s got this pec deck that is flat out amazing!  I’ve never had a stronger connection on a pec deck before this one.  I’ve had some truly great chest push days in my lifting lifetime, this will be counted as one of my best!

So, one week down and yeah, this gym can be a bit cramped and you’ll want to plan around the gear he has.  But, he’s growing, I’m told there’s some squat cages and a hack squat coming in.  Then, there’s the new location in the strip mall near MacArthur that’s gonna open up soon, which is very big and spacious.  All in all, this gym really is great and a very, very good value for what you pay a month for it.

I highly recommend.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< UserId.>

All City is a very well maintained, clean and friendly gym, with 24/7 access which makes it the greatest factor in deciding which type of gym to choose from! The staff is always helpful and quick to reply to any questions or concerns.
I’ve been a customer for about 3 months and have not had a problem, and it is usually well dispersed in the late afternoon so you get plenty of time to use weights and machines freely.< /Review>

Love this gym! The environment is positive and the owners are super friendly. It’s always clean! And everyone wipes down there machines before and after use (which I love). The simple fact that it’s the ONLY 24hr gym in Tracy, is convenient. The hours compliment my schedule. I highly recommend this gym to friends and family or anyone who is looking for a home gym because it definitely feels like it.<//review>

Loved my time here at All City Fitness. I especially appreciated how nice the owners were. They always greeted you when you came in and said goodbye when they left. Working out at the gym for the first time I was originally nervous, but All City Fitness was a perfect environment for me. I would definitely recommend this gym to anyone who was looking for a new place to workout!</text>

Regarding the Gym, the equipments are great and in great shape too. I visit in the mornings and its pretty free at that time. The restrooms are clean and well maintained. Towels are provided. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great gym within the budget.< /review><Name>Rishabh Srivastava</Name>< Date>

All City Fitness is awesome! Everyone here is super friendly, the equipment is always clean, and it's open 24/7! Being someone who's not always comfortable with working out in public, I found the environment at the gym to be really welcoming and nonjudgemental. It's definitely worth getting a monthly membership here!<//review>

All City fitness is an absolute gem!! It’s clean and quite , with a great vibe and atmosphere. The fact that’s it’s open 24/7 just puts the icing on the cake. When you can combine affordability and dependability, that ultimately just translates into a high quality experience. Being a fitness enthusiast, I’ve had my fair share of gym memberships and experiences, but ACF has to be one of the better investments I’ve made! Highly recommended this gym! And major thanks to Rod and Keith for creating such an awesome establishment !< /Review>

This gym is a great 24 hidden gem! They just opened by the mall. The big gyms like Fit republic, Inshape, and planet fitness in Tracy are always too crowded, have young teens hogging machines, or are a social breeding ground for people. If you want to come into a welcoming atmospheric gym that gives you the tools you need to get a great 1 hour workout, this is the place. Great and friendly owners always make you feel welcomed! Highly recommend going here. No distractions, just a great place to put in the work.<//Review>

<Review>When I first moved to Tracy a few months ago, I was lost with figuring out where I can work out. After looking into gyms in the area, I noticed all closed really early and never fit in with my schedules and with my own time. And to add, they were all way over priced. That was until I came across all city fitness. They are a 24-Hour gym, not pricey at all and very close to where I work so I could go when I’m done with my shifts. The owners are very welcoming and make you feel very comfortable. Usual gyms usually make me feel really intimidated but I felt no judgement at all here. They give you your own pendant to open the door so you can come whenever you like even if it’s in the early hours of the morning. The gym has a lot of space to get in any workout you wanna do and has lots of great equipment. There’s also a stair master which is my personal favorite. The gym also includes private bathrooms and a clean filtered water machine to refill your water while your on that gym grind. If it wasn’t for me moving out of Tracy back to the bay, I would definitely still be attending all city fitness.</Review><UserId.>112012289233256223322< /UserId.></record>

The gym is a little smaller than your normal typical 24 hour fitness but the good thing about it it makes you focus and not waste time to look for the equipment. They have all the equipment you need. Also, the place is clean and neat. Especially the bathrooms they are clean. Most gyms dont even clean their bathrooms constantly. If you are that person wants to change your lifestyle and focus, come to all city fitness. This gym is less distraction less people to interact and all you can think of is change and be motivated. Also, Rod and his colleague are congenial and very welcoming.excellent personal trainer and they really focus on you and make sure you dont cheat counting your reps and making sure you will achieve your fitness goals.

All it takes to change is one small step.< /Review>

This gym has been great since day one of my signing. Owners Rod and Keith are great! These two guys are two of the most awesome gym owners I’ve met during my experience of being in different gyms! Nothing but positivity with these two, they are like your pre-work out, get you going and always offering their help to help you achieve your goals. I would definitely recommend this gym!</Text>

As a personal trainer at the facility and someone who has worked out and worked at big box facilities for 3 years I am in love with what All City has to offer! No machine tag at this gym as it allows for you to get in and out and support a small business at the same time!

The equipment and machines selection is also top notch and allows for you to save time at the gym by being able to execute your workouts in record time!

Would also recommend the facility to independent trainers who are looking at a viable option with respect to their clients goals!<//Review>

So this gym has it all! Never let the size fool you! This gym has all the equipment you could possibly need for a full body workout including cardio. The folks that come hear are really laid back. The owners are really helpful and create an atmosphere of equality. When I'm in Tracy, this is my place to go. Visit them and see what I mean.</Review>

Just started working out here about 2 weeks ago, so far this is the easiest and most stress free gym to get a good work out in that I've been to. Since it's open 24/7 there really isn't many people there when you go. I've seen Max like 4/5 people here when I am. That means little to no wait for a machine, it's awesome. Really recommend this gym for anyone just starting out, or any veterans in the gym game who are tired of a super crowded gym. 5/5< /Review>

My husband and I really loves All City Fitness. We moved from Hawaii & we needed a gym. We're SO happy & blessed we found these guys. They became part of our ohana. It's convenient, the guys are informative, SUPER clean & people there are "GREAT" to work out with!!! They deserve more than five stars. Mahalo for such a "GREAT" experience!!! :)<//Text>

<Text>I work in the area and frequently walk near this place  during my lunch breaks. I love the 24 hour access and the small close knit vibe. The owner(s) greet me by name every time I go in and I'm not intimidated to ask questions  when it comes to my lack of knowledge about certain exercises. Highly recommend this place.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<response>None</response><text>Just started my membership along with my significant other, and what we like about All City Fitness is the convenience (open 24 hours) where you can really go at your own schedule, and I think because of that, the gym is isn’t packed and you’re not waiting for a machine to use. The staff are friendly and helpful, the facility is clean and well maintained, and those factors tie in to making the gym an enjoyable place to work out in< /text>< pics>

I am able to use free weights, do floor workouts, run the tread and use equipment  without having to wait like the other gyms in town. Owners are super friendly and accommodating, they offer personal training as well. Parking is never an issue and location is easy accessible. They offer towel service, chilled coconut carbon filtered water, plenty of TV’s and good music. Great vibes all around. Pretty soon they will offer plant based products to kickstart your new health journey! What more can you ask for. The great thing about this gym is that it’s 24 HOURS! You are given a key fob and have access at all hours of the day. Super affordable. They will offer guest passes soon so you can bring a workout buddy. All City Fitness is a great gym, I recommend to all my friends, family and locals.</text>< Pics>

Awesome gym, clean environment, new equipment, friendly knowledgeable staff.

I have a hectic work schedule, that requires me to commute daily to the Bay Area.

Having access to this gym 24/7, allows me to train whenever I can.</text>

I don't here for all my pharmacy needs. There pharmacy is super helpful and are great with answering questions. There stuff in pharmacy as well are very helpful. Covid-19 procedure are taken very seriously here. At times they will shut down to clean the entire store so if you're coming out from a far place call ahead.<//Review>

Yesterday I went to pick up a prescription for my mom and the pharmacist Jonathan provided the worse Customer Service I have ever experienced.

When I pulled up to the window Jonathan didn’t even acknowledge me or say just a moment while he wiped  down the drawer, his area and equipment. He then walked away and after several minutes he comes back and says how can I help you. When I told him what I wanted and provided all of my mother’s information he walks away again. Several minutes later a female comes to the window and asks how can she could help me. When I told her she saw all of the information already on the computer. She comes back with my mom’s prescription right away. By this time my blood is boiling and I questioned her did Jonathan just go on break without telling me and she confirms that he did. I tell her how rude and  unprofessional he was by not telling me he was going on break and that someone will be right with me. She apologizes and says he’s new. Although I appreciated her apology there is no excuse for rudeness and being new should not give anyone a pass. If anything being new you should be following the manual for providing good customer service  by the book. Now I’m questioning is this the type of behavior they are teaching.<//review>

I waited for about 15 mins in line to get to the cashier, there were 4 workers 3 of then cashier but only one was on the register, the second lady "cashier" was taking pics of of customers waiting in line instead of helping on the other cashier register, when I finally made it to pay the cashier lady was having a bad day with a bad attitude to customers.< /review>

Every time i come to this store the staff is always so wonderful to me, so kind and helpful with any questions or things i need. They totally look out for their community. The manager Yolanda is always so nice and pleasant to deal with, she always so nice to my kids as well and trust me they are hard to handle especially in a store. Best rite-aid i have every visited by far!! The management and staff are up to par :) will always go here for my daily needs.<//Text>

<Review>I regret it to choose here as my pharmacy! They really do t care I was too sick nearly could stand in line and when get there she asked me to wait for 1 hour just to put 6 ready antibiotics on a pocket even when I explained I can’t wait I need to start taking them she didn’t try to help. I walked out without my antibiotics until my husband got them at night for me!
Not helpful not caring not nice!<//Review>< pics>

<Review>Don’t count on this rite aide to call you to notify you when your prescription is ready. They take no responsibility or action to help the customer to let them know your stuff was refilled. They just continually say their system is down and there’s nothing they can do about it. So if your life depends on having a prescription filled at an accurate time do not count on them to let you know.

There system is always down.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< GmapID>

Stopped by on 9/13 around 9:30 to get one thing. The two woman in the front were incredibly rude. Not only did they give me attitude the cashier a middle aged hispanic lady rolled her eyes at me when she gave me the receipt. After both of them where laughing at something over the radio that someone was saying to them. Please train your team in customer service or hire some qualified management.<//review>

Dear Riteaid pharmacy,
Can you PLEASE post the correct hours for drive thru? The hours are not posted on the window of the drive thru and so I called and asked specifically what time the drive thru closes.  I was told 10pm over the phone, show up at 8 and they're closed.  I couldn't come into the store because I had my dog with me.
Other than that,  I've had a good experience with this store.
Thankyou.<//text>

Good experience, well stocked with Dayquil and cough drops and Listerine. It was  open early at 7 a.m. on Saturday.  Had a nice chat with the man at the counter. The man suggested I get a bag, which I'm glad he reminded me. He asked me if I had a rite-aid card and I used my phone number and got a 4 dollar discount.<//Review>

Horrible.  Workers do not know what the other is doing.  One says one thing and vice versa.  My local rite told me there would NOT be a problem transferring.  The other said they couldn't.  I've transferred rite aids before with no issue. Now I have to go out of my way for me to get my MAJOR SEIZURE meds    They also told me I would actually have to call my Dr to switch to their rite aid.    Foothill rite aid is straight BS . DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!< /Text>

Near halfway house, so always weirdos hanging out out front. Apparently, the pharmacy phones don't work because they do call you when your prescriptionnia ready nor pick up their phone when you call. No pharmacist on duty when I dropped off my script, just 5 girls not answering the phones talking about some drama.<//Review>

I went on Saturday  to pick up my child's prescription.  I had gone online for the pharmacy hours which said they were open Saturday  from 7am to 10 pm. I got there at 7 pm and the drive thru was closed with a hand written note saying the drive thru hours were different.  So, I got down and went in. It was closed inside too. I'm glad that my son still has enough pills to hold him over for a couple days. I was disappointed  that their hours posted online do not reflect their true hours.< /Review>

<rating>1< /rating><text>Horrible service in the pharmacy. Dropping off my prescription didn't take any time at all. I came back and waited for 45 min in line to find out that they had my prescription ready, but if I wanted to use my insurance they were going to have me wait an additional 20 min to  recount the pills. And not to mention I provided my insurance when I dropped the prescriptions off. Not that CVS is any better. Are there any good pharmacies in Sylmar I think not.< /text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

<text>Pharmacy is the WORST!!! They say ur dr denied ur refill then I called the dr office and they say that they never got a request for refill. So many times this has happened . The final straw was the pharmacist had me on hold and I was in the drive thu and was watching him and he was just ignoring my call.  He didn't know I was waiting in line watching him. The worst pharmacy ever! !< /text><Date>1504177829333< /Date>< pictures>

Great location, pharmacy is okay and register lines are iffy. So many people complaining about this rite aid, what are the alternatives? I never rate a place based on the best places in the world, I base it off the area and the competition. CVS in san fernando is beyond horrible and the other big name pharmacies are worse. I've experienced the problems these people complain about, and yet I still give 4*. I was born and raised by empire state building in NYC. Theres a CVS 1 block from there on fifth avenue, very high traffic averaging 40 people in a 1500 sq ft store...and they have usually 1 to 2 cashiers with lines in excess of 15 all day, the pharmacy is usually gated closed and you have to ring a bell to get someone to open it. Point being, lower your standards, its Rite Aid, not a private independent pharmacy.

Parking lot is great, for those complaining about pharmacy hours, go to their direct location website and check PHARMACY HOURS which is different than store hours.<//Review>

The pharmacy is absolutely horrible.  They are not helpful at all.  I called and they left me on hold for 26 minutes without coming back once in that time.  I hung up and called back and they picked up, no greeting, and put me on hold again.  Every pharmacy technician I've spoken to in the last 2 years has been rude and unhelpful.  I would not recommend filling prescriptions at this location.<//text>

If you call to check on the status they don't know about it.

(Translated by Google) It is a good place where you can find a little of everything, but they exaggerate in some prices. They also made me come to the pharmacy twice because my son's medicine was not ready, the second time it was ready but they made me wait 15 more minutes without any reason when the medicine was already there

Es un buen lugar donde puedes encontrar un poco de todo, pero exageran en algunos precios. Además me hicieron venir 2 veces a la farmacia porque el medicamento de mi hijo no estaba listo, la segunda vez ya estaba listo pero me hicieron esperar 15 minutos más sin algún motivo alguno cuando ya estaba ahí el medicamento< /text>

I love this place I get up early on Friday to go there the prices are so good you can't beat nowhere. the volunteers helpful I never ran across a rude one the only person you have a problem with is the manager I can't remember her name at this time she want to overcharge on everything but I guess you've been there all along time. I have nothing bad to say about it except for what I said this manager try to go up on stuff especially if it's not marked. And I do recommend it to other people. I don't know how they get their volunteers I I only see Hispanics occasion volunteers< /text>

Love their sales they don't try to highway rob you the prices are outstanding you can't beat it no where they have all donations and they don't try to rip you off like Goodwill and salvation army and other thrift that get the stuff give me to them. They only open on Fridays 8 to 10 and Saturday 8 to 10 and it's well worth every penny of it. Located in highland California.</review>

We LOVE this place!!! They have so many various things there including clothes, blankets, bedding, furniture, toys, books, dishes, CDs, sewing patterns, and even other random things people have donated like weights, tools, etc. Open Saturdays 8am-12pm and yes they take donations. Their earnings help keep this place open and mainly help them serve the homeless and less fortunate. They normally don't sell their bigger blankets. They save them to give out free to those in need. Ruby, the woman I charge, is awesome!! Very organized place too. They made it even MORE organized lately. Beautiful!< /Review>

This place offers assistance to low income families that are in need of food,  clothing and other health items like shampoo and soap, they also work with many churches to help them gain access to acquire food for their parishioners. You do however have to fill out an application and wait for it to be approved, at which time you will then be able to call and be put on a list for a food box that they will also deliver if you have no transportation or are handicapped and cannot pick it up yourself.< /review>

I came too know the mission through John and Barbara some years ago. Through that outreach the Word of Life ministries helped thousands of people each week. The mission is still blessing many every day.</Review>

<Review>I am devastated. Everything I asked them not to do they did. EVERYTHING. My always happy little boy feels so exposed and naked he has been hiding. He acts like I had him punished. I asked to keep his face Teddy bear. I gave.specific instructions. The woman who groomed him left before I got my dog. She ran right by me and didn't say a word.  In fact I was there before the three people ahead of me and got my dog last. No comments, no questions. $90.00. I'm never going back.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Text>First time bringing my dog here for pet boarding. Cathy and Marie are awesome and took care of him very well. My wife and I are extremely happy with them and now we can have peace of mind every time we travel and can't take Chewby with us.

The first time i took my dog anywhere to stay without me i took him here. The staff were super friendly and accomodating. Not overly exspensive which is nice and my dog also got a bath there and they go on 2 walks a day. Cathy and Jennifer are the sweetest.</Text>

<review>I have a geriatric chow and I explicitly explained his medical conditions over the phone and they said "No, problem." The day of our trip we took Ollie to their facility and my baby has respiratory issues, it is age nothing contagious. Well we barely entered the lobby and Large Marge comes out and starts bellowing out that there is something wrong with Ollie.  So I am calmly trying to explain Ollie's condition but Marge was not listening at all. So my husband took Ollie outside because she was scaring him with her loud voice.  Ollie may be old but he isn't deaf and neither are my husband and I.  So after getting no where with this lady she tells us that Ollie has to see their vet...ok. Well she takes Ollie from us and takes him to see the vet. Since we weren't allowed to go with Ollie, which is odd... She comes back and tells us and everyone else within ear shot that Ollie has laryngeal paralysis. I am a nurse and I tried explaining Ollie's condition to her but this woman loves the sound of her booming voice. After speaking with my husband we decided to board Ollie at another facility and we had zero problems at the other hotel and I am glad that we found out how incompetent this place is....So hell no would I recommend this place!!!!<//review><name>THE Queen</name><Date>1592253529961< /Date><UserId.>108637815231152011879</UserId.>< Resp>

I worked there for 3 weeks. They have absolutely no respect for their staff and customers, constantly got yelled at, they don't put any safety hazards on the cages for aggressive dogs, Managment lacks on punctuality and they refuse to provide any PPE for their employees.  There was gloves only in 1 size, no hand soap, and no hand sanitizer.  I also got attacked by one of the dogs there and supposedly they forgot she didn't like men even though it's been in her records for 3 years and didn't even mention anything.  So if your looking for a job don't do it.< /text>

This is the only place to go for professional grooming, great staff, clean facility, competitive pricing, lots of parking, and groomers that understand there is more too just grooming a pet. When you pet looks good its makes you feel good.< /review>

<text>Great place, staff really cares for your pet, I brought my Scottish terrier in for grooming, the girl that handled my dog took the time to get to know our pet, very knowledgeable staff, pricing right on point. Lots of parking, fast and courteous staff and large green belt for walking your dog, cat, etc. Highly recommend this business.</text><Response>None< /Response>< Date>

<Review>We booked this place for 3 nights for our two dogs plus grooming. One of our dogs is a small terrier mix with high anxiety levels so i was not surprised when they called on the 3rd day saying she was vomiting and needed to be picked up asap. I appreciated them calling so I could end my trip a little early instead of leaving her miserable. The grooming on both dogs was great, and it was very convenient instead of taking time for a groomer. They only cost a bit more than normal groomers and warned they might need to add a fee for the poodle-terrier mix because of matting (which he was) but they didn't. The fee was only $10 anyway.
I would use this hotel again for my dogs if the little one didn't have anxiety problems.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

I've been going to Dr. Grant's since 1986. I use their pet clinic (Animal Discount Clinic) for shots and neutering/spaying. I use their Animal Friends Pet Hotel for grooming and housing, and when stuff gets serious, I go to the Community Veterinary Hospital. What I REALLY LIKE is they are all right there, next door to each other! And(!!!) they are open 7 days! Dr. Grant is well known and police/sheriffs go to him when an animal officer is injured. Need I say more?

Thank you Dr. Grant (et al) for taking such good care of my critters!!! (Dogs, cats, birds, and guinea pigs) 🐶🐺🐹🐦💜< /text>

<Text>I have to say that the food is really good. I haven't had anything that I haven't liked. Tacos and burritos are super good and the burrito are really big. They make the food right there but it does take a little long to get the food. We waited about 20 min for the food but it was fresh.< /Text>< Pictures>

Let alone that but the rice beans and asada had no taste.. don’t let me get started on the salsa, it tasted so stale and was not it anymore. Will definitely be the last time I go.</text>< pictures>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) The only Red lunch box that is parked on Grand Street and Grovemont across from Cangrejo Nice # 3 in Santa Ana,
I love how they brown the meat as much as the asada or chicken tacos They have a very different seasoning, very delicious I have been to many lunch boxes but I always return here
They also have horchata and flan for dessert

(Original)
La única lonchera Roja que está parqueada sobre la calle Grand y Grovemont enfrente del Cangrejo Nice #3 en Santa ana,
Me encanta como doran la carne tanto como los tacos de asada o de pollo Tienen una sazon muy diferente muy delicioso He ido muchas loncheras pero siempre regreso aquí
También tienen horchata y flan para su postre<//Review>

I loved this place because it was almost deserted! I actually was able to browse without being over-run by people and carts! It probably wasn't so great for K-mart, business was terrible for them. They did use the time wisely, all the shelves were fully stocked and the cashiers were glad to see people I imagine, because they were super friendly!< /Text>

Rarely do they have prices on items. Good luck finding help. They have fallen far from their glory days. Definitely a last resort for shopping. Ok selection on shoes. Clothes, not so much. Prepare to wait forever in line due to price checks.</Review>

< Review>
Love Kmart, it was sad to have seen this store closed. But considering the area. It was in a poor area. There was more theft then sales. So it seemed. But besides that, the employees were always friendly and ready to answer all your questions and concerns. I do hope they get back into Bakersfield one day. (probably not) but can wish.. :)</Review>

K-mart takes me back to my childhood... I'm glad some stores are still around. Good pricing but how do they compete with Walmart? Location I guess...<//text>

Prices on some things are cheaper but the service isn't very good and the store/environment itself is usually really dirty. I only shop here maybe once a year for the few cheaper items but other than that, Walmart is a lot cheaper and the one on gosford is usually much cleaner and has better service.</Review>

<Review>The lighting is kind of dark for a large store which makes you feel weird while shopping. The lines are usually ling and the staff is not always helpful.< /Review>< gmap_id>

<review>Bad customer service .. I'd rather shop elsewhere! I really wish these little ladies they hire would save their annoying & inappropriate conversation to themselves or wait for their lunch time or break to discuss their sleeping around random guys at the nightclubs .... I don't need to hear that while I'm there I don't care about their sexual lifestyle or preference Seriously ?

< review>
So many empty shelfs left in the open, employees are lazy or rude, they look so bored they give of a bad vibe, I saw an expired  milk in the Milk product and when I told a employee, he wasn't shocked or anything, acted like it happens before, this place really ran it's corse 5 years ago, this place is the last place I want to go for items<//review>

Somehow ended up the east end of LA and bumped into this place. I ordered in Spanish, ate some amazing Mexican food, and had a great conversation with the staff. If you're in the area, pop on by for some authentic Mexican. I know there are a lot of places in East LA, but this one was just fun to pop into and have an amazing bite! I asked for more spice...como lo hace me mama!<//Text>

Great food, and even better people serving it. I've occasionally stoped by for a bite to eat over the last few years since I live in the area. Always a great experience and always leave with a full stomach and a smile on my face.</text>

Great customer service and the owner does all the cooking. Oh did I forget breakfast is good here too. Give a try..< /Text>< rating>

Delicious home style food... if ya be married to a latina. Excellent pancakes & very decently priced menu of other dishes.. thumb up!!!  Only 4 stars out of 5 since it's been years since visted last. Will give a higher once I revisit this charmingly delicious restaurant.   😊</text>

Enchiladas and Chille rellenos are the best ! And to top it all off they give you a little bit of soup before your order ! Very authentic just like grandma house</Review>

Ed and David did great, I’m a first time buyer so they were super helpful. I got recommended by my friend, didn’t think I’d leave the lot with a new mustang but hey here we are. Definitely recommend, I had a great time, super funny and helpful. If your thinking of buying a car this is the place to be.<//Review>

Just got the best deal from Alberto and Ed. Came for a $5999 car, left with a $5200 car. As well as deduction on a fee that was not needed. They also got my monthly payment to a low which is great!! Definitely will be back for another some day.< /Review>

I would not recommend this place to anyone I bought a car from this place and it burned oil in two weeks after buying the car I did a oil change two months after the oil change the motor went out because it did not have oil. A couple other things I suggest do not give them the five star rating they ask for during the paperwork process and get a quote on the vehicle before they run your credit check because they check to see how much you qualify for than over price the car your interested. Good luck.</Review>

<user>113994588660097562154< /user><Review>This place and the car dealer are a blessing... He’s an honest man...hard to find! After searching 3 other cars places that all tried to sell problem cars we found this car sale place and we found a blessing !!
The cars are awesome !! They are great running cars!! For great prices .. unbelievable!!
He also gave of piece of mind with the 2 yr warranty and he even offered to help us after if any problems were to arise for great deals!!
I wouldn’t buy a car from any place else!! I will refer and highly recommend to buy from this place !!
The man that helped was a veteran too which is a plus in my book and explained the honesty!!
For those that need a place that will work with you for any reason this is the place too go!!!
Remember don’t bite the hand that’s helps you!!
He’s a good person and a good (great!!) dealership!!
100% 100 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️+ in mine and my family’s book!!!<//Review>< GmapID>

No run arounds or hidden details, very good quality inventory. I didn’t feel rushed into buying, they heard all my needs and concerns. As well as answered all my questions. They went above and beyond to make sure I was happy, offering more options than expected as a first time buyer. The process was a breeze and I got a super sweet deal within my budget. I’m now driving off in a Chevy Malibu!!! Thank you Empire....highly recommended and 10 stars if I could!!!</text>< user_id>

Israel and Uncle Ed helped me find a really good Nissan Altima 08 and I’m so happy that they helped me. They worked with my income and me having no credit. This is my second car and I’m glad that it is not salvage. They are excellent at what they do!</review>

DO NOT BUY A CAR HERE! We purchased a 2011 BMW 535i that was previously being driven by the owner and his wife. Car came with
NO HEATER, NO A/C, DIRTY AND LOW ON OIL and a FAULTY AFTERMARKET FUEL PUMP THE CONNECTORS DIDNT MATCH EITHER SO THEY SPLICED AND USED ELECTRICAL TAPE.
The car is currently at BMW $2,300 for a new A/C $1700 for new fuel pump and connector. BMW stayed they would’ve replaced fuel pump under recall for free. Except Empire Auto Sales changed it with the aftermarket so now BMW won’t cover it.
My husband replaced the heater himself and that was around $400.
EMPIRE AUTO SALES FORGOT TO SMOG OUR CAR THAT THEY CHARGED US FOR. SO WR HAD TO TAKE IT IN ON OUR TIME.< /review>

The guys are really great while looking and buying. Were even honest about pay it off fast to save money because my interest was high because of my credit. I knew and had a plan set up already but I'm thankful they did't hide anything that I was looking at after I walked out the door. I would definitely buy there again!</text>

This place is awesome. Big Ed is the man. My dad bought a car here a couple years ago and the Guys at Empire Auto Sales were more than just accommodating they went over and above all expectations. Kind, courteous, and a pleasure doing business with. So much so that my wife and I are going to buy another car there right now. I would recommend Empire Auto Sales to everyone. Come see Big Ed at Empire, he'll hook you up.<//text>

The car I purchased was a complete lemon. I tried to trade it in at a REAL dealership and found out there has been an extensive amount of repairs made to the car. This car can very well be a salvage.  These people at Empire never told us a word about it. Now I'm stuck paying for a car that I can't get rid of and need to put in thousands of dollars to fix. These people are a rip off all they want is money and don't care who they take it from.< /text>

I couldn't be any happier then driving off in that BMW we're talkin about love 60 plus thousand dollar card for an awesome price thank you Ed</text></record>

<text>Love love love love all the staff here at Empire Auto Sales. I just bought my grandma a 2006 Pontiac yesterday and sent my mother today to get a 2005 highlander and ED worked with them both and approved them. My grandmother is happy and so is my mother I will be in next month in the beginning of the month to get me a new car as well. I’m going to continue to send people to this car lot and recommend people to this lot. I love how professional this staff is and how they work with EVERYBODY!! I’m a very satisfied customer and seeing my grandmother and mama happy is all that matters and y’all did just that! THANK YOU!!!! Business will continue to come through my family and I <3 #HappyCustomer<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x153268027ef3466b:0x15a7449369acb416<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Ed was very polite and personable.  He was very informative and helpful.  He was very patient while i got the information needed for my loan.  He understood my position and helped me get a loan when i thought it would be impossible.  He helped me find a beautiful car that looked like no one had ever sat in the car. The interior is just beautiful with not one blemish.  I would recommend anyone who thinks they cant get a loan for a car to go see Ed.  If he could help me he can help anyone.  Thank you Ed and Empire Auto Sales.  You saved my job and my family.  Cheri<//review><Rating>5<//Rating>< Date>

< Review>
I recently purchased a car from here.I have read all the reviews on here and I agre and disagree with a lot.My experience was good with these guys. My wife and I decided we needed a run around town car,so we search used car lots. The cleanliness and cosmetic value of their cars was above standard. Our salesman was your typical used car salesman,but also knowledgeable and helpful, he worked hard to find us a car that met our needs,plus fit in our budget. Then we test drove 4 cars, I let them know I lived close and wanted to check car at home and show me kids. They said no problem, when we were signing paperwork,we brought up about two problem with car we seen and they covered cost to have taken care of. I fully recommend this lot, they go above and beyond to meet your needs. So as for reviews a used car is not new, there will always be unforeseen problems. I found some and Empire honored their promise. Thank You< /Review>

<review>After driving around looking for a good affordable deal on a new car, we finally found a place! I recommend everyone to come here, the staff is great, laid back and makes sure you are getting the better end of the deal . I don't have the slightest complaint about this place, they financed me explained to me exactly how my contract works, they gave me an affordable payment of my liking and a 2011 car! It's absolutely a 5 star rating and I recommend you go here! Other places advertised one thing and then I get there and they changed their terms. Not the case with empire! They are true to their word and really help you get a great deal!<//review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x153268027ef3466b:0x15a7449369acb416</gmapID></record>

Drove around town and found that they had the best prices around! Wide selection of nice cars to choose from. Customer service was great. They went above and beyond to make my purchase as easy and pleasant as possible.  They will be my go-to car lot for future purchases!!</Review>

Easy, no pressure. Come correct and they'll take care of you. Very professional and friendly. We went to other dealerships in town and were not impressed by the customer service. As a manager of a business that has been around since 1994, I know customer service is important. These guys were top notch.<//review>

Felt at home when shopping for a car at this dealership. Lalo is the man to go to if you need any help, and the manager Big Ed broke everything down for me making it a pleasant place to shop. Affordable cars too. Thanks guys!</Text>

Got my first car today!! Took me less than 20 to check it a few cars and decide on one officially. Lalo spotted me in the lot as soon as I got on the property. Told me straight facts about the gas prices and things I can expect for long term. Wayyyy easier than other car places!<//text>

When looking for a new car you want to find good quality people. After having a horrible experience from Paul Blanco I came here and received over the top customer service from ED he made my car purchase flawless and easy. Stress free... best service ever< /text>

Horrible! Just beacuase it's tax time doesn't mean you can jack the price of a USED car up to the amount of what a new car would be! Once the guy heard what we had to offer down he pretty much was done with us! Since when is $2,000 not enough to put down on a used car? I bought my first car from here when they were still in empire and the actual owners were the ones selling the cars and they were honest and willing to work with us. That car lasted us a good 5 years so we thought going back, especially since they had expanded, would. W worth our while. Boy were we wrong! Money hungry company that's for sure! Your better off going and getting a new car off the lot with the prices they offer here</review>

<Review>I've had my car for just about 2 years and in those 2 years I've replaced an alternator the lights in my gauge cluster are all out have to replace the whole thing. My ac compressor is failing the biggest thing that pisses me off is that the rear ac in my car never worked and I have kids but that's what I get for buying during winter who checks the ac when it's cold out. Buy from them if their your last option. Lesson learned.<//Review></record>

And the only place this cars been driving up and down to has been Europa Motors! I have had problems since day 1 from headlights not working, tires needing replacements all four, starter, A/C, Brakes replacement etc etc yes now the Radiator to the coolant reservoir has broken, causing violent leak all these problems are just some of them which Inpaid for out of my pocket but guess what, it is time for me to expose your lies and review to the Chamber of Commerce where I gladly been a member of. So please contact me as soon as you can because I’m tired of paying a car payment and car insurance that I can’t even drive in! I will also show receipts more then $2,500 and more not including the work and transportation to the mechanic. Man, it hasn’t even been a year and all these problems WOW!!! Oh and please stop telling the buyers of your cars to take a photo next to thier car and write a great review online.</Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

RAZA NO COMPRE AQUI
They really did my mom shady
Really trying to intimidate an older lady
Trying to cheat her of her money
My mother had put down a deposit for a car
And when she decided that that was not the way she wanted to go and tried gettin it back they wouldnt give it back
On the receipt it never said non refundable
How you going to try and cheat a woman out of her hard earned cash
Real men they are
When my cousin tried goin with her
Ed thinking hes a big scary guy tried to intimidate my cousin haha wow like really how are these guys in business
Crazy how these “men” did a single mother dirty<//Review>

<review>Really, I drove by their lot and was questionable. Then I saw MY TRUCK  I've been waiting for. I went in and talked with Ed. Unbelievable. My credit was poor. But I have been at my job a long time, and my residence... I didn't have enough for a down payment, but Ed found a way to help me out. Then!!!! I didn't go back there for almost a month when Ed was finally there. I walked in and he said how are you Mr (my last name). The thing is, my last name is so rare and hard to pronounce. Only my family has my last name in the states, and we are few. After almost a month, Ed knew who I was and remembered my last name.! That's insane! I was in retail many years, and I've never come across a sales person like Ed. I don't know how he does it, but if your reading this and you need a car, I'd give him a call. When in need, I'LL BE BACK.....</review><rating>5</rating>< name>

<review>I love this place. The staff are so cool and good at what they do. They are well trained and very clean. I am more happy now with the pay increase and bonuses. It is always refreshing to be greeted by smiling faces every time. My mom needs plasma to walk so this place is a blessing in more ways than one$.< /review>< user>

<review>Hey there folks how y’all doing? Hope you’re all having a great day. If you’re looking to becoming a plasma donor and making some extra money come on down to Santa Fe Springs Octapharma Plasma Donation Center. They’ll take good care of you, they got the best cool staff you can meet. They’re polite outgoing great positive attitude!! More places should hire people like them but anyways I hope this makes it clear if you looking to donate and make some extra cash on the side come through to Octapharma check them out. You’ll have a good first time experience and walk out with some money $$ in your pocket.<//review>< UserId.>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Super easy. If your new donor please expectancy of at least 4-5 hour process altogether, depending on what day. Better to call ahead too to see if their accepting new donors as well. So that way its better to know, than waste gas or unnecessary hours on the bus. It's a very hygienic place. Staff are really sweet and handle everything with care. Seats are comfortable. Overall great experience.</Text>< pictures>

<resp>{'time': 1533156160425, 'text': 'Hi Lea Michelle, You are correct, a first-time donation can take longer because of the initial donor suitability screening – including your medical history and an extensive health questionnaire. Return visits should take significantly less time, since they require a shorter health screening to ensure you’re in good health before you begin donating. We appreciate your life-saving plasma donations and hope to see you back in center again soon!'}< /resp><GmapID>0x80c2d25e064bb17b:0x749673eb31665225< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Been a donor for almost 2 years now. Every person on the staff here at Santa fe springs are always courteous, considerate and professional. I have never experienced any rudeness, arrogance or lack of empathy from any of the personalities here, and this is the only location I have donate at. Consistency is very important in life, and Consistency of Character is a quality which I take pleasure in whenever I encounter it, wherever I am. I have nothing bad to say about any of the staff, and I have found the routine here to be very efficient.

I have but one thing to mention which is the only thing that ever frustrates me from time to time.
Some times when there is a delay in the samples that are taken from each donation for screening, I find it a bit inconsiderate to me and my time that no one alerts me that there is a problem, like that or any other problem that might cause me to not be able to donate when I come in. I take public transportation to this office and when I go through everything I have to in order to make it here, I find it quite irritating to learn that there is an issue on your end which effects me on my end.
I dont like wasting my time, and I understand that things happen. But that is no excuse for inconsideration. I feel that a courtesy call should be made to those who might be effected by these kinds of hold ups. Waiting to tell us once we're already here and then turning us away is unacceptable. A simple call would save us a whole lot of time and travel money and frustration.

Aside from that, bravo.

Thank you for your time.

<Review>I am a traveling donor with my Twin, we've donated all across the country (Orlando & Jacksonville Florida,  Lynchburg Virginia, Terre Haute & Indianapolis Indiana) before reaching this one and I was WOWed! I loved being asked which (blood pressure) cuff worked best with me because 98% of the time, it's the regular blue one though my arm looks like it might need the bigger red/maroon one. I also loved how aware the staff was of keeping my Twin and I together in timing, even though I was delayed with a manual retake (because the red/maroon cuff doesn't always hear me.)

Thanks also for the staff's seemingly reliable routine of telling donors how much they earned and when they could next return. It was an exceptionally nice experience for us travelers!<//Review><Name>Remmy Ar'emen<//Name><GmapID>0x80c2d25e064bb17b:0x749673eb31665225<//GmapID>< Pictures>

<Text>I have had a tremendous experience with OctaPharma Plasma Santa Fe Springs. Each team member has made me feel like I’m at home and have taken care of each and every one of my needs while being there. All of the the team members staff are very kind, generous, and outstanding especially the employee named Mrs. Rita. I highly recommend that people go to Octapharma plasma Center in Santa Fe Springs on telegraph Road. The service is tremendous and outstanding.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Pretty simple just get ready for a long wait to be safe. Typically like 3-4 hours if your going in the afternoon. It would have been 5 if one of the ladies hadn't missed my vain and had my arm swell up about an inch high and 2 inches wide then Not be able to use my left arm at work for about 4 weeks. I could lift like 5 pounds after 1 week, but anything more would cause a shooting pain and I would drop my arm.<//review>

<review>Honestly the only reason why I'm giving this place 2 stars is not even because of the location because if it's due to location, I'd give it 5 stars at least up to how far I got into the process, but rather because of the waste of time and gas I had to go through, all because I'm a female to Male transgender man, the nice Nurse was actually really good at explaining the reason as to WHY I couldn't donate which I totally understand by the way; HOWEVER I feel that, just how she was able to  explain it to me so clearly and transparent, it should be something that is actually posted ON THEIR WEBSITE! Who knows how many people have been turned away for being transgender me, who have wasted their time and gas to get to one of their offices when it is something that has not only a simple and clear answer BUT also nothing that is in any way shape or form insulting or even discriminatory. So yeah, I'm sure I'll be contacting my lawyer because I feel like this is information that could have been previously given to me instead of having to be left stranded because I had no idea that as a transman I cannot donate plasma.<//review><rate>2<//rate>< Name>

I donated once and not again.  I realized how overly simple the entire donating eligibility process was. You are not drug tested, you are not providing a urine sample. You are providing a small blood sample for iron, protein, hydration eligibility etc. but not testing major disqualifications like HIV. Also, It isn’t disclosed how they clean their equipment. Be careful:
1.) They take out your blood.
2.) then, they put everything back into your body excluding your plasma.

So if HIV amongst other illnesses are not tested and use the same intricate systems on everyone to carry things in and out of your body along with still “donating” it without those testings. It’s something to think about. They don’t give you 75$ so they can just throw away spoiled “plasma” later. Reconsider your donation everyone for your safety and for the sake of this whole suspicious process.<//text>

For the most part, it's a decent place to donate at.  The staff is mostly friendly and will have a conversation with you as you donate as long as things are slow and there is no chaos.  However with that said (well typed) there are glitches and issues I have seen.
1. They would like you to donate on the same days over and over.  If you donate Tuesday and Thursday.  They want you to donate Tuesdays and Thursdays.  I get it, but let's see the problem with that, life happens and holidays happen.  So if you donate Tuesday and you have to work Thursday, or it's a holiday, your arm is sore and you just want to rest your arm one more  day or you have a family emergency and you can donate again on Friday.  You can't donate Tuesday you have to donate Wednesday.  When you try to explain the problem to an employee, they just hide behind rules and regulations and walk away without really explaining anything or asking if you would like to speak with a supervisor for a better explanation.
2.  I enjoy getting to know the employees and talking with them.  However, when you're hooked up to a machine and you hear an employee that is standing next to you start making comments "Men, who needs them.  We've got this".  Funny part is once my machine started glitching, she called a man to fix the problem. I think that the employees need to watch what is being said around your clients, you never know who is listening.
3. The kiosks have a few glitches and do not like to work properly.<//text>

<rate>5</rate><text>First time here the staff is friendly but I have to really give it to the nurse Joanne for putting me at ease being funny just an absolute pleasure to be attended by! Also candy, she was an ease since I somehow became a big baby when being poked in my finger lol totally calmed me with laughter I totally recommend this center for donations clean and very professional  atmosphere, first visit will be anywhere from 3-4 hours so be prepared, Joanne gave me some snacks to prevent hunger.. They check your protein, iron, test you by watching videos then a kiosk machine with a series of info then finally give you a quick run down in questions to make sure your paying attention, so pay attention! Oh lastly DO NOT WEAR a one piece, tight jeans rompers or anything that either connects or will prevent you to roll up to your knees! Once you get a physical test Joanne (the nurse😊) will check your body and needs access to knees and under your shirt, under some regulation you can't undress as you would do so normally in a doctor's office.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

< Review>
I had a wonderful experience there being a first time donor. They made sure I was aware of everything that happened they treated me with care every step through. Made sure I got all possible earnings. As a business some things are out of their hands as such as new donors wanting to come in at 12:00 and they close at 3:00 ; or not having the proper paper work or other circumstances that could prevent you from being a donor but I will say they do give the same amount of effort to everyone.<//Review>

Worst octapharma donation center ever... they dont pay as much as they're supposed to, and they take forever to attend you. They have no sense of urgency they work so slow last time I'm ever comming here I'd rather make the extra miles to the office in Anaheim that one your in and out as quick as an hour max!<//text>

I went 7/19/2019 around 9 am they were short staff and a lot of people waiting. It was my turn to get my iron checked and the lady nurse I didn't get her name but she was very rude, she was very rough with me. People before me were turned down to donate. I don't know why but it seems like she wasn't having a good morning. My 7th time donating and will  not return. VERY MEAN STAFF, VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!! PLEASE CHANGE BLUE GLOVES WITH EVERY DONOR I SEEN BLOOD ON THEM MULTIPLE TIMES!!! VERY NASTY< /Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>Too many chiefs not enough Indians. The satff is great but management is horrible.  There is about 6 upper management standing together b.s ing while the lobby is packed with people. The employees that do work have a great attitude and they put in work but if management would pull their heads out of their ( you know what im saying) this place would run 100% better. I would attach a picture of proof as i just got a snap shot of management discussing a cup of coffee  but lets hope they read this and something positive happends. But then again who am I  kidding if they wont pay attention to real life donors what do you think about them paying attention to a  review ! Makes me sick! Step your game up management.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<rate>3<//rate><Review>I've been here several times and it's the only plasma place I've donated at. I don't mind the long wait times as there's tvs and it's fairly comfortable and quiet inside. However the people who are trained flabotomists have a very difficult time placing the needle in the first time correctly or place it in too deep and touch muscle. I've bruised 3 times on the surface of my skin and had internal bruising where the needle poked too deep, so if you have a problem with big needles just be weary. The flobotomists say they could readjust the needle but I never do because I think they will mess it up a second time and bruise me more. Also advise checking your account balance immediately after donating so that way you don't go to withdrawal money and end up negative, that's also happened to me twice.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80c2d25e064bb17b:0x749673eb31665225< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Beware: do not come here. I saw several new donors that walked in after 1pm who got asked to come back another day! Also, if your documents (i.d., social security card, etc.), don't exactly match your name, they will deny you. I came here yesterday as a first time donor and it took well over 6 hours to get screened! All that just to get told that I needed to return with a doctor's note. Worse thing is that I was not compensated for my time. It was really annoying that this place moves so slow especially because some of the employees talk too much while the others work hard< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1531514588145, 'text': 'Hi Johnny, Thank you for sharing your feedback.

< Review>
Fast, friendly, and convenient. The hours are becoming wider in range to allow for various schedules. The check in process is absolutely quicker. First time donors receive Same if not more then the local competition. $75-1st, $50, $50, $50, $75. Then your compensation is according to wait. They have drawings and prizes for various things monthly. Bonuses on your 6th, 7th, & 8th donation in EACH month. The phlebotomist are great I use 3 of them. Not sure how more they've added. BEST PLACE</Review>

For first time doners you get $50 for your first 5 donations. From there you get 25$ for the first donation of the week and $40 for the second donation of the week.
The one in van nuys does give you 5$.

<Review>Called and asked about donating and was told to come on in. I made the hour long drive to get there and was turned away because they only had one nurse working and the board was full. They need to increase staffing for the 'busy' times. And now I get to drive the hour back home with a little over 2 hours of my time wasted. THANKS.<//Review><response>{'time': 1536092356602, 'text': 'Hi Danielle, Thank you for sharing your feedback.

When you choose an item to purchase from the racks, they actually give you a fresh one from the back. Nothing picked over or previously worn<//review>

We do not live in California so we are unable to go to the store! The clothing is flawless. We love the items and we always order from them! The only downside is it takes a couple of days to even get it shipped! But honestly that would not stop us from placing orders!!!</Review>

The atmosphere in the place is more like a hangout, chill spot, the staff makes you fell welcomed, willing to help you make that style, even helped me create a look but if you know what you want and got your size they hook you right up.  Oh Yeah Thea got sizes, mass supply of sweatclothes or get some help in store to place an order good quality gear.</review>

I wish I could rate this place better. The staff was all friendly and helpful except for Marshawn. We flew from out of town and were excited to check out the store... Mostly everything was way to big and had very little selection.
Marshawn walked around the store grunting and glaring at everyone and picking up trash spread all over the place. We spent quite a bit of money and when we asked for an autograph Marshawn snarled and said one minute; then proceeded to walk around and ignore the guy asking for the autograph. Everyone in the town talks poorly about him although the media says he does a lot for the community. Even the airport staff says when he’s off camera he’s a jerk even to kids.
Go to raider image and spend money there. It’s clear that they actually care you are in their store.</Text>

<text>Love this store, staff is exceptionally helpful ! I brought some beastmode candy bars back to Alabama for my boys,  originally from the bay, Everytime I walk in my 15 year olds bedroom I see the Tshirts and candy bars on display. I get a piece of home, thank you Beastmode !!

Efficient, cordial staff - very clear explanations when administering eye tests. Dr. Bream was on time, professional, and proficient.  She discovered two eye conditions that I was unaware of, and then administered two extra tests to give further depth to the analysis.   I felt well attended to by a highly competent Doctor.  I was very happy all around.  If I had 3 thumbs, I would give them 3 thumbs up!  Russ< /Text>

I appreciate being able to see a picture of my retina and be able to catch any early signs of problems. In addition to the normal vision test, they also do a peripheral vision test. Not something I have seen before, but it feels like a good thing to be aware of. The optometrist, Dr. Crews was friendly and helpful.

I'm 9 years old. I was constantly blinking big heavy blinks. My parents thought it was because I needed glasses but I thought I could see fine. My parents took me to see Dr Crews. I was really scared and nervous. Dr Crews was so nice and explained everything to me as she checked me. I really like that she did that. I needed glasses. Bummer. I could see so much better with the lenses. I cant wait until my glasses come. School and everything will be so much clearer. Thank you Dr Crews.</text>

Dr. Bream is professional and friendly. She remembers what her patients have shared with her, even when she sees them annually for an exam. She is thorough and makes you feel that your time with her is important and well spent. I have never had a problem with a prescription. Her assisting technicians are also extremely courteous and professional. I have been seeing her for years and will continue to do so.</review>

Very efficient optometry services offered. Everyone is always friendly and courteous. I came back to Dr. Cory Bream because she took time to explain in detail what she was looking for and why in explaining the digital retinal scans. This is the first optometrist that made me feel involved in knowing what to look for and why so it lessened my anxiety immensely.< /Text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Review>Just had my first eye exam w/ their new pandemic protocols in place.  Everything went smoothly. You need to call first to make an appointment.  They have the necessary cleaning protocols in place and they only allow one person in at a time.  As usual, Dr. Bream and her Team did a great job.  Best place in town by far.< /Review><user_id>100850339838708260708< /user_id></record>

Dr Bream is a kind, thorough professional.  She takes time to really care & explain diagnosis to me, her longtime patient.  I trust her and emphatically endorse her as my favorite optometrist in my life.<//Text>

<text>I always experience great service from the staff and doctors. The appointment making works well and it is not difficult finding good timing options.

Checking in is easy and I am always greeted cheerfully and treated with respect. The sequencing of tests and exams is friendly and efficiently done.

The doctors are all great clinicians. Terrific bedside manners, as well. I think highly of them.< /text>< Rate>

Have been going to Dr. Bream for many years now after trying others in town, first rate in every way. Staff has always been friendly and efficient, they move you through the process smoothly, Dr. Bream is incredibly thorough. They use state of the art equipment, and as a long-term customer can tell you they are always upgrading. Excellent service in every way, go nowhere else, you will be happy.<//text>

Outstanding visit. Dr. Bream makes the experience pleasant and works specifically addressing your needs. I had an issue that required looking outside the box for possible solutions. With Dr. Bream, I always leave the office knowing I’m receiving the best care possible.</review>

Dr. Bream uses state of the art equipment to determine your exact prescription needs. Testing was spot-on and my new lenses have me seeing better than I have in years. Definitely recommend her for your optometry needs!</Review>

<Review>They were on time, pleasant, and thorough.
I have waited hours at other optometrists’ office, listening to the staff chat.  At Costco they were professional and acted like my time is important too.
As a retired Nurse Practitioner, I know what to expect during an eye exam, and know no shortcuts were taken.
I definitely recommend Bream Optometry.<//Review>< Resp>

<Review>I would like to thank Dr. Bream and her staff for their efficiency and professionalism.  I had planned on merely setting up an appointment for a future visit.  However, Dr. Bream and her assistants were able to see me within a short period of time that day.  Dr. Bream was pleasant and very informative.  She took the time to answer all my questions (and there were many.)  I left with a prescription and sample contact lenses.  Thank you again.  I look forward to my followup.  And how often do patients get to say that?</Review></record></dataset><record>

I had an appointment today to see Dr. Debon Crews, the new associate optometrist in Dr. Bream's Optometry.  I found her very professional and knowledgeable. Before I entered her examination room I had a series of tests to see the condition of my eyes. These tests were very comprehensive and easy for me to complete. The staff was very helpful and knowledgeable.

I would recommend Dr Bream's office to anyone wishing to have an eye exam. As an added benefit, this office is in our local Costco making it easy to access.

<user_name>Christina Zhu<//user_name><review>The doctors there were really nice and professional and I had no problems getting contacts the first but the problem arose when I tried reordering contacts. My contacts prescription was due to expire so I tried ordering more contacts at Costco.com and I received a call a few days later from Bream, saying that I was unable to get anymore contacts because my contacts lens precription was due to expire. Nowhere does it say that you can't order contacts when your prescription is still valid, even if it was only 2 days left. I called another costco optomery to get a second opinion and the person there informed me that I was able to purchase contacts right up to the day that my perscription expires. So I dont understand why Bream wouldn't let me purchase contacts with a valid prescription.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Fantastic service and great professional staff. I had an amazing experience at Bream Optometry. The front office staff dealt with my insurance so quickly and knew exactly what was going on. The optometrist was really professional and spent a lot of time explaining my changing eyesight to me. I got all my eyeglass and contact prescriptions as I left. I didn't even need to ask for them! I am definitely going to stick with Bream Optometry from now on.<//Text>

Dr. Bream is such a pro and a pleasure to do business with. She makes it so easy and cost effective to get the same services I would pay a lot more for at other optometrists. She worked tirelessly to get my RX dialed in.

< review>
This is a great place to get an exam without the high-pressure sales job or unnecessary luxury of other optometrists. They always just give you the prescription without you having to fight them to give it to you. The lack of 5 stars from me is because they have a convenient online appointment system that doesn't seem connected to the front office. I was confirmed by the online appointment system but the front office had no record of my appointment. Nevertheless they saw me right away anyway.< /review>

this office made me feel comfortable that they were doing best practices to move clients through the office with clean surfaces and room to avoid crowding.

Excellent service! State-of-the-Art Optometry Care and testing for your eyes. Very helpful, thoughtful and completely first class experience. Do not hesitate to make an appointment, you will be amazed at how  thorough your eye exam will be. My doctor was complete, very detailed, and made each test, and the results very understandable during the process.

You will see what I am talking about!<//review>

< Review>
Exam for glasses & contact lenses.

My first U.S. eye exam. Being a Brit, now living in Santa Barbara,  a long time glasses wearer, I wasn't sure if the process would be any different. I couldn't have been more pleased with the professionalism, friendliness and overall quality of the experience.

I'd have no hesitation in recommending Amanda and the rest of the team at Bream Optometry in Costco.< /Review>

<text>I needed an eye exam as I felt my vision was slipping a bit so I went to visit my local OD, Cory Bream. After leaving I realized why I've been going back for close to a decade. As I walked into the office (it was a very busy day) Cory was assisting an elderly woman with her wheel chair. Before seating the woman she let her know she had locked the wheels and that she could lean on her. I was very touched by her kindness as this was a very rare site to see. In the middle of helping her she managed to ask me if I had been greeted by the staff which I had been. While waiting for my turn the staff managed quite well for the amount of patients that were there. They gave me a few different eye tests and were very personable(not just your normal take care of business so we can get you out of here in a hurry atmosphere). I appreciated the quality time. After that I saw Cory, the consummate professional. She has a superlative attention to detail and yet puts you at ease with her down to earth conversational style. In the end I needed glasses and started wearing them this very same afternoon and am truly relieved that my vision was taken care of in a timely, courteous and professional manner by all involved. As a former Retail Manager I can attest to the highest quality of care by Cory Bream OD and staff.</text><name>Alonzo Beadle<//name>< rating>

<text>The doctors are good. I would give them 4 stars for the high level of quality treatment I received. The front desk associates do not provide good service. I arrived before my scheduled appointment and still had to wait 30min before seeing the doctor. Also, I still have not received an itemized receipt for my visit so I can submit to insurance.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Dr. Bream is a very nice person and good listner. But I think she need to think about her current front desk team performance.

Dr. Bream is the best. Her competentancy in getting my prescription right for what was important to me was spot on. I wanted to see clearly at a distance for golf and driving, she adjusted my Rx perfectly. I won't go anywhere else. Also her suggestions to keep my eyesight and eyes healthy are appreciated. Thanks Doc!</review>

Bream Optometry is great! I was having problems with my old glasses, went in for a check up and was quite impressed with the friendly and efficient staff. The office was clean and i appreciated that everything was wiped down before each patient. Dr. Bream listened to my concerns and made me feel confident that my new prescription would be perfect.</review>

<text>The whole process was smooth and efficient.  Everyone was courteous, and the wait was very short.  Dr. Andersen answered my questions, and really listened to my needs, as evidenced by perfect eyeglass prescriptions (reading, computer, TV).  I've been disappointed with other places in the past.  I'm thrilled to have found a winner!</text>< pictures>

<Review>When I entered for my appointment the Dr had been complaining that someone had left him a bad review which I thought was interesting. Then in the MIDDLE of my appointment he took another patient making me wait with uncomfortable contact lenses in my eyes. I have never in my life dealt with this. I will not be returning to this Dr he overall was unsettling.< /Review><Response>{'time': 1555267809830, 'text': 'When patients come in for contacts it is common the doctor will need the contact to sit on the eye for 5-10 minutes in order for it to be settled and positioned right on individual eyes. This is because all contacts are made differently for different vision needs. It is with that time the doctor gives you the opportunity to adjust to the contacts for clear vision. At times this may feel uncomfortable and we do apologize you had to wait but it is for your benefit that we take this time in order to find the right fit. During that time doctors will begin with another patient to get them started in order to keep our office on schedule. The doctor you saw is a wonderful doctor but we also have three other optometrists who can be of service to you at your next visit. Bad reviews are always concerning as we take our jobs seriously and try to make everyone feel welcome. It is important to us that our true care shows through. Thank you.'}< /Response><user>117774239924219236792< /user><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< GmapID>

My husband and I have been patients of Dr. Breams's for many, many years. My father even used to drive over from Bakersfield to see Dr. Bream before he got too old to drive. Dr. Bream is professional, kind, and honest. If she has any concerns about your eye health she takes the time to explain . Her staff is efficient and courteous. Every time I come for my annual exam there is a new piece of equipment so her office is very state of the art. She is straight forward and will let you know if your correction hasn't changed enough to warrant a change of your presciption. I recommend Dr. Bream to all of my friends.< /text>

<review>I have been coming to Bream Optometry for about 6 years or so and I keep coming back for a reason. Accessible hours, affordable out-of-pocket costs for exams and visits since I don't have Vision insurance, good service, knowledgeable doctors, up-to-date equipment for vision testing, and good overall experience. I have some high risk factors for my eyes due to family history, and I feel confident that my eyes are well looked after by Drs. Bream and Anderson.</review><username>E.

Let's be honest - we don't know how good the optometry experience is going to be at a clinic inside a big box store (Costco). Well, I've been to a few optometrists in my day, and thanks to my decreasing insurance coverage, this was an affordable option. Bottom line: The best experience I've ever had. I had an appt and never waited to get in. Dr. Carter Anderson and his professional staff couldn't have been more thorough, attentive and polite. They not only gave me a complete eye test, but checked for signs of cataracts and glaucoma. I received a free test pair of contacts and my follow up appt will not be charged for. All in all, an excellent experience. I couldn't recommend them more.</text>

I have been going to Drs. Bream or Anderson here for close to a decade. I am very picky about my medical providers, and my optometrist is no exception. This office keeps up on having the best equipment and is very fairly priced. I have had to pay out of pocket for vision up until this year. And I still paid out of pocket to keep coming here as they were not providers for my vision insurance.

Plan ahead and make an appointment, it will keep your waiting time to a minimum. Though, they do take walk-ins. Even if you don't have a Costco membership, you can tell the people at the door you are there to see the optometrist and be allowed in. I highly recommend Bream Optometry</review>

<Text>I visited the office on 12.14.12 around 4:30 pm.
I have a negative review to write not because of the doctor in this office - the doctor was professional as expected but because of the receptionist. She was the most impolite receptionist I have ever met. I would say she had some personal dislike for me because my husband has good impressions from her. I don't say that she has to show great affection, but she should stay professional and help customers with answering to their questions politely and not acting as she is bothered with some unimportant chat. I was having an insurance related question and if she is a good receptions (which she is not) she should try to answer my question or if she doesn't know the answer, she should politely say so without demonstrating to me her irritation. Also she is very children unfriendly. She was clearly annoyed by my two toddlers (who are good kids but like every toddler they toddle a lot) and she didn't make any effort to hide it. I had to run to the office because it was sort of an emergency situation. I didn't have time to arrange a babysitter, that's why I just grabbed my kids and headed to the office. Instead of understanding I got hostility, which you wouldn't expect from an office that accepts emergency cases. In future I will try some other office. Too bad because I am a great fan of Costco!<//Text>< rating>

<GmapID>0x80e940ae68dce3df:0x61f3eb8e8bdc8bcd<//GmapID><Text>Best eye doctor ever !   Walked in, because the DMV had some concerns with the eyes of my 16 year old daughter. The staff, especially Milena, were extra friendly and took us straight away.  Dr. Andersen was the most competent eye doctor we have ever met and after thorough yet rapid testing, came to the exact right conclusion.  Our daughter is now wearing a single contact lense, which she loves and got her DMV certificate the same day.

We will come back !

Very happy !</Text><rating>5< /rating>< Resp>
