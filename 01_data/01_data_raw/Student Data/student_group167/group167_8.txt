I have been living here for about a year and half now and whenever I need something like maintenance or a parking pass they are always friendly and helpful. Even when I had a noisy tenant above me, they worked diligently to find me a new apt that fit my needs and made it a smooth transition. The amenities are great! The hot tub is super nice and the gym is great.</Review>

I normally don't do detailed reviews of places until I fully immerse myself in the experience but I feel that I have experienced enough in this short time to write a comprehensive review.  I am currently a resident of the complex that is about a week into my year lease.  Our initial experience was quite pleasant.  Our agent Yvette was very courteous from the very beginning! She was very upfront about the apartment layouts, the amenities and what the neighborhood feel is like.  She even showed us a model unit and explained to us what they have available.  Now as for the application progress itself, that was a breeze!! Due to covid restrictions most of the process was done online.  It also helped that we had all our documents in order and ready to present to help speed up the process (i.e proof of income, job and rental history) We were very nervous at first because this is our first rental as a couple and we are both working on building our credit.  We were not sure if we qualified for the place.  After a few tense days of waiting, we got the news we hoped for!! We had qualified and after a few simple signatures on a electronic document that clearly states all the details and obligations, we got the keys to our apartment.  This process could not have been any easier if it wasn't for the kind and awesome service Yvette provided...
Our apartment has met all of our expectations! We have met some of our neighbors and are very happy that they are just as nice as we are! The playground is great place for my little boy and he enjoys it every time! We haven't had a chance to experience the pools or gyms that come with our place, but I'm sure when the weather heats up and when we get over this pandemic, that will be the first areas we try!  For now we are simply just enjoying the peace and quiet and cleanliness that this area has offered us.
Now, the only issue that I have and that everyone else has shared in these reviews is the parking.  We bit the bullet and payed for one garaged unit for my wife and I simply park wherever I can find a non reserved space.  So far it hasn't been a major issue, but I can see that depending on the time of day you arrive home, you can easily find yourself driving around desperately looking for a space.  I have been fortunate enough to have found a spot not too far from my apartment each time I needed it.  But I feel that this might become a problem in the future.  I might have to pay a little extra and get a reserved space.  I have also observed that they are very few open visitor spots available for guests.  I can never seem to find one for my visitors and notice that a few of the same vehicles constantly taking those spots.  Finally, I have observed that some vehicles out of desperation for a place to park resort to parking in front of garages or red spaces. I personally don't mind it cause I feel their pain but it makes me question the true enforcement of this parking policy.  I was led to believe that they tow you immediately if you violate parking regulations.  I chalk this up to Covid restrictions and hope that this issue gets resolved sooner rather than later.
Overall, we love this place! A great area with a great staff and a great community!!! Location was key for us since its soo close to freeways and essential shopping centers.  I would definitely recommend this place to my friends.......but warn  them about the parking and suggest they pay the extra for the garage or reserved spaces.< /Text>

Be very careful if you sign an online contract. They may renig on the contract for what ever reason, in my case it was because they wanted to go up on my rent. Make sure you get their signature first.< /review>

I have lived here for just a few months and I am already COMPLETELY disappointed with the customer service and how unprofessional the people here are. Believe me if I could move out I would but my dumb bum signed a lease for a year and now I am stuck. Almost every single person that works at this office either doesn't like their job, and it shows, or they are a temp there for a few days and have NO idea how to do anything. I have asked to speak to a manager more than 15 times (not exaggerating) and I have never gotten a call back. My mailbox got broken into and it’s been weeks that I have had to go to the post office to pick up my mail. Every single time I call they tell me about new inconvenient policies that have been implemented. For example I use to be able to call in and order a parking pass to then pick up later when I am off work. Now they are telling me I need to go in person to both order and pick it up HOWEVER when you walk into the office to get one it takes about 15 minutes because everyone in there is "busy" sitting at their desk with their, not so friendly faces. Asking the people who work here for a favor is like pulling teeth and I absolutely do not appreciate the attitude I get when I pay so much for an apartment. When I first moved in I thought to myself no big deal, in all seriousness how often would I need to speak to anyone in the office anyway right? No, you do have to constantly have contact with them because of the way they have everything set up and it’s a nightmare. This complex is beautiful it’s well kept, the tenants are nice, and the amenities are wonderful but the people that manage and operate this place are just not to par. I have worked in customer service for 7 years and I am very aware of the attitude it takes when speaking to someone who pays money for a service.< /review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>The incompetence of the property managers are staggering and knows no bounds.  I moved out in the middle of a month because that was when my lease ended, they failed to figure out how to prorate my account in their system and so I was served multiple three day notices to pay up and threatened legal action (see photo).  I spent weeks calling and physically coming in after I moved out trying to sort this and eventually got it cleared.  At the same time I was doing this, they failed to send me my final move out list and what was owed.  During the weeks I spent talking with them, they never once said anything about 'losing' my forwarding  address (but the constant threats and notices about not paying the full month certainly didn't have any issues arriving in the mail at my new place!) and so back on the phone I go to get the landlord to send me that.

Finally sorted, I eventually receive my final move out list and what I owe well after the legal 21 days and it shows I owe about $10 bucks.  Also what arrived with the bill?  A notice saying I've been sent to collections for failing to pay this.

Yup, I was sent to collections for failing to pay $10 because they failed to deliver the bill in the legal amount of time.  Never did they call me, never did they respond to any of my requests regarding what I owed, never did they make ANY EFFORT AT ALL to get me this critical piece of information.  I would take them to court for every infraction of the law they violated, but they mailed the bill/list in a non-descriptive generic, hand written envelope with no return address so I have no proof of their bumbling and I didn't bother to record any of my conversations with them.<//Review>< Pictures>

The only drawback is the traffic noise is much louder than anticipated.  We have to sleep w/ earplugs.  But other than that, it's a quiet, pretty, peaceful environment.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<review>Tenants are worse than management. Yes it is bad that they only give a warning. However, did you call the police? Did you call security? and the parking, there is plenty, but everyone is so lazy! tenants even get disabled placards just to park in the disabled spots, especially near the Church St. entrance. Quit the lazy, quit driving inside the space as if your apartment is going to fly off like Dorothy's house if you do not go 50mph inside the parking. Walk! and the dogs....why do tenants keep leaving their dogs without a leash? plus, they NEVER ever pick up the darn poop! that is another reason they let their dogs roam around with no leash, have several on video. just because they are small dogs, does not mean they are harmless or that they cannot get hurt! You get what you give, so it looks like all the complainers are not giving good tenancy.

I do give them a three star because the apartments are old, and rent is way too high for the quality and state of apartments. apartments are made to look nice then you start living in them and find out doors are broken and only patched, dishwashers are old and painted over to look new. they do not keep tenants on check when supposed to. The smell of marihuana is also very prevalent around the place especially at night, again tenants misbehaving.  Otherwise, I do like the location and the main office manager is nice. the lady that is.<//review>< date>

<review>We recently moved out after being there for around 18 months .
The swimming pool area is amazing and my girls loved spending most of their time there.The bbqs are all new ,the grounds are very well looked after and the gyms here are good too.
All the staff in the office are friendly and we dealt with Yvette a lot who is lovely .The parking here is obviously a nuisance if you have more than 1 car .Its simple if you don’t have a permit or you can’t find a space it’s not worth the risk and you may as well park out in a road outside .We only had one car and also we managed to get a visitor permit every time for an evening and people came to visit with no problems .
It isn’t cheap to live here but you do get what you pay for with pool and gym and to be fair it is California where nothing is cheap!Be Warned though you pretty much are guaranteed not to get your deposit back fully .I knew as soon as I walked around the apartment originally it had been professionally cleaned and had been painted in places ..There’s no way it’s going to be left like that by the last tenant unless they didn’t live there!
The deposit isn’t a lot anyway and is enough to cover a cleaner and a handy man to tart the place up!So my advice don’t bother with cleaning when you leave ,it’s not worth the hassle for a minimal deposit return which you will not receive back 100% I guarantee!
Overall I enjoyed living here and have good memories and everyone who I met here was very friendly !< /review>< gmap_id>

<Pics>None</Pics><text>Don’t move here!! Don’t let the gates fool you. People wander in here vandalizing cars and besides that, even if your car is registered here you are not guaranteed to find parking. If you find parking you have to have a pass for your car and any other guests that you have to have printed between the hours of 9-5pm that includes a signature, car description and license plate. The apartment complex AND the towing have a deal together and split the profits of towing (stealing) your car and making you pay $300 each day they hold it. You’d be better off living in the ghetto in an ungated community. If someone stole your car you wouldn’t be forced to pay $300 or more to get it back and it wouldn’t be legally stolen.</text>< name>

<text>Parking is terrible.. even if you have a blue sticker. If you cannot find parking late at night, you will just be forced to sleep in your vehicle or get towed. Management does not care about this issue nor will they help you in any way. According to the manager, I should monitor other parked vehicles (throughout the night) to see if they have blue stickers and if they don't.. I should contact security to have them towed.. I find this to be unacceptable and outrageous.</text><pics>None< /pics><time>1536950649302<//time>< Gmap_id>

< review>
stars if you are thinking of renting an apartment at Barrington Place be aware you will lose your deposit because the management will not follow the law and give you an itemized list of costs charged against your deposit. I have been awarded 2 small claims judgements and they not only don't pay them but they ignore the judgements.

My one bedroom and a loft is a bit expensive  and parking can be a pain but other than that this place is perfect, with the exception  of a few opportunist thieves who probably aren't from the complex.. I really wish they would keep the gates closed all the time.. this problem seems to be somewhat half our fault for not locking your cars or leaving your garage open unattended, and the management could help by closing the gate during the day.. I've already noticed people driving around the complex looking for open garages, we got our car cleared out which to be honest was half my brothers fault for leaving his car unlocked and the garage open for "5 mins" so he would get to work on time.. even if I believed him which I don't, nice cars unlocked in open garages has easily take whatever you want. His car got ransacked, loss some things of sentimental and expensive value and still won't admit he forgot to lock it and somehow the garage key got clicked on accident.. since then have noticed cars making rounds to find opportunity in, to be honest again. people's negligence.. Other than that family's living together is none of my business even if it bothered me, it doesn't.. I'm sure the tow truck company is not paying management anything, im sure what they both make is more than sufficient, just stop parking in reserved spots that aren't yours and your fine. Common courtesy works both ways pick up after your dog pls.. and this is a apartment complex so get a leash or risk your dog getting run over especially if it's small. I absolutely would hate that sad situation cause I love dogs. Also would be 100% your own fault these streets are narrow and I doubt someone would do it just because..< /text>

< Review>
This place is a absolute $hitho** they prey on residents to move in just to tow their vehicles and split their profits with Steve’s towing not only that prepare to have your car searched by tweeker degenerates working for the tow company and things stolen by them as well. That’s just 1 issue of very many not to mention all the ghetto people that live in this place, and if you come after 7pm good luck finding any parking there’s families of 5 living in 2 bedroom apartments here. And the manager Resden is an absolute scumbag who’s out for profits not for the people it’s typical corporate greed run while you can so glad we are getting a house and getting the hell out before we are reamed anymore by these crooks!</Review>

<date>1415212764371</date><Rate>4<//Rate><review>I've been living here since the end of August, and overall, I think its a good place to live, especially for the price. The property is beautiful. The best looking, and the best kept apartments in their price range. The 9' ceilings really make my 1 bedroom apartment feel spacious. The parking is my biggest complaint. The lack of visitor parking is really frustrating. A lot of times, I have to have my guests park down the street at the shopping center, and then bus them back up to my apartment. I've read about some people complaining because they got towed. That really isn't an issue if you follow the rules. Just park where you're supposed to. Also, the staff can be a little less than pleasurable to deal with. I haven't had any really bad experiences, but they could stand to be a bit more professional. Last issue is the pet policy. I'm a dog person and was looking forward to getting a new dog when I moved in. I found that they have a very strict breed restriction policy. They won't even allow French bulldogs. That's pretty ridiculous if you ask me.
When considering how nice the apartments are, and how they're priced, I think that it's a great place to live. Spacious, well kept, modern... I highly recommend this apartment complex.</review>< Pics>

<Pics>None</Pics><Text>I used to love living here until my issues with my downstairs neighbors.. Last year in November my neighbors were blasting their radio on the porch so I went downstairs and told them to keep it down.. They continued to play the music loud enough to shake my floor..so I called the cops.. The cops came out and told them to keep it down, this set them off so they go outside our window and balcony and start cursing loud as they can calling fiancé and I names! She is plastered drunk because they get drunk every weekend on there porch religiously! She threatens my fiancé and I and at the time my 8 month son ! I catch her yelling and cursing on video , go to the office the next morning tell them everything that happened and submit the video proof and they just give them a warning.. So they continue to live under us and have continuously been loud .. Over the last 4 months I have written down every incident and recorded more video proof of their loud music and loud tv that bumps through the floor and wakes up my son! I go to the office the other day and submit another complaint and give them videos and notes over the last 4 months and still just a warning. I ask to transfer apartments the rent is higher and the won't waive the deposit on the new apartment. I am extremely unhappy here and am trapped ! Also the parking is horrible! I wanted to share this with the public before they decide to move in!<//Text>< username>

<Review>Wow where to start? Let's start by my only compliment. The facilities are beautiful. Okay that being said. They are VERY strict about their contract UNLESS it works against them. Example: A few weekends ago there was this car whose alarm went off allllllllllll night. No sleep. We called their after hours number to send patrol over who has a specific responsibility of dealing with after hours noises. They said they dispatched them but they never came. Okay well we got over it because it was a mistake for one night. We got over it even though they showed they didn't care, they dropped the ball, and it is in their contract to tow cars that honk longer than 10 minutes according to their employees (let alone 7 hours). Well then the very next weekend IT HAPPENED AGAIN and I had to work the next morning. This time there were three of the tenants out there calling the after hours number. Well after calling them 3 times the patrol person came and said he could do nothing. It seemed like he didn't care much or was to lazy to do his job which is to tow cars. So he left without doing anything! I called the number back to see what they could do, this time they hung up on me. I wasn't even being rude. We finally called the cops to get someone to do something. We wanted to coordinate with the patrol to get rid of the problem so we could sleep but the patrol person wouldn't come anymore. We noticed that there was a temporary pass in the cars window. All they had to do was call that number associated with the temp pass in the window somehow. The patrol car wouldn't come anymore because he was avoiding the situation instead of trying to help. NO ONE did there job and we didn't get any sleep. So the next day the car was still honking when the employees got there. Then they started to care because it was close to their office too. After work I went in to tell them the story and they said it should have been towed. They said a worker name Crissy would call me but it had been a week and she nor any manager called. I decided to go in and ask for compensation for those 2 nights. A little over 100$ prorated for the month. They said absolutely not even though in their contract they did not do their job. Trust me if you do anything to go against their contract they WILL make you pay.  I guess since they are a big company they didn't care enough to make up for their mistakes, only your mistakes.

Rule 1 for an apartment complex: have enough parking. The parking here is atrocious. Some nights I have to walk from the other end of the complex to my room. If you get in late forget about good parking. If you have visitors forget about parking. The appliances of the apartment are all very cheap. Luckily they do have good service men because the appliances are always breaking. Their faucets constantly leak. And remember how I said its a beautiful place well overall. The walls are sloppily painted, their crown molding awkwardly just ends, and our fridge wasn't cooling (they did change it after it wasn't cooling a month).

They are sticklers about their contract when it is in their favor, not yours. They have a policy that says you can't have more than two guests at the pool. We asked permission if we could have 4 guests at the pool in the middle of the day because my inlaws were in town. DENIED. No one else was at the pool. Also we had dogs for a few days that were being polite indoor dogs but they said we had to pay for them for the month. Once again I get that they have to follow the rules. But it should go both ways don't you think.

Lastly, after you stay here one year your contract does not go month to month unless you pay like 500$ more a month. So if you want to stay here you can never leave unless it is exactly at your year mark. So unless you plan on seeing the future and knowing exactly when you have to leave I wouldn't choose this place. I'm already stuck but I'd choose another high end apartment nearby that understands they should provide a service.</Review><Name>Rick Buck< /Name><Rating>3</Rating>< user>

(Translated by Google) For me, I have a terrible service to the people who live there, it is difficult to find parking, when you ask for a procedure they are late and they make mistakes and not only that they promised to give me a queche because I recommended a friend and he already lives here and does more than Four months and I still don't get the milk. WE WEAR

(Original)
Para mi, tinene un pesimo servicio a las personas que vivimos ahi, es dificil encontrar estacionamiento, cuando pides un tramite son tardados y comen errores  y no solo eso prometieron darme un queche porque recomende a un amigo y el ya vive aqui y hace mas de cuatro meses y el queche aun no me lo dan.

Amazing empanadas. Better than a lot of the empanadas I had in Argentina.
These are much larger than Argentinian empanadas and the dough is much better than anything I could find in Buenos Aires.
I highly recommend the beef and the mushroom empanadas. Chicken was good But the other two are better unless you don't eat beef or mushroom and cheese.
Also you absolutely have to get the chocolate croissant they make using Mexican chocolate and a coffee with it.< /review>

So grateful to have this little gem within walking distance. Owner, Diana, is charmer and her staff are super friendly. If you're lucky enough, you'll have Diana make you a mocha! So worth it and she's open for take out during the shelter in place order!< /review>

Great Cafe with tasteful Argentinean empanadas.
The best, they have vegetarian options.
Met the owner, is an amazing care person and accessible to talk with.
I'll recommend to friends and will keep visiting.. you can also get some Argentinean wine.
Keep it up Cafe Buenos Aires!<//Review>

< review>
Located prominently as the northeastern corner of intersecting Ashby and Shattuck, just a block from the Berkeley Bowl or two to BART, this owner-operated cafe brings unique flavor to the neighborhood. A taste of Argentina's famed cuisine, a full coffee and tea bar and a wall-sized cooler of refreshing Italian sodas, waters and pilsners. And wifi.

Traditional empanadas are also offered with updated vegetarian or vegan versions.

Argentina is a nation of immigrants so has a cultural tapestry rich in different foods with choices of ingredients from spinach and feta, and mushroom-gorganzola to facon-bacon or meatless Italian sausage. The empanadas for the sweet-tooth include fruits and berries. And they serve quiches.

Large windows facing south and west make for a bright, cheerful setting matching their friendly service. Sit indoors at tables or bar; outdoors a row of cafe tabled seating is completed at one end with generous water and food bowls for the dog[s].<//review>

<Text>Went on May 2nd, 2020. I was trying to get some pick up,  but most restaurants are closed due to COVID.  I came up this cute cafe with an adorable owner, papa-mama shop feel. We ordered on their website ahead of time. The food was made fresh and OMG sooooooooo good, that it is memorable. This place is a street down from Berkeley Bowl. I would definitely order pick up by call or order online ahead of time and enjoy the hot fresh empanadas and coffee. We found an empty street corner and devoured empanadas. I had chicken and corns. My boy had two other flavors. We were sooooo happy. All the flavors were amazing. I am a coffee lover and I love the latte. I am so grateful the owner still working to provide amazing food for the community.  Glad to support small business owner during this time.</Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Just opened almost two months ago, and the business owners here are incredibly friendly, warm, and helpful. They have sandwiches, vegan and veggie empanadas, quiches, a whole coffee bar, beer and soft drinks among other food and drinks. This is my new go-to place in Berkeley!!!</Text>

First time visit to Cafe Buenos Aires was a wonderful experience. Owner / chef Diana was very accomodating recommending home made and delicious beef and chicken empanadas. The alfajores were great too!  Viva Argentina!</text>

Gorgeous outdoor venue for weddings, public functions, wine pairing, and BBQ get togethers.  Nice outdoor facilities for dining, dancing with a pleasant grassy area - all based at the foothills in quaint San Benito County.  Gorgeous views in a historical setting.  Highly recommended!<//Review>

We stayed here recently through Harvest Hosts.  Great people in a beautiful place. Very relaxing. We picked up some of the best bacon I’ve ever eaten, eggs, steak and some sausage. I hope to be back in the area soon!< /Text>

<review>Beautiful space! The little cottages were comfortable, the kitchen in the main house is not fully stocked and made it difficult to use. There where no cutting boards, knifes and other staples that made it tricky.</review>< Pics>

We have been using internet phones and our system completely crashed.  We were trying to get a new system that would allow us to keep the same number and we filed paperwork to keep it without any luck.  I just got an email this morning that our phones will be up next week with a new number.  I have been giving everyone that reaches  me by email my cell phone number for the past two months.  Again, I am so sorry, this inconvenience with the phone has been awful for everyone!  Unfortunately your earring has not been found.  After each wedding, we carefully check the floors of the barn before we blow it out because we don't want any trash or debris blown into our grounds.  I will keep an eye out for it outside and if it turns up, I will contact you.  Can you please email me with all of your contact information at mary@paicinesranch.com.  Thank you and again, I apologize for all of the trouble you've had to go through!"}< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<review>We were guests at a wedding over a month ago. When I got home and realized I lost my gold earring, I immediately tried to contact them in hopes it was found during the clean up. Their phones don’t ring, they don’t respond to emails, even the bride tried to reach someone with no response. What kind of venue advertises as a wedding venue and doesn’t answer the phone. I’m hoping this review will get their attention to respond to my request for help. My next attempt to get ahold of someone is through snail mail 😏</review><userid>104562022984583689632</userid><time>1562941811161<//time>< Pictures>

It is a site committed to sustainability and they take care of their lands responsibly, the landscapes are very beautiful and it is worth going to enjoy nature. Good place for birding.

This is the 3rd time in a different day, they cancelled my order. Says usually as busy as it gets, and it's clearly not busy. They are just lazy. Don't recommend you order postmates from here or any delivery service< /review>

The place is clean and here is something calming and refreshing doing yoga in candlelight.  I cannot wait until my next class!  They have other genres of music each week.  I will be back soon!</Review>

<text>Yoga Salt Los Angeles is the best hot yoga studio in CA in my opinion! The studios are really clean and the teachers are great and very friendly. They offer a ton of classes daily so you fit in a class before or after work if needed!< /text>< Pictures>

Yoga Salt Los Angeles from Orange County. My hot yoga place in the OC is a smelly room of musty carpet which made this place such a beautiful place to visit. Loved taking  Yoga Salt Los Angeles and getting to stare up at the beautiful pitched wood ceiling.<//Text>

While visiting my daughter I stopped in at Yoga Salt and was so glad I did. The front desk attendant was very welcoming and helpful and made me feel like a local. I took 4 classes from 4 different teachers during my stay and each class was challenging, interesting and fun. I was very impressed with the quality of the teachers, attention of staff, and cleanliness of the studio. It was a great find and made my trip complete. Thank you Yoga Salt for welcoming visitors and providing high quality asana in a comfortable setting.</review>

<text>Yoga Salt is a small and intimate studio. It is always neat, the staff are attentive, and the yoga instructors are knowledgeable. Each instructor has his/her own strengths and approach to their practice, and all share the ability to deepen my practice, helping me find my edge. I typically leave feeling a little more centered and a bit sore (in a good way) the next day. The classes do get very full, so come early and be respectful of sharing space (everyone usually is).<//text>< user_id>

I think soothing music is better during yoga. Loud club music is not my style, especially turning the volume up and down. The yoga itself was good. Better than some other places I've been. If you like power yoga you'll like Yoga Salt.<//Review>

I have been practicing daily at Yoga Salt for years. Each teacher is unique and highly skilled in their awareness of the strengthening and healing of yoga. The style is a brawn focused vinyasa flow allowing meditation while moving.  The community is grounded in love, kindness and friendliness. This is a yoga studio you can call home.</Review>

< Review>
This has been my go-to yoga studios for the last several years now. I’ve been to many different yoga studios in my lifetime and this one has consistently been my favorite. This is a studio that teaches authentic yoga as healing, not just the typical exercise-do-crazy-poses-LA yoga. I love the teachings behind the practice and the intentionality of the instructors (or the ones I’ve taken at least). They are attentive, friendly, offer good adjustments, have great flows, and share their knowledge. Some end with a beautiful song, mantra, or Om, which I LOVE. Oh and they also play the best music!!

It’s the perfect blend of mind and body work. I always get a good sweat, stretch, and mind + spirit detox. Challenging yet relaxing and rewarding at the end.

A couple of my friends have done the yoga teacher training with the owner, Tamal, and I hope to as well one day!

I almost don’t want to share about this studio becuase I don’t want this place to get too crowded! But sharing is caring though, right? :)<//Review>

Great focus on breath, but a little distracting when the teacher starts belting mantras at the end of class. I’ve had two instructors here that do that, so be prepared so you don’t start laughing like I almost did the first time.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

This is one of the best studios I have been to. It is simple and is very no frills, which I appreciate. I go to JJ's classes and he is a fantastic teacher. They are tough and definitely get you the workout you want. When you are leaving you don't feel drained, but rather restored. I have really enjoyed Devavani's classes as well. The introductory offer for new students is probably the best deal in Mar Vista/Culver City. My only wish is that they offered an earlier class on weekday mornings so I could go before work. I highly recommend this studio for new yogis!</Text>

<Review>Nice clean studio with vinyasa classes. You sweat from working out, and not excessive heat. I liked all the instructors I have tried so far, and it is nice that they also offer a couple of community classes. They have limited free parking in the back. I don’t know why they don’t have more midday classes on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. It would be nice if they did.< /Review>< Pics>

I came into town for the Labor Day  weekend and really wanted to get some yoga in. I was delighted to find Yoga Salt. The lover of vinyasa that I am, I was excited to try it out. I took Liz’s class and was so energized from the sweaty salty mess that I turned into that I decided to come back the next day and take JJ’s class. Wow! Another fantastic experience. Yoga Salt was wonderful. The staff was very nice, helpful and the environment there was invigorating. I will definitely be back!
Thank you for helping make my weekend so awesome!< /Review>

<Review>I have been going to yoga salt for about 3 or 4 years now.  It is my favorite yoga studio in LA, and I have been practicing for over 25 years and have tried studios all over the city.  The teachers are exceptional and the prices are reasonable. The people who practice there are wonderful too, like a little family.  It is a friendly atmosphere, not snotty or intimidating.  I have actually never had a bad experience there.  It does get crowded on weekends, especially in the mornings, so get there early or book online.  I think last time I reviewed Yoga Salt I called it my sanctuary, and this is still true.< /Review>< Resp>

<review>All around good vibes here. The front desk was friendly and welcoming. The instructor, JJ, introduced himself to me when he learned it was my first time.

The class was full (Friday 4:30pm) and I showed up kind of later than I’d have liked, but I was able to find a spot without any trouble.

The room was much hotter than I anticipated. That’s not to say it was too hot, I just didn’t realize I had signed up for a heated yoga class.

JJ had some very unique cues that helped me find new shapes in poses I’ve practiced many times before. I appreciated his instruction.

While this is a personal opinion, I felt disconnected to the music and felt the playlist lacked cohesiveness between songs with regards to energy, volume level, and vibe.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80c2ba861f589049:0xb8eaf6487522cd76< /gmap_id></record>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>Incredible Instructors.  Isn't that all that matters?  Liz Arch is my top pick.  The location and facility are very simple and austere.  It helps clear your mind and get to business.  Yes, the class can be crowded, but everyone works together and the quiet camaraderie only adds to the practice of caring, engaging and being mindful.  I love a class where sweat drips from my nose.  Since you can't respond to other "critics" on here, I want to address them here:  If the instructors are good, that's all that matters.  Sweat smell and available showers are silly.<//Text>< Pictures>

First time at Yoga Salt. I appreciated the teacher, Alex.  It was a full class, but she was able to work around the room. She had a great playlist for the restorative portion of the class. I wish they offered more ying and yang classes, as full as this one was I would think it would be another hit.<//review>

Always an amazing experience at Yoga Salt! Beautiful studio with a zen, non-corporate, neighborhood feel. Front desk peeps are always friendly and make an effort to know you by name, unlike other chain yoga studios where you are just another dollar. Instructors are awesome, I have my favorites but honestly any class I have ever been to has been challenging and sweaty so no matter when you go you are guaranteed a great workout for your body and mind. Highly reccommend you check it out and get Salty! Namaste!< /Review>

To put this review into context, I am an 8-year practitioner of Yoga, 20+ year martial artist, and lifetime fitness enthusiast.  Without hesitation or doubt, Sesa O'Connor and JJ Cook both rank in my top 3 instructors of all time.  I practice consistently under their guidance (2-4 times per week), and to date, I have never been underwhelmed or ever felt their classes were just satisfactory.  Their passion for teaching yoga can be heard through their detailed explanations and is expressed through their masterful and intelligently thought out sequences. I am very grateful to have both of them in my life (even only if it is for a few hours a week).< /text>

never done a yoga class before, went in on a whim tuesday, got dazzled by the endless enthusiasm and kindness of all the staff i spoke to so i came back thursday for my first class lol got my butt kicked by alex.. they were precise in their instruction and offered a beginner-friendly range of adjustments and modifications for all moves. i'll definitely be going back for more. if ur like me, the salt is from all the sweat, consider bringing a towel< /text>

Yoga Salt transformed my life! Incredible instructors and the most welcoming vibe. If you're new to yoga the instructors and students' impressive form and difficulty can be intimidating (friends I've taken there have said this), but this is a place of no judgement and the instructors are super passionate in helping their students wherever they are. Shout out to Tamal, Sesa, Stephen, Yvonne and JJ for helping me improve my form leaps and bounds over a course of a year. My practice has dropped off since that year, my gains are permanent. Thank you Yoga Salt for always being there whenever I need to take a moment for myself on the mat.<//Review>

<Name>Kimberly R. Kelly</Name><Review>After practicing for 15 years and being fiercely loyal to Bryan Kest Power Yoga studio in Santa Monica, I was loathe to find a new studio following a relocation to a beach city. No other studios seemed to fit the ethos that I was looking for: the chain studios were too transactional, the smaller studios were inconsistent, and it was nearly impossible to find vinyasa classes that were over an hour. Finally, I found Yoga Salt! The teachers are so talented, warm, and intuitive. The studio vibe is mellow and minimalist. And the 75-minute classes are perfect for getting sweaty on the mat. After a few months of class passes, I was hooked and joined with a monthly membership. I still trek to SaMo occasionally when my schedule allows, but I am happy to call Yoga Salt home.</Review><GmapID>0x80c2ba861f589049:0xb8eaf6487522cd76< /GmapID>< Resp>

Yoga Salt is an incredible studio filled with exceptional teachers. Sesa is a favorite. The studio draws wonderful people who range from casual to serious about their practice , which I find really nice because there's no air of exclusivity or competition.
The studio is always clean and has a wonderful feeling in it. The prices are incredible and inviting.< /review>

This yoga haven has changed my life!  Tamal has created a sacred place that is based on the true premise of yoga. If you want a “authentic” yoga experience  that builds your mental + physical strength this is the place for you. Unlike other Westside studios that have watered down the essence and meaning of yoga - where yoga teachers are instructed to do A, B and C flows.  Yogasalt is not that at all. Each of the teachers have their own style and personality given you a variety of challenges which allows you to learn and grow. A beautiful community of like minded people many have become a second family. Favorite teachers are JJ, Sesa and Nicole and of course Tamal.< /Text>

Class was quite full and I was very displeased to discover they have no showers as a person who is backpacking through California and likes to shower after doing yoga  I probably wouldn't have gone to this studio had I known that other then that the instructor was alright and the people at the front desk were friendly enough< /Review>

< Review>
Drink quality and consistency has, in my opinion, always been a big challenge for Starbucks. So many times I take a sip as I drive away and say, “Yep, they effed that one up.” I try not to order anything difficult, but now it seems like they’re even getting the basic stuff wrong. How do you mess up a hot chocolate? At least the staff are friendly.< /Review>

<Review>All too often we humans are quick to give our opinions if something is unpleasant but not often to commend someone for a job well done. It is rare now days that people enjoy their work...
I had the pleasure of stopping by this location, to be very specific 10am Wed 23 Dec. The line was long, no worries. I was greeted cheerfully and i placed my order. I got up to the window and had a brief yet very pleasant interaction with a friendly, bubbly, blonde moving at 100mph! It's nice to run into someone who enjoys their work, is friendly, and professional. Made my day, a stellar attitude is commendable and much appreciated!</Review></record></dataset><record>

Wonderful experience every time, the baristas always have a fun and positive attitude, going the extra mile to ensure the orders are both satisfying and made correctly. 10/10 would recommend.< /Review>

But in the last 2 months I’ve come here by chance about 5 times.. and 3 of those times my order was wrong and 2 of those 3 times they got my “fixed” order wrong AGAIN to the point that I had to stop them so I didn’t have to waste more time.  Now I get it we all make mistakes but when it’s this consistent it needs to be called out.  I understand they are trying to help everyone as quickly as possible but take an extra 2 seconds to read the order and listen to what a customer is telling you by focusing on them and not being distracted by something else.< /text>< username>

Always out of product (couldn’t even make a simple cloud macchiato from the menu on last visit) and extremely slow creating long lines and wait times. Unfortunately this is the closest Starbucks with a drive-thru near my house. Hopefully management improves ordering and processes soon.<//Review>

<Text>I have been to this Starbucks a few times over the years and I am only making a comment now because of the possible health violations that could come out of it. I just bought a sausage & cheddar breakfast sandwich and it was not fully "warmed up" thankfully I live less than 5 minutes away and microwaved it. I have never had this happen before so I just think management should be aware, I don't think anyone wants to get sick from a simple mistake.</Text>< pics>

Sometimes I eat lunch at Starbucks and buy

included in this lunch box is the

filling.

Starbucks is one of my go to places.< /text>< user>

I ordered on the app. They said it would take about 10 minutes, i get there in 5 minutes and the drinks were already made! The baristas are very kind and help you with any questions. I live in that area so I go there very frequently. Adrian was a great help. He offered choices to lower the caffeine. He was very nice. He asked politely and said thank you and please.</text>

I had a Solo Espresso con Panna the day I visited this Starbucks and enjoyed it. Appears to attract many teens who stay there a long time studying and socializing after school. Napkins were out of stock at the time. A supply truck shipment came as I was ending my visit. Tables were not cleaned during my visit. An associate there informed me that they were short staffed with several people calling out that day.< /Review>

<username>Teresa D<//username><Review>I've visited this location several times, not because it's great but because it's my closest drive through and I'm beginning to wonder if the convenience is worth the aggregation. Aside from their lovely store manager Lane, everyone else here seems to really hate their job and constantly pass that energy down to their customers. Everything from the long wait times at the drive through to the nasty attitudes at the pick up window and the lack of quality in your drinks when the barista is having a bad day.

It truly is unfortunate that it's come to this. Starbucks has always been a place of comfort and comfort is the last thing you feel when you drive away from a place that doesn't fail to leave a bad taste in your mouth.< /Review>< Pics>

Extremely slow drive through service even when inside has only a couple guest. I sat there for quite a while and no one even came up to greet me, take payment or anything. If a manager cared, they should look into it. Actually left without my order and went to McDonalds to get an iced coffee. When I left McDonalds drive-thru the person behind me in the drive-thru was still sitting there!< /Text>

Who is slower, this Starbucks or the McDonalds next door. This Starbucks. The wait at this place is horrible,  super slow. You are better off driving 30 mins away to a Starbucks and coming back here. It will be faster.</Text>

Worse starbucks ever everytime I go they’re missing something I would get if it was once or maybe twice but literally everytime I go they never have what I want which is the mango dragon fruit drink they always say they ran out and even in the morning like if they know they always run out they should get bigger deliveries of it, it’s so unprofessional. To keep your customers happy you should offer a discount or a free drink for not having what the customer wants.</Text>

there are a couple baristas there that are absolute bunfles of sunshine in the morning and I love it. BUT the service is very inconsistent. My order is the same every time I go and it's not very difficult. Trenta Iced Coffee with creamer and a bunch of that caramel drizzle (think caramel macchiato). Some days they get it perfect with no fuss, but some times I've gone THE NEXT MORNING and I've been told by a different barista that "You can't have that much drizzle" and then they'll barely put any caramel drizzle in it, but still charge me for the approx. 8 pumps I'm asking for. Now I know 8 pumps is a lot, but compared to other drinks my order is REALLY easy. If I can order it one day, I should be able to order the exact same thing the next day (unless they're out of something). Management needs to update all employees on what customers can order and what they cannot and stick to it. Instead of it changing day to day depending on your barista. Also like many other complaints, the location is bad so there's no parking and the line for the drive through is always so slow. Put and extra 20min in your morning if you want to go through the drive through.< /review>

Got 10 gift cards the cashier seamed a little overwhelmed kept asking if I could wait for the customer behind me 🙄 I waited for 2 then her machine didn't work, that prints out reciept. U really have to watch too make sure each card is rung up. Or no $$ on the card. She slides the card thru so fast it doesn't have time to register, I caught one. Then she slowed down. But they still make  great drink, try the peppermint mocha no whip on top it's great.</text>

Unfortunately for me, this is the closest Starbucks to where I live. Being that I live right around the street, I visit this location way too often because of location rather than the quality or customer service. That being said, this review will have multiple instances of why YOU should never go here.

The drive thru - if there are 3-4 cars, expect to wait at least 15 minutes in line at the minimum. No sense of urgency at all. If there are more than 5 cars, you're probably looking at 20+ minutes of wait time in a drive through. Don't you dare ask them to throw away something for you to make room for
The drinks you purchased, it's against company policy. (Occurrence - over 10+ times for myself)

Walk in - Usually when I see the 4+ cars, I go inside because I know they have to be faster getting customers in and out (like most Starbucks). Well that is not true, you're looking at a 15+ minute wait if you see a handful of people inside and even longer if it's actually busy. Better yet, 90% of the time they never call your name so you will wait even longer until you get fed up and go ask them about your drink. After which, you can than pick up your nuke warm coffee you no longer want that has been sitting forever. (Occurrence - every single time I have EVER gone in)

Quality - I order the same thing every single time, a Venti Double Dirty Chai Latte. Not once have I ever had it taste the same and very rarely does it taste good like it usually does. (Occurrence - Every single visit)

Customer Service - No one is really friendly or welcoming. They're just trying to do the work and get customers in and out so don't expect the openness of Starbucks employees you usually find elsewhere. (Occurrence - Every single time)

I would suggest getting a coffee at Shell right next to it before I recommend this Starbucks and that's saying a lot in itself.

Have fun waiting!</Text>

<review>Okay so I know in general Starbucks can be busy and that you have to wait... but this particular location was extremely slow and packed. Had to wait well over 10 mins for our drinks, which mind you 2 of the 3 were regular drip coffees. Also ordered a couple of breakfast sandwiches and a pastry, again waited a long time and once called they dropped one of the bfast sandwiches, which fell on the counter... so here we go waiting again to have another made! 20 minutes later and having to ask for our regular drip coffees, we finally made it out of there. Wouldn't go back to this particular location again, thankfully there are plenty of Starbucks locations, IG! 😉</review>< Rate>

This place is disgusting. I'm a loyal Starbucks customer, yet this location is the worst I've ever been too. They make my drink differently every time I order, and this last time I went THERE WAS A FLY IN MY DRINK!!!!!! That's disgusting. I've contacted there customer service multiple times and was hung up on after being placed on hold for over 30mins. This is a terrible establishment and a shame to Starbucks anywhere.<//review>

Nice when I was there, haven't encountered a rude person yet. American was what I expected: smokey, Barista taking my order seemed very tired, but did say have a good day. Didn't put a sleeve on my americano.< /text>

I ordered online and waited over 15 minutes because they made it and kept it behind the counter. No one was even in the front of the resturaunt; there was only one person working the drive through while everyone else seemed to be hiding in the back.< /review>

<rate>1<//rate><review>The drive through takes 20 minutes to go through with only 3 cars. Most of the staff is rude and they don't even make your drinks right (sometimes give you a completely different order). Last time I went there they either made my cold brew with plain iced coffee or it was rancid. I told them it was wrong, but they insisted that it was right and told me to return it somewhere else. So, I returned it to the one on College Blvd. along with another drink that they screwed up.</review>< Pics>

This is by far the worst starbucks I've ever been to. I live down the street and frequent here on and off. On because I get up early and think it's not gonna be like last time, and off because it's always like last time. first off they never make the drinks the way that the rest of the starbucks in San Diego do. Then if you try to tell them the way you want it spicifically when you order it, its still wrong. I will no longer spend any of my money here, today was the last time. They need to retrain the staff and stick to the recipe.<//text>

This is a fairly busy location, but there's usually plenty of indoor and patio seating. Plus it has convenient plugs for devices.<//review>

Adrian was totally rude as soon as I walked in I ask a question and all he had was attitude and it after that kept looking at me rude and very unfriendly but the rest of the staff is incredible and drinks are great as usual it’s just the one employee that left a sour taste in my mouth< /review>

If you want a drink in less than 20 minutes do not go through the drive through but this is the case at all Starbucks. People assume that because they don't have to get out of there car it's going to somehow be faster but that's just not the case. Staff is usually friendly sometimes neutral but never anything less than that.<//Text>

Yesterday was the first time in this magnificent restaurant. But It is absolutely not the last. We passed a splendid evening with the attentive service, with the fine  cuisine and wine and with the modest charge. We will no doubt go back there soon.<//Text>

<Response>None< /Response><UserId.>104883668006915372147</UserId.><name>Peggy Fung< /name><text>4 STAR. Overall. Would return but gotta make sure to specify no MSG otherwise it's just on par with other cantonese restaurants. Love the refillable complimentary free soup though. Not your average cheap free soup. My 7 year old had 2 bowls of that, paired with rice, and called it a meal. Generous portion at an average of $8 to $10 per plate to share. Ordered about one dish per person to share and still have plenty to take home.

Other: On the salty side in general. Some dishes are pre-MSG-ed. Avoid where makes sense. Fast service. Wouldn't be opposed to dine here if chosen by my group of friends. Just double emphasize the no MSG. Newly opened less than a month ago, doing well so far. Let’s hope they keep this up and not deteriorate in quality and portion as is the trend with new Chinese restaurants.</text><Gmap_id>0x80c2d53abcd4a67f:0x483ef2ffc1f48a57<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

roast duck is great, and chefs behind vending glass always smile. Like it! Next time will upload photo with Chef if I got a time to pick up the "always four meals" order<//review>

Good food. We ate the spicy salt pork chops which was amazing! The kung Pao shrimp was super good too. They have fast food available or you can sit down and order from the menu. Rated a 4 because no air conditioning.</Review>

(Translated by Google) The characteristic of this restaurant is that it opens early, and you can go to work at 8 o'clock in the morning. In addition, you can buy a bento and eat lunch at the company in the afternoon, which is very convenient. 👍

這家餐館的特點就是早開門，早上八點鐘就可以去吃個早餐再去上班。另外還可以買個便當，下午在公司吃便當，太方便了。👍<//Review>

The man that rented me the car was rude. He was dismissive and acted like I was interrupting him both when I called AND came in to pick up the car. The oil light went on as soon as I got to my destination. I called the company and they said they would send out the roadside service. So while I am on my vacation and at my Airbnb, I am supposed to wait for them. Absolutely ridiculous. You mean to tell me that they don't check the oil level in their rental cars? This is basic maintenance.  I will never rent from them again.< /text>

The location at crown valley has been the worst experience renting a car.   The office smells of heavy middle eastern spices. The car smelled like the office, no windshield wiper fluid. It took me an hour to vacuum out the sand. When I expressed my disappointment she was rude. I’m a professional and this was so far below my experience at other rental places. Zero stars here. Avoid it all cost.   Warmly yours Dr. Chet< /text>

If you rent, it will be a guaranteed headache. The cars are disgustingly dirty where you will need to take them to a car wash yourself upon pick-up. One rental actually had blood drops and someone's COVID-19 vaccination paperwork in it. I have picked up cars where the seats are covered in deodorant, human and pet hair, dirt, sand, smells, stains, dents, scratches, missing door handle panels, NO WINDSHIELD WASHER FLUID (3 rentals), needed "maintenance" and an "oil change," you name it. Most times, the locations close early, before your rental is due. They may give you the courtesy of asking you to return before your contracted, paid time, so they actually shorten your rental time, for their personal benefit. The only reason their prices are lower are because they are franchises. Pay the few extra dollars and rent from only airport locations. They have CLEAN cars that you paid for, not an unwanted upgrade, because they failed to properly clean the vehicles. The airport locations are better equipped to handle grievances where these franchised locations have their own rules. Airport car rental employees highly advise the same.

No, this was not "one bad rental," this is a recurring issue with the Crown Valley and Lake Forest locations. Feel free to steer towards the positive reviews, as I had done, but you will be setting yourself up for a problem.<//Review><response>None<//response>< UserId.>

The gentleman at the counter was very nice but the rest of the experience was disappointing. 1: they tried overcharging me. I had to pull up my receipt and then he had to take a picture of it and send to his manager. had to wait around for her to approve it. It still was off slightly, but I didn't have time to deal with it at that point. 2: the car was pretty beat up and reeked of cigarettes. I was told that was the only car available so I had no choice<//Review>

Misleading information. Charged a whole day fare for picking up the car 1 hour early after getting the okay from the employee and returning it on time as specified on the contract. Employees do not seem to care about customer satisfaction nor do they convey accurate information about the rental.  I also had to wait 45+ minutes for the employee to SHOW UP to process my rental. Unacceptable.

Will never use this location again. Previous experiences with Avis have been fine. This location has been a terrible experience.<//Text>

<review>Horrible customer service from the employees at Avis Lake Forest branch. I was accused of directly smoking inside the vehicle, whereas I never had done so, also being harrassed by such employees, trying to apply every type charge to this rental, I personally will not tolerate any such level of outlandish behavior and customer service as a whole.<//review><user>110979293395361282744< /user><username>Derek Moore< /username></record>

I've rented from this location many times over the last 5 years. I've always received a great rate for the car (and yes, I've double checked other companies). The staff is friendly and has always taken good care of us. Even if we had an issue they took care of the problem to our satisfaction.<//review>

Checkin and checkout were quick. We called 2 days ahead to verify what we would get and they told us a ford edge or ford explorer. When we got there, they offered us a minivan. They said the explorer out from was spoken for the day before which is 1 day after we called. Kind of a joke on which car you will get.< /Text>

The representative greeted me and helped me right away - showed the available cars and helped me chose the right one for me. Did the paper works and explained the details. When I returned the car he checked the car and followed up with a repeat business whenever I need  a rental car. A very positive experience!< /text>

<Text>Terrible experience... I will never use Avis anymore. I usually use Enterprise. However I tried this one because of lower prices. Biggest mistake ever. I would rather pay a little bit more and have a good experience then deal with a cheap rip off company. That is only out to screw people over. Not a good experience at all. I've never once had a bad experience with Enterprise. This guy that works at this place is a liar and not friendly at all. Very frustrating as a mom with two kids.. Never will use them again.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

The level of service, make, model and price of rental was awesome. I was also pleased with the lack of restrictions (You can drive rental in all lower 48 states) Josh Mastow's customer service was exceptional. Tip- if you have a Costco membership book through Costco and save more $$$.<//review>

Bassem helped my wife and me out with some 'Technical Difficulties' we were having with the online platform and the 'Customer Service' we were getting on the phone.  He was able to fix it there in his branch office and we could not be happier!<//Text>

<rate>5</rate><text>Low hassle, excellent customer service at the Lake Forest Avis. Out of there in less than 10 minutes. Good rates. Had such a negative customer service experience at Enterprise in Mission Viejo that I canceled my reservation and went to Avis. Avis is now my go to rental car place. Car wasn't washed, but it was a new vehicle with 20,000 mls. I can live with a little dust when I am treated well.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>Choose because affiliated with aarp. Paid for rental in advance, advised at check in the card i presented not accepted for the $100 deposit. Keep in mind this os the same card i used to pay for the rental. So, i spent $40 on lyft, wasted my time and had to cancel my plans because OF AVIS' deceptive policy.</Text>< Pics>

Renting cars can sometimes be a pain because of the lengthy waiting process. That is not a problem at this branch. You can easily walk out with keys within 5 to 10 minutes, assuming you made a reservation. The clerk doesn't even walk out to perform a pre-trip inspection or hard-sell you on unnecessary insurance. Just exchange DL and CC info for the keys and you're on your way.< /text>

<rate>5< /rate><text>I got a 3 day pass to try it out and it was a great experience.  I been a member at 24 but my membership is about to end and I wanted to try somewhere else. I’m ready to purchase the all access membership at planet fitness because the gym works for me, they have a lot of room to do your own workout which is something that I like doing. Customer service is great. Young adults working there but they’re very nice and mature which is something I liked. I wish they had foam rollers and box jumps in the gym, but no complaint I can just bring my own foam roller and use something else to jump. I loved their concept of  No judgment gym and I really feel the great there. You see a lot of people different shapes and nobody judging or acting weird  for having a great fitness body. This gym makes me feel good about myself where I can be who I am showing off my extra pounds with no pressure from other people working out  having a goal in mind to be stronger with a better shape and healthier. They also offer the message beds and chairs and something else for your skin. They have plenty of lockers, showers, and free candy 🍬 haha . Thanks planet fitness!< /text>< pics>

This place is great open 24/7 now ! Make sure to ask for *Emily* she was really knowledgeable about all of the prices, programs , offers etc. She was quick and did not waste my time. Really good offers right now but I'm not sure I'd it's always this cheap or if it's because they just opened.<//Review>

The place is nice and new, however, it is kinda small still bigger than fitness 19 which is the closest competing gym.
The parking lot is also small and fills up fairly quickly.<//Text>

<Review>It’s a good gym, the only think that it a bit annoying Is that they play Fox News and it’s just on the TVs.       Politics should stay out of the gym.     No fox or cnn.  Play sports or movies.  Just saying< /Review>< Rate>

<Text>Raley's in Natomas off Del Paso Blvd was well stocked for mother days and I enjoyed my shopping experience until checkout time, the lady (with blue dreds) was extremely rude almost frightening. I always bring my own grocery bags but she seemed angry at that and proceeded to hurl my items into the cart where I was directed to bag them, if it was such a big problem I was willing to use Raley's bags and let their assistant do it. However I said nothing.....
I spent almost $200 dollars there and no thank you or good bye. Not sure what's going on there but probably won't be back to this particular Raley's.< /Text><user>108529370077372075631<//user>< GmapID>

Little pricy, but not too bad. Nice staff, pleasant customers (due to prices). Stress free shopping is what you can expect from this place. We like their rib-eye steaks - they are delicious and always fresh. Convenient location.<//review>< user>

When I shop in store, the staff is always helpful and kind. They do a great job with sanitizing between customers. They usually offer to help me to my car when they see me tugging around my toddler.

I've absolutely love their E-cart service. The staff is quick, and notify me right away if something is out of stock. They usually always offer substitutions of similar quality. They are always pleasant and are quick to bring the order out when I arrive. Once they forgot an item, and they fixed it right away by issuing a refund when I called in.< /review>

<rate>1<//rate><review>I came at 8:30 to get my wife flowers. I got 2 bouquets and asked one employee if he can call someone to help me make 1 bouquet out of 2. He went and asked, came back and said the person that works in that department went home already. That's understandable, whatever!  But there were 5 employees standing around and it wasn't busy when I was there. 5 people standing around and nobody can wrap some flowers.

<review>I have always had an great experience with Raley’s! Recently I started using their e cart service and it’s such an easy and efficient way to shop! They keep me updated with something they don’t have and the substitution they do! I have also gotten delivery done by them, they keep you informed throughout the whole process with out giving any troubles.</review><pics>None<//pics>< GmapID>

This is one of the grocery stores that I frequent. The other ones that I frequent are in the Bel air brand, so they're a bit fancier and have more stuff. However, this really is one of the better grocery stores in North natomas. I love shopping here for groceries or for deli items and I know that a lot of my neighbors like to stop and get coffee when they're out for a morning walk. Overall 4 out of 5 stars because it's a mainstay of my community.< /Text>

Locally owned business. I've been shopping at this store for 16 years and still don't know who the manager is. So now I also frequent Safeway and Sprouts to get products they don't have at Raleys.<//text>

< Review>
I love Raley's and when I go right before closing most times I never feel rushed and they are very friendly. The staff is respectful and has great customer service. Also their prepared meals are pretty good...some of them. I have tasted some that are not so great. I guess the only addition I would suggest is more varieties.</Review>

Glad I stopped in a nice store with better quality bakery and hot prepared foods. I live just around the corner from a BerAir market and this is much better. Would have rated higher but I stopped in for 3 items and they only had half of what I came for. I know the whole covid thing but these were basic items<//text>

<Review>So I've  always loved and today I went shopping so happy to buy at the deli  they sell mortadella it's good so like many people I ended up buying a few items in my basket counted 14  so eent to the 15 items or less on the right end of the check out but there was a customer with a full cart paying so I moved to the left end of it. As I approached the register I was told by cindy only 15 items so I said ok decided to do a recount 15. So I placed my first item on the counter and cindy said again  15 items only so i said ok but she kept starring at me a few times so i decided to do the self check out so dissatisfied with the way she kept looking at my basket and my eyes  1 2 3 5 items later I decided not to patronize my favorite store nit today at least apologized to the lady attending and asked her to please put them back no shopping here didn't welcome welcome remarks I've been a customer for over 26 years< /Review>< pics>

I used to shop at raley's in mountain view, which was an excellent upscale market. This one is pretty mediocre. I find the entrances inconvenient for Handicapped parking, and they've made it worse with restrictions on use of the entrance I liked. The produce is nothing special, and I once bought a roast that was way past its prime and incredible.  I rarely shop here.</Review>

It's been almost 3 months and the soda fountain machine has not been fixed also there is no cold sodas available anywhere in the store, except for a few Pepsi bottles in the energy drink area in front of the soda fountain machine. I usually have to go to the gas station for a fountain soda. I have to make two stops to have some breakfast. A store of this caliber should be able to fix basic issues sooner. Thanks!</Text>

<rate>1< /rate><Pics>None<//Pics><Review>This review is based solely on their deli & hot food items. If you work in the shopping center then the hot food might be a affordable lunch break pit stop, but nearly every time I come through for hot food, everything looks like a deserted buffet. The staff seem to make no effort what so ever to stir items once in a while to preserve the natural moisture or even attempt to display attractive items. Almost every hot food item on display looks like it's been under a heat lamp for several hours. Not recommended<//Review><userid>109068582267244934743<//userid>< resp>

<text>The lines here are always pretty short and if longer move fast. Sometimes the people in the parking lot can be sketchy so be aware if you go late at night. The store is clean and staff is helpful. The Ecart service here is really slow and they have forgot my items a couple of times. They will deliver it to your home but it is still annoying.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

It's what one would expect of a Raleys. It has numerous grocery items of fairly good quality. Most imposing, however, is the huge pharmacy section of the store.</Text>

Good dance music! The staff is great. The store is clean and well managed.  Some stuff is painfully overpriced compared to places like walmart etc. I also wish they carried more Asian, Indian, foods/seasonings.< /review>

Great grocery store! Pretty great options if you're looking for dairy-free and/or gluten-free options. Also pretty great service, but the people bagging groceries need to work on making bags balanced and not too heavy so they break. They just need training<//Text>

I work in Natomas and hate leaving for lunch.  However I don't mind stopping here for lunch.  There is a variety of choices and you can get in and out pretty quickly.  This last time I tried some Chinese food, however I think the pork and chicken was held in the warmer too long.  It looked AMAZING but when I was eating it there were some very hard pieces.  And the chow mein was dry.  The flavor was good.< /review>

Cakes are moist and not exceedingly sweet. I know coz I always buy their round cakes for my company’s bday events (only for 16 people so I don’t need a sheet cake). They are always happy to write words on the cake for you. Solid meat and produce departments. They also have a postal service counter, open on Saturdays. This is genuinely a huge plus!!

Of course, there is Foods Co or Walmart Grocery. But Raleys and Bel Air are my default grocery stores!</Review></record>

<text>This store has a friendly, helpful staff and large variety of selections. The layout makes it a little difficult to shop quickly, but the aisles are generally fairly wide. The shopping carts actually roll unlike some stores in the area. There are several different businesses in this shopping center so parking can be tricky.</text>< Gmap_id>

This is a great grocery store. I'm part of the rewards program called Something Extra and I receive discounts in the mail. These discounts are rewards based on how much you spend at the store. I primarily shop at Raley's so when I received a $9 off any purchase coupon I felt appreciated. FYI the people working in the meat department are super helpful  and friendly!</Review>

If you like to wait 20 minutes and paying high prices  at checkout both at their pharmacy and checkout lanes then this store is for you.

On average only two cash registers with an actual employee are open.</Review>

Best grocery store as far as customer service is concerned. The staff does a great job assisting my 88 year old father. He maintains his independence but can get the help he needs shopping. I'm still getting used to the store layout. Meat and produce are high quality. Pricier than most stores.</text>

<review>Huge store with a good selection. Still, they don't carry the vegan salad dressing I like but, oh well! What I really love about this store is that they are the only place in the area that carries block ice, which I frequently use. It's rather spendy but at least they make it available. Service is usually pretty good here, though the lines can be bad at times. Parking is the worst thing about this store, which they don't have much control over. I wish there were a few more handicap spots closer to the doors. It can be hard to park at the end of the parking lot and make it all the way up to the store. That is mostly what I removed one star for.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Lupe and others at Raley's have always been a pleasure to see.  We have been shopping there since the store opened.  it's part of our community and people usually greet others with a smile and good words.  It was nice to see a group of young new employees being trained one day then a couple weeks later one young woman greeted me with a huge grin.  Makes me feel good to see people who work there. The store is clean without funky smells.  It's our "go to" place for grocery shopping and mailing.< /text>

Quality product all around. Poor customer service. It’s best to know what you want or research it before going in the store than asking for help. At the register, the bagger and cashier are joking and giggling amongst themselves too busy to help with any questions other than bagging and collecting the money..<//Review>

<review>The Raley's in Natomos is probably the worst Raley's I have been in to date. It feels dirty, shelves are often bare, products don't seem to be rotated, and the workers seem miserable. I have been really disappointed since in Chico and Redding, Raley's is one of the best super markets in town.</review>< Pictures>

< Review>
I have been going here since I was a child, however, even as an adult, I do nearly all of my shopping at this particular location, as it is both very high quality as well as convenient to my home.

The quality of the fruits, vegetables, and meats is unbeatable in the area, which are my must-haves for a grocery store, so this is the perfect store for me.

I often do my shopping around the same times, and the staff is super friendly, and most of them have gotten familiar enough to know me either by name or at least by face. Even the new staff is very friendly as well!

Be sure to become a member of their "Something Extra" rewards program. They will send you extra coupons via email, and also coupons as well as a cash voucher for a percentage of the amount of money you spend their each quarter. For me this is a big deal, as they are often personalized for the items that I actually buy there, rather than random coupons that might come in the mail.

Their prices for everyday items can at times be a littler higher. I actually don't mind this too much, as the quality of their perishable items is so high, the store is always clean, and I never have trouble finding things, that I have no need to shop anywhere else!</Review>

I've been a regular customer over six years and have been able to find everything that I  needed except only one thing (All Season).  Now Raley's do carry ALL Season Salt.< /review>

<Text>I had to pickup some yogurt and tapioca pudding for my Dad. I also bought a 20 pack of Diet Pepsi. This store was confusing at first, when my parents moved to North Natomas. Now everything is laid out in sections and it's very easy to get what you need. The employees are very helpful, friendly and answers any questions I might have. If you can't find what you're looking for, the employees will walk you over to where it is. The store can be very busy, but they drop everything to help me. I am very impressed with the customer service I receive everytime I am there.</Text>< response>

This store is huge. It has a wholefood and organic area; an awesome line of fresh produce; a wide selection of beverages; and a great hot and cold deli that's great when you need a quick breakfast,  lunch,  or dinner.</Review>

The only store I want to buy spinach to make salads at. Always fresh and last at least seven days. Another bonus of getting spinach at Raley's is that it's always only $5.</text>

< Review>
Very disappointed in Raleys deli in their hot food section. IT WAS A Wreck!! It looked like. Thee food didn’t even look like it was fit to eat. Very Messy and the food didn’t look fresh. The food looked like he had been there for a long time. Didn’t look appetizing at all. Macaroni every where PUKE!</Review>

<review>I just have to write this review to express how amazing Raley's in the Natomas location is. Especially the Peet's Coffee crew and of course the Bakery department. I work at Great Clips in the shopping center and frequently visit Raley's. Thank you to Matt, Terry, Michelle, Angelica, Mary and whoever else I forgot to mention. Because they are all amazing.

This reveiw is so important to me for the upper management to see. Because my Son and I lives have been changed because of their kindness.

My Son is 20 years old and has a disability called 48xxyy Syndrome. We come to Raley's and Peet's Coffee on my days off for our weekly routine "lunch date" Leo looks forward to this every week, to visit "the guys". We grab coffee and lunch and eat in the deli area. It's always a good time. We small talk with them and leave full and happy. This being a huge accomplishment being that Leo isn't always the easiest guy to get along with.

April 1st was Leo's Birthday. I told the guys we would be coming in as usual. Not expecting anything but to hang out a little on Leo's Birthday. Well Matt went above and beyond. We arrived and Michelle told me that Matt had Angelica make Leo a cake. Such an awesome idea. So thoughtful and brought tears to my eyes. When he got back from lunch we all surprised Leo and sang him Happy Birthday. Leo felt so special. What a great feeling for a Mom!!

It makes me still beleive in people and kindness. To think of my Son on his birthday like that is so thoughtful. To make my special Son, Leo feel so happy. He loves you guys. Best beleive we will continue our "lunch dates".  The best part is Leo wouldn't eat his cake at home. He said "it's made with too much love, Mom" and that's how I know he was thankful.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I believe the store is a bit pricey and their deli food that is pre-cooked is only fair.  I am very uni9by their deli.  It is edible but that is all I can say about it.  The people in this Raleys are exceptionally nice.  A young lady that was getting the carts in the parking lot when I dropped my keys today.  I am not able to bend without severe pain.  She was about 20 feet away and noticed that I had dropped them and volunteered to pick them up for me without being asked.  I do not appear disabled or in my late sixties.  I truly wish I could remember her name but as with all of us, short term memory occassionally eludes me.  It is so nice to see a wonderful young woman in today's world.</Text>

RALEYS WIL ALWAYS RECEIVE NOTHING BUT RAVE REVIEWS FROM US. Though yeah sometimes the prices can be $$$, the cleanliness and willingness of the staff to help you with everything from finding obscure items to recipe help. Love Raleys!< /text>

I shop here regularly and usually don't have a problem.  However the produce section has been trending horrible the last 6 weeks or so.  I bought a bag of tangerines and 2 of them were moldy.  A bag of navel oranges, 1 smashed and moldy.  A bag of chopped salad mix that was brown after 2 days.  The Florist is a nice eye treat if you use the northern entrance.< /Text>

< Review>
Food court is good but it is best to go there during lunch and early evening as it all starts getting old. Not a great selection of items, what store doesn't carry cold eez or zicam, no medicated lip balm, but I did find my alka-seltzer plus cold and flu.. Prices were a bit higher than Safeway in same items but again they have different selection of items, found my favorite bbq sauce there and my favorite brown bread...</Review>

Their "fully cooked" chicken meatballs are raw! The dried white beans cause gas. Everything else seems OK.< /text>

< Review>
I like to go to the Pete's coffee shop thats inside Raleys before work. They are always nice and cheerful to make my coffee.
Raleys has always been one of my favorite local grocery shops. They recently just put out a basket of fruit so children who are shopping with their mothers can have a healthy snack while they shop.
Very personal favorite to get at raleys besides groceries is their sandwiches in the Deli section.< /Review>

< Review>
Had to go in on New Year's Eve to pick up some last minute items and while the store was extremely busy, they had 13 registers (out of 14) open serving customers.  Was surprised that I got in and out so quickly.

Every employee that I have encountered at this Raley's has been extremely courteous and helpful.

My only wish was WiFi was available while I shop and in the Peet's Coffee area so I can grab a beverage and get online.

UPDATE: They did add WiFi to the store so you can use WiFi while you shop or just relax in the cafe with a beverage.< /Review>

Just spent twelve bucks on old dry cold food and purchased a fiji water that was in an entire row of mislabeled waters. This was such a terrible lunch and a total waste of time. It's middle school cafeteria quality and overpriced.
Do not bother!!<//Text>

Clean store with friendly employees.  More expensive than some other stores but as long as you don't mind shopping the weekly ad, good deals can still be found.</Text>

Very rude manager and staff is condescending in attitude
Place is disorganized
I think they are looking for a specific class of customer
I may not fit into their expectation of what a customer should look like in appearance
