My teeth were cleaned and the people there were very nice. Props to Thuy who did a very thorough job on my cleaning. I was kinda nervous at first but was almost falling asleep during the cleaning because of how gentle it was.</review>

So my experience with them started way before my visit to the office. The staff there made me feel like I was a priority even over the phone. Then when I went to my office visit the environment was so different from a normal visit to a dentist. It was really fun. They were very informative and walked me through everything that they were doing and made sure that I had a good understanding. Really great and very friendly.</review>

Just started going here a couple months ago and have been extremely happy with everyone at the office.  I’m an extremely anxious person when it comes to the dentist but I immediately felt comfortable here at this office.  I have taken all 4 of my boys here and they all have felt comfortable going there.  A couple of them have had to get some pretty major work done too. I highly recommend them!<//Review>

Great Dental Office. Erin the Hygienist does a thorough job when deep cleaning. You can tell she really cares about her craft and goes above and beyond. Makes the experience easy going and smooth always checking in with me. From Erin to the dental assistants to Dr Khouri everybody is friendly and create a comfy environment. You wont regret coming here!<//Text>

I travel for my job and I have to say this is the best dentist office I’ve ever found. Everyone in the clinic is super friendly. The dental hygienists are all so good. I also had a filling done. The Dr was so patient and the process was a breeze. I like that people are kind and not pushy to get you do anything unnecessary. For example, when I declined X-ray, they were really chill about it. Highly recommend this dental office to everyone in the San Jose area!<//text>

My last visit was to get my invisalign put in.  The procedure went very well.  It is day 4 today, and my mouth has adjusted to the invisalign in my mouth.
Overall, my prior experiences have been nice.  The staff and doctor are personable, knowledgeable, and patient.  The waits have been minimal, which I really appreciate.

Thank you!<//Review>

My brother referred me to Dr. Woodlief  and my family and I could not be happier with our treatment.  From cleanings to extractions, we have been impressed with the knowledge and professionalism of Dr. Woodlief and his staff.  We look forward to having them help with my sons orthodontia and any other future services.  As great as a trip to the dentist can get!  Highly recommend!<//Text>

I'm relatively new to this office: about a year. After having a root canal & crown, plus 2 cleanings, I'm very happy with Dr Michelle G. Khouri, DDS and the dental Hygienist (Erin?), I'm asking my wife and my daughter to transfer to this office as well.< /review>

I’m highly impressed with the professionalism and care Dr. Khouri and her team have taken with me and my visit! The dental hygienist was extra attentive to my sensitivity and made sure I was comfortable throughout the whole cleaning!! I need a replacement crown and a brand new one on another tooth and just like with most people, I’m not a fan with needing any dental work done so I’m dreading these visits, but it has to get done! Dr. Khouri was very personable and made me feel right at ease with my new crown. I have my next appointment for my replacement crown in Jan and I’m actually looking forward to it! I can’t thank the team enough for easing my worries and fears about the dentist! Highly recommend them for anyone in north San Jose or Milpitas looking for a new dentist!!< /Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>We couldn’t be more happy with Dr Woodlief and his staff. From the first consult to all stages of appliances and braces, Dr. Woodlief takes the time to explain everything thoroughly. We really appreciated that it’s not just about the cosmetics but also about function. He’s very concerned about preventing issues like TMJ. He’s constantly learning about the latest methods and techniques and is extremely knowledgeable. We live in Hollister but it was well worth the drive to San Jose for office visits. My daughter got her braces off in December and her smile is gorgeous.
We recommended my sister take her daughter to Dr. Woodlief because she has a cleft palate and that creates complications. They live in Fresno but make the long drive to see Dr. Woodlief because they trust that he will give her the best possible care. They are so happy with how he’s taking care of my niece that they started treatment with her younger brother also . We are all very happy with the care he’s provided our family!!<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Review>I came to see Dr. Woodlief for my tmj problem. Having been very satisfied with the treatment he  provided our whole family moved here for our dental needs. We are in the process of getting invisalign for both our kids. We feel we are in safe hands as Dr. Woodlief is so caring and his moral compass is always oriented in the right direction. Meaning, he will never suggest any treatment that will not be in the patient’s best interests. Hygienist Erin is so so sweet and her cleaning is just like a spa treatment. They have a room with TV which my kids love. Dr. Khouri did a filling for my kid and that went fairly smooth too. Overall five stars and more!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Dr.Woodlief and his team are professional and safety conscious. They have put many safety measures in place to help battle the current health issues that the world is facing.  We felt very comfortable and safe going there. I highly recommend Dr. Woodlief.<//review>

I have been a patient of Dr. Woodlief for many years. I began coming to Advanced Dentistry because of pain in my TMJ. He was able to work with me and the pain was resolved for good. He was the orthodontist I chose when my daughter needed braces, because I didn't want her to have the same TMJ problems that I did. The doctor is currently treating me for sleep apnea. This required an expansion of the bone structure in my mouth and Invisalign to straighten and correct my bite. We are still working toward that goal. The office staff is very helpful and I have enjoyed working with them.< /Text>

I have been a patient of Dr. Woodlief for twenty years. He has provided me with excellent care. He is very thorough and conscientious in his work. He is very patient and always willing to take the time necessary to answer any questions and explain treatment options. His staff is equally courteous  and friendly.</Text>

Dr. Woodlief and his team are such a blessing to me. They know my name the second I walk in the door and greet me with a smile. They make you feel right at home

Dr. Woodlief really cares about his patients. He took the time to explain in detail what was going on in my jaw and answer any questions patiently and completely. His medical models really helped me visualize what was going on too.

My treatment is not complete but I can open my mouth and move my jaw side to side much farther than before. We have "captured" the disk that had become displaced to stop me from grinding my jaw bone away. The nutrient shots in the joint are a blessed relief and I can fall asleep with less pain.

The process of getting better takes time, but now I have real hope to get back to a pain free normal state. I have suffered with this problem many, many years.

You and your wonderful team are an oasis in a world of hate and chaos. I am so hopeful...and grateful!!!<//review>

I found Advanced Dentistry on google and the reviews were too good to be true. I wanted to get a 2nd opinion on my proposed teeth alingment treatment. I was thoroughly impressed with the non-pushy attitude of the staff and competitive pricing and I enrolled for the program. I am 3 months into the Invisalign treatment and seeing great results already. Well deserved 5*.

Dr Khouri is my specialist and big kudos to her for replying to my emails promptly and in details.< /Review>

Both I and my 4 year old daughter really like going to the dentist now that we have found Dr. Khouri. That says a lot because we had to go in nearly every week when we first got the ALF orthodontics in—we were not used to cleaning around them and cutting up hard foods, so they would come loose.

Everyone in the office is very professional, caring and kind. I appreciate that Dr. Khouri talks with my daughter and makes her comfortable with the work being done. I am really glad we found this practice.</text>

Dr. Woodlief is very professional, friendly and is on the cutting edge of dental knowledge. He and his office have been very flexible and accommodating, concerning appointment times and dates to schedule me in: being that I live out of state. The appliance that he has installed has been easy to maintain/adjust, and if I have any questions I can schedule a phone appointment with him. His staff has been very helpful and most often has the answer to most anything. I appreciate his willingness to be attentive to what a patient needs.</Text>

Dr. Woodlief and his staff are knowledgeable, caring, and patient.  His techniques help in difficult mouth, teeth, and jaw disorders, and you learn things you never knew before. He uses the MLS laser which has helped reduce pain in many of my joints.

<text>I have been going to Dr Woodlief for about two years.  For years I used to suffer from TMJ pain which also triggered migraines.  I had visited doctors who prescribed me ibuprofen and sent me on my way.  I researched and found Dr Woodlief and I cannot emphasize enough that he has changed the way I live.    He and his staff are methodical in the way they assess your specific condition.  For me, they measured my jaw and used the latest 3D technology to take a picture of my mouth to get the right mouth guard.  I no longer suffer from TMJ pain or migraines.

I recently had to return to Dr Woodlief because I aggravated my jaw while eating, which can happen. I went to Dr Woodlief for pain management where he used a latest technology laser.   The laser triggered my pain points that helped to relieve the pain.  It has been one week since the treatment and I have not had pain or discomfort.

There are doctors, then there are doctors that care.  Dr Woodlief is in the caring category hands down.</text>< pics>

I love this place. Everyone was very helpful and courteous.  Erin the hygienist is very professional because she took the time to her my needs and concerns and took the time to perform her job. The dentist was very professional and understanding.  She took the time to explain my options for my dental treatment. Thanks to everyone.<//review>

< Review>
I've been coming here for a few years now and have always had a positive experience.  Dr. Woodlief and Dr. Khouri do great work, as does Erin, who does all my dental cleaning. Jaylyn and the rest of the office staff are always welcoming and always keep me updated on my upcoming visits.  I would highly recommend this office to anyone in the area looking for a good dental team.</Review>

< Review>
We have been going to Dr Woodlief for over 20 years and recommend him without reservation. I have had way more than the average amount of dental work and my teeth are a bit of a special case.  He has given me nothing but the best care and dental advice and is always up on the very latest technology and advancements in dental care (and health care for that matter). He is one of the nicest and most caring dentists I have ever gone to and puts his patients first 100% of the time.<//Review>

<Review>Dr. Woodlief is a great & understanding doctor with treatments that work and a real enthusiasm for his work. He does his research and has a great network of doctors in case you need to be referred for anything. I found an amazing chiropractor & oral surgeon thanks to him. The DNA device has changed my facial structure for the better, and my breathing has improved significantly.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x808fcdae74a55373:0x812ff28d328544c8<//Gmap_id></record>

Deft and dexterous, and a warm and calming “chair side” manner for my 10 year old son. Dr. Woodlief displays great skill and eagerness to advance his practice with proven innovations in dental care.  A great find for our family.<//Review>

“Don’t expect solutions for your problem “
These are the words I heard before I met Dr Woodlief!!
I had a TMJ problem where I stopped eating outside as I cannot open my mouth to fit the food in it, not talking about the ability to chew when my jaw locks up.
Dr Woodlief promised me to get this fixed in a year and a lag, and by God’s Grace I am done, back to my normal life, with snore free nights as a bonus :)
I am grateful for such a dedicated, respectful, and understanding doctor.
He is also surrounded with the nicest staff and assistants.
It was a pleasure knowing you all.
If you ever think that you have no hope with your TMJ.. think again and schedule an appointment with dr Woodlief 👍👍👍👍👍</text>< pics>

You bet I would recommend Dr Woodlief and most certainly Dr Khouri! I have been dealing with horrible headaches, jaw pain,and neck pain from tmj. My teeth were extremely worn down from grinding and clenching so much. I finally, after alot of thought, decided to have a full mouth reconstruction done. I was scared, and wasn't sure about what I was getting into. Well today I have a mouth full of beautiful, brand new porcelain crowns, and I can't stop smiling! Dr Khouri the work you have done is Outstanding! Dr Khouri did an amazing job keeping me out of pain that I was falling asleep in the dental chair on my visits. Dr. Khouri is extremely confident in what she does, so it made me feel confident and trusting in what she does. I also enjoyed going to my appointments because we had some real good laughs and talks. Today my teeth are free from pain and my debilitating headaches have lessened big time. No more Jaw Pain either! Dr. Khouri you have made me a happier person today because of the hard, beautiful work that you have done to my mouth, teeth. You all are very friendly, and caring here and you made me feel totally comfortable. SMILING!<//review>

< review>
Both Dr Woodlief and Khouri are patient, informative and kind. Dr Woodlief's specialty is TMJ disorder/ craniofacial therapy/ sleep disorders (to name a few) and he's been my specialist for years. He truly cares for his patients and has gone out of his way for me many times with advice/teaching and recommendations-- even when i had some insurance changes. Dr Khouri has performed 3 dental procedures on me now, all of which have been comfortable (considering the nature of procedures). Her teaching is always good- describes risks, benefits and possible outcomes. Support staff are also kind, good and efficient-- what more can you ask for? Shout out to Erin, she's one of the best dental hygienists I've ever been to-- she's taught me so much! Tip: Erin is busy she takes her time and is thorough, book early if you want an appt with her.< /review>

Everything was explained to me regarding my teeth thouroughly and I feel like I was taken cared of really well. People here are very friendly, accommodating and really informative. The cleaning that I had with Erin was great too, she really took her time to make sure that I got the best service. The dentist was really kind and corteous as well. Will definitely recommend them to everyone :)<//review>

<Review>I have been afraid of the dentist since forever but my experience with Dr. Woodlief and his staff has been wonderful. Dr. Woodlief spends his time explaining procedures and options. He stays up to date with all the latest dental advancements and is knowledgeable and experienced.  He doesn’t push expensive procedures and is kind and patient. My family trusts him and we don’t dread going to the dentist a more. His office staff is excellent. Jaylyn manages communication and scheduling and does an excellent job. Erin has been our hygienist for years and we have learned so much from her... she has probably saved us from some future dental procedures. My family and I highly recommend Dr. Woodlief and his staff!<//Review>< pictures>

FANTASTIC!  Dr. Khouri was very informative of her treatment plan, called in the evening to check on her new patient and was so gentle!  I would highly recommend this dental group to my patients.  Well done!</Review>

I love Dr. Woodlief and his staff! He is incredibly knowledgable and helped me with my vertigo and TMJ! I can finally sleep breathing through my nose instead of being a mouth breather which has helped my vertigo. His staff are wonderful, very accommodating and polite. They always make me feel welcome!< /Review>

<Review>I am glad that a friend referred me to Dr. Woodlief's office. Dr. Michelle Khouri listened to my long history, heard my concerns, asked questions, reviewed my xrays then made short term and long term recommendations, including a written detailed referral to a specialist.

I felt a relief because I was heard and I was understood. She was calm, very detailed and took time. The office staff was very kind and helpful. I was even offered a water bottle to drink.
This dental clinic addresses other dental/medical issues beside general dentistry. I look forward getting my dental and other health issues addressed there too.

I highly recommend Dr. Woodlief's, DMD, clinic and Dr. Khouri,  DDS  services.< /Review>< Pics>

All of the staff excel in taking superlative care of me.  I've had 4 crowns replaced due to old age and a cavity filled. The fastidious hygienist, Erin, performed X-rays and thorough cleanings. Dr. Khouri and Emily, her assistant went thru all the steps in my tricky improvements of top notch dentistry.  I had 2 rear molar crowns that fortunately (Dr Khouri and Emily) for me were replaced instead of a root canal (old, deteriorated Western Dental (a joke). The best is last, as Jaylin, the receptionist and staff organizer handled my insurance, calls, appointments and finances with a smile.  Oh, pardon the pun.  The entire staff is awesome!</Review>< pictures>

I love Dr. Woodlief. I was under his care for almost two years on a regular basis. I can honestly say as a person who has interacted with hundreds of medical professions both as an RN and as a patient, Dr. Woodlief is the best doctor that I have ever encountered. He is not only very knowledge but if he does not know something he will admit it along with researching to find best to find a solution. He genuinely cares about his patients and their well-being. I wish every doctor practiced like Dr. Woolief.
He also found a solution to my insomnia! So grateful!<//Review>

<text>I have been going to Dr. Woodlief for over 10 years.  I recently moved to Gilroy and tried going to a different dentist for about a year.  Well, they couldn't provide me with the care and service I have received with Dr. Woodlief.  I have three girls and it was getting a little difficult for me to do the drive, but after experiencing other dentists services, I decided he is well worth the drive.  His staff and his expertise is well worth the extra miles.  He takes time to talk to you and listens, something you don't get now a days.  Thank you so much Dr.< /text>< rate>

I just had my first appointment with Dr. Woodlief yesterday, so I ordinarily wouldn’t provide a review just yet, but he inspires so much confidence that I have no worries about writing one already.

I went in for advice on some breathing issues I have that may also be related to my sleep apnea and chronic headaches. Immediately, the entire office makes you feel welcome and it’s clear that everyone there is quite expert in what they do. Dr. Woodlief, as mentioned above, inspires tremendous confidence. He’s a true expert in this field and his examination and explanation of the issue was so thorough and presented so clearly that I had no concerns whatsoever about committing to an 18 month program with him. I’m really excited for my treatment to begin and feel like I couldn’t be in better hands.

You will be very pleased.<//text>

< Review>
Attended Dr. Woodlief in 2011. I was having the same problem so contact his office to get appointment. It was nice cause I was able to be see him with then the next 2 hours. Ten minutes later I got a call back from another young lady who said there prices went up. I said ok no problem she stated it would be $150.00 just for the xray and $100 exam. I still said ok I wanted to continue with the appointment. Ask me to hold on then came back on the line and stated the doctor will not be able to prescribe any antibiotics or and pain medicine. Which I haven't ask for any way. All I wanted to do is to have my tooth work on since it was bothering me. Then she said sorry we will not be able to see you today. I have never done anything to office. I thought he was a good Dentist. Living in the San Jose area its rarely we see black doctors. He let his Mexican staff run away a black patient for no reason. She didn't have to speak to me or mistreat they she did.< /Review>

Dr. Woodlief is one the most amazing humans I have ever met! He is smart, kind, knowledgeable, and cares about you as a patient. I had migraine headaches that reoccurred in the same spot in my head that started years ago and I would get them once a week. These headaches would completely destroy me and ruin my entire day. I couldn’t do anything. I went to my regular doctor and he prescribed me medication that didn’t help at all. I tried everything from stopping all coffee consumption, eating healthier, getting prescription eyeglasses, and much more and NOTHING helped. I did more research online and found Dr. Woodlief and saw all the great reviews of how he has helped people with their chronic headaches with his medical devices. I thought that there was no way the headaches were coming from my jaw or mouth but I said what the hell, what do I have to lose? I went in and saw Dr. Woodlief who took x-rays of my jaw, saw that the joints weren’t aligned properly, and built me some retainer like medical devices to wear in my mouth. As soon I started wearing them regularly MY HEADACHES WERE GONE!!!! After years of suffering, my headaches were 100% gone because of Dr. Woodlief and his devices!! I recommend him to everyone I can’t believe he cured my headaches. He is an amazing doctor!! :)</Review>

I tried several dentists, physical therapists and orthodontists before finding Dr. Woodlief. He has been the only one to help my TMJ! I am a young woman in my 30's, and enjoy playing the violin. My TMJ had gotten so bad that my jaw would freeze when I was trying to open my mouth take a bite of food! I would have to put down my spoon, wait a minute, then try to open my mouth again. The pain and pressure in my jaw and forehead got so bad that I had to completely give up playing my violin, which devastated me! By the time I found Dr Woodlief, I could only open my mouth 24mm, which he told me at my first appointment, that a normal mouth should be able to open at least 45-52 mm! No wonder I was in so much pain and discomfort! Dr. Woodlief started my treatment by having me wear a custom made pivot appliance, which fit on my mandible and was so small and unobtrusive, I quickly got used to it, and wore it constantly. Within 1 month, I could start opening my jaw farther, and combined with his prolotherapy injections in my TMJ, within 9 months, I could open my jaw 52mm without any clunking or freezing of the TMJ joint! To say that I am ecstatic is an understatement! I have been given my normal life back, thanks to Dr. Woodlief and his amazing staff!! I now am continuing on with further treatment, proceeding with the DNA appliance for a long term solution, to make sure my TMJ problems never come back. Dr Woodlief educated me that my TMJ disfunction was greatly due to my upper arch being extremely narrow and high and the arch of my teeth was shaped like a mushroom instead of a uniform arch. For a person of my stature, 5' 10" and medium build frame, my upper arch was way too small to support all the pressure and pounds of force my TMJ has to withstand when I eat, and when I play violin. I have been in the DNA appliance treatment now for 6 months, and I can tell the difference with how much better I am able to eat and chew my food. I never could chew before with my molars -my front anterior teeth were angled too straight up and down and stopped my jaw from closing like it should and kept my top and lower molars from making contact, so I couldn't chew my food correctly! It's amazing what you just think is normal in your body until you know differently! I am now looking forward to a fuller smile as my arch is being gently widened every month. Oh, and did I mention that I can play my violin again? I cried tears of joy picking up my violin and playing it again, for you see, it is my great-great-grandfather's violin, and my heritage. God bless you, Dr. Woodlief!< /review>< Pics>

<text>I purchased groupon voucher. I made reservation weeks ago and that appointment date, reservation representive called me at that morning to cancel the appointment due to doctor's schedule. I made 2nd appointment but just before 2 hours before scheduled time, staff called me again to cancel again!! Because they are too busy because there is a lot of groupon customer? I don't  understand their policy but I don't get it. They are still selling groupon voucher right now. If there is no sufiicient time and staff for groupon customer they should not sell these anymore. I had call to groupon custermer service and it wasn't pleasant at all. DO NOT PURCHASE GROUPON ANY MORE!!<//text><date>1416428139352</date><username>Jiwon Yoon< /username></record>

< review>
Dr. Woodlief, office and staff are consummate professionals.  I am extremely lucky to have known Dr. Woodlief since the 70's and can say without reservation that he is an amazing dentist. Specifically if you do not like shots (and who does) I have to say that Dr. Woodlief gave me the absolute least painful shot I have ever had in my life.  I was pleasantly shocked.  I completely recommend Dr. Woodlief to anyone seeking a healthy smile.</review>

<Review>If I could, I would not put a star at all!  They  did a horrible job to my daughter's hair.  A photo was shown so the stylist could see what kind of haircut was wanted.  Said she could do it and in the end my daughter got a hatchet job done!  I would not recommend this place to no one.  If you can't do something then just admit to it. We had to go to another salon to get it fixed.  Stay away from this place unless you want the same hatchet results.</Review>< Pics>

<review>Called and was told they where open till 8pm arrived at 7:35 and was told they where not taking anyone else i explained to them i called to confirm they where still open and they straight out refused
They seem like my time to drive there wasn't that important
So if they say they are open till eight on there website then they should have accepted my business. Since they are a customer base business very unprofessional!<//review>< GmapID>

<user_name>D L<//user_name><review>Ordered 8 wings, a gyros combo w/ salad and asked the guy to charge me $5 for a tip over the phone since I was stuck in quarantine and couldn’t come in contact with the delivery person. They charged me $37! The menu I have makes that purchase $27 with the tip. When my order arrived, I was hoping for an itemized receipt to see where the extra $10 went. No such luck. Enjoy my money.

This place is a hidden gem 💎  I always add extra cheese to my pizza and it comes out great 👍  I don’t order from anywhere else! Better taste for half the price. Thank you! PRO TIP: Call in your order & it will be ready by the time you get there😁📲</text>

Never ordering from here again.
They send a pizza that was bunched up and just messed up in the box like it was thrown in the trunk of a car to where half the toppings were just a glob, they sent the wrong kind of pizza from what i ordered but still charged me the same price even though the one I got was cheaper on the menu, and the wings had the wrong sauce on them too and had soo much powder or whatever was on it i ended up throwing it away it was soo bad.
I don't ask for much in life, but when i spend months on end in the ocean and all I want is a correct order (not even a great pizza, I know the quality i am getting as Giant Pizza King already has a reputation on the naval base for low quality) well if it were not for the fact that your the exclusive company that delivers on base I could not be surprised if you went out of business. That's all the energy you get out of me. Im going to Costco, at least they get their orders right.</review>

I just got back to the states after being deployed for a year. I got a giant pizza for the whole work center. As the name implied it was huge and fed 8 of us! Just wanted to give my thanks, meant a lot to us and was delicious!<//Review>

If you expect food to be delivered at your door 2 hours later to be hot, I'm not sure anyone can meet your expectations. I got my food, went to a new restaurant opening, and ate my sandwich about 5 hours after. I ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich, Kalifornia Fried Cauliflower, and Fried Avocado.</text>

Their pizza is DELICIOUS. The people who work there are really patient and nice. Today I bought the $5 large pizza slice, it was extremely tasteful. It was fluffy, cheesey, and enough pepperoni to give it a tiny kick of hot. I recommend it to everyone who lives in that area.

<Review>The $5 large pepperoni pizza is a great deal. I bought some wings also (8 of them for $7.99)...they were average...a little chewy. I would reccomend that you stick with a pizza (or 2), you can get a large all cheese or a large cheese and pepperoni for $5 each. The pizzas are made to order, so be prepared to wait about 10 minutes...but it's worth it to get hot, fresh pizzas at this price! The staff are friendly too. I will definitely  be back for more. 😊👍<//Review>< pics>

<text>I ordered pizza for my daughters Birthday. The gentlemen taking my order repeated my order. My husband picked up the food and they made a mistake on my order. They ended up just putting some pepperoni on top of the pizza which didn’t taste the same. On his way out the lady asked my husband if he paid $130+ he said yes I did. The female worker rudely tells him well I won’t charge you those $7 for the pepperoni I added.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<Text>I ordered a pizza over 2.5 hrs ago and still haven't gotten it yet, would never recommend this place to anyone. The pizza is absolutely amazing but the delivery is worse than any other place in sandiego for sure

*** Update it's now been 3 hrs since I ordered the pizza and it still hasn't been delivered. I called and the manager said the pizza was still on the way

** Update after four house of waiting, I finally received my pizza at 952 after cancelling my order and placing another one.... This place sucks, the driver's suck and this experience ruins pizza for the rest of my life< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I only order delivery from Giant Pizza King so this review is based on the food and timing. I've ordered different plates at different times/days and the food has always been really amazing in really quick delivery time. Never been disappointed. They are my go to when it comes to Italian food delivery.< /Text>

Are the pizzas giant? Absolutely. We ordered the biggest pizza and I had barely any room to get through the door to leave! However, it did kind of just taste like cardboard 😬 but it was fun to get a pizza that size and the kids were excited about it.<//Review>

Good pizza at good price. The place needs a little touch up (it feels outdated), but they have good and friendly service. The pizza is flavorful and the dough is soft and yummy. I usually don't eat the edges (crust) but with this one I didn't leave any on my plate. I would recommend for a cheap and hot meal. POA: Place order ahead of time by phone if you're in a hurry.</review>

Really wish we could post zero stars..ordered a pizza at 4:12. As of 7:50...15  phone calls later (6 of them they never answered)..5 times we've been told the driver will be there any minute..still no pizza. This is not the first time they have done this. I would love to comment on how hot and delicious the pizza is, but every time we've received one, it's been cold and old. If you've got time to kill and have already eaten, go ahead and order delivery.<//review>

Ordered a pizza from here a while ago, got a deal from their flyer and everything went smoothly. called again to place the same order a couple weeks later, was told that deal is carryout only(its on the delivery side of the flyer) and that it was 10$ over the listed price. the only thing i asked different was that there be ham instead of pepperoni(flyer says 1 topping). they wanted to charge me for the pepperoni and ham even though i wasn't getting the pepperoni. seemed shady so i decided to not order. probably wont order again.</text>

Also wearing sandals well working in a food environment is unsanitary! Wings were dry, ranch I was given was rotten, I'm sadden because we like your pizza! But this is bad.< /review>< pics>

Very nice quiet pizza place in an unsuspecting shopping center. We go here regularly. The service is on point along with the taste. The price is pretty good. 10 bucks for a decent sized pizza.< /Review>

Ordered a giant pizza and 2 orders of wings(12pcs). I drove about 10 mins to pick it up and paid $56 dlls, when I got home i noticed i was missing 2  wings. I know it might sound exaggerated to make such a big deal, but i called the place only to tell them my experience so they would pay more attention. After waiting about 5 mins on the line the person who i spoke to me was overall rude! He said u payed too much cuz you had too many toppings; which i responded I wasn't arguing about the price, that I just had a suggestion. He said "oh well so i owe you 2 wings" which by then it didn'atter nomore! Customer service sucks, you shouldn't own or work in a restaurant. I'm pretty sure if i was short 5 dlls on my money you would not be so careless. And the pizza it self had no flavor, so I am never going back.</text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Worth going if youre looking for some great standard pizza. Top ingredients. Crust soft with a crisp! Owner was very friendly. Recommend dine in or take out to get fresh out!</Text>

<Text>Don’t order from here !  I was so upset today!
I ordered my pizza online on their website for lunch at 11am hoping to get it at 12pm. I called to see what was going on because  it was taking forever . Long story short, they delivered the pizza to another place 2 hours later ! My co workers and I ordered the pizza to have a Valentine’s Day lunch. The Giant pizza king place said they had delivered it and that someone had signed my receipt. My coworker had to go to the buildings across the street to see if someone had taken our pizza. Yes, we were that mad and hungry , our order was around $50.
And yes, another building received our pizza!!
I called Giant Pizza King and they didn’t even have the courtesy to at least give me my money back for the bad customer service. They wanted to charge me for another pizza and for me to pay them in cash because they couldn’t do a refund because the pizza had been delivered. When it wasn’t even delivered to the right place ! It was ridiculous!!! Giant pizza king employees ended up showing up to my work place. They stated that they went to the place I put on the online order. They couldn’t admit they just gave my order to the wrong building . Not once did they apologize for the inconvenience or the horrible costumer service. They were both upset and since I was already back on the clock , I told them to just leave. Terrible service !< /Text>< Pics>

Great price and delicious taste. 10/10 you guys won me over.</text></record>

Absolute worst service I have ever had. Got a text message my pizza was delivered went outside and no one was there. Waited for 10 minutes before calling and was informed that they called and when I didn't asnser they left even though I never actually got a phone call. Ithey said the person was on their way back so I waited outside so I wouldn't miss them for another 20 min. After still nothing I called back and was told "well we tried calling you and since you didn't answer she went to make other deliveries. You should have picked up the phone" and when I told him my phone never rang he told me it was not his problem. When I said "so basically I'm getting cold pizza then?" And he said unequivocally "yes."

Will NEVER order from here again.<//Text>

Done trying with this shop. Owners nice but they always screw up my pizza orders. Decided I couldn't call it in, went inside ordered a triple pepperoni since I feel they skimp on toppings. They gave me one with normal pepperoni and the owners excuse was he didn't charge me extra. Sell me what I ordered!
Called in an order of wings. Gave them my name and number. Show up and pay. Ask if it's ready and they said they were giving it to the lady that only called in a pizza. "Do you want us put more in for you?"</text>

I just Ordered two large pizzas, they told me 10 mins wait, in about 5 mins they tell me my order is ready which was #984. Ofcourse the box feels warm it was sitting on top of the oven when i get home (i live about 2-3 mins away) the pizza was cold and the bread was hard. I know that pizza had to have been sitting there for quite some time. Then I realize both boxes were labeled order #962. That’s 22 orders before mine! I called to let them know so they don’t do it again but I wasn’t gonna go back swapping pizzas, they should have got em right the first time😒</Review>

pizza is amazing first of all but be warn if u don’t tell them u want the $5 pepperoni pizza they will charge you their original price for a 14”large with cheese only $9 instead of being $5 their price inside does not match what shows outside the window, they almost charged me double but I decided to wait to get a different cashier and ask for a $5 pizza with somebody else, since I thought the first cashier would have automatically offered me the $5 pizza instead he was willing to charge me twice.👎🏽</Review>

Worst place to get pizza. Called 2 hours ago for a large and a medium pizza and we are literally still waiting for it to be delivered. Called several times and the manager was of no help. Just kept saying the driver is on his way. Still waiting.</text>

(Translated by Google) I bought two pizzas, one they sent me in a good presentation, the other I don't know if they shut up and so they sent me terrible service and poor quality

(Translated by Google) Buy 2 slice of pizza. The mace was raw. And as it was to take away I did not realize till I went to the house.

<time>1614988042650<//time><rating>5</rating>< Review>
I went to Right Out ER yesterday for an urgent issue and was treated the the utmost respect. The staff was efficient, fast, professional, and kind. I watched them get a translator for a gentleman also being treated. They also explained to multiple families that they couldn't bring their children inside because of current COVID posturing in the kindest way possible. They were respectful and understanding and I was out of the ER in less than approx 2 hours, even though they did multiple labs and an ultrasound. Simply amazing. Well done guys.<//Review>

Ok. So few months ago, I left a 1 star review but after my recent visit things has changed a lot. The staff this time was really nice and helpful. They were very caring and loving people. Keep up the good work. Please keep all the nice staff because when people come to emergency room , attitude is the last thing we should worry about.</text>

I was recently discharged (last week) from a 6 day treatment stay for Cellulitis of my right leg.  I would like to express my appreciation and feelings about the treatment care and consideration of all the staff that was watching over and treating me.  I have never been in a hospital for anything for this length of time in my 81 plus years on this planet.  It was so much appreciated for the care, concern, treatment and kindness of all the medical (and security) people there that helped me thru this difficult and painful time.  The mental positivity that was provided by everyone was so much needed and beneficial for the mental process pacification promoting the improvement needed.  Again, thank you, and no offense, but I hope I don't need to come back to medically visit again.< /text>

I’m going to get their names ,Nurses like these  should not be taking care of patients and should lose there licenses , even the person in charge who was a man showed more inappropriate and shocking misconduct along with such rude reactions to patients like these nurses although I had some awesome nurses who was on top of their job . These others aren’t fit to work with people .

Girlfriend went into the ER a week ago. While heading into a room, she dropped her cell phone. A nurse picked it up and said they would bring it to her. After a week, still no cell phone. Multiple phone calls with multiple people have yielded no results in locating the phone. Most people we have talked to bounce us to another person. We want to believe it is lost, sitting somewhere in the hospital, but could it have been stolen? Maybe. I would hope not. Further, her clothes and shoes are also missing. I'm thinking everything is together. Why can no one find these items? Why is no one looking? I get that COVID is incapacitating our hospitals and I don't want to dismiss that, but please, keep track of every patient's belongings.

Furthermore, I am quite dismayed at the response of one particular department that is supposed to be caring for and treating my girlfriend so she can come home - they have refused to see her in person and they refuse to do a telehealth appointment. This department is refusing to do their job.

She went to Rideout as it was near home and this is how she and her belongings are treated. The hippocratic oath says to do no harm. This experience feels like quite the opposite.

If anyone from Adventist or Rideout reads this, please message me and we can discuss these matters in more detail.<//Text>

I delivered my son there and all my delivery nurses were very kind and helpful including my OB...however once  they moved me to an actual room the nurses downstairs werent as helpful only like 2 nurses out of the two days i stayed there...only 2 were very kind and amazingly helpful the one that was the sweetest was more on the older side like 40s 50s she took good care of me baby and partner...as she has kids of her own and grandkids....she was just very sweet and understandable and made us feel welcomed.

i also do recommend going to another near by hospital  dont go to this hospital they will let you dieeee....they dont help much.</review>

My husband was referred to the ER for a COVID-19 test by his doctor before he would see him.  He informed the ER Nurse he just needed a COVID test but they did blood work and chest X-ray on him too.  He sat in the ER for three hours waiting for the results.  The nurse informed him they were waiting for a bed so the ER doctor could see him.  He told the nurse he didn’t need a bed and left.  He was there for approximately three and a half hours. He told me he was never going back. I was hoping that when Adventist Health took over Rideout that the services would be improved.  Not true.  Next time we’re going to Roseville even if it is 40 minutes away.</text>

I am approximately one month post op hip surgery. I had to visit the radiology department for an xray. I went to Rideout for the xray. They would not allow my daughter to come in with me, supposedly, due to covid. There were several families past the check-in place. Why were all these family members here together, but we were told my daughter could not go with me?  I am still struggling tremendously with getting around with my hip & knee.

While I was waiting in line at the check-in at radiology department, the woman ahead of me stood at check-in counter filling out her paperwork. My hip & knee were hurting. If I sat down, I would lose my place in the line. I was forced to wait for this woman to finish.

It is extremely difficult for a handicapped or temporarily handicapped person to navigate alone. They require an additional person with them sometimes. If my daughter had been allowed with me, I would not have needed to experience the extreme discomfort I did.<//review>

The ER is great. I sit here typing with one hand as I broke the other. I'm probably known as the desk puncher now 😂 but the staff were great. Wait was reasonable for an ER. The nurses were great and help relieve that hospital stress easily with great humor. The doctor was fantastic and very friendly and covered everything I needed to know before I even asked. I'd say I'd love to come back but let's hope I don't.< /Review>

<Time>1592782651424<//Time><text>My mother went in with pain in her stomach,they took her in for an overnigh observation. Day later she was going to be released, but somehow she fell and cracked her head. Later that day after 5 hrs she was transferred to a different hospital because Rideout did not have that resources that my mom needed.

Rest In Peace to my mom, she went on to a coma and died 13 days later. This hospital has very horrible service and lacks resources.</text><user_name>Chriz Gary< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Some of the staff at this hospital was nice and helpful, some was not. I could give the benefit of the doubt but it was noon so everyone should have been refreshed. Customer service could use some brushing up on. I arrived in an ambulance and the experience could have been better. I was not dying but again, with arriving in an ambulance, my experience could have been better. The wait time was ridiculous. If you can avoid going to an emergency room, I would recommend avoiding it. It was other people in the waiting room complaining to staff about the long wait times also. The hospital is a typical hospital, I do feel I was cared for adequately. I just feel maybe getting nice staff, more doctors so the wait time is cut a bit and/or giving patients updates on their status would have made the experience better. But again, this is a typical hospital and I did get the care that I went there for. If there is an absolute emergency, yes, you will get taken care of here. The facility was nice and clean.< /review>

The Er nurse Ryan+Shandra and registration clerk Casandra  were  helpful and fun in the Emergency room. if I had a question Casandra was always helpful and made me laugh in a time when I was in extreme pain. If I could have shandra as my personal doctor I would go to her in a heartbeat, she’s personable and goes the extra mile to make sure your ok. same for Ryan.
Ive come to the er on numerous occasions and I would recommend going during the early hours if possible, staff is friendlier and better care in my opinion.
best visit Ive had so far< /review>

I just had my daughter here and it was okay, some of the staff was more helpful than others, I didn't care much for the food until they sent up a menu specialist. It was better than I have witnessed the older hospital or version of that hospital, it's better thsn it was 5 years ago.< /Text>

HORRIBLE. I explicitly said my grandpa was vegetarian and did not speak english. However, a nurse brought in pasta with beef meatballs. I told her to please get another one. She said the kitchen is working on it. Procedded to tell two other nurses after 40 more minutes. NOTHING. lunch never came. DO NOT COME HERE. In addition, while waiting for a room there was an elderly individual who was screaming and yelling in pain. A Male nurse said "why are you yelling?" In perhaps the most condescending way possible. I actually wanted to go over there and slap him. It offended me that much hearing such disrespect</review>

<review>Ride out is a good name for this hospital.... being that u gotta ride with your pain for at least 6 hrs before u can be seen by a bunch of high school kids at best that are still trying to get there license... I have never seen so much incompetence in all my live... your better off sitting in the comfort of your own home and bleading out rather then taking the trip to the most uncomfortable, unresponsive, and incompetent emergency room ever... negative 10 review here...< /review>< GmapID>

Some of their Drs. and Nurses are average at best, but there are some Drs. that my mom had as she was on her way out of this world that were top notch.  One of them I have the utmost respect for since in my 61 years on this planet no Dr. has ever cared enough to give me a direct line to his office let alone as this Dr. did, give me his personal cell phone number so if I had any concerns I could call him.  That is going above and beyond.  Again not many of the Drs. are like this but if you push and search you can find a diamond in the rough.< /review>< userid>

One star for the triage nurses and the laboratory.  The doctor never saw me, and I left because of the pain without medication after waiting for more than four hours sitting on a hard chair.  The hospital is worse now than ten years ago.  The bracelet had the wrong last name, and they did not want to change it.  Consequently, my grandson called and they told him I wasn't there.  Close the hospital, and start all over again.</Review>

Had an experience with the nurse in room 27 at 740 pm on 12/7/19. Hopefully mamagement will look into this and take action. My son was suppose to be being observed, when he needed to use the restroom, asked the employee observing him to take him. She had her headphones in and watching her phone to the extent that she could not hear or see that he was trying to get her attention. Said the one getting paid ahoyld be doing her jjob, and was told not to be rude, and i was told to leave the room or security would be called. Great observation going on at thos hospital.< /review>

Good to have in the area. Newly renovated section just added. The staff can be very helpful and nice on good days. Hopefully with the new addition, they get more staff to help serve patients as they visit. They really needed more help over there at times, because doctors have been over worked and just not enough available to help you in reasonable time. However I've had decent experience here.< /Text>

I hope to God I'm never in Marysville when I'm ill. While the nurses are fantastic the lack of time the doctors are available to actually spend with patients is horrible. My Grandmother was there and the waiting to get to see someone because it was the weekend or because they weren't available excuses were just not ok. If you don't have adequate staffing then you should refer patients out to other hospitals IMHO.  My Grandmother passed away there and I still wish we wouldn't have taken her.< /Review>

The hospital has improved a lot over the years and so have the staff. They do read these reviews and they try to be better and yes I know the wait is a long time but now depending on the wait is depending on the problem you might have. I am very lucky to live near a hospital that will go out of their way just to save other people lives and i think you should too< /review>

<Text>Worst and and scariest hospital I've ever been in. Nasty rude and uncaring nurse Natasha. Left my iv dry with a bubble warning light and loud buzzing for way over an hour. 4 calls to the nurses station didn't help. She was so rude when she finally came making sure it was clear that I wasn't her only patient. No one would tell me anything and when my husband asked, very politely, when she thought my doctor would come in her answer was, very rudely said he has a whole hospital to see. Horrible experience!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

This hospital is a veterinarian facility allowed to operate on people   A cockroach motel you can check in but you won't check out.  Have heard horror story after horror story about this worthless place and how they try to operate on you for having a common cold in order to make money.  Misdiagnosing patients to get them on the operating table on a daily basis.  Unfortunately most people don't realize this till its too late, this review is just a humble attempt to save lives.  Yes its near, but so is the local cemetary.< /review>

<text>I was hesitant coming here last night with my awfull pain I've been having but had no choice.
The ER treated me FANTASTIC. They were kind and took me right in seeing that I was in pain. I was in a room before I new it. I was fully taken care of. Thank you to all of the people of the ER room. And thankyou to the Security at the door who first saw me and took my name. I am sure he pasted on that I was in real pain to the nurses. Thank you all😊</text>< Pics>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Text>If you can get to another hospital, GO! ill start with the positive..they are quick to get you triaged and blood drawn. Thats it. Last night i went in because my feet, ankles and calves swelled up out if nowhere and i was feeling lightheaded and dizzy and had shortness of breath. I waited for 2 hours in the lobby, which was empty. The lady at the desk said it was probably just a spider bite...on both ankles at the same exact time. They finally took me into a little side room where i waited another hour and a half for the same desk girl to come in and tell me my hemoglobin was low and to follow up with my doctor if my feet stayed swollen for over a week. Absolutely none of my symptoms were addressed. I never even saw a doctor! And if that girl had actually looked at my previous bloodwork, she would have seen that my hemoglobin level was normal for me. Im anemic! Always have been. It was VERY obvious they were blowing me off. So now its the next day and i have all the same symptoms plus im nauseous so ill have to go to the urgent care or a different hospital this evening.

Never trust people that use your life for money. Cops, lawyers, doctors, car sellsman, corrupt politicians and more. The more you go see a doctor the more experience they have seeing patients then they get paid more. Not helping... Seeing you. Thats how funding works its shitholes of this world. California is one of the worst.  Everyone wants to make money off nothing....  Pathetic. Not all people in cali or course.</text>< Pics>

<text>This hospital should be shut down, the disconnect with the patients is ridiculous...they make you feel like your a burden to them.   The renovations may look good, but you can put makeup on a pig, but it's still a pig.
We are not treated like humans, just numbers to get that mighty dollar! These doctors and nurses seem to have lost the compassion that goes into health care.</text>< pics>

Been here for 3 hours as others get help. Mom can't breathe and no one has helped. Nurse yelled at us because we asked for help. Very unprofessional. You can tell nurses just here for paycheck.
Update. Came back because my GF was very sick. They had her in waiting room in front of everyone for 4 hours. The were taking her vitals in the lobby while we watched other people get rooms. She was throwing up in lobby garbage cans and screaming because of the pain. And hospital didn't care. The waiting room wasn't even full so they probably cut back on staff to make more money. We were also lied to 3 times. Wish Kaiser would have took it over. We are driving to a real hospital.< /Review>

This place is just awful. They don’t care about their patients. Blonde woman at check in was very rude and had lots of attitude, so disrespectful. We waited for over 6 hours for a room. They gave my dad narcos and let him pass out for the next few hours so they wouldn’t have to deal with him.  You’re better off calling an ambulance if you can. Otherwise you’ll die waiting in that waiting room. Go somewhere else please</Review>

< review>
I knew Rideout was bad four years ago when I waiting in the ER lobby five hours without seeing a doctor while having a heart attack.  Many seemed to suggest now that the new additions were open (maybe more than a year now) they’ve gotten better and all the issues are resolved, or at least improved.

Wrong!!!  Very similar circumstance, only now with my wife.  I have never seen a hospital ask for billing before maybe a quick query on why you’re there.  The poor young woman behind us nearly dropped her very young child with a broken arm because they needed ID from her first.  We didn’t stay and see how much more had “improved” at Rideout. We left and drove to a hospital in Roseville where guess what?  The first question was “why are you here?”

I let my prior experience at Rideout go as perhaps bad luck or a bad day. As you can read in the posting of this review, this won’t happ n twice.  Rideout really needs to figure out how to improve or just start a medical shuttle to surrounding facilities.

On a more personal note... earlier reviews suggest the staff at Rideout read these reviews and strive to improve. Maybe I can hope the admitting ER nurse/admin/whatever will recognize these circumstances and think, “was I the one who brought out such strong negative feelings that a man would be this angry?”  I would love for that woman to understand what an uncompromising b***h she was.<//review>

This is by far the worst experience that we have had in a hospital ever. The nurses were good at caring for my wife but seemed to be reserved and maybe a little embarrassed  about my comments about the room.  The rooms are not big enough for 2 patients, visitors, computer for both patients and the rest of the staff that are in and out at all times of the day. The floor is nasty and housekeeping checked on the room one time in 4 days.  My wife had to use the portable toilet next to her bed (Go LYTELY treatment) for everyone to see and hear.  She was basically on her own during this time. Staff was kind and caring but the room was terrible.< /text>

<review>It's unfortunate to have to put it this way, but it seems to depend on what time you are going to the hospital, whether you are coming in via ambulance, and who on staff is working at the time. I have had both absolutely terrible experiences with Rideout and decent/good experiences with Rideout. If given the choice, though, I would prefer to go to Davis or Sacramento.

BTW: The 65,000+ residents of Yuba City need their own hospital. If both bridges into Marysville are shut down (which happened during the Oroville Dam debacle and will most likely happen again in the future), people pretty much have to plan on dying.</review>< Pics>

I tell my family...Unless I am dying take me to Sacramento or Enloe in Chico. The hospital is dirty in the old parts. I watched a man be left in a hallway for over nine hours half clothed. Some of the staff is amazing some is amazingly awful. It has never taken less than 9 hours in the ER. And after all that they did not recognize what was wrong with my 8 yo son. They said they "Have no clue." Gave Motrin for fever. Turned out my son had the Zika virus. And Motrin is actually the worst thing it makes it worse possibly fatal. I recommend IF you can go to any hospital in Sacramento or Enloe in Chico. Then that IS the best choice.< /Review>

< review>
I wish I can say this hospital is great because it is the closest one to where I reside; however, I am very disappointed by the services I received when I was admitted to the hospital a week ago.  When I was discharged, the doctor told me that someone will contact me the next day to get my oxygen and I never heard back from the hospital.  I never heard back from them.  As a patient, I trust that the information provided to me by the doctor is accurate, however, it was not the case.  After contacting them to follow up, they said they normally don't give patients oxygen (never was it mentioned by the doctor when I was discharged).  They also told me they will find out more and let me know within a day and yet I have not heard from them after two days.  This experience makes me very angry because I felt like the hospital staff did not care about me as a patient at all.  The staff needs to do a better job at communicating information to its patient.  It is unacceptable to tell their patient one thing and NEVER follow through.  Horrible ER experience!!!!!<//review>

I suffered a heart attack just two month after moving back to the Yuba-Sutter area.  I initially went to urgent care and was transferred by ambulance to Rideout Hospital. I received very good care from the time I walked in to urgent care to the time of my discharge from the hospital.
The time spent in the ER before admittance to a room was a bit excessive but nonetheless, the care was exceptional.  While being away from this area for 17 yrs and having no knowledge of doctors or caregivers in this area, I believe I was assigned one of the best surgeons for my bypass surgery.  I feel the ICU staff gave their best and most professional care while at the same time, were very personable. Once moved to the cardiac ward, the care was very good.
Even follow up with my surgeon and cardiologist have shown they pay attention to the patient’s input as well as discernment of their medical expertise, and experience. Thank You for saving my life!< /text>

<text>Sincere appreciation for the excellent care I received from an efficient, attentive and kind staff before and after an angiogram and 1 other procedure on February 3, 2017.  I thank all who assisted Dr Brar with my procedures and especially my nurse Patina and the gentleman who was a nurse for the procedure. Their kindness was very reassuring and comforting.  Patina was extremely attentive and made sure my recovery was as comfortable as possible.  I can't say enough about Dr Brar. Words cannot sufficiently express my sincere appreciation.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

I think that Rideout Hospital has drastically improved over the 10 years  I have been out of the area. I honestly  feel that my overall experience with the ER and East wing 2nd floor doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists, nurses aides, and general  staff was excellent. I actually have had a traumatic hospital experience which has caused me to have a phobia but Rideout has helped me face my fears. They  made me feel reassured my children were in good hands. I say GREAT JOB ! Keep up the good work! And All of you should feel proud of the accomplishments here and I personally commend  you all! Sincerely, Crystal Arey< /text>

I used to feel like the hospital was a place that can help you in any situation but after going to Rideout three times in the last 6 months I realize that the doctors overlook many aspects of what your dealing with and if you are having serious complications there's a good chance they would let you die in the waiting room. the shortest time I waited was 4 hours. a few months ago my doctor directly admitted me to this hospital and they still made me wait in the waiting room for over 8 hours. they kept telling me there were no beds open but when I finally got upstairs the nurses told me there had been beds open the whole time... not to mention the horrible care during the 4 days I was there, THIS PLACE NEEDS TO BE SHUT DOWN<//text></record>

The Mental Health Unit is the worst unit I was in . I was excitable with Case Management I was treated with disrespect. The RN told me I needed to calm down. The Food was not good it was ice cold. Don't go to this Hospital if you can prevent it.</Text>

<Review>Do yourself and your loved ones a favor: drive to Sutter Roseville. This is the biggest joke of a hospital I’ve ever had the displeasure of coming to. I have been here on several occasions for my son and myself. This last trip has included rude lab technicians drawing blood from me, arguing with me when I ask what they are drawing from my body, and rudely telling me I wouldn’t know what it is anyway. I’ve also been given medication that’s unsafe for pregnant women despite being tested twice for Pregnancy. There is an utter lack of communication from the doctors to the patients and, seemingly, the doctors to the other doctors, nurses, and technicians. I have had one doctor I’ve had a good experience with, Dr Bahia, but the rest have been rude, absent, or unenthused. I just want to go home, yet I am still here, with no answers, with people drawing blood without knowing what they are drawing for, and berating me when I ask.
I will say- the nursing staff and CNAs are fantastic. They are clearly overworked and short staffed, but they are fantastic, helpful, and have excellent bedside manner.</Review>< Pics>

I had my son on the 21st of August and left on the 23rd. The discharge nurse left his umbilical cord clamp on and it got ripped off causing a infection. After checking with a couple of friends that just had babies and the hospital removed their babies clips I called to ask if they were supposed to remove it before we left, they said yes and they're sorry they didn't and it was a good thing that I'm taking him to the doctors to be seen!< /review>

< Review>
My mom went by ambulance at 2am and didnt getting admitted until almost 3pm the next day. I am the power of attorney for my mother, this hospital wont release any information regarding my moms health status to me. I am extremely frustrated and will never let any family memeber come to this hospital again.
Secondly, when my mother came to the E.R. for a prior visit a woman passed out in a wheelchair and hit her head really hard. I had two run out in the hallway to say a woman just passed out and hit her head. Two nurses made no effort to rush to her side and actually had the nerve to ask her if she is okay? Are you kidding? I dont know a single person in the world who would be okay after passing out and hittinf their head. Completely unprofessional and very poor patient care.<//Review>

Worst ER I have ever been to. All they want is money. The ER will charge you for the “usage of the facility” and the doctors will sent you a separate bill because “they are contractors”</Text>

I have been a patient at Rideout Hospital twice.  The first time was the  last week of April 2017.  I had gone in to Emergency with breathing problems and they kept me for 9 days which I spent on the 2nd floor.  The nurses were great and my overall experience was good.  The 2nd time I was only there overnight on June 29 and 30th.  It was the worst experience of my life.  I had a procedure done and they kept me overnight.  After I was in my room for awhile the nurse said they were going to put a catheter in for urine.  They used their fingernails and hurt me so bad that I couldn't even wipe myself for over a week.  Then later that night the nurse was in my room and I told her I had to throw up.  She didn't even acknowledge me and I was forced to throw up in a small styrofoam cup and had made a mess on the side of my bed that was never cleaned up. I fell back to sleep for awhile  but woke up a little later and noticed that my teeth werent in my mouth.  When the nurse flushed what was in the cup at  the same time my teeth got flushed along with it.  I was hysterical and the nurse acted like it was nothing and told me to calm down and go back to sleep and didn't do a thing about it. I will NEVER go back to that hospital if I can help it.< /text>

<Review>I agree, this is the worst hospital in all of California. Even friends I know from both Yuba City and Marysville said "Rideout Hospital? More like Rideout Hellhole." But my story was when I spent an overnighter on the beginning of my Thanksgiving break from school which was on Monday November 23rd 2015. This all happened when me and my Dad used to live at my brother's house. But I was depressed the night I was there because my Mom was selfish by keeping my dog from me at her house which he is not her dog, did not adopt him and just wasn't fair. But that night at my brother's house I was wanting to overdose on all my medications when the only pill I ever swallow was 1 acne pill that cures zits on my face and body. They took my meds from me and both called 911. When they showed up, they talked to all 3 of us for a while, then I went to Rideout by ambulance. And as much as I told them I swear I did not swallow anything else but one pill that cures acne, they didn't believe me and they didn't want to. But when I got to the hospital by ambulance and I finally settled down on the bed, I was immediately starting to watch TV. Then later they shut the TV off on me because they were like it's too loud and it was waking everybody up. It wasn't even close to being loud for even patients nearby me to hear the volume. I don't know how even the nurses heard  the TV by the desk their all at. The only way I should've  heard the volume was where the volume is on the remote, and having it right by ear. Then when they shut it off I said to myself "Oh great, there goes my other enjoyments of entertainment." Then an hour later, I wanted get up just to go to the bathroom. Then as I stood up, one of the guy nurses and one security guard came over and started grabbing my shoulders, pressing down on me to keep me from allowed to stand up because they think I was gonna either hide from them in the bathroom or even try to run out of the hospital. And I wasn't planning on doing any of that. I was only gonna go to the bathroom, wash my hands, and go back to lay down on the bed. But they didn't believe me. As they were trying to start a fight with me, I told them "Get your hands off of me, right now." Then I brushed the guy nurse's hand off of me, or at least he so-called "punched him" which is not true and never was. Then they both wrestle me to ground and tie up on the bed for nothing at all. At least they finally untied later, after 30 minutes of hell on being tied for nothing. Oh well, they finally believed me and let me go do my business.
Skipping everything else, I never got to leave until 5:00 AM the next day which was Tuesday November 24th.
But at least its now June and I have my dog with me too and I'm over depression as well. But now my dog is no longer my mother's concern.
But yup. I agree 100% with everybody in all of Yuba/Sutter County, don't ever go to this hospital. Its full of Nurses and Security Guards that are non-believers, no reason interrogators, biggest liars and are just plain abusive to their patients.
Even my Dad drove my sister there a few months ago because she had some kind of flu that we thought was pretty serious. Luckily it was nothing. But when they were there, they were waiting for a long time just to speak with somebody to see what's going on with my sister. Minutes later my Dad asked "Can you please tell me what's wrong with my daughter?"
Female Nurse: Sorry, your gonna have to wait like everyone else.
But later never came and no one ever did see what was up with my sister. Then she asked "Dad, can we just leave now?" And my Dad and sister just walked out. But she's all better now and as said, her visit was a few months ago.
I hope this place somehow loses money or something or even they get sentenced to prison.
That's right, up yours Rideout.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<rate>1</rate><Text>This hospital is horrible. Took my husband Monday 2:00am (11/11/13) to ER with abdominal and chest pain. Took him back did an EKG (normal)...had to admit it. They believed he had pancreatitis and said he should be better within the next day or two. However he became worse. His pancreas was back to normal. He still had horrible abdominal pains. They said they believed he had an infection and still to this day, they never found out what it was. And his eyes became yellow on that FRIDAY. They took blood for hepatitis which blew my mind cause I believed they should have done that when they did a whole panel in the ER. Also during this week his IV came out TWICE...the first time while he was sleeping and took forever for someone to come. Second time after waiting to take a CAT scan all day they start putting dye in him and it was too much pressure and his IV popped out and got blood and fluids everywhere. So he had to wait again. I found out after 4 days of him being there they NEVER took a urine culture. Which is another thing that should have been done in the ER. I had to request one because my husband said his urine was very dark and he thought there was blood there. Then to top it off NOT all the staff but there were some that were very rude. It felt like they didn't want to be there, find another career then. My hubby TOLD THEM he believed it was the medicine he was getting a bad reaction from. They changed it and he got his pain away. Still has a high WBC but released him with antibiotics. Their excuse....he's a type 2 diabetic...REALLY. I tried getting him transfer to Gridley...which was very friendly, held back because we would wait on the certain test results then they would screw up something then my husband was afraid of transfer because of insurance. Finally released 11/18/13...day I guess state department of Health was coming. Will be getting in contact with them too. I felt this hospital found pancreatitis and stuck with that. Did not do standard routine of tests and which made my husband become more sick and stay there even longer. I would not go to this hospital even if I had just a broken toe.</Text><username>Melinda Wood< /username>< pics>

I ordered 1 of a few samples that I was interested in as I expressed being interested in a new vendor supply to provide my company with a large (100s at 1 time) quantity of inventory but 1st wanted to test out the product. 2 weeks passed no product. No tracking number. So I called back and left a message several times but no return call. Today I called and Tony picked up finally. I explained that I've been waiting and calling but no communication or product. He then went on to say he doesn't know who I am because I didn't order online. I provided my name and form of payment as that's all I had to identify the transaction.  I stated that he sent me an invoice through PayPal and how could he not remember the business practices that he in fact used. I immediately asked for a refund and he said he would send it and HUNG UP ON ME. Horrible service on top of HIS MISTAKE. I CALLED BACK and recorded the call to be sure that he admitted fault and confirmed the refund amount. Mind you I never provided an order number and he told me the correct amount and said he sent the refund. No apologies. And hung up again...sad day when business owners are like this. Spend your money where common respect is given and great service is apart ofbthe deal.</Review>< pictures>

I felt like I was in a candy store! Helmets, flight suits, vintage Russian, Swedish, French, Italian and American apparel from undershirts to commemoration jackets. I saw boots too. Amazing place.< /Text>

<Text>RDD USA had exactly what I was looking for and their customer service was top notch!  Even during their busiest time with this current crisis, they were able to deliver in record time and sent communications every step of the way.  I will definitely be buying from them again.

<rating>5< /rating><text>I ordered a mask from one of RDD’s subsidiaries but chose too small a size and was instructed to ship it back for a larger replacement. The subsidiary never ended up getting me the right size, but I called rdd themselves and they, specifically Nelta, set the issue straight right away and priority mailed me the mask same day. Should get here in a couple days, and the small mask I had was in great shape with a sealed filter so I have no doubt the replacement ones gonna be in similar condition.< /text><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2c7dfcedbac5b:0x1e56999155d66d89<//Gmap_id></record>

I haven't been to the us before and I like looking up army stores I am in Canada and I am with Royal Canadian army cadet program and I have been trying to find old army cadet stuff back to my core I found old battle dress tunic on eBay and was thinking is there any Canadian army cadet stuff at your store or any others  because are cadets do exchanges at summer camp and some of your American cadet have return home with some of our old badges and uniform parts that they got from the stores on some of our old world war 2 military training base that we used in the summer for our summer camps<//Text>

<Review>A somewhat small store, and a bit hard to find the entrance at first glance, however they had a very good variety of gear from several countries, and even some unusual things (I found an unused American body bag) and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful.

<Text>I ordered from these guys online.
The initial contact from the company after ordering said I'd receive a shipping notice and tracking number. These were never sent.  Questions regarding my order were not responded to.

I opened up a Paypal case after a week, and the item arrived the next day. It had taken them five days to pack and send it out.
Fortunately the item was good, but the service left something to be desired... definitely not at the level I'm accustomed to in 2015/16.</Text>< Pics>

Slow shipping seems to be the biggest problem for this business. But every product I received was in excellent condition IMO. I had a problem at first with my order but I contacted them and everything was fixed. Bottom line, good clothes for good price but it might take a little while to get to you.< /text>

Slowest shipping department around, its insane. They have good stuff at decent prices. but their shipping department is a crapshoot. You never know when its going to ship, let alone get it. They will send you a email saying it shipped with a tracking number, but it never actually ships. Then you call and they just say 7-10 days to ship, what the hell, what kind of business takes that long to ship a basic order. You can place two orders and you will get the 2nd order before the 1st one even ships, makes you scratch your head. I would order more from this company, but you just never know how long its going to take, I would rather pay more somewhere else and get my items a week earlier.< /text>

<Review>I'm Israeli and I've dealt with Israelis and Israeli companies; it isn't like dealing with Americans. It's like pulling teeth just to get a reply to an email, much less asking for a favor.

Recently I ordered a pair of hot temperature boots and my specific size wasn't listed on the website. I went ahead and ordered the next closest size in the hopes that I'd get lucky in terms of a comfortable fit.

I made a small note in my order and asked if they happened to have a rogue size 10.5 Regular that this would be preferable. Much to my surprise, they had a pair in my size and I'm a happy camper. The price was nice, too!

Todah rabah, chevrai!

Pretty terrible QA and shipping time. I haven't been in the store physically but I imagine picking things off the rack takes the employees out of the equation. Seems like this is a constant problem from other reviews.</Text>

Great selection of craft beers.   Want some Pliny the Elder?  This is your place.  Modern Times?  Got it!  Inland Empire Brewing? Done.  Euryale? Yep.  Goose Island Bourbon County? Got that too!   So yeah, you can get local and national craft brews, so it is definitely worth visiting.<//text>

<Text>The selection is pretty good but the lack of organization makes it kind of hard to find things sometimes. It always smells like incense too which gives me a headache while I'm in their, FYI if you're sensitive to smells. But over all a lot of cool and different craft beer and they usually have the regular large pack beers if you're looking for that. Service is nice< /Text><Resp>None</Resp>< pics>

They jack up the prices on most bottles and craft beer, but have a decent selection.  The owner is trying to expand the selection, but frequently runs out of good brews.  Located near a bus station so a lot of homeless and local beggars will sit outside in the parking lot and hit you up for change on your way out.  If you can, go to a better place for craft beer, wine, or spirits.</review>< user>

Check engine light came on in the middle of a road trip, made a quick stop at this location for an oil change and check up. Staff were friendly and helpful, quick and professional. I was back on the road in no time, didn’t even get off track.< /review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>First time visiting this business. They were very fast, efficient, and professional. I’ve been going to another “quick lube” business (the red one) for over 15 years and these guys exhibited a work ethic that completely blows the red place away. They earned my future business. Great job guys, see you in 5000 miles.< /Text>< pics>

This was my 3rd time coming to this location. I was promptly greeted with a smile. The service manager inside was prompt to give me instruction to comply with Covid 19 regulations.  Other services were offered/suggested in a Friendly manner. I didn't feel pressured. My car service was completed in less time than I was told it would take. Everyone was professional and made me feel important. I will definitely return and will tell others about the excellent customer service at the Herndon/Polk location.<//review>

The entire staff at my location have been nothing less than top notch! Never ever have I been disappointed or encountered a bad experience in the 8 years or more of coming here. My location is the best!  This shop has phenomenal team who treats you how you wish to be treated, with respect.  They work together like a well oiled machine, in sync with each other. It's impressive! The fellows are always friendly and efficient. They are always honest and never trick you like so many other car shops do. I feel the greatness of this place is due to the manager. He's been there for many years, and I see how the community respects him and trusts in him, just as I do. He runs a good honest business. This is one of the last few quality places left in Fresno. I sincerely LOVE my Jiffy Lube!!!!

Always great service from the team off of Herndon and Polk. They are quick and efficient and try and give me the best deal possible. I love that they do a quick road trip assessment checking my lights, wipers, fluids and tires. They support health care workers and offer discounts. I have taken multiple cars to them and always refer friends and family to jiffy lube.< /review>

This place is awesome ! I went in just for an oil change and they give 50% off for healthcare workers, then broke down with me the different things I needed to check out but did not try to up sell , there are a lot of things I didn’t know about my car and they were very helpful explaining so I understand . they are very quick and actually care about you and your car and are very nice welcoming people with reasonable prices and they always have discounts ! I will definitely be coming here from now on .</Review>

In the midst of virus concerns all measures of protection were in place.

We know the Oregon operators very well, their $22.99 offer is not the same as our $100 that you suggest, that's comparing conventional to synthetic oil, which is the largest variance. We offer a $49.99, $74.99 and then $99.99 full synthetic service. With our coupons, we are anywhere from $10-15 dollars higher then them, due to the fact we have higher overall business costs. You are correct, we are higher, but I want to be transparent and fair here, as our cost of doing business in California is much greater than Oregon. They are fine people and operators as well. I could not find your name in our customer database the past 7 days at this location, was it under a different name and or much early date? Can you please email me your invoice information, so I can research your service please. My direct email is mattg @ jiffylubeca.com (no spaces in the email address) Thanks, have a nice day - Matt"}</response>< Name>

After declining then $10 off was mentioned. What a joke, first time here I paid $45 which was to high but really to drain and refill oil?? Don’t fall for it.<//Review>< gmapID>

While the timeliness of service was great and convenient, and they seemed to want to make me feel appreciated, it got me upset that during the oil change and "thorough" check of my vehicle, they conveniently claimed to find that some of my rear lights were out and I could have them replaced for a fee ... I have a sensor for said lights and it hadn't gone off. I didn't argue, just said I'd take care of it myself and thanked them for their service - once I left, I checked, and the lights were working fine. Needless to say I won't be back. When you have your vehicle serviced, you want to feel a sense of trust, which is what makes you return to the same place, but when you know you're being blatantly lied to just to make a few extra dollars, it's disappointing.< /Text>

< review>
I go  to Jiffy Lube about twice a month. I take advantage of the free top off service. The oil changes went up quite a bit, but it's still worth the money because of the top off service. I highly recommend the Jiffy Lube on Blackstone near Dakota.< /review>

They really don't listen to customers after I warned them about drain plug. And they are not jiffy expect 40 min oil changes and if they are a little busy and I mean a little it's up to 1.5 hours.  Your better off anywhere else for an oil change even Walmart is better.< /Text>< Pics>

< Review>
Best customer service I've had in a long time. Today I was dropping off my car while I was getting my nails done at River Nails in the same shopping center. It was a little rainy out and the manager or owner, (I think,) offered me a ride across the parking lot! I said it was okay but thanked him. When my car was done he drove it to the nail place and gave me my keys! How thoughtful! Definitely going here from now on.<//Review>

They don't try to pressure you into anything, not to say that they won't suggest things, like most places do. They also give recommendations for work that they don't do at their shop for other local places.</Text>< pictures>

<rating>5</rating><Review>Great for emergency oil changes during long road trips. Since my drive from San Bernardino to Yuba City was planned last minute, I didn't really had time to change the oil on my 2016 Nissan Rogue. Synthetic oil is a bit more durable than regular oil, so I decided to change it somewhere halfway during the trip. The oil and filter maintenance reminder light came on as soon as I entered Fresno, which was the perfect place. The Jiffy Lube was right off Hwy 99 next to a Chevron gas station. In less than 15 minutes the oil and filter where changed & I was back on my way north to Yuba City.

Conveniently Located, Great Customer Service, & Fast Work.</Review>< pictures>

<text>Friendly, Fast, competitive pricing.

I would recommend jiffy lube at this location for several reasons. If you are pressed for time, this is the place for you they are efficient, dedicated professionals that are very service oriented.
The site Mgr. Stephen An fthas built a fantastic team.
I will be using this Jiffy Lube for all my maintehance arerequirements . That is 5

vehicles and climbing

I used to like coming here when it opened but now it's like a mini Wal-Mart dirty long lines and people who don't know how to clean or watch their kid's. But the employees are always friendly<//Text>

<Review>I’m so sad that this location closed already! Due to yearly quota not being met. I used to go there at least 3 times a week. It was a conviently located facility where I could get anything from milk to make up to cleaning supplies and even clothes too. Guess Wal Mart down the street is what Pushed them out of this Neighborhood.<//Review>< user_name>

<Time>1569003416982< /Time><Rating>1</Rating><review>BEWARE  DO NOT USE THIS  PLACE.....
So my partner  accidentally booked this place. we only saw, the review's  after...  stories of bed bugs, cockroaches, Unsecure  rooms and people living on-site  as  permanent residents  were plentiful. we thought  we would still give it a chance. Upon arriving  the town seemed pretty desolate, isolated and forgotten. felt like being in a time warp. However It had a certain charm.

All seemed well that's until we noticed  no additional latch or secondary  lock on the door. The window in the bath room was unsecure and faced a liquor store that was open most of the night.we had to improvise  further security measures. But even after  all that   we still gave it a chance.

But late at night, as we tried to sleep we noticed...  bed bugs on the  mattress and inaddition  my partner  found cockroaches  in the  bathroom crawling all over our toothbrushes 😡.It  being midnight we decided to sleep  in our  car rental.  How are places like these still  allowed to do business  on booking...?? poor tourist  being subjected to  third world like treatment. I never had this issue in india. Shame  on you booking.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPiZ5yI9cVvXYM41oCBmECBTTTrX_Tb-PLagK7d=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdq1_I54zb5YvGXi1lzK3VSyDvB7EosUlLUs-U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcV1Nk8mdkHXgX8X2Pf5QtBV6k9bXqSx-Vb_E1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipML7rwaTxv1YIbyXMFniA-p18hJIZ6GTRcFzjjp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXBEqYzskiPzxgLLOynr3ozHnV3f7Z9ZTzxtNO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<text>No heat, AC. hot water hit and miss. Mostly none. Bugs, Bugs, Bugs. Loud music with heavy bass 24/7
Original carpet. Musty smelling room. Roof leaks like a sift. This motel or whatever it is, should be demolished. A real dive.<//text><date>1575601141925<//date>< Pics>

<review>Room was dirty.  No pen & paper.  No instructions, rules or info about motel or surrounding area.  Office locked with written instructions on door telling how many times to ring the doorbell, depending on why you are there.  Greeted with an angry manager, yelling at me because I didn't wait long enough for him, before I began to walk away.  I had prepaid reservations or I would have kept on walking.  I relunctantly went back to the office to ask for a receipt, internet password and cleaning product.  I was greeted again by the angry manager that provided me with the password and a hand written receipt from a generic receipt book, without the motel name or info.  I was not surprised when he told me he had no cleaning products and no pen that I could use in my room.  I can't be sure, but I think most of the odd characters around there were living there.  There's plenty more I could complain about, but this should give one a good idea of my experience.  Maybe because it was one of those last minute deals.  I would not recommend this place.<//review>< userid>

Clean, comfortable and convenient describes this place. I met the coolest guy on the whole trip "I assume Tom by reading the reviews". Took my wife and infant in for the night rested up and kept a good memorable experience. Thanks guys, manager, cleaning staff and the pple staying there.
I couldn't have made it another minute on the road 5hat night and I called in, no rez and the guy put us up without the nickel and dime.
This was the only non corporate hotel on the whole trip from Cleveland to Bakersfield and I would choose it anytime for the next run!!!

Thanks guys EXCELLENT SERVICE!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

One u have to read hand written instruction for u to ring the bell of front office during the day. Then there is no inside lock on door.   Then after leaving air on for 4hrs the room was still hot and the manger  told me we could ck out tomm morning. The pool had no water in it and the worst there was mouse dropping on the floor in room where the mamger said it was bugs but they didnt move.  We ck out after 4hrs. Needs to be shut down. Older lady seen us with kids and ask if we had any weed. Not a place to stay unless u homeless<//Text>

This is definitely a budget place. Having said that, our room was recently renovated with new flooring, paint, and a completely redone bathroom. Free wifi wasn't bad from our room, which was close to the office.</text>

If you like thin walls and armies of cockroaches in the bathroom then you will be right at home. The manager was perfectly nice and the room was cleanish and passably maintained, but the bugs and the noise make this a complete pass.<//text>

<Time>1487614902804</Time><text>More of a halfway house than a hotel. Rundown hotel in a depressing shell of a town that might have been many many years ago. Bed has to be at least 30 years old. Original carpeting (not a good thing) and unintended vintage tangerine colored bathtub. I slept with only a sheet and upon close investigation did not find any evidence of bedbugs. The comforter automatically goes on the floor. Wore shoes to bathroom. Did not use towels. Just ick all around. This motel has to be removed from listings. It seems to be a home for down on their luck locals and appears to be rented out by the hour.</text></record></dataset><record>

<text>I will never stay here again! The outside looks like a crackhead hotel. There is a pool with no water with a broken run downed fence. I opened the door to see an ok furnished room, but as I looked down a cocaroch ran passed me. The bathroom wasn't cleaned well, and there was old coffee still inside the maker. Grosss!!! I know this city isn't great or attractive at all, but when you have out of towners come at least have you're motels in decent shape, people dont stay here!< /text>< gmapID>

BEDBUGS. Found hordes of these little terrors in the mattress, left immediately. Hotel was impossible to get in touch with the night of the problem, but I was able to get money refunded the next day. Stay away.<//Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) we stayed here one night having made the stop from Los Angeles to the Grand Canyon. It's a cheap motel, it had all the features we were looking for, parking in front of the room, I could see the car from the window, clean, comfortable bed. Rarity for the area, the wooden palquet instead of the mouquet. Kit for making coffee and tea. Great

abbiamo soggiornato qui una notte avendo fatto tappa da Los Angeles al Gran Canyon. E' un motel economico , aveva tutte le caratteristiche che cercavamo, posteggio di fronte alla camera, potevo vedere l'auto dalla finestra, pulito, letto stra-comodo. Rarità per la zona, il palquet in legno al posto della mouquet. Kit per fare il caffè ed il the. Ottimo<//text>< Pics>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Terrible receptionist management.
We were attended by a man connected to an oxygen machine, without any education. He gave us two keys to different rooms both occupied. Imagine the surprise. The third key did not open the door. He did not apologize at any time.
The room was clean the part that looked but under the beds there was a lot of dirt.
The tub had live bugs.
The air conditioning a scandalous noise.
The mattress was stained like rust.
I am surprised that booking allows advertising to this type of establishments ....

(Original)
Pésima gestión de recepcionista.
Nos atendió un señor conectado a una máquina de oxígeno, sin ninguna educación. Nos dio dos llaves de habitaciones diferentes ambas ocupadas. Imaginen la sorpresa. La tercera llave no abría la puerta. No se disculpó en ningún momento.
La habitación estaba limpia la parte que se veía pero debajo de la camas había mucha suciedad.
La bañera tenía bichos vivos.
El aire acondicionado un ruido escandaloso.
El colchón estaba manchado como de óxido.
Me sorprende que booking permita anunciarse a este tipo de establecimientos....</Text><username>Yolanda A.< /username><GmapID>0x80ce2371b9d6a98f:0x51ecbd7753d0db5e<//GmapID>< Response>

<review>Love they Are a block away and an easy trip, and that they have propane. But I feel like they might “fair” better if they lowered the prices of the fresh veggies and dairy that always looks like it’s seen better days. Maybe they would sell quicker, instead of sitting there going bad because they are so expensive? Also maybe be open the hours you say you’ll be open? Ive gone there countless times 15-45 minutes before 10:00 pm, the posted closing time, and was so disappointed they were closed. Just a couple thoughts. I’m no business major tho.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<review>I love the customer service. If you're looking for DRY items or CANNED goods. You should be OK. Keep in mind these are convenient store prices so it's a bit more expensive. There freezer bunkers DO NOT WORK. Nothing is frozen in the ice cream section (main reason I went in today with it being 100°) the meat is old and so are the cakes you can tell upon appearance.  It could be because of the pandemic though. Like I said. The customer service is great.<//review>< pictures>

Staff is the best around. I'm disabled and I went there to get a heavy item "30 pack Bud" I was carrying it while on crutches.  The older gentleman that works there came and took it it from me. After he rang me up he told the other customers to give him a minute and he took it to my car for me. I just moved to Vacaville 3 months ago after my accident and the place is down the street. Loyal customer from now on.<//Review>

A truly old school grocery store that reminds me of shopping with my grandma. Some really good deals if you don't mind looking around and the cigarettes are the cheapest in town by far.< /Text>

<Text>As soon as I walked in this store, I was greeted by a putrid, moldy smell (like old meat). Most of the food didn't look fresh. The interior of the store was dirty. However, the exterior/parking lot was clean and the staff was extremely friendly. But that's about all that's going for this place. Overall, this is not a very good store to shop at and I would seriously advise staying away unless you absolutely need something from here.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<date>1522424840909<//date><Review>Sure, some of the produce is less than fresh, but Food Fair is a neighborhood fixture in North Vacaville. It's been around for ages. They're open 365 days a year, so if you forget halfway through Thanksgiving that you forgot Aunt Sally's secret ingredient in the stuffing, they're going to be there for you. You can pick up just about any alcohol there, too. One of the better grocery store liquor departments in town.
I don't know who owns the entire Glenbrook Center where Food Fair is located, but every morning, without exception, there are people out there picking up trash and sweeping the lot. They do not stop until the entire facility is spotless. It's a detail that likely goes overlooked by most of us, but I drive by every morning and see the care that goes into making sure this lot is always clean.< /Review>< Resp>

Vegetables are not so fresh and are so expensive. But if you don't have any choice and forgot something, you can buy few things from here. Staffs are very friendly though.< /review>

<Review>The guys on the truck were great! Would rather have been able to donate my furniture pieces, but after COVID19, donation centers are no longer taking large items. Very nice to know that the Junk Kings do their best to recycle these larger items to keep them out of a landfill.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>From the time we looked online for a quote, they were extremely responsive and communicative. I got texts letting me know what our window for the service would be and that we would get a text on the day of about 20-30 minutes prior to arrival. Our window was 9am to 11am and sure enough, at about 5 minutes to 9 I got a call that they were 20 minutes away. They showed up on time, were extremely polite, knowledgeable, and respectful, they gave me a confirmed quote upon looking at the “junk”, and then they got to work! It took about 10 minutes, and I paid by credit card and was able to leave a tip on the card (thank GOODNESS, as I had no cash on me!!), and were on their way! SO easy, and such a pleasant experience. I highly recommend.<//Text>< Pictures>

The two gentlemen who showed up assessed the situation, assigned a reasonable price for the effort, and performed the service expediently. This is the second time I have engaged Junk King and will definitely hire them for future needs! They are so much more reliable and reasonable than their competitors.< /Review>

It was a big job, most of the furniture in a 2-bedroom apartment since I was moving to a furnished place and too lazy to sell all of it. Took them about 2 hours and 15 minutes to clear it out, barely fit in their one truck, but it did.  They were courteous and friendly. I’d certainly use the company again.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x8085b4fb21003425:0x9f2af62fcfafe7ad</GmapID></record>

Great service. They were very easy to book, came on time (even early), called before arriving, and we were able to get a great price for our mattress, boxspring, and lots and lots of moving boxes. I would definitely recommend their service and will use them again when needed.< /review>

We called for a quote and information. They had an opening to give a free quote and possible pickup if we accepted the quote the next day. Our time slot was for the afternoon, but they called us "running early" would we like them to come by in 20 minutes? They came on time. Skyler and Wilson were polite, efficient and professional! We will be calling again when we need to get rid of more stuff. Very Happy with their service!</review>

I was very satisfied with the whole experience having our playscape taken apart and removed.
Matthew was on time, very personable, professional and did the whole project within one hour. !

We will be moving the 1st of the year and will be needing more things removed and we will definitely be calling Junk King to come help us again.

Nice work Junk King !!

They called to advise us that they were running late, they did arrive at the new time. Quickly loaded the junk we had and answered a few questions we had. We were well satisfied.<//Text>

Friendly, affordable and super convenient. If you have a garage that you want emptied or left over construction remnants or yard waste – do not hesitate calling Junk King for an estimate. By far the most reasonable option we found. Professional and on time! Woo hoo!!<//Review>

I am so happy! I booked online and picked Junk King because their website let me get an accurate idea of what my cleanup would cost.
The communication from the driver was excellent, the guys arrive on time and were friendly, polite and efficient. Will definitely use them again should the need arise!</Text>

The guys called before the appointment to confirm-showed up on time and gave me a fair estimate for removal. They were completely done in less than an hour. I highly recommend them!<//review>

This was the second time I called these guys to pick up my junk since I am buying stuff for my home and of course there is a lot of empty boxes to get rid off. I have called them a second time because the first time they were very reasonable and professionals. Last time they work very hard for at least 2 hours and picked up very heavy and huge plant and flower pots, in addition of other heavy stuff......well this time they barely stay half an hour to pick up some empty boxes and they end up charging me $550 ! (Last time was $400) when I asked them the reason why they charge me so much they replied that it was the price , of not they were going to unpack the truck and left me everything outside. I ended up paying but I called their manager to complaint about it and the person in charge told us that he was going to call us back Monday am. Monday AM, my sister called them back from her job and left several voice messages and they never called her back.
My advice: always arrange the price before they start hauling. Of course my sister will never call them again to work for her company. Not professional at all. I imagine that they are “desperate” for money. But they are not very smart business oriented. They lost 2 clients for $100.</Review>

Removal of a giant TV from the ‘90s (50”x46”x26”—at least a 200lbs) that we affectionately called “the elephant.” They were available right away, came on time, and hauled that thing up 9 stairs!  Super nice and professional. Cost was 1/3 of that quoted by the only other company that got back to us/was willing to come take it. Glad to have “the elephant” out of our house!</text>

I work for a company that upholds the utmost professionalism and integrity so I can be a bit picky at times about companies I work with. My husband and myself spent the better part of a week moving our home and his gym equipment ourselves. It was not fun. We ended up with a garbage pile of a mattress and misc things. I set my appointment online just before midnight for Noon the next day. I got an email confirmation the guys called when on the way and when Ian and Skyler showed up they asked if I had a quote, provided me with a great one, got right to work and had the pile gone in a matter of minutes. They were both professional, kind and efficient. They saved me from a dump run! These guys now have a client for life in me!< /Review>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Review>I was told I would receive an estimate prior to removal of my “junk.” I did. 2 guys showed up and dude number one was astonished at how small the load to be hauled was. It was a tiny 3 piece sectional couch ( less than 85” long if pieced together) and very light. “WOW! That’s a lot smaller and easier than I thought it would be.” I explained that I would have taken it to the dump myself except that I couldn’t lift one of the pieces on my own. “Oh the dump would charge you 25 per piece,” he said. This led me to assume that he believed (as I did) that 75 would be a lot to discard of such a small item. “Well you’re not gonna charge me per piece, are you?” I asked jokingly. He then told me that the minimum was $85 to haul anything. My stomach sunk a bit at this figure as I considered the dump in the back of my mind. And then in the next breath, dude says “but I’m gonna charge you 99.”

I accepted because I was in a position where I had to. But dude had the gall to tell me how small and easy this job was, and then charge me almost 20% more than the “minimum.” These guys literally lifted all the pieces piled on top of each other and had it in the truck in under a minute. $99.

Disappointing to say least. But they were fast and efficient!</Review>< pictures>

It was hot and muggy, the kind of East Coast weather we never have here and the guys were clear about their arrival communication, on time, kind, kept focused with their work and were in and out of here with one of those old, way too heavy, floppy king size mattresses like it was a breeze. Nicely done guys!</Review>

Excellent service.  I made the appointment online and it was very simple.
They came the next day between the window I requested.
They called and let me know when they would arrive.
Very nice workers arrived and removed my doors and electronics.
It was super easy and fast.< /Text>

Very punctual. They called before coming out to let me know they were ready. John helped and give me some information on things in the future that I need to get rid of. Was very helpful and friendly. Since it was the first time as a customer I get them a four star.Keep up the good work.<//Review>

They are not cheap although I have nothing to compare with so the price may be right on. They are punctual, responsive, neat and fast. The estimate was one and a half trucks and they squeezed it all into one, saving me a lot of money. Love these guys and I seldom write reviews.< /text>

The junk king gentlemen were excellent.  I could not move things due to health issues so I just told and pointed to items which were behind boxes that needed to be taken and stay. They accomadated the dog because it is an escape artist the dog that is. They were moving all the time. Everything was moved in an hour which were mattress, recliners. Old beds and junk. They wore masks and so very nice<//review>

Great company! Hector was on time and even called to check in prior to showing up. He and Mateo worked very fast. They were professional. The cost was way more than I expected but it was yardwaste from two fallen trees so there was a large volume of debris. The cost in the end is worth that stuff being hauled away! I'd use Junk Kings again.<//text>

<Review>The crew was running a little behind but no big deal. When they arrived, they were very pleaseant and professional.  The price quoted was what I was expecting and I was happy to have it removed and hauled away at one-time without all the back and forth trips to the dump. If you have a lot of miscellaneous items to get rid of and don’t want to deal with multiple trips to the dump I would consider Junk King as an option.</Review><rating>4</rating>< userid>

Junk King is the way to go for all our hauling needs. Prompt, efficient and reasonably priced. They remove all the need to decide which kind of debris to separate and which type of recyclng to put where. And the best part is not having to deal with the debris box rental companies with all their rules and confusing pricing systems<//text>

I took two hours off from work to meet Junk King at my house and at the end of the two hour window they called and said they couldn't make it. I had to return to work and wasted two hours of work time. Poorly organized. I can't recommend them.< /Text>

Even though I live in Sonoma County I call the Junk King of Marin for all my removal needs. Within 24hrs my junk is removed! I've been using them for 5yrs now and they're great!< /review>

<Text>Nice guys, but hate and switch. I called and asked what the cost was for a ca king matress and foam topper. The lady quoted me 85.00. Book online and get a 20.00 discount. Booked Online and when the guys showed up the price was $115.00. I said the lady quoted 85.00 and they honored the price. No online discount. Other than that it worked out ok.<//Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

They came, they saw, they gave me an estimate, they filled up their truck (to the top), and they gave me a good price. They were quick and courteous. We couldn’t be more pleased. Highly recommended.</Text>

The two guys that came out were awesome!!! They were able to get a huge hideabed couch out that was in our home for over 40 years. Our home is older so it has narrow doors and hallways, they were able to move everything out no problem. The two guys were so nice, fast and friendly and the price was good. Definitely recommend them!!!<//review>

These guys were great! They showed up exactly when they said they would and carried everything off for a reasonable price. A lot less than if I had gotten a dumpster from my garbage company. And they sorted out anything that had value and could be donated. It enabled us to do some great de-cluttering! I will definitely call them again!< /Review>

Wonderful service.  Making an appointment was effortless, and the two men that showed up were incredible.  Within minutes they had removed my couch. They were polite and professional.  They called 15 minutes prior to arriving to let me know they were almost here. I highly recommend them and their service.</review>

<review>The guys got here right on time. My driveway was full of so much stuff, including dirt, rocks, metal and wood, and they got it all into their truck in less than 1/2 hour. They were respectful, cheerful, and extremely hard working. I will definitely call them again. Furthermore I think the price was very fair.<//review></record>

<rating>5<//rating><review>Called their 888 number and made an appointment for the next business day. The person I spoke to was gracious and helpful and she gave me a time window of 10am-noon, promising a phone call 15 minutes before they arrived. PLUS, there was a $20 coupon if you booked online and they honored it anyway.
They actually called at 925am and asked if they could come early. Two super-nice guys showed up at 940, loaded my old sofa on their truck, did a CC charge on their phone and were gone in a matter of minutes.
Couldn't have been better.
I will use these guys again.<//review>< Pictures>

Hector was right on time. A total gentleman. Worked miracles getting everything into the truck. And the price was right. They were here and gone in 60 minutes flat.
I will never use another junk/hauling service again.
Junk King For Life!
Thank you!!!!<//review>

Jordan and his team did a great job cleaning out and removing the sheds I had in my backyard.  They were on time and were very nice gentlemen and hard workers.  Something that is rare these days.  Very fair price.  I will definitely use them again if I ever need more junk removed.  Thank you Junk King!</Text>

We had a load of "stuff" to get rid of in preparation for an upcoming move and responsibly dealing with e-waste, recycling, and outright dumping was getting overwhelming. I'm so glad I contacted Junk King rather than hauling it out to the dump on moving morning. Their services were fast, professional, and very reasonably priced. Thanks for saving us half a day and a load of hassle!<//Text>< pictures>

The communicated often and did what they said they would do at the price they quoted. They had Some issues with their trucks on the day they we’re to come and they communicated swiftly to see how to best rearrange servicing my needs with the need for adjusting their schedule.
They showed up just as agreed, called first, and were pleasant and swift with their work.
They were fantastic.< /Text>< pictures>

I contacted them through Yelp, and they communicated back right away. Two young pleasant men came and offered a compatible price, and got to the job right away. They were so quick and hauled away some extras for me. I would def use them again.</Review>

The Junk King crew was awesome. Getting an estimate was easy and quick. Jordan and his crew came in on time, worked fast and thorough, they were great at removing things as directed, and it was a MESS! Would definitely recommend them to anyone!< /Text>

I just scheduled my 3rd pick up with Junk King Marin! This company is great! First time I used them, Matt came out himself. I was super impressed with this guy! So friendly and out going! I was moving and had to down size. My husband was out of town at the time and I was there with my sister and kids when he came. He gave me a great price. I was expecting to pay a lot more than what I actually paid. He was also very honest with me. He came across something I was throwing out that he felt had value and  he mentioned it to me. I told him that I had no interest in it but if he wanted it then he was welcome to keep it. He was thrilled and so was I. So we had them come back a few years later to pick up an old couch. Again, great experience! We recently bought new furniture and need their services again. So without hesitation, we called them to help us out! I highly recommend this company to anyone who needs anything hauled away. You will be WELL taken care of by them. I love that they are so wonderful. Its hard to find a great company like them these days! Thank you guys so much for your integrity! Keep up the great work!< /Text>

Your employees were on time, courteous, respectful and very thoughtful in handling the things that previously belonged to my deceased daughter.  They were both very kind and made the situation better then expected. Hats off to both of them as their definitely an asset to your company.</review>

Excellent service!
The crew that cleaned out my junk was super professional and did an amazing job!
We got the job done so quickly, i couldn't believe it!
The way they strategically filled the truck was great! I didn't feel taken advantage of, AT ALL!
I highly recommend Junk King and will make sure i tell everyone what a great service you offer.Thank you!< /Review>

<username>Ganna B< /username><time>1461355356491< /time><rating>5<//rating><review>There are many things that I liked about “JUNK*KING”! 1. I love their LOGO … I never had a service from Junk King before but when my friend mentioned of the name I then immediately remembered the logo on trucks on the street. So, I looked them up on “GOOGLE” and there they were with very attractive advertisement with “HIGHEST” review. 2. Setting up an appointment online was super simple, easy and legit. 3. I called to confirm my appointment; the lady who answered the phone was friendly and professional. 4. On the appointment date, I received a phone call before my scheduled time and I was notified that precisely what time they will be at my property. 5. I now believe your “Low Price Guarantee” promise; I’ve got a discount by setting up an appointment online! 6. I wasn’t there at the house and I was worried that what if they won’t remove the hot-tub if I don’t pay them first. But it was not a problem at all! “Junk*King” sent me an invoice on the very same day and I simply sent a check out to them!!! You made my life easier, so I truly appreciate that. 7. Well done gentlemen! …I can give Junk*King “Thousand” stars if there is such rating. Thank you Matt, you Rock!< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Junk King was a lifesaver. Setting up an appointment was fast and easy. The guys were super friendly and very efficient, and last but not least, the price for removing my junk was very reasonable. I'll definitely be a repeat customer as we'll be working on our fixer-upper for years to come.< /Text>

Called and you arrived the next day. The two guys who showed up were wonderful. Gave us a super reasonable estimate and then got to work right away which we didn't expect. We thought we'd have to schedule it for weeks after the estimate. They were amazing and we were so excited to find you guys. We saved a ton of money hiring you guys instead of renting a dumpster ourselves.< /review>

<text>Junk King was a life saver! We were moving out of state, and the line at the dump was too long for us to meet our moving deadline. Junk King let us leave all the items we wished to dispose of in the front yard and let us pay over the phone. We didn't need to be there while they were collecting our junk. They gave us a good rate and we made our moving deadline!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Don't bother calling anyone else, just call these guys.  They are genuinely the nicest, hardworking guys.  They charged 1/3 less than other companies we called to have our built in hot tub removed and they did the job quickly without any damage to the deck.
They are professional and organized and seem to really love what they do.

So pleased we found them!<//Text>

This is a really customer focused operation. Matt,..the owner I believe DOES NOT FAIL to assist, arrange, follow up on my projects, and I have a lot of projects. I  work for a large compaby that has many holdings and gping concerns here in Sonoma county.I can't heartily endorse a company more than I endorse this company.<//Review>

Fair price and they honored my $30 reduction for on line booking.
I will use them again.

This business was a godsend in the midst of clearing out a huge house for sale.  The fellows on the job were very pleasant, understanding and super helpful. They are quick to respond and they do their best to recycle or re-purpose as much as possible.  Much better than sending your junk to landfill.</review>

We recently moved and used Junk King instead of getting a dumpster. They were very prompt, actually called and came early. They quickly removed everything we showed them. It was much easier than doing it ourselves. They also cost less than renting a dumpster. Very pleased with their service and highly recommend them.<//Text>

Ray and Jeremy did a awesome job. I definitely recommend Junk King Marin.
The guys contacted me and arrived early. They cleaned out my mother's house very quickly.They were also the best priced. They showed up for a bid and completed the job the same day. Took a quick payment over the phone and the job was completed.

Very polite and professional young men</Text>

These guys are great!! I work for a large apartment complex where people think it's ok to dump furniture, appliances, t.v's and other stuff next to our dumpsters, which creates problems that I dont need. But one call to Junk King and the problem is solved. They are reliable, trustworthy and hardworking. I highly recommend Junk King Marin for any and all of your junk removal needs!!</review>

As a commercial property management company, we have used various trash hauling services from the local handy man, regional removal services and a few of the national companies. Junk King was new to us but we found that they have a very efficient call in process and were able to schedule the removal the very next day. Their prices are very reasonable and if you have more than a few medium sized items, their prices will be much less than what you would pay to the local trash hauler and you can be assured the items will be disposed of properly.< /text>

We had a great experience with Junk King! The communication via email was superb. All questions I had were promptly answered and very helpful. They called ahead to assess the job while another team member was unloading the truck elsewhere and were able to give me a quote then. The price was very reasonable!! They were fast and did a great job and removing our junk and debris. They left it all clean and totally cleared out! We will definitely be using them again!!</review>

The 2 guys that handled my job were professional, friendly and super fast. They called to let me know they were on their way and showed up early. They had an entire 2 car garage full of stuff as well as another upstairs room cleared out in less than 40 minutes. The price was very reasonable, less than half what another company quoted me. I am very impressed with this service. I highly recommend Junk King.</Text>

<Review>Junk King Marin was great. When another service screwed up the appointment and had to reschedule I called these guys as backup. They got here faster, were more economical, had a great attitude and loaded a barnful of junk in less than an hour. I was impressed and will definitely use their services again when the barn fills itself back up :-).<//Review>< pictures>

We've used Junk King 3 times now for home junk pick ups. It's a high quality service and the online scheduling has always worked extremely well for day-of appointments. I scheduled online at 1pm and the guys were at my house by 4pm; wow! Will use again! Liz Lloyd Akyol< /Text>

I was happy; they let me know they would be late and the owner called to apologize.  It was a very hot day, but the guys were cheerful and friendly, and got it all loaded and gone.</text>

We had three households worth of junk to dump and it was A LOT. I was afraid Junk King would show up and say that they couldn't take some of the items or that I had too much. No worries. Jacob and Rob showed up in the BIG red junk truck (very professional) and in no time had all the junk loaded and ready to go. They're prices are fair for the relief you feel seeing all that junk leave your property. I will definitely refer Junk King to my friends, family and clients in the future. Thank you again for being so friendly and helpful.< /text>

<review>I needed to move (get rid of) my giant 250 lb. Sony Triniton TV which was in my basement. This required carrying it up three flights of stairs.  The two men from Junk King arrived on time, were good natured & quick.   Also their price was very reasonable. I'll call them again if I ever need heavy moving or even simple junk hauling. Highly recommend.<//review>< time>

A great alternative to breaking your back, renting a truck, and driving it away. In the end, your savings aren't worth the effort. These guys were really great and the price was reasonable.<//Text>

If anybody is moving and needs to get rid of excess then I recommend Junk Kings. They asked to show up early and got everything done incredibly fast. They didn't charge extra for certain items and even give you discounts for booking online. Really friendly customer service  and good work ethic.</Text>

Junk King offers affordable pricing and convenience. The nice thing is you pay based on how much of the truck is used, instead of hourly labor, gas or disposal costs (which is good, because our job took much longer than I expected based on the amount of stuff to haul). They did an on-site estimate beforehand, and Jacob and his team were very thorough in cleaning out our garage and asking if we wanted to save any items that may have value.

I would especially recommend Junk King if you anticipate insects or rodents found on the job. These guys weren't afraid of some black widow spiders found in our garage.<//Text>

There is a great professionalism in Junk King. The appointment was easy to make, I received timely reminders and assurances that they had me on their schedule, and they arrived on time and were in and out - clearing my storage unit - in less than an hour. The cost was reasonable - not cheap - but a good value. It was a little difficult to get a good idea of what it would cost before they came - but there was no requirement to use their service when they come if you do not like their price. I was arranging this work from out of state, and it could not have been easier. Bravo.< /text>

I hired these folks for the first time to help me clean out my mom's home.  What a pleasant surprise it was working with all four of their workers with both trucks.  It was so very nice to work with them and looking to help save you money where ever they can.  It's the old way of doing business and they do it well!  I highly recommend using this company and I certainly will use them again.  I feel like I just made four new friends.  What ever you do Junk King, don't ever let these four guys go as their all very good hard workers!  You have a great business and keep up the good job!

Great service, professional staff, and friendly.  I'm one happy customer Junk King hauled my sofa couch from inside my home to the Junk King truck.  I didn't have to lift a finger 😃</Review>

Junk King was easy to arrange online. Promp, courteous service, and, best of all, my construction mess is gone! It would have taken me days to clean it up myself, with lots of dump runs and fees. Well worth it to call Junk King!</Text>

<Review>I LOVE this service. The crew that came out to help me were fantastic. They were so courteous, helpful, and beyond efficient. They listened, moved, broke down and compact loaded (so there was no wasted space) AND cleaned everything up when they were finished. They were very hardworking and double-checked to see if there was anything else that may need to be removed. Thank you so much for a wonderful job done in a timely manner! Almost wish I had more junk to remove. Rebecca, Santa Rosa CA</Review><Time>1498228420068< /Time><Resp>{'time': 1508817309411, 'text': 'Thank you.

We have used Junk King Marin twice, both times service has been excellent.  They are on time, very professional, helpful, courteous, and fast!  Will use again, and have recommended to our friends.

Thank you!!!!

<Text>The entire experience was so easy. I had tried hiring a guy on Craigslist and he put obstacles in my way and wouldn’t come on a Saturday. Then my friend from work referrred me to Junk King. The next day she sent me an email that you’d sent her with a $30 coupon. I went online then texted a photo of my junk and made the appt for Saturday. Your guys, Damien and Ray just left. They were kind and courteous and hardworking. Damien is very strong and both were professional and helpful. I had another front patio project that I asked them about hauling away at a future time. Ray and Damien helped me and got it all in the truck today!!!! I feel I got a great deal, and worth every cent.  Now I don’t have to worry about the second project because it’s done. And Ray and Damien emptied the soil and rock from this planter box that was real heavy to the side of my condo, not an easy task. I am very satisfied with Junk King.</Text><user>114844801754640097511< /user>< Pictures>

Great service, courteous and strong staff (I had 2 200 lb.+ Items to get rid of), best of all less expensive than me trying to load it in my trailer and haul it to the dump.</review>

The service was far above what i had expected and they two guys who helped out where a couple of the nicest and most genuine individuals I've had the please of doing business with. The communication throughout was top notch, from the first call to the reminder call day of service, and the very polite and often humorous chat during cleanup, all the way down to the high five and a handshake as they got ready to take off. They did exactly what i needed and did so in a fraction of the time it would have taken me to do it by myself. Plus they did it with a smile and genuinely seemed to be enjoying their job. Couldn't ask for more. Out where i live it has proven very hard if not impossible to locate many services that are widely available in more urban areas. Out of 9 disposal companies and dumpster rentals your service is one of only two that even offered me the help i needed. The other being Redwood Empire Disposal. However out of the two options i defiantly made the right choice, since you guys actually came out and physically helped me get rid of this mess ive been staring at for almost a year but you did it with a smile and at a price that was much better then renting a dumpster for a week. Cant thank you enough, and hope to be using your service again in the future. Ive already recomended your services to a neighbor friend of mine who has a similar pile of junk taking up both physical and even more precious mental space. Ill be sure to recommend that he requests the two gentlemen who made my day one i won't soon be forgetting. Cheers to all over at Junk King.

<Text>a man driving a lexis sedan parked in our company parking and I left him a note telling him that if continued to park in our parking locations his vehicle would be towed. He came to my office door, stuffed the note through our mail slot and cursed and yelled at me for us putting this note on his car, this is in the Petaluma location.. so buyer beware.<//Text>< name>
