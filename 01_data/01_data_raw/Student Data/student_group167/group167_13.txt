The Best. Drop the mic. End of conversation.
Neighborhood restaurant was here long before the gentrification of Hayes Valley and trendy container-shops came around. Perfection never disappoints.
Try Takeout! It arrives great, always hot and fresh.</Text>

Enjoyed my Italian meal here with a bunch of friends on a Sunday evening.  Not too busy.  Not too noisy.  But we did make a reservation beforehand.  Shared a bottle of Macchiavelli red wine.  Each had our own main course.  I had the Lasagnetta Del Borgo.  It was not what I expected.  Not the conventional layers of lasagna that you expect.  Instead it looked more like rolls of tagliatelle.  Taste was sufficiently fresh and rich.  Could do with a little more spice.  Portions decent.  Shared a tiramisu.  It was not fancy-looking but tasted good.  USD28 per pax for a group of 5.< /review>

<Review>I didn't even get the chance to eat at this place because I walked in, was waiting for around 10 minutes before someone even acknowledged that I was there, and was then told that there were no tables available (very bluntly). I wasn't given a wait time, and they didn't even ask if I wanted to make a reservation for a later time. I won't be dining here after this experience.<//Review>< resp>

I came to this place 2 times and both times I was treated really rudely by the server/owner there. She stated things like "In California the minimum percentage for the tip is 20%" and she personally checked for the tip value in there from everyone and complained about it to one of my friends that was paying less than he should, and that is just one of many examples of how people are rude in there. The red wine glasses in there were rancid both times I've been there, and I suspect that's due to how they store the wines that they use for selling glasses. So, maybe buying the whole bottle would be better.

On the brightside though, the food is usually interesting. The lasagna and the gorgonzola pizza were really good, and the decoration of the place is amazing, very rustic and beautiful.</Text>

Love this place! Just happened upon it when there was a long wait at other dinner spots right in the middle of Hayes. Lovely, casual style inside and no wait on a Friday around 8pm, but still always just about full. I liked the murals on the walls, the service was great and very fast. Best dinner prices I've found in the city and the food was very good. Highly recommend!</review>

<text>Worst experience, ok food. It seems this place only serves people who frequent it. The lady greeted everyone and even try to speak Italian to most of the people, but for some reason she gave me the cold shoulder. Never once I was asked how the meal was or anything she can bring while I carefully watched she did that to other guests. Never felt so bad eating at a restaurant this way. She was literally shoving the plates at my table and I had to reach and bring them close to me. Food is nothing special, but fettuccine was cooked perfectly. The tomato sauce was bitter, and the chicken didn't taste fresh. Avoid this place.</text></record>

Carissimo Sergio. I miss this place and your craziness. I used to come with friends every Friday night 20 years ago. As young professionals, we would save up during the week and on Friday get that weekly shot of genuine Italian taste that reminded us of our European motherland. From 8pm till late. We ended up closing the restaurant with Sergio and staff every time, singing our hearts away with the help of fermented grapes. The best memories ever in this restaurant, including some epic birthdays. This restaurant has SOUL. Ain’t for everybody. Other reviews said it and confirmed to me it has not changed much. Yes the service may not be 100% following whatever standards. But it is still a true experience. To me it is like when you live in a small village in Italy: loud, sometimes crazy, slow sometimes and you’d better be acquainted to the locals. This tiny restaurant is an institution to me, and withstood the test of time. The food is truly authentic Italian, as well as the owner. I will be back there for sure this summer with family and friends very soon, travelling back to SF from old Europe. Get ready and prepare la pasta e la grappa grande Sergio!!!!! :)<//text>

<Review>Friendly at first and the minute she (believe owner and our server) knew we were paying by credit card she became completely rude. Asked us to pay by cash and when we said couldn’t, grabbed cards off table aggressively and didn’t acknowledge us any further. They do have the signs in their window that they accept credit cards. Bad experience< /Review>< Pictures>

Family run, friendly, delicious meals, well priced and fantastic atmosphere.

Review update: changed from 5 to 3 stars due to the overall lack of consistency in the experience and food. Sometimes 5 stars, but sometimes much less.</text>

Very good veggie lasagna. Pizza was not so great (had sausage/mushroom). Service was fine, for cleanliness I would give about 3/5. Located near hayes and I wouldn’t say it was in the safest area.<//Text>

Updated March 18, 2020. After a few days stuck at home, we got takeout from here today. The fettuccine Bolognese and carbonara were exactly what we needed. They also included some warm fresh bread that was incredible. We had a small date night in and it was perfect because of this

Nice little spot that had an excellent Bolognese< /text>

This place was pretty good. I was a bit surprised our orders came out so quickly. We ordered the Bolognese and margherita pizza and they we're good, but not great. Generous 4 star. We had a good time though.</Text>

As others have said, it is an intimate restaurant. If you are one of the first, you have a chance at sitting by the window-side tables, which are preferable (for me). I went for my birthday with family two weeks back, and started with the pizza (margherita)...WOW, delicious, mouthwatering, and flavorful. Definitely one of the best, if not the best, Italian restaurants I have been to in San Francisco.<//review>

Very solid and cozy neighborhood trattoria, a little dark but romantic. Pasta was handmade and seemed to be in traditional Italian style. Not fussy. Good value for money.</review>

Average Italian food at modest prices. Quaint, but outdated interior leads to a casual atmosphere and casual service. Great bread! You can order from here on several food delivery services, recommend you enjoy your pasta at home!</review>

This is the best Italian restaurant in the city, according to me of course. The food here is like in Italy, if not best. Run by Italian family they keep the tradition going on. The food is superb, the place is cozy, friendly and you feel transported to Italy immediately. I try to go back there as often as possible and every time I walk in they great me with a smile. Not sure if they remember me, but I see them doing the same thing to all patrons. Love it! 100% recommend (expect to pay in cash, no credit cards but they have an ATM inside)< /text>

Owned by a notoriously sassy older Italian man, this place makes the very best ravioli. It's a quirky sort of Italian restaurant, the type with wrapped wine bottles on the table and murals of wine leaves on the walls, but the food is not messing around. Give this throwback a chance!</Review>

<Review>Adorable and delicious. Take a date here if you want to show them a special gem/comfort italian food spot, but not if you want to impress them with fanciness. It's rustic and kind of a hole in the wall, but it's plain and simple no frills delicious authentic Italian food at a very reasonable price. The owner will greet you, and she's fantastic.<//Review>< pics>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Hands down my favorite Italian restaurant in San Fransisco! Been coming here for many years! Great place to take someone out on a date. Place looks classy and quaint, prices are reasonable, and has that sweet Italian family ran touch you can't get at the big commercial places in SF and much more laid back than the high strung ass hats I usually have to deal with at the places in North Beach. Much closer to a freeway than the North Beach places too which was a big deal for me coming from Daly City. This place used to be cash only, but now they take Visa and MasterCard which was a nice change too! I personally recommend the lobster or artichoke ravioli, they are super yummy, but make sure you get some appetizers with any of the ravioli dishes because the portions are not that big. Wish I could clone this place and put one next to my house!<//Text>< Pics>

<text>Can't believe how much I've struggled to find a good restaurant in San Fran. Stumbled across this place as it had Gluten Free pasta options. Nicely decorated in an old, Italian style. Small but cosy. Waited 15 mins by the door before being acknowledged by any of the staff. Seemed to be invisible! Once seated ordered the GF penne with aubergine and tomato. Was ok, but undercooked and not a lot of thought seemed to go into it  but then, often GF pasta is not cooked properly in restaurants. If your in desperate need of GF pasta, it would do, but I suspect there are better options in SF. Average food and less than average service.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Without a doubt some of the most authentic Italian food I've had in SF. No need to go to North Beach when you can find delicious homemade pasta and classic sauces in Hayes Valley. Prices are moderate and you'll certainly feel like you're in the middle of Florence.< /Review>

It was alright Italian.  I wouldn't say it was the best Italian I have ever had but it was good.  I had the Uccelli Scappati and it was somewhat grisly.  My wife had the gnocchi which was really good.  We just weren't super impressed.</Review>

We went here for dinner before a show in the Civic Center area. We were incredibly disappointed with the customer service and unsanitary restaurant conditions. There were ants everywhere! All over the walls and tables. Not only this but the staff were exceedingly rude. I would certainly not recommend this when there are many, many other wonderful restaurants in Hayes Valley. Ick. Just gross.< /text>

Intimate, red-checkered-table-cloth and candlelit setting, ooey gooey homemade pasta dishes. This is the kind of place that makes you feel right at home. Try the lasagnetta, a rolled/pinwheel lasagna creation. It'll change your life.< /text>

Intimate setting, delicious food, and friendly service.

Enjoyed the homemade pastas (fettuccine and fusilli) and well-balanced sauces. Service was friendly and accommodating.

Make sure to grab an espresso and tiramisu before you head out.</review>

The food here was authentic but uninspiring. The dishes were true to a traditional Italian meal, but there was something off about the place. The Italian woman that works there didn't seem to care if you spoke Italian to her. Overall you're better off paying that much money elsewhere.<//Review>

<text>Group of 4 people. Cutlery was dirty, 3 of our forks still had food on them.

Glasses were dirty, grimy on the sides and one of them had food on the side.

We all ordered pasta, all of our meals were below standard. For an italian place this pasta was so average that all of us were confident we could make it better.

Lastly to top it off, 2 of the people in our group had food poisoning.

I dont know if it was an off night or this is a regular occurance and i dont want to find out.< /text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<Text>Two words: carbsivore heaven!

If they run out of their infamous scrumptious kouign amann, do not proceed to the cashier, just leave and come back another time. Not sure if they got better since last time I was here or more travels made me appreciate this place more. I won't spend time on describing how perfect their kouign amann is. ¡Just have it!  I couldn't spell those two words so I copied pasted from Dr. Google.  Kouign amann is a sweetish pastry that is a cousin to croissant; originated from Brittany, France.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

Super cheesy romantic Italian place, but food was awesome. You feel like you're in a really narrow Italian alleyway in the evening summer heat with the murals and decorations (and the lack of AC). Tables are covered in checkered cloth and wine glasses everywhere, but the food really makes this place great. Fresh pasta can be expected for sure, but don't skip out on the antipasto, which was a really large plate with a good variety of prochutto, olives, roasted garlic, artichoke hearts, and caprese (basil, fresh mozzarella, and heirloom tomatoes) . For mains, I did the meat lasganette and he had the penne alla puttenesca. Both were delicious and really flavorful. My lasagnette was made fresh and layered perfectly. The chef rolled out the pasta behind the counter and you could see him stretch it out. The sauces were delicious too. Bread was complementary and was great with the olive oil and balsamic vinegar. This might not be the cleanest place (glasses weren't completely shiny), but the food makes up for it.< /text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Bad attention. We asked for a mix of rifles and pennes and they only brought us pennes, cold, the bread that we requested did not arrive. They brought us an account with a value much greater than our order and when we complained he told us that ours was on the other side (they were handwritten numbers).
We will not return

(Original)
Mala atención. Pedimos un mix de fusiles y pennes y solo nos trajeron pennes, frios, nunca llegó el pan q les solicitamos. Nos trajeron una cuenta con un valor mucho mayor q nuestra orden y cuando reclamamos nos dijo q lo nuestro estaba del otro lado ( eran números escritos a mano).

<review>Great  service! Amazing assistants and Dr. I thought bringing in all 3 of my children would be mission impossible but with their professional well trained assistants, my two toddlers 5 & 3 loved it and didn’t want to leave. The whole office is catered to young children and not once did they fear the word DENTIST. I recommend this team to any parent with young children. Special thanks to Dr. Raj< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

My daughter had an awesome experience and I love that they give her a little toy after her visit.  The staff is super friendly and do such a good job with COVID measures.  My daughter had such a good experience that she came telling her dad how much fun she had at the dentist.  Would definitely recommend this office to friends and family!<//review>

< Review>
I brought my 9 month old here after she chipped her little front tooth. Everyone was amazingly kind and gentle. I could tell us being comfortable was their priority. The dentist, Ms. Nancy, was so calm and sweet when checking out my squirmy babies tiny teeth (she even sang her a little song while she looked at them). I am so glad I found this place and look forward to my daughter having only the most positive experiences here for years to come!</Review>

<review>I loved our first visit with my daughter here yesterday! They do a great job maintaining everyone’s safety and the office is really clean! My daughter cried a little but it’s ok! Totally normal for her first visit ;D Dr. Raj and the staff were all so nice and friendly! After the procedure they gave us the baggie with tooth brush, tooth paste, floss stickers and a toy! On top of that we also got to take a picture and he also gave us a bib! Totally feel better knowing that they provide such high quality care for kids!</review>< pictures>

The clinicians double masked (N95 & procedural) which I appreciated considering social distancing is impossible for a dental visit.  I certainly can empathize on how dedicated they were in covering their faces as they saw patients.  Anthony, the dental hygienist, and Dr Raj were not only informative but very friendly and engaging to my kids.  Thank you for a great experience!< /text>< pictures>

<review>I took my two year old child to the dentist for the first time, and we were both very nervous. The hygienist and doctor were both so great and helped us both feel calm and relaxed. They used a cushioned board laid across mine and the doctor's knees and had my kiddo lay back, so it was almost like they were still sitting in my lap. I expected the doctor to have a hard time looking in my toddler's mouth, as they don't like anyone looking or poking in there, but she was able to get their mouth open easily. She counted and looked at my kiddos teeth, flossed, brushed, and was done in about five minutes. My toddler got several stickers, a toothbrush, toothpaste, a couple of flossers, and a "first dentist visit" magnet with our picture, to help them remember and hopefully be less scared next time.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I really loved the friendly staff and the caring way that they interacted with my two year old son. We didn’t feel rushed and he left saying, “ Where did they go? Go see dentist.” One suggestion, my son is very verbal, and when the hygienist was prepping for the dentist she was being very kind and trying to warn me that some kids may cry. While I understand why she said that, for us at least, avoiding the word cry would be better. Oh, and I just LOVED the first visit magnet that they gave with a photo of us and the dentist! He put it low on the fridge and keeps going up to it and saying, “Went to the dentist! Counted teeth!”. Thank you!</Review>

<Text>We have been going to this office with our 3.5yr old for about a year now. All the staff are super nice and the office is clean. There are iPads, books, toys, TV in the waiting room, even an outdoor area! Of course during C19 all of this is off limits. The treatment rooms are decorated for young kids, with TVs on the ceiling with many movie options. Our son loves going to the dentist and I'm grateful we've found Silicon Valley Pediatric Dentistry.<//Text>< Resp>

My 8yr old daughter has a fear of the dentist and was very nervous about going to SVPD for the first time. Once the dental assistant started telling her step by step what was going to happen, my daughter began to relax. She was very sweet and explained to my daughter everything that was going in her mouth. We had a wonderful experience overall and my daughter can’t wait to go again.<//Text>

Extremely kid-friendly and very modern setup! My daughter was immediately welcomed by a friendly staff member who gave her a sticker and a warm greeting.  All paperwork was done electronically and easily processed for a new patient. Hygienist was very informative of the process for my young (2-year old daughter) and was flexible in postponing her cleaning when she got scared of the big chair and refused to lay down. Dr. Nancy was very kind and again gave a sticker to easy the anxiety. Though my daughter cried through the examination, they tried to made it as easy as possible as I sat with her on my lap through the check-up. It was a quick appointment, but I think my daughter will warm up to it, as it was a bonus that they have a tv mounted to the ceiling playing a selection of movies.</review>

< Review>
Our family has been searching for a long time for a great Pediatric Dentist. We don’t need to look any further! Silicon Valley Pediatric Dentistry is Amazing!
They went beyond my expectations. Our families extremely happy. My girls 4 and 7 loved it. The bright happy atmosphere, kid prizes on the wall, entertainment and play area. So much attention to detail that appeals to children. The staff was so caring and attentive, I must say we were impressed.
Last but not least, the dentist did an exceptional job cleaning our daughters teeth. She was able to deep clean bad tarter buildup missed by the last dentist only 6 months ago. I can’t say enough about the positive experience we all experienced today. My only regret is that I didn’t find them sooner when my kids were babies. I highly recommend Silicon Valley Pediatric Dentistry, you won’t be disappointed.</Review>

<review>My daughter LOVES going to the dentist! Even in this COVID world she is still comfortable and so am I. Everyone there is so nice! We see Dr. Nancy who is AMAZING and explains things to my daughter in words she can understand, counts her teeth with letters and has her make funny noises when she opens and closes her mouth to bite down. She had her first  X-Rays today and rocked it! Thank you SVPD!<//review>< user>

<review>This place is absolutely worth all the 5-star reviews.

Beautiful/clean facility (my daughter didn't want to leave the outdoor play area), they have TVs on the CEILING that kept my daughter happy as a clam for the entire appointment. The dental hygienist knew all the tricks to getting my 3yo to be super comfortable throughout the entire process, and Dr Nancy was great.

When she was 2, my daughter went to another place and was terrified. We took her here and she loved the entire visit. This is exactly what you'd hope a pediatric dentist office would be. Thank you Dr Nancy and team!</review><username>Leila Delee<//username><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x808fcaf87cf44ce7:0x6fede96ae2be29d1< /Gmap_id><UserId.>113908846404441021374</UserId.><Date>1578143164860</Date>< Rating>

<review>I love the whole staff here. I've never had a negative experience here for my two young kids. I've tried other Pediatric dentists before and Silicon Valley Pediatric Dentistry stands out far above the others with their knowledgeable and heartwarming staff and innovative technology.< /review>< user_name>

<review>We had a great experience here for my son’s first dentist visit! Everyone was so nice and the dental assistant and dentist were very patient and gentle with my son.

<text>It’s such a relief to have my kids yell, “Yay!” when I tell them it’s time for a dental appointment. We’ve been seeing Dr. Scotty for five years now and we’ve never had a bad visit. The office staff, dental assistants and dentists are amazing. I am so happy we found Silicon Valley Pediatric Dentistry!<//text>< Rating>

I visited here for adult orthodontics consultation. Dr. Janice Hwang is so nice and patient. She examined my teeth very carefully and explained my situation with many details. She is professional and skilled, providing me the treatment plan which fits my teeth condition. I like the friendly environment, they don't push me and sell their services.
Plus, they do a great job in protection from Covid 19. Taking temperature outdoors, separating patients, wearing N95 musks and gloves.
If you plan to get braces or Invisalign, I do recommend you to visit Dr. Janice.<//Review>

Loved our first experience here and my 2 year old's first ever Dental appointment. She was nervous going in but the staff worked to make her feel comfortable. She didn't want to leave after her appointment because the outside area was too much fun to let go.

The staff and dentist were very helpful and informative. I have already recommended this place to friends with small children.</Review>

10 out of 10 would recommend. I took my 3 year old and almost 2 year old son for their very first visit and we all emerged with smiles. Staff was patient and engaging with my boys and this put me at ease. So glad their first experience with the dentist was a positive one! Dr. Scotty was awesome!<//Text>

<GmapID>0x808fcaf87cf44ce7:0x6fede96ae2be29d1<//GmapID><text>We had a great experience here.  The two dentists we worked with were friendly and professional, and did a great job interacting with my 3 year old daughter.  The staff was also very friendly and helpful.  The office has a lot of toys and even a little playground, which my daughter loved, and she got a token for a little toy after, all of which helped to take the anxiety out of the experience for her (and for me!).

8/20/20 Update - We had a follow up, and we were impressed by the COVID precautions that are now in place.  They have a great setup and we felt very safe being there.  Even with the precautions, my now 4 year old daughter was still very comfortable, still got a little toy (which she loved, of course!), and she liked interacting with the dentist, hygienist and staff.  They did a great job, and we're very happy with their level of service, friendliness and professionalism.< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>Hi everyone I am Bishnu. I bring my 8 year old son with special needs for his dental checkups to Silicon Valley Pediatric Dentistry. They are good with making him get his clean up done .  They always follow up in time and are real good at sending appointment reminders so you would never miss one. I would recommend it to all the parents looking for a good dentistry for there kids.

Outstanding and everything I was looking for in a pediatric dentist!! My 20 month old loved the outside patio, blocks, and iPads! It was a nice surprise welcome to see my sons name on the glass door. The dental assistant, Anthony did a thorough job explaining oral hygiene for pediatrics, things to avoid, how to brush, and taught me something new for my sons oral care after breastfeeding at nights.

Dr. Raj was everything I was looking for in a healthcare professional. Someone who greeted my child, used knee to knee tactics, was gentle yet efficient at brushing my son’s teeth. I don’t know how he did it!  You can tell he genuinely enjoys what he does with children.

Thank you so much for the fridge magnet picture!!<//Text>

My youngest child was traumatized by a non-pediatric dentist and Silicon Valley Pediatric helped my child love going to the dentist again. Both my children and myself are very happy to go there for their dental care and cannot be more pleased with the quality and love they pour into their profession. They are very upfront with costs; no hidden fees, no unexpected bills, no fake news. Thank you for all you do.</review><Resp>None< /Resp></record></dataset><record>

This is our family pediatric dentist and it's amazing. The new location is beautiful! My girls love going to the dentist and there is plenty to do while one is waiting for the other to finish.

<Review>Customer service is great for the most part and the staff are kind all times. They’re very kid friendly which is perfect for littles who may fear the dentist. My middle child had some fears and issues with X-rays. The staff person was super patient with her. They are very inflexible with scheduling little ones past 12pm. I have 3 kids. 2 who are in school, one not and isn’t eligible for appointments after noon until she’s 6. It makes it HARD when making sure I’m not pulling kids out of class for appointments in the morning and not having to take extra hours off from work to accommodate different scheduling times. I don’t feel it beneficial that 1 child has to come in the mornings, and in order to have all 3 kids come at the same time so I don’t skip too much work I have to pull 2 out of school.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Friendly, clean, and totally catering to the needs of children. Lots of fun toys to keep their minds entertained and reduce anxiety. I took my two year old here and he had a great experience.< /review>

<text>My two daughters(6 and 3) both had their appointments today with Dr. Scotty. If you have children and they need a dentist, I highly recommend Dr. Scottys practice at Silicon Valley Pediatric Dentistry. The office staff is always so helpful and friendly, and I have to give credit to  the hygienist Nayeli who did a great job of explaining to my 3 year old the teeth cleaning process. I watched m 3 year old being on the verge of tears to hopping off the chair with a giant smile on her face, I couldn't have been more relieved to have it go so well.  We first came into Dr. Scotty when I needed a second opinion for my eldest daughter and I couldn't imagine them going anywhere else for dental care since. he takes his time with his patients to answer any and all questions or concerns the parents might have. His cheerful disposition always puts my kids at ease.  Thank you to everyone at Silicon Valley Pediatric, as always we walked away very happy.</text>< Pictures>

My two year old had her first dental check up with Dr. Nancy. From the paperless check in process to the easy and non threatening dental exam, our first check up was wonderful!
I’m excited to have found a practice that will help my daughter become comfortable with taking care of her smile.<//Review>

Staff, dental assistants and dentists are always very friendly, welcoming and more than accomadating.

We see Dr. Nancy, Dr. Scotty and Dr. Raj. I have 4 kids so seeing the same dentist isn't always easy. They are always so friendly and welcoming. My kids love them and look forward to coming here.< /text>

I loved how clean and nice the office was.  There is a fun play area for kids outside that kept my son busy.  There were many fun things for my son to look at.  Dr. Scotty and the staff were great, friendly, and really cared about what they are doing.<//review>

Dr. Scott and the entire staff are very friendly and professional.  The office is set up to make the child patient comfortable.  I like that Dr. Scott makes a point of talking to the children first, then addressing the parents in the room.  Highly recommend.</Review>

<Text>I shopped around dentists a lot as my daughter is very scared of dentists. I am very happy with this practice for a few reasons: (1) offered several options for caries management for my child. Other practices simply said they need to put her under and get the cavities filled ASAP. I was nervous about putting such a young child under general anesthesia. SVPD offered us a much more gentle course of treatment. They used temporary fillings  and with close monitoring my daughter is doing well for past 1 year. She also looks forward to her dentist visits! (2) their facilities are decorated in a very child friendly way. My daughter loves the outdoor play area and spends 10-15 minutes prior to the appointment playing which helps her relax (3) affordable. I was worried that given the quality of care they would require a lot out of pocket but that wasn't the case at all.

Very happy with their service and couldn't recommend highly enough. Thanks SVPD!<//Text>< Rate>

<Text>We have been patients with Dr. Scotty for almost 5 years now and we couldn’t be happier. We recently had a bit of a concern with a tooth coming in, I took a picture and sent it to them and within minutes I had an email asking if we were able to come in that day to get it checked out. We were able to come in and our concerns and were handled with such care. At the very least I suggest a consultation with Dr. Scotty, everyone there really does look after your kids very well.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

I have said on any platform I possibly can - Dr. Scotty and his staff are absolutely SUPERB! My child is NOT a fan of going to the dentist (I can’t quite figure out why, they are SO awesome!) but the staff always remain calm even when my child is being QUITE dramatic. They always have a smile on their face and are so gentle and understanding. I would refer EVERYONE to bring their child here. They are THE best.< /Text>

Truly an awesome and amazing pediatric dental office. A clean, bright office with plenty of toys, there is even an outside gated area with outside toys/little playhouse. All the staff was so nice, know how to make kids feel extra comfortable, explain things really well. I could not have asked for a better experience. This was my first time taking my 3 year old and it went so smoothly. (I even took pictures of my daughter’s teeth prior to the appointment, expecting the worst.) We saw Dr Scott Ngai and he was truly so good with my toddler and also explaining everything to me at the same time. We read books about the dentist before going but to tell you the truth, their office goes above and beyond of making both the kid and parent feel comfortable. And to top it off, aside from the TV on ceiling(the assistant said she can turn it on to whatever we request) and numerous stickers, at the very end they give your kid a token to pick a prize at the end. Genius! So thankful for this office! Thank you!</review>

It was especially important for us that we find a dentist for our kids where they felt comfortable. Dr. Nancy is amazing with the kids! Anthony as well, he is super nice and personable!

<text>My 2 year old had his first dental appointment ever yesterday. It was not traumatizing - and he is going to go back in 6 months. I realize this is a low bar but being comfortable at the dentist is super important for me.

Office has toys, iPads, TV.
The appointment room has a TV.
They do a knee to knee appointment first.
The dentist was friendly and energetic.
My kiddo got a sticker + another for not getting a cavity.
We got a photo/magnet for our first ever visit (which is probably the most amazing part for me).
He got a cute little giraffe after the appointment.

He walked out happy and with all 16 of his teeth flouride-d up.

We’ll be back. So happy we found this practice.<//text><Rate>5</Rate><date>1574226744998< /date>< Response>

My daughter's first visit for possible Cavaties. This place was referred to us by friends and we were so thankful they did. Staff is amazing and they care very much about the children. Sooo glad we found them. If your child has Cavaties no worries....they have a laser that makes no noise and no need for drills or shots. You wont be disappointed!<//Review>

Thank you Dr. Scott and Dr. Philip Yen for walking me thru all your process and putting me at ease. I was extremely scared to let my daughter undergo general anesthesia in order to get her tooth clean, extracted, and protected. You earn this mom trust. Thank you for all your help. We will be back for continuous preventive care.< /text>

Both Dr. Scotty and Dr. Sonya are amazing.  My son is incredibly sensitive and we were at the end of the line trying to find someone to take care of his needed dental work.  They made him feel very welcome and reassured and he is now always fine with going back for cleaning or other needed work.  The equipment is state of the art and the staff wonderfully friendly and helpful.</Text>

Such a great dentist office! Took our 2 yr old there and had a great experience. When she was initially resistant, they took their time and made sure it was still a positive experience. 6 months later at her second appointment, it was a snap to do the full cleaning. Highly recommended!!<//text>

We brought our 5 year old here but found this office is not good for young children. They don't listen to your need and treated you rudely. All they care is to sell you the treatment plans.  They tried to put our little one for whole body anesthesia and they first send the assistant to pressure my wife then Dr. Raj pressured her.  Worst place ever.< /Review>

<Review>After being disappointed is my daughters' previous dentist, I discovered this place through a Mommy & Me event in Santana Row and saw the stellar reviews and decided to give it a try.

My 5 year old and my almost 2 year old had a great experience today, as soon as you walk in the door the waiting room is very kid friendly and neither girl had time to be nervous because they were so excited to play with the toys! The receptionist was very friendly and very kid savvy. She smiled a lot and addressed both girls directly. My daughters were both very comfortable. It was a very short wait and then we went right into the exam room.

Also, the receptionist was very up front about what insurance would cover, percentages etc... Which I greatly appreciated because other dentists I have been to avoid mentioning any of that until you're quoted a crazy amount for treatment.

My husband and I decided ahead of time that we didn't want to do any unnecessary xrays and when I declined them there was no pressure and no repeated pushing, which was always experienced in the past.

The cleanings for both girls went really well, they watched Moana on the screen on the ceiling and were very comfortable. The hygienist was amazing! Both girls really liked her a lot. She was very patient and explained everything in detail as she did things. It really was a great experience.

When the dentist came to check their teeth after the cleaning both girls were comfortable. My 2 year old took a little coaxing to get back in the chair but the dentist was very patient and we were able to keep everything positive. They took a picture afterwards and both girls were happy! They also got stickers, a goody bag and a toy when they left. A little extra was a magnetic picture of them with the dentist which my girls loved. Also... No Cavities!!!

I would and will recommend this place to anyone looking for a very kid friendly dentist! I wish my dentist was this great! Thank you so much!!!<//Review>< Pics>

We have been coming here for over 2 years since our first daughter became a ghter became a toddler.  The staff is fun and super friendly and Mariela will welcome you at the desk and make you feel like family.  It's amazing how our kids love to come to the dentist.  The kids comes and enjoy toys and video games in the waiting room and cartoons while they get their teeth cleaned! And Dr.Scotty is practically part of the family.  We highly recommend this dentistry for your children.</Review>< pictures>

I have been bringing my oldest son(4) here for about a year now and every time I come in a feel awesome! They are so friendly and make you feel really special since your walk into their office. I now bring my 2 year old and he had no problems! Dr. Scotty makes the kids feel at ease and you as a parent as well. When picking a dentist for my 4 year old I was really scared that it was going to be hard for him because of the bad rep alot of dentist get, but Dr.Scotty made the process real nice and easy! I would definitely recommend for your little one< /review>

Above and beyond kid dentist service. Kindness and they involve the kids in each step. I don't feel pressured into procedures and they take their time to explain to the kids and adults pros and cons. ❤️ Dr Scotty and Mairi and all the staff front and back. They are kind, considerate, use auto texting software  to remind us what's next for appts and our absolutely favorite. Office is set up for kids from Lego and video games to tv to distract them and sunglasses for sensitive eyes. Even the X-rays are easier! Dr Scotty even tries alternative ways of procedures if your kid is nervous like mine was of suction. I couldn't be happier. They make going to the Dentist a lot easier for the kids and for the parents !! I only wish they also served adults too, as I'd likely go dentist more if mine was a great and caring as this place. Thumbs up. Keep up great work guys.<//text>

Victor was great and professional. Honestly, you can go to pepboys and bigotires and they use the same machine. But they will charge you double.

I bought tires only and had him install them for $20/each. Was done in 30mins including balancing.

I'll definitely come here for any future tire or brake works</Review>

Amazing service and prices. They treated me with respect and were very informative about my repairs. As a woman I get very concern about mechanics because of prior experiences so when a friend recommend this place I gave it a try. I had been there for used tires before but this time I went for major repairs. I am very satisfied with the customer service and prices so I recommend  them.< /Text>

I called about 20 mins before the shop closed. I told the man I was desperate because I had a leak in a tire and a long drive that night. Told him I wasn't sure if I could get there before they closed but would hurry. When I knew I wouldn't make it, that I'd not arrive until about 10 minutes after closing, he drove back to meet me to unlock the gate and be my hero. After changing my tire he noticed one of my hub caps (which I had put on myself) wasn't aligned properly and fixed it for me. Also put air in my tires. Very nice guy. This was about 6 months ago. I told him I'd write a good review but put it off, forgot, etc. The tire he gave me has given me no problems.< /review></record>

I went to this place about 4 months ago cause my car's 2 rear tires kept losing air. Victor told me that my rims were cracked and willing to fix them for $80 each. He said he would have to send them out to be welded.
4 months later, I'm having the same issue, but this time I took my car to Bob's Tire Town at Arlington & Washington. The guy working on my car said that the rims were not welded, but just sealed with a sealant. So I have to pay again for the rims to be welded.

I also ordered couple of tires from Tire & Wheels last month. Victor told me that he can get the tires cheaper than anywhere else including Ebay & Amazon. Couple of days later, I drop by there & I found out that he had ordered the wrong size & blaming me for his mistake. Told me to come back in a couple of days. I returned there only to find out that he had ordered the wrong style of tires. I had asked for summer tires, instead he had ordered all weather tires. He also looked drunk & asked for cash. When I asked him, why cash? He said that's non of your business. Obviously, I did not accept these tires & went to Bob's Tire Discount where they found couple of Continental summer tires that usually cost over $300 each for $165 each.

Victor is not an honest guy & runs a very shady business. He does not deserve anyone's business.<//text>

<text>My girlfriend was towed here when she had a nail in her tire and broke down nearby. This shop sold her used tires (which itself is an atrocious act) for MORE than a new set would have cost. Avoid at all cost - when these guys saw an ounce of vulnerability went for the kill.< /text><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80c2b981aad9a71d:0x217977a8df82c1d8</gmapID>< userid>

This place is over priced for what I got done. The barber cut my hair pretty good and my beard was trimmed unevenly and super short. A normal haircut and beard trim would cost 35 to 40 but they charged double the price.<//review>

I am impressed! The outside of this place looks like a little hole in the wall, but the inside looks fantastic! Hardwood floors, TV's all over, and even a little car for the kids to sit in while waiting or getting their hair cut. To top it off the even include a little beer with each hair cut. That's a nice treat.

The barber I got was the manager and she did a great job. I have used several and for some reason or another many of them don't get the fade right. I feel like she did a fantastic job. I'll be back again.< /Review>

<Text>Guillermo absolutely took care of me here. He definitely knows his stuff and is quick about his work as well as we might all know, some barbers take a whole eternity to get you done. We had a very cool conversation while I got the cut and they'll also offer you some drinks while you're getting the cut. The place is very clean and it has a very nice ambience to it. The best part is that they're also open late which saved me the first time I stopped by. At the end of the cut they'll also clean you up with a hot towel and they even give you a little massage as the cherry on top. Definately a place to come if you like good service and cuts.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

< Review>
Never heard of this place but i just googled barbershops near where i live and seen this place was open late. I truly appreciate that because not everyone can make it to shops by 5 or 6 which is when most of them close. I called ahead of time just to make sure they had availability and I’m not sure if it was Dana or Jana who answered but she was very sweet and professional. We arrived an hour later and Dana took my 14month and husband immediately! She was so completely sweet and patient with my crying 14month old but my favorite thing was how fast she completed his haircut! I’ve gone to places where it’s taken them 45 to an hour to cut my baby’s hair and she did it so quickly and perfectly! Jana was there to try to comfort and console him during the crying. She stopped what she was cleaning to try to offer him a lollipop or game to play. That is beyond sweet. Both of these girls were amazing. Dana also cut my husbands hair amazingly well. This is now our new favorite shop! We will be driving from Fontana just because of they’re AMAZING customer service skills and how fun the shop is.<//Review>

<date>1583899689071</date><Text>This barber shop was recommended by the Hotel Staff at The Residence Inn by Marriot,and I was BLOWN AWAAAAY!
Jessica(Who is also the Manager) took care of Me. Let Me tell You.. this was an EXPERIENCE!!!💯
Great conversation. Great service. We talked about Boxing, Life,The World Situation these days, and She was very candid and respectful. I endorse this Place IMMENSELY!! It's a SPORTS FANS ULTIMATE Man Cave!!I came in Scruffy and Busted Out CLEAN and BRAND NEW with a sense of Good Vibes.Do Yourself the Service.. TREAT YOURSELF to something GREAT. Do it at DRAFT CUTS!! It's not just an "Edging" .. it's an EXPERIENCE!
THANKS!! I'll make sure I travel 3000 miles to do it All over again. I'm from MIAMI, FLORIDA btw.
Thanks for Your Time.

We arrived to get early seating for the band and the place was somewhat empty and quiet at about 5:30PM.  However by the time the band starting playing the place was absolutely packed – I think even the owner was not expecting such a large crowd.   We haven’t been to this spot since it was Graffiti, so this was our first impression of this new Restaurant located in the attractive Waterfront district in Petaluma, CA.  So we started looking over the menu which was all new to us.  The waiter was very pleasant and eager to please and did a fantastic job serving us.  Things got super crazy with the crowd later in the evening and even when our waiter wasn’t available two other waiters popped by and took our drink orders for us.
The menu was great.  We started with an appetizer (called small plates on their menu) that was a special and not on the menu – it was a hybrid between a Cheese Wonton and a Taquito and was a great starter with the spicy siracha aioli sauce and a fresh guacamole dip that also had a kick.  We wanted to try the Chicken Wings so we asked our waiter what his favorite was he recommended the Sticky Lemon-Pepper wings.  The appetizers were fresh and had great flavor and very satisfying for a starter.  We also started with a glass of wine and was pleased to learn their house Chardonnay was Hess.  It was served with a starting pour and a mini carafe – it was a very generous pour if you took the carafe and poured into your glass topped of the glass very generously unlike their predecessor Graffiti who weighed and laser scanned their pours and charged you top dollar for them. Also we were pleasantly surprised that since we were there before 6 it was still their happy hour when we ordered them and it was $2 off their usual cost for a glass.  For our main menu we ordered the burger with sweet potato fries and the fennel sausage, pepper and onion pizza.  You will have to excuse the hamburger was ordered 'done' thus the appearance might suggest it was well but it was cooked and prepared exactly as ordered.  I would have ordered it medium but my guest had to have their meat well done.  The burger had tons of flavor and there was no mistaking - this was a very lean beef that had tons of flavor.  The garnishing was very fresh and flavorable and the bun was soft and fresh.  A little aioli on the side made a great pairing.   The pizza was the waiter’s third favorite choice on the menu, his first was the Flatbread Chicken Sandwich – which we want to try when we return.  The pizza was excellent – the peppers were yellow and red peppers and not the more bitter green peppers.  The sausage was loaded with flavor and every bite was pleasing to the palate.   It was large so I could only eat half of it after chowing down the starters.  With belly full and completely satisfied, I wanted to try out the cocktails at the bar and ordered a Bombay Sapphire tonic with a lime.   Again, like the wine we find that it was a good pour and came in a bucket– it was not to strong and not to weak – it was poured just right.  Overall with the great food and drinks and a fantastic band made for the perfect evening out.
The Sideman music is inspired by 1970s Jazz/Funk/Fusion and influenced by artists like Tom Scott, the Crusaders, David Sanborn, and Larry Carlton.   We were especially happy and surprised when they played an Average White Band and Grover Washington, Jr. tune.  Welker put together group of top notch veteran and professional musicians that played with, and have experience in playing with, internationally known bands. So the entertainment that Red Brick pulled together was great.<//review><Rating>5</Rating>< gmapID>

I used to come to this restaurant before it changed ownership - and enjoyed it on those limited occasions that I could.  What I especially like about the current management is the option the feel more 'casual' when I come. I also appreciate a respectable menu of appetizers since I'm not often inclined to eat a full meal.
As before, the location is aces! It's one of the few scenic locations right on the river that has a photogenic view.
If anyone is open to recommendations, I would strongly suggest the fish tacos - WOW, I love them!</text>

<review>This is a very nice restaurant with a great menu and good service. It is also a music venue although it seems to attract the geriatric crowd. Not that there's anything wrong with that !! it just isn't the most exciting place when there is music.< /review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

The service was fantastic , we had quite a delightful time.  Red brick will most certainly become a regular place for us.  The waterfront setting is just spectacular.< /review>< Pictures>

I joined some friends here. The first thing I noticed was how long it took to actually see a server. I ordered my drink and again I had to wait at least 15 mins. I ordered an old fashioned  and was served whiskey with melted ice. I didn't order food because the waitstaff and terrible drink were enough to make me reconsider. Will not be going again.< /review>

We entered this place looking for lunch, as all the best rated restaurants were crowded with a long waiting time. It was kind of empty and it looked like the fee tables remaining were already at the check stage. However, it took forever to get service, we sat outside maybe that's why. There were only 2 waiters at that hour but as I said it was not busy or rush hour. So, 45min passed and they finally took our order. Food came quicker than expected, it was good but not great, I guess the whole waiting time knock out the happiness in us. Anyway, it was not bad in terms of food.<//Review>

<review>We went in for a quick bite at the bar.  I'm excited about the openess of the interior! I had the chicken tenders, which needed seasoning & salt very badly, but very tender...lovely salad! We'll be back from sure...the menu looks good!<//review></record></dataset><record>

I am normally pretty understanding when it comes to having to wait to get served but this place was ridiculous. It was not busy at all and our server Lacey disappeared for large quantities of time, nowhere to be seen in the restaurant; we had to request assistance from the hostess just to get our beverage order.  The food was okay, not nearly good enough to make up for the lousy service.  Additionally our bill was $105 (w/o tip) (2 glasses of wine each, crab cakes, he had steak, I had Cobb salad) and it took us two hours to finish the meal because of the bad service. I see no reason to go back, there are plenty of great places to eat in Petaluma.< /Text>

Really routing for this place but lacking ambiance. Menu has potential but how can you be out of hamburgers. And $15 a glass of wine... really. Come on hire a professional reastauranteur and make this place great!</Review>

Love music and casual atmosphere,  bottle of tap water with glasses on each table.
Prices are a little high for food you can find at other locations less expensive. Good place to try atleast once by water front edge experience.<//Review>

<rate>2<//rate><text>Being married to a server I am pretty sympathetic to what servers have to deal with but we are super easy customers.  First off, it took forever before we even saw our server and then he seemed quite put off that we weren't ordering drinks.  Then it took forever for him to return to get our dinner order.  The fish and chips were quite bready and only 3 small pieces.  The cole slaw was good.  Seafood pasta was mediocre as some of the mussels and clams weren't open.  You just can't serve those like that.  If the service had been top notch they would have gotten another star but all in all this is a 3 star restaurant at best.</text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Good atmosphere for adults anf kids. Good menu selection (from pizza, fish & chips to ceviche and seafood pasta).
Had the fish tacos, ceviche and avocado & tuna poke, all were very good.
Right on the Peraluma river, great views.
Band was playing, but we got a corner table and wasn't too loud to talk with friends.
Service was great and our waiter was very helpful & friendly.
I think we got a great new place to go in town!!< /Text>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>I asked for the avocado toast, it came with egg on top of the toast and I requested for no egg. The chef scraped the egg out of the toast and gave me the same one. The bread was not toasted well, the avocado n pesto was not spread well, it was lumpy and uneven. There was no salt, no cilantro, no pickles. It was just plain. I paid $9 for this!!!! I had high expectations for boudin, no more.</text>< pics>

What a god forsaken, sorry of an excuse for a food establishment. I ordered 7 sandwhiches and we received 6 sandwhiches and ONE BOX WITH TWO SLICES OF BACON. This was my first and the LAST time I am EVER getting food from here. AND OF COURSE I'M THE ONE WHO DIDNT GET THEIR FOOD!! I could have easily gotten a much better experience at the most run down Mc Donald's in town. With service this bad it shouldn't be anywhere near Santana row and instead moved over to the east side of San Jose where the service is expected to be this awful. In the end I paid 12 bucks for a sandwhich I never received. My friend ordered the grate with crispy bacon and received a box with two slices of HARDLY crispy bacon and the wrong sandwhich altogether. SHAMEFUL< /text>

Small shop in a mall setting, but it offers full service like other Boudin locations. I ordered the last round, three of the long loaves, two fish shape small buns, the last turtle shape, some shamrock cookies, and half a dozen mini buns. They travel to Michigan in prefect shape, but be sure to tell the attendant you want the bread to travel, so that they place it in plastic bags. Everything was delicious, and the service was cordial.<//Text>

I am a fan of the brand but this place just did not have it.  Service was extremely slow.  Food was very so so here and breads were not fresh or good.  I would like to say that the staff was polite and used and changed gloves every time needed while I was there waiting.</review>

Authentic no-frills and affordable dim sum dining experience. The service is straightforward and the staff was nice when we engaged with them. The food was delicious, our highlight was the pork and chives dumplings. For sweets it was the mochi with black sesame filling, it was splendid! Will come back again!< /review>

They will not honor the orders as placed and expect customers to pay for their mistakes. Owner is rude. Stay away - they don’t deserve to be in business as they simply don’t understand customer service.<//Review>

Everything is just pretty ok overall. The Peking duck and the Walnut shrimp were pretty solid but the lobster and the beef dishes were bland.<//text>

Good local dim sum eatery. Crowded.  Asian locals love it .I go with my Chinese friends who order yummy things for me. Always prepared authentically. Reasonably priced. The more at table..at least 3 the more choices and fun.<//text>

There are so many specials!! The lobster is a great deal here! I like to get it cooked with green onions and ginger! I don't know if the lobster is fresh though...they also make their roast pork and BBQ pork fresh everyday!</review>

Edit- 11/20/19 Rice roll noodles have gone down the drain, thick and mushy. Scallop steam dumplings all punctured and broken. Every type of dim sum we ordered had at least 2 broken dim sum in each order. The quality has gone way down. We just paid $50 for some unraveled steamed dumplings.

The food is a lot better! Excellent rice noodles. Chicken feet could be a little bit softer. Siu Mai are a little disappointing, but the other dumplings are good.

<user>106814983114996276857</user><Review>I've been coming to this Dim Sum place for awhile now! I come here if I want to sit down and enjoy dim sum at a restaurant. It's a great place for an early lunch IMO.

Food - I would kill for their fried shrimp balls. It's delicious. I have also tried their steamed shrimp dumpling, pork buns, shrimp rice noodle, shu mais, seasame balls, shrimp and chive dumplings, and much more. I recently tried their fish fried rice and their fried calamari which was also delicious - something I have ordered that wasn't the dumplings! I have some preferences for some dim sum but I mostly order the ones with the shrimp in it (if you can't tell already)! Their portions are very generous so this place gets you full easily! They have jasmine tea and oolong tea as options!

Service - The waitresses can be a little hard to communicate with because the restaurant can get busy! They give you a piece of paper and you mark how many of what you want, and they will bring it to you after. Some waitresses will try and serve you plates that you didn't order by walking around with trays of food or carts. DON'T GET HUSSLED! If you don't want it, don't order it! It's okay to say no. Some of the waitresses will also try to sell you on chicken or duck - again, DONT GET HUSSLED! Overall, from all my experiences they are friendly and will be prompt when asking for forks, refills for water or tea, and bringing extra napkins of that sort.

Environment - This place gets PACKED and LOUD! It's insane how busy this place gets. But that means this place gets good business. If you aren't used to eating at Chinese restaurants where everyone is talking or shouting across tables, or where you can hear a butcher chopping up meat for you or waitresses yelling orders across the restaurant. Then this place may not be for you.

Overall, I don't understand how this place has low reviews as it has not disappointed me yet. I hope it stays this way! I'll be back!<//Review><date>1559578431035</date>< name>

It's a steal, nowhere can you eat for 8ppl under $100...this is the hidden gem in the East Bay.  The whole roast duck is worth it alone!</review>

A little intimidating if you dont speak Chinese, however the staff will help you make choices since they dont come in carts.  Their is a large poster of pictures of the choices in case you don't know your favorite dim sum names.  Also,  be prepared. The portions they bring out are huge.

King Kong Dim Sum is a good spot for some solid Dim Sum in San Leandro. That said, if you're not chinese/ can't speak chinese, you might want to find another spot to go to, as it's tough to navigate the fast paced world of dim sum here and you might in the sea of dim sum if you're lost in translation!

That said, if you can find some chinese speaking friends to go with you, you'll have a great time! There are plenty of options and you can get the standard dim sum fare that you'd expect at a good dim sum place.<//Text>

<Text>Food is very authentic traditional Chinese  (too much so for my individual  taste).  But what makes it a bad restaurant is the wait staff.  Quite obnoxious and rude!  The real kicker is that two men were in the front doorway smoking, and their smoke completely filled the restaurant!   We had to leave it was so thick, and the staff couldn't figure out that this broke every county smoking ordinance on the book!<//Text>< pics>

The food is very good here. Their chow fun is a favorite of mine but my very favorite dish here is the shrimp and chives in tofu skin. Oh. Em. Gee. Plump shrimp in that salty and crispy wrapper is heaven in my mouth. Their various dumplings are on point, too: su mai, har gow, soy gow, etc. The prices are reasonable and if you go at the busy times the various dumplings and such are made fresh right then. My friend brought me here so I can't take credit for finding this sweet spot. I definitely think you should stop in and give them a try!</Text>

It's decent, not the greatest place, just the only place within the area that serves decent dim sum. I go here alot because it the only dim sum  around. Honestly it hits the spot if your lazy to go further. Selection is ordinary with a couple of specialties, but nothing to rave about. OK for locals, not worth the drive if it's out of the way.<//Text>

We paid $52 for 3 soups and Chow Mein
None of the food had any flavor....added soy sauce AND salt and no luck.
Chow mein was made with Angel hair pasta...??
I would not go back or recommend to anyone.
Place looks big and full, but its an illusion.
Hope this helped you.< /text>

For dim sum meh not bad.  But their stir fries are a little light on the proteins had to send a dish back.  A decent variety of dim sum dishes and they have chinese bbq you know the kind has dead animals hanging upside down.  Might be worth a visit because of the lack of food choices in San Leandro!<//review>

(Translated by Google) The environment is just like an older restaurant. The former Wangdian has become increasingly depressed due to the rise of new restaurants nearby. Most of the people who come here are elderly people. But I must say that the durian is really good. The durian is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. When the chopsticks clamp the outer skin, the durian filling inside slips out like milk, but the entrance is still rich in durian flavor, which is great. The barbecued pork puff pastry and salt water angle are also crunchy, while the other steamed dim sum is average. Most of the waiters have been here for a long time. They are very enthusiastic and like to chat with the old people about the housework, and they also help us to pack them seriously. Overall the price/performance ratio is quite high.

环境就一般啦像比较老的餐厅，曾经的旺店因为附近新餐厅的兴起而日渐消沉，来这里的人基本都是老人家。但是我必须说这家的酥真的很不错，榴莲酥外脆里嫩，筷子一夹外皮就断开里面的榴莲馅像牛奶一样滑出来，可是入口还是浓浓的榴莲味，棒棒的。还有叉烧酥和咸水角也是脆脆的，而其他蒸的点心就普通水平了。大多服务员在这里做很久了，很热情喜欢跟老人们聊家常，还帮我们认认真真的打包好。总的来说性价比挺高的。<//text>

< review>
(Translated by Google) They are just old Cantonese dishes, not new Cantonese dishes. The standard is very ordinary. The burning sauce is too oily, and it will become three high immediately after eating.

(Original)
他們只是舊式粤菜，並不是新派粤菜，水準很普通，燒味汁太油，食完馬上變三高，不是一個理想地方 .</review>

(Translated by Google) The food is average, please pay attention to the bills, the front desk and the waiter collude, and when you want snacks, they will give you more stamps and charge you more money. There is no human nature, shameless and despicable! watch your bill, they will add some food on your bill, and you will never see it on the table, charging more money! And they give different prices based on different persons! Shame on them! Bad humanity! I don't even wanna give a star! Come on, google!

(Original)
食物一般，千万注意账单，前台和服务员串通一气，等你要点心的时候多给你盖章多收你钱，没有人性简直，无耻卑劣到极点！watch your bill, they will add some food on your bill, and you will never see it on the table, charging more money! And they give different prices based on different persons! Shame on them! Bad humanity! I don’t even wanna give a star! Come on, google!</review>

I've photographed Red-Tailed Hawks, Great Egrets, Snowy Egrets (but no Snowy Owls!), even a Black Necked Stilt in recent years! I've even spotted a Long-Billed Curlew in these marshes, but PLEASE: this is a protected wildlife area: NO boats, canoes or the sorts, and no walking through the sandy areas. Stay on established paths and trails!! Also a fabulous place to catch a blazing Golden gate sunset!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
Crissy Field is part of an urban national park, which, due to its location and scenic views, is popular with both locals, tourists, and dogs.

Crissy Field reopened in 2001. New and rebuilt sidewalks, boardwalks, and trails connect the field north to Fort Point, the Warming Hut (a cafe), and south to the Crissy Field Center, an environmental education center, and the Marina District. Since that time many buildings were restored and leased out as housing, office space, retail, and recreational facilities. The old temporary wood barracks were demolished and the grass airfield restored. Letterman Army Hospital, a large concrete structure, literally was ground to dust and the concrete recycled. In its place George Lucas relocated Industrial Light & Magic.</Review>

<Text>We've been very impressed by the commitment and resilience of this organization even through a pandemic. The Los Angeles Boys & Girls Club is a pivotal resource for the community. This club has been distributing groceries to 300-400 Los Angeles families and senior citizens weekly.They've created virtual programming in art, photography, relationship smarts, dance, music production (amongst many others) and partnered with other orgs to create at-home art and craft kits for hundreds of at-risk Los Angeles youth. We are grateful community resources like this exist in times like these.< /Text><time>1596146956863<//time></record>

Several students have won multiple scholarships from companies and committies , but haven't received them from the clubs directors and management due to making their own rules! They first claim oh yes you will receive it if u do this, then the day comes for that and they give another excuse in why not to receive that scholarship. Sounds like scam or fraud??? Employees are underpaid as well, and not treated right. Management here always claims to say they are under budget and that they don't have money for their employees. Yet, this management keeps money to their selves first before having it to its truly recipients. Watch out for these 2 women : Juana and Carlyn. Big Scam !!!<//Review>

<response>{'time': 1599932015961, 'text': "We are very proud of all our scholarship recipients and glad we are able to connect youth to this kind of support for college.  Scholarship funds are distributed directly to the youth's college of choice.  Once a scholarship recipient enters college, they simply provide the college information and the scholarship funds will be directed to that college's financial aid office.  Again, we are proud of all Club scholarship recipients and understand it can be difficult to wait until entering college to get these well earned funds.  We are happy to help with the process of getting the scholarship funds transferred to the appropriate college if anyone is having difficulty.  Email:  info@labgc.org for assistance."}</response>< Gmap_id>

For my opinion it was a disaster. I didn't see no grown-ups taking care of the kids, I saw kids that around my daughter age (5 year old) going up and down the stairs with no supervision. There were just wondering around, I was so shock and left all scared seriously, maybe people will think  I'm over reacting but i wasn't gonna be conftreble at all leaving my little one, i mainly wanted it for My daughter to do fun things and activities, I was there for an hour just looking and see who was supervising or looking around at the main door. Anyone could just walk out with the kids or they could leave there selfs. I was so disappointed, I was really excited to take her, since I'm a single parent and for the summer every were is expensive and now I would have to see were can I leave her. So hard to trust people now in days.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

My cousin Paul went with Mr. Bashai last week and waited for three hours.  He unprofessionaly treated my cousin by not seeing him because he hadn;t gotten his Covid Vaccination.  He lives in a home and was required to vaccinate immediatley. My cousin is unable to speak for himself or and his helpers were told they could go to CVS to have his blood pressure medication.  He is now having to look for a new doctor and no medicine that could cause him to yet get another stroke.<//text>

<text>I'd just like to say first, Dr. Bichai is a very nice man and extremely pleasant and I appreciate that about him. My reason for the 1 star review surrounds the very finicky nature of this practice. I am a Medical Assistant that works in a medical office for an Orthopedic Surgeon so, I have a very good idea of how a medical practice should work and this office is the antithesis of a good medical office. Three times my appointment was canceled with no phone call to inform me. When I showed up for my appointment I was told that I had been called about the cancelation and that simply wasn't the truth for any of those 3 times. I don't lightly call people dishonest but it's extremely clear when I show them my phone and let them see with their own eyes that I never received a call from them. I had an appointment for today and was called (finally) to let me know the appointment was canceled because "The doctor isn't coming in today." That makes zero sense to me that a doctor just picks days when patients are scheduled not to come in. That isn't a valid excuse at this point. Out of 6 appointments that I've had scheduled at this practice, I have only seen the doctor twice. Then, to add, you literally have to plan your day around going to an appointment here. The last time I was successful in seeing the doctor, my mother and I waited in the waiting room for 5 hours until we saw the doctor. No, I'm not exaggerating, exactly 5 hours. Then we waited for another hour in the back to be seen by the doctor. It was nighttime by the time we left. You can see how frustrating this can be  especially when you know how a medical practice should actually be run. I really do adore Dr. Bichai and think he's a great guy but I can't recommend a practice that continually cancels on its patients that have waited months to see the doctor.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80ea69a286920917:0x3f46fad96dd312c5< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Doctor Bichai really listen my concerns.
He really cares about my health, he looks deep into my health problems and find the solution.
Also, I saw other patients walking out with bags full of samples, Dr. Bichai is very generous.
The waiting is well worth it, to see the best doctor in town.</text>

<Review>I had an appointment scheduled for 11:30. I sat in the waiting room for over 2 hours before I was called back. I was triaged and sent to another waiting room. It has now been 4 hours since my scheduled appointment and I am STILL in the waiting room. What is the point of scheduling an appointment if I am not going to be seen for over 4 hours or more.

So after waiting a total of 5 hours and still hadn't seen the doctor, I requested my medical records and walked out. I have never had such a terrible experience with a doctors office. The ER would have been faster and more efficient.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Rate>

<text>I feel Dr. Bichai really takes time to listen to what I have to say. Although there is a long wait time it's well worth it to have a Dr. LIKE him that makes me feels like he actually cares about my well being and is always thanking me for coming in to his office  unlike others I've had before him.< /text>< Pictures>

<gmap_id>0x80ea69a286920917:0x3f46fad96dd312c5</gmap_id><Text>Outstanding in his field. He is more then my Dr. He is my friend he makes sure im ok he listens and asks me how im feeling his staff are like family members who are concerned about me. Dr. B is a very fine dr and believes in God. Has bible versus on all the patients rooms. He provides coffee and big screen tv. He gives me Truffles and food. He really cares. However the wait can be extremely long hours and sometimes he cancels then i have to reschedule then my meds are past due and i end up being in pain. Dr. Bichai and his wife work together her name is Elizabeth and she is very knowledgeable in her field and she is very sweet she says hi to me reminds me of Snow White beautiful and smart . Dr Bichai gives me yummy treats this Thanksgiving he has ordered me an icecream cake. He treats me like family i love my Dr and the staff. About every third visit is rescheduled i take stong meds so i end up waiting for days to just get refills.  I understand he is very busy wish he had a partner who can fill in when hes out of the office.  That is the only problem I have.  I love my Dr. Bichai. Today was Carpaccio cake BOMB is Dr. B. Today 5/2/19 Dr. Bichai gave me 2 lg pieces of chocolate cake Ashley made . This is my family did you notice Dr. Bichai has Keurig coffees for his patients way to go my  wonderful Dr. 7/25/19 once again he made my tastebuds dance with joy, cappuccino icecream cake two pieces and omg hit the spot on a blistering hot day. I love my Dr. Bichai and all the office people.  ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>I'm only leaving a star because I have to leave a rating, but he honestly doesn't deserve a star at all.
The wait is hours, I had an appointment at 1:10 PM and didn't get seen until 6 PM. I went in and got your normal blood pressure, temperature and weight taken down on the chart just to get told to go back to the waiting room. I waited another hour and was finally taken to a room. I waited for him for 30+ minutes and when I saw him he tried to push sleep apnea on me and told me that if I didn't take my medicine like he said I would die.
He doesn't listen to you when you try to explain what is going on with you and shuts you down to give you his explanation as to what's wrong with you.
I don't recommend this doctor at all. I've seen him once a month for 4 months and it's always the same thing.
I have really tried to be positive when I come to see him but he just frustrates me so much and I can't take it anymore.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

After reviewing everyone elses comments im wondering if we see the same doctor because every single appt i have made my mother, if it was even kept in the system was cancelled on us or rescheduled. We have not gotten any help at any appt except one diagnosis that im almost 100% positive is incorrect due to other observation of medical professionals.  The doctor is very nice but all over the place, constantly chewing gum while talking about serious health issues (not professional) and the staff is horrible at actually making appts for the right time or day. Then want to try blaming it on the patient that we didn't answer the phone when calling to reschedule us. Heres a suggestion, dont make a wrong appt in the first place make sure you know your doctor will be available and actually in the office on the day of his scheduled time. Along with keep the number i have been giving the past year with no change at all. I would not recommend this place, based on lack of communication with one another along with their patients who are needing to be seen. Oh and having to wait 4 plus hrs is just ridiculous. The ONE appt we actually did get into took from 1230p to 445p. Yes! This long of a wait and only waited this long because it was a must to be seen at the time.<//Text>

<Text>Im not reviewing Dr. Bichai, because I never got the chance to see Bichai. I went to his office two times and waited over three hours both times. When I asked why I haven't been seen, I was told that "the doctor likes to talk to his patients." If you have to see him in a work day I would recommend taking the whole day off, packing a lunch and some drinks, because you will be waiting a long time.<//Text>< pictures>

There is a large selection of fashionable women's dresses to choose from. I liked how light the lamps were. Employees had always taken care of their customers. It was the most enjoyable shopping experience I've ever had.< /review>

They have imported and local wines that you can buy for a very affordable price. For me, this is the best place to hang out with friends or maybe loved ones. They also offered some flavored chips and nuts.< /text>

<text>One of the best car shows in Orange County. They meet early on Saturday's. Gear heads, great selection of hot rods and super cars, rock music, fun happy atmosphere and friendly people.

One of the places to stop by if you're a tourist and you've never been to San Francisco.  I grew up in the bay so I would always visit this place when my relatives from the Philippines would come visit us. I love this place, I love being by the ocean. It isn't as cool as the beach but it's nice walking on the pier.< /Review>

A big thank you to Alex for assisting me last Friday. I never thought this Grocery shop would be this useful for my needs. All of my worries were gone now. He assisted me with my concerns professionally, and everything I badly need to buy was already right here. A contented and satisfied customer here! Awe-inspiring!< /review>

Every week they have a series of happy hours in the food court and some type of art installation or live music.
Went to see Tuxedo last week and it was hopping. A huge crowd that couldn't help dancing to the cool grooves of Mayer Hawthorne.</Review>< Pictures>

Sad looking mall due to Nordstrom's no longer being an anchor store. I only go there because it has the AMC Theaters. Park on the 4th level in the parking structure to be on the same level as the movie theater.<//text>

Pleasant stroll with an Ocean Breeze.  This is the perfect way so spend a lazy Saturday or Sunday afternoon.  Stroll through the shops, lunch at Javiers for the delicious and energy.</Review>

< Review>
You gotta give it to this shopping center--they do an amazing job of programming! In conjunction with Arts Brookfield, they manage to pull in some of LA's most interesting artists.
Every week they have a series of happy hours in the food court and some type of art installation or live music.
Went to see Tuxedo last week and it was hopping. A huge crowd that couldn't help dancing to the cool grooves of Mayer Hawthorne.< /Review>

I really liked this area. There is a lot of shopping options that would make this a place you can get everything on your list taken care of for the most part. I felt it was upscale and a safe neighborhood to come to. I love everything about California, residents are extremely lucky to live in such an incredible state. I hope when I get closer to retirement I too can call California home. Especially a place close to the beach.<//Review>

Good selection of shops and restaurants. Very crouded on weekends. Navigating the parking lot and surrounding roads will make you wish the locals driving manners were as nice as their cars.<//Text>

This is the best Z Pizza location and they serve some amazing chicken wings with special styles like pesto and sweet chili.
Great prices for what you get. Plus, the staff is always real friendly and keep the place nice and clean.<//review>

It's got what you need!

It reminds me of a local mall but it has so much more of a view profound friendliness. I would go out of your way but I would say you should stop if it is in your way. Javier's and Trader Joe's makes it</review>

Kind of a place where the sales associates turn their noses up to customers and thats not my kind of place. Even if I go with money to spend, I won't spend ot at places like this. Respect is a hallmark of customer service. Don't expect it at these stores. Over priced and lacking in social skills. Waste of time in my book.</Text>

With the addition of wifi and more outdoor seating, this place has earned a spot in my usual routine when I am home visiting. This place has a wide array food options (ranging from ultra high end to mid tear), great shopping, Trader Joe's and plenty of parking. It is very close to Crystal Cove State Park and makes a beach picnic very easily assessable.</text>

Very nice shopping center. Starbucks is good place to hang out and work on laptop. Bear fish company is delicious for lunch. Trader Joe's is usually pretty quiet.< /text>

I love the location, but I'm just not excited about the retail stores offered.  A nice ocean view and upscale modern architecture, makes the experience more appealing.  Lots of comfortable outdoor seating are available to relax or eat between shopping.< /text>

Located across the street from Crystal Cove State Park. You can sit outside on comfortable seating and watch the sunset over the Pacific.< /Review><userid>115932348043395405444< /userid>< gmap_id>

Nice place but needs more variety and more outdoor seating.  We had to walk a bit and others had to wait.  Might just depend on the time of day.  Also, might need to do something about the birds.  I was attacked by one but no harm done.<//text>

<review>Great shopping center which has amazing views of the ocean which can make your shopping experience more enjoyable. Lots of nice stores like Banana Republic, Gap, Pier One and yes even a Trader Joes. There are also restaurants here is you wish to get something to eat. Really beautiful and clean, wonderful views and the cool ocean breeze.</review></record>

Would you like to see women that have had a lot of plastic surgery? Perhaps people who drive Ferraris daily? Then this is the place to go. A lot of excellent restaurants and really nice shops highly recommended but a tad pretentious.< /Text>

What a great place to grab a Starbucks, park the car and wrap up the days action items & emails on Ipad, after a long day of sales calls.  Just sitting in the car, windows down, looking at the ocean, feeling peace.a happy place.<//text>

This is a great rehabilitation center to go to in Newport Beach if you're really looking for quality help to get clean. I really found myself here and why I even started using in the first place. Long story short, their addiction treatment program works because they personalize it to your particular problem and your needs.< /review>

Go for the Trader Joe's. Stay for the Javier's.
Even though I miss Pacific Whey Cafe being at this location, I still come for the diverse shopping and dining options.<//Text>

Fru fru to the max. Just the thing for wealthy locals, who can see the parking lot from their back yards. Great Trader Joe's with really nice staff. A couple of very pricey high end eateries. The typical Starbucks. Not much else for average people. The rent must be insane. You can see some exotic cars often with the Cars and Coffee meetups. Kind of Beverly Hills OC. Interesting people watching.<//review>

Beautiful architecture for these shopping places. Plenty of food (seafood, pizza, ect.) drinks (Starbucks, Boba?), home decor, and Trader Joe's. If you're staying at the Crystal Cove this is definitely a great place to stop and get food and supplies.</text>

<Review>I come here often, usually to shop at Trader Joe's. I also like to stop in at Pier One or Williams-Sonoma or one of the clothing shops. There are several great restaurants too including Marche Moderne, which just opened recently. If you haven't tried it, you should check it out; it's a great restaurant.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80dce14b06fcf21d:0x831d235cf79cbc60</gmapID></record>

There is a Trader Joes in the Crystal Cove Shopping Center along with a Starbucks.  So if you need some coffee and a few snacks for a trip into south Orange County or north, this is a good place to stop into.<//review>

The local Starbuck has a very nice patio and Javier's is one of the best Mexican restaurants in the area.
