Best pizza in the Sacramento area, in quality, quantity, and price. Do yourself a favor and check them out. I used to treat myself to Round Table, Mountain Mikes, and BJ's, but they are all way too over priced. That, and the service and quality of food I've received from them has been sub par at best (see my previous reviews). But Original Pizza House? I've been ordering from them now for over four years, and I've not once had a bad experience, bad customer service, or bad food. So yummy! So fresh! I'm in pizza heaven! <3</review>

Great selection of pizza. Ordered a 20" and it was closer to 24" HUGE. They also threw in a free 2 liter. They had great service and showed that they value the customer.<//Text>

<text>Been coming here for years now.
Service has been pretty good and orders have come out quick unless they are super busy.

Pizzas have been good. Lots of options and some pretty good gourmet pizzas too. Try the lamb pizza or creat your own masterpiece.

The calzones are also good.

They always have deals from the flyer or just call and ask.

The sides are a a hit or miss from being cooked good or just not being in stock.

If you pick it up and spend $20+ they give you a free 2 liter of your choice.<//text>< Pics>

So called 3 times, first 2 was hung up on. The third time was asked to hold, they just put the phone down, so I could hear everything they were saying. 3 more people called in and the line was answered all 3 times and orders were made. So my girl called them up they answered. She explained to them what happened. They were like sorry can you place the order now. Thats it. So I asked for a manager they said sorry we don't have one but we can give you 10% off. I can still hear them on the other line!!! Lol... the guy was talking mad s%!+.. are you serious? I was literally on hold for 17 minutes after they hung up on her call. It sucks because I actually really like this place. Staff not so much today.< /Text>

<Text>If you want a generous amount of toppings, excellent crust, and a clean environment check out Original Pizza!  It was my first time there. We ordered the Hawaiian. It's made with Canadian bacon instead of crumbled bacon. Extra cheese and plenty of pineapple.  It was excellent!  I can hardly wait to try one of their specialty pizzas. I'm going for the Taco pizza next.  The server was very helpful, pleasant and knowledgable. I mistakenly ordered the wrong size and am glad I did!!  OMG!  Sooo goood!😋 😋😋😋😋<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Usually everything is hot and ready in the time frame given whilst placing your order.   It seems that when business is slower (slower than their normal rush for dinner or lunch), when you arrive at the time quoted,  it seems like the pizza may have gotten done a bit early and isn't as hot and fresh as normal.   They have just gotten me used to such excellent quality that when it isn't,  it is very evident.   They have the best prices around, especially for the superior quality, and their pizza and cheese-bread reminds me of the pizzerias back home.   Some other pizzerias, I won't mention names,  taste more like a 'fast food' pizza rather than the very fresh mozzarella,.sauce and crust that Original Pizza has.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

This pizza place is amazing, I always order my pizza from Original Pizza House and it always come out amazing. I will never go to a different pizza place now. I really recommend for people to come here and buy the pizza. They also have wings and bread sticks that I recommend you guys to try.<//Review>

<Text>I am super disappointed in my visit today. I popped in to grab wings and cheesy bacon bread but had to run to the restroom inside the restaurant. I placed my order and told the cashier I'd be right back. She gave me the code to the bathroom door I went in did my business and came back to pay. The girl behind the counter advised I could pay when the order was ready. She said it would be approximately 15 to 20 minutes. Almost 40 minutes later I approached the counter and asked about the status of my order. Neither of the girls at the counter knew what I was talking about. Apparently, the girl who took my order had left for the day and did not put my order in. The girl working the counter said it was because I didn't pay. I am beyond tired, hungry and frustrated. I won't be back.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x809ad7a7abb0bab1:0xad8b093b7e6adeb9< /gmap_id></record>

Great pizza at an amazing price! Ordered a veggie pizza and jalapeno cheese bread! Both tasted awesome! Ended up getting two more orders for the family on the way out. Totaling (30ish) for all orders! The price is below expectations from usual pizza eat in. I would definitely eat again. Location is sub-par in a plaza, but building is new and interior is decently updated. Soda was very limited, they were out of most common syrup when we went. Pizza quality made up for it.</Text>

The pizza here is great which is why they got a 3 star rating, but their customer service need some realigning. I made my initial order of cheese bread with bacon, wings and a 2 liter soda and when it was delivered, the cheese bread had no bacon and the soda was never delivered. When I called they sent out a new order of cheese bread and the soda but I believe the driver dropped it as you can see in the photo. I'm not even going to bother and call to let them know thus why I'm posting this review.<//Review>

<review>We have a great meal for an affordable price. We usually get 3 extra large pizzas when the whole family gets together and everyone is satisfied. The garlic cheesy bread is the best. I recommend the calzones their delicious. Thanks for a great service and delicious food.< /review>< date>

<Review>Extremely courteous staff. They go that extra effort when it comes to customer service. Very clean facility kitchen to the restrooms. Great Pizza and menu items very reasonably priced. I highly recommend take out, dine in, or delivery. I most certainly will be a returning customer.< /Review>< pics>

Horrible.
They were an hour late on my first delivery with them and the manager called and offered us a pizza for free. Today we went to redeem the pizza and was asked “Why didn’t you guys tell us anything was wrong with the pizza?” When I explained the situation she seemed annoyed and was extremely disrespectful that we were calling to redeem for the free pizza.
Sad because the pizza was good but the customer service is lacking.<//Text>

Great pizza,  they have plenty of choices,  then you have to decide how much to take home by deciding the size of pie you want from small personal to Huge party size. If you dine in bring a metal knife they only offer plastic which will melt with how hot the pizza is coming out of the oven.  The store is a little dated hopefully the renovate soon.  They are in a easy to miss location,  sorry if you do.  I do wish you could choose how thick the crust is.< /Text>

I used to live close to this pizza joint. I happened to be passing by, and stopped in for a pizza.

They still have the best crust in Sacramento. And the best prices.<//Review>

The entire  staff and drivers saw an ice cream truck and ran outside, leaving me alone in the restaurant. 10 minutes later they all come back with ice cream  cones. This is ridiculous, can't believe this happened to me.
teens are very easy to distract. pizza was good though<//review>

<Review>Nothing negative to say about my first experience with Original Pizza House. Our order was for pickup. Which was very fast. We were told 20 minutes for a large pizza, garlic cheese bread, fries, and mozzarella sticks. Great price for so much food. Fast timing. Food was good. Will definitely come again.</Review>< Pics>

<review>Large 1 topping for $10! Second visit and I will return. I have ordered the special both visits with salami as my 1 topping and an order of cheesy garlic bread well done.  Excellent both times.  Super friendly staff, made to order, plates/napkins and free ranch, bonus is they are open late for pick up!  Next visit I'm skipping the special and will try one of they're signiture pizzas.  This place is definitely overlooked, wish I would have tried it sooner.  Thanks Original Pizza House for your excellent customer service.</review></record>

I'm an expert on pizza having worked at Pizza hut, round table, the mendo pizzaria ,as well as countless mom and pop joints around northern California... My favorite places for pizza include the marina pizzaria in San Francisco, piazzanos in Reno, and now here original pizza house... This place knows pizza with a huge selection of specialties that is diverse and delish, the service is friendly enough for take out orders so far... I have yet to sit in but I'm definitely going to, just to have the experience of doing so I've included a picture of the inside that I took the first time I went while I was waiting for my order to be prepared... I just finished the second pizza I've ordered and I will definitely be a regular...<//text>

Everything is fresh. The crust of the pizza is what I like best, there crust has that crispness that is just devilish delicious. And the cheese sticks-- it is on point, it is everything that you lust for. It is cheesy inside and out, each bit melts in your mouth.

All i can say is this: even when your full, the food here is so good that you want to continue on eating.</Text>

Did a order for pickup. The over the phone order placement was smooth and no hassle whatsoever. After arriving, the wait time was only a couple mins and was ready as soon as I got there. Good is great tasting and and no hassle ordering is worthy of 5 stars. Will definitely be going back and will be  recommending it.< /text>

This is by far the best pizza I have tried. It can't even be compared to other popular pizza places by the quality and taste. The service they give is exceptional. Also, the place itself gives a feeling as if you are in a little Italian village, making it the most Original Pizza House out there.</Text>

Pleasant and delicious. The extra garlic added so much wonderful flavor as I know I like and the wings were just right spice and tenderness. Most of all it was a done dough pizza, and sometimes that is not the case in other restaurants.. Last but not least it was delivered in a very timely manner. Thank you for your excellent home-style Italian Pizza!< /review>

<text>The pizza was delicious. I waited in the store for them to finish my order. They quoted me 30 minutes for pickup. I showed up after 25 minutes and waited another 20-25 minutes at least. It wasn't very busy and the employees showed no sense of urgency while I was waiting. I otherwise enjoyed the meal.</text><user_id>116910126794131421955<//user_id></record>

We were tired and hungry . I hope they will get it together soon.</text>

The staff is friendly & greet u when u enter the establishment. There is about a 15-20 wait for your food & postmates will deliver to your front door!!! The largest pizza they sell is a party size that is 36 slices & it's on special.<//text>

<Review>Quick delivery and fresh veggies!

Ordered at 7:23 pm on a Friday, friendly driver was on my doorstep at 7:50.

The pizza was hot, the meat ratio was perfect and the veggies were fresh!

I will be ordering again very soon!< /Review></record>

not the same owners as before, ain't here about 5 years ago it was great, go in today at noon on 7 17 18 and it sucked, couldn't even place an order, the girl behind the counter told me they don't put sausage in a calzone, not Italian at all, sausage is one of the most traditional items in a calzone, all you have to do is cook it on the side first before you put it in so it Cooks all the way through, these Russians have no idea about pizza, will not be going back< /Text>

<text>Got a large with peperoni bacon and mushroom but the only thing I can taste was the mushrooms. The garlic cheese bread has no flavor and the ranch is water downed. Everything a pon delivery was cold except the wings. Best part was the wings. Next time that's all I'm gonna order.< /text>< pics>

We ordered a pizza and buffalo fries.  They told us 45-55 minutes.  No problem.  After an hour and ten minutes we called back to see why the delay.  The lady said that they had been trying to contact us for over an hour to tell us that they were out of buffalo sauce even though we had no voicemails on our phones.  Cancelled our order because it would have taken another hour to get a pizza to us.</review>

<text>This place has gone down hill since the first of the year. Today was the absolute worst. 9 whole pieces of sausage on a large pepperoni and sausage pizza? the pepperoni was as scarce as well. Called to complain they could NOT care less. After years of trying to support this local business I will find another pizza place after all living in Natomas Pizzas and pizza places are literally a dime a dozen, even more so then Liquor stores.
As for the taste, again this place used to be GREAT like What a pizza in Carmichael, now it taste's like wonder bread with V8 juice poured on it.< /text><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x809ad7a7abb0bab1:0xad8b093b7e6adeb9< /gmap_id><Pictures>None<//Pictures><UserId.>118248956248294370269<//UserId.></record>

< Review>
terrible customer service I've been asked to "call back when they weren't busy" twice. the two times I actually got to place an order I've gotten cold pizza. the first time, I let it slide, the second time I ordered I let them know about the cold pizza on the first delivery, not to get something free, only hoping to have a warm pizza this time, nope! fool me twice, shame on me< /Review>

Great playground for kids.. covered so the playground doesn't get too hit or rained on. Lots of room for the kids/pets to run around. Plus bathrooms.<//Review>

I have only gone in the morning during the week a handful of times and there have been numerous situations that I do not approve. We will not be back to this park.</review>< pics>

My wife and I enjoy coming down the Hill to vist this park.  We walk and  brush the dog and have time to meet the neighbors and watch some soccer occasionally.  My problem is the disrespect some people show by not picking up their dog dropping or throwing out the trash.<//Review>

Pretty decent park. The kids like the large field and I like that there are clean, well-stocked restrooms on site. There are also several large park benches for picnics, and the playground equipment has a shade cover.

Two disadvantages: there are only baby swings,  (not swings for the big kids) and there are often shady people passing through. The proximity to the freeway make the parking lot a desirable location for people to do suspicious things. Other than that, the park itself is okay.< /Text>

<Review>Fantastic rental experience! Bill went above and beyond in helping me select an RV parking spot and an indoor storage unit with A/C. He made the signup process easy and efficient.  I love that you can even control access gate opening/closing with the app using your own, unique code. Slick! Since I just began the rental experience yesterday, I'll try to update after a fashion to let you know how the tenancy is going. Cheers, j</Review>< pics>

<user_name>Jenalee Dean<//user_name><Date>1622740031006< /Date><Rating>5<//Rating><review>We rented a space for a little over a month recently to store a trailer. The day of the drop off, we were running very close to closing time and Tamika was just so wonderful and patient, waiting for our arrival and staying a few minutes late to make sure we were able to check in and park it. We would have otherwise had no where to store it. She was amazing from the day we checked in to the day we checked out. She was incredibly friendly, professional, and welcoming. I would totally rent from there again if the need would arise. Thanks again Tamika!!< /review>< pics>

<review>Came to see a parking space with my husband, and Tamika was very helpful. She didn't rush us, even though we came close to closing. She also explained the online rental process perfect. Very refreshing in these trying times to be provided with excellent customer service! Look forward to working with her in the near future.< /review>< Pics>

Due to covid 19 I lost my home and my mind. I needed to store all my things in a short amount of time I went onto the property in hope that something was available. TAMIKA the property manager was so much help! she found the perfect space for me that wasn’t too small and wasn’t too big and was perfectly in my price range. She made everything so easy! The property seems to keep the property very clean and in an orderly fashion. I recommend everyone store with her.< /text>

Yolanda was very sweet and informative, and made sure I understood all the details with billing and move in process. There was one other girl working in the office (I didn’t get her name), and the two ladies provided such a friendly environment. From my experience so far, I highly recommend this Public Storage Facility.<//Review>

I set up a new unit with Lauren - what a professional great experience!  Lauren did a great job setting me up, reviewing and explaining all the documents and answering my questions.  Lauren and I conducted a review on the actual unit, and she made it a point to confirm that everything was clean and ready to move in.  This property is clean and secure, I would recommend for anyone looking to find a unit.</Text>

Lauren was tremendously helpful with closing out my son’s unit. He forgot to replace the lock, taking it with him before our last trip. She loaned us a lock and key to use until he returned he following day. It was at no charge!  Above and beyond!  We are grateful. Thanks.<//Text>

I needed to empty a storage unit into a POD Storage container. As I do not live in the area I called ahead to figure out all of the logistics of when/where to have the POD dropped off and picked up etc. I spoke with Lauren the manager on the phone multiple times and she was extremely helpful and courteous on the phone, as well as wonderfully patient with my many questions and concerns.
Upon arrival on the day of the POD drop off. Lauren greeted us with the same kindness and informative recommendations of expertise. During the two days of unloading and loading into the POD, Lauren and Olivia both were very helpful with our many more questions regarding the move.
The whole moving experience was quite daunting at first but was eased by the helpful professionalism of the Public Storage team. Thank you so much for the great experience Lauren and Olivia.<//Review>

<Text>I reserved a unit a 2 days ago and just when I finally got the chance to start moving stuff into the unit, I found I was unable to get access to it due to painting and construction and was told that is going to be all month. The manager should have told me before I paid. And to make this better , I got an email for a bill for next month. Don't do business here. I've already regretted this.</Text>< Pictures>

Lauren was very helpful and knowledgeable! I came in looking to purchase boxes, sounds simple, right? She recommended sizes that would better suit what I needed and sold me on a few more items that I didn’t even think of! If I ever need a storage space I will definitely come here or refer anyone I know in need of a space! Genuine, friendly managers like her are hard to find!<//review>

<review>Lauren (the manager) is amazing. Moving out of state has been super hectic but she has done whatever she can to make sure my experience at Public Storage goes smoothly. She’s super friendly, accommodating, and professional. The facilities have been clean, and the location is really convenient. I frequently see her or other employees walking through the buildings (presumably to check locks) and they definitely monitor the gate to make sure no one is there who shouldn’t be.

My only complaint is that the lights turn off if you’ve been in one spot for awhile (they’re motion activated), so trying to repack things in my storage unit required running back and forth to the beginning of the hallway when the lights turned off. (I was there for several hours and had to do this a number of times.) A minor annoyance that shouldn’t be an issue for most people.</review>< Pics>

The only negative, is a negative for the entire industry: aggressive rental fee increases.  However, I would highly recommend Public Storage on Hookston Rd. in Pleasant Hill. Ask for Lauren!<//text>< Pictures>

Lauren was awesome from start to finish. She promptly called me to confirm my reservation and set up a time to come in and get me all checked in. When I arrived she quickly showed me the units, suggested things I may need and then processed my paperwork quickly. She had an incredible attention to detail and was fast and efficient. I have rented at several places because of my business and Lauren's high level of customer service was refreshing and much appreciated!</Review>

<text>Lauren was fantastic. Very knowledgeable and extremely professional. I would give her 5 stars but overall, I’d give the business 3 stars due to the high prices of their storage units. I moved out today and I am happy I did so I can save on the price for next month.</text></record>

Lock out and late fee policys have always been horrid.  The lack of response to COVID-19 has pushed thier corporate polices into no less than a draconian state.  Conflicting emails, text messages, unclear polices about the effect of monies recieved, constant harassing calls are all part of the wretched customer experience if you should be so unfortunate as to dare miss a payment.    Cant give zero stars or I would.<//review>

<text>I've used this location, for years - excellent service, very clean, very secure. I ended my rental purely because I don't need it anymore, but.I will definitely return if I need more storage again! Also, great online billing services, very handy! It's a bit out of the way, but that's good, less traffic in and out!</text>< name>

I would think twice before renting from this place. First of all the rent is very high and even if you rent a big space that will accommodate an extra vehicle, they won’t allow it, they raise the rent every few months without giving you plenty of notice to find a more affordable place, they don’t prorate the rent so if you don’t leave by the 1st of month then you have to pay the whole month (no exceptions). There are more affordable places out there. Debbie was the only good about that place. Thank you Debbie.</text>

Great service. Lauren the property manager is really attentive and professional. She secured me a 10x10 storage unit within 15 mins of arrival-this included knocking out the paperwork, payment and touring the unit. She is very knowledgeable and I highly recommend this Public Storage off Hookston/Bancroft because of her excellent customer service. A++<//text>

Alejandra and Victoria are both helpful and friendly. These are two hard working ladies. I initially got a small unit and have now upgraded. The switch was easy and fairly fast. They are both very explanatory, making everything clear prior to having customers sign the paperwork, and when I've had to call them, they are very professional and clear in their answers. I chose this location because it's close to home, but I will remain at this location because of the service and the good vibes!<//Text>

Just moved out after long-term rental of both locker and parking space. I can heartily recommend them. The staff has always been helpful on the rare occasion there were issues. My (interior) locker was pest free (even after a LONG time, with clothes!) and the facilities have always been clean. I was there fairly frequently the last few months and was always greeted with a smile and a "hello" whenever staff passed me anywhere on the premises. Security is also good, my car was never damaged or otherwise messed with even when I myself neglected it for long stretches. A good experience overall. Kudos!  If I need storage in the area again, I would use them. If a friend needed storage in the area, I would recommend them.< /review>

<text>I came in looking for a small locker to store our extra Luggage and Briefcases while our home gets remodeled. While there were not many small lockers available here, Both Anthony and Alejandra were very nice and unlike some places that we visited earlier in the day they were not pushy or trying to force us to choose them and even helped me look into nearby places that may better suit my needs.
Great customer service and will recommend to anyone!</text>< time>

Just signed up for a 10x15 with Lauren, she is a delight - super helpful, positive! According to Lauren the manager, this site has recently shortened hours and is live-security monitored by Stealth, and since she has been managing this location since Oct 2018 there have been zero breakins.<//Review>

She and the rest of the staff are quick to answer questions about products and services, complete your transaction, and always take a few extra moments for some pleasant conversation.  The facility is very clean, well-lit, and secure.  I highly recommend this location for your storage needs.</text>< Pics>

I recently moved and in the process of doing so lost the key to my storage unit. When I talked to Lauren at the Public Storage on Hookston  Road in Pleasant Hill, she was friendly and professional, and she gave me several options for removing the lock.  I was able to get a locksmith to meet me at my unit the same day. Lauren was incredibly accommodating; she scheduled a 30 minute window when she would definitely be available and even rescheduled that window when the locksmith was running late. When we and the locksmith arrived, Lauren accompanied us to the unit. She was incredibly helpful and did everything with a smile! It ended up being a really great experience instead of a huge hassle mostly due to Lauren’s support.</Review>

<date>1562726063064< /date><rate>5<//rate><Text>I had 5:15 appointment with Lauren to rent a storage unit on July 3rd.    Traffic was absolutely horrendous on the freeway with everyone getting out of town for July 4th and I was running really late, a little worried that I wouldn't get there before they closed.     Called her to let her know and she said no problem.   Arrived just before closing time at 6pm.   She was very quick and efficient in showing me the unit, and then going thru the rental terms, while explaining all the important details.    The entire process took under 15 minutes, and combined with her pleasant and friendly personality,  it was truly painless !<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I will forever be appreciative of all the help the staff has provided me, and especially when I was faced with an eviction by my landlord of 15 years.  Without provocation, Jan Fuchs issued me an eviction notice in the middle the winter months, when it is now raining almost weekly and informed me without reason that I had to move.  A veteran on disability, this wasn't so easy a proposition to approach.  But with the help of support of the staff like Debby, I was at least able to face the prospect with some sense of support.  Thank you.  Always,<//Review>

I was told I had to get insurance through them for the unit because most rental insurance policies do not cover storage units, which was untrue. Also, they raised the rental price on the unit after six months, another thing I did not know....seems to be a lot of misinformation. Prefer if they were honest and upfront. Do not get insurance with them if you have rental insurance- you are most likely covered.< /Text>

Very unhappy,  my friends unit is on this site and he showed it to me when we went to leave we had trouble with the gate, we asked the manager Lauren to help , she was rude and blamed us for the gate not opening. His rent is paid and his code is good she was very disrespectful. Im not renting with public storage.< /Review>

Rebecka was a delight to work with.  She made the process of moving from a smaller space that we rented the day before to a more appropriate space.  Thank you Rebecka.< /Review>

I just have to brag about the wonderful customer service I've just received from a young woman named Allisa. She was super patient with me, being that I'm dead and its hard for me to hear. I wanted to downsize my unit from a 10+10 to a 5+5. She found me a unit not to far from my old one. Thanks Allisa for the world class customer service.</Review>

<username>Tom Marx</username><Time>1371932656855< /Time><Rate>4< /Rate><text>When I found the location online and then the size of storage place I wanted, it was easy to reserve online and I immediately able to go to Hookston Road and get set up.  I picked an interior space with climate control to protect some of my fragile items.  The man who set me up and brought me to the space was friendly and helpful.

From there on I was pretty much on my own, entering a code to open the gate, then another code to enter the building my space was in. My space was clean and had one opverhead light on a pull chain which was farily adequate for my needs.
When I needed a dolly, it was readily available.

After a few months, I was moving out of the area and went to the office to check on how to give notice.  Again, everyone was helpful and courteous.  I have never had any problems at this Public Storage location and appreciated the friendly staff.  If I were to need storage again, I would look up the closest Public storage.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x8085613d79cbdcfd:0x722cfaf19f9d05d< /Gmap_id></record>

Victoria and Alejandra were both in the office and were happy to help. They took me on a tour of the site in a golf cart. They showed me various sizes and help me figure out the best size and price for my needs. Over all it was a positive experience and I learned a lot which will help my storage needs. I would write all the tips they gave me but I will not steel their thunder. Go talk to Victoria and Alejandra yourself and be surprised at what you need before choosing a storage facility.

Worst place to go. I asked how long the waiting list was and no one answered me one of the employees was right in front of me and I asked her she picked up the phone and started talking to someone and then when she hung up I looked at her and she just walked away. Honestly No class and it's very dirty never going there again<//Text>

Called to make an appointment with the owner of the salon but she's on vacation so I made it the other lady next to her. When I arrived she sends me with another lady because she is still attending clients, so what's the point of making appointments.< /text>

<review>I came here and had the most rude and racist treatment. Was told to leave by a older bearded man even though i had already paid. Got no money back and no reason. He threatened to call police at one point because i said why if i already paid. He just wasnt having it and said he was on the board and didnt want me here and he was authorized to tell me to leave.  Aside from that i spoke to someone who was outside and was told they dont even have food handlers cards.  Will never return and dont recomend this place.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< GmapID>

This was a place I went with a friend to help her sort some food. It is a food pantry that meets on one day a week. They also deliver food to those who can't come and pick it up the kindness in the people's hearts there is very moving.</review>

My favorite shop in San Diego to get tattooed. Mischa’s work is amazing ! Super bold colors and perfect lines, I love that he always gets so excited about my tattoo ideas. The walls are lined with so much flash it’ll keep you busy through all the painful spots while you sit but seriously I cannot say enough wonderful things

*this is a healed photo< /review>

Mischa is a great artist, he has a good eye for what will work on your body to really make sure the tattoo you get looks great on you. I am so happy with my tattoo I got from him and will definitely get another one from him. Clean place, professional staff, quality work, and plenty of parking in that area of downtown. Highly recommend!</review>

<Name>cali minchin<//Name><text>I came to California to visit family with hopes of getting a tattoo to "stamp" my visit. We stopped into Seven Seas pretty late and they ended up fitting all three of us in. The staff was extremely friendly and assertive. Mischa was my artist and helped me pick and modify the perfect tattoo to resemble my trip. Mischa was extremely gentle considering it's on my shin, and even offered numbing cream. I've received a few messages since leaving checking on the healing of my tattoo. I plan on coming back to the same area just so that I can be tattooed again by Mischa.<//text><Resp>None< /Resp><Time>1612493395265< /Time>< user>

My tattoo artist was paul, he's an artist who's genuinely passionate about the art he produces. He puts thought and heart into what the does, he worked with me and was honest. He's a great artist I highly recommend you call and ask, I did and I got a great tattoo because of it.<//Text>

<text>I seriously can’t say enough about how awesome this shop is. From Mischa to JT to Shmitty, the energy they fill the shop with is 10/10. All of the artists do such great work as I’ve gotten tattoos done from multiple guys and they treat you with so much consideration and respect that it’s the only shop I go to now! Highly recommend!</text>< userid>

Go get tattooed by Mischa Matulich. Prices are more than fair, shop is super clean, very professional and family friendly. Work is second to none. Honestly, if you get a chance to get tattooed by the guy you should feel lucky. MISCHA MATULICH!<//Review>

<text>I've been to a few shops around San Diego, and while they were all very nice- I've found a home at Seven Seas. Everyone at the shop is fantastic. I've been working exclusively with Mischa for almost a year, and I feel so honored to have found him. Every time I come in with an idea, he creates something a thousand times better than what I had imagined in my mind. I do not trust easily, but its gotten to the point that I'll let Mischa tattoo whatever he thinks will work best, as he is a perfectionist that will take his time, and will always make you feel comfortable whenever you're in the shop. If you've never found "your artist" go see him. I probably won't ever let anyone else ever tattoo me.<//text>< gmapID>

<Text>Pretty cool spot downtown. Has an old school tattoo shop feel to it. Very clean and everyone is very professional. I’ve been going to Mischa for a while now. Dude does solid work and very versatile.  I can bring him a picture of what I want and he will draw up something that looks 100 times better than what I had imagined. Super glad that I found the right guy to do my tattoos<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Stopped in to check this place out and did not leave disappointed.  I've been to several great tattoo parlors in SD including Sailors Grave and Lucky's but these guys are right up there with them.  Came in with an idea and the artist helped me come up with a great design.  The shop was clean and the employees were very professional.  I look forward to going back and would recommend them to anyone looking for a high quality traditional tattoo!<//text>

<Text>100% hand painted flash decorates the walls in this tattoo shop. The artists there dedicate their time to improving their techniques and a real bond can be felt between the artists. The owner, Dan, is a greatly skilled tattooist, and will help you find the design and size to meet your budget in the best way< /Text>< Pics>

Worst Car Rental Experience ever!

Do not use this branch if you like to have a respectful service or be charged correctly

- the car in the picture was referred as ‘filthy’ from 5 steps away by the owner, charged us for cleaning fee

- owner of the place tell my husband without paraphrasing ‘your wife should behave better’ (!)

- when we said this cleaning fee was not legal and we do not authorize our card to be charged, he said us that ‘yeah go ahead and sue us, sue me’

Details: we rented for 10 days from airport branch, and as you see there was dust and only one place had a leafs.<//Review>

<review>Check in was fine but the car smelled terribly of smoke and of the last driver (or several?), and the surfaces all looked dirty. After wiping them, including the headrest, with paper towels they came off gray. In this time when we expect things to be kept clean and sanitary this is unacceptable.< /review><Name>Dan Carlin</Name>< pictures>

<username>Gabriel Nava</username><text>I went to rent a car here for work-related purposes. Today I was told by the lady at the counter she considered me "a high risk" (aka she didn't believe I worked at a certain tech place in the bay area) and she attempted to get me to physically surrender my work I.D. to them to verify the AWD I use. By company policy I am not allowed to surrender my ID even for physical inspection. She also kept asking me where I was going. There were other customers in the store. I have never felt so humiliated in my life. I keep asking myself, why single me out specifically? Was it for the way I dressed? My age? Race? I quite honestly felt discriminated as I have never had this happen at any other location. Avoid this place if possible!< /text><Response>{'time': 1594576332007, 'text': "Hello Gabriel!

The only thing shiftier than a rental car is this co-branded Avis/Budget franchisee. Arrived at the 7:30 am opening time to pick up the car I reserved online for $70/weekend. The printed contract stated $130. When asked about the discrepancy the owner said 'it's $60 for the extra 30 minutes beyond three days'.  Huh? By now it's 7:40 am. Turns out the following Monday is a holiday and they don't open until 8 am. Since I "can't return (the car) until 8 am, it's an extra $60 'late fee'".

OK-I'll wait 20 minutes, rent the car today at 8:00 am and thus stay within the three day window. "Too late," he quips, "the transaction is complete and your credit card's been charged!"  When I challenged his lack of a signed rental agreement he countered "all I can do now is void your existing reservation and book a new one" -at a substantially higher price. No thanks. As I walked out he magically gained the ability to credit my previously 'unchangeable' 7:30 am "transaction" $60-but only after I returned the car, and (naturally) with nothing confirmed in writing.

Righhhht.  Read the other reviews for how these shady undocumented future 'promises' have played out. I can only imagine the return damage inspection.

Walked across the street, hopped in a Gig-car, drove where I needed to go and conveniently "returned" it right in front of my own house. No slight-of-contract shenanigans, trumped-up damages or belligerent business owners necessary-and with the fuel included Gig turned out to be cheaper!

UPDATE:  Adding insult to injury, the response from "socialinfo@Avis" was just empty-Google-review-fixing.  Never heard a peep back.  Nice work, Avis.</text>

< review>
The only reason I've EVER rented from this Avis is because it's directly across the street from my coworking space.  It has, in my 10 rental experiences there, NEVER been a pleasant experience.  The Owner/Franchisee has uniformly been standoffish.  Not once do I remember him saying to me, "thank you for your business" or "how are you" or "have a good day."  Today I had an experience that broke the camel's back, and I will NEVER rent here again. I'd rather go to Enterprise even though it's a 5-minute walk extra.  It's just not worth it to interact with this owner, who cares ZERO about customer service or satisfaction.  My rental agreement said I "rented" it at 3:58pm.  Actually I didn't get in the car until at least 4:10pm.  I returned the car at 4:30pm the next day.  the owner said he will charge me $41 because I'm 3 minutes past the grace period of 29 minutes.  he said that's the rule and wouldn't budge.  That is pure nickel and diming when I'm someone who has rented at least 10 times before.  I don't know how much power AVIS has over franchisees, but if there's nothing that they will do, then I will NEVER rent from any Avis again.<//review>

<review>My dad had a heart attack and was kept in the hospital longer than anticipated. When I asked to extend the car rental so I could pick him up, the operator Amin refused to waive the extension fee. He said "Everyone has a heart attack, this is a business." When I said it's not in his business interest to treat customers this way, and he said "That's the kind of person I am." DO NOT rent a car here if you want to be treated like a human being.<//review>< pictures>

WORST rental car service EVER! Please DO NOT rent a car from this branch!

Their computers have some serious technical problems. You have to wait for the paperwork like forever, even though you are the only customer. The agents do not appeared apologetic for any technical problem at all. They are shockingly rude to customers. They unreasonably asked us to drive to another branch just for adding a driver. That's ridiculous. After waiting for 25 mins, we left, and they shouted at us, saying that it's not their fault, but the computers' fault. What a joke! The next day, my phone got a lot of advertisement phone calls and messages, which never happened before. I am pretty sure that the agent of this branch illegally leaked my personal information for revenge.<//Review>

If I cannot rent one then just tell me, don’t waste my time. Car selection was very limited. They only had about 10 cars available.

<Review>I have been renting from this location the last few years. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. Their rates are very reasonable. They don't have a big lot, but they have a fairly good selection of vehicle models.

<review>After two rental experiences at this branch, I can really say that the couple running this branch are extremely friendly and always seem to look out for me. The first time they gave us a free upgrade to a sports car (!!!), and the second time a car that included GPS (even though I said my boyfriend can navigate, she said this way he can relax :P). Even when I returned the rental five minutes before closing, they maintained a friendly attitude. I'll keep going back!< /review><Resp>{'time': 1507563440175, 'text': 'We are so happy to hear that you had a positive experience while renting with us, Eva Nichols.

< Review>
Great car rental place. I rented a Mustang cabriolet that they suggested. They showed me how the car worked and I had a legendary road trip down the Big Sur, before I delivered the car at the LAX. Very easy to deliver the car and taking their shuttle to the airport</Review>

<Text>I've been renting cars from this location for at least five years and I have always found the staff friendly and helpful. Only once did I get a car that had a mechanical issue, which I noticed when I was a few blocks away from the facility. I returned it and was given an upgrade in exchange. The rates are fair and sometimes significantly lower than their competitors.<//Text><Response>None</Response><userid>109113094752662938777< /userid>< Rate>

<Review>I was wary of using any rental agencies in US due to their infamous service reviews and mostly stuck with zipcar / getaround / gig / uber, but I needed a car for few weeks and gave them a shot and was pleasantly surprised! I only had to wait a minute in line, everything was processed in 5 minutes (I did reserve and pay for it in advance), did a check, got the keys, and was out in 10 minutes. The gentleman at the counter was professional and car is great. Will be back for future long rentals!<//Review>< Pics>

I rented a car twice at this location and my experience was excellent. The lady at the counter is really efficient and very quick when you have to just pick up the car after the online reservation. What I liked the most is the fact that she doesn't push you to buy extra services, and she gives you the right advices to enjoy the rent of your car (FasTrak, bridge crossing, etc..).</text>

<review>Run by a 50 year-old couple and very unprofessional. They told me could waive my young driver fee but forced me to buy full insurance which is the same charge as waive the insurance and pay young driver fee. Rate is pretty expensive compared with other rental companies. I walked in and ordered a small car and later told them to cancel it before I left because it's too expensive. But they still charged my credit card $91 without letting me know the total price first. Never used AVIS/Budget before and won't even try it in future anymore.<//review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1503273071891, 'text': "We're very sorry to hear this, Andy Zhang.

Pickup was fine, despite a little wait. Gas tank was on 7/8 but they marked it as full- beware of this trick! Car interior was dirty but didn’t smell horribly. Dropoff was incredibly annoying because the man who met us outside claimed we didn’t fill up the gas tank the whole way (we filled until it clicked.) The gauge appeared close to 7/8, but the guy insisted we fill it up. He referred us to a cash only station, but we found another one close by that was more reputable. We put .9 gallons past the “full” clicking sounds forcing it into the tank, which was supposedly 1/8 of a tank!? I think something is wrong with that gas gauge, but he wouldn’t listen to our warning. I am warning customers- go to the location on Gillman in North Berkeley instead!!!</text>

<text>Worst customer service ever. Was assured we would have a car through Avis’s national service, but when we showed up, no car. They even went so far as to suggest that the customer service rep from the national company had lied to us. Never use this location!< /text>< username>

< review>
Very rude, blunt, unprofessional. I visited the branch 2 weeks in advance of my week-long trip and asked if debit is accepted. The employee (female in 40s) said "yes" almost instantly. So I made an online reservation for car rental and came back to the branch 2 weeks later. Then the same person said "If you don't have SSN you wouldn't pass the credit check". And it didn't. So I asked her why you had told me a different thing before. She didn't seem to listen at all and just repeated the same thing over and over "you didn't pass the credit check". Wow! She said to call AVIS and cancel immediately so I don't get charged w/ cancellation fee. LOL the credit check thing is against my will. She should've called AVIS herself and taken care of. Isn't that what the employee is paid for?Anyway I went to a different rental place in Berkeley and they were such nice and polite people. LUCKY I couldn't rent at AVIS cuz I definitely believe she would've ripped me off if I rented here !!<//review>

(Translated by Google) The worst car rental site. I have gone twice, the first to ask for information and the second to pick up a car that I had booked by phone. Both times the clerk an edge and a rude. The first time he didn't want to give me information and in bad ways he sent me a phone call. Call, make the reservation without problem and when I arrived on the same day I was traveling to pick up the car the same man tells me in bad ways that for being 24 years old and not 25 I needed a credit card and not a debit card, which I had not been told when making the reservation. Not only did I run out of a car and I cannot travel losing the money from the hotels, but the man instead of apologizing spoke to me in a bad way and told me that if he had any problem he would call and claim. The funny thing is that I made the reservation at AVIS because I had a free two-day coupon for having had another similar problem for a year. Not change. The worst place to rent cars, the worst company.

(Original)
El peor sitio de alquiler de coches. He ido dos veces, la primera para pedir informacion y la segunda para recoger un coche que habia reservado por telefono. Las dos veces el dependiente un borde y un maleducado. La primera vez no me quiso dar informacion y de malas maneras me mando llamar por telefono. Llame, realice la reserva sin problema y al llegar el mismo dia que me iba de viaje a recoger el coche me dice el mismo señor de malas maneras que por tener 24 años y no 25 necesitaba una tarjeta de credito y no de debito, cosa que no me habian dicho al realizar la reserva. No solo me quede sin coche y no puede viajar perdiendo asi el dinero de los hoteles, sino que el señor en vez de disculparse me hablo de mala manera y me dijo que si tenia algun problema llamara por telefono y reclamara. Lo mas gracioso es que hice la reserva en AVIS porque tenia un cupon de dos dias gratis por haber tenido otro problema parecido hacia un año. No cambian. El peor sitio para alquilar coches, la peor empresa.< /review>

In all the years that I have visited the services of Dr. Michael Blum after each case requiring relief from joint pains or just plain bone realignment I must admit that his expertise with his profession is remarkable to say the least and that he deserve my complete confidence!</Review>

Very inviting and clean practice, staff is really friendly and informative. Never a long wait. What really got me was Dr Blum's ability to diagnose and treat my back problems. They took ex-rays and showed me how my spine and hips had become out of alignment and told me the process he would take to fix get me straight again.</text>

Dr. Mike Blum Is always accommodating for appointments. I always call when I really need to see him and pretty much get in the same day. If you were ever in pain, have headache or stiffness in your body I highly recommend Dr. Mike Blum. I believe God put healers on this earth and I feel like he is definitely one of them.! He is always kind, compassionate and cares. Don’t hesitate! Book an appointment! Oh and the girls working in the front are awesome too!< /review>

<Text>Dr. Mike (Dr. Michael Blum) is a gift from God. I am so grateful to him for giving me my life back. Without him I would not be able to walk or have any resemblance to a normal life. He genuinely cares about you and your well-being, and he works hard with you by doing all he can to help bring you back to good health. He is gentle and strong and kind. His very essence is that of a good man who wants to heal people. I'm so thankful for his wonderful healing work that it is hard to put into words. Once I found him, I stayed, and it's been years! Even Rosie who works in the business section is the kindest lady and I adore her as well as Dr. Mike. Dr. Mike is the best of the best, the cream of the crop, and there's no one else like him anywhere. God bless this man and all he does to help others.<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>Two days ago,  the sciatic nerve pain in my right leg was so bad I couldn’t walk.  I stood and my leg collapsed under me.  I called All Ages Chiropractic in Toluca Lake, and they told me to come in immediately.  I was screaming in the car the whole way there, I was in so much pain.  But Dr Michael Blum quickly figured out what was wrong.  Popped my right hip back into proper alignment, reducing the nerve pain in seconds, and took me through a series of exercises to regain mobility.

I walked out slowly, feeling much better. Went back for a second adjustment yesterday, and then left the office and took a two mile walk!!  ‘Y wife was shocked at how quickly I was healing.

When I was ready for bed last night my hip was still slightly off, but all the sciatic pain was gone!  It was miraculous.  I felt so much better.  The healing continued  today and I should be back to full mobility by the weekend.

I am so thankful to Dr Blum and the whole team at All Ages Chiropractic!  My wife loved using one of the massage chairs in the waiting room while I went in for my treatments. And the staff could be nicer.

Also, Dr Mike is super laid back and personable, and everyone there makes you feel so welcome and cared for.  With the fun 80s pop-rock playing In the offices, and Dr Mike’s reassuring expertise, I also feel safe and relaxed, knowing he’ll quickly relieve my pain, and get me back to 100% without drugs. And it’s super reasonably priced, with plans to fit any budget.

Thanks again!!  I don’t know what I’d do without you!!</text>< pics>

I've been to many chiropractors in the past, this one is something special. I was recommended to this chiropractor by my yoga teacher, he said he's been coming here for a long time and he had other students that were here as well. A facility is very comfy and there are massage chairs in the waiting room, the restroom is clean and the staff is very helpful and friendly. although I'm not done with my treatment yet I have a feeling that down the road I am going to be getting a lot better and faster.

It seems like doctor Blum as many ways of approaching certain issues, he is very experienced and makes sure to give you a feeling that you are on the right track.

Also, I very like the fact that they tell you that you could stay in the treatment room where the ice packs as long as you would like just to give you a good feeling and make sure that you are in control of your recovery.</Review>

I’ve been going to Dr. Mike for a few years now, and he and his staff are great. He’s knowledgeable about what exercises can help with back and neck pain, he gives a great adjustment, and he has been encouraging when I dealt with a herniated disc that he’s been helping me to deal with. The front desk staff is great too- they are always friendly and are able to schedule my appointments when they work for me.<//Text>

< Review>
I know this is going to come off as hokey  or insincere  but
Dr Blum is the only one I have found who can control and relieve my
pain. I have tried many other things, acupuncture, shots and the only relief
to my pain  has been from Dr. Blum. I have a  nerve problem in my back
which generates down my leg. I am very fortunate ( after much frustration )
to have found All Ages.<//Review>

<Text>Dr. Blum is currently adjusting me for two months and I have to say I look forward to every appointment. He's easy going and always makes me feel welcome and under great care. He's so wonderful.

His staff is equally as awesome. The girls are always so sweet and greet everyone by name and ask if you'd like a few things before getting comfortable. Totally professional on every end. Im so happy I found this place and will remain my chiropractor.

PS. I never write reviews but they deserve it.</Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<text>BEWARE!!!

I rarely leave negative reviews, but my experience with the whole staff including Dr. Blum was not pleasant.

I went to my first appointment and it took me an hour before I actually got any treatment. In total, I was at the office for 1.5 hours and the treatment only took 10 minutes. A minute for the adjustment and 5 or so minutes laying down with a cold pack. (Which they charge for btw)

My biggest complaint is that they charged my first appointment $500!!!!
I found another chiropractor that told me that that fee was ridiculous and they overpriced me for the appointment. They charged me $250 for the examination which consist of Dr. Blum touching my back for a minute. They charged me another $100 for the X-Rays. $125 for the adjustment. They charged me $15 for laying down on a couple cold packs after the adjustment. Then they let me keep the cold pack. They made it seem like the cold pack was going to be for free, but they end up charging me $10 to keep the cold pack.

I left the office feeling like I did not get a proper treatment.

This practice is not upfront about their fees until after they've already provided you the services.

When I tried to get a copy of the paperwork I signed, it took them days before they sent it over to me. I tried to get a copy of my X-Rays and that also took a while to get.

Everyone has their own experience with Dr. Blum, unfortunately mine was the worst.<//text>< Pics>

Dr. Blum is absolutely amazing!
I have played many competitive sports over the years, and have suffered many injuries.
Every day I use to wake up stiff and sore, and it would take hours for me to get moving somewhat normal.
Since seeing Dr. Blum and continuing with regular Chiropractic visits I am pain free and wake up ready to go in the morning. It has been several years now.
Dr. Blum has a very effective style of adjusting, and has helped me with the foods I eat and the nutrition I take. Even though it's a long drive for me it's worth it!

Thank Doc!!< /text>

<review>Very friendly and they saw me within an hour of my calling. I was in so much pain. They have a payment plan if you don’t have insurance.  They do Xrays on the spot< /review>< Response>

I applied for a loan to set up the office but realized that my credit score was a mere 580 which wasn’t sufficient enough for getting the best loan at a low interest rate. This was a setback for my dream so I researched online for a good credit repair service.

Finally, after deciding between 2 different companies I contacted Park View Credit for a consultation. Their representative, Michael, guided me through the entire process. He checked and reviewed my credit report to spot items contributing to the low score. While working on the credit repair process, he never failed to keep me informed about how things were progressing which was a big plus. Improvements were seen after about 2 months after enrolling. They got some major negative items removed  I was on top of the world to see MY (yes my very own credit score) at 670! Big thanks to the entire team at Park View Credit. You guys are the best. Keep up the good work!!!< /Review>< Gmap_id>

< review>
I have to admit that I went into this hopeful. trying to buy a home for my family, so anybody else needed to save as much money as possible while also trying to fix my credit so that I could purchase a home.
When talking to them everything sounded so good, so I agreed. The initial payment was steep I thought but really wanted my credit fixed. As soon as I said yes is the moment I should have assumed the position. They are all liars, cheats, and frauds. Nothing professional about this firm. Their Boilerplate excuses got old. 6 months, over $1,000.00 and nothing they did has improved. such a fraud that they ( check you portal if you have used them) even dispute your positive items on you credit. What a Joke. They will not give a refund, they have found a way to steal money from people. Anybody can write the same letters they are writing with a little time and research..  reading other reviews - please notice that they are either wonderful or crappy more crappy so don't be fooled by the ( I assume they are paid ) reviews that hype this company up, common sense would indicate that if they could get results, then they would get results and the reviews wouldn't be great vs. scam. personal experience proves the scam side. So enter at you own risk.  (PS I wouldn't have rated 1 star except they make you to post )</review>

I called every single credit repair company on the top ten lists and I had the best experience with Park View. My credit was fixed in a timely manner, with a personal case manager working with me throughout the duration of my case. I called him a few times every week and he would talk me through my progress, and I felt in the loop the whole time. I would recommend Park View to anyone, the staff are very friendly and the service they provide is invaluable.<//review>< pictures>

Park View Credit was instrumental in helping me qualify for a mortgage. In 4 months they cleared almost all of my old bad credit and instructed me on what to do to build better credit. My credit score has gone up over 150 points and I am now pre qualified for my mortgage and able to put in offers on a house. 4 months ago, I never thought I'd be this far along. I highly recommend this company to anyone who needs help improving their credit!</review>

Well I was shocked by the 89.99 a month but that's just because I forgot about it,60 days is a long time.  Just about everything negative is off my credit. I will likely be canceling soon due to a job well done by park view because I am back in control of my own credit. I have recommended to my husband and to any friends who have asked.<//Text>

<Text>Please keep your money and stay far way. The worst customer service. They are rude and argue instead of clearing any doubts or concerns regarding the lack of communication and unprofessionalism. Every time I tried to explain my situation, the customer service Agent felt the need to talk over or interrupt me without letting me complete my sentence.

It was frustrating and annoying having to deal with an agent that would not listen to a customer's concern.

If she would of made me feel comfortable with the process, I've would of continue paying the 89.99 per month for how many months? No one could really give me an approximate timeline on how long they would drag this process. I had 4 trade line that were only 30 late errors and 1 collection/surcharge off that was satisfied. I could of of technically got these trade line removed through app like Credit Karma. But was sold on fake promises. Truly not worth the hassle of dealing with attitude when someone is easily changing you for a service they have failed to delivered.

1 trade line removed, over $400 in fees paid. Not what I was promised or sold on.

*****and please, don't send me your dummy reply....  "Customer satisfaction is our #1priority.....

Waste of money and time.  The person I spoke with said at PVC and they told me they removed three items.  One of those items was a duplicate another of the items I had received correspondence from the credit reporting agency that said they made a mistake when they put it on my credit report.  The third one I just received a letter from the credit card company that they made a mistake in removing the item and are putting it back on.  I have received numerous pieces of mail from the companies I am in debt with and each letter I receive references my dispute.  The letters basically say that after their investigation there is no fraud or verification that I have no grounds to dispute.  Not too sure if PVC is writing letters claiming that the items on my reports are fraud???  Tried to call today to see if I could get a partial refund or something and the response was no.  I will never recommend to anyone to use this company.< /review>< Pics>

<text>** I will be filling with the BBB today. Wish I would have checked there first! You need to check that asap! ***If I could give them 0 stars I would. Please, please spend your money elsewhere. I am ashamed I let myself get sucked into this scheme.  Moral of the story, read the fine print, and memorize the contract like it's your bible. Because they will screw you. I paid over 2000 dollars for nothing. NOTHING. Seriously, heed my warning, I should have read the reviews first they speak volumes.<//text>< pictures>

Excellent Service. These guys are your one stop solution to Credit Problems.

What I liked about them
1. I had to meet their Lawyer once on the phone and he understood my problems very well
2. After that when ever I dropped an email to Support, these guys called me back on the same day
3. The Support guys/gals are very knowledgeable and give the right advice.

I will recommend their services to any one and I will definitely go back to them in future if I have any other problem with Credit.</Text>

This service DOES work!  Jeff was very nice and knowledgable about my situation.  They have gotten a number of things removed from my credit ,and my score has gone up around 80 points in just a few months with hopefully more to come.  I will finally be able to get a home loan and put my past in the past- thank you Jeff!< /review>

<Review>The entire experience was easy!  From the first friendly phone call that got me signed up to the final friendly phone call when I resigned, everything was a cinch!  Park View worked quickly to start cleaning up my credit.  I went from 610 to 680 in a couple of months and I am now purchasing my first home, and I was ok'd for a loan that is enabling me to get my dream home!  I would recommend this to anyone struggling with their credit.  I had old bills that I had paid off but they were still coming up on my report.  Not anymore!!  Thank you Park View Credit!!< /Review>< pics>

Do yourself a favor don't trust this company  they will tell you everything positive that you want to hear like your credit will be fixed in 6 months or less your credit score will start improving after first 3 month of service with them it been almost 2 years i have been paying them $89.99 and when i talk to a rep almost couple months ago he said sir there is no guarantee that your score get better in 3 months some times it take years and i when i told him so you guys lie to me and kept me in bubble that every you guys will fix my credit his reply was you can think what ever you want sir. lately i've been emailing them so many times that i keep getting a letter from collection agency for 3 months they said ignore it and today i just saw my score went down 35 points  cause of that collection agency and i have been calling them emailing them leaving them messages and guess what no reply back. SO IF YOU HAVE EXTRA MONEY TO BLOW START PAYING MINIMUM ON YOUR PAYMENTS, HIRE A DIFFERENT CREDIT REPAIR COMPANY OR JUST GO TO STRIP CLUB TO BLOW THAT MONEY.</text>

Would steer away from this. They say it is a free consultation yet I was charged $59.95 for this consultation. I chose not to develop a personalized strategy. I cancelled before I even started, on day one, and yet was charged and am arguing with them for a refund. I was told by the representative that it cost $59.95 for them to pull my credit and hand it over to a legal representative. I received ZERO services, what part of this is free?<//text>

< Review>
I have used Park View for the last year or so and they have taken care of all the discrepancies on my credit profile. I appreciate everything that they were able to accomplish and would use them again if I ever have another issue involving a matter such as this.<//Review>

Was trying to purchase a home and needed to improve credit score. Had been through forecloser and bankruptcy. They got my score over 700 and I was able to purchase home. Was a bit skeptical at times they don't contact or update you to much but they did the job.</text>

<review>This place is a total SCAM!!! I'm sure the positive reviews are from paid actors. All Park View Legal does is take your money. I requested my full refund and I was denied. I show no improvement in my credit. I was charged $59.95 to have have them check my credit then had a consultant tell me I had to pay $600 upfront to fix my credit with no further charges after that. After I believed them and paid the $600, they started charging me $89.99 a month! They put me in a financial crisis. I'm a single mother of 3 (all under the age of 10) and couldn't afford my living expenses after I was charged. I'm sure they're happy to know they put me and my family on the streets. Luckily, I have my family helping me out but I lost so much money because of them. I lost almost $750 that could have gone to my bills and children. I was guaranteed my money back but after I called numerous times and emailing them, all they did for me was take my money, make me lose everything I've worked so hard for, and cancel my account with them. Everyone, just go to Lexington Law cuz they work with you, not take your money.      ~Tanya Chaidez</review>< rating>

A half dozen times, through 2 conversations, I was told there was a no questions asked money back gauruntee. These slime bags are liars. I wouldn't trust them!

<Review>In 2015 I  was looking to buy a home but when my husband pasted away in 2010 I lost my home and so I had a foreclosure on my credit and a few credit card collection caused also by the death of my husband, my credit was pretty rough and I was referred to Parkview legal, I was a bit skeptical but really had nothing to loose, this was September 29, 2015 and today (12/24/15) I called and cancel my service  because they were able to get the foreclosure off of all 3 credit bureaus as well as remove 3 bad credit cards. One bureau is at 777, 769 and a stubborn Experian is at 634 cause they wouldn't cave but in March those will fall off and it will be at 780, that's the only  reason I did give them 5 stars. If you have the money go ahead.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

If I could give Park View Credit 0 stars, I would. They cheated me out of $450.00 and have wasted several months of my time. At first they we're very friendly and full of promises but once they got my money they forgot about me. I've called & emailed them several times and they keep giving me the run around and making excuses. They haven't done anything and they refuse to give me my money back. I'm going to the BBB & California state Attorney next, I'm sure that will get their attention.</review>

<Review>I retract my 2 stars to a 1.. if that... these people are lazy in their results. I had 2 accounts supposedly in delinquency from 2015 and these people haven't caught it .i called this account myself and it was paid in full in June 2015 and transunion said they would delete it. Making parkview credit "repair" look pretty foolish. They took 150.00 away from me and won't refund it.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Started services with this company 6 months ago per the contract if they dont improve the credit score you can get a full refund! Well thats a lie!!! Talk with peter who stated he was a manager and stated Im not getting my money back!! Next step is the better business bureau... Stay away from this businesses as they will charge you 89.00 a month for not doing anything and will keep taking the money out for no work done!!!!</review>

<review>Don't do business with them. They took many off my card before I could talk to somebody. And when I called to ask for a refund they took forever to do it. It seemed like they didn't want to do it at all. But they put my money back on my card then they following day they took it right back off my card after I told them that I do not want to do business with them.

Do not trust this company. These people will scam you right out of the gate. They will say its a one time fee then hit you monthly. I have a portal with all 3 credit company's. There has not been one dispute sent in the 5 months i have been with parkveiw. They said they sent the letters they don't even send letters guys online you can do a little research and print off your own disputes or pay at one of the credit B for credit protection and that will including in disputing all of your history including inquires. its like 35 dollars for 6 months its cheap. I just got off the phone and the rep said cancel we have pleanty of people to take there money and hung up. Guys i am not just an unhappy customer, i dont want anyone else to get taking for the kind of money i was. I am sure they will take this down. Dont do it you will loose your money.<//Review>

The monies they charged for a no service or communication job does not worth it. They are liers, thieves and obnoxious people.
They called me onces since they took my monies plus excessive amount I did not agree to. They showed no interest in my credit report issues. Called once only to say they did not get a paymenty. When I called the bank, they had already took the monies. I have not heasrd from them since. My bank account just keep getting deductions.
I am charging it back, they are thieves. Dont give a dam about me and my credit issues</text>

I William G. Voigt would not recommend anyone for Parkview Credit to repair your credit. I have been dealing with them since November 2016, and have spent $1300.00 Dollars and they have done nothing to help repair my credit. Its sad when you confine in a company and tust they will help you do so and it never happened. I just if your looking for Credit repair seek else where.

This place is such a SCAM! DO NOT USE THEM AT ALL! I WOULD GIVE IT ZERO STARS BUT IT MAKES YOU ATLEAST CHOOSE 1. 59.95 FOR NOTHING AT ALL WHEN THEY SAY IT COUNTS FOR WHAT YOUR REPAIR WOULD COST. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE. I AM PISSED! I NORMALLY DON'T WRITE REVIEWS BUT THIS IS A JOKE! WHEN I DIDN'T PROCEED WITH THE REPAIR STRATEGY AFTER BEING TOLD I WAS IN CONTROL OF MY PAYEMENT PLAN WETHER ID WANT TO PAY $5.00 a month or $20.00 a Month I'd be in control hence the reason I put the 59.95 to have an anaylst call me to set up my payement plan and review my credit with me. VERY MISLEADING! When the anaylyst called and reviewed my credit all sounded promising then he tells me his computer would only allow 199 a month! I cant afford this. AND THE 59.95 the guy pretty much said Id lose if I didnt proceed which could be going to feed my 18month old daughter! I will be reporting this to the BBB and other agencies! They Are a SCAM!</Review>

This place sucks they charge you and initial fee then a monthly fee I didn't see any improvement at all. This place sucks. I wish they would just give me my money back but as the crappy company they are it's likely not happening I am going to file a complaint with bbb.<//review>

This service really does work. After not being able to get approved for a credit card, I decided to get help.  After looking around at different company reviews I decided to go with Park View Legal. I did a lot of research and they were the only company I could find with a guarantee. It only took six months and not only was I approved for a credit card, but I was also able to finance a car!</Text>

<review>This place is a gold mine! I just moved into the neighborhood a month ago and I was looking for a good staple grocery store. Lo and behold the Grocery Outlet on Santa Clara street. The prices are decently affordable, especially when compared to the expensive chains like Safeway or a Trader Joe's.

Another great thing is really helpful staff!

They offer everything from household stuff to some limited decor to food. Easy for a quick drop in for dish soap or cleaning supplies, body stuff or even a fluffy blanket.

Moving onto fresh food: I have a very broad palette too and love to experiment with different foods and this place has a good variety in fruits, veggies, frozen selections, oils and junk. Although it's hard to find more niche stuff like plant spices (thyme, rosemary etc.), I give this place a solid 5/5.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

I love grocery outlet if they see there's more than a few people in mind they open another line to help you get out faster they keep the place clean tidy very nice people that work there very helpful I mean that's the only place I go to shop food wise treats candy whatever I like that place I highly recommend it everything is way cheaper than anywhere else I prefer to shop there I get more for my money but the people make it all that much better so it's a good place trust me you'll enjoy it and they don't leave you standing around they see them more than three or four people in line they bust out to open another cash register right away so it's a good place<//Review>

This is the outlet store and my high rating is based on this. You can buy fruits and vegetables for pretty low prices, also watch the deals - it could be very profitable. Some goods can be available one day and disappear another day. There are people asking for a change outside, just be aware.</text>

I'm a low spender in terms of groceries and I would love deals in groceries generally. This shop has almost every grocery at bargain price. Check once regarding items expiry as at times, it may expire in one or two months. Great shop to buy a verity of things.< /review>

<review>They are awful. I parked my car and later on discovered that it was towed, had to pay 430 for that. They don’t put any CLEAR signs saying that the parking lot is only for their customers. First of all, the parking lot is huge, and that area  has many stores, so it is not obvious. If you go to wholefoods, they put big signs saying parking limited for 2 hours, well this low level grocery store didn’t, which makes me think if someone else is profiting from the towing business. Weird that the manager had the towing phone number memorized, but never cared about putting signs about towing. What a shame. Taking money away from students...</review>< pics>

If you like wow prices. Take your time you will find unheard of prices on certain items . So I may not have thought about that item but if it's a box for 9 or more in other stores and I see 87 cents I have nothing to lose so I buy it up< /text>

I love this place. Being situated in the heart of downtown they have longer hours and, quite often a better selection than their sister sites. Being an outlet products vary continuously so regular visits yield different results. Beer selection is top shelf micro brew.< /Text>

It is a mix of discounted groceries and some dollar store type items. There is a bit of everything from wine to cereal to produce. They did have some great deals on organic items that I buy elsewhere.< /Review>

Oh did I mention all the healthy options in their NOSH aisle as well as my favorite the 20z 22grain and seed Oroweat Org bread it's fabulous.

Love the produce and range of goods, and neighborly feel of the place and good workers, but there is nothing that harshes my middle class mellow or the shopping vibe like having your carts sieze up at the door. Get RID of those things or get rid of good customers!! UGH!  You are telling us your management imagines all your customers to be thieves.  UGH. from 5 stars to one for that alone.<//review>

If you go with a more flexible list, you will do well. The costs tend to offset for me the need to usually still go to a second store for what I may not find here.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>I used to shop at Grocery Outlet a few times a week for the past 5 years. NEVER AGAIN. Other grocery outlet locations always told me to disregard the one hour parking sign and just enjoy shopping, and so why is the parking policy not consistent? This store does not offer restroom so I had to look elsewhere. Am I supposed to drive to look for a bathroom?! The store owner said its a franchise and every store operates independently, but such basic common sense and consistency are not here. It was during a slow hour and empty lot. They towed my car for pure greed after I shopped and went out to look for a bathroom. It cost $400 to get car back and they claim themselves a discount store? BOTCOTT FOREVER.< /Text>< Pictures>

Great bargain on food is no joke! Most of the time I find all of the food items I am looking for. However, CHECK EXPIRATION Date on all products before you get them (some tend to be expired or near expiration). Thats the reason I am taking a star off</review>

Excellent deals but check the expiration dates. I also was told that their "Wow" deals received via email are only for the day the email was received??? That was news to me as it said "while supplies last" HMMM. Can't complain when something is so cheap, so yeah, I'll continue to visit every couple of days.<//review>

This place changed from nice to bad. People wise. There was one gal in particular. I went this morning to return a few things I was going to cook for my son because we had to decided to eat out instead and she demanded to know why I was returning my items. Yes I had the receipt. The manager was there and she was polite but the gal at the register was rude. I felt humiliated. Like just because I am older she gets to abuse me. I am going back Monday and talking to the nice manager again. This type of behavior is unacceptable. Now they are under new management. It's improved some.<//review>

<text>This is the worst grocery outlet in the bay area, very rude customer service, and a totally ripoff store owner. You get better price and better selections at other grocery outlets. Also you always see a bunch of homeless beggars outside the store. Also beware that even if you shop at this store they still tow your car sometimes because they contract with a towing company nearby purely for greed, as they tow your car even when their big parking lot is virtually empty if you park over an hour. Totally unreasonable and rip off. Also beware that they sell expired food sometimes, mixed on their shelves. Consumer bureau complaint filed.</text>< GmapID>

I enjoy shopping at Grocery Outlet. I feel it is more beneficial for consumers that buy in bulk. You can't beat the price for pet food, either. The clerks there are courteous and quick, knowledgeable and accurate in locating items. They also have a large selection of hygiene, makeup, cookware, first aid,and household items.</review>

A grocery Outlet you always need to be careful. a lot of the products are almost at their shelf limit... I like it because they have merchandise like bath & electronics just variety of things that changes all year long a discount price. But the frozen food is good and cheap and this is blonde cashier that's really cute.,.....< /text>

Good deals for name brand items. The only problem is they rarely have the same deal twice. Buy it while you can or it will not be there the next time you visit.(If this review was helpful, please hit the "like" icon below)</Review>

I love this place because every time I go it is a shopping adventure.  The have everything from organic products, a wide assortment of everyday staples and IPA beer. They even have kitchen items. I bought two very nice Pyrex glass containers for $3.99 each. Their stock of items change often. If you see something you like at a good price, stock up because it may  be all gone tomorrow!</Review>

<text>I love the Grocery Outlet for discovering new products. Everything is so inexpensive that you can try so many new things and if it doesn't work out, very little loss.  It's not a place to get something you need all the time as products change daily. Think of it as a little adventure.</text>< pictures>

I have been a customer of this outlet many times. Many times I would park here and eat first and then buy groceries as there are so many neighboring restaurants. And one time I parked my car and they were watching me. They had my car towed because it took me more than one hour. The towing fees was $420 which was hole in the pocket. It would be better off to just park on street where rates are low and parking ticket is $60 but little did I know. It was 7pm winter night and lot was almost empty.

I am never going back to this outlet again. Towing fees extortion is an alternate business for this kind of grocery stores.</Review>

I was in a hurry to buy a charger and get through the brutal commute traffic.So I went in there to buy a car charger for my phone and a snack for the road.(never got any snacks! lol )So I got a charger that said it was compatible for my phone. When I got to the cashier, she insured me it would work and that I could bring it back if it didn't. I just needed it to work! After I purchased it I had immediately went to try and use it.  Smh nope didn't work and had to get a refund. Oh well.... cashier was nice but didn't know her stuff.The store had old model chargers. Who does that they are obsolete! Anyway had to go across the street to the Metro store to buy one you can read my review there. Overall this is a grocery store that has miscellaneous stuff. It was clean and maybe next time I would shop for groceries.</text>

< Review>
It's rare to find a carry basket when I walk in the door.  Unbelievable amount of products on the shelves with NO prices listed.  Trying to get a price check near the back of the store is very difficult.  Sometimes the store employee doesn't speak English or doesn't understand what I am asking for.  I needed $40 cash back, which is generally allowed, but I could only get $20.  Nowhere was the cash back restriction posted.  These comments are for the downtown San Jose store on Santa Clara street.< /Review>

Pros: Great place to get cheap and affordable groceries. Always check the dates on things. The reason things are cheaper is that items usually do not have a very long expiration date.

Cons: The cashout lines are very long because there are usually only two registers open. If you are looking for the same items on a weekly basis do not bother, not everything is stocked consistently. The checking of IDs for alcoholic beverages is questionable. According to what I've seen is that I have been born in many different years on multiple occasions.

All in all it is a decent place close by in the SJ downtown to grab some affordable groceries without having to break the bank.< /text>

Products are spoiling or spoiled due to transportation and storage. Products are priced incorrectly. The parking lot smells like urine and garbage. They don't always have everything I went there for causing for more spending in the long run. They don't have enough vegan products. Their water gallons aren't ever refrigerated. They would want to have more cashiers. Their plants are dying every time I walk in creating a poor front display. Their avacodas are usually too hard to eat right away. I brought a Naked almond milk beverage and got sick. I have no choice but to go to this store. Any where else I go the employees are rude and follow me because I wear a mask for allergies and backpack for my belongings. They employees here are really nice and helpful even though sometimes  feel like they're talking about me because I'm homeless.

<Review>I visit this location often; it is close to San José State and the Dr. MLK, Jr. Library. Good selection - check the expiration dates! Friendly staff, for the most part, too. This is my go-to source to test out new products for less. Especially items that are also sold at Whole Foods, or as my friend calls it "Whole Paycheck."</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I love grocery outlet!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They have awesome deals and you can buy in bulk which I love the most cuz I'm a mommy of two and live in a house full of eight so yeah!! The only thing I wish they had was more of a selection for household necessities. They have some and it's great it's a wonderful bargain it's just I wish they had more of a selection. And I wish they had more locations but I'm giving it a five stars because theyre deals are awesome and I've been going there since I was a kid so I have to say I love it love it love it<//text>

Prices are reasonable although quality is somewhat lacking on some items and selection is not huge. Items carried poo be week may not be there the next. Overall worth a visit.<//Text>

MELISSA (THE MANAGER) IS EXTREMELY RUDE!!!!! LACKS CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS!!!! DAMN LADY, I WAS JUST MAKING A QUICK STOP FOR SOME SNACKS LOL...

SHE YELLED AT ME FROM THE CASHIER (WHEN I WAS, LIKE, 10 FT FROM HER) IN FRONT OF OTHER CUSTOMERS!!! JUST BECAUSE I LEFT MY BIKE INSIDE THE STORE AFTER AN EMPLOYEE TOLD ME IT WAS OK. (MY LOCK GOT BUSTED EARLIER DURING THE DAY SO I DIDN'T WANT IT TO GET STOLEN).
THE EMPLOYEES APOLOGIZED FOR HER!!!

...OTHER THAN THAT, I LOVE LOVE GROCERY OUTLET 'CUS OF THE LOW PRICES AND GUESS WHAT?! I STILL GOT MY SNACK ON!! ...AND NEXT TIME IMA GO AND LEAVE MY BIKE INSIDE AGAIN BUT YOU COME UP TO ME AND YELL IN MY FACE OK? LOL💘< /Text>

They have a good size organic section for 40-50% off regular prices.
Cheese, dips and toiletries are super cheap. It will ruin you for regular grocer stores!< /text>

Prices are very competitive. They don't carry everything that the major chain stores have, but what they do carry, is at a significant discount. When I go grocery shopping I take my list here first, then I'll get the few remaining items at the more expensive chain stores.</Text>

<name>Sara Grevera<//name><time>1502823382416< /time><rate>5<//rate><Text>The cheapest prices you will find for groceries almost guaranteed!  The protein/supplement section is a hidden gem.  You can get protein powders at almost half the price than what you would find elsewhere.  Granted, it is pretty random on what brands they sell week to week, but if you are not brand picky, then this is fantastic!  The other day I was there, I found Buff Bake protein cookies for 50c/each, which is a complete steal since those cookies normally go for $2.99/each.  And the cookies did not taste stale or old at all!  I normally shop here for non refrigerated/frozen items because I am pretty leery of those types of products here due to the expiration dates.

If are you looking to make your dollar go far, look no further than Grocery Outlet.<//Text>< Pictures>

A moderately-sized store of a well organized and reasonably comprehensive inventory, comprising food (with a few pre-mixed salads etal), sundries (matts, storage containers, kitchen items, etal), and health items (vitamins, supplements, non-prescription meds, etal).

Low prices are the real selling point! I don't need to go to the local CostCo anymore for select staples.

Manned (only) checkout counters are always understaffed, but acceptably courteous. On the infrequent necessity to ask for aisle info for a food item, staff are always knowledgeable, but just try to find one at liberty to ask!< /review>

I love this place because you can buy all kinds of organic stuff for cheap, but of course the stock is inconsistent so you can't count on it being there if you come back for it. Also... They can only sell booze from 10-9 so if you come outside those hours you can't buy any. Something about the elementary school across the street. :/<//review>

Don't expect the place to be clean or well staffed. Be careful that the food you sepect is good (a lot of almost bad fruit and veggies. But the prices are great.</review>

My shopping experiences at the Oroville Grocery Outlet have been great! I'm not just referring to the low prices of so many of their products, but what really enhances this store in Oroville is their friendly service. Many of the employees will even recommend specific products on sale when I am in the store.<//Text>

The prices are good, but you should check the expiry dates of products before you buy. It could be so close.<//Text>

<text>Prices are good as a person can find now days. Of course,  they once in in awhile run low on certain brands, because they are so busy , and keeping the place organization as well as they are kind to you when your shopping, or need help finding things, even fellow customer s are awesome.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Great prices definitely. But you need to check the expiry date . Most of the time they are close by and that is the reason it would be so cheap .< /Review>

Best thing about this place is the offering of limited, seasonal beverages (i.e. Hint Fizz, La Croix, San Pellegrino, etc.) For outrageous prices. You end up saving!< /text>

I do not recommend them they call wing crane to tow your car so if you want to buy something in the same parking lot as eating a soup you have to park at the restaurant if this shop does not take a picture of your vehicle and gives it to you if you you spend an hour is stupid because it is the same place to park for all business and you will have to pay 420 dollars really the managers give very bad service<//Review>

(Translated by Google) This store sells very cheap I had not discovered it until a friend told me and I went and the truth compared prices and if I realized that I saved too much and that is why I loved going to that store, recommended for now that the holidays are coming to save as much as possible ahitita that money is scarce.

(Original)
Esta tienda vende muy barato No lo había descubierto hasta que me dijo un amigo y fui y la verdad compare precios y si me di cuenta que me ahorre demasiado y por eso me encantó ir a esa tienda, recomendada para ahorita que vienen las fiestas para ahorrar lo más posible ahitita que escasea  el dinero.<//text>
