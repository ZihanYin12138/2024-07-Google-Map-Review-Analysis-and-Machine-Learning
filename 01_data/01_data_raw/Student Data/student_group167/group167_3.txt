I haven't had Philippine food is ages, and this tastes just like I remember.  We had the Chicken Adobe, Lumpia and Pancit, and it was delicious!  Prices are good, and portions are large.  Staff is friendly, and very helpful.</review>

<Text>excellent food, service, and exceptionally clean. met the owners and found out they've been open only a month!

i appreciate their dedication to perfecting their current menu rather than sacrificing quality and flavor for menu item quantity. that being said, i am excited to hear they will eventually expand their menu. we will definitely be back and tell all our friends there's a Filipino spot in town.🇵🇭< /Text>< rating>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>I frickin love this place, not just as a Filipina but as a general foodie. The portions here are made for Pinoy dining which means family style. The sinigang, pancit, kare kare, they are all delicious. If you're dining alone, try my favorite all day breakfast items like tapsilog, tocilog, or fish. If you want a fresh taste at Filipino classic dessert, you MUST try halo-halo. My boyfriend and I fight over every morsel and that's kind of the "fun" in this dessert. Every scoop is a surprise.<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNoqM1beHweGyyzWDbXfLBkvPfujpA3ioizWScV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfU-NAYlYQT1g9dCYGSmNipe924bSmCA8tZjLt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNoVLyM3EPj6EOby19s9hDYusKajsfZRDoDNuZk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMan3s0Qu7Z64L0SL8qjhMahCS3l9XpFcomZIwa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgCzv-6O4oXvBrn1t4bsvYFN3yNmaNyCAgvlxD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_T4A0mtTYXfDyym-n7zh9MkVfPxm0mY67-HGi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJziIyEzzk9MgH2NnmKUGdfFi25iEVVxsVuIZJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKR7I-JtdzkCM8Qd7_ksqBFio79FbMLY13lU1N=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Response>

Me and my brother came here to celebrate his birthday. Traditional delicious Filipino dishes. Loved the Pancit and the “purple” ice-cream and fried bananas were amazing! Comfortable family vibe and easy parking.< /review>

I have been craving Lumpia since the place in my town shut down years ago. Friends make it for me here and there but I can never get it when I want it. As kid at one of my friends birthday parties she would also serve Lumpia. It was so good and I've loved it ever since.
I searched for local spots that served Lumpia. Lots came up but only a few in my "backyard ". So we made the drive. The location was easy to find. Parking was easy too. Due to current circumstances they are only serving takeout which was fine for me. The staff was very friendly and helpful with ordering food. The menu has lots of items to choose from.
I came for Lumpia only this trip and it did not dissapoint. I was so elated. I ordered two orders of the pork Lumpia and it was not enough. The Lumpia was cooked just to my liking and the sauce to go with it was a perfect match. When all the Lumpia was gone I was so bummed. Obviously I'm going back it's just a matter of when. Probably sooner than later. I introduced them to my son as well and it was a hit for him</Text>

<review>This 7 month old Filipino restaurant is patronized not only by Filipinos but by the international community as well.
The food is authentic Filipino and they contribute in promoting Filipino food as a  global brand.
Do not miss the Lechon Kawali- crunchiest deep fried pork belly in liver sauce, the Laing Or taro leaves cooked in coconut milk.
To die for a The “Halo-Halo” desert topped with purple yam ice cream. I will surely be back for more.  My only suggestion is to have Dinuguan or Pork Blood Stew🙏🏻!!! Kudos to the owners Ted and Trisha👍<//review><userid>111123144683859861909</userid>< gmap_id>

Food is great. Friendly staff. Fast service. Reasonable price. Definitely coming back. They have a pretty small menu, but they usually have a special dish so don't forget to ask about it, you might get lucky.< /Text>

DELICIOUS!

Growing up in a very large Filipino family, I came in with high expectations and was not let down. On my first(and second) visit I had the pork sisig which they topped with a fried egg and served on a bed of rice and banana leaf. Rich and savory seasoning that brought back some childhood memories. My friend, a white girl whose never had Filipino food beyond Lumpia, had the egg noodle pancit and halo halo; she loved both.

My third visit I had the Lechon(crispy pork belly, pictured). A perfect crispy crust sealed in succulent fatty pork belly.

The restaurant is extremely clean with a contemporary aesthetic and flourishes of Filipino cultural artifacts. Customer service, by whom I assume to be the owners, was excellent every time. I highly recommend for anyone looking to try Filipino cuisine or something different.<//Review>

Reminds me of all the wonderful Filipino food I had while living in Hawaii. Very tasty.  Very friendly service . Food was delicious. We had Pork adobo and chicken adobo. Also lumpia and pansit. We visit here again. One thing for next time. I wish the adobo had pepper corns in it or an option to have it with or without and maybe some bay leaf flavoring I guess it is hard to please everyone when cooking for the mass public but when you say Filipino food we are coming for the real thing. Still give you 5 stars🐼<//Review>

Never crowded when I have gone, haven't seen trash laying around and not loud with people its just a nice pretty park. They have a playground  for kids to play on lots of green fresh grass. There is a firehouse across the street which is hardly just in case along with homes on all sides.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

This park is where the Farmers market is held on Saturday mornings.  Vibrant, local gathering area.  The market is filled with outstanding local fresh grown produce, meats and such.  Nice spot to visit.</text>

<review>I go every Saturday for the huge farmer's market, my kids play at the park while I shop and then we usually grab some lunch from the food vendors! They have flowers, cheese, butchers, fish, vegan cheese, hummus, olive oil, salsas, watermelon 🍉 all the fruits and veggies with some specialty stuff ( micro green guy) Juices and baked good with some of the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever had! Year round!<//review></record>

This park is a stone's throw from the elementary and middle schools in Templeton where my daughter goes to school.  This park has a great public pool open during the summer's, a large gazebo the kids love to sing and dance and play in as well as serves as a stage for caroling in the wintertime, the play structure consists of a tire swing, baby swings and the regular kinda swings. The fire station is right there, and looks amazing covered in holiday lights!<//Review>

< Review>
This is another great park in Northern San Luis Obispo County. It's really easy access from Main Street there is plenty of shade there and rude to BBQ in the Grass Is Always Green and in summertime they have concerts the park. It's really fun spot to walk my dog and have BBQ's, i would recommend it.</Review>

<Text>Great work place to find cool kids and with a nice community to see a variety of people.   Also, there is a pretty fine farmer's market, right now; and a wine festival in this park, during the summer and you have a very scattering restaurant, there!< /Text><gmapID>0x80ecc3544853a311:0xd897d439e97deee< /gmapID>< user_id>

<Pics>None< /Pics><name>Charley Carlin< /name><text>Templeton Park has so many good things going for it. My number one is the great shade trees that dot the park. The free concerts in the summer are always wonderful and the place is packed, I mean really packed. The farmers market every Saturday morning is wonderful with a great selection and often times free music as well. I use the park during the week to stop and have my breakfast burrito from Templeton Market and read a little bit and enjoy the clean well-manicured Park.</text><Response>None<//Response>< user>

Love Templeton Farmers market on Saturday 9 am to 1 pm. Great community pool in the summer time with a little toddler/kiddy pool and a big kid/grown up pool. Great to bring your scooter to use as well. BBQ pits here as well. Very family & pet  friendly as well.<//text>

Very busy park, so if you're taking kids here be mindful of that. The pool is nearby and preschools come here, but it's got lots of shade and a nice play structure.</review>

We love this park. Lots of shade and lots of grass. I gave it one star less because the little bridge that goes across from the monkey bars to the tunnel is open and scary for smaller kids. If there were a couple more bars it would be perfect. I always have to be up on the playground with my younger kids so they don't fall off.<//text>

It's not bad lol. It's just like any other park. But if you do a borthday party in 100+ degree weather, keep in mind the spots to rent there are in the shade 100% of the day? So it felt super cool 😎</Review>

Love Wednesday concerts in the park. Great fun and always fun dancing music. Well with the exception of this past week. They took to long between songs plus took like a 15 minute break. Kinda slows the dancing rythm when they do that. Love the Jammies!  You should get 101 North to play there sometime.< /review>

Templeton Park is a great park for a kids play day or other get together event.

There's a large grilling and seating area with great summer shade. The park itself also has large trees throughout offing lots of large shady spots.

The weekly year round famers market held on Saturday 9am-12 is amongst the best in the country.

They also host a concert in the park series in the summer along with numerous other events year round.

For the water types you also have the summing pool. Which adds a great extra activity for family events held in the park.</Text>

Nice size park.  Decent playground and a lot of open grass areas and several nice tables with bbqs by some. Larger bbq for events. Fairly decent gazebo in center of park. Water fountains and bathrooms as well. Beautiful trees but with younger kids it's worth mentioning that there's not much in the way of fencing or borders from surrounding active streets.  And ants and wasps can be an issue in some parts of the year at this park. Great central location though also near highway,  food,  and gas. Templeton is beautiful if you've never seen it you ought to.</Text>

For the families w/kids, it's the ideal place especially during 4th of July !! The park has a community pool, very nice playground, exercise area for the athletic minded people & lots of picnic tables for family gatherings. Location is a big plus, it's in the downtown area of Templeton w/the Fire Dept. across the street. Good thing on July 4th! ! 👍<//review>

<rate>5<//rate><text>This park is a gem, and what I say is the heart and soul of Templeton. It's walking distance from just about everything in the historical part of downtown Templeton. This park is ALWAYS clean, and has more BBQ's than you can imagine. I really enjoy attending Templeton Park in the summer time for their "Concerts in the Park" series, and for the fourth of July festivities (includes parade, and doing your own fireworks). Great FREE concerts all summer long. Get there early for most events, because they fill up quick, and get very crowded, with a great and polite atmosphere.
Let's not forget the swimming pool at the park as well. This is a CLEAN and fun pool for the older kids, along with a wading pool for the toddlers.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<review>Covid protocol being handled very efficiently.  Ushers help you to your seat, to Communion and in exiting. Advanced reservation is recommended but we always get seated even when we forget to reserve - just have to wait a short time.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<response>None</response><Date>1566222379087<//Date><text>I Love St.Augustine especially the 8:00 Mass. The 10:00 Choir mass is also very good, but NFL starting soon. We got our music & singing back. Thanks to the 8:00 congregation, Ira & Fr Paul
Newly appointed Pastor Fr. Mark is the best preacher in the diocese. Polished & Eloquent, but very easy to listen to. Dynamic, Engaging !!! We’re lucky to have him 🤗🤗🤗
Fr. Paul (miss him) was also very good. I really like his personality, he taught the congregation extremely well. He’s now with our Lord 😉😉😉<//text>< rating>

<Text>I'm disappointed with the new ownership. I am a general contractor that for years has paid extra for items here. Under the new owners they seem to always seem to be out of the most important items. In the past they always had what i needed. Unfortunately I would recommend going to the ace in Pinole.<//Text>< Pics>

Visited July 2, and saw one person not wearing a mask at all, and three employees who couldn't be bothered to pull them above the mouth.

This wasn't the first time in the past three months that I've seen this attitude. I have tenants who I am responsible to for safety, and I expect everyone to be on the same page at this point. My money when possible supports responsible businesses.

Too bad for this store, I have properties to improve and maintain, and they won't be getting any more of my money. I support my community businesses. If they won't support their community by wearing masks, then they've made clear that they don't want my business.< /review>

<Review>This place has been here for years and has given lots of jobs too local kids. They also have everything and some very hard to find things. Went in to try and find one tiny washer I needed for my Harley and they had it! Great prices! Great people!

<Review>Felt discriminated against  by the ladies in the front they greeted the person that came in before me and the person after me, i stood by the front counter to get some help and they ignored me as if i wasn't there, i had to ask in order to get their attention it's funny because they weren't helping or ringing anyone up at the time. The new guy who assisted me find some screws that i needed was great, he has a 5☆ customer service skills.  I found what i needed but i won't go back to that store.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<user_name>Sapphyre Miria< /user_name><Text>I made a conscious decision to shop at this store as opposed to a big box store. I checked the hours on google maps and it states that the store closes at 8. I walked in at 6:57 and was rudely greeted by an older gentleman  with "You have TWO MINUTES to get what you need and get out!" I then ask the man who "greeted" me where I could find the item I had come for and he literally couldn't stop breaking down for closing to help me. I understand wanting to be done for the day but that level of rudeness will keep me from shopping there in the future. Maybe update your hours?!<//Text>< Pics>

<review>It's the best hardware store close to me for small things. I usually go here when I need bolts and nuts for whatever project I'm working on. They have much better quality bolts than home Depot and all the different types aren't mixed up. I hate going to home Depot for a bolt or nut. Anyways, this place has a little something of everything. It's a pretty cool store. Has a huge basement, but there's not much stuff there.< /review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

If you don't like your job just quit don't be a jerk to other co-worker or talk down on them . I had to bite my tongue down to not say anything out of line . That cashier seemed so bitter maybe because she has "been in retail for many years" not sure what her name was Betty? It's not ok even on bad days no need to take it out on customers very unprofessional .</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Always very friendly, helpful and honest. They remember you and make you feel welcome. They'll have what you need and if for some small chance they don't they'll direct you to where to find it or order for you. Great place< /Review>

<text>This place is amazing. They. Have. Everything! The store just keeps going, with another room or row of shelves just when you think you've reached the end.
Old school hardware store that is here to serve both the DIY and contractor. Their prices might be a bit higher than the big bix orange store, but at Oliver's you can actually find an employee, they are always happy to help.</text>< date>

You can be waiting to buy something and they won't come out from the back and try to help you.  And they are super slow to make your food.  I get in the shop at 3:15am and get out 3:40am.. From there
But on the positive side the food tastes and looks good.</text>< Pics>

Not only did they make me wait longer because they gave me the wrong size . But  i found a little piece of metal that came out of my boba. Today while i was drinking it . I bought it  April 1, 2016 at 10:06. I dont get how they can let stuff like this pass. I was lucky enough to not swallow it and catch it before . 😖<//Review>

I really don't leave these.type of reviews...but i'ma make a exception this time. I would give 10⭐'s they were helpful in everything that I had a question with a very professional on making sure other clients we're thought of. Thanks, Jose for getting everything done without me having to go down to the DMV!</text>

<review>I did my taxes here. I had a few different forms and still got a GREAT rate. They were beating other local locations on the rate by A LOT. The tax professionals there are very explanatory and break down everything without leaving any info out. I had originally gone in for a quote, which by the way are free. I will be back next year! THANK YOU</review></record>

Horrible absolutely the worse. Gave me a policy from a company that is getting liquidation due to being so horrible. Then charged me $150 for a new policy, walked in expecting to pay my $70 monthly rate on my car insurance, instead got I'm sorry we messed up here's a bill. They have beaten no one's price by any amount ever! They don't even care enough to give you a new policy after giving out a horrible one.<//Review>

Come on the broker fees are ridiculous, $40 on my $66 policy that used to be $55 which I had to get because you messed up, POS changed the policy you messed up and charged me $75. The $105 on $190 registration. Just because your a immigrants focused company don't make it ok to be taxing on everything. I would like to see how much more you take advantage of people who don't know or have no other choice but to go with your shaddy business.</text>

Please do not go here to get your taxes done.  My husband and I we're audited due to forms being done incorrect. Hrblock is our usually tax preparer but we thought we would save a little money going here. It caused major problems and hrblock did take a second look and showed us what was done wrong! During our appointment the preparer did not seem to know what he/she was doing!  Nightmare! And by the way during our audit not one person in that office would help us!<//Text>

Friendly staff, only bad thing is that literally you have to wait until staff is not helping other clients for you to make a payment that only takes 3 minutes. I waited 40 minutes just to do my payment that only took 3 minutes.</Review>

Garbage experience! Waited literally an hour to make a payment that only took 2 minutes to do. I'm so done, I don't recommend if your ever short on time. They don't care about your time they made that clear today.< /Text>

What is your fave breakfast item? Gotta love potatoes. At Painters Tape, their Potatoes Bravas are yummy and breakfasty. Couldn’t get the soft egg to break tho! Complemented with green beans and Okinawa Hush Puppies - the locals know them as “dango” - it was a great start to the day! Enjoy, and support YOUR local biz!<//Review>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>This is one of the best brunch establishments I've ever been to, and I'll definitely be back! Their fusion approach to breakfast/lunch foods is to die for.

If you're looking for basic breakfast fare, try the breakfast combo -- you'll get a plate piled high with crispy, buttery potatoes, homemade sausage, eggs cooked to perfection, and thick cut buttered toast to boot.

And if you're looking for something not so basic? Well, you have the rest of the menu! Try their iced linguine -- cold noodles in a tomato dashi broth with crisp cucumbers, thin sliced pickled radish, and perfectly grilled sweet corn with a poached egg nestled on top. It's summer in a bowl! And please, don't sleep on their drinks. Their nitro cold brew is delicious, and their yuzu sparkling lemonade is to die for.

The service is impeccable as well, especially with COVID protocols...they are careful to keep folks distanced, and even more careful to clean between parties. Check them out if you haven't already -- they've made a regular out of me! :)< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Went here to try it out and it was definitely worth it. Cant believe I’ve been dodging this spot for a while and now I completely regret it. The food is made with love and the freshest ingredients possible. I don’t have a single complaint. At first I thought the portion that I was given was too small but the food is so good yet it fills you up. Definitely craving more as I’m writing this review<//Text>

Really enjoyed this place. They have really great dishes at really good prices. I came here with a group of 4 and it was nice to be able to share of lot of dishes and try a lot on their menu. Scrambled egg toast, cauliflower, potatoes bravas, and the chicken sandwich were my favorites. They have a counter you order at, then they bring your food out to you afterwards. Love this place and shoutout to the grandma working here sporting the LA hat haha< /Review>

This place is in a category of its own.  It's creative, eclectic, simple and yet every dish bursting with flavor. It makes me want to move to Gardena so I can eat in this neighborhood restaurant every time I leave the house. Don't pass on the Brussels sprouts, fried cabbage salad and curry donut.  But seriously, you can't go wrong with anything in the menu.< /review>

Steps to order - no waiters or table service: 1) grab a pencil and menu, 2) fill out what you want to order by looking at the laminated pictures and marking your choice of food, 3) walk up to the register with your menu and selected items, 4) pay and seat yourself anywhere in the restaurant. Don't forget to grab yourself napkins, utensil, and water after getting your seat. Great idea on restaurant concept. I came during lunch hour so food came out slow and there were 3 chefs in the kitchen in a packed house, every seat was filled. I ordered a peppered fried chicken sandwich and it was DELICIOUS. Fresh ingredients and very juicy and flavorful. Clean food and enough to last me through the office without food coma since I did not order any sides. Recommend but plan on waiting a bit during rush. Parking was tight, you might have to park in street or the plaza next door before walking over. I would come back again for brunch items though, those look amazing.< /review>

Came here this weekend while I was in the area. This place is very unassuming from the outside but the vibe inside is super warm and relaxed.

When you arrive, you mark off your order on a form and bring it to the register when you're ready to order. They give you a number after you pay and you find a table. They mark off your ticket as they bring out your items.

This time I tried the fried chicken bun, pork bun, fried cabbage salad, potatoes bravas and the blood orange hibiscus agua fresca. Everything was so good! The buns they use to make the sandwiches are soft but not too soft to get soggy. The pork was tender and had some melty cheese, onions and a sauce that tied it all together perfectly. The fried chicken sandwich was good too, but I think I liked the pork more. The chicken was moist and well seasoned and the pickles were fresh and crisp. They put a honey mustard sauce on it that was a bit overwhelming to me but overall super good.

The sides were standout to me. The cabbage salad was fresh and crisp; it had a slightly sweet sesame dressing and had avo, tomato and cucumber in it - so good! The potatoes bravas were a nice hat tip to Spanish tapas - they were moist and flavorful and I loved the fried egg on top.

The agua fresca was just the right level of sweet and was super refreshing. Truly, this is a place where I imagine everything on the menu is stellar. Would definitely come back if I was in the neighborhood and want to try some other menu items!!<//review>

Nice mom n pop restaurant with a unique brunch menu. Service was excellent and very friendly. Got the bravas potatoes, which were very flavorful but a little greasy. The fried chicken sandwich was solid but could have had a little more flavor and meat. The yeast waffle was just okay, seemed a little undercooked. Overall the food is good and I'd come here once in a while if I lived nearby, but not quite my go to brunch spot.<//Text>

<review>Weird location- easily missed but should definitely not be overlooked. Food looked and tasted good- I got the Breakfast Special (weekdays) was around $9 without tax. Will come again.<//review>< gmap_id>

<Text>What an unexpected surprise! The food is terrific. It's like some sort of fusion diner... potatoes rosti with pho sour cream and hot sauce, plus a salad of bean sprouts with an Asian inspired dressing $8. Roasted cauliflower with za'tar and harissa cream. Guava passion fruit aqua fresca.  Can't wait to come back!</Text>< Pictures>

The sausage that came with breakfast plate is yummy. They did the eggs perfect. Thought the fusion would be weird but turned out great. Curry donut excellent. Waffle pictured</review>

Hands down, Painter’s Tape is one of the best places in Gardena and the South Bay for brunch. We’ve gone several times since they opened and each time, every dish hits the mark in consistent freshness and high quality. They have fun with their menu and I always want everything: fried cabbage salad; patatas saltado; patatas bravas; pepper fried chicken bun; honey butter chips; fresh fruit with yogurt; rosti potatoes..all of it...enjoy!!
Restrooms: two single stall, gendered restrooms.< /Review>

I don't see the hype about this place. I got the peppered bun chicken sandwich and a coffee, which came up to $14. I don't think the sandwich was anything amazing and definitely not the best bang for your buck. I loved how clean the restaurant and restroom were, but probably would not be returning for another pricey sandwich.<//text>

Painter's Tape is an excellent new breakfast/lunch spot in the South Bay!    I have been there multiple times in the short time that they have been open!  The decor is so cute.  The painter's theme runs through the restaurant - from the custom lighting to the spice jar labels, blue accents on the chairs - even the labeling on to-go orders!   My favorites so far are the Pepper Fried Chicken Bun, the Texas Toast, Breakfast Salad, and the Summer Fruit with Greek Yogurt.  Make sure to try the agua fresca!  It was Strawberry Lychee on Sunday!

One thing to note - the ordering method is a little different.  There are menus and checklists on a table when you walk in the door.  You take a checklist and mark off the items you would like to order and take that to the cashier.  They hand you a table marker and your drinks and then you seat yourself.  Food is brought out to your table as soon it's made - by the chefs themselves!  Pretty cool!

I've noticed that the ramen place next door is closed on Wednesdays, leaving the parking open for Painter's Tape customers!< /Text>

Everytime I go it's empty even with an outdoor eating area which makes NO SENSE because the food is straight amazing. When I want to impress someone I order the honey crisp potato chips. Their eyes go wide at first bite -- and they give me that --"WHAT DID YOU JUST GIVE ME?!'  look...it's my favorite thing to do ever since COVID has made me an indoorsman.<//text>

This place is AMAZING!!!!!
Artisan food with good sized portions at a fantastic price. The plates likes to pretty to eat but just wait till you try it; you'll finish and want another! The garnish isn't just for loss either, it's all a perfect balance they've engineered for a trip into The flavor multi-verse!  If you can't tell, I Love this place on every level!< /Review>

Got a Japanese beef style sandwich I can't recall the specific name of right now. I do remember that it was all kinds of delicious though! It was served with potato chips coated in some kind of honey sauce, they were so good. Loved the interior decor they had inside as well, created a nice atmosphere. Highly recommend!<//review>

Holy moly! If you have not been here, GO! I found this online and decided to go.  We were from out of town and wanted to try something local.  Very welcoming as soon as I walked in.  The food was fresh and so so good! The place was clean and the service was above excellent! This is my go to place everytime I visit now.  Seriously a must try place! Thank you!< /review>

<review>Stopped by for a quick lunch nearby. Painter's Tape was opened by a former MB Post sous chef, which I love going to. The menu is japanese inspired breakfast/lunch cafe food. The restaurant itself is not too big with some tables, regular for groups of four or high standing ones. You first order with the menu pamplet sheets and dry erase markers like at a dim sum place and bring it to the cashier to pay.

I got a yuzu lemonade, which was very refreshing with the perfect sweetness, to drink. And also ordered a shabu shabu burger, which was basically a roast beef sando with kewpie mayo, a katsu BBQ style sauce, and lettuce that came with honey coated potato chips plus a curry cheese donut. The donut was great, with the flavorful curry cheese filling shining through but could've used a bit more to fill the airpocket. Sando was nice but the roast beef was maybe a tad too dry and thinly cut. I really liked the honey potato chips. The coating is very glazed, but still crunchy.

Overall, a cool interesting neighborhood spot for breakfast and lunch.<//review>< response>

This place was awesome. I highly recommend their chicken sandwich with the lunch special where you get the aguafresca of the day and their honey chips. The Texas toast was also really really good. A little sweet but if you want to split with someone I think it's perfect.<//review>

<text>10 years living in Gardena and never thought about Painters Tape as a restaurant, I decide to give it a try, we order breakfast steak and eggs, breakfast specials, broccoli, and coffee and let me tell you the flavors were very different from what I try before, reach flavors, the food look very good, smell great and taste awesome, we really enjoy it everything was delicious, highly recommended the $40 worth totally worth it. I forgot to take pics before eating, sorry empty plates that's how good it was!< /text>< rating>

The food: it was good. It was a fusion of Japanese, Mexican and islander. The coffee was ok, not really impressed, but the curry donut was great. Also the streak and eggs plate was really good as well. They change items sometimes so if you see something you like then go and check it out ASAP.</Text><Rating>4</Rating>< pics>

<Text>The bomb dot com. Been the many times and they don't disappoint. Shabu shabu beef sandwich is a flavor party in your mouth. Also, the honey fries are on point. Highly recommended!</Text><gmapID>0x80c2b582f1985b09:0xc8aba7cd204f09ac</gmapID>< Pictures>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>I had the impression that the place was a dinner since the name made me think it was a breakfast joint for construction workers.  What I found was far from it. However the food was amazing and far a over expectations.  You will find American food that has been fused with asian influences.  It sounds expensive, but the place was very inexpensive.  Try the waffle, it was the best item that I had on the menu so far.<//Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

I could not recommend this place more! This place needs more business! Everyone was so nice and my breakfast plate was cooked to perfection. Toast perfectly crispy, potatoes and sausage had the right amount of salty and savory flavors. Eggs of course tailored to your order. I'd eat here everyday< /Text>

At first I found the menu a little bit small and unsure of what to order. We decided on a burger,  brava potatoes and a waffle to split. Boy was I surprised! Everything is so flavorful and carefully crafted. I loved it! My only recommendation would be the coffee. It's good, as Americans coffees go, but since I'm Latin I usually take it a lot stronger.<//Review>

Soft Scrambled Cheesy Eggs. #SSCE plus a Garlic Sausage #GS
Like “Soft Scrambled Cheesy Eggs” They are delicious.  Garlic Sausage tasty too.
The scrambled eggs have a distinctive taste must try them. I had those two items and was filled with content!

My brother, sister-in-law, and I ordered a lot of different things because we wanted to try it all! (And because I'm only in LA for the weekend!)

Soft Scrambled Eggs on Texas Toast:
This was decent. Could use a touch more salt--not something I would order again for $7.

Japanese Curry & Cheese Donut:
This was OK, too. Again, not something I would die/crave for.

Grilled Zucchini:
Hmm this was okay. If I didn't have anything else, I would eat the whole plate of them, but it was average.

Potatoes Brava:
I actually didn't try this, but my brother and his wife thought it was pretty good. The egg jiggles & yolk ooooozes out onto the potatoes!

Pork Toro Bun:
Basically Pork Belly on bun. This was pretty good, but I wish the pork was more tender.

Pepper Fried Chicken Bun:
This was delicious!! The chicken was very moist, juicy, & flavorful! Would definitely order again!

Shabu Steak Bun:
This one was yummy as well. My fave was the Pepper Fried Chicken Bun.

Honey Butter Chips:
Soooooooo good!! I want more! Comes with sandwich entrees!

Gem Lettuce:
This one was actually our favorite out of all the veggies. So glad I ordered this, despite the fact that the cashier recommended other items that I didn't fancy as much...over this Gem Lettuce Salad!</Text>< user>

< review>
Painter"s Tape is not your father's greasy spoon. They are only open for breakfast and lunch, but don't be fooled the food here is fresh, flavorful and made to order. Menu items are inventive with a modern spin. I had the week day breakfast special, two eggs (sunny side), potatoes, garlicy pork sausage and Texas toast. Sounds simple enough, but the eggs were cooked to perfection, the potatoes (cottage style) were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and well seasoned, but the real stand out here was the sausage patty. Pure porky perfection with enough garlic to play well against the richness of the egg yolks popped and running into the potatoes. A perfect bite. There is no wait staff, upon entering you fill out an order form then take it to the kitchen and seat yourself. When the food is ready one of the cooks brings your order to the table. Drink selection is limited, but what they do offer is delicious agua fresca, coffee and alcoholic offerings as well. Can't wait to sample the rest of the menu.</review>

Cozy, expensive (spent $118 on 4 people)  and a bit minimal , but the food was amazing!! No free refills so make sure bring your wallet . To order just come up fill out a sheet and pay at the counter then they will give you a number then  you will sit and wait for your delicious meal.</Text>

First time here , was kinda sceptic, but when I saw and taste the food , it was a game changer like they knew the right amount of spices and herbs and different ingredients to TASTE , those waffles are dope , we really enjoyed the food , surely will be back and recommend to family and friends.< /Text>

Visiting, what was the original Burnt Tortilla location, we had breakfast totally enjoying each dish.  The passion fruit water was refreshing and spot on, not to sweet or watered down.  The potatoes saltado were flavorful drawing from the Peruvian dish, Lomo saltado.  Great wake up dish!
Followed by the stewed organic rice!  This was the best dish we ordered.  Not sure, what I was expecting but I was delectable impressed.  Looking like a porridge, the rice has a slightly chewy consistent mixed with the hearty yet light chicken and tomato seasoning, made it a comforting flavorful delight.
The Texas toast, a memorable flavor which reminded me of my Dad who would describe eating a Hawaiian version of Melba toast for breakfast slathered with condensed milk.  The inch thick toast covered with the honey and condensed milk made for a simple dessert like quality for breakfast.
Ending with the yeast waffle, the delicate crispy lightness of the waffle reminded me of the Waffle design Liege truck with less heavy feeling.  It was not overly heavy typical waffle, light and airy with the sweet chocolate and banana toppings.  The walnuts give it an added crunch.
The decor was a homage and tribute to their father and his business.  He must be a proud Dad!
Great place and food.  We will be back for more!</Text>

<review>Read the reviews, and came to this spot for breakfast. Awww snap the food was 😋. The owner greeted me and explained the food ordering process. Nice clean, simple design restaurant. I ordered their breakfast special: Garlic sausage patty, toast, pototates , and grilled broccoli in place of scrambled eggs with a yuzu lemonade. Just delicious food and great service, need I say more?! Imma try their fried chicken sandwich next time. This little gem is top notch breakfast food!

<review>Believe the hype! This local hotspot is casual and simple, but beautiful. The food is like Asian fusion food made by actual Asians, so the flavor profile feels modern but still honoring traditional tastes. There are textures, colors, and beautiful plating of each dish. There's tons of restraint in the cooking, and it never feels like it is lacking or trying to hard. It hits that elusive fusion note perfectly.

My bf and I were completely impressed by this and spent half our lunch telling everyone else we knew in the south bay that they should try this spot. We ordered the $12 lunch special (any sandwich, any drink, and their butter chips). We opted for the Pork Toro burger, with seared toro pieces topped with chicharones. It was interesting and savory but not too heavy. The chips were out of this world -- sweet, salty, crunchy. Totally unexpected. I also ordered the fried cabbage salad for $8. This was both our favorite dish -- there's crispy noodles in it, and the cabbage still has a crisp despite being fried. Dressing is present but not overwhelming, and there's slight hints of citrus to freshen it all up. Finally we ordered the potatoes bravas, which were filling and good.

Parking can be elusive in their dedicated lot, but there's street parking around as well. Come and see for yourself. This place is amazing!</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

We tried this place for breakfast and really enjoyed our food. The staff is really friendly and helpful, explaining their ordering system and customer favorites. Both the yuzu lemonade and passion fruit agua fresca were refreshing. Standout dishes were the rosti and fried cabbage salad (which is very light, crisp, and perfectly balanced with the ingredients and dressing). Pepper fried chicken was good, but we couldn't taste any pepper. Can't recommend the pork toro bun, because the fattiness overwhelms everything. We'll be back.<//Review>

I went here today at about 7:15.  I ordered Four sandwichs 12”.  There were 5 people working, but only 1 person helping customers, the other 4 were too busy playing.  The person helping me was the only person trying to do his job. I don’t know what is name was, he was a young black man about 19 years old, thank you for your help, the manager or owner should use you for a great example of a great employee. Thank you again, the other should fine a new job out of customer service.</Text>

<review>I placed my order online and it said to pick it up at certain time, so I gave them 10 extra minutes just in case, well when I got there they just said: sorry we forgot to make your order and turned around like this was a common thing. When they finally got my order, they didn't even apologize or anything just like it really didn't matter.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80d9611e290be321:0xb9ba5515a5d03b6c</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I always prefer this subway because the store is always clean and the employees are amazingly friendly. I just got 3 sandwiches and the staff working at 4:30pm on 8/11 was awesome. They both are a great team. Thank you for the great experience.

<Review>I went there for my fiance Mike who loves the tuna sub. It's the only sub he orders there . It's a nice clean store. Staff was friendly . The only thing I can complain about is Everytime I go to any subway at any time of the day, there is never any broccoli cheese soup. My fiance loves that soup and the poor guy for months has not been able to get any. He is always disappointed when I return empty handed without the soup. I was told it was the most popular soup which is obvious however if you know how popular it is then why wouldn't you want to have more to sell ? Wouldn't you want your customers who love it, able to buy it?<//Review>< username>

<review>My fiance and I went here for lunch. There was another couple in front of us and a long line came in behind us, and there was only one girl working! But she took it like a champ, taking and completing orders with great customer service and friendliness and speed, she deserves a big raise! The sandwiches were as good as any Subway, and I love the location as well!< /review>< pics>

Its subway.  The food is good.  I think other chains have better, but not enough to drive done the hill.

Typically only two people there on weekends, one typically watches the one then rings up the order.  Not terribly efficient management of this store..

Staff is pleasant.< /Review>

Just as others have said, RUDE and incompetent. I am so sorry G's closed, they were personable and the food was great. This Subway hires kids that are without any people skills and are only interested in talking with each other. I was not greeted when I entered, and the cashier didn't say thank you as I left. So I made sure I said thank you in a way she would understand I was not happy with her "lack" of customer service. I will never go back there again, there are to many other choices to have to put up with that crap !!!<//Review>

< Review>
Just before 9 am yesterday morning, I stopped in to get a sandwich for my boyfriend for his lunch.  2 girls at the counter both disappeared into the back room and never came out to ingague with me to take my order.  Music was blaring and after a good 7-8    minutes I just left.  Thank god I wasn't a person that was going to rob or harm them.  The owner needs to take a more serious look at hiring more continuous employees to take care of their franchise.<//Review>

Ordered online, our subs weren't toasted yet the receipt says toasted. I am pregnant and cant eat deli meat without it being warmed first so the $25 we spent for dinner were completely wasted. Couldn't eat my sandwich and ordered online so my husband could bring home dinner. Wasnt going to go all the way back down to town to have it fixed so I just went without. Thanks subway for not giving me what I paid for.</text>

<user_name>Daniel</user_name><review>Pizza Hut is famous and is one of the nation's top pizza franchises. I avoid them if I can. With all fairness however, the Pizza Hut in the Philippines is awesome. It's just all an entirely different experience. They don't have pizza sauce. Instead, they hand you a packet of hot sauce you drizzle on it and it's great.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< user>

Good food.  Better signage - this place works out of a liquor store / U-Haul rental spot, and if you drive by, you'd miss it completely.  I had to call to figure out where to go<//review>

Can't go wrong with the asada tacos. Red salsa is decently spicy. Pretty cheap too, Thursday's they are only a buck< /Text>

<review>OMG, this place is amazingly good! And the lady who helped me out was super nice. I ordered 3 asada tacos and 2 suadero tacos with everything. First time having suadero, but the nice lady let me taste the meat before buying. It was very good. And even better in the taco. Homemade aguas served here as well. All of them are delicious! Definitely coming back... This place is open till 11:30 PM.<//review>< pictures>

<Text>Went to get a tire change and they quoted me at $225 (tire+alignment+labor). They checked to see if I needed more than one tire but decided my other tires were fine. They also checked my alignment but decided the car didn’t need it. They could easily have tried to upsell and charge for services I didn’t need but at the end of the day I only paid $125 for the new tire and labor.

Great service and they won’t try and jerk you around with services you don’t need.</Text><UserId.>111284815386019776400< /UserId.>< date>

<Text>The experience didn’t start off too well with the wrong tires being ordered and me driving my travel trailer across town for no reason. However, the guys at American Tire Depot in Clovis were professional, friendly, and had the correct tires on my trailer the next morning by 9:30. I found a highly rated brand at a better price than anyone else I checked with.</Text>< Pictures>

Needed a wheel alignment and requested free brake and battery check. They got me in same day and were willing to match competitor pricing. I initially found them through Yelp and Adrian the manager was very proactive and communicated often. Definitely will return for any tire needs.< /Review>

<time>1621908553047</time><Text>Had the unfortunate nail in tire situation, called around, most tire shops offer free flat repair. Although my vehicle was in need for an entire new set they heard me out didn’t try to upsell me anything and quoted me very fairly for future. They’re consistently busy and had me come back after 30-45min, repaired my tire like I requested to keep me going for a few more months. They were prompt and respectful. Customer service goes along way even in the midst of a busy non-stop day. I initially spoke to the man at the counter who inspected the tire and consulted with his colleagues and upon coming back to pick-up I was greeted with 2 other individuals in the middle of their routine knowing who I was and what I was there for before reaching the door. Clockwork that I found very impressive. Invested hard working individuals. I don’t remember the other 2 gentleman’s names but I believe the one that did the actual repair was Auggie. Even offered to carry it to my car. Again this was a free service, and to have that much attention to detail and customer service quality goes a long way. Shoutout to the crew and business!</Text><response>{'time': 1619450139444, 'text': 'HI Jaime\nWe are very happy to hear about your experience!

< review>
Having recently moved to Clovis, I wasn’t looking forward to getting new tires and repairs done at someplace I didn’t know. After my wife did a little research, she suggested American Tire Depot. I was skeptical but the team here went above and beyond to make me a customer for life. They worked with my budget and did the research to find the best solution. There isn’t anything I could write in this review to truly some up the gratitude I feel. Thank you to Tony G. and everyone at this location. :)< /review>

<Text>Service was quick, easy, and friendly. Last minute tire replacement due to flat over the weekend. Had to work the day of service, but American Tire Depot was able to start work on vehicle after the tow truck dropped my vehicle off. This saved me time. I appreciate the friendly atmosphere. I know the folks there are busy, but Marcos took the time to listen and give feedback. Good customer service! After going to a specific spot in Clovis, for years, and was turned off by a new employee, it looks like I found a new place to service my vehicles. Thank you.</Text>< gmap_id>

My family has been going to American Tire Depot since they arrived in Clovis several years ago. They are always so friendly and personable. There is never any pressure to get any extra work done on our cars that they kindly recommend. Their prices are very competitive and less than their competitors. They have given us rides to and fro our home when we leave a car there. I highly recommend American Tire Depot!<//text>

<review>I was headed to Sonoma Raceway but noticed the tires on my trailer were shot. So I went to America's Tire with the two wheels/tires and asked if they could mount new ones in an hour.  They could. It took about 5 minutes to get the paper work done and I asked again if they could get it done in an hour. They said it was already done,  just pull up and they'd put them in my pick up!! I couldn't believe they were that fast!!< /review>< rating>

The people that work here are always helpful, never push unnecessary fixes. I was sure my filters needed changing due to the smokey air quality, but alas I was shown the filters and it was suggested no need for new ones.  I will be returning in a few weeks for some very necessary fixes and highly recommend this establishment.  Great people!!!<//Review>

<Review>They have a nice shop, they had some very nice and friendly people at the front counter. They also got the tire job done in about 30 mins, and they matched prices for me and gave me a great price. Only thing is they scuffed the steering wheel on my 2017 BMW 340i and it left about a 2 inch streak of microtears which feels very rough. Not a big deal, they offered for me to bring it in so they can fix it at no cost, I declined and just patched up most of it by myself. Overall good experience< /Review>< time>

The two gentleman in the front made my experience very easy as it was a pleasurable Experience. They had to special order the set of tires that I wanted that were supposed to take 4 days to reach their location and they made special arrangements and put a hot rush on the order and received them unexpectedly to me the next day! They gave excellent service as well as the guys out in the shop that were very attentive to my needs.
I would Highly recommend the Clovis & Fowler location off of Shaw in Clovis to anyone!</Text>

<Text>Do not go here!!! Dishonest technicians!!! They charge for work that was not performed. I was here for 4 tires and rebuild tpms sensors, after I paid for the work I looked at my tpms sensors and all the old stuff was still on????!! They had to bring it back in to redo the work!!! Waste of time!!! Make sure to check the work after if you bring your car here!!</Text>< pics>

I've been a loyal ATD customer since they opened their Clovis location.  The staff is knowledgeable , professional,  and cordial.
Oil changes are competitively priced and completed quickly.   With their huge inventory and price match guarantee they are my go to guys for any tire purchases.
Top notch operation staffed by top notch people- how can you go wrong!<//review>

<text>Went in for my brakes. Not only was it the cheapest place i could find, i was very pleased with my experience. I wish i had gotten the guy's name that helped me... But we talked about living in madera (if that helps management sort out who gets this review). He was awesome. He helped me find the right price that i could afford. He helped me even though he was slammed. I would definitely go back.<//text>< pics>

I been here once and they said that my gaskets were going to break and it would cost upwards of 800 dollars to fix. They were not able to do an oil change because it can break the engine. Fun fact: It's beyond their job. Oil changes are exactly unscrewing a screw and the oil pours out. There is a oil filter next and needs to be replaced by unscrewing and putting a new one there.  Pour new oil in. (There is nothing more needed to do an oil change.)

Honestly I wouldn't trust this place. Be careful with what they< /Text>

<Text>We just moved into the area and started a new job so I called around and this time I just needed the least expensive tires I can get. I usually buy higher quality but I haven’t even received my first check yet. Anyway I called and they were great. So great in fact that they earned my business that same days and did brakes rotors and alignment. Raul was exemplary. You can buy tires anywhere but you can’t find this level of kindness, integrity, and empathy which to me are attributes many sales people could use more of. This is the place we will always go and refer.

Everything went smooth. Great price. No changes from online quote to time of purchase. If anything, they kept calling me Angel, my name is Abel. Lol. I'll come again though.</Text>

I had a wonderful experience today. I heard a noise in my back right tire this morning on a Saturday. I stopped by American Tire Depot in Clovis. The staff was very courteous and took my car In after 12 o’clock on a Saturday. I received a call as promised. My car was serviced and I received a call that my car was ready around 4 PM. Thanks to the staff For such great service in a timely manner. I commute one hour to and from work every day. No time will be lost off work now. Thanks for a job well done keeping me on the road.< /text>

Made an appointment 2 WEEKS IN ADVANCE and they tell me their system automatically cancels appointments after 7 days and sends back the tires. Defeats the whole purpose of an appointment!!!!! Terrible scheduling system.

Also, I had a screw in my tire (reason for the appointment) and the guys said they couldn't fix it. I come across another review saying they fixed someone tire with a nail in it at no cost. Was I being lied to?< /review>

They got the tires I needed at a great price. Truck drives great now! Staff was friendly. I would give it 5 stars but I was there a very long time. I believe 2 hours. Wish that could have been faster but it's a little thing to worry about when it's the price and work that matters.< /review>

Friendly service. Blown a tire after running over something large nearby.  Prices are fair.. didn't have time to really look around. Only thing i would say, took them longer then expected. As it didn't appear to be very busy at the time I stopped in. Almost an hour for one tire? All n all...good tire and the friendly service, i would return ...<//text>

This shop sells sub-par tires with high mileage warranties that are cancelled if you miss any tire rotations. And since they do free tire rotations they make it as hard as possible to get them rotated, like make you wait three hours. The service is terrible, for example I called at 3:30 to see if they were open then get there to find out they close at 4?!< /review>

<Text>The guys here were awesome! I had to get my car towed because I didn’t have a spare and my tire hit a pothole and split. They not only had the best prices, but they had the best customer service I could ask for. They did everything so quickly and explained why I couldn’t just fix my tire even showed me why. Overall I recommend this tire shop to anyone looking for quick service and to be treated respectfully.< /Text>< Pics>

Excellent pricing and excellent service, very timely in completing the install of four new tires.  Their special offer was an unexpected bonus. This is my second time at American tire, both times I received excellent service.</Review>

Great service and experience. Called and got a quote. Justin was able to get my tires the same day and get me in within the next 30 mins. I was in and out within an hour. Which is the fastest tire service I’ve experienced and he had to go pick up my tires from another location. Thanks Justin! On top of the service the warranty on the tires are amazing.< /Text>

Update: Thank you to Tony the district manager for taking the time to look into all that went on between all my visits. I appreciate him for making this situation right and giving great customer service when interacting with me over the phone. He was prompt and made sure that I would receive the correct tire size and replacement for my vehicle after the store put the wrong size tires on my car in May. Thank you, Tony.

If I can give zero stars I would!!! Worst company to do business with. Dishonest, rude, and they are all about making a dollar over customer service. The work they do is faulty and then they don’t make it right. How can a tire place put directional tires on the wrong way??? And how can they charge you for something they messed up on. They place a new tire a month ago, had to replace it because it was faulty and then charged me for all the parts and labor and disposal because “only the tire was under warranty “  Justin was rude and said I and my husband don’t know how things work when it comes to warranties. The lack of communication and up front honesty was no where to be found.  Please you’ll take your business else where. If not you’ll have problems for sure! Unfortunately I had to go back because of the warranty on the tire. Plus they treat women like they don’t know what they are talking about. I have reported them to the better business bureau.< /Review>

<review>Im not very knowledgable of what upkeep a car needs. But the ride was always very bumpy & noisy. ( I put my car through alot). My brother advised me to take it to American Tire Depot. I have no idea what type or kind of tire it needed. The gentlemen made several suggestions. I left it up to them. When I picked up the car, I noticed right away how smooth the ride was & quiet. Considering the way I drive this vehicle.
Thank you! 👍<//review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<Text>Took the wife’s car in for an oil change and wheel alignment and couldn’t be more satisfied. The staff there are really prompt and professional.  The price was very fair and I will definitely be a return customer. I also purchased a set of brand name tires from this business last year and had the same quality service in addition to a very reasonable price. No other business came close to their price point.

Been buying tires here for years, since my first car, literally! Always great prices and the people there are great. Only thing I advise is to save your receipts because they may come in handy when needing to get a tire warrantied out.</text>

Went for all new tires, they actually notified me that I only needed 2 replaced in addition to an alignment, costing less than was quoted.

I've done business with American tire depot in the past and I feel very compelled to leave a 5 star review for this company. My last encounter was at their Clovis store and the staff was extremely courteous and professional!  Not only did they take care of my vehicle on a busy day without an appointment but they also took the time to drive me to work while they worked on my car.  Justin I believe is the store manager who went above and beyond to ensure I received excellent service. My vehicle underwent some maintenance and repairs and I am completely satisfied.  Thumbs up guys! Great work! Hopefully you will continue to help us with a 😃!<//Text>

Well they didn't seem to take much care of my wheels. A few nicks and scratches. Also the tires had 80 psi in them. The tire says 65 psi max on the side wall.< /Review>

Thank you Justin for all of your help!  Justin was amazing,  I needed help with my tires that  had a few bubbles on it.  I work in Bakersfield and had to be here.  It was going to take a few hours to order my tire and get it done.  I didn't have the time, I had to be at work.  Justin made it happen and got me back in my car and I was on my way.  I have been telling all of my friends and family about the GREAT service that I received!   Great honest customer service!!! You can trust this place! I have been there a few times and have ALWAYS received great service!!! THANK YOU AGAIN JUSTIN!!!!< /Text>

<review>I have never been here before. My tire kept leaking so I stopped by because they were not too busy. John who was at the desk was very nice and I was in and out in a half hour and no charge to repair my tire. I am very pleased with American tire and I will return for any needs that I have
Since I wrote this original post I need to add to it. I have had to have my tires repaired four times and today I went in with a huge nail in the wall of my tire and had to buy a new tire. Everyone was extremely nice and because they knew me so well I was in and out of there quickly. I have three daughters with down syndrome and we were on our way to Hume Lake with my sister and Albert and Tony were very gracious and managed  to get us in and out of there in less than 30 minutes<//review>< Gmap_id>

I believe the manager's name was Justin he apologized as he was short two technicians it took an extra minute to get to us in the waiting room we watched while he dressed a few tires and took a vehicle of a rack and moved it to the parking lot they worked as a team quickly and efficiently this is the way all businesses should run, bottom line service was excellent tires and alignment are above what I expected, like to add I had just left Les Schwab Tire Center ,we will return for other services.

I took my car to get an alignment because my car pulled to the left while driving down the road. After the first alignment it pulled to the right. The next morning I brought it in for the second alignment and it still pulled to the right (a little less than before). I brought it back for the third time and I just called to see if it’s good after the third alignment and they said “it still pulls to the right, do you want us to make it straight?”. Well why would I bring it for an alignment if I didn’t want it to drive straight? Of course I do! Also the car has no damage to it so it’s not like they can’t make it straight because something is bent. Maybe go somewhere else for an alignment...<//text>

I came in at the last hour because every other tire shop was closed. Had a unrepairable flat that needed to be replaced. They found a size that fit the wheel but didnt want to install it due to it not matching my car specs. They didnt have the right sizes pertaining to my car as well. I had a hard time convincing them but since it was an emergency he let it slide. Got my tire and on the road i went. Thanks you guys made my night!! just dont give us a hard time especially if we just need a tire to get home.<//Text>

Please take your vehicle work elsewhere. I have many problems with this shop. First, I really feel like they take advantage of their customers, especially those who might not have any knowledge of cars, I know having work done on your car isn’t cheap; when I went to install 4 new tires they checked for other things that I need to fix, all of which cost $100+ each. I think it’s great that they check for other things that you might need to fix but all I wanted done was the installation of my four new tires. I already have a mechanic and with them telling me I needed 4 additional things fixed I would prefer that someone else look at my car and see if I really needed all those things done, a second opinion. I feel like they’re too pushy and they make you want to have to fix something. They told me I needed new breaks and that they could do them but I declined, later when I had my mechanic look at my breaks he said that they were fine and don’t need to be fixed. When they were installing my tires, they asked me if I had any work done recently, and I said yes, the guy showing me said that the screws were on really tight and they need to take them off first so they can get the old tire out and put my new tire on. He said that there was a strong possibility that it might break and if it did I would need to pay guess what another $100 to fix that. I told him that I didn’t have the money to pay for that the only money that I had was for my tires, so I dont know what to tell him if it broke and I didn’t have the money to pay for it. There was no way around those screws either I had to get them off to install my tire, if they broke or not. At that point it was kind of funny after I told him that I didn’t have the money to pay for it, if it did break, he looked as if he wishes he didn’t tell me that it would cost that much. What he said next was very strange. He said that I can pay him $20 instead, not the $100? The fact that it went down from $100 to $20 is odd to me, it left me thinking if it really did cost $100 to fix that or if they’re just saying that and trying to take advantage of me so they can get as much money out of me as they can. It was strange because I think I seen a sign saying that you can make monthly payments if you couldn’t pay for something at the moment I don’t know.  Thankfully it did not break and I didn’t have to pay anything additional. If you do go here be smart and don’t believe everything they say, get a second opinion so you don’t have to waste money on something that doesn’t even need fixing. The only reason I went here is for new tires, other than that I would have never did business here. Get a mechanic that you can trust, someone that’s going to be honest with you. Don’t recommend, not doing business here again. Wish I could give them 0 stars.<//review>

<Review>I called prior to going in and the guy who helped me answered all questions I had over the phone. They didn't have 4 tires in the price i wanted but still they accommodated me with another brand that was better then the orginal ones I wanted for the same price! I let them know i thought i needed new breaks and rotors on front & back. They called me within 25 mins to give me an update and told me i just needed them on the front, most places would hustle you for your money. This place is legit & the workers are friendly with great attitude & reliable! I will definitely be going back again 😊< /Review><resp>None< /resp></record>

The service was so slow that it took about 4 hours to change oil and 4 tires, even I had called in a day before. They overcharged me with added options that didnot make sense. I wish I were more careful to these riffoff artists at American Tires Depot in Clovis. And I will never go back there again.< /Review>< rate>

1 great prices
2 friendly service
3 well knollagable employees
4 have free inspections for some things
5 I like that they let u know what else needs to b fixed and show u the problem not just tell u about it and they ask u if u want it repaired during your services.

I'm picky about who works on my vehicles and have had bad experiences w other company's but by far this is my favorite place to come.<//Review>

Excellent tire shop. Glenn is great, very personable and customer service was terrific. Will be going here from now on instead of the other guys down the street. Oh, and they beat the other guys buy half price for what I needed done!</text>

Went there for a buy one get one free tire sale. Purchased four tires for the price of 4 tires. I literally saved about $20 total on all four tires compared to the shop down the road. They said it would be 45 minutes it took almost 2 hours and they were supposed to check the front end alignment for free which they never did. Don't waste your time go to your neighborhood tire dealer< /review>

Came back for a flat repair on my wife’s car. Was met walking to the store in the parking lot by an employee asking how they could help. Explained neede a flat fixed. Walked into store counter, asked if I had been there before, said yes and he found me in system.  Discussed nature of flat, went back out to look at the tire to confirm, said no problem and took tire back to store. Asked me if I wanted a call when complete, said I would wait. Told me ahead of time 2 customers before me. I said ok and had a seat. About 30 minutes later he called my name, told me he had already put the tire in my truck. I said thank you, finished up the tag, I asked cost, he said no charge. I was stunned and didn’t know what to say. His words were let us know when we can help you in the future. Excellent service in my opinion. Thank you!<//Text>

Stay away!
The service used to be awesome but it is horrible now. They quote for labor that other mechanics report are not needed and "forget" to do certain things. During my last trip, I asked for tire rotation since they were bought here. I marked my tires only to discover that they had not been rotated. I was also quoted with other "mechanical issues" that two other mechanic shops reported were "BS."< /Review>

Stay far far away from this place.  Let me tell you about my experience.

Problem number one.  They changed the wrong tire, but I understand people can make mistakes, so I let them correct this.

When I returned, one of the mechanics informed me that my tire pressure sensor was "crumbling" and that he replaced it for free.   Problem now was that they couldn't sync the vehicle computer to their "new" sensor.  They instructed me to drive it home and that it would eventually reset.  Well, It didn't.

I returned the following day and was told to follow up at the Blackstone location.  Well, half my day wasted later, they were also unable to sync it.  Now, I was referred to the dealer.
The car was taken to the dealer the next day and after spending half a day with them, they gave me the car back stating they did not know how to resolve the issue.  Great, back to American!

I now had the pleasure of speaking with Edward, the manager (who hired this condescending prick?) who likes to put blame on everyone but himself.  I even had the pleasure of watching him yell at his staff in front of customers and talk negatively about a customer who didn't want to spend 2000.00 dollars on auto repairs as the customer walked away.  He kept stating how he doesn't have the 50K tool to sync and maybe corporate would now send him his special tool.  Red flag!

The final fix was taking my Lexus back to the dealership (total 3 times) and having them put on a Lexus TPMS sensor (per my request) and bam.  Works!  What's funny is that the mechanic at American Tire tells me the sensor was "crumbling" when he changed the tire, but I know how easy these things break if the tire change is mishandled.  Worked perfectly before and nobody gives stuff for "free."  $250.00 later (price of one tire that I purchased from American), I felt they were responsible for this charge.  I was told by Edward that he would contact me within 4 weeks.  I gave him 6 weeks.  He has now dodged my calls and not returned my calls twice, so now corporate will hear my extended version and I hope any potential customers of this place will look elsewhere, because if you find yourself in a complicated issue with this location, don't expect any resolve.

Also, read the Yelp reviews.  There is a similar story from a member named Matthew, but then again, just refer to all the 1 star reviews to make a decision.< /Text>

<user>108982914109486066023</user><username>Matteo Capanna</username><Time>1539204342345</Time><Rate>5<//Rate><review>I needed some new tires as my 215/50R17 MXM4 Michelin tires had failed to hold air at 3/32.  I would describe the tread as flaky with moderately cracked side wall to boot after nearly 4 years of use.  Let's just say they didn't make the 55,000 mark but I did a little more dirt and gravel driving than most people expose their tires to.
Knowing that I would be doing less rural and more highway driving I want something quite, comfortable, with some honest longevity.
Having purchased many tires of different brand and quality, I put Justin at ATD through the paces finding just the right tire for my needs.  I told him what I wanted, what I didn't, and what I currently was looking at.  After narrowing down the field, we battered around impression of a few tires.  Not only was the service and price excellent, we found a solution that could be installed the same day. I appreciate them getting me out the door to pick up my kids on time from school.  Thank you so much for the great tire buying experience!
So you're probably wondering what tires I chose?  Yokohama Avid Ascend GT.  It's only been a trip to Pismo for the weekend, a little rural driving in Templeton, and a couple days of usual driving in Clovis and Fresno.  My impressions: The Yokohama hands down better traction the the Michelin ever had, I'm truly impressed with the grip on clean flat roads, sandy roads, and oddly shape dips on hilly roads.
Next they are slightly noisier than than the MXM4s, but you can only tell that with the radio off, so not a deal breaker.
Both tires are 95V rated and the handling is similar.  Putting the tires through the paces is not wise when this new, but it handled all the curvy roads in a comfortably agresive manner without my wife saying slow down, yet again impressive.
These tires act like a performance tire, but feel more like a touring tire, you may or may not appreciate that feeling, and can be a little unsettling to the agresive driver who likes the connected to the road feeling normally associated with performance touring or sport tires.
Logevitity is yet to be seen, but Yokohama has a great reputation in that department.

So did I get everything I was looking for in new tires for my 2003 Acura TL type S?  I seriously doubt there was a better choice for me and my car, especially at this price.  Let them find the right tire for your needs at the right price.  Don't forget to check for rebates.< /review>< pictures>

At lest 5 people already helped and 2 more in line. Justin was very honest and let me know if my wait time, this was vary curtious due to my schedule. I was able to make an appointment. And was treated very well. The only problem was that my tires did not have proper amount of air. I was very happy. They are very honest here. I asked for them to check my alignment since I did not have to spend money due to tire issues. My pricing for alignment was very competitive. I’m very pleased and will be a faithful customer due to their honesty. Two othe employees I would like to acknowledge is John and Auggie. John is alway very helpfully and informative. This trip back I was able to meet Auggie. He smiled and greeted me and informed me about my vehicle and that he test drove it just to be sure my tire light did not come back on. This is above and beyond the best place to do business. Thank you for hiring kind people.

Love,

<Review>I had an amazing experience with ATD. They helped me get my car repaired for a fraction of what is would cost at other shops. Glenn wasn't trying to be a salesman, we had a genuine conversation and I am glad to have met him and talked with him. I will be coming back to American Tire Depot for future repairs, oil changes, and new tires.
Baltimore is currently helping to repair my car and I couldn't be more grateful for him. I was about to give up and he saved the day and got the business for American Tire Depot.</Review><rate>5<//rate>< GmapID>

<Text>I will NOT recommend American Tire Depot in Clovis
My husband told me that I need to change tires on my Toyota Sienna (2014), and I should go to American Tire Depot in Clovis, because only they have K* tires. He warned me that it will take 3 hours to change tires. So, I called on Monday morning to get appointment for Saturday, because I didn’t want to waste my time waiting. Some staff member took all my information and told me that he will call me back because it’s special order. I waited two days – never got any call back. On Wednesday I called again, wondering what is going on. Another staff member with older voice (unfortunately I don’t know his name) was very helpful, entered all my information through their website, so I can get online discount. I told him that I want to get appointment for Saturday, because it’s long waiting time. He said that it’s not necessary because waiting time is approximately ONE hour, and my car would be served as soon as it possible. He gave me confirmation number.

When I came there on Saturday morning at 10am, it was a lot of cars on a parking lot. I talked to younger staff member, gave him confirmation number, but he had hard time to find it. Later he told me that it was hard, because it was different first name on my order. ??? Sounds strange, because confirmation number and car information were correct, he could just clarify name. Also, I believe he was that staff member, who I talked on Monday and who got all my info and never called me back. I asked how long it will take to change tires. Hour? He said that longer. Two – three hours? He answered yes. ??? But on Wednesday I was told that only One hour! Ok. I didn’t start argue, just asked to call me when it’s ready.

Three hours I was killing my time at Sierra Vista Mall. No phone call. After three hours wasting my time, I came back to American Tire Depot. They even didn’t start working on my car!!! I went in the office all furious. Likely for me it was another staff member (older man, most likely manager), he got my folder and went to check what was going on. Came back and told me that they will start to work on my car right away. He told me that it happened because three cars came at same time. Really? It was just excuse. Because, I never saw customer, who was behind me in a morning, while I was waiting for another hour in a waiting room. His car got served before my car??? I have strong feeling that my car was put behind everyone else’s car just because I wasn’t sitting in the waiting room and couldn’t control situation.
Unfortunately I was so mad that I didn’t ask their names, and didn’t complain to the manager.

My main complains: 1. I was told that it will take one hour, but it took 4 hours!!! 2. I wanted to make appointment and they didn’t accept it. They could recommend me another day of the week if Saturdays are crazy. 3. I wasn’t warned by staff member that it will take more than 3 hours. If I knew it I would just turn around and go back despite that I live in Auberry and spent 45 minutes driving down to Clovis. That waiting ruined all my plans for the day.

On the top of everything, when I was driving back home, I decided to check how car drives at the speed 70-80ml per hour on freeway. It was shaking after speed reached 70mph. When I had my old tires, it was never that way even over 80mph. I’ll check if tires wasn’t balanced properly and update my review.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<text>I have been a customer of America's Tire Depot at the Shaw Ave location for over a year and a half, and have waited to write this review to see if things could improve. During my time as a customer, this store has gone through three managers and numerous employee changes in the shop. Though the personnel are nice and knoweledgable, there is still a huge disconnect and lack of organization in getting the work done. This has led to numerous appointments being made either online or by phone getting lost, or unacceptable wait times when they do remember your appointment. It took over 4hrs to get tires and an alignment with an appointment this last time, and sadly was not an isolated incident. So why do I go back?!... unfortunately, I am locked into a warranty battle. I originally purchased a set of four tires with a 45,000 mile warranty on 06-09-16. Almost a year later at only 4/32nds tread wear left  and 16,500 miles on the tires respectively, the tires were too worn for them to rotate any longer due to safety reasons, but not worn enough to warranty the tire. All rotations, alignments, and any other work suggested by ATD was done over that course of time. I continued to rotate the tires myself and bring the wear down to 2/32nds respectively and 22,000 miles. While they did eventually prorate the tires, increased fees on the same tire, labor, and the expired promotion that the original set were purchased under brought the 50% off proration total to nearly the same cost I originally paid on my first set. My advice, call around and compare estimates. While tire prices can be good here, by the time you add up warranty certificates, and shop labor, the cost of their tires overall may not be a great deal when compared to other companies that offer these services as part of the purchase. Also, with the lack of organization, long wait times, and hassle proving your warranty and infringing on your time as a customer, any cost savings, if any, are negligible.</text><GmapID>0x80945b939952358f:0x8d7bcd6444be7b62< /GmapID>< pics>

<user>113097030617950779371< /user><text>The service here used to be great. I bought 2 tires and alignment service recently. I was supposed to recieve a call when my tires arrived and did not get one. I had to call them. Once at my appt. I asked for my tires to be rotated as well..... they didn't do it either. Once i got into my car i noticed black residue the tech left from his hands and boots on my carpet and door. They couldnt put down a protective paper? I'm not even confident they did the alignment. I remember them having great service before and even applying tire shine to all the tires....guess that great service is in the past. I will not be returning here.</text></record>

Horrible service first they lied to me said Fresno store had tire in stock. I take my car on a flat they don’t have it. I then had to travel another 15miles to there Clovis store. They charged me 70 dollars to put 2 tires on crazy crazy. So if you figure the tire is 20 dollars cheaper here goto the place you originally spoke to. Cause they will charge you anywhere for 70 dollars to 120 dollars just to put tires on your car. I was completely disgusted with this company lack of communication and poor quality of service remember if it’s anywhere from 40-20 dollars cheaper here don’t go not worth the drive an the lying. They might not even have your tire I called to confirm an they said they had it but of course they didn’t beware</text>
