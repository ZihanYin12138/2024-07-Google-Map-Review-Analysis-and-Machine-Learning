The customer service was phenomenal!!! I was treated with the most respect and was comfortable under the COVID 19 distance requirements.
I was given a great deal. Not to mention for climate control it was the cheapest deal I found.</review>

<Text>We had water damage to anything that was in a cardboard box! It probably happened in the big storm we had a while back. The floor got flooded!

Went to the office to report the situation and got the lecture about buying their insurance. I HAVE insurance - just a $500 deductable - and probably not that much damage. The clerk asked if I wanted to vacate the unit or let them fix the problem. Right, like they are going to get around to fixing it before it rains again. Besides, it's moldy in there! Told him I wanted a new unit.

He says he will take pictures of the damage and he will meet us at the unit as soon as he's done renting a unit to the guy ahead of us. We go to the unit and wait. And wait. And wait.

Finally even my wife's patience wears out and she walks back to the office and he tells her he thought we left??? Shelly tells him we've been waiting for 45 minutes! So he says he'll be there "right after helping his current customer." A different customer than was there before.

15 minutes later and we're STILL waiting at the unit. At this point I wouldn't have taken a FREE room from them. We packed up all the damaged stuff (lost an artificial tree and some Easter stuff to water damage and mold) and left. When we were leaving the guy was helping yet ANOTHER customer. No, pay no attention to the people who have been waiting for an hour!

On a brighter note, this awful service may have been the result of just one employee. When I moved everything out of the unit the clerk who I usually have contact with was very understanding. Nevertheless, I now have a new unit at a different storage company.< /Text>< rate>

<Resp>None</Resp><Review>I'm a frugal engineer, and I needed 200 sqft of storage, and had some items that needed climate control.  The price difference for the climate control was only 15%, so I rented two 10'x10' climate controlled units.

The next day I went to load my belongings and believed the units were much smaller than the contracted 10'x10', so the manager said we would measure them together along with all the available units and he would give me the two largest units.  We spent about an hour looking for the largest units, and the ones I got were a little larger than 10'x10'.

I was very pleased with the service, the cost, and their online payment methods.  I recommend this company to anyone looking for storage.<//Review>< user_id>

<review>It wasn't bad but I was having problems opening the gate the number they gave me did not want to open the gate and I called the office and they said somebody should be there but nobody was there I think they should have somebody on the property at all times while it's there opened to assist you I think that would improve their storage facility what overall they're not bad in the prices very helpful but I suggest they have somebody on premises at all times at that when something comes up you don't have to give a phone call to get somebody to go there and be stuck in there for an hour or two I was in there about an hour and I could not get out

Someone broke into my unit in the past two weeks, that person broke my lock took some items and put on a different lock. This place is not secure at all, the office never called me to let me know. It's more like Secure Care yourself. Take a risk.  I pay every month. Very unhappy.<//text>

(Translated by Google) It is not a good place to store your things, it is not safe at all, they steal very easily the cameras have them as ornaments, the only thing that interests them is to receive their money and security for you, there is nothing anyone can enter, I do not recommend you take their service from me. They stole and the response from this place was it's your problem. In the back there are no cameras and if you ask about the fence it does not cover much. not a week passed and they opened again what kind of service is this

No es buen lugar para guardar tus cosas no es nada seguro roban muy fácilmente las cámaras las tienen de adorno lo único que les interesa es recibir su dinero y seguridad para ti no hay nada puede entrar quien sea no te recomiendo agarrar su servicio a mi  me robaron y la respuesta de este lugar fue es tu problema . Por la parte de atrás no hay cámaras y si preguntas por el cerco no alcanza a cubrir una gran cosa.       no paso una semana y abrieron otra vez que clase de 💩😝 de servicio es este< /Text>

<Text>If I could only give more stars...Clarity Car Washing deserves them.

David did an interior and exterior detail on my Honda S2000. I couldn't be happier with the results. He comes with all the equipment he needs to do a thorough job. He uses high quality Meguiar's products, which I feel are the best in the automotive market. And most importantly he spent the time and effort to do a job that he was proud of...and it is MY car!

It had been a long time since my car had a thorough cleaning. Now, all the nooks, crannies, and crevices are clean. The shine is amazing. The leather seats look like new. Even the convertible top looks like brand new.

Clarity Car Washing deserve kudos and comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Thanks, David!< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvt3MR9GGPLL9xZ7hJb1M-EythyGmNw1_gJjwT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzry3OptoJN6XBu7iwpOb3FzyDaYrJdJr_eWNm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80dbfd7cb44a4ea9:0x1f2fe999a722dea2< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>David gave me  the very BEST car detail I've ever had!  He spent 6 hours on my car and it was cleaner than the day I bought it.  I also appreciate that because of the superior waxing job, the rain will bead up on the exterior and my car will keep looking clean.  I will be passing out David's business cards to my friends!  Clarity Car Washing IS the best!  I feel like I now have a brand new car!< /Text>< Pictures>

I did not initially realize that it was mobile detailing, but it was very convenient to have services come to me! He was about a half hour late to arrive, but did compensate us by not charging us for the extra time it took. My husband and I were both very happy with how clean the carpets and upholstery were! My husband did notice that the inside of his windows were missed (still had smudges from the dog's nose), but overall everything came out great! I definitely recommend and think it was a great value!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Text>David is first class His attention to detail is very notable!  David even removed a few stain on back seat. If I could only give more stars, David deserves them. David did an interior and exterior detail on my 2018 Honda HR-V. I couldn't be happier with the results. He comes with all the equipment he needs to do a thorough job. He uses high quality  products, which I think are the best in the market. And most importantly he spent the time and effort to do a great job  Looks as good as the day I drove the car of the lot. THANKS David!!! Highly recommend him I will use again<//Text>< Date>

I recently bought a used car and it really needed a thorough cleaning/polishing/waxing inside and out. David really brought my car back to life and made it feel new again! He was also able to remove some scratches in the paint. Super impressed by how hard he worked and how detail oriented he is. Best detail ever!< /Review>

And he was! And my car looks killer! Just on the inside he spent over 5 hours working on and it is IMMACULATE! There was husky fur EVERYWHERE and my kids crush snacks into the floor etc.....it looks new.

And this is SO affordable. Insanely good prices. THANK YOU DAVID!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80dbfd7cb44a4ea9:0x1f2fe999a722dea2<//gmap_id></record>

I did not meet David in person; however,  he was a great communicator and my family said he worked for about 5 hrs on my SUV. I could instantly tell when I came home and saw my truck he takes a lot of pride in his work and that is something rare these days. I would definitely recommend David to anyone who takes care of their vehicles. Thank you David!< /review>

David Sinclair did an absolute amazing job cleaning my car exterior and interior.  He showed up completely prepared, products, hoses, generator he had a canopy to cover my car. He took care of every detail. When he was finished my car looked like it just drove off the showroom.  I will recommend  him to all my friends and family. He is very reasonable</Review>

David did a great job on my F250, big job to tackle. He spent almost 5 hours detailing my truck, it looks great. I pointed out a few little spots and he made sure everything was to my liking before departing. Very reasonable pricing.
Dont hesitate to have your vehicles detailed by David!</Review>

David did an amazing job on my car. This detailing was a gift from my wife and I asked her to let me write the review as the car was immaculate when I returned from my trip. David made my 2013 Acura look nearly brand new. He got out marks on the paint that I thought were permanent, made the leather look fantastic, and got all of the dog hair out of the back of the car. His detailing is fantastic and a good value. I will be calling him soon to do my wife's car :)</Review>

Met David in Mission Hills as he was working on another car.  We stopped in the middle of the road and introduced ourselves and got his business card and as soon as we got home went online and made an appointment for last Saturday.  I really don't have anything more to add then what has already been said about this heads up guy, he did a great job on our little Mazda CX5 and my wife approves and gives 5 stars too.  You will not be disappointed in his work.<//text>

<Text>Yesterday was the second time we had our small RV (19 ft long, 8' 3'' high) detailed by David, the owner of Clarity Car Washing.  He again did a fantastic job making our 2001 RV look brand new. My wife and I are so impressed with his focus on detail and making sure that we are pleased with his work. In addition, David is one of the nicest and compassionate young people we know.  We recommend David for any vehicle detailing you may need and do so without reservations of any kind.

I have had detailing in four different states with multiple companies and while all were good, David was great. I was truly impressed by David’s  professionalism, customer service, and dedication to his work. My car honestly looked brand-new when he was done; it certainly was no small task since three kids practically live in that car. The amount of cracker crumbs and milk stains was certainly shameful but now it’s all but a distant memory thanks to David. Looking forward to hiring him again for my next detail.

Positive: I appreciated that it was pet friendly ¿ but putting all the people with dogs next to one another is not necessarily the best idea ¿ just because some dogs are more reactive to other dogs... it was conveniently located but maybe too close to the freeway Negative: odd smell in room & had to open window to air things out. Couldn¿t get the smell out of the bathroom. No hairdryer. Strange people in the parking lot, my dog was restless & on alert all night which meant I got zero sleep. Aesthetically room needed help<//Text>

The hotel had an adjacent lot that was good for walking the dog.  The area was near food establishments.The room was clean and fine to stay in, no dog odors. However the lobby and hallway area smelled awful, it was a sickening sweet, GI bleed sort of odor.  If it hadn’t smelled so bad my review would have been better.From the outside, you could see several of the rooms either had torn or missing window screens.  This appears to be primarily a long-term residential hotel.</text>

<resp>None</resp><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Text>Stayed one night in this hotel. We had recently stayed in the La Quinta by the airport in San Fran and was really impressed with it so sought out La Quinta for this trip. Unfortunately not all are equal. The room we stayed in was on the ground floor and smelled of smoke. Despite it being a non-smoking facility there we noticed a few people smoking right at the entrance and exit doors. It appeared the room hadn't been updated in a while and the wear and tear showed. For instance, the carpet goes up the wall a couple of inches and there was a section that had been stapled back on from a desk stapler, curtains were dingy, the fan in the bathroom was sounded like a jet plane, and the shower made a high pitched sound when on. The room had a door that went to an adjoining room and considering we are in a pandemic, we were a bit surprised that the room had someone in it. I try not to judge, but the person appeared to have some issues and at 3am we learned those issues were drugs based on the heated argument we could clearly hear coming from the room. We called the front desk and they were able to get them to be quiet. I do question though being in that situation in the first place - being that we had two kids with us, I would hope that the staff would have recognized this was not a good placement. I mentioned this to the staff person as we were checking out and she seemed far less attentive than the person that checked us in or the person we called in the early morning.<//Text><userid>None< /userid>< gmapID>

Terrible. The staff were extremely rude. The front desk girl, Afton, was especially rude. If I had not paid for my trip already, I would have just left after experiencing her lack of understanding professionalism and poor customer service skills. The room was dirty and missing normal things that one might find in the room (sheets, hair dryer, coffe maker, cups, etc). Do not waste your time or money here.</Text>

I think this is a 3 star hotel, but feels like a slight upgrade from a motel 6. Rooms smells a little. A towel was dirty with spots. It feels like an old hotel just renovated a bit. Tap water seemed a little like the water that comes from McDonald's bathrooms. Because of Covid, no breakfast. Outside in the parking lot they say it's safe, but it seems sketch because we keep hearing random people in the parking lot. I'm not sure if pets are allowed in hotels, but definitely were annoyed by a dog and people who kept coming outside our room door. Speaking of hearing the dog, you can hear everything outside your door as if there isn't a door. I will say though that the front lady was nice and helpful, probably best part of the hotel was her customer service.</Text>

< Review>
The property was unkept. There were broken down cars in the lot and transients in and out of the hotel. It is obvious that homeless we’re staying in the rooms which was undisclosed. Although masks were required, the homeless we’re walking around inside without them. There was rarely someone at the front desk. The facilities inside were dirty and lacked maintenance. The mattress and pillows were substandard and the carpeting needed cleaning. I have stayed at La Quinta in the past and been satisfied but have never seen something like this and will not be doing so in the future.<//Review>

<review>Haven't traveled in awhile due to Covid but I was surprised by this place. Maintenance in general made the place look shabby. Pool and jacuzzi unused and filthy as the view from our room. Sketchy characters roaming the property and in the halls. One individual walking around with an unlit cigarette dangling from his lips walking a bike and a dog. Guess that is still non smoking!!!
A single woman here would not feel secure.....<//review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<user_name>bethliechty6</user_name><rating>2< /rating><review>We have stayed at this location on multiple visits, and usually we have a very good experience with very kind and friendly staff. This trip was odd from the start - after some research we found out that this hotel has contracted with the city to house homeless during the pandemic. While I think we would have still stayed there if we had known beforehand, i felt the hotel was being deceitful on 3 separate occasions when we experienced some issues with noise and wanting to change rooms. The general vibe was sketchy which is unfortunate bc we’ve never had a bad experience prior to this visit. I think it’s a good thing that the hotel is helping out those in need especially during this pandemic,  but if the hotel had been upfront and open from the beginning i would have given it a much higher rating. Our rooms were clean and most of the staff were friendly...just be open with paying guests!< /review>< Time>

<review>Love it front desk is willing to help if but any  small issued had arise (mainly I had misplaced my room key) not only that it's also nice to have a pleasant comfortable place to stay I also want to mention housekeeping also polite and makes your room feel like home  if it's one night or if it's the weekend, in the middle of a week whatever arises or needs to extends....its accommodating,  Istaff were always willing to help were very friendly polite, very pleasant (I've stayed at some hotels were the staff were just out right rude hotel management didn't give two......) Nice to stay at a hotel were customer service still matters.
Plenty of parking:
Shopping:
safeway ,rite aid & staples+ are less then a mile.
if wanted  there is a path you can use to walk or bike very easily  ,Starbucks, IHOP, KFC,  Chevon +  are no more then a block and are also easily accessible walking or driving.
Nice quiet neighborhood..
Downtown is no more then 1 1/2 miles not sure exact distents but are two very easily accessible by driving or walking and if wanted biking...
Bike path:
When in Davis if you don't already know there will be a bike path within a short distance from wherever you are. The bike path from the Laquinta starts about 1 mile from the motel on  Research Ln same street as la Quinta.  it's a ucd campus route that'll lead you through the U. C. Davis Arbuim (collective of trees plants from around the world) goes to downtown davis and through the campus of the University of Davis and onward.
La Quinta is the perfect location going any direction to your destination along with staff who's kind positive accommodating , can't have such a better place to stay...
Well that's my opinion... Thanks😊</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

The outside parking lot had numerous cars parked in it that all look like people were living in them. The parking lot was filthy. I observed someone screaming at someone in a room through an outside window directly next to the main entrance. There was a pile of old broken bicycles by the bicycle rack,  I didn't bother to go in. I just left and called for a refund. My recommendation is to find a different place to stay.< /Review>

<Review>DO NOT STAY HERE! Apparently they are housing the homeless here due to the virus, but they do not inform you of that when you call to reserve a room. There is no consideration to paying guests and it does not feel safe. People are using drugs in the parking lot, drugged out people are wandering the halls and the lobby, it's just all around an unsafe environment. The police were here last night looking for someone. We are in such a beautiful area, but the hotel itself is gross and scary.

So our first room we had the king sized for a pet friendly room. We started getting out stuff into the room after a LONG day of travel only to find ALL of the bed linens had long, curly, black hair all over it and the head board was gross. [ mind you my husband has short black hair and so does one of my cats while I have medium blonde hair and our other cat has long orange hair ]. I was just appalled especially during the covid that is still going on. We were moved to a different room and it was ok. The linens at least ‘seemed’ clean but the room didn’t seem to have been cleaned very well. It was late so not much I could do to fix it at that point but I would just not recommend staying here at all.<//Text>

The rooms were clean and the hotel was just the right size... not a gigantic mega franchise but small enough to make the breakfast not seem overly crowded. The staff were very professional and old photos of Davis in the lobby were a classy touch. Kudos for the all you can eat fresh fruit, and all you can drink fresh ice water and coffee. Breakfast covered all the basics, even oatmeal which was delicious. Only setback was that the elevator was out of service twice but it was repaired by the time we checked out, and was not a big hassle when it was out of commission since the property is only two stories tall plus the ground floor. Keep in mind that if you require a copy of your receipt/folio at checkout then you should book directly with La Quinta. Overall a very pleasant experience during our week-long stay.</review>

Positive: It was a hotel in Davis. Negative: Off the top of my head, the entire hotel smelled like cigarettes and weed, the room had stains on the wall and the carpet was ripping, there was a volume limit on the tv, the police showed up outside for a while, the family next door was arguing loudly< /review>

Once I walked in th lounge it smelled like cigarettes.

The hallways were a bit small and the floor was dirty with also a smell. right when I got into the room I noticed trash on the floor but everything else was OK. will not recommend</review>

Positive: The staff was great! Had some unexpected car trouble the day of check-in and sadly could not arrive til after 2am. I phoned ahead and spoke to the front desk. When we arrived he had everything printed and ready for us to sign. Great customer service!! Negative: The halls and room were a bit stuffy. Opened a window and all was okay. Sadly my AC stopped working on day 3 of our stay. However, the front desk had us moved to a new room in just under an hour so that was great!</Text>

<text>The staff was friendly but for the price, I was disappoimted in the condition of the property; I expected more. The room smelled musty and had mold growing on ceiling of bathroom. The freeway noise was noticeable. The elevator looks old. It needs an update. Id have been better off to save $ and just stay at Motel 6. In the same price category, Country Inn & Suites in Dixon is a better choice.</text>< gmapID>

My boyfriend and I called specifically to find out if there was a hot tub at this location they should have mentioned the hours of operation because this is the reason why we stay here. Not able to use the hot tub until after 10, also the plug in the bathroom is broke, so I couldn't soak in the tub either..

The staff have been kind and polite. Any time I had an issue they were quite helpful and prompt with a solution. The toilet was messy, but the rest of my room was clean. The lobby, dining room, and other common areas were also kept tidy. There's an Applebee's conveniently located within walking distance. Overall, my experience has been very satisfactory.< /text>

<review>Nice hotel just off the highway & close to UC Davis, Sacramento, etc. Room was spacious and clean.  Bathroom did not have a fan but was otherwise fine.  Breakfast was ok, nothing special.  Staff was very friendly.  This was our second time staying here and will likely stay again when visiting the area.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Warm reception when checking in. The location is right off the freeway and in a quiet area. It is next to a delicious chinese restaurant. The room that we were given was very clean.</review>

Our room just closed to the high way, Terrible smell and huge noises, we couldn’t sleep well. During the checked in, I already asked for a clean and quiet room, but still gave me so terrible room. I felt so disappointed. Never live there again.<//text>

Came back at 3 PM to find our bed wasn't made and that there was no housekeeping staff on site to correct the problem.  No offer of a different room or discount ("the manager isn't here until tomorrow").<//review>

Comfortable stay. Older property but just fine. Clean room and bathroom. Small fridge, microwave, coffee machine. Decent size room. Breakfast was very ordinary though. That was not satisfactory but rest all was nice.

Place right next to freeway so there is quite a bit of road noise so keep that in mind if that bothers you.<//Text>

<text>La Qunita has been (and may or not remain) my go-to hotel when I travel to Davis several times a year for work. Its been good enough for the price that I havent wanted to try to experiment with other hotels as of yet. This time, however, the shower backed up several inches and the front desk said there was no maintenance staff available to fix it. I suggested a toilet plunger could do a quick job of clearing the blockage (assuming it was a small one), but she didnt have access to one (seriously? Its a hotel!), but her co-worker who started his shift at 11pm might be able to get it. I worked on my laptop past midnight, but he never called back and I had to crash, so the next morning it was a 3-deep funk-water shower again. Not cool.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

The hotel was decent. They breakfast was ok, with the waffle station being the best. A bit larger selection like bacon and potatoes would be nice. During check in, we were told cribs are not available, despite having called the hotel twice before our arrival to confirm they had cribs. Luckily the person checking us in doible checked and contacted his manager even though it was late and was able to locate a crib. The room was comfortable. The bed was nice and a great selection of channels in the room. Will stay here again the next time we are in Davis.<//Review>

Room was a little small but the bed was firm and comfortable, had a number of pillows of differing firmness to cover everyone's needs, and the channel selection for the TV kept even my grumpy kids happy. Also, this was the fastest internet I saw during my cross country trip, which was a welcome surprise.</Text>< pics>

Hallway a/c was broken on the 3rd floor where our room was. It was easily 110 degrees on the walk from the lift to our blessedly air-conditioned room.

Fixtures were old, rust on bathroom fixtures. Shower wailed horribly. They have a pool. We didn't stay for breakfast.</review>

< Review>
We were in a total of three rooms over two nights. The first room we were assigned smelled badly of mildew so we went and requested a different room. The next room had a moldy smell but they were out of rooms so we weren't able to change until the next day. The third room was fine but it would have been nice to not have to deal with the first two.</Review>

<Text>Cheaper than the other hotels in the area, courteous and helpful staff, clean room and facilities, free wireless, and no problems with noise other than occasional barking dogs which are well-muffled by the walls. Yep, this place is dog-friendly, which I actually appreciate in a hotel! They seem to be hiring lots of new staff lately, with trainees shadowing more senior staff, but that has not created any problems with service at all. Breakfast is somewhat minimal - no meats and nothing hot other than DIY waffles (which, admittedly, are quite tasty). Multiple restaurants and a convenience store within walking distance.< /Text></record>

<Text>Reserved a king suite so we could have a seperate sleeping area for our kids. Website started that the room had a *seperate* living room. There is nothing that seperates the "living area" from the "bed area". The pull out couch and bed are three feet apart. Also, I should have called ahead to confirm, but they do not offer cribs at all.< /Text>< user>

<review>We were visiting to take our daughter to UC Davis law school. Our overall stay was very comfortable. ALL the staff were pleasant and professional. I agree with another poster that the queen beds may not be actual queen size but we were comfortable. We had a problem with the TV in that some stations were locked but the front desk was able to assist us immediately. Although we had a microwave in our room, I would suggest including a microwave in the breakfast area to warm the pastries. It may be time to update some things like kleenex containers in bathrooms, mirror frames (they appeared rusted). I feel certain we will stay at this location again.< /review>< username>

<Review>TERRIBLE!!!  A group of kids who are staying for a tour of the college are staying directly above me and having a pool party. One after another, I get to listen to them run back and forth from the room to the pool and back. The manager put a sign up at the desk that said he was away. Calling the desk from my room does nothing. Calling the outside line with a cell does, but all I get is excuses and that the kids and their chauffeurs have been spoken to.  I would never ever stay here again or recommend anybody else does that would like to get some sleep.</Review></record></dataset><record>

I would give this hotel 0 stars solely because of the vulgar cat calling manager (tall black guy with a beard). Every time I walked by the front desk to go outside he made inappropriate comments and when I confronted him and requested the contact for the general manager he refused to give it to me. Do not stay at this hotel especially if you are a woman traveling alone.</Text>

<review>This place was great! I had to stay there during a business trip, so when I got back to the hotel, I was exhausted. The bed was comfortable, the air was chilly (great!), and we had Direct TV!

The blinds are a bit weird, as in you can't draw the thick blinds across the whole window. Expect a lot of light. Also, don't get naked in front of the window. When i stepped out for a smoke, I realized that folks could probably see me through my window LOL!

If you need white noise to fall asleep, bring a fan. The AC's fan doesn't run outside of the AC's cycle. so there was a lot of silence.

The continental breakfast was great. They had boiled eggs, which impressed me. Usually these free breakfasts don't have any source of protein, but this one did. Had a good selection of cereal, muffins, fruits, and other things.

The best for me was that I left my laptop there after checking out. DOH! When I came back to get it, they had actually plugged it in and charged it for me! I'm was so impressed by this! I used the full charge during the day too, so I was very thankful.

Great stay, great folks, great deal. Would stay again.</review><Gmap_id>0x808529701b618117:0x8fe4cab42e48b51a< /Gmap_id>< user_name>

Fair across the board. Definitely needs a significant refresh of their facilities, rooms (extra for bathrooms), wireless and breakfast. Overpriced considering all of the other hotels in town as well as the market. It wouldn't hurt for their staff to get some training as well.</Review>

<Name>Eyal Givon<//Name><Date>1621875278197< /Date><Rating>1</Rating><Text>Very disappointing. Sticky floors in the room and bathroom and a very noisy bathroom fan. Although we checked in very early - 3PM, the hotel was unable to provide anyone to clean the floors and take care of the bathroom fan noise, not they had another room we could switch to. This was allegedly going to be reported to the manager to resolve in the morning, but the manager was still not available when we checked out around 9AM. We did get a $20 discount, but this did not really compensate for the experience. After a 6 hours drive, we did not have the energy, or time, to switch to a different hotel. We can not recommend this facility.< /Text>< pictures>

{'time': 1621881653264, 'text': 'Hi Eyal, thank you for your feedback. We need to hear our guests perspective so we can address any deficiencies. We will certainly look into the problems you experienced. A sticky floor is unacceptable by any standards. Unfortunately we are restricted to the number of rooms physically available and if we are sold out, as we were on the evening of your stay, switching is simply not an option.'}</resp>

The staff were extremely knowledgeable, personable, and very helpful. They kept me informed of the progress of the work on my vehicle every step of the way. They kept me updated as additional items were identified and interacted with the insurance company directly on my behalf. The customer service providers was exceptional!<//review>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>I will be taking my car to them hopefully this following Monday but I just wanted to say that they have excellent customer service. I spoke with Maria about the damages to my car and she quickly came outside to review it. I'm going through with the insurance so if anyone wants to know, yes they work with insurances. I will edit this once the car is repaired to show before and after pictures of my vehicle.
Edit: So this is the update, I just wanna give a huge thanks to Network Autobody for repairing my vehicle, new trunk and bumper, bumper cover and impact bar. The paint came out even better than factory! Thank you to the staff for such great communication and an easy process, shout out to the people I had contact with: Maria, Anthony, Fabian, Erik and Ernie. Best customer service ever!<//Review>< Pics>

<Name>Nadia L</Name><Response>None</Response><review>These people are sociopathic cheaters and crooks. DO NOT trust them with your vehicle!

They picked up my brand new Jeep for body repairs after it was smashed into while it was parked. I had already been told by a previous shop the frame was bent and the insurance was going to claim it a total loss but I decided to get a second opinion (I loved this Jeep) and “lo and behold” when Network Auto Body (NAB) got a hold of it, suddenly, it’s fine, just needs 13k in body and paint work which, of course the insurance was covering in full.

2 months later when I went to pick up the vehicle (they didn’t even offer me a ride, those cheapskates) I looked at the underbody and the bumper was on crooked!

I immediately asked why the staff started to obviously panic and say they had to call the manager, Richard, who was not available, blah, blah, blah…

When he finally appeared since I started a scene, he back paddled really fast and said the car wasn’t ready yet and I shouldn’t have been notified that it was.

A few days later, I again was called to pick up the car, I again looked under the body and although much less, the bumper was still crooked. I knew what was happening and I started the accusations flying “YOU FIXED MY CAR ON A CROOKED FRAME!”

Yup, in fact they did and, they knew it, and they had not a glitch of conscience about giving it back to me that way, regardless of how dangerous this might be.

Of course, I took the car back to the original mechanic and contacted the Bureau of Automotive repair who wrote a lengthy report on how they “admittedly made a mistake, ooops”. NAB offered to pay me $250 for the mistaken frame report as long as I was willing to sign a waiver I wouldn’t sue them.

The worst part of all; THEY PUT A STACK OF WASHERS ON ONE SIDE OF THE BUMPER, TRYING TO EVEN IT OUT SO I WOULDN’T NOTICE THE STILL BENT FRAME!!!!!!!!! (see picture)

Turns out, many shops do this deceptive and crooked practice because they fear the insurance company declaring the car a total loss if the frame is in fact bent and then they lose the job.

Besides this travesty of an act, they were rude and careless. The paint had lint in it and the soft top was scratched and damaged from sitting in the shop unprotected.

I DO NOT RECOMMENT THIS BODY SHOP EVER, RUN!!!!</review>< user_id>

Erik and Ernie were awesome. They kept me informed of the status of my car as well as the process in regards to my auto insurance. Network Body Shop did an excellent job on my car, it looks brand new. When picking up my car everything went smoothly. The front office was professional and friendly and handled everything quickly.< /text>

<Review>They do a decent job except that they really need to get it right when it comes to planning. I took my Sportage for a not so big damage in the rear bumper and surrounding area. They said two weeks but they took almost two months. And, on the financial side, they kept sending revisions to the original estimate, really annoying and risky. Terrible. They definitely need to retrain management or change them. The negative impact on the customer is huge. I would definitely not take my car there again, absolutely would not refer them to anyone.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2c80c8bdb917b:0xce5aad1b5ddf11dd< /Gmap_id></record>

<text>Could not say enough good things about these guys. I brought my car in because of vandalism damage and they took care of everything with the insurance. Literally no hassle. Gave me a sweet rental car that I had for three weeks. When I came back to return my rental car, they even fixed my girlfriends bumper for free. 4/5 stars if I could.</text><username>Carol M.

The resulting bodywork they did on my 2019 KIA SUV was amazing! I know my car wasn’t old but the damaged parts of the body were real so when I went to pick it up I thought they gave me a new car!! It was a really well done job!<//Review>

Of course you never want to take your car for repair but when you do, you hope to have honest and reliable service.Network Auto Body (Downtown Los Angeles) was a great customer experience. Fran at the front desk is very good at guiding you through the process. Marvin and Dave were great for providing details of work required on your car. Everyone is also very nice and timely. I needed my car back within 4 days for a trip and they delivered as promised. The repair work was like new and the pricing was fair. I would highly recommend Network Auto Body (Downtown Los Angeles) they are customer focused and trustworthy.<//Review>

<Review>This company is a bunch of crooks. Brought my Landrover to them after they quoted $3k. Upon opening car, they quoted $11k for repair of two 2” dents from being rear ended. When I pointed out the absurdity, they yelled at me, said I owed them $2k for the quote assembly effort, and charged me for 11 nights parking at $125 per night. Their execs were squirrelly and demanded payment via cash or wire transfer cause they knew they were behaving badly. Hence, this review, my only way to have them known for the scam artists they are.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<review>Few days back my car was brutally damaged in a road accident and got many bents and scratches. I went to this Auto Body Shop for my car repair. As it was in a very bad condition so I thought it may take few days for overall repair and clean-up process. But Network Auto Body people were able to sort out it in couple of days only. It was quite impressive and they also addressed all my concerns and were quite helpful thought out the process.
Their overall repairing services were quite satisfying and I could see my car in a much better condition now. Just loved their quick and affordable services. Highly recommended!</review>< Pics>

Awesome Service! My car looks GORG!! Had all of the third party's insurance details, took care of everything. Offered to call over for my rental to pick me up (I walked, enterprise is practically up the block). Even received email and text updates on where they were in the progress of my repair. Convenient hours. Couldn't have really asked for an easier process!</Text>

<Text>Last week I met with an accident in which my Audi Q5 had a major collision with SUV. The collision was so bad that my car's bonnet & bumper both got totally damaged. I called up my brother and he took my car to Network Auto Body shop as it was the nearest one to us. We both were highly impressed with professional and affordable services at auto body shop. Their collision repair services were quite quick and praiseworthy.  Very satisfied!!!< /Text></record>

< review>
Last year I purchased second hand Audi Q5 from one of my friend. I used the car for like 7 months and then thought of getting it repainted so I took my car to Network Auto Body shop as I have heard much about this auto body shop in Los Angeles. They painted my car and gave it an overall brand new look. I was quite happy with their services. I would definitely recommend this shop to the ones who are looking for affordable and professional car paint shops.<//review>

Last week I took one of my friend's car for some urgent work and unfortunately had a collision with another car on the same day. The car got damaged with few dents. As this auto body shop was the nearest so I went here for the repair. They repaired the bike in 3 hours. I returned the car to my friend next morning and he didn't even get to know what happened to his car! What a great relief I got after returning his car as it was before. Thanks to Network auto body shop.  it's worth paying them!<//review>

<text>wish i could give 0 star. Do not bring your car here if you want quick and reliable service.
what I disliked.
1. I brought my car in for service at 11/6. They said it will take 8~10 business days. I ended up getting my car today on 11/28. They said it was due to the additional charge they had to collect from the insurance. Insurance sent out e-check on 11/23 and sent confirmation. Nonetheless, they held on to the car for 5 more days.

2. Now the car is back, it has the warning light on for tire pressure. Before bringing the car in, there was nothing wrong with tire, as I had only got the tire checked and rotated just several weeks ago. They could have at least given me a notice about it and ask me if i wanted to get it checked at. They apparently don't give much care about the quality of service as I would expect after paying thousands of dollars to them.<//text><Response>None</Response>< user_id>

Jack and the whole team made by car repairs a dream! Someone keyed the entire side of my car, right after I got it! I was super bummed until I drove into the Network Auto Body (Downtown Los Angeles)
I literally dropped off the car and voila...brand new car.
These guys are professional to the max!

Thanks guys!!< /Review>

I've been taking my cars to Network Auto Body for years. Most recently I took in my brand new BMW after I was rear ended. They make the process so easy and stress free. I was worried about how the color would match but it came out perfectly. Their staff and manager have always been super professional and informative. I will keep coming back for sure.< /Review>

< review>
I would give this place negative stars.  They are crooks and totally take advantage of people.  My Toyota was hit by a guy who ran a red light.  Insurance found the guy who hit me to be 100% at fault.  Toyota of Hollywood suggested I take my car to Network Auto Body.  Network Auto Body took advantage of my situation and they urged me to sign repair paperwork before the insurance adjuster came.  I was stupid enough to sign and authorized (I own my stupidity, but I live in LA and I was desperate to have my car back!).  In the end insurance refused to pay for the full bill because they said Network over priced it, and Network refused to release my car until the bill was paid in full.  I ended up having to pay $3000.00 out of pocket for an accident that was 0% my fault.  Obviously I made the mistake of listening to Network, but it proved they are not trust worthy.  Once the car was released my GPS wasn't working because the CD was stolen.  Network refused to take responsibility (of course; absolutely no way it could be their fault right?), but they were the only ones who had the car.  Super sketchy place.  Don't waste your time with them.</review>

This place uses your car for what who knows mean while your thinking its being repaired. They damage your car and have no shame in denying it! Would never recommend anyone to bring their car here! I totally regret it I only came here because my dealership recommended me here but never again!!!!!
They're full of it when you walk in its all nice talk after all they do is give you the run around....<//text>

I must admit I am one of the most difficult customers to work with. When a brand new vehicle is involved in an accident you can imagine how concerned one could potentially be. Network auto body and their team has addressed all of my concerns throughout the process, and is dealing with multiple insurance companies involved as well (a lot of work and people to keep up to date).Thank you ANTHONY for being patient with me through everything, JC for going through what work is to be done on my car, and THOMAS for being my Infiniti representative!  I am so happy to be doing business with Network auto body!<//text>

<Review>the most CRIMINAL OPERATION I've ever heard of. Insurance company requests an estimate due to an accident. Then decides they don't have enough money to cover any damages. Network Auto Body never once mentioned $100 per day lot fees and is demanding $3,000 just to return the car with no repairs done. The owner and his employees are criminals</Review>< user>

Horrible customer service ! I've been waiting a whole month for my car. And they keep promising it will be done following week, and always lie and tell me it's not ready.. (mind you it only had a tiny dent) I am very irritated because I need my car for work.< /review>

They receive great service, always professional and caring. We get reminders for boosters,, teeth cleaning and other routine care which I appreciate. The doctor is always thorough and explains procedure well.. I am also so happy with the groomers, our dogs are cut once a month with a bath follow up 2 weeks later. We have also boarded our dogs there.  This is a full service facility and I highly recommend.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Our wait time was short. The staff is very profesional and courteous. The annual exam was very complete. One concern/question that I had about my dog  was immediately addressed. I received very prompt follow up contact directly from our vet, Dr. Tom, via text, voice mail and email because I was at a location. where I couldn't answer my phone. She is a good listener and communicator. I also received my own copy of all lab results for my review. I appreciate that, and I appreciate all the staff at Singing Hills.</Text>

<response>None<//response><review>A MUST READ! If I could give no stars, but one will suffice. Unfortunately I have to write a terrible review on Dr. Tom. We experienced negligence on her end, actually most would consider malpractice as you'll read in the series of events we had with her. Our first encounter with her was because we moved & thought her clinic was closer to us as well as her high ratings. I'm not sure if she owns the practice but she most likely does because we had purchased a years' worth of unlimited office visits ($100), every time we went in there was always something that needed to be done. It started with X-rays because one of our dogs experienced some kind of pain & would cry a bit when we picked him up & then we did routine bloodwork. So there was some kind of Arthritis & then he was diagnosed with hypothyroidism, medications for life was prescribed. He wasn't getting better & proceeded with more tests including a lyme Disease test (we are located on the west coast & it's pretty rare here & more prominent on the east coast) turns out to negative of course. He lost weight so we went back because he wasn't eating much so again with the sales of special food but no explanation on the weight loss. We yet again come back & was asked if we wanted to do acupuncture therapy along with surgery for his now torn cruciate (her cost 2500). We decided to wait & recheck with a specialist aka a orthopedic surgeon (3000 which I'm confused on her price as she is not board Certified orthopedic surgeon to be charging that much vs the board certified orthopedic surgeon's price which his made sense) & we went back to our original vet. The 2 vets which includes the orthopedic surgeon looked at his bloodwork that I forgot to mention we did 3 times with her in a span of 5 months. They were so confused on why he was on hypothyroidism pills (we also lowered his dosage before me went in to see the doctors because of the dramatic weight loss which would fraction out to be low dose that it wasn't even working at that point meaning the new blood test & the old ones with basically translated to he didn't need it at all) So we threw the bottle out & he regained his weight & appetite. Now we are dealing with his leg issues elsewhere & when I had called to confront her about the issues & her constantly trying to sell us things she didn't know what to say! Nor did she even really remember us, I understand Vets see a lot of patients but we did not feel welcomed or special at all here. So with all of that being summarized I would absolutely not recommend this veterinarian hospital.</review>< Rating>

My dog has been treated well there, Dr Appel, Dr Tom, and vet tech Erin have been really great. But there are 2 main things that would make me think twice about going back again.

1. Occasionally I'll call in and speak with a specific person who is ALWAYS argumentative and rude and treats like everything I have to say is a fight. This person is always difficult to speak with because they speak over me where I can't even finish my sentences. (You probably know who it is.)

2. The price of medication can be grossly overpriced. I understand they're a small business and I wouldn't expect them to price match if they are to make a profit, but I checked prices of a few locations and they're grossly up-charging more than 1000% on one of my dogs pills. ONE THOUSAND PERCENT, you read that right.
Example:
500mg Cephalexin 84 capsules @ Singing Hills Vet charged $170.62
500mg Cephalexin 84 capsules on Chewy.com costs $16.80

So while I do like the clinic and I feel that my dog is very cared for, I do feel like they're taking advantage of worried pet parents. When I called in to ask for literally anything to make up for the cost, it was such a big argument to even get my point across. Hell, they could have thrown in a free dog treat and just said "sorry!" but instead it was just excuses and quite frankly they were extremely rude.< /review>

<text>Been looking for honest and affordable vets for a while now and I have finally found. The doctors are honest on what your pet genuinely needs and doesn’t need. Their prices are SO much cheaper compared to every other vet I have tried. Efficient and so sweet. Willing to answer any questions.<//text><Rating>5</Rating>< resp>

I have nothing but praise for Dr. Evelyn and the wonderful staff at Singing Hills Animal Hospital. My poor Yoda has a collapsing trachea, and sounded like he was trying to hack a lung out each night. Dr. Evelyn is a brilliant diagnostician, and never gave up. She tracked down the cause of the terrible rattle in his chest, treated it, and has given Yoda back a quality of life that i feared he would never experience again. Now we are both sleeping much better at night, and Yoda is regaining his pep. and cheerful outlook on life.

I really feared I would have to put Yoda to sleep. He was so miserable, and his illness was so resistant to treatment.  But Dr. Tom never gave up, and everyone at Singing Hills Animal Hospital was so supportive, always taking the time to make sure I understood all of our options, and had everything I needed. They worked with me to attack the problem with both medical and herbal treatments, and finally found a way to relieve that terrible cough and chest rattle. I cannot thank them enough for this  most precious of gifts, more time with my baby boy.<//review>

<Review>SHAH has been our veterinary hospital for many years.  Our entire family has relied on them.  They are so compassionate in their care, and when the "Sad" times happen, and we all know they do,  they handle the situation with the most grace and heartfelt concern.  I am so grateful for SHAH!  They are the best and I look forward to many more years together.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

They were able to fit my dog in for an appointment on the same day I called when his normal vet was booked up and was no longer taking walk-ins. They also entered him as a new patient easily with a copy of his license/medical records and little to no effort on my part. A vet then quickly and efficiently assessed our needs, brought us an estimate,  and treated him in just around a hour of our appointment time. They were patient, kind, and thorough with the follow up information too. We were then able to schedule his next appointment while at the office. I really appreciated the whole experience and look forward to a happy and healed dog thanks to them!< /review>

I am very pleased to be a new customer to Singing Hills Animal Hospital. My beagle became suddenly sick and I could not get an appointment with my regular vet and a friend recommended Singing Hills and they were able to see us on the same day I called.  They accurately and quickly diagnosed her illness and were incredibly communicative and responsive.  My sweet Scout is now on the mend and this is where I will take my dogs from now on!</Review>

I appreciate that Dr. Appel and all of the staff are warm, friendly, and knowledgeable. They always place the pet’s well-being first.  When I was stressed about getting my dog in, and still getting to work on time, they accommodated my schedule and took excellent care of my dog in the meantime. They explained what he needed, the home care I should provide, and made certain that I understood how to proceed. This has been my experience every time, over the past several years. Thank you.</review>

Started taking my maltipoo here almost a year ago and I found them on yelp. I got an appointment the same day when I called. The second time I took her, they made her appointment for shots and grooming the same day. Maggie, she was awesome and gave Coco the cut I wanted for my baby. Everyone is super friendly and will definitely keep coming back as it’s near my school. They are keeping every measure to ensure our safety! Thank you!< /review>

I'm really happy with the service we got here today. We took our older kitty here when we found a bump on his side. Dr. Evelyn Tom was the doctor we seen. She was very kind, very knowledgeable, an I feel I can trust her. My cat does not let anyone touch him. Literally freaks out if you get up to fast type of cat. He let Dr. Tom pick him up and hold him. Then as she was doing her exam he just laid there which is super rare for him. She went into details about his condition and found a underlaying dental issue. We got their $499 dental plan which lets you take any other of the pets in the house hold for free check ups for the whole year. He got a blood test and urine test an we were on our way. Dr. Tom was explaining what type of medications they use when they do dental cleanings an was describing the surgical  interventions. I knew from my own experience that she was being up front with us because I'm a surgical technologist and worked on people before and understood the use of ketamines and other medications an The Whole under laying procedure. I'm happy with the care we received and will be back.< /Text>

We have been taking our dogs here for years and everyone has been wonderful.  They have helped us during our dogs younger years and into their senior years.  I can't speak highly enough about the care and support we have received here.</review>

Very compassionate.  We recently had to euthanize an 18 year old cat and they did it with dignity.  They have a room (with lots of tissue) to wait in.  They came in and sat with us and explained the procedure.  My wife left the room and they gave the cat a sedative.  Why? I've done this before and the other vets just jab them and it's over.  The sedative made him go to sleep and I held him for 5 minutes.  Then when he was out, they shaved his paw for the final injection.  I finally found out that's so they can guarantee a vein.  I never knew that.  Quality business.<//text>

Was VERY happy with the visit, the staff and the doctor. They were so nice and so helpful with my boy when he got so sick. They did everything that was the best for him. I recently took in a young female that was abandoned. We set up for her to get spayed & wanted to proceed with the prep for it, but turned out she was ALREADY pregnant!! They did a great job checking her out, getting her blood work and making sure she was healthy, I don't think she had ever had that done before she was left alone to fend for herself. They took great care of her & now that she has had the puppies, we will be taking them in for their check up and then their shots as soon as they can have them so they STAY healthy. THE BEST veterinary office I have gone to after trying a few that were NOT so great. They are great with all my fur family, they are so affectionate and sweet with my "kids" & really interested in their health and doing it the best way for YOU. When I lost my cat to a sudden event they all signed & sent a card with such nice comments & were really kind & caring. They had him cremated & had a box made for him & other really nice things to remember him. I recommend Singing Hills Vet Center to anyone I know that needs someone for their fur family!</review>

<username>Chris Aguilar</username><review>So far so good. I have had good information provided to me from the first call. I am a first time breeder of a hunting dog and was in need of someone that could handle my questions about the breeding process. They not only had the expertise but the professional skill set to deliver. (no pun intended) They have handled all appointments with speed and professionalism. I would recommend their services to anyone.<//review>< date>

<text>We were looking to have Winter ❄️, our 10 month old husky spayed but were discouraged when we called the various veterinarians near us. The prices seemed pretty high and it seemed as though they didn’t have the level of service that I’d expect when it comes to care and procedures being performed on my dog who has been such a help to me as I currently have a major health condition of my own.

The timing must have been right as Winter ❄️ was currently being trained by Chris Lauttner who is AMAZING and his opinions are highly valued by my wife and me. He didn’t hesitate to recommend Singing Hills Animal Hospital. When I called I received the level of service I had expected and their pricing was a lot more in line with what are able to afford.

I went ahead and scheduled an appointment. Feeling good about getting something accomplished I should have known that good feeling wouldn’t last long as my wife had found a worm in her stool. At least I was prepared, I called Singing Hills Animal Hospital and scheduled an appointment for that same day.

When we arrived for the appointment I was very pleased with the cleanliness of the facility as well as the friendliness of the staff. The initial assessment, which I later learned was performed by the owner of the hospital, took a lot of time to discuss not just the issue at hand but everything else involved with her. It was very reassuring to know we were giving her the best food, that her grooming was perfect given Huskies and their well known shedding issues.

We left feeling pleased with how the entire experience went which helped us feel confident in her upcoming spaying procedure. I’d like to personally thank the owner for her time working with Winter ❄️ and us as well as Chris Lauttner who is the person you need to call with your dog training needs. As for Singing Hills Animal Hospital, I’m confident they will continue to exceed our expectations. Even with 4 vets within 2 miles of our home we will gladly make the trip because from our experience they are well worth it!< /text>< Pics>

Any place that takes care of my big baby Holly*My St. Bernard * has my backing. Dr. David Appel is taking care of her while Dr. Tom is out if tiwn6 because she has an ear infection and a rash . This place takes extra good care of her and I'm glad we found this place recommend by our trainer Chris from Lorenzo Dog Trainer.<//Text>

They have given me SO much informative information on my puppy, have explained everything thoroughly (things I have NEVER known with any other dog/cat I've owned) and have treated us so kindly.  Our puppy is completely covered now and right on schedule with her shots and procedures.  Even started dog training last weekend in the Singing Hills parking lot.  We love it and will use them from now on.<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>We had to make the most difficult choice today,  when we knew it was the right thing to do I asked the doctor if  we could go outside for a cigarette.  The doctor said to my friend and I no problem and suggested that we could take his baby out under the tree and do the hard part under the tree.   The Dr allowed us time together and perform the procedure in the open air.  We are sitting here talking about our loss and hope that in our last day on earth that we have that wonderful doctor that did such a fine job on such a difficult day.  The staff was incredible god bless each and everyone who helped us today<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

The best animal hospital. Dr. Tom and her team make you feel very welcome with your fur babies. They comfort you when needed and answer your questions so you understand.  Dr. Tom actually sits on the floor talking to you and your fur babies. She makes everyone at ease. My Lil guys prance into the vet because they love everyone there and are not afraid. I board my Lil ones their with comfort knowing they are cared for.  A brand new boarding building is being built,this year. Yay!!<//text>

Dog trash have a ruptured intestine. The doctor took him in an emergency situation and did surgery without any regard to payment. Her only concern was  the health and safety of the animal.  This is an awesome hospital with awesome staff. I highly recommend them. Thank you singing hills animal hospital.<//Text>

I was looking for a new vet and heard some good things from acquaintances about Singing Hills Animal Hospital. I have four rescued dogs and I noticed a lump on my Dixie/poo Mia. We saw Dr. Apell. He took the time to explain what it could or could not be. I had a feeling that he truly cared for the animals and their owners who walked in the door. The place seemed clean and safe. But I still was not sure if this was the place for me and my babies.
Then Teddy my Heinz 57 guy had an episode which I thought was a seizure. I had an appointment the same day I called and saw Dr. Spell again. He took the time to answer my questions and removed my fears.
That day I then decided that they will be our Animal Hospital.
All our visits were very positive and informative. I felt very comfortable there. I even told a friend about them.<//Text>

<review>Years ago I used this veterinarian hospital,  but changed because of the bad care for my pregnant dog & moody rude receptionist.
She was not due for awhile.
She'd slipped & hit her belly & was passing a dark green discharge.
I was told it was nothing to worry about.
Later she goes into labor & 4 of the 10 pups at dead.

The receptionist at the time was one of the Dr's. daughter.
She was always in a bad mood & let you know.
I stopped going there.
There are too many veterinarian's available to put up with that witch!

It's too as Dr. Edward was nice.
He is not the vet that miss judged my dogs problem.<//review>< Date>

Dr. Tom and her staff are wonderful.  We started going to Singing Hills in 1999, and have been going to this veterinary clinic with our pets ever since.  Three dogs later we wouldn't go anywhere else.  Our pets have always had excellent care, and  Dr. Tom will call and discuss your pet's health concerns with you at any time. This means a lot  when your pet means a lot to you.<//Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Absolutely one of the best places I have ever taken one of my pets.  I went in because my vet was not available.  My Labrador had been sick since the evening before and needed to be seen.  The staff was amazing and throughout the day I kept in contact with them as our situation progressed.  Because of their care and direction my puppy is alive and well.  He had to undergo emergency surgery to remove a blockage.  They assisted me in getting him diagnosed and to a facility that performed the surgery and the 24 hour care he needed.  I will be forever grateful.  I have a new vet now!

<Review>4 stars because out of 5 visits, only 1 was bad. The people helping in the front are always friendly - helpful and organized! I waited in a room once for over an hour (I guess   they had trouble communicating with the ER who had originally seen my pup to get info) but I could have been in the lobby or re-scheduled.

Overall, friendly people and good prices.< /Review><UserId.>102917845458816814150<//UserId.>< Resp>

<text>DON'T GO HERE. I'll tell you why. They overcharge you and don't give a **** about your feelings or your wallet. There's a nice veterinarian in lakeside that doesn't overcharge you like this place does. His name is Salvador Flores. Go there!!<//text>< user_name>

<Review>Dr. Apel is THE BEST!!! Always listens and trusts that you KNOW your pet better than anyone. He always explains all of the options available, then gives his opinion, then allows you to do what is best for your pet. Dr. Apel always has a plan of action that he explains at every step. His calm, confident and knowledgeable demeanor always calms this nervous Momma whenever something is amiss with her babies.
The staff is efficient and always pleasant.
The office is clean and welcoming.
I would recommend anyone looking for a place to care for your babies as you do...
Singing Hills is THE BEST!!!

Thank you Dr. Apel and thank you Singing Hills staff!!!

Dr. Tom has been treating all our dogs for several years. We are very happy with her services and with the entire friendly staff at Singing Hills Animal Hospital. Our dogs are generally very healthy, and Dr. Tom helps keep them that way. We highly recommend her for her excellent skills as a veterinarian, her attentiveness to our animals and the comprehensive and caring way she explains everything to us as dog owners.<//Review>

This has been on of the best vets I have ever used, saved one of my dogs life's that had a severe immune attack on its nervous system and red blood cells.  She has been great with a dog we adopted from Mexico and my hunting dog with her knowledge on some farm diseases I was unaware of and are not "normal" vaccinations.

I woke up one Saturday morning  and noticed our puppy Thor was showing signs of illness, my wife 8 year old son and 16 year old daughter were pretty upset.I called Singing Hills Animal Hospital and explained the symptoms to them , they advised me of what I could do until I got the puppy to them, they opened up the schedule and were able to fit me in same day, Thor made a full recovery!!Their service deserves a 5 Star Review.What sets them apart from other places is the fact that Dr Tom and her entire staff not only care for the animals they are treating they also take the time to care for the feelings of the individuals and families bring in their pets for medical care.< /review>

I am very impressed by the Drs and staff at Singing Hills Vetenairy hospital. They are concerned for your pet and your pocketbook.They have very reasonable packages which allow free future visits. They ask you about what you want done in regard to raising your bill too high. They explain what needs to be done now and what can wait.
They are CareCredit vets which means they pay the interest on your account for you for a limited time when costs are above your current resources. They have holistic recommendations for some ailments. I highly recommend them for your vet, grooming and boarding needs.</review>

All I needed were some antibiotics for a cold or sinus infection for my cat and before I knew it, they wanted to put her under general anesthesia to do a dental exam, order labs, do an ear cytology with ear flush, etc...A brain CT scan was even mentioned....No wonder people don't like taking their pets to the vet.....going a bit overboard as usual.....<//Review>

I took my 12 yr old Lab They were recommended by my large animal vet ! They wanted 849$ to do exam and X-rays. This was about a week ago. Could not talk to vet except by phone... was not allowed to enter office so we sat outside! Assistant said they could not find a heartbeat ! And pulse and heart are not the same. BS Dr Kibbee and Paula came to house and took care of her! RIP Snickers<//Text>

Excellent coffee, munchies and service. In addition to having a great alpine sort of cozy atmosphere to the little A-frame cabin and surrounding garden. Nice little coffee shop.</Review>

Cinnamon rolls are cold and not worth the price they sale them at.  Personal opinion coffee wasn't like the old owners made it.</Text>

<text>The place was so homey, I almost cried when I walked in, because I just moved from across the country for school.
It was absolutely beautiful, and the service was fast and friendly, with AMAZING apple cider, (I would know 😂 I drank most of the cider they gave us. My poor classmates didn't get very much) delicious and beautifully presented food, and simply all around great service.<//text></record>

<response>None<//response><text>Adorable place. Historic house converted to a NICE, LOCAL coffee shop that has a big shady, outdoor patio; cozy indoor seating areas; great prices and drive-thru window service. Best of all, it is located next to the local post office (USPS) - for real convenience. One block away from noisy Main Street Hwy 299</text>< pics>

<Text>Would highly recommend!  I called ahead to see if they scheduled appointments but they did not so I took a chance and went in during the week in the afternoon and I was in and out within 20 minutes!

<review>This place is a little hole in the wall, but definitely worth your time. The service was extremely efficient and professional. I was in and out of there within 20 mins. They had a television and a water dispenser, but no restroom that I had noticed.
If you're a local, I suggest checking out their Groupon advertisement. I got a smoking deal with the additional discount. In short if you wanna save some time and green, go and check em out. I'll definitely be coming back.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>Fast, friendly and professional service. I was on my break from work and was able to get in and get my car smogged right away. Their establishment is clean and it’s located in an easily accessible spot. I will definitely return when it’s time to for my annual renewal.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

<Text>I have been coming here for YEARS! Fast service, good price for a smog check and HONEST. With a family of 4 cars, that is a lot of smog checks I have to do. There are some pretty shady smog check businesses around, I had an old Honda Civic that I had purchased from a big name dealer locally, the car was due for a smog check a couple years later and I brought it here. The gentleman that helped me said the car didn't pass visual inspection because the exhaust manifold that is an integral part of the  catalytic converter had been repaired and he is unable to perform the smog check legally. I had mentioned the car was like this when I purchased it, he said the care should have not been legally sold in this condition. I replace the cat and intake manifold, brought it back and it passed no problem.< /Text><Time>1605455533086</Time></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Being 68 years old, I was not thrilled that my car needed a smog check considering Covid-19.. However, Temecula Smog was clean, it felt safe, the employees were properly using PPE gear and I was able to get my car Checked in 13 minutes. I will be only getting my cars tested from here on out.< /Review>

I have 87 Toyota pickup 22R carb that needed a smog but front desk employee notice that there is no check engine light on the cluster. The truck don't have one with this model and want me to get it fix before smog. Their tech guys should know this !!!! Took my truck somewhere else & passed no questions asked.

A bad experience from this employee!<//text>

No place compares to Temecula smog. If your looking for a smog test center that’s not only reliable, quick, efficient, honest, and treats you like family look no further. I have a few older Porsche’s and corvettes that sadly need smog checks and there’s no other place I trust but Temecula smog.</Review>

Buyer Beware with this smog center! Horrible service! Took my van from the dealer next door, service tag on keys. Told the employee the car was just serviced. He took my keys then told me it didn’t pass smog because it was just serviced! I TOLD him that before handing over the keys.
He charged me $52 bucks knowing that it would not pass due to service minutes before.
This is unacceptable in my world. He acknowledged I told him it was just serviced and the keys had the service tag still attached.
Thanks for taking my money! Never going back.<//review>

< review>
I wouldn't recommend this place.  I took in my 2000 stock Camaro and the guy helping me by the name of Joshua tells me one thing and then another.    First he said I had a cut that needed to be welded in front of Catalytic Converter.  That I could weld myself,but then he tells me the pipes are different sizes and that it looks tampered with?   It has the original stock pipes!  Car has always been garaged.  Anyhow, then he tells me to drive 50miles so the OBD2 could reset, when I start to ask him questions, he tells me to go drive 100 miles!  He was unprofessional, dude might as well told me to take a hike.   It seemed like he didn't like me to question him in front of his homies.    I just know I'm never going back there again.</review>

<Review>UPDATE: Spoke to both the manager and district manager regarding a not so favorable experience I had at their shop. They apologized, offered to refund my smog cost, and assured me my experience was not the norm. I appreciate the time they took to call me and with their explanation I now understand why couldn't follow through on a request I made.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Recommended!  Fast considering there were 3 cars in front of me.  Roughly 50 minutes.  Enough time to walk down the street to grab lunch and walk back.  Cheapest I could find.</review>

the technician and the owner really know what they are doing and make this the fastest, most affordable,smog check there is. i was scared to try a new smog shop but they made me feel as if i knew them for ages. Recommend them for the easiest smog process out there!< /Review>

<review>We went to Temecula Smog this morning to have our vehicle smogged for registration. The staff was extremely helpful and it took less than 30 minutes to complete. We walked across the street to grab a cup of coffee, and by the time we got back, our car was ready to go! Thanks again Temecula Smog. We will be recommending you to our friends and family.<//review>< pics>

<text>Could have told me it would fail visual inspection in the first minute. Instead he wasted 40 minutes of my time, charged me for the test and then tried to charge me for an additional evaporative test when he already knew he would fail it! Just what you expect with these guys, 0 customer service skills.< /text>< time>

Update***10/22/18.. So I needed another smog check and of course I came back here even better service than last time same guy I dealt with last time also I believe he is the owner or manager... Super chill super efficient and super cheap...

Normally I don't read reviews just look at star Rating. Good thing I read the ONE BAD review ... 100% FALSE REVIEW... I HIGHLY RECOMMEND This shop and Feel they should be defended against the bad review 1 person has posted negatively. I also like that the Owners posted on here in defense on there great honest Smog Test Only shop!!!!<//review>

I went there today to get a smog done on my Toyota Corolla. I went to two other shops and one shop was to busy the other one wasn't a star station. I called because it was getting close to closing. He answered the phone and said he wasn't busy and that he would wait for me. Once I got there he greeted me at the counter and took me in. I was in and out in no time. Great customer service.< /text>

Therefore we cannot be the place you are speaking of, you are probably speaking of a place that does smog near or next to us.

<review>I love this place. I've been going to this restaurant since it was located off Lakewood Blvd and Stewart & Gray. The food is amazing and the seasoning is unique. I love their Super Deluxe Burrito De Carne Azada in Green Sauce. It's huge and the prices are very reasonable. Their fajita plates are also amazing.

It is a family owned restaurant so the ambiance is very personable. Love this place and I haven't had anything that even comes close to it.< /review>< pics>

Great Mexican food  - family owned and operated. The food is fresh and delicious. The only minus here is the table tops, which are all slightly sticky. It's not dirty, it's the finish that's wearing off. But the food is great! Try the  #4!< /text>

First off, it’s hot as heck. No air conditioning whatsoever. The many fans they have just circulate warm stuffy air throughout the place. Secondly, the tables are beyond sticky. Sticky, sticky material the napkins stay stuck. You have to rip them up to pick them up. I ordered the green enchiladas. I thought, “simple enough. You can’t really mess that up too much.” Bland. Not only did it lack flavor, but also sauce. They were pretty dry.. the rice that was included tasted & had the consistency of reheated old rice. Needless to say, i won’t be going back.<//review>

Absolutely delicious. I had the shredded beef burrito plate with red sauce. The beef was so flavorful and just the right amount of spicy. Sauce is always iffy for me, but this sauce delivered. Highly recommend.<//text>

<Resp>None</Resp><review>Great "little" Mexican food restaurant in town. The best wet burritos around! Their red sauce that they use for many plates is delicious. Their assortment of salsas are tasty & vary in the level of spiciness. They can get crowded at times, but in my opinion is totally worth it. I've been coming here for many years & have never been disappointed. Highly recommend!</review>< Pics>

< Review>
The food is great.  For the most part,  the staff is great as well with the exception of one of the waiters.  He's the older gentlemen with glasses.  It seems like he's in a bad mood all the time,  no customer service manners.  Everyone else is great.< /Review>

<rating>2< /rating><text>Went their for dinner a few months back. The place was not so busy so i expected to be seated fairly quickly. Not the case. They just kept walking by us as if we were not even there. And when they did see us, it looked like they did not even care. 2 servers at the bar talking smack about some of the customers and who knows what else. We decided to leave and swore never to return to a place that is so disrespectful to their customers. I will not recommend this place to anyone I know.

Very dissappointed< /text></record>

All of a sudden they can't take cards?  Last time i was here got here at 30 min before they closed and told me it's take out only. Nvr had that happen. Been coming to The Downey location for more 20 yrs maybe 25 years. Last few times coming here has been bad. Don't even eat. Like I said. Food is amazing.

Food decent, service was terrible. Don't expect to be greeted with a smile. Waiter was somewhat rude, my wife had to walk up to the kitchen and ask a cook for her drink. Go somewhere else, street tacos stands give better service.< /Review>

the food is good "comida casera". I was not disappointed with the food or the service at all. In my opinion, you can tell alot about a Mexican restaurant by how good the beens are and the beans, Mexican style rice and sauces were delicious. I ordered the carne asada tampiqueña, hubby ordered the wet burrito in red sauce, my son ordered the green chile enchiladas and my daughter ordered the kids chicken tacos. I had a taste of everything and all of it was tasty and well made. The portions are HUGE too. all around, it was a good dining experience.< /text>

<Review>I've been going here for years food is good but after last night doubt ill ever go back rude man (server) took a cake for my nephew since we went to celebrate his birthday and the man said you didn't bring any plates? Or utensils? Seriously!? Brought all my sodas full of ice and no soda... and gets mad if you ask for more tosatadas and only brings like 3 at a time! Never  came to ask if everything was ok and had to get up to ask for everything we needed! Hell yeah i didn't tip! Seriously! No more marisa's for me & my family i cant go eat somewhere where people seem to hate their job!< /Review>< time>

<Name>Nadine Fiala</Name><review>Was very disappointed in the food.  My friend and I both ordered cheese enchilada, taco and ref ride beans.  The taco was sitting in the sauce from the enchilada and was so soggy on the one side you had to eat the inside with a fork, no way to pick it up.  We thought the prices were a little high for the quality of the food plus you order it at a counter no waitress or waiter.  We agreed we will not go back.</review><Date>1495929151513< /Date><resp>None< /resp></record>

Huge portions, however since this isn't an "assembly line" fast food Mexican restaurant,  do expect to wait for your food a little bit, while they prepare it.<//Review>

<Text>Decreased rating from 5 to 4 stars on 3/22/2021. In 2020, I heard some noises of an >200kV AC electric generator running in some Sundays, everything else is OK. The elevator never stops between the platform and the concourse level since there is a button between it (possibly halfway between the concourse and platform levels).</Text>< Pictures>

Soon to be on the National Register of Historic Places, this grotesque brutalist monstrosity occupies space that could be be use for homes and shops. Perhaps they are listing it as an awful warning to architects to do better next time.<//review>

<rating>3</rating><Text>If it's convenient for you you'll use it, and if not not.  Inside bike parking, though not enough of it -- usually full by 9AM.  Bathrooms are open and passable by public toilet standards.  Some jockeying with corporate shuttle buses required, since Google, Yahoo, Genentech and others all run buses through here, and it's a congested intersection prone to aggressive driver stupidity where left turns are involved.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

I ordered fresh bread and they gave me loaves off day old, frozen bread. I contacted Customer Service and they said since this is an independently owned location they can't control how they do business and they could not contact the owner or resolve the issue. Even the customer service representative thought it was odd. I was over charged $1.50 for each loaf and the issue was never resolved.< /Text>

Good location. If I was still a childless adult, this would be a 5 star rating. As that is no longer the case, it is now 4 star, here's why. We have a six month old baby. The tables can fit 6 people, however, the depth between seat back and table are very narrow even without holding a somewhat squirmy child. Also the metal pole under the table bruised the knees of both my husband and father in law entering the seating area, both are about 5'11". There are 2 alternate seating areas as options (two round tables in the back, or what looks like a wheelchair accessible bar at the front, both with moveable chairs.
We've come to this location 3 times now, good experience each time. Open promptly. Friendly, knowledgeable staff that could help us decipher between the best Italian options. Great customer service which goes a long way with us. Good salt n vinegar chips. Restroom is clean and stocked. Downside is there is no  baby changing station. There is a wheelchair ramp for the sidewalk in front of the store, with rail. Two wheelchair accessible spots directly in front, and multiple others.< /Review>

We love Jimmy Johns, more flavor than other sandwich places and the bread so soft! We first had it in Las Vegas and we were hooked. This is honestly better than subway and Jersey Mikes if you like more flavor.</Text>

The sandwich is delicious.  The bread is thinner than other similar establishments.  Overall, a smaller sandwich as well.  This particular location seemed friendly and well run.</Review>

Requires you to download an app to your phone,  outside and order your food that way. Too complicated. Drove down to the Corona location where you can order inside with a mask on and take it to go.</Review>

Jimmy John's is not that good. For all of the commercials you think it would be better. However, the portions are small and it is pretty expensive. I had the turkey club I think and like I said it was a pretty small portion. It was good quality, but for what I was paying, I would have liked more. I won't be back.< /review>

Sand which didn’t taste fresh. Staff weren’t too kind either. I’d rather goto Jersey Mike’s or subway. Not trying this place again.< /text>

First, the music is way too loud and a complete distraction for an eating experience.  Hearing AC/DC wailing away at "Back in Black" is not conducive to a decent dining experience.  Turn the music OFF.

Second, I don't want to see the "potty humor" all over your bathroom depicting various scenes of urination and defecation.  Completely unnecessary, stupid and, again, not conducive to any sort of dining experience.

Third, I don't want to hear your staff whining (to me and other staff) that an employee left and that they're swamped. Yes, the restaurant was busy, but only because it was the dinner hour.

Fourth, I know you are too busy to answer the phone, but does your phone have to be so loud that it's heard over the entire restaurant?  AC/DC interrupted by a loud, constantly ringing phone that apparently doesn't have message or mute capability.  Sheesh.  I changed my "for here" order to "to go" because I couldn't stand the blaring noise in the restaurant.  You're going to make your employees and customers deaf!

The sandwich was okay, but skimpy.

I actually went here for the 1st time because I SUPPORT legal hunting, but I won't be coming back again.  I'll be hunting for a different sandwich shop.<//Text>

No sub should come with mayo unless asked for!! Learn from Jersey Mike’s they have the perfect sub line and everything goes smooth get on that level of customer service and get some better bread choices I’ll come back in 6 months and give a better review if things change overall never going here again<//review>

Poor quality bread, tomatoes were over ripened, very bland sandwich only put the slightest of drizzle of oil & vinegar on italian original sub. Delivery fee is based per item so the more you order the more they charge to bring it to you. I gave them a try and it was a huge disappointment much prefer Jersey Mike's or even Subway.<//review>

< Review>
Easy to find,  indoor dining 🍽room and patio seating,  chips and salsa for a starter,  bar and cold beer 🍺.  Daily specials and easy to figure out menu. Prices are reasonable and service was good and friendly staff. The restaurant is colorful and full of ornaments and trinkets .4 stars only due to the flavor of the food was little off 😋< /Review>

Amazing food and super friendly staff. I loved how they all work together to get customers what they need. The mole enchiladas were incredible. They are slightly spicy, but not too much. The chips and salsa are real tasty here. The margaritas are good without being too much they used a spicy salt for the rim too. It was great! They have a huge outdoor dining area. We had zero complaints!<//text>

Great Dining Experience!  1st dine-in restaurant meal in California in 6 months! The owner & her staff were very friendly and accommodating. The food was fresh hot & had that home-made taste! Great Mexican food!  Will be back!</Review>

The food was just OK, but the service was absolutely terrible in every way. There were two servers, neither one cared or paid any attention to us. I had to get up and get my own fork, after asking the waiter 3 times. No water refill, no "how's everything?" nothing! We left without finishing our lunch.< /Text>

< review>
A bit disappointed.  Service wasn't as we would've expected.  Served iced tea without ice, took awhile to get food and waitress never checked on us.  Food was 50% good.  Chicken tacos were delicious but the chicken quesidilla wasn't very good.  Many people have food allergies or can't eat certain foods.  It would've been a good idea to let is know that the quesidilla  would be served on top of sour cream.  We used to really enjoy this place when in Davis and was really disappointed this trip.</review>

Good food, great location, nice décor and layout of restaurant but SOME not ALL of the staff here seem to have an attitude, operate in some bitterness, mild hostility, haste and annoyance.  If any management is reading this I suggest y'all take a look at this. Almost every time I've been in there for sit down or to go orders I notice this stressed out, irritable look or vibe from the manager, bartenders and waiters faces. This is pre and post mid-pandemic.  I feel unwanted when I walk in there, pay for an order. Just today I was greeted by the bartender as I walked in to pick up my order with semi-hostile attitude trying to cover it up with a "light" tone of voice. The host seemed so pressed and pained by the nuances of his shift Everyday isn't a bad day Tres Hermanos. I've worked in customer service and stepping that up a little more can go along way.  I'm human after all and can be very wrong. I don't know the day you guys have and don't want to come of as mean spirited but I took to this review to support you guys because in fact I really do like this restaurant and always recommend it to tourist or my colleagues and customers!</text>

First time here, suggested by co-workers. It did not disappoint! It was SO good! We are picky about our mexican food. We are always searching for authentic Mexican food. If it was closer to us, we would definitely be eating here at least once a week!

We had the tacos and enchiladas. The portion size of the tacos were bigger than expected, which I am not complaining at all. We ended up having lunch for the next day.

On top of the food being delicious, the staff there are super nice! 5 more stars just for them!<//text>

The food is good. And, they have a huge patio with lots of outdoor seating. And lots of space heaters. Fortunately they have lowered the volume of the Mexican music. Which makes dining a pleasant experience.< /review>

This was our first time here and it was refreshing to eat out at a place with a cozy outdoor atmosphere (good social distancing), delicious food, and have a good time out with our daughters. The staff was excellent. All wore masks, restrooms were available and all doors had foot openers.  The plates were huge and we were served plenty of food.
The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because of some flies and a bee. I noticed some centerpiece fans on some of the tables to keep flies away (what a great idea!)
Anyway, we can't wait to go back and eat there again!</Review>

A very nice outdoor experience, the staff was awesome. The food quality was top notch, and the portions were just right. Waiting time is very long, but totally worth it. A must if your around Davis. Try the beef fajitas, completely delicious.< /text>

Had a great night out with the wife.  Had a very tasty Jamaica-rita it's with salt of course!  Chips were Soo good and the salsa had a great picante bite!  Good heat!  Debated on a combo or the awesome chicken mole.  Got the best of both worlds with the chile rellano combo with a chicken mole enchilada! Que sabrosa!  Highly recommended!  Great night out!</text>

<Review>Highly recommend this place for lunch!  Met my son for lunch on my way to home to Nevada. The service was fast and friendly. Chips were warm and the salsa was perfect amount of spiciness.
My son order the Carnitas chimichanga it looked delicious.  I ordered the special “vege chili relleno” it was amazing.
If you’re driving through Davis CA. I would highly recommend this restaurant.< /Review>< pictures>

Highly recommend this place! It was my first time there and my family and I loved it! Food was delicious, service was great, and the cleanliness was some of the best I’ve seen since restaurants have slowly started opening up. I’m already planning my next visit!</review>

Delicious mexican restaurant in Davis. This place has the best street tacos you have ever had, which goes fantastically with palomas on the side as well. If you want to chill, chat with a friend, have a drink and enjoy some authentic mexican food, you should definitely try tres hermanas food.</review>

Good food.. Exactly what you'd expect from a traditional Mexican restaurant.  I shared an enchilada meal and good rice and sauce plus they have whole beans which is a real plus.

Good value and service, especially since your in the middle of downtown Davis.< /review>

<review>Had the tamale and enchilada combo and it was super good. My friends who ate the carnitas and Al pastor said theirs were some of the best they'd eaten in a while. Overall, great food.</review>< Name>

What a great place to eat! I've yet to be disappointed when eating here. The atmosphere is great for a casual dining establishment,  the service is always better than average and the food is done well. The carnitas are crispy, the rice is flavorful (like a Puerto Rican style, much better than the bland rice most places have) the rellenos are well done, great soup and salad dressing, etc. Its not the greasy burrito place I love, but it's great for sit down mexican dinner.

I reccomend any night of the week.</review>

Highly recommend!  The mole enchiladas are a must! Fajitas are delicious, and the fresh salsa and guac leave you wanting more.  Buen Provecho!</text>

<Date>1568389940628</Date><Rating>1< /Rating><review>Unfortunately I have to give 1 star here because I had a bad experience. The place is nice and big, and the food is decent, although overpriced for the quality. Up to here I would have given 4 or 5 stars, because the environment and the terrace was very pleasant. However, first of all the service was extremely slow, even though the restaurant was not even half-full and there were at least 4-5 waiters/waitresses serving. Despite telling our waitress to hurry up because we had to leave soon, it took more than half an hour to serve 4 very simple dishes and more than 20 minutes to get my credit card back after paying. I actually had to go inside to retrieve my card because it was taking too long. But the worst part was that they deliberately manipulated the bill: I received a ticket missing the tips bottom part for a total including taxes of $66.54. Since I didn't want to add any tips for the huge delay in the service and was in a hurry I just signed that ticket and left. A few days later, to my surprise, I received a charge of $75.54 from this restaurant out of nowhere. I won't come here again, I have had similar food in other Mexican restaurants in Davis for a much lower price and without having been ripped off.< /review>< pictures>

Great food and wonderful service. If the weather is good, try to get seating outside. When the summer evening breeze kicks in, the patio is the prefect place to enjoy quiet conversation and good food.</review>

I realize that I arrived right as my table was ordering food and I took an extra 2 minutes to put my order in but I should not have had to wait an extra 25 minutes for my food. My entire table of 12 we're finished before my food was even started. I hope I will have a better experience next time, I do want the food again. The enchilada sauce was delicious.< /Text>< name>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Text>Tres Hermanas is an excellent restaurant. I frequently visit their Sacramento location, but decided to try this Davis location while returning from San Francisco. Firstly, the food was pretty consistent. I couldn't tell much of a difference compared to their Sacramento restaurant. Service, on the other hand, was just slightly off. We didn't have enough cutlery, plates were not supplied on time, and one dish in the order was not correct. This was easily overlooked once we dug in, so I would still recommend this location.</Text>< Pics>

Needless to say I enjoyed my salad more than the main dish, but I shall give them another try for something other than mole or enchiladas in the future.< /text>< name>

<text>I'm actually surprised that it wasn't better than what I've heard. I ordered the taquitos dinner, it came cold. Rice was hard like it sat under the warmer too long and my beans were dried out.  One of the members of my dinner party ordered his dinner without beans, there were beans on his plate. Plus, I saw our waitress doing shots with a customer 😐 Sad,  I was hoping for a  better experience.<//text>< Rate>

Food was excellent. The chicken rice soup is delicious. Service was a bit slow as they were busy for lunch.</text>

The food was good. The place was busy but not too loud. If you are a purist about such things you should tell them to leave the cheese off the refried beans.</Text>

The weather spring through fall is often very pleasant.  I love dining al fresco and Tes Hermanas has one of the biggest patios for dining.  The food good and plentiful.  The staff is small and worked very hard to serve us all.  More staff would have gotten a fifth star.< /review>

I come here as often as I can, and I always have a wonderful experience. The food is great and the staff are almost always super attentive, despite the fact this place tends to be pretty popular. I've come here many times, and I plan to come back many more.</Review>

Definitely a go to Mexican restaurant, if you're on the fence, just go! Their creamy cilantro salad dressing is perfection, and they have a solid selection of vegan friendly choices as well as my personal favorite chicken tacos.</Text>

One of the better resturants for Mexican food you will patron in Davis. Delicioso! Only drawback might be that the margaritas are slightly small for what you pay, but still very tasty.</Review>

<Rating>4</Rating><text>There really are no authentic Mexican restaurants in Davis, but I could honestly say that Tres Hermanas is very close to what the real thing tastes like. The service here is very spot in and the waitresses are really friendly. You could even practice your Spanish with them and be greeted with a smile. The food is very delicious and the atmosphere that is created really makes you feel at home. I would definitely recommend this place to whomever likes the taste of a good Mexican dish.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Every time we visit Davis we always stop at Tres Hermanas. Love their food. Their outside patio is usually pretty full with people enjoying food, drinks and entertainment.< /review>

Service started out good then faltered.  Chips are good.  Salsa is good.  Got the crab enchiladas.  Was hoping for real crab, but it was imitation.  If I had known it was imitation (menu says "grilled crab"), I would have ordered something else.  I will be back to try other menu items.</Review>

A good variety of vegetarian options including common menu choices for a vegetarian restaurant. The service was good & ambiance is casual. Street parking can be found.< /Text>

<review>Generally too much salt, in everything. Even found a hair in my guacamole... Overall the place needs a clean up, desperately. Don't use the bathroom. Might as well go to the UCD MU to get better food.< /review></record></dataset><record>

We  came during lunch and were told to sit where ever we wanted.  The servers seemed to be a bit overwelmed, and the table next to us was getting up to leave because no one helped them, when a server finally rushed over.  We were waited on after that, and our food came out in a reasonable time after we ordered.  While the food was good, I won't come back here for lunch again, because after waiting to order, and getting our food, our visit wound up taking about an hour and a half, which is way to long for a lunch visit.<//Review>< Pics>

Food is excellent. Staff could be a little more attentive...we had to get staff attention to get more napkins, boxes, and bill. No one came back to check on us after the food was delivered.< /Text>

<Review>Awesome place! This food was so good. Get the combos or happy hour. I had a crispy chicken taco and pork tamal it was so delicious. Comes with rice and beans and soup or salad. Soup was arroz con pollo so had to go with soup. Chips are freshly made. Also great drinks. We had the meals but they have some amazing happy hour deals too. And great, friendly service. Definitely have to come back.< /Review>< Pics>

Just got back from Tres.... and wow pleasantly surprised!  Great food, and good service.  I got a soda, chips & salsa, house salad, chili con carne all for $12!
the food tasted wonderful and was exactly what I expected.  The salad and salsa were fresh, and the service was good *thanks to server Michelle =) and the two other people for keeping my glass full! my food was served nice and hot with plenty on my plate.  I recommend this place for a good lunch on the patio, i haven't tried the drinks but it gives me another reason to come back.< /review>

Bad experience. Refills never came, my margarita was poorly made, our server disappeared for 20 minutes, and once I got the bill I had to wait an additional 10 minutes to close it. Will not return.<//text>

<Rate>3<//Rate><review>I thought the food was nothing special and it was a bit over priced for a carne asada burrito. It was just too plain and too simple for what you’re paying  when you can get the same thing somewhere else for almost half the price to justify the quality. Other than that the servers were pretty good but I wouldn’t recomend this place to grab some lunch while you’re off the clock from your work shift, this place is more suited for going on a date or taking your family out to eat. Over all,  it was a hit and miss for me and maybe I picked the wrong item, but how can you go wrong with a burrito?< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Took the short drive to downtown Davis from Sacramento today and had lunch with my wife. We elected to sit outside on the patio and enjoy the nice breeze under the shade of trees and umbrellas. Warm chips and salsa arrived quickly as did our ice tea. Plenty of selections available as we scanned the menu and sighted the Amtrack station across the street. My wife had the tostada bowl chicken salad and I chose the  huevous with steak and refried beans. Food was seasoned perfectly and was quite flavorful. Good sized portions and our ice teas were refilled promptly.  A large fountain outside the entrance kept passersby parents and children interested, as they stopped to walk across the intersection. We received excellent food and service, despite there being a large baby shower party on the patio as well. We definitely plan to return and I strongly recommend you visit Tres Hermanas in Davis and experience this for yourself.<//Review>

<Review>Some of the best mexican food in Davis.  If you are looking for a lite lunch, try a crispy chicken taco. The chimichanga is enough for two meals. The chips and salsa are excellent.<//Review>< Name>

Decent-ish Mexican food. Nothing to write home about. If you get caught here late on a weekend, watch out! It evolves into an obnoxious night club (loud people, music, and expensive drinks.)< /review>

The wait was too long and the staff seemed inexperienced and a little slow, but the food is fantastic!  If you're not in a hurry, totally worth the wait!< /Review>

The food was awful. Then I notified my server the food was inedible and she offers to have it remade. I informed her I didn’t have time to wait so she brings me my check 20 minutes later! And I had to pay for the food I could even eat. I use to go to the one in downtown sac. But the food started getting terrible. Thought I would try this one. I’m done. 1 star only because they won’t let me  give less.<//review>

<review>Staff was kind but the food was definitely not worth a visit, nor were the margaritas.
Ceviche was served at below room temperature.
I passed many restaurants to get there, huge mistake.
Definitely need to clean patio, tables and restrooms.< /review>< pictures>
