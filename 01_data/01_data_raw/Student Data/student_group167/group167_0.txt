Excellent lox bagel, with capers, tomato, onion and cucumber, for very good ($6.50) price.    Great coffee (Guatemalan organic).

Beautiful corner store with lots of windows, on a "triangle" of streets.  Nice ambiance,  very relaxed.</text>

On the not too busy part of College. Parking on side streets. A space with lots of light as they use wisely the windows on the corner and a great alternative to chains coffee shops. They have also real sandwiches and nice bakery products. Cappuccino was awesome and also the 7 layers cake. we had also a very tasty signature sandwich- as half size option. Queue could be an issue, if you run out of time. I would return.< /review>

< Review>
My favorite East Bay cafes for working during lockdown - #1, Hudson Bay

One of the things I miss the most during lockdown is having a place to get coffee and work for a while – yes, I know I’m not alone there ;) So I’m going to share my very favorite places to work during lockdown – i.e., cafes that have a fair amount of outdoor seating (and preferably decent Wi-Fi coverage too). The Hudson Bay café was a fairly regular haunt for me during normal times, and during lockdown it’s running pretty well with lots of safety precautions: Perspex screens, sanitizer, and a window counter if you don’t want to walk inside. Staff members were super-friendly as usual and there’s always good music playing (it’s faint outside, so I could just barely hear The Smiths and The Weeknd drifting out through the side door).

One thing to note is that the prices are very reasonable – my veggie burrito cost an amazing $7 (or maybe $7.50) – and it had guac in there too! And it was big! I also had an oat milk latte and a slice of pound cake and the whole tab was around $14. For comparison, I paid the same amount at another place this week for a coffee, cookie and plain croissant.

Lockdown Stats:
•	Seating: There are about 6 tables outside and chances are reasonable that you’ll get a spot. If you’re stuck without a seat you can hang out on a bench outside the library across the street.
•	Bathroom: Another good thing about going to Hudson Bay to drink a lot of coffee – the bathroom is open! It’s surprising how many cafés have no bathroom availability after selling you a big old cup of diuretic!
•	Hours: Note that they close at 5 pm at the moment, not 6, but they’ll let you linger till maybe 5:30.
•	Weather: Hudson St. faces southwest, so it’s often pretty warm, even around closing time!
•	Budget: As mentioned above, Hudson Bay is one of the cheapest places around (esp. on College Ave.) to get lunch.

I’m also giving the Hudson Bay Café 4/5 “green stars” for social and environmental impact, based on this:
•	Very longstanding independent café and community gathering spot.
•	Coffee beans come from McLaughlin roasters in Emeryville - another East Bay staple.
•	Some of McLaughlin’s coffee varieties are organic and most are bought directly from cooperatives or family farms that support communities.
•	It kind of goes without saying that plant-based milks are available – and raw turbinado sugar too.
•	The menu is a bit more traditional but there are a few veggie and vegan options. I think they’ll also make veggie/vegan mods to a menu item, if you ask, since everything is cooked to order.
•	There’s not a lot of info available about Hudson Bay’s sourcing of ingredients – my feeling is that the owners want to keep things as unpretentious as possible. Since it’s lockdown I’m not going to bust their balls over it :D
•	Waste is minimized pretty well, even during lockdown when most places are loading on the plastic.

This cozy, easygoing cafe always has a friendly face behind the counter. There’s a small but satisfying breakfast/lunch menu plus the standard array of pastries, tea and coffee drinks. The BLT is a hit with my daughter. I opt for a bagel with cream cheese or as a breakfast sammie, though sometimes get a sugary morning bun.<//Review>

Came here for the first time today, so many positives it's hard to know where to begin. Service was friendly and helpful, the ambience is excellent with plenty of natural light. They have fast Wifi with many outlets, and lots of tables. The coffee and food menus are expansive, and very affordable! We all know coffee shops in oakland have been bleeding people dry with expensive prices, but this place is more than reasonable.

In a neighborhood with many options, highly consider making this your choice for coffee and food. Oh and they also have beer and wine if you're feeling that too :)</review>

Had horrible service here.

Ordered a simple bacon egg and cheese breakfast sandwich, with about 5 customers around - not busy, and no food orders ahead of me. 10 minutes later, an employee shows up to start making breakfast orders. He proceeds to start making orders for two other customers that had ordered after me. 20 minutes post order, he finishes his first sandwich, and I go up to remind them of my order. The two other employees at the front clearly notice my frustration. The guy literally snaps at me, asking what I ordered, while the girl cashier does nothing to acknowledge the long wait. 10 minutes later, I finally get my sandwich. No apology was ever given for the wait. Sandwich was ok I guess.</Text>

<response>{'time': 1559780774539, 'text': "Good afternoon Peter, I would like to apologize to you for your overall experience.  I had to find out what had happened before responding and your legitimate concern.  There is no excuse for the food person's behavior towards any of our valued customers and I have made sure that this type of behavior is not repeated.  The manager was trying to figure out why the orders were not printing in the back.  It turns out that we had a power outage to the cafe and as a result the point of sale system had shut down. Upon starting the point of sale system, it was not recognizing the printers or the other computer that it is supposed to connect to.  She was on the phone with tech support to try to resolve the issue and was concentrating on that issue not realizing that your order had not been relayed to the kitchen.  This is not an excuse for what happened today but I hope by giving you all the facts you would give us another try and we will make sure that you get the service and product that our customers have come to appreciate.  Again, sorry for a bad start to your day.\nBest wishes,\nSadri Madjlessi"}</response>< Gmap_id>

I recently moved in down the street from this place and wanted to give them a try. Great reviews, convenient location, that's a winning combination. I ordered two mochas and walked them back to my girlfriend back home. We tried them together and it was immediately apparent that the espresso had been seriously over-extracted. The drink was extremely bitter, and the chocolate was far too sweet. Oh well, I'll try them again tomorrow. Maybe the barista was new, or he was just having an off day.

I came again this morning to try their chai. Once again, I walked back home before trying it. My mistake. It tasted like watery soymilk with black pepper lightly sprinkled in. I wasn't expecting a traditional chai, but this second drink was completely undrinkable. If all of their drinks are this bad, I honestly don't know how they stay in business. Needless to say, I definitely won't be visiting again.

The one upside is that their service is very good. I was served quickly both times, and the staff is exceptionally friendly.</Review>

I asked if it would be a problem to get one of their sandwiches w/o cheese. They said it would not. They then made it with cheese and when I didn't accept it all - I get very sick if I eat cheese - they then blamed me and denied I had asked for no cheese. I sent the sandwich back a 2nd time at the urging of nearby patrons & my gf, and they said they'd make me a new one. But I waited 25 minutes and they never made another one. People who came in after I sent it back got their food orders before I asked for a refund.

They did give a refund, but I left incredibly hungry and sad that they were so disrespectful.</Text>

We love this place. They have great gluten-free breakfast choices with a dedicated toaster. Delicious espresso drinks, great service and great ambiance. By far, my family's favorite cafe.<//Text>

The coffee is good, the atmosphere is so comfy and casual and the service is genuinely friendly. They have places to actually sit and enjoy your coffee. It's totally local but not even close to hipster. One of my favs in Oak Town.<//Review>< rate>

I love this place.   Homey,  warm, gentle, and not at all corporate.   No one steams milk as well as Tanya.   These days half the barristas can't steam milk.   Hudson Bay has been around before coffee was so trendy.   No pretending here,  just good coffee &  good people.</Review>

<Review>This is a hard review to write because this cafe has wonderful products and good customer service. The problem is that they allow smokers to smoke at the outdoor tables. This was my regular cafe for many, many years but I finally had to give it up after my son developed asthma and I could chance exposing him. At times, you have to walk through a cloud of smoke to enter the place. I is such a bummer that the owner and managers do not enforce the law. Interestingly, a walk up and down College Ave. will reveal no other cafe with such a dense group of smokers (including employees). I guess the smokers who are willing so share their second hand smoke have found their haven.< /Review>< Pictures>

<resp>{'time': 1441296139912, 'text': 'Thank you for the review.  Since your concerns were brought to our attention, we have a posted more signs for customers not to smoke on the cafe premises and we ask everyone not to smoke around the cafe.  As you know, it is very hard to get everybody to comply but for the most part, our customers and staff try to adhere to this policy.  Thanks again for the review.\nBest wishes,\nSadri'}</resp>< GmapID>

<Time>1454563450717< /Time><Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Great atmosphere, lovely owners, good strong coffee in huge mugs, and great panini sandwiches. Plus it's right across from the library!

I'll plan a perfect day for you: go to the library when it opens at ten. Take fifteen minutes to find a book, maybe twenty. Go across the street to the HBC, get a gigantic cup of coffee and a pastry, and claim one of the loungers in the prow window. Maybe get a sandwich later. Read, take a break to watch the world go by, repeat. When you can sense the heavy jitters and caffeine psychosis coming on, head home.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>March 7, 2021 Sunday
Wash after 7 pm. I intended to load (1) in the $6.50 washer; 2 loads in the $4.50 washers. $4.50 washer area is small. You might say three is a crowd. The kid attendant was folding her wash and talking on the phone like it wasn’t already loud there.  Noise can be a factor when doing laundry and the area is tight. The carts is only 1 way in between the wash in the two middle floors. Social distance could of worked there but there was no set of rules to this effect. I also experienced the parking area is not suitable for disable parking. No play. I was washing (on a prior week) weighted blankets. I am not lifting a tee shirt. So loading three loads in there baskets and those baskets kept rolling away. Problem with that too! I can complain about the respect on that Sunday night the managers daughter proved she had no respect by cursing right back to repeat what was said. Who is it to her business to say you’re acting like children. I refuse to accept the explanation why she did not seem to be helpful? Elderly people have to help themselves to take care of there own wash too. I need to speak to Bill about these issues.9:54 pm 030921: T<//review>< Resp>

So easy and convenient! I walked in and asked the first person I saw about the laundry drop off service. She took me to the little scale that weighs your laundry to determine the price, I explained that everything I didn’t want put in the dryer was in a grocery bag. She gave me my laundry detergent, softener, and dryer sheet options, I paid, and I was on my way! Just picked up my clothes and I am very happy! Highly recommend. Just $17 for 10 lbs of clothes. What a great service. So convenient. So well folded.</review>

A little pricy but other than that, it's a great place. Staff is awesome and the machines are all newer. Sitting area closed due to COVID but plenty of shops around to go in while you wait.<//Review>

<Text>As someone traveling through the area, I had no previous experience with local laundry facilities. A quick Google search led me to U-City and quite possibly the best coin laundry experience I could have hoped for. The owner was on duty when I visited. With his natural customer service skills, he was very genuine with his willingness to assist me and answer any question I had. He offered "old school" service in a society that could certainly use more of it!

The machines were top quality and offered the technology that was efficient in both time and careful handling of my laundry (which included clothing, bedding, canvas and a sleeping bag). The dryers were amazingly fast minus the extreme temperatures often  found in commercial equipment. The prices are VERY reasonable, too. I found the entire business to be immaculate. The bathroom was spotless, as well.

If you frequent laundromats or just occasionally need one, do yourself a favor and visit the best in town.......U-City Coin Laundry. They take the term  "coin laundry" to a whole new  level of modern technology
. They are located in a shopping center along with other businesses you may need. Once you experience U-City Coin Laundry, you will leave with so much more than clean laundry.<//Text>< pics>

Nice & clean with newer machines that take both quarters & cards. Yes @ first I thought that the driers were a'lil overpriced ($2&$4) but @ that price it gives you 30mins. & actually drys the complete load "that was half jeans" the first time around. Great place< /text>

<text>Nice place, clean.  Accepts credit so no need for quarters.  Too bad they wont let you wash past 830 even though they close at 10.  I showed up at 833 and got sent home.   I would of only been an hour at most which leaves me 930/945.</text>< Gmap_id>

< review>
I have been to this laundromat several times and generally okay but tonight a dryer destroyed a comforter and blanket. There was a dark sticky discoloration on my bedding that ruined both. I hope that manager contacts me and I am compensated but not hopeful since voice message mailbox full.     Before you use any machine in a laundromat check to make sure it will not ruin your laundry! I put laundry in assuming all okay - but after burning smell and obvious discoloration, I later realized there  was a sticky substance in dryer that ruined bedding. The attendant was understanding but hoping management does right thing. Carefully check washers/dryers or your laundry is ruined!</review>

<response>{'time': 1572932239300, 'text': "Hi Susan\nThis occurred on Saturday night and I reached out to you Sunday morning.  I don't consider that an inordinate amount of time...  Further, You asked for $100 for the comforter.  I looked up the item on line and found out CostCo sold it for $24.99.  So what is up with that?  The damage you claimed was from a yellow sticky substance was actually damage from using High heat on a comforter that says to use delicate cycles.  I had offered you $25 because I was sympathetic.  I will still honor this even after your efforts to trash and extort me"}< /response>< GmapID>

<text>There twice. Very nice, good washers and dryers, bathroom on site, two entrances, bar type seating, outside seating, shops and eateries in same area, wheelchair accessible. Free parking, bathroom. A little pricey, $3 cool/cold wash $3.25 warm/hot. $2 gets you 30 min on dryers, but can add 25 cents as needed as long as dryer hasn't stopped. Also larger washers for increase charge, clean. As laundromats go, one of the nicer ones I've seen here.<//text></record></dataset><record>

I've only been to a handful of laundromats in my life, and they are usually terrible.  This place is not one of those!  It's clean, tidy, and has machines readily available.  People are polite and courteous.  I love the card payment system, it does charge your $20 up front, but when it clears your account it is only the amount you spent.  The location is great too, cause I  get a coffee while I'm washing my clothes, and do some grocery shopping while they are drying.  Makes my day so much more efficient and lot less stressful.< /text>

This place is really good. It has big clean washers and dryers both taking cards. There is a change though. Cleaning supplies can be also purchased here. The interior is clean, light, with comfortable seats and cool photos around. I always go here when I need to wash my big blankets.</Review>

<Review>Today I used the wash and fold service at U-City Coin Wash.  The service was great and my clothes were ready for pickup in just a couple of hours.  The clothes were all sorted and folded very nicely.  I’ve been to other wash and fold places that did not sort the clothes whatsoever making it time-consuming to put away the clothes.  But not here… all the “like” clothes were grouped together making it quick and easy to place them in their appropriate place at home.  The price was good – slightly more economical than other nearby wash and fold locations.   While I didn’t actually operate the washers or dryers – they all looked brand new.  The place was clean (almost immaculate).  The young gentleman that helped me was extremely courteous.  I will definitely go back to the U-City Coin Wash.</Review><UserId.>106280200317750033792</UserId.><time>1371239074588</time><Name>Annette Jarman< /Name>< Response>

<review>I appreciate this place having staff on duty at all times. They’re always friendly and accommodating. There is a counter top with magazines where you can actually hang out while waiting on your laundry and read or eat something. It has a bathroom as well. The machines are mostly clean, some of them more, others less, with hair stuck inside or detergent spills. It would be awesome if they checked on them more regularly. They have three or four 8-loads machines. A big plus are that you can pay with credit card.</review><Time>1519364348643<//Time><rate>4< /rate></record>

<text>This looks like one of the nicest laundromats  I have ever been too. Unfortunately the listed hours on here aren't exactly correct.  While they may be physically open until 10, their last load is at 830. I am in town on vacation and got there at 840. I didn't see the "last load time" and was halfway done loading the washer I was going to use, when the person working there told me about the last load time. He did tell me where another laundromat was, but that one was not up to my standards.</text>< username>

This is the best laundromat I have ever used, very clean, consistent, allows me to use credit cards for all purchases, and a free bathroom. Unfortunately, no paper towels in the bathroom, but that's the worst criticism I can make of this place. I wish they were open 24 hours but I can understand that's not very practical.</text>

Place is very clean, machines modern.   There's a nearby donut shop+Rite-Aid, etc in the strip mall.

Wash: $4
Dry: $1.25
Machines take ATM/credit-cards, coins.
Wifi works well, must get pwd from attendant.  Reasonable seating while waiting.<//Review>

<text>They get three stars b/c they did try to make it right...BUT
I took all my bedding there after family had been sick. I placed half my stuff in one of the big dryers. When checking how they were drying I found plastic/rubber debris in dryer and it smells funny. I told the attendant. He said, "oh yeah. I should have checked that. There was a bum with sketchy stuff in there"
!!??!!
So half my pillows and blankets smelled like cigarettes and just nasty stuff.
I was hoping after full drying it would air out. Nope. Called. Had to take them back. They worked on them for two days. When I picked them up it looked like my pillows had been dragged on the ground! Even the attendant was sheepish at that!
So probably NOT going back since I had to buy all new pillows and a new blanket. :/<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Rate>3< /Rate>< Gmap_id>

I was in there 2 days ago, they have signs posted that when you use a Debit Card they will process a charge of $20, but the true charges will be sent to the bank after 2 Hours.
It's now 2 days later, the $20 charge is still showing at my bank and to add insult, U-City Coin Wash answers their phone and then just hangs up on you.

Go somewhere else.< /text>

< review>
Due to COVID the customers can’t go inside . So We have sit in our car and call when here . This place is horrible . Their wait time to just answer the phone took 15 min and then when I was able to say I was here they made me wait 40 more minutes after I had an appointment. What are the appointments for. I feel management needs to make this a way , way , way smoother process if you are going do it this way in checking in .</review>

<text>These people are scam artists. I took my dog in and they suggested a x-ray because my dog had a heart murmur. I went ahead and did the x-ray and they said everything looked good. The following day they suggested doing another scan that would have cost me an additional $500 because of the heart murmur. I don't understand why I paid for an x-ray if this wasn't the way to check her heart to see if it is healthy. Also, why did they tell me everything was ok and then it probably isn't ok the next day? They like to charge for more tests to increase their income. SCAM ARTISTS!</text>< Pics>

I got my puppy neutered here. He had a quick surgery with clean incisions. They were fast, precise, highly informative and very kind. I look forward to continuing to use their services in the future. Would highly recommend.<//Text>

< Review>
I had an appointment for 04/08 . I have been searching and searching to get an appointment for my dog Konan for months and no luck . I called here and got an appointment the next day. All staff was really friendly and my appointment day went by quickly. They were patient with my pup as he is a nervous boy. It was overall a great experience. I will definitely be back. Made my day , out of all places I have been , I have never been treated with such kindness , even if it was small, but it was very much appreciated. Thank you!<//Review>

<review>Thank you so much Dr. Haver for all that you did for Miss Bella. She isn't the sweetest kitty with strangers. After a few months of x-rays, sedation with cast applied unfortunately we had to have her leg amputated. Sky Canyon staff and the Dr's truly are the very best in Riverside County.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCTdFZEw036CZB7n65qnBCVPjr7rtyHry_tUlc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><user_id>111087154415167457634< /user_id><GmapID>0x80db7e7653671221:0x9bdf373707a13a19< /GmapID><Response>None< /Response>< Date>

We had a great experience with vaccinations the other day. They came out to the car and got my dog right away, took her in and she was back with me in just a few minutes. The vaccines were affordable.< /Review>

Very friendly and communicative staff. I recently adopted a puppy and she needed her spay. They had availability right when I needed. Very informative of the steps that I needed to follow. And very thorough with at home instructions.< /review>

Friendly staff. Our Great Dane has no problem going in without us (since we're not allowed inside right now). Dr. called us by phone to discuss treatment then they brought her out with her medicine.< /text>

Brought my dog to what I thought was the Saturday vaccine clinic without an appointment, per your website's currently posted information. We only found out when we called to come inside that the clinic had been discontinued. It was an unnecessarily disappointing morning spent outside your office doors. If you don't offer the Saturday vaccine clinic, please update your website to reflect this. You've had more than enough time.<//Text>

< review>
I hate writing bad reviews but this is deserving of one in my opinion. We adopted our pup from a rescue who works with this vet so they are the one who did her spay instead of our regular vet. The spay was done in July and we have had issues with it ever since despite following all the post procedure protocols. Two appointments with our regular vet later she now has to have surgery because not only did they confirm nonabsorbable stiches were used as if they were absorbable but they think some foreign material was stitched inside. We should have known from the moment we picked her up since the surgery site looked like an intern with no experience had stitched her up. I have had to take multiple days off of work now and our poor pup has been through the ringer.</review>

The staff is friendly and the doctor is caring.  I was impressed that the doctor sat on the floor with my scared cat who was hiding under the table.  Rather than force my cat on the table, he stayed on the floor to do the exam where my cat was comfortable.  He was gentle and thorough.  This is a photo of my cat sleeping in his bed at home.< /text>

<review>This was my first and last time coming here. My appointment was at 4:30 I got here at 4:32 the first thing I did was call them that I was outside waiting but before I had the chance they told me to hold . After 6 minutes waiting they told me that i was late 10 minutes,  which I wasn't and I told her that i was on hold the hole time then she didn't say anything.  She came outside to get my paperwork never came back after 30 min .So I left and left my dogs paperwork behind.< /review>< Resp>

<Text>Great people, excellent service. I love how they explain everything to you.
On a side note, if you need a groomer;
The girls next door at Amazing Creations Pet Groomers (Heather and Jodie) are AMAZING!! I took my 2 big doggies, Zoey & Bailey, to the doctor first them to these ladies... the job they did on them was wonderful. I have never had my dogs groomed so well. Great smelling, super shiny, soft coat... No more shedding!! I will be using Sky Canyon Vet & Amazing Creations from here forward!< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOT6Gf_5sAXIUs-wUtWVL34D8n_fEtd8bAIaCed=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< resp>

<Text>This use to be my go to place for both my fur babies, but after my last visit with one of your rude and unprofessional vet techs, I won’t be back. This young lady wasn’t able to do simple subtraction on my change for the transaction, so I told her what the change should be, and I received major attitude for it.  She had the nerve to tell me that “she’s just a vet tech! Really young lady?  You certainly have to know how to do simple addition and subtraction to get by in life. It’s common sense. She was less than helpful with other requests I made and acted as if I was inconveniencing her. Never, ever again, especially when there’s other options that are better. I suggest making a change before your business is affected by it. No one needs that kind of attitude walking into a pet clinic.</Text>< resp>

The medicines they prescribed our senior dog gave him a stroke and eventually killed him. They didn’t even follow up whatsoever to check on him. This is the kind of services you can expect when you bring your loved one here. Always research side effects to the medicines they negligently prescribe your loved animal<//Review>

<text>So grateful to Dr Haver who went ABOVE & BEYOND to care for my grandma’s Yorkie, Pepper last week when she had horrible foxtails stuck in her fur. You’ve always taken such good care of a dog mom who’s absolutely NUTS about her pup! We live in WA & are too far away to help her out much but I did buy & send her the special metal combs Dr Haver recommended should poor Pepper get into foxtails at the dog park again. Thank you for giving up what sounded like your lunch break to help her out. You’re a total saint!

I'm a new customer and from my experience they are truly genuine animal care vets. I've been to a few places and trying to get care for a turtle isn't always the easiest to find. The doctor helped me to find the right care for my pet even though they could not do surgery there. I will take my pets there first next time. They are very compassionate and help anyway possible to care for your pet. I was not able to save my pet but they helped immensely. Thanks for your GREAT VETS and GREAT STAFF!!!< /Text>

Similar to other reviews, the medicines they prescribed caused more harm to our four legged family member than it did help. They do not follow up either , would not recommend anyone bring their loved one here for care< /text>

< Review>
We have been using Sky Canyon Animal Hospital since we adopted 3 dogs from the local shelter in 2015. One was a senior dog that had heart issues that needed constant medication. She was able to live a very comfortable life until late 2017 when we realized the medication was just not enough anymore. Very compassionate doctors, technicians, and office staff. As for the 2 other adopted chihuahuas, they needed spayed and neutered. After their procedures we were surprised how small the incisions were and that they didn't even need to wear a cone as they paid absolutely no attention to their stitches. If I remember there was only 1 or 2.   Very satisfied with everything.  Thanks!<//Review>

Very nice experience with Sky Canyon Animal Hospital. They are, I believe, the only clinic that will see reptiles, close to my home. We have a 1 year old Panther Chameleon, named, Pixel. He was in for a well check. Dr. Haver was very knowledgeable and the staff was also very nice. Prices are reasonable and the clinic was very clean. I was very impressed.< /text>

<review>Dr. Haver is awesome he answered our every question in detail. We are first time parents of a puppy and he was very knowledgeable and patient with us. At no point was our puppy scared he loved all of the staff and we we're taken care of very quickly. Pricing is great I thought we would have ended up paying more but pricing is very reasonable. Don't hesitate bringing your fur baby here, this is the place you want for your furever friend. I will be coming back here for our future needs.</review>< response>

New in the area and was referred to them by a neighbor. My dog got very sick and Bobbi was able to squeeze us in right away even though they had never seen us before and they saw us before our appointment time. The vet was knowledgeable and thorough. She also listened to what I had to say since I do know my dog best. Ultimately, they helped my pup get back to healthy without costing me an arm and leg. Bobbi is fantastic up front, all the other staff was super polite and professional. Extremely grateful for this group of animal people.< /Text>

I will only take my pets to DR H!! He is wonderful and does not try to run up the bill like other vets we have encountered. He only does what he feels in necessary and will be helpful. I feel he is honest and my pets love him! My dogs body language tells me everything I need to know! He gets down to their level and comforts them. He is not strictly business, he spends time talking to me and I am blown away by his memory!!!!!!!!!!!! He didn't even look at our file yet, all he saw was a pic of my dog and he remembered us, our situation, medical stuff and things I told him, meds my dog was on that were prescribed by our vet in a different country from a year prior!!!! This is a DR who sees thousands of pets a year and he remembered all that and in detail!!!!! Amazing DR and Person!!!! I highly recommend DR H! Thank you DR H for everything!!!!<//Review>

I really loved surfside and the front desk there was friendly, organized and alert of thier clients.
I have not had that same experience here unfortunately.
The first time I came in for the shot clinic. The front desk was not only unfriendly but very distracted and there was only myself and two other people there.
They didnt even acknowledge me when I was done they were playing with a puppy instead 2 of the front desk ladies and forgot to get payment. I didnt think about it till I got home.
Of course I paid them over the phone, but it was really unprofessional.
The second time I came in for my other dog, I brought him in for his vaccines as well and the nurse left the vaccine needle on the floor in the waiting room, thankfully I saw it and my 22 month old son didn't. I dont think these people here are as good as surfside, they seem rushed when clearly it looks empty, unorganized and flustered/mad, I really like the Vet/Owner Gary and thats why I gave 3 stars, but this has been an issue for me and now a safety issue too.< /text>

It's obvious Dr. Gary Haver loves animals. It shows in his every action. He's not afraid to get on the ground at eye level with your pet so they're at ease with him and, just as importantly, he's not afraid to explain things to you so you're more at ease with all the medical jargon. His staff is friendly and kind as well, not afraid to show their pleasure in their jobs. I highly suggest Dr. Haver if you are looking for a vet.< /review>

<Review>really great the couch here make you feel like home and the staff are very kind!! I give this place a green light. I like this place because it is next to the college and is open until 11pm!! Perfect for studying and being away from home. the food here is good also I like the Italian soda.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Perfectly roasted espresso! Both fun baristas gave lots of laughs in the short time while making my drink. Sitting outside on the patio was very pleasant on a Saturday morning. The only drawback was the plastic patio chair toughness. With just a little pressure leaning back, I felt like I could bend them in half. Luckily found a metal one to suit my posture :)<//review>

the place is mess. The couches are torn apart, the bathroom is disgusting. Their coffee is pretty good but the place needs to renovated. The AC doesn't work either, so it gets pretty hot. Would recommend coming here to study or work</Review>

We had a large group, and this place was the perfect place to hang out after dinner to talk.  They had nice espresso and gelato.  I could also see that this would be a great study place for De Anza College students.< /Text>

We ordered a bagel and croissant - they were not fresh  - we ordered chai and it was cold - when asked to reheat after reheating it was still not hot - coffee was cold also - when I went to get the coffee from the containers halfway through my croissant the person who makes the espressos/chai etc came running to check if I am getting a refill - when I said I am getting it for the first time he raised his eyebrows - gave the impression he believes that I am getting a refill - restrooms are very dirty - avoid this place - there are much nicer breakfast places like Le Boulanger close by< /Text>

This place is FILTHY! The bathroom is legit the nastiest bathroom I've seen in a restaurant.

The entire establishment is absolutely disgusting.  You'd be crazy to eat anything from here.< /text>

<Review>The office was very clean, comfortable, and welcoming. I had to travel there due to insurance, but it was worth it. The staff was friendly. I’ve been through a very difficult medical journey and this was just a follow up to my trials , so it was nice to see a change of not a typical office.<//Review>< rate>

There is ample parking. The opening time posted on the website and written on the door do not match actual opening time. The check-in process was smooth, used pen and paper. The tech was not there and needed to be texted and told I was there for my appointment. He arrived 20 minutes late. The facility itself was clean and comfortable but  not very attractive or calming. I received the MRI CD within minutes and my doctor received the radiology report within hours.
The best part was the kindness and care shown by the three staff I interacted with, and ultimately  it is the human contact that matters.</Text>

<Text>Front desk gals were very nice and gave me an estimated time when I would be seen.  This enabled me to grab a cup of Java nearby and return.

The MRI techs where very nice as well. They made sure I was as comfortable as possible even though holding still that long is not.  They also explained the process and how long it would take.

Overall a pleasant experience.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1617921354388, 'text': 'Thank you for the review!'}<//Resp><GmapID>0x808fcbda6fd79407:0x3cf6e1238429a839<//GmapID></record>

I got an MRI on my wrist and I had to be in a weird position on my stomach at my arm out. The technician made me feel as comfortable as possible both by talking to me and physically helping me on the table. She was kind and knowledgeable and helped make the experience bearable even when I started to panic. Great facility. Wide open and well taken care of.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

All the staff was friendly, worked professionally, quickly and respectfully. The imaging process was thorough and done with precision.

My only concern was how seating, lines,  and spacing during covid is being managed. Tight spaces and wheelchairs don't go together with large sofas for seating.<//Text>

<rating>1< /rating><review>One of the worst experience I ever had in my life. I wish I could give them zero or negative stars.

I was given an appointment for Saturday 4:00pm and the center was closed. I drove 40miles for this center.

Also I had inquired with scheduler that, website and Google maps says they are closed on Saturday the person said that the website is out of date.

Also called them 1hr before the appointment they said they are my appointment is confirmed.

Finally I realized there is no direct contact number for Santa Clara imaging it goes to the central scheduler bases out of different state and they do not have any clue.

I would say avoid this imaging center at all costs if you can.</review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1610031035544, 'text': 'Hello, we apologize for the negative experience you had with us.

Took TWO days to get x-ray of my wife’s right hand.  It was broken and we have been referred to an orthopedic doctor but because it took TWO days to get an x-ray she has to wait until next week.  DO NOT use these incompetent people!<//Text>

<text>This is the worst place to get an MRI or any procedure becuase they will set you up an appointment and then once you plan everything and reach they center they will tell you they cannot do the test as its not available in their facility.
These are completely unprepared people and lack knowledge of what procedures they carry at their own facility. Dont waste your time here go somewhere else.
They Dont even deserve one star.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>Horrible experience.
They use some bogus third party company for billing.
I paid the full amount during my appointment but received two different bills after a month.
Billing department is non responsive!</review>< pics>

The place is old and not very well organized, that is true. At the same time - the quality of their work is great! We never had any problems with a quality of their films or explanations.</review>

I try to avoid going back whenever I can. Unfortunately, some doctors insist on working with them.</review><name>Mike Brown< /name></record>

<text>I had an appointment so I only waited about 5 min for them to call me.  The rooms in the back are a mess. It looks like someone converted there dirty house into an imaging center. The technician didnt seem to care for my questions or concerns and just rushed me though.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Outdated equipment, not so clean and more expensive than others around the area. As an example, an ankle MRI costs 2700$ while the average is around d 1600$ in and around the Bay Area.<//text>

This shop has been my choice for many years for shopping guns and doing private party transfers. Last two times in, Oli, Nick, and Pop worked together to make my experience one of the best. Oli helped work out a deal for me and set me up with a buyer for a gun I was selling to my surprise I might add. Had no idea he was going to. Give these guys a shot if you are looking to shop guns or any pawn or selling needs.< /Review>

<Review>One of the best customer service experiences I have ever had. We were greeted by Oli when we went in to purchase a gun and he explained everything from the background process, ammunition, handling the firearm and even the concealed carry process. He was friendly, knowledgeable and took lots of time with us. You can tell that he takes his job seriously and isn’t just there to sell. The shop is clean, neat, felt safe and was well run. The other gentleman that assisted were just as friendly as Oli. If you are looking for a place to purchase a gun or any thing else visit 7th street pawn. You won’t be disappointed.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80c3644636823757:0x36f523378631adf3<//Gmap_id><UserId.>103019752043429002389<//UserId.>< Rating>

I've always had a great shopping experience at 7th st pawn. I have purchased from them the last 4 years in a row and they  have always been super friendly and helpful . The prices have always been great  as well. If you are in the market for a fire arm or need a place to do a firearm transfer I highly recommend  7th street pawn!!  Thanks Tom ,Ollie , and the rest of the crew !< /text>

Old guy there is disrespectful. Brought cash in hand to buy a gun but decided to leave after the service. Took my money straight to turners and bought the same gun NEW for the same price.</Text>

This place is absolutely horrible. The staff, and manager, are very rude and do not try to work with you at all. Go to a different pawn shop if you need one, not this place.<//Review>

tried selling my gold with them (6.0 weigh 10k) and (2.0 14k earrings) total amount they offered is $90.00 that was the highest they would go.  There attitude was more take it or leave it.  missing a small scrap of gold.  I did not check to make sure I got everything back.  People always check your item.  They did not give me any information as to how much each item weigh and how much they were offering for each item.  They just told me 90 dollars total.  10k and 14k always has a different price.</Review>

7th street pawn is a great & fair business. It has staff that is knowledgeable & professional. If your looking for something at a fair price, stop by and give 7th street pawn a look. On 7th just South of Mojave . You will be glad you did.< /Review>

Horrible shop. They don't proudly serve veterans and only care about making a buck. I went in with a friend who is in the military to buy a gun from him. He was on orders and they told us he couldn't sell me a gun. They pretended to call the DoJ and after 30 seconds of "being on the phone" they told us the DoJ said no. So we left and called a different gun shop and they told us it would be no problem so I went there instead and bought the gun. This place is garbage and nobody with any respect for the military should give them any kind of business.< /text>

Great customer service, guys behind the counter are plenty knowledgeable on firearms and are easy to talk to. I've bought several firearms from them and they'll be my first stop when I need anything.< /review>

<text>I have been having rifles/shotguns shipped to 7th st Pawn for just over 4 years and the staff are always professional and helpful. My most recent private party transfer was handled quickly and as always the paperwork was perfect. 7th st Pawn also does Gunsmithing, they carry a wide selection of replacement parts for triggers which makes the fix quick. If you're looking for a local shop that will make your weapon transfers quick and easy, look no further than 7th st Pawn!<//text>< response>

<Text>I called this place and explained what i had for sale, they looked it up online and gave me a price depending on condition. It was in very good condition so that wasnt the problem. they didnt even want it because they didnt understood how it worked. All directions were online, they should have said somthing before having me go down there so they could look at it. Waste of time and gas.  Very dissapointed in this place<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80c3644636823757:0x36f523378631adf3< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<rate>1< /rate><text>When you order a monster burrito and get this... Los Primos has gone downhill the last few years, I used to love their breakfast burrito’s and how massive they were, nowadays it’s like they don’t care. Plenty of other taco shops out there that don’t cheat customers. Also that soda cost me $3.25. You won’t see me back here!!< /text>< Gmap_id>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>Not sure what is going on at this location. Just ordered a "monster" breakfast burrito from this location with extra potatoes and the burrito was the size of a taco bell burrito. I should have ordered 2 of them to fill me up which would cost almost $19 dollars. I've eaten here in the past and never had an issue with their burritos being up to par. If you are going to label your burritos "monster," they should be at least average in size. Beware! Will not be going back anytime soon. Disappointed and still hungry!<//review>< pictures>

Your review does not reflect the standards that we try to keep. Monster Breakfast Burritos are not as large as Monster Size Burritos in the Monster Menu, however, they should be quite large. Maybe something went wrong in the kitchen.\n\nIf you could fill out a form at https://primosmex.com/feedback/ I would love to take care of this.

Amazing bean and cheese burritos. Sounds weird but the bean and cheese is probably the best bean and cheese ever had. Their tortillas taste freshly made and carne asada is amazing as well but really the si.e beam and cheese is Supreme.< /Text>

<text>Solid cuts from really laid back guys. I’ve been coming here for the past 2 years and always leave feeling fresh. Adrian is really attentive as well and happily makes tweaks per my requests. Give them a try and you won’t be disappointed. Oh, also make an appointment, which costs $5 more or come right when they open to avoid the wait.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Review>The choice to live this visit wasnot satisfied as of last attempt at contact. Alerted was mailed while incarcerated with no response provided. Upon returning I wrote once more, a day before I left to rehab suddenly. I remained in contact with him thriughout the drama I was buried amongst. Upon one particular visit during rehab, I was informed You had made a comment that hurt my feelings. I left it at that, and still tried to contact YOU when I returned from Harbor City.  Although I was in need of HELP from a source that is capable of managing my type of care, I left and kept going, like I told someone else, Can't $top Won't $top.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

The shop is clean, the people there treat you with respect, like you've been going there as a regular. The owner cool and down to earth. Make sure you set an appointment, they tend to get busy, especially on the weekends.</review>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>I pulled up for a 4 o clock appointment and could not find the place. Decided to call and try to find it. Somebody answered asking who my appointment was with. I didn’t know, I just know I had a four o clock appointment and it was never mentioned to me the name of the barber. The man then proceeded to tell me that they always mention the name of the barber (which in my case they didn’t) and that they could not help me. I hate leaving one star reviews but come on guys make an effort to have some better customer service instead of telling me I’m wrong.</text>< pics>

< Review>
Good hair cut place, I liked it because they are open late. 1 day I got there at 7:30pm they had 2 barber's and they both had someone waiting for a hair cut. I went in and they asked if I had an appointment because they don't want to stay late and they are closing after the people waiting. So it felt like I got kicked out at 7:30pm. Well I guess I have to look for a new place<//Review>

They never listen to exactly what you want done. I could never get my son haircut I loved. I was always left disappointed. Also they have no regards to children being in their establishment. They play movies with tons of cursing and racist remarks. They have the NERVE to ask the customers "does this bother you".
I'm sorry folks but I will not subject my son or family to a barbershop who has no consideration to their customers.<//text>

<Text>Honesty the best shop in the area I drive from Rialto to get my cut every other week!!
Plus every barber in there get down!!
Over all a fun spot to chill while you wait if you dont make an appointment and you can play the ps3 anytime.

Went in today for my apt at 915 and I got there late at 9:19. Yes i was a little late but damm they had already started cutting someone else. Which means that they didntneven wait a minute. I normally get my cut from Joey but today it was Tommy since he was off. I guess I learned my lesson.. don't switch barbers lol. This ruined my whole day since now I need to wait another week for a cut. Btw they waiting another 8 minutes to tell me they won't be able to get to me today. Wow! I normally tip $10 too so this was messed up.

Going to head to "against the grain barbershop " in Covina. They have 4.8 stars. Go check it out.<//Text>

Create little corner liquor store. Staff is always  Friendly. 5 stars is based on the expectation that this is a liquor store, you're pretty much just going there for beer, soda, ice or incidental things like eggs or butter, which they always seem to have in stock.<//review>

This store is tucked behind the strip mall which keeps the store itself hidden from the main flow of traffic on Oswell.

This place is great in a pinch and the staff is friendly. I also like the fact that they have a bottled water refilling machine outside, I use it quite often. The outside looks kind of withered tho.< /Review>

<Text>From the moment I arrived the staff took all the precautions to ensure social distancing was practiced. I felt safe and comfortable. Everything, including the seats, was sanitized. The staff have a great system so all concerned know which exam room and station is sanitized.

The doctors are always professional, personable, and knowledgeable.  I always feel comfortable discussing me concerns or asking questions.  I do not usually ask many questions because the doctor usually answers my questions before I have a chance to ask.

Great people. They really know what they are doing. I recently moved but I refuse to change my optometrist.

Finally, you cannot go wrong with the selection of glades frames. What took the longest at my visit was looking for the frames.  The staff does not rush you because they want you to be happy with your choice.</Text>< pictures>

<review>Always professional and always a great experience.  On a side note, they sometimes have bundt cake samples from next door.   Dr. Masuyama was great as always even with things all Covidy and the office one huge sterile field, I had a great time as one can have during an eye exam.

<Gmap_id>0x80c2d7d3e748e53d:0x91e87123afce8a53<//Gmap_id><text>I  love this place. The staff is really nice and they are knowledge. The place is clean and they take COVID CDC regulations very serious. They disinfect each station and each pair of glasses that you try on.  The main reason for giving 5 stars is the optician- the person that sits with you at the end to help you figure out your insurance payment and coverage. This gentlemen tall black male- He is the best!!! He really knows his stuff and really understands insurances. He knows how to navigate through the system/vision plans and provides good suggestions. He displays a thorough understanding of what they are selling and helps you understanding your benefits as well. I forgot to get his name but he is awesome!!! I went to American's Best and they are not even close to the level of service at Golden. If you're thinking about which place to get your eye exam- DO NOT go to America's Best. Don't waste your time like I did. They barely know how to use the computer and they ask each other for help all the time which takes even longer for you to get help. They lack training. The service at Golden is way superior to any other eye Doctor I've  visited. Good job Golden for hiring people that know what they're doing. I know my glasses and contacts will be the best and I know that I walked out with the best deal bc the staff looked very confident in their abilities and they took the time to explain everything to me. I like the itemized receipt!!!<//text>< userid>

<review>They are very professional, extremely kind and the office is well sanitized.  I had my eyes checked on “Sunday” they are open 7 days a week and I’ve got to give a shout out to the young man that did my pre testing before you see the doctor.  He was so kind, caring and very patient.  They eye doctor was amazing.  I would recommend anyone that need to get their eyes checked or just new glasses, best place in town!!<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Very happy with this office. My parents recommended it. It's big, spacious clean. The staff are all very friendly. They follow strict COVID procedures and sanitize everything; they also limit the amount of patients inside at one time. My eye doctor Ms. Lisa Masuyama was great. Very friendly, very knowledgeable, very patient with all my questions. She took her time in answering my questions and also making sure my contacts were the right prescription. Best Optometric I've ever been too.<//Text>

It was my first time here. They were so professional and very friendly. The flow of the appointment was very smooth from check in, to pre testing, to seeing the doctor, and to getting assistance with new glasses. I was referred here by my wife and she loves this place too. Dr. Wong was amazing. He was very thorough, kind, and responsive to my concerns. Thank you for the great service.<//Review>

<review>Do not use them for your children. My daughter had been a patient of theirs for some time. She began complaining of migraines. Our Dr informed us it was her vision. She had also broken the temple of her glasses so we decided to schedule an appointment. They scheduled her a month out. My daughter had to deal with the pain just for them to call me right before her appointment to tell me no one would be available to see her and they would have to reschedule her another month out. Did my research and found my daughter someone new who saw her the same week and she received her glasses two weeks later.<//review>< pictures>

I highly recommend Golden Optometric  Extremely helpful and patient.
I really didn't know what frame to pick and they were eager to help me pick out frames letting me see several of them probably around 10 different frames which I thought was very nice of them. A nice place with a great staff.<//Review>

<Review>This appointment was for my husband, and he said he had never had an exam as detailed as this one. He had so many questions and got answers for things he thought were hereditary issues. He was so comfortable and happy with the quality and service given to him that he will not go back to the old doctor. The Covid safety precautions they are taking are great as well he said. Definitely recommend this place.< /Review></record>

I’ve lived in West Covina for quite some time and got tired of the customer service at my eye doctor so I decided to give Golden optometric a try and I do not regret it. Excellent service and the Doctor was very caring and detailed oriented which made it very easy to understand my daughters eye examination. I definitely found my new eye doctor👍🏻< /text>

Golden Optometric has to be the BEST optometric office I have ever been to! The staff is so friendly and kind, but most of all accommodating. The are very careful to follow COVID protocol, and I really appreciate that! 10/10 would recommend anyone who needs to get their eyes checked or needs an amazing glasses selection to go there!<//Text>

They have a really good service, been a customer for almost 15 years and we have never had a negative experience and now with the covid 19 they have all the precautionary measures in place to keep customers safe. I really recommend this place to anyone.<//Review>

I had a wonderful experience at Golden Optometric. All members of staff were very friendly and efficient, the entire business was operating to high COVID sanitation standards, and Dr Wong was incredibly kind and made the exam stress-free. I would recommend this place to anyone, they really seem to care about their patients.<//Text>

<Text>My eyelid was suddenly very swollen and painful. They were able to fit me in the same day. They were taking precautions with everyone coming in, so I felt very comfortable going into the offices. I was treated very thoroughly and came home with supplies to continue treating it at home. I am already feeling relief and expect it to be cleared up in a few days.i was encouraged to come back in if it wasn’t cleared up in a few days. The entire staff is very hospitable and I feel I receive excellent care from everyone.<//Text>< Pictures>

< review>
I’ve been a patient at Golden Optometric for years. Two years ago I decided to find something closer to home (it’s a 45 min to 1hour commute). It was no where near the same experience. From the service to the care and follow up. The service and experience at Golden Optometric was by far the best I’ve ever received.

Even during these difficult times, they made my visit comfortable and easy. I would  sit in traffic anytime to visit Golden Optometric.< /review>

<review>I called on Tuesday June 30th ,2020.
My frames on my Prescription Sunglasses broke. I need to wear the Prescription Sunglasses whenever I am outside. They made an appointment for me Wednesday.
The Optician was very nice and searched for the same frames. They are discontinued since I bought the Sunglasses along with regular glasses four years ago.
She did a search inside the store and found a perfect frame for my lenses.
I was very pleased with her kindness and courtesy. She took her time to find frames that would be work with the lenses.
Thank you.</review>< Rate>

I've been going to Golden optometric for about 20 yrs.  My family member's also come here.  I thought I would try another optometrist, the "owl", if you know what I mean, wrong...   I'm back at Golden Optometric can't beat the Optometrists, techs and all the great selection of frames.  I will never stray again.  Happy Four Eyes.</review>

<pics>None<//pics><Time>1565290354735<//Time><Review>I have been a loyal customer/ patient ... each year this place keeps showing how important and understanding WE are. My son didn’t have such a good experience a few years ago when he attempted to get fitted for contacts. So he became overwhelmed and frustrated and chose to wait. Yesterday, Nancy was so patient, supportive and continued to work with my son. She shared with me at one point ( after probably an hour with him), when I was extremely thankful and thanking her... she replied, “no problem, this is my job. You know you’ve got to love what you do...” And it showed he he finally got them on and off..!! The office is well put together with greeting, to answering all questions. I was there for some hours and the quality of professionalism is TOP NOTCH!! May I add my Dr. Continued to work with me and helped make sure I had the correct type of contacts...  I love when offices keep improving and the staff enjoys their job!! 🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓< /Review><rating>5<//rating>< user>

<Text>It's always a pleasure coming into Golden Optometric! The staff is always super friendly and helpful. I definitely feel like all the optometrists are extremely knowledgeable and great at answering any questions and always make you feel comfortable. Krystal helped with the break down of my insurance and made the overall process smooth. Only downside is that a lot of the frames were a little out of my price range, but I tried to make it work. Highly recommended!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I have been coming here for many years.  Everyone is always very kind, competent and helpful.  I have never had a single problem or glitch with them whatsoever.  Yesterday I brought my 14 year old son to the optometrist for the first time.  He was nervous.  They were very friendly with him and made him feel welcome and comfortable.  It was a great experience and he picked out a fantastic pair of his first pair of glasses.  The optician was very patient in helping him find them and decide.   He looks so handsome in them!  Thank you so much for always taking such good care of your clients!</Text>

<Text>My experience with Dr. Anthony Wong and the team at Golden Optometric was nothing but fantastic. They truly care for their patients and go out of their way to help you. I had some issues with my insurance and was willing to pay out of pocket and get reimburse later by my insurance company for my contacts. They were concern with me getting my full reimbursement for my contacts because my situation is special that they rather order me extra trail pairs to get me through and have me order the contacts once I resolved my issue with the insurance company. This is an example of the extra distant this team goes to.< /Text>< Rate>

Since the first time I called and requested an apportionment they’re we’re great. I was skeptical after reading some reviews but I’m glad I came in. The doctor was very professional and friendly. After looking at glasses and treating myself to “designer brand” glasses I was scared to hear the total, but to my surprise I’ve paid more at my previous doctor in South Pasadena (no wonder, right?). I’m am super excited to get my glasses and wear them. I recommend this business and plan I’m getting all my family transferred here from South Pasadena.</review>

Once you have completed your exam and you’re ready to get your glasses you need to see  Randell. He is very knowledgeable and helpful. You would think he worked for Honda. I always asked for him.<//Review>

<review>I Came in for my exam they were able to take me in a little earlier than my scheduled appointment which was great ! I had my eye exam with Dr.Yang she was very sweet and educative about my new changes in prescription I also asked her if I could be a good candidate for Lasik the fact that she said yes was even more exciting. After the exam I went to see their selection and they had a wide selection of frames , I found the perfect pair ! My glasses got here so fast and I’m now adjusted to my prescription. thank you so much Dr.Yang and Golden Optometric!< /review>< gmap_id>

My family and I have been going here for years. Love it. My kids are really young (6&9) and they take time to explain the importance of wearing their glasses and are gentle during the exams. Alexis is GREAT! My glasses broke and I got another exam and ordered more. She was super nice when she was helping me picking out a new pair. She knew I was without glasses while waiting for my new pair. Alexis personally called me to let me know as soon as they were in!! I would highly recommend seeing her!!</text>

Wonderful, friendly staff. Can’t say enough positive comments about Dr Wong. He is wonderful!
Shout-out also to Randall!!  What patience as he taught me how to insert and remove contact lenses. A true gem.</Review>

I could go on and on about how wonderful everything is here, but I’ll keep it short and to the point. The optometrists LISTEN to you, genuinely do their best to meet all your needs, and take their time to do a thorough vision screening. I have a lot of trouble with my vision, have been to several optometrists, and this is the first office I visit where I leave feeling and seeing wonderfully!  They also have a large array of frames and sunglasses. You will NOT be disappointed. I’d leave my doctor’s name, but then I’d never fit into his schedule again; luckily, I’ve had great experiences with every optometrist I’ve seen there over the years. You cannot go wrong!< /review>

I had been a loyal customer for this clinic for over 10 years.  However,  I have seen a major decline on the quality of service over the years and I had to finally leave this clinic for good.
For example,  I have a Blue Shield Insurance and I was really enthusiastic to make an appointment to see doctors there.  However,  the front desk staff,  they were just not able to verify my insurance for up to 8 times phone calls from me and 1 time driving in, to request,  remind and repeat over and over again!
The worst thing is that,  the front dest staff lied about the actions they had taken and gave you the wrong information about your insurance,  making you feel like that you didn't have any insurance but making up the story!
I had to give up on them so I just simply Google for another doctor in West Covina.  The staff in front desk there, were very
Professional and she only took less than 5 minutes to verify my eligibility and made an appointment for me right away!
Therefore,  I have learned my lesson: no matter how long you have been going to one eye doctor,  always pay attention to see if they have lost the good quality over time,  then don't be afraid to leave,  since you and your insurance deserve the best quality of care.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Dr Fanny Lee Kwok was terrific, she spent a great amount of time examining my eye injury and gave great instructions for after care. She was caring and reassuring. My visit was exceptional from the moment I called in for an urgent appointment. Thank you everyone.<//Review>< Pictures>

I picked a frame ordered the glasses then I received a call a week later saying the only color they have doesn’t match what I picked out. Unfortunate that you spend time to go into the office to pick out glasses then they call a week later saying deal with the color change or come in again to pick something else out. I wouldn’t have cared about it if I had received some kind of discount.< /Review>

<rating>5</rating><Text>I came in and saw it located in a shopping center all the way in the back in the corner. I arrived 15 minutes before check in and filled out paperwork. Staff were friendly and the place was really clean, and they had complimentary pastries & coffee (P.S didn't try it out thought). A little after ,y appointment time I did some eye exam and in another 5 minutes met Mr. Wong who was very pleasant and made my experience very welcoming. I felt comfortable and the eye exam went by pretty quick and soon after choose my prescription lenses.

Overall, it was an efficient easy process with no hiccups along the road. I would definitely be coming back as a regular here. Highly recommended even if you already have an eye doctor.

Very unprofessional. Dr. Wong has to be the most ignorant person in the medical field and I have worked in the medical field for over 15 years. I have personally left him messages (around 13) and have yet to receive a call back (not a single call back). I called again and asked for him without saying my name, they said yes hold on he is right here. The receptionist got back on the phone to transfer me. Instantly they put me on hold and came back stating that he was with a patient. Typical... If I could give (-)5 starts I would. Thank God I'm not a patient at this place, I feel sorry for the patients who have to deal with such ignorance.</Review>

The initial prescription was not an error; as the doctors discussed with you, we felt you weren't ready for your full prescription, so we gave you an intermediate one to transition you into the full prescription. The rep who stated that it can take up to two weeks for the eyes and brain to adjust to a new prescription was telling the truth. But when your eyes didn't adapt, we remade the lenses without the intermediate prescription. Unfortunately, part of the delay in delivering these new glasses was due to not having the frame in stock, and then the lab lost the frames and we had to order them again. I understand that we communicated the first delay to you, but not the second. We apologize for the lack of communication and the lengthy delivery time. In the end, we issued a full refund and had the insurance company reinstate your benefits in full. If you have any other problems, please contact our manager, Nancy, at your earliest convenience. Again, our sincerest apologies for the inconvenience. If you decide to give us another chance, we'd be happy to have you back as a patient."}< /resp>< date>

< Review>
A nightmare of an experience! I returned my glasses because of a mistake on my prescription (added closeup boost when I only needed glasses for faraway). I tried to return them right away (5 minutes) as I was walking out and I felt like falling from a cliff. The customer representative said that it was normal for a new prescription and to wait 2 weeks to adjust. What a liar! I returned the glasses for fixing and to order a new frame. I ended up waiting 6 weeks and they never had my glasses ready. And on top of all, they didn't want to return all my money back which I had to fight it with the manager! The worse was just coming as I asked to reinstate my insurance benefits to go somewhere else for a new prescription and my insurance told me that they didn't because I returned the glasses after 2 weeks! Thieves and liars!
RESPONSE: As I said Thieves and Liars! They never "COMMUNICATED" that my prescription was NOT A FULL PRESCRIPTION, what is that! Also, THEY DIDN'T REINSTATED MY BENEFITS IN FULL! $160 to get another prescription! THEIR RESPONSE IS MISLEADING!<//Review>

Following up on my review, Nancy, the CSM reached out to me to tell me my temples were going to be replaced. I cannot wait to start using those glasses again! I went today to pick up my contacts and my encounter with her was very pleasant. I had to change my stars from 1 star from my prior review to 5 starts. Once my temples are replaced I will be super satisfied. Thank You Nancy.

prior review:
I just picked up my glasses and I am pissed! I brought in my own ray bans to get my prescription in and the employee Judy broke them . She said they snapped when she tried adjusting them. I asked why she adjusted them if I didn't ask for them to be adjusted . She said it was because sometimes when they come in from the lab that they are uneven. I already knew she didn't like me because when I came to get my eye exams a week before, she was helping me get my contacts and figure out pricing , I could tell she was bothered with my many questions. Now since I signed a waiver saying if something happens to my glasses, that they aren't liable. I'm so upset my ray bans are broken because she adjusted them without me even asking. If I could give 0 stars I would just for this employee!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1484292871285, 'text': 'Dear Carolina — We’re so sorry about your Ray Bans and completely understand how angry you are, but rest assured, it was not personal. We pride ourselves on being thorough in our work; in doing so, Judy did her best to adjust the frames and align them properly, like new. (We’d be quite embarrassed if we gave you back your favorite Ray Bans with new prescription lenses, and the frame was bent out of alignment!) We also pride ourselves on our patients’ satisfaction; in that regard, we’ve made some calls and while those particular frames have been discontinued, we were able to find replacement temples. I understand that Nancy (the manager) has been in touch to let you know we’ve ordered the parts and will repair the frames at no cost to you. Please let us know if you have any questions and we look forward to seeing you again soon. Happy New Year!'}</resp><gmap_id>0x80c2d7d3e748e53d:0x91e87123afce8a53<//gmap_id></record>

<Text>I been a customer for several years; my last few years have been poor. My tint on my sunglasses have been a frustrating experience. A few months after purchasing them the tint started to get foggy and started to peel off. I went to replace them and few months after that replacement; the tint started to peel off and started to get foggy. I’m not sure if I would recommend this business to anyone after this experience.< /Text>< date>

I have been going to Golden Optometric for almost 20 years and they always take really good care of me and my family. Dr. Wong and Dr. Kobayashi are both very knowledgeable and take the time to make sure all questions are answered before your appt is complete.</Text>

< Review>
I came here to get an exam so that I would be able to get prescription sunglasses. It really stinks when I have to drive home in the evening after classes and the sun gets into my eyes. It was my first time at the office so I was pleasantly surprised to see the neatness/cleanliness and friendliness of the place. All the employees were super friendly and they were polite. The office had a variety of frames that you could choose from. I do have to say, however, that the frames get pretty pricey compared to a few of the other offices I used to go to (They hold a lot of "brand" names though. Like, Lacoste, Prada, Guess, Rayban etc.). The exam went smoothly and the doctor was very helpful and informative in telling me what I needed to hear. They also give you the option of either getting your eyes dilated or going to this machine that just takes a picture of the back of your eye in case you don't have time to get it dilated. Overall, it was a nice experience :)</Review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><rate>5<//rate><text>05/27: i updated my rating to 5 stars. i went back in December 2016 because they had the best selection of framea to chooae from. the initial pair i bought suddenly snapped at the nose bridge after roughly 15-30 uses. it was past the exchange window but they went ahead and let me exchange for a completely new pair and redid the lenses without asking for a penny in return. it was clearly a loss for them amd they didn't even complain or put up a fight. i was expecting a long drawn out battle but to my surprise went smoothly. i referred my mom there and will grab another pair in a couple months. ive walked in on several occasions without interaction from the front office staff but the moment theyre engaged im conversation they are helpful. i do think if they went the extra mile and just asked if we need anything this place would have earned 5 stars in my initial review. either way i take back my 2 and give them 5 for not shafting me with 350 worth of broken frames. thumbs up will refer everyone i know here.

initial review gave them 2 stars: I went in today on my day off with my wife and no one came to ask if we needed help. There appeared to be at least three to four people behind the counter so I'm quite surprised no one reached out to us. We walked in without a hello and walked out without a goodbye. You have to try and miss a 6' male browsing glasses or just not care to say hello.< /text><GmapID>0x80c2d7d3e748e53d:0x91e87123afce8a53</GmapID><Resp>{'time': 1473367534844, 'text': 'Louis — I’m so sorry for the experience you had at our store the other day; thank you for bringing it to our attention.
