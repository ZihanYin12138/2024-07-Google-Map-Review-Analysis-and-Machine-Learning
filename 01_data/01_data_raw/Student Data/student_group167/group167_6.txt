The place is clean and neat. The staff is friendly and nice. The only reason why I’m giving it three stars is because they don’t show you the price and honestly for a French manicure I had to pay $100.00. Yes, they were a full set. I have gone to other nail salons and they don’t charge that much.<//review>

OMG ! What can I say about this spot girls, such amazing customer service. I scheduled my appointment same day and they were able to see me. My nail tech was LARRY such great work, I told him what I wanted ONCE and he got it done way better than I imagined 😍 Everyone in this boutique was amazing, professional and nice. They have a wide range of drinks for you once your seated.

This is by far the best place I've been to and I plan on becoming a REGULAR!<//review>

My daughter and I went to this place for the first time. They were very quick and accommodating. I like the options they have and everything was very clean and orderly. The staff is very friendly and inviting. The materials they used thus far are great quality and have lasted for a week now with no crack, chip, or anything of the sort. I definitely would recommend this place and the price is straight foward and the staff will tell you on the spot if in case you wanted to do something else< /text>

The trend in nail salon is toward a painted interior with gausy white curtains, crystal chandeliers and orchids. I am found of this type of relaxing atmosphere found here over the default of white walls and fluorescent lighting.
My technicians were skilled and didn't nip me once.<//Review>

I love coming to this place. I especially love that when I walk in the door I am greeted by name by the owner. It's very clean and well lit. They offer beverages and chilled wine whether you are having your nails done or just waiting for someone else to finish. Amy has done my nails for years and I will continue to recommend this establishment to friends and family. Everyone that works here are very talented and professional. During the holidays the owner showed all the patrons her appreciation by giving every single person a Thanksgiving gift of appreciation. It is pricey but well worth it!<//text>

Loving this place, I have really high standards when it comes to customer service & cleanliness. If you want both and more this is the place for you. As soon as I walked in the owner kindly greeted me with a smile and proceeded to assist me. I walked in with out an appointment wanting to see what this place was all about for a fill and pedicure. During my entire stay I was treated very kindly, offered drinks of a wide selection, and friendly conversations with both employees who attended to my needs. Owner and employees really care about their customers satisfaction. I have to say I’ve been to many nail salons and NEVER have a found a location like this. 5 stars for me if I could add more stars I would do it in a heart beat.<//review>

Been a customer here for a bit owner had no regard for my scheduled appointments yes they serve wine and coffee but so does other new salons. I don’t care to go back after my visit today. And rudeness is beyond words when they start speaking their language and you know it’s about you and all your asking is to value your scheduled appointment times I understand 5-10 minutes here and there but to rearrange my entire appointment. Also my husband had an appointment here and was delayed because I was getting my nails done so the owner figured she could delay him and take another walk in customer before him where as he had an appointment.He already stopped going there Tran may seem nice but she is all fake for the business  Overpriced and act like they doing you a favor by giving you five dollars off after you spend 100. Also tips are up to the customer but the owner pushes it upon you. So glad I found a brand new salon not far from them and yes they serve you drinks and are clean and new too.< /Review>

Love this place! I had a pedicure with Jenny and she was amazing. Customer service is always top notch. I hope it always stays like this. Place is very clean, offer drinks, wide selection of colors. One thing that I also love is that they don’t charge you a service fee to use your credit/debit card. That really annoys me when a place charges you a fee. Been going here since Tran opened , and I must say everything is perfect.
Thank you!

I can’t explain how much I love this place. It feels like another home to me. I moved out to the Bay Area in January and immediately became best friends with the owner, Trang Vo. She is so hard working and dedicated to her company that she goes through extreme lengths to keep her customers happy. Her employees are all great and I am so happy with my nails every time I leave. I want to say thank you to nails spa boutique for making me feel so welcome. Keep up the great work<//Text>

<review>I am very new to this salon, maybe  a few months now and I couldn't be happier. They all go out of the way to take care of you offer beverages. Most importantly they clean the heck out of this place. They even wipe down spa chairs. The owner does a spot check on your nails to make sure you got the best service. She found 2 small flaws on how my nails were buffed and had my girl fix it so my nails would look perfect. I will definitely be a regular.</review><rate>5< /rate>< Pics>

This is the best experience I've had at a nail salon EVER. They truly value quality nails and customer service. This will definitely be my go-to nail salon from now on. And they do dip manicures! (I've been looking for a good spot to get these)

I recommend calling ahead and making an appointment because due to their wonderful service, they can get quite busy!<//Review>

This place is a stone throw from my place, which makes it great! and their service is good. I don't go often enough (no judging my toes) to know who does nails best, and I usually get the basic pedi.

I have gotten a wax, and this last I walked out with a bruise. She was good, and fast, but was slathering the wax on, so it really pulled on my skin. But nothing too damaging, but not all clients would feel this way.< /Review>

This new nail shop that Trang has opened is absolutely fabulous. Don't get it confused with her previous shop As she has opened up her own in the same area. If you are looking for Cathy or Trang they are now both at this location.</review>

<Text>Bad experience, went in to get eyebrows done and owner said she could not do my eye brows because she was too busy with cleaning the shop. She then told me to sit I waited for 15 min into I asked her how much longer she then looked irritated and frustrated and asked if someone else could do it. I said no my appointment was with u. I said If u are too busy I can go somewhere else..she said yes thank u. I feel that was very unprofessional and I will never go back to her shop and will never refer anyone again. Bad way to treat a good paying customer. Never again:(<//Text></record>

<Text>(Translated by Google) They really know what they do. I love that they use sterile utensils and disposable equipment per client take precautions to avoid some kind of fungal infection, very friendly staff. I love this place since the moment I booked an appointment they really know what they're doing, their utensils are sterilized and everything else looks very clean, employees are very nice.

(Original)
Realmente  saben lo que hacen. Me encanto que usan utensilios esteriles y equipo desechable por cliente toman precausiones para evitar algun tipo de contagio de hongos , personal muy amable. I love this place since  the moment I booked an appointment they really know what they're doing,  theirs utensils are sterilized and everything else looks very clean,  employees are very nice.<//Text>< pictures>

I am only giving it a 1 star because i have to put at least 1.
They have the worst customer service.
I tried calling and they never answer and when they do they are rude.
Whenever I order from doordash my wings are super dry, willing to pay extra but of course... they never answer.</review>

<Review>Not only do you take forever even when i order ahead, but ontop of that there is ALWAYS something wrong or missing with my order!!! In the beginning y'all would forget my fries and my dipping sauces so then I learned to check my order,  but then later you guys forget to season my fries and they did not even include the 2 tenders I paid $2 for!
Today January 10th, 2021 at around 8:40 the service was terrible. DO BETTER.<//Review>< name>

Always delicious,  the only disappoint was that the multi flavor Coke machine wasn't working properly. But we enjoyed it very much, I was glad that they close late, midnight.
We were looking for Chinesse food at 9:30 pm but couldn't find anything open in San Mateo.</review>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>We went there yesterday, got chicken and fries. The problem is that they put SO MUCH salt in the food and on top of the fries — there was so much as if they were trying to poison someone!! We could taste nothing but salt and grease! Does ANYONE regulate this joint at all? Does any of the employees have any basic understanding of how proper tasty food is supposed to be cooked and how dangerous high sodium levels are for most people?? Stop making people ill and contribute to the obesity epidemics! Chicken wings and fries can be cooked properly in a much healthier way. Ask Italians or French how they manage to do that!! It's not a rocket science!!!!!

PS they also got us a wrong order first so we had to wait longer to get the "right" one<//Review>< pics>

Now my husband had to go back to San Mateo to return the order and rub the food on the employee's face and get the money back.

I come here every sunday for the last 2 years.    I think today was the last.     Called for 10 min to place an order nobody ever answered the phone.    When I arrived I placed the order to who I believe is the manager.  Was I witnessed as I ordered was an employee eating and working without washing his hands.   And did I say he was licking his fingers.    People coming in and leaving because the manager left and went to the back to deposit the drop.    Phone was just ringing and nobody was answering it.     The only worker was training someone.    Please wear gloves wash your hands and get more help.    What happen to the other manager that was always there he did everything</review>

I really like the mango habanero sauce and go here when I'm feeling in a junk food kind of mood. Portions are huge and the fries are good. I recommend calling and ordering ahead as service is really slow. Their system saves your order to your phone number, so if you have a regular order (like boring old me) it's convenient.</Text>

The missing star is due to several issues being present such as the bathroom being in a bad state and the drink machine not working for about 30 minutes.

Also I do not recommend the baked beans - very odd taste.

But the wings kept it at a 4/5.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

It's not the quality of the food nor the cleanliness of the restaurant that makes me rate this location 2 stars. It's the lack of staff in the restaurant. One person was taking orders, handling money, and making food. Where is the manager to take charge of his team? I'm not likely to go inside if there is only one person multitasking. This was about 9:30p. And there was a line when I got there just to order while 4 other people waited about 20 minutes for their food.<//text>

<review>My go-to spot for those late evening wings cravings. I would categorize this as fast food (although food usually takes 15-20 mins or so) but food is always pipeing hot fresh and delicous, worth the wait. Staff always super friendly which is really nice. Get the lemon pepper flavor. You're welcome.</review><time>1536043402860< /time></record>

Literally just saw a rat over 6" run through the lobby.  Still took my food.  Other customers asked for a refund.< /review>

We ordered Garlic Parmesan wings.. they mistakenly made Lemon Pepper wings and then dumped Parmesan on top of it to correct their mistake... My friends tell me this location messes up order frequently.</review>

<Text>Cashier spends time taking phone orders while people in person are in line waiting for their orders to be taken. This is while 3 workers are standing behind the cashier waiting for work. Then the dinner rolls at $4.99 for 6 pcs are just not rolls at all. Not warm nor tasty. Not coming back.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>$50 for eh chicken.
Potato salad has too much mayo, needs lots of work.
Chili is too sweet, needs lots of work.
Would classify as "Expensive".
KFC is sooo much better chicken.</review>< Pics>

<time>1478497643576< /time><rating>1<//rating><review>Worst service ever, we bought coupons from wingstop and some of them we couldn't use because the button wasnt there or they didnt have what was on the coupon. For example if we buy 32 oz drink we get 5 free wings, but they didnt have the 32 oz drink so we told we had to purchase two 20 oz drinks to get a 5  free wings. I complained to the manager via the online "contact us" form they admitted since they didnt have the 32 oz drink it was their fault, so the mananger said he but 10 free wings and 30% off next purchasae  on my "account". I went to go redeem it and cashier said its not there and I'd have to pay full price.</review>< pics>

They are always very friendly and very polite but they don't have many things that I would ever know what it is.  I stop in to pick up milk and a lot of tomes they don't have either 1% or 2%    If I need anything more I go elsewhere.  I use it for the convenience since it is difficult for me to walk through a larger store.  I have never seen more than 1 other person in the store at the same time as I am.  They don't even open until 9AM.<//text>

< Review>
You know, you end up in a neighborhood for a soccer game and need a little something to eat and you find one of the most wonderful Indian restaurants run by the most wonderful Indian people.  That was some of the best Indian food I've ever had.  Made fresh daily and the fruit smoothie I tried was the best you can get in the states.</Review>

Lots to offer! (And by the way it's not just cash)
It's basically a mini-mart and an extensive Indian market. Plus they have a restaurant with classic American Pizza and Indian classics like Curry's and an array of appetizers.
They also have a huge Indian dessert case!< /Review>

Everything is good the food, the people and the atmosphere. Very convenient. The people are very hospitable. The food is the best I've tried by far. This is a local business I look forward to going to when not only hungry but to enjoy a coffee and have conversations.< /review>

<text>Fresh dishes and perfect Anniversary romance! Sonoma was our server and she was fun, attentive, and super informative. Everyone from the hostess to Sonoma, to the kitchen made sure our gluten free 29th wedding anniversary was perfect! We enjoyed our wine and even indulged in the best creme brulee we have ever had! The best way to celebrate our 29 wonderful years of wedded bliss! ❤️</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5VALwYbRl4MX0Hlf3L9bPZEHp85C63W-MxdY9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBqqfeVOLv6CerWqGpixRuNyNWyqTMCygVhUMq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5QoARhlHgoQfvjMqg6B7EvAuzQ7UvruAECMNk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Response>

< Review>
Good food, exemplary service, and a superb selection of wines in comparison to other places I've been to before. The place wasn't so bad both of their interior and exterior designs. The staff was very professional and knowledgeable of what they sell to. The ambiance is nice and has an affordable price. Five-stars to this wine shop.</Review>

<review>Visited San Diego, strolled the Gas Lamp Quarter found Toscana Cafe & Wine Bar for happy hour. Enjoyed the delicious Salsiccia with a glass of Red Sangria. Comfortable outdoors seating during COVID and friendly staff. Great to support jobs.<//review><username>Steven Marquez<//username><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNsi5eUBiZpd_cEQl2GFMCu9ComjevOcxkHe-8K=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOi7lyqIHiKh8ALHB_XjtdozYNy7Xj3HVmpBUFl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwwqyXq2u_o5IyYm1CgNnWPI8kN9Ydg7fyOoBw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

WOW just WOW this place was slower in service for 12 and it wasn't crowded and parking was a disaster but the food. THE FOOD. Was lovely I couldn't get enough of my pasta I enjoyed every last bite, it wasn't too cheesy like I had feared it was delicious!< /review>

The staff here are amazing! We had such a good experience and it was so nice to rest after a long day. It's a small place, so you will feel very cozy, but the food is delicious! My only regret was not taking my leftovers with me. It was definitely one of the best meals I had while I was visiting San Diego.</text>

This place is right on gaslamp district so you cant miss it, I decided to give it a try when I saw a couple of people having steak at the out door seating. The food was okay,  the bread that came out was tasty yet it felt like it was old, the steak did not feel like it was well seasoned, and the mashed potato was outright bad. I gave this place 3 stars because the service was great, I might go there again to try a few other things. But for this trip the 3 is justified.<//review>

This is a great place to go to relax with some nice wine or have a good meal. The menu has a wide variety of choices. There is also a happy hour and kid's menu available. The deserts are house made and superb! The service is also fast and friendly.  I highly recommend the Toscana Cafe & Wine Bar</Text>

<text>After a long day of travel I just got into the Gas Lamp district and needed to get a quick bite to eat. The service was quick and friendly the food was amazing. The ambiance set the mood for small groups to come gather and eat together making memories. I ordered from the anti pasta section of the menu and it was amazing, cobetta, type of meatball and a NYC style cheesecake. Great place a definite do again</text>< pictures>

<Text>I remember stumbling upon this restaurant with my husband when I took him to San Diego for the first time. We were staying at the Hilton Gas Lamp District so we were just walking by looking for dinner. We ultimately decided to eat here and we’re seated right away. Since my husband is French I always let him choose the wine. I don’t recall the exact bottle but myself being a huge wine lover enjoyed it. We got an appetiser that consisted of toasted bread with various fruits, jams and cheeses. It was just what we wanted after a fun long day in San Diego. We both complimented the honey given with the plate because it included pieces of honey comb. We both ordered pasta main plates in which both were simple Fettuccine Alfredo and Ravioli. Both were very delicious but if you’re looking for a huge plate you won’t be satisfied. I was just full enough with everything. The servers were attentive and very nice with us. We would be happy to return when we’re in the states.<//Text>< pics>

Enjoyable dinner at this Italian restaurant in the Gaslamp area. It was a slow Monday so we got seated right away.
Food was tasty and not over seasoned which I liked.<//review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Beautiful atmosphere and food. The hostess and waitress were friendly and helpful. We got the sausage plate, the bruschetta, fettuccine Alfredo, and spaghetti and meatballs. Everything, except the spaghetti was fabulous. The spaghetti is for someone who likes a lighter sauce with a lot of fragrant herbs. The rosemary was  overpowering the tomato sauce itself, which isn't something we like very much, but the Alfredo was some of the best we've had. Like I said, everything else was absolutely delicious and worth going for. The flower is edible too!</Text>< pictures>

Located just 2 blocks west of Petco Statium in the heart of Gaslamp district. After a warm greeting from Marlin, we were happily served by Sonoma. Sonoma provided excellent service in a charming Italian setting. The food was delicious and perfectly portioned. I enjoyed the pumpkin ravioli special, while he dove into an amazing charcuterie. A picture says a thousand words.< /review>

It claims to be the best cioppino in sf, though I haven't tried others but I'll agree that it is fantastic. We also had the risotto, and it is even better. The main ideas is do not go cioppino first, because the flavor is so strong with all the seafood and it makes the other dishes tastes plainly. We took the risotto home and it still tasted fabulously the next day</Review>

Their oysters were so fresh and affordable. The crab was perfectly seasoned. Omg, even their complimentary bread was fab. Service was on point. My only gripe is that the plates on our table when we were first seated were dirty, one even possibly stained with blood, and though we addressed it with the busboy, there was no apology. I sound spoiled, but I feel like this is a legitimate concern/complaint.<//review>< pictures>

<rate>4</rate><Text>Came here for Dine CA restaurant week Jan 2020. They have a great 3 course menu that comes with a glass of red or white wine. I started off with the Crostini Di Burrata, which was delicious, but nothing mind blowing. For main course I go the Linguine Carbonara and my fiancé got the Pappardelle Al Fumo. Both were great, but I'd recommend the Pappardelle Al Fumo over the carbonara. We ordered a glass of red wine to go with our meal (part of the dine LA menu), and the wine was old, sour and vinegAry. We took a couple sips and couldn't finish it. The dessert was so delicious. We had the coffee nocciola, it was a hazelnut ice cream based dessert. So delicious! Overall, it was a cute date night spot with good authentic food.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I had a late breakfast at this restaurant and was extremely disappointed with the service I received. First, I was seated outside and I took them 8 min to bring a glass of water. After my meal was served I waited for my server to bring me the check and ended up waiting 10min until I decided to call the restaurant from my table. I called and the waiter who answered was very rude and I asked to speak to the manager and he said the manager was not here and he hung up. Called again same waiter answered and told him I was the same person calling and wanted to speak to manager and he was super mad and almost hung up on me again and I told him I was sitting outside and only wanted my check! He came outside he approached me with an aggressive attitude and  told me that the only thing I wanted was to get out of paying the check! He grabbed the check and was about to leave I asked him for the check and told that was no way to treat a customer. I did pay the check but I left him 0 as a tip! So disappointed about this because I live just across the restaurant and I have always enjoyed eating there. Bad server Bad attitude horrible experience!</text>

The dumplings were also very good too. It's kind of small so expect a wait especially on weekends. Service was also very pleasant. There are both soup and fried noodle options as well.

I came to San Diego all the way from Edinburgh for my business conference and immediately started to search nice places to visit on Yelp. I was lucky enough to find this lovely Toscana restaurant which I visited with a couple of colleagues from Latin America, with very high quality food (our choice of salmon salad and the perfect fruity white wine that I guarantee you’ll enjoy to say the least), great customer service with a very friendly staff and even the music, decorations and the restaurant atmosphere were really lovely! I highly recommend Toscana and will definitely go back in my next visit to San Diego!<//text>

Service was very slow. Shrimp scampi was microwaved and flavorless. The pesto penne was OK, but had uncooked vegetables. Overall disappointed.

Not worth it.</text>

<rating>2< /rating><Text>It was a very nice restaurant/bar. It was a short walk from the San Diego convention center which is why I went there. The food was delicious. Unfortunately because of the proximity to the convention center and around lunch time I felt the wait staff was very under-prepared. Was given a glass of water when I sat down and order was taken shortly after sitting down. So thought service would be quick. It took almost 10 minutes of being out of water to get a refill from a different server despite my original server walking pass me numerous times. After sitting in the restaurant for almost 40 minutes I finally received my food and then had to wait for utensils and napkins to be grabbed. The waiter that did take care of me was nice and the food was good, but if I go back it will NOT be during a lunch or dinner rush.<//Text>< pics>

My fiancé and I went for a very romantic dinner and this place exceeded our expectations. Our server, was very knowledgeable and gave us excellent recommendations on both the food and wine. The caprese salad is a must! Everything we ordered had a very unique flavor and tasted wonderful.</Review>

This is an enjoyable place to eat. They have outside seats, which is pleasant barring the occasionally loud traffic.

The food is good. Pretty straightforward Italian fare. Lunch dishes were the right size, if a little pricey.

The server and hostess were very friendly.<//Text>

<text>Looking for Italian that was not a chain restaurant. Stopped in on a whim for dinner. Service was very good, beer cold and my wine top notch. Shared a meal (small plate charge). Pesto pasta, which also was good. My husband ordered a caprese salad which he liked. Fresh bread with oil and vinegar. A bit pricey, but right in the gas lamp district. Sat on the sidewalk and people watched. LOL</text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80d9535a41d0ede9:0x9c1f64babc8424b4</gmapID></record>

First time at this place during my vacation to San Diego.  It took extremely long to receive water, which needed to be sent back due to soiled glass.  We order hummus served over toasted bread.  Our food arrives and the bread is beyond hard. We could hardly chew and ingest it. We communicate this to our server and were told, this is what toasted bread looks like. We were both shocked, as if we've never consumed toasted bread! There is a clear difference between toasted and hard, stale bread. We would not recommend it. Less than 20 minutes after the meal, my stomach became violently ill. I got food poisoning. Simply the worst< /Review>

It's a good place, food is regular nothing special, but the service is the worst, they forget the order, beverages etc... and the place was not full, to understand that they are busy, and other customers has the same issue.🤷🏻‍♂️
One plus they when I check my charges they, put more than I authorized, currently checking with bank to reject the transaction,,😡</Review>

We came to celebrate a birthday and everything was great.  The service was always friendly and polite.  The pasta (we both had the same pasta) was great.  It tasted authentic, fresh, and sophisticated.  We also loved the side of brussel sprouts roasted in olive oil and salt.  Finally, they even gave us a birthday tiramisu which was sweet and unexpected.  Thanks Belotti for a sweet birthday!

However, the food always tastes amazing. They have the best chicken marsala in the city imo and often make the trip down just for that. I often have to wait for people to look the other way so I can pick the sauce off the plate it is that good.< /Text><Name>Cory Brin<//Name><rate>4< /rate>< Pics>

This place has the BEST fettucini alfredo I have ever had in my entire existence. I came to San Diego for a conference and thats when I tried it. Its been a year and I was on the search for this restaurants name for the longest time. Today I finally found it. I'll never eat that kind of fettucini alfredo again - I think about it everyday.<//text>

This place took our large group on a moments notice.  It was busy already and we had great service. The food was ok, my branzino was really good.  I judge an Italian place on their tomato sauce though and it was sad, bland, and not great.  Drinks were really good as was dessert.< /review>

First, let me acknowledge that I don't appreciate owner pretending to be a customer to get customers into empty restaurant.  One of the waiters asked the owner how the food was when we were outside looking at the menu. He responded with "delicious". It was a ploy to get us into the empty restaurant. Later when I went to the restroom, we see him walk in the restaurant and go into the kitchen.  I hear him speaking Italian. Very dishonest.
Secondly, now to the food...I ordered chicken Parmesan. Chicken tasted old and sause was bland...no flavor at all. Plus I got food poisoning For 2 days. Very disappointed overall. Two other dishes in our party were also disappointing, Eggplant Parmesan and the Carbonata dish. I should've told you the chicken was old. I left most of the dish. Never returning!< /text>

Customer Service was great throughout all staff. Friendliness was out of the ordinary. Very kid friendly place! Location is obviously great.
Food was so and so. The salad was really good, the pasta dish for the kid was good, the regular pasta dish was a disappointment (hard pasta, too much sauce). When the staff was informed about the disappointment it was 'well noted' without any offering for correction.
Overall a positive experience but leaves room for improvement.<//Text>

I just left this restaurant and feel that I must warn others...DO NOT EAT HERE.  This place serves the worst food that I have ever been served and does it with no shame or respect for the customer.  You would do better going across the street to The Old Spaghetti Factory. That is how bad the food is here.  Meatballs were gummy and flavorless and I have no idea how pasta can be cooked so that it coats your mouth in a weird film.  The prices are out right robbery and the staff has no apologies for plates that are collected with the meal intact.  You have been warned.<//Review>

We tried to order light. Ordered a simple Caprese salad and the Tuscan Sampler  Plate. Wow. The salad was great but the sampler was amazing. I was hoping my date was going to split it with me but I ended up having to do all the heavy lifting. Pretty fabulous food!<//text>

I was in San Diego for a conference and stopped for lunch. The food was ok, but the service was lacking the day I was there. I sat 20 minutes before I even had a glass of water brought to me as my waitress seemed to have forgotten me as another waiter finally asked if I wanted water. Then I had to wait even longer for my order. From the time I was seated to the time I received my food was 40 minutes.</review>

<Text>The food was horrible especially for the price.  The salmon came out raw.  I ordered the Pasta Pomodoro and it was bland.  We had to wait on two of our dishes for the table.  I would not return here.  The food was not worth the price.< /Text><Time>1558238379296</Time>< gmap_id>

<review>Really bland food. I had the shrimp fettuccini that tasted like they poured the cheapest jar of Alfredo sauce from a supermarket and did nothing else. The shrimp and the salmon were overcooked. Service was just okay. They wont even offer you parmesan or bread unless you spend over $100. Clearly this is a mediocre tourist trap. Go across the street to the old spaghetti factory instead.< /review>< UserId.>

Thieves ! The server Ian stole a tip off of my card that I did not authorize !! I specifically did not leave him a tip because he was drunk while serving us and His service was the most dreadful experience that I have ever had dining in a restaurant. My cousin and my sister and I went in on st. Patrick's day to grab a bite for my sisters birthday. We all ordered the special, which was salmon Caesar salad. My cousin and my sister received their salmon salad within three minutes after ordering. I did not receive my salmon special until one hour later.. honestly Ian forgot to even ring in my order!! I had to flag down another waiter and the other waiter even told me Ian never rang it in.  I know he was drunk it was clear as day and it was unprofessional , it was st. Patty's day but come on , you are at work! He was breaking glasses everywhere, he even served us dirty water !!!!!!! There was also a guy there that looked like a manager just standing there not giving eye contact , watching all of this occur ! I contacted the manager to tell her how he fraudulently took his own tip off my card and she gave me the most insincere apology and told me she'd look into it and still has yet to contact me back! I honestly deserve a whole refund after this whole experience! If the manager doesn't contact me back someone's going to jail because this is fraud ! And last but not least Ian didn't even remember to give us our checks ! We had to remind him five times that we were ready to pay !< /text>

service is very professional proficient and knowledgeable about spirits and coffee.

<rating>2< /rating><Text>Sadly was not impressed at all by this restaurant. We only stopped in for drinks and dessert, and while the tiramisu martini was really good, the chocolate cheesecake was not at all, and my friend's drink, well. She likes her bourbon, and she says it was a terrible bourbon. Frankly I'm not even sure we got the right cheesecake, because I know I saw what looked like chocolate cheesecake getting walked past us to the patio and had to watch with longing. The service was not the best, BUT this was the first full night of SDCC and the con-goers were out in force. They were busy, inside AND out. So I swear that the 2 stars is only about 30% reflective of that. I can acknowledge that they were busy, but I can't really excuse how long we were there for just dessert, trying to find then flag the man down.</Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

My wife got the pasta primavera. She commented on the fresh veggies and the tasty sauce. I got the pasta carbonara. Tasty shrooms, good pancetta, good sauce. Solid Italian food. Not much more expensive than Olive Garden, and quite a bit better.< /Text>

<Text>Our server was Mathew. They weren't busy we got seated right away. Then it took around 15 minutes for our server to even talk to us. Then they didn't bring everything we ordered, and he never came to check on us. No drink refills. Finally after over 40 minutes before someone finally came by with the bill- which had the items we didn't receive on it, which he would have known if he'd ever come by. When we finally got a hold of him he didn't even apologize for anything<//Text><Response>None< /Response>< Pics>

Don't go there! They will overcharge your card, then not return your calls. I've been trying to call for weeks to get it resolved, there's never a manager there & they don't call back. The food was ok & everything was overpriced. Especially when they charge your card double what it was supposed to be. I still have not gotten my money back. I suggest going somewhere else.</Review>

Decor is high end, the food is just okay.  Breakfast was fairly standard, coffee was good.  Came back for a mid day glass of wine and a sampler platter of charcuterie and cheeses.  Disappointed to see it was just cold cuts like you'd find in a grocery.  :/< /Text>

<text>Service was average at best. Waiter dropped out food off and wasn't seen again until we were done and had been waiting for 10 minutes.
The food was unimpressive. It seemed as if they had a great menu but poor execution on the recipes. Both of our pasta dishes were swimming in watered down sauce. Pesto sauce should be light and flavorful. This was runny and bland.
The children's menu chicken sandwich was a great size, but it was completely dried out, from the chicken to the toasted bread. There was no sauce or mayo to add moisture that was severely needed.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><time>1430231250682</time><user>100079797872207823800<//user></record>

Great if you want to eat things you didn't order and wait 30 min for eggs, then some more for an oj. Also recommended for anyone who enjoys being ignored by staff. If you like rude service, this is the place. Bon apetit!<//text>

Disappointing. Had to get up and find a server after 20 minutes of waiting to order. Staff seems bothered by being there. A real disconnect.  I ordered a steak Panini. Not sure why a slab of steak placed between bread would be edible.</Text>

We come to this place every year for Comic Con because our friends like it. However if it was up to me I would not set foot in this place. The service is less that standard (I have been waiting for a glass of water for 10 minutes already) -and the place isn’t even packed. The food is overpriced ($15.95 for a salad!). I am disappointed once again.< /Review>

I just moved downtown a few months ago and ending up stumbling upon this cute little Italian restaurant called Toscana right in the heart of the Gaslamp. A friendly hostess named Caitlin greeted me and sat me at a nice table on their patio– it’s the perfect place to people watch. My server was AJ and he was incredibly friendly! He recommended that I order a drink from their espresso bar and I’m very glad he did! Coffee is the best I’ve had downtown. I ended up ordering the special of the day which was a steak and spring mix salad! I don’t eat steak much but it was to die for! It was like butter– it melted in your mouth! I also had a little cup of their soup of the day which was chicken and Farro. It was very good and you could tell it was fresh. This place is definitely going to be a regular for me now. I can’t wait to go back and try more.</review>

<Review>Advertising Exceeds Ability ... Attractive place in touristy Gaslamp Quarter, and it shows. "Italian" food not really Italian. Heavily advertised wine list is just that - a list; it does not reflect what they really have. There was no sommelier, and we settled for our third choice of wine, which was just drinkable - barely. Under-ripe tomatoes in the Caprese salad; over-salted, somewhat gelatinous Carbonara. People were nice, but not nice enough to make up for mediocre food. Next time, we'll look to Little Italy for Italian food.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>I wouldn't recommend this place. There's probably better places to eat at the gas light.

I give it an extra star because servers were way nice albeit slow. They are very considerate not to interrupt you though. Otherwise, I'd give the speed and food flavor a 2. The drinks were very yummy and average priced, though still slow to get them.

Had the chicken toscana pasta and it had no flavor even though we waited an hour or more for it. I'd understand the long wait for food if it was busy, but it wasn't. Bruschetta appetizer was very yummy, but the amount you get isn't worth $10.< /review><rate>3< /rate><Name>Alison T</Name>< GmapID>

The location in the Gaslamp district is very convenient for walk by traffic. Staff were pleasant. The Primavera pasta would have taken a lot to get up to bland. Adding significant salt assisted. The sauce for the chicken marsala was too loose. Not a restaurant we would return to.< /text>

<text>I love this place! Walked the entire strip looking from grilled prawns and wasn't having any luck. We can across this place and the host was humour and very attentiv. We said we were gping tof continue to walk the rest of the strip and if all failed, we would be back. So much to choose from but the hostess had as sold. We returned and we were extremely happy we did so. The food was exploding with satisfaction!!! Our server was superb! Plenty of food. Very happy with dinned here!< /text>< pictures>

<Review>The food lacked flavor. Not family friendly. No room for stroller... and both bathrooms fail to provide a diaper changing area.
Last time we ever dine at this restaurant.<//Review>< rating>

<Review>Customer service is not a priority for these guys, and do not bother asking for a manager if you are dissatisfied. I waited 45 min for my plate and it did not come out, I asked for a manager and he was "offended" when I correctly pointed out everyone around was served first although they ordered after I did. Not worth it at all, not even if the food was good, I 've been to gourmet 5 entrees top restaurants where I've already been eating within the first 20 minutes. Ridiculous and I would give them zero stars if that was possible.<//Review><user_id>116373998825986006224<//user_id><pictures>None<//pictures><time>1433987884065</time><Rating>1</Rating><user_name>Julian Rodriguez</user_name>< Resp>

Our server was very nice. But we waited over an hour for our food. Without a visit from management.  After 45 min we had to ask about our food, because another table that ordered after us recived their food first. Of course they were very apologetic but did nothing to try and fix the problem. We were not offered a salad or soup on the house, or even a discount. Very disappointed with the back of the house and the food was just okay.< /text>

Definitely a great place to eat with good food. Prices can get a little pricy but I also went around Comic Con. Atmosphere is awesome though, much more of a rustic cozy atmosphere.<//Text>

<Review>AVOID THIS PLACE.  This place serves the worst food that I have ever had . Only the restaurant name is Italian, the food is horrible.  They have no idea how to cook pasta or what is a real prosciutto di Parma. The prices are extremely high and the staff has no apologies for plates that are collected with the meal intact.< /Review><Rate>1< /Rate><name>Mauro Loda<//name></record></dataset><record>

Lasagna was okay...Sauce was too sweet.  Service from one below average.  Another server had to help us out to get some parmasean.  On the good side, portion was large and salad was good.  Fyi, a la carte menu.</Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>We ordered Chicken Penne and it came swimming in cooking oil.  We only ate the top half where the oil had drained away a bit.  Worst Italian meal ever.  In addition waiter tried to rip us Aussie tourists off by charging 18% gratuity as a line item in with the items ordered, and then giving us a bill with provision for adding a tip based on the previous total  (and suggesting additional amounts between 18 and 22%) . A total tourist rip-off, avoid this place at all costs.<//review><gmap_id>0x80d9535a41d0ede9:0x9c1f64babc8424b4< /gmap_id>< Pictures>

Very lovely service, especially for Comic-Con when all hell breaks loose in the Gaslamp. However, their carbonara, well, isn't. It was tasty, but it ain't carbonara. And a little over priced for the overdone pasta that we got.
They have an excellent wine list, and like I said the service was great.
I'd go back at a less busy time to compare, but I won't be ordering the "carbonara" again. Lol</text>

<Text>Went for breakfast. I'm sorry to say this place was suggested by our hotel. The service was sloppy and the food arrived cold. We asked that it be returned to the kitchen. When the plate came back to the table there was no bacon, it had been forgotten. We had to wait for everything; water, coffee, sugar, cream and so on.Toscana was a big disappointment. There so many other choices downtown.</Text>< user>

Worst service ever!
The hostess was super rude. We went for breakfast with a baby and there were balloons by the entrance. the kid wanted a ballon and the hostess said -No, and if you don't like it there are many places in gaslamp to eat breakfast.

One of the servers apologize and brought a ballon for the kid. The hostess came back and took the ballon back.

The food is good, but where is the customer service?!?!!?!</Review>

(Translated by Google) I ordered a plate of "carbonara" pasta ... the photo says it all ... what else to add?
Of "Italian" they have only the sign, for the rest you eat badly.
My girlfriend ordered a dish of "lasagna" ... disgusting (obviously left on the plate).

In these cases I would do like Checco Zalone in a movie ... I would remove the Italian sign that attracts tourists ... but that of Italian in food has nothing to do!

TO AVOID!

PS .. and here you have to pay 15/20% of "tip" (the classic "tip" - otherwise you get offended ... as well!) .... and in Italy instead when we go to a restaurant and really eat Italian food ... we are all with short arms and we do not leave 1 euro tip!

(Original)
Ho ordinato un piatto di pasta "carbonara"... la foto dice tutto... cos'altro aggiungere?
Di "italiano" hanno solo l'insegna, per il resto si mangia malissimo.
La mia ragazza ha ordinato un piatto di "lasagna"... disgustosa (ovviamente lasciata nel piatto).

Io in questi casi farei come Checco Zalone in un film... rimuoverei l'insegna italiana che attira turisti... ma che di italiano nel cibo non ha nulla a che fare!

DA EVITARE!

P.S... e qui bisogna pagare il 15/20% di "tip" (la classica "mancia" - altrimenti si offendono...pure!).... ed in Italia invece quando andiamo in un ristorante e mangiamo davvero cibo italiano... siamo tutti con il braccino corto e non lasciamo nemmemo 1 euro di mancia!<//review>

(Translated by Google) Delicious eaten and shame about the lesser reviews because they are unjustified.

Other well-rated places are the many for few places. Here you just get good and tasty food for the right price.

Heerlijk gegeten en jammer van de mindere reviews want die zijn onterecht.

Andere goed beoordeelde plekken zijn de veel voor weinig plaatsen.  Hier krijg je gewoon goed en lekker eten voor de juiste prijs.< /Text>

I would say this is like your average dispensary with some extras. Clean, nice staff, and good customer service. Decent selection of glass pieces and different paraphernalia accessories. Great selection of clones. Also, I really appreciate how the prices listed online include tax. I'm a stoner not a mathematician and it makes my purchase easier to put together when I know exactly what I'm spending as I'm spending it.< /Review>

Big shout out to Cannavine they might be an upscale fancy dispensary but they got something in all price ranges and include sales tax in price. Had one issue with a purchase and they made it right which is humble of them in my opinion. They also carry Darkheart Clones one of the most highly regarded genetics companies. A couple other brands they carry that I like is redwood remedies and connected. Good variety of everything and always got specials. Online menu on treez is updated. Go to Cannavine or go Home<//Text>

Very helpful and professional staff, the online ordering system is top of the line and the store feels clean and welcoming (unlike some places that have a warehouse/ turn and burn feel or they treat you like a stranger every time you go in).

I was greeted with a smile and by name the other day even though I had let an order linger longer than I expected... I was treated like i had been coming here for 10 years when it was my very first time ordering with them and I created several headaches before I even made it to the store! Didn't matter. They were happy to help me sort it out.

They definitely earned loyal customers from me and my wife. Very grateful for their service and help. Thanks guys!</Review>

Never hit this dispensary. First California dispensary I've hit and will never hit. I was asking about how they do the process and was being rushed on how my purchase. The lady asked my 3 person group bc her boss was behind her tapping his watch threating her job if we were all purchasing. Remind you my whole group has a few hundred in our pockets because we our on vacation looking for a good time. So, if you want to know federal rules and know the process of grow DONT stop at this place. WORST SERVICE EVER.<//Text>

I didn’t feel comfortable going in and everyone being able to see me as you first walk in. The place is lit up great however it would be nice to go inside and have more privacy. Customer service was great. I liked the variety.<//Review>

I was impressed with the cleanliness of the establishment. They have a good selection of vape cartridges.
The only thing I was disappointed 😞 in was that I bought 6 cartridges and wanted 7 if they would charge me $25 for the 7 th one.  So no budging there.  So I bought the 6 - but come on a little break on the 7th? Didn’t happen.
Had they budged I would give it 5 stars but no so 3 stars.</Text>

I received a text from this dispensary with a list of clones available at around 10am. A few hours later I drove 30 miles to get the MAC specifically... the bud tender pointed to a van outside where the clones had not been unloaded yet and said “it’s 4/20 bro”. It was around 1pm by then. My point is don’t advertise something when it’s not on the shelf. Complete waste of time and gas.< /Review>

Whoever the girl was working Saturday April 17th at around 2:00pm; your demeanor was very rude, I work on a farm and it’s your poor attitude that really ruins a farmer’s hard work when people are just asking you about the product. Won’t be back.<//review>

Love that this place is affordable and also is starting to deliver to Lake County, there are a few issues with the online ordering that resulted in me being charged more than I originally thought because some  erroneous discounts were applied. Also I hope for a little more interaction from my budtender rather than getting handed a bag and waiting for cash, yes I ordered online and came to pick it up but engage with me, sell me on something you really like! At least make it inviting for me to ask questions. Also the rewards points system is a bit confusing, how are they’re redeemed or what they’re used for isn’t ever explained during the order process</review>

Your store feels so clean and your staff make it easy to order and to buy. The last time I was in, I was a little uncomfortable with another customer who wouldn't adjust his face mask to cover his nose. Your staff let me step outside and gave me curbside service. I really appreciated that! The only thing I hope you do in the future is an upgrade to your website. I love ordering my gummies online, but I need to see the ingredients first. I wish I could get that info from your site.<//text>

I came in first grabbed papers and knew what i want but the two people behind me got served first. The budtender was a man with dark hair and a goatee, wasnt friendly and when i asked about the weed he seemed to offer little knowlege, only that they grew outside, no terp knowledge. Look its a good dispensary if youre looking to get in get out but it was my first time and as a medical patient i was let down.< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>So my hubby called about sales tax and the girl who answered didn’t know she said it all on the website.  We went in the next day and had to wait in line outside for 20 min. We were not greeted by the door man at any point. When we got in the large lobby that looks like a doctors office and a window with a person behind it, No cannabis in sight. There is a dry erase board with their “daily specials” that’s hard to read it’s so crammed with info, a small tablet that I guess is what we are supposed to use to “shop” which was not cleaned after the previous customer used it. When we asked if we could see any of the product we were met with “uh, well, um, maybe, sort of, some of it” I asked if I could see the Ounce special for $130 which is what we came for. She went in back and brought back some nasty looking schawg weed that no club anywhere should be selling, let alone for $130. We walked right out, went up the street to Revolution Emporium and scored some Chronic half ounces and quarter ounces for just a few dollars more with 7 and a half % sales tax.  They obviously care about what they sell and the customers spending their money. I will never be shopping at Cannavine again and if you want good weed and a good experience with knowledgeable staff Who makes you feel like they care, I suggest you go somewhere else too.</review></record>

I really like the esthetics of CannaVine, nice layout, and friendly front room staff. The ladies in the back, are a different story. On two different occasions, and with two different females in the back room, I felt I was an imposition asking questions about products. They were very short with the answers they did give me. Not much small talk either.<//review>

I like this place, amd I don’t like clubs much at all. Good choice of flower, great choice of concentrates, all in all a good spot for quality products. Piggy bank returns for return customers, I had a good amount saved and did not even know about it lol. I was stoked when I found out. Best in Ukiah IMO.

<Review>When signing in I was made to wait at the window while the desk person looked online to see if they had I products I was coming to shop for and I wasn't allowed into the dispensary to shop like other guests. Just stand there like a fool. If I wanted to shop online I would not have dragged myself all the way there. They certainly killed my desire to ever visit again as there are other well run and friendly dispensaries near by.<//Review>< response>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Text>Second time in a dispensary, picking up a product for someone who knew what she wanted so it made it easy, especially with such a friendly staff. It was extremely clean and I think because of the COVID-19 it was a very brief visit and everything was done thru a glass window with some pictures on a computer of their product compared to the other one I had visited where everything on was on display in cases. It was fast, easy and good prices. Definitely will go there again when need be.<//Text>< pictures>

Staff is always very helpful and kind, I never feel rushed or intimidated like I have in other places. Only reason I didn’t give it a 5 is because they don’t have much of a variety of edibles, which is what I go there for most of the time. What I have bought has always been satisfactory though!< /text>

Awesome prices! Tax is already included in the price! So cool!!
Great location and employees definitely.
My #1 dispensary to go to!
Really fast and the products are displayed in a way that makes it really easy to find what you want and the budtenders have great suggestions every time.
They have online ordering. Wish they took debit cards.
Definitely worth to go and check it out!
Thank you guys at Cannavine for the 🔥 products always! *BACK 2021 WITH THE SAME OPINION ON THESE GUYS!*</review>

Very classy place. I liked the menu, though I wish it had a bit more info about each strain and product. But I appreciated that the menu was kept up to date, and had pictures. Everyone was super friendly too. I definitely recommend this dispensary.</Review>

After visiting all the other dispensaries in the area, I have found my jam spot! Great deals daily on the best flower and concentrates in Northern Cali. They run big deals on my favorite brands and always have some new when you feel like switching it up. I’ve been going to this place weekly for months now and have never had a bad experience, the owner/manager and employees are amazing and knowledgeable, the security guys are always cool yet professional. I normally don’t leave reviews but honestly this team deserves it.</Review>

<review>I'm not very happy about the current restrictions but its understandable and if we all work together, we can get thru this. The online system and processing on-site works fairly well. After commenting about the staff's lack of friendliness, I noticed a recent improvement. That goes a long way with ppl! Faculty is VERY clean and nice, modern design. Keep improving and expanding your line of products! Thank you for your service!

Suggestion: When there's a long line, expedite the process by having the person who sits at the door, get the info regarding the order for the next customer (while the current customer is inside) in line and pass it to someone in the back, so the order can be brought up front for payment. Staying one step ahead of the customers is better customer service! You have the technology, just organize your employees.  Don't keep us waiting, especially when it's hot outside. THANKS!< /review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Your dispensary has great product but honestly the guy who was doing the front on Sunday June 14th basically ruined my birthday! He gave my friend the wrong gram and for the rest of the drive to Fort Bragg she and I were beyond beyond upset, couldn't get over how horrible his customer service was! He made it seem like we couldn't even look in the bag to make sure he had our orders right or not, so of course it wasn't until we were on the road again that we knew of this. With this pandemic going on and not being able to go in the back and actually look at the product; the person who is able to, should pay attention to what is going on more so than not! Other than that the product is really good...
Sadly though since I am from out of town, I'll probably never go there again when passing through. First experiences are everything, it would have been different if I was from up there and could give them another chance but since I'm not... won't waste my time again, I'll check out the other dispensary!< /text>

I had never used a dispensary before, and even though marijuana is now legal without a medical script, I still felt a bit awkward and nervous going into the business. Cannavine employees immediately put all my fears to rest. They were friendly and professional and very helpful in making my experience a positive one. I now confidently go online (10% discount!) and order all my goods. They email me once everything is processed and ready for pick-up (less than 30 minutes everytime) and I have the reassurance of knowing I can run by there when it is convienient for me and be in and out in less than 5 minutes. Also they have a very customer-friendly, yet absolutely safe, process for operating during the current Covid crisis.< /Text>

<text>I don’t often write reviews, but Cannavine has earned it! It’s just overall the best dispensary around, when you take into consideration selection, atmosphere and price. Not the biggest selection but definitely the best selection, all the products at Cannavine are things you want. Products for all budgets, the 2g/$60 live resin deal is unbeatable and they have a good selection of prerolls. They also have a nice little selection of glass if you want to save a trip to the headshop. Clones too! They also will text you the deals each week if you choose. Always someone to open the door for you when you arrive which is a nice touch, and the staff is always friendly and professional. My only criticisms of Cannavine are that they broaden their selecting of edibles and work on accepting credit/debit though there is ATM in the lobby. An overall great and well run business in Ukiah, thanks for being here!</text></record>

Really embrace customer service. I mean some shops try. This shop succeeds. Some of the most interesting/quality strains available in this area. I can honestly say I went to every single shop on 4/20 and this place was the best investment. They really care about their customers. You will enjoy what you invest here and the product is worth that investment.</review>

{'time': 1567463918312, 'text': "Negative reviews from another shop owner( Russ Green/Kure wellness) is often the sincerest form of flattery, but getting your employees to do the same is just lame in so many ways. In such a small community we should bring each other up and not  focus on tearing each other down. Don't really understand all your hostility either. You applied for a LA application right? Our ownership is at the shop 6 days a week. Our roots run deep within the Emerald triangle for many years, and will continue to build our reputation throughout this community. We commit volunteer hours to the city, and try to help in as many ways as possible. Our commitment will be seen just like the community educational expo we put on at the senior center 2 weeks ago. We will continue to do the best we can to bring our members a experience we are proud of while not putting down other folks in our community. We have never and will never do what you just did to another shop. Hey Russ.\nThx for the review though, we must be doing something right!\n\nNEW REPLY TO REDONE REVIEW: Russ thanks for reducing your original 2 star to a 1 star!  Calling us out for writing fraudulent reviews 3 months after we called you out, and your employees you got to write reviews is once again LAME! keep writing these reviews my friend, they only help us.. People see through your non sense.  We have addressed this and have no other issues with other shop owners so why would we pick on KURE?  We called you and asked kindly to take down your reviews then you had the audacity to write your own review? 3 months later your still not over it and redo your review! LMAO Maybe your 1 star reviews are real? ever thought of that? I see you get people to review us a 5 star and you a 1, but this has nothing to do with us buddy! We don't play these games. We focus on us and only us. So sorry you feel some type of way. Again thanks for the kind words and letting us know we are doing something right though!"}</response>

They bring in the best products at the best price, the budtenders/managers/ security do they're best job to give the best experience possible for their customers, I've seen their employees even volunteering at different places around town, they're definitely doing their part as a community.. Not only does Cannavine have great products and excellent customer service, they also make it a priority to help those with MEDICAL needs! I sent my dad in there for his back pain needs and he was so impressed by the CBD products they had. Does his back hurt anymore? NO.

<review>Was looking for CBD products preparing for an upcoming surgery. One of the BEST shops I have been in as it was light, airy, products all over, and a very knowledgable staff. Will have to tell my Mom, who just successfully finished Chemo but still has lingering side effects, about your store as well as bringing my hubby in. Thank you for my Baby girl CBD.

To come into the dispensary in the state of California you must be 21, or have a doctors recommendation. In this case you were under 21 with no doctors note.  Your ONAC card is not a recognized cannabis perscription.

{'time': 1570212801042, 'text': 'Hi beverly,\nFirst off sorry about your expereince with any of the flower we carry. Prop 64 has made it impossible for us to actually look at each bud.  Everything is lab tested etc, but sometimes as you can see things happen.  This can be handled pretty easily. Just come back in with your product and we will get you a fresh one.  Assuming you got purple punch from Flow Kana. The price point of $30 dollars which is I believe the most reasonably priced Flow Kana eighth in the state.Its not quite a year old but it is getting there. That being said if your looking to buy sun grown in early October your not going to get fresh sun grown. That is about a couple weeks away.  We encourage you to come back and allow us to fix your issue.\nThank you,\nTeam Cannavine'}<//Resp>

< Review>
When I moved to Encinitas I went to 4 different groomers trying to find one as good & accommodating as the one I went to for years in San Diego. So disappointed....  I was about ready to make the drive to SD every time my dog  needed to be groomed. Then a friend mentioned Dog n Suds. Denise & Darcelle & their team of groomers are dog lovers who just seem to work their magic every time with my Schnauzer, Beau. Thank you! Aleana & Beau<//Review>

<username>casandra tompkins<//username><Rate>5</Rate><date>1621926353182<//date><pictures>None</pictures><Text>After taking my 8 month old ShihTzu to two other highly recommended grooming businesses that I was not satisfied with and felt were overpriced, I looked over the recommendations on Nextdoor and tried Dogs In Suds. I was immediately pleased with their prices & the fact that they offered a la carte services instead of me always having to pay for a full service when a full service wasn’t always needed. I also appreciated them listening to me explain about my dog’s anxiety and history as a mill puppy and that I had just re-homed him about 5 months prior from the elderly couple who bought him from a pet store. They genuinely seemed to care that he had been through a lot of homes and he was still a puppy.

The first cut wasn’t exactly as I would have liked, but that was my responsibility for not communicating better what it was that I wanted. The second cut was fantastic. Exactly as I explained. Every cut since then has been awesome. Each time we arrive at Dogs In Suds my dog is pulling on the leash excited to head back to the grooming area. This never happened at the other groomers. We are both very pleased with Dogs In Suds. I always enjoy visiting with the other customers outside or on our way in or out. The owners, employees and customers are all very pleasant there.< /Text>< userid>

We're super helpful and friendly. Everything went really smoothly, my doggie was not stressed out and they got her nails super short. 😁 Plan to go when her nails get longish again for sure!!</Text>

Dog in Suds has been the only groomer we’ve used for our Labradoodle. They have been awesome, especially Cindy! We wouldn’t go anywhere else. The haircuts have been exactly what we wanted and our dog is always happy to go in for a grooming. I highly recommend Dog In Suds. Make sure to ask for Cindy!<//text>

<Review>Recently moved to the area and needed a new groomer for my dog. Although there are a good amount of 1 star ratings I thought I would give them a try since their overall was a 4.0 rating and to be honest there are not a lot of small business groomers in the area. The people were very friendly and the groomer asked and listened to what kind of cut I wanted. When I picked up my dog she had one of the worst haircuts I've ever seen her get (and there was only one other time I felt this way about a cut my dog got). I’m not picky at all and usually don’t mind a little bit of choppiness cause it just grows back..Her body looked uneven which was pretty bad, but I could see past, but her face was SO CHOPPY. I had to use my husband's clippers to try my best to fix it. It was that bad that I felt the need to fix it immediately when we got home. Her cut was nothing like her head shape too! She looked like a different dog. They cut it short down the center of her face then longer around the sides like she had a middle part. Her ears weren't even trimmed..I'm not sure if I got someone new. I love supporting small grooming businesses and the people were very friendly, but for the price (which was a bit higher where I usually go to) I don't plan to ever go back. I really contemplated calling to bring my dog back to have them try to fix it, but decided I didn't want to risk her coming back worse. I want to add that my dog gets tons of cuts (every 3 months) so I know she is good when she gets groomed so I'm not sure how she messed up so badly :/ she is a Pomeranian poodle mix, but her hair is like a Pomeranian. Lastly, I dropped my dog off at 12 noon and they told me she would be done at 4pm which is long for a cut. Places like petco take 4 hours and I know they leave dogs in crates, which is why I only go to smaller grooming businesses that usually only take 2-2.5hours so I was already hesitant. After 4 hours I don’t receive any call that she's done and the store was closing in an hour. I finally call and the woman on the phone immediately says “oh, she's done”..I don't know how long my dog was just waiting there because I never received a call and I don't know how much longer she would've been waiting if I never reached out and called myself... also, usually the groomer will hand you your dog at the end and personally thank you, but she didn't. Someone else brought my dog out..I usually never write reviews unless a place is outstanding because great businesses deserve great reviews or unless my experience is horrible enough for me to want to warn future customers. A one star rating is brutal, but it is a reflection of the experience I had :/ seems like others can say the same ...< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80dc0b8602b1576d:0x55ebf1160b91e3a9< /gmap_id></record>

I took my dog here for the first time and when I picked him up he wanted to get out of there. I took him home and that night he didn't seem himself. The next day when I put his collar on he yelped. I felt his neck but he wouldn't let me touch it. That night I was massaging his back and he yelped again and was not himself. I thought he must have gotten hurt at the groomers. I called and left a message with the receptionist but nobody called me back. Then today I took his collar off again and he yelped so I took a deeper look and found punctures wounds on his neck and his back. So apparently he was attacked at the groomer. I thought it was odd that the gal that groomed him saw me st the dog park the day after and never said anything and she knows me and my dog. Now it all fits. Needless to say, I will not be going back there.< /text>

I was also worried that he would be miserable during the experience and freaked out. Well when he came strutting out at the end of the day, I couldn't believe how cute he looked! He was beaming and knew he looked so cute. It took years off of him and he was much more comfortable.  It has grown back and I am so excited to take him in this Friday.

The best pomeranian hair cut around!  Dog in Suds groomers are the best.  I've been taking my dog to them every other month for 13 years and for 3 years before that with a different dog. Darcy is always loving to Teddy Bear. Now Teddy always gets stopped when we are on walks and told how adorable he is.  They do a perfect "puppy cut" . Thanks Dogs in Suds for being great to my fur babies.</text>

<Review>DO NOT TAKE YOUR PETS HERE!!!

I dropped my dog off at 12(noon) and was told to pick him up at 4pm. They usually take about 3 hours to groom my dog.
They called 1 1/2 hours after I dropped him off to let me know he was done, and that his right eye was swollen. I was shocked to hear this because he was fine before I dropped him off. The whole morning he had been playing and seemed very happy.
When my husband went to pick him up, he was told they called me before they started, to let me know they noticed something wrong, but I never got a call from them. Both my phone log and theirs confirmed only one call was made AFTER the grooming was complete. My husband rushed him to the vet. He was shaking and very frightened. That night he was very lethargic, obviously in pain. Now, days later, is eye is still swollen,  and not fully back to normal.

Now the owner refuses to pay for the vet bill!
DO NOT TAKE YOUR PETS HERE!!!

Our two dogs get their claws trimmed here, and we've never had a bad experience! The owner and staff are all great, well trained, experienced and caring. Not like the well meaning but not very learned teenagers who do the work at some other chain stores in town. We are in and out in no time flat, and they are always accepting and gracious, even when I walk in 15 minutes before closing. :)< /review>

BEWARE!! Overbooked, rushed, late and smells like must... but most importantly they will BUTCHER your dog's doo. They have horrible customer service that trickles down from the owner, Renee, who not only offered no apology for taking my Newfoundland's silky 6 inch coat down to a half inch buzz cut...she actually blamed me. I was clear and specific in my request for a 2 inch off the length cut and ended up with a buzz cut that was a disaster. All I see is chopped lines from the clippers. They couldn't even do a smooth buzz cut!  My dog's nose also came home bleeding like crazy from the crate. I wish that I could post pictures to this sight to convince you to go elsewhere. I understand that mistakes happen, but when the owner goes on the offense and denies any responsibility nor offers any apology...that  definitely questions business ethics. I also just realized that they don't ask for any vaccination records as most groomers do. Is that against the law? Trust me, Dog In Suds is a disaster waiting to happen<//Text>

I brought in my dog here for the first time.  She was returned to me with a swollen eye, and bloody nails.  They don't take any responsibility when your pet is injured, and also deny any wrong doing.   The owner even gets mad when you complain and claims you don't know what you're talking about.  When I give my dog over to a facility and they return with a bloody paws and swollen eye, and the business doesn't even notice it until you point it out. . .this is surely a place to AVOID!!!!
My dog is like my child and this place just doesn't give a hoot!  Go there at your own risk!< /review>

<review>I have used Dogs and suds a few times and my experience has been OK. Today I dropped my dog off and they told me it would be $90.00 but when I picked him up it was $100.00 , They had no explanation.  The cut looked awful, very spotty.  I had asked them to leave the fur on his head and just blend it in to a Summer golden retriever cut but they shaved most of the head at a very odd lenghth..   This will be my last time going!< /review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80dc0b8602b1576d:0x55ebf1160b91e3a9<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I tried several other groomers before I found this place.  I have two frisky West Highland terriers, and I've always been happy with the service at Dog In Suds. As for price, they're lower than many other places--this is an expensive area and rents on storefronts are outrageous. Thanks, Darcy and Denise!<//Review>

Stay away from this shop. They are rough with the dogs, and do poor work. Our dog would hide under the bed whenever we brought hime here. He has never, ever done that since we left this service provider< /text>

This parking garage is someone hidden. If your not paying attention or if you haven't been here before you'll simply won't see it. Parked here on a sat and headed over to olive garden which was just across the street. This place is hidden inside a huge business type building as well but it's on the first floor. Parking was free at the time we parked but i believe it's less then 2 hrs. Don't remember.<//Text>

I usually park here if I'm going to the Apple Store, H&M or anywhere in that particular area. This lot does get full quickly so go down the street to the schoolhouse structure off Green st if you can't find a spot.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Text>It is always nice to have a free parking (first 90mins) in a shopping area. The only thing was, I was literally less than one minute late (my ticket showed 15:39 and I got out at 17:10) because of the car ahead of me moving very slow, but that lady wouldn't let me go and insisted me paying for the next hr. Yes I was "late" and she was doing the "right" thing but that made me feel uncomfortable.<//Text>< Pics>

As a local Pasadena artist, it was a pleasure to collaborate with the team on a last minute mural art activation for this year's Rose Bowl.  Their staff are amazing to work with and highly professional.  They worked tirelessly to make sure they have a safe and seamless event this year.  We look forward to partnering together on future projects.  Thank you to Brittany & Alyssa for being the best employees & going above & beyond for the events!  We hope that 2021 will bring some better times and look forward to hosting the Rose Bowl back home in 2022!<//Text>

<rating>5</rating><review>Been in LA for three months and have to say this was one of the most spectacular things I’ve experienced.  Growing up on the east coast, it was a family tradition to watch the parade on New Year’s Day.  To get to see it in person was something I’ll never forget.  Everyone was so festive, friendly and the floats exceeded all my expectations.  Thank you Pasadena!<//review>< Pics>

Have you every watched the Rose Parade on New Years morning.  Well the Tournament house is where the parade begins. The Tournament House offers free guided tours every Thursday at 2 pm and 3 pm.  The tour leaders are well versed in the history of the Rose Parade and Rose Bowl.  They also share some very interesting and humorous stories about past parades and games.  The Tournament House was formerly owned by William Wrigley and his wife.  The Tournament House is also known as the Wrigley Mansion.  Your tour starts with a video history and proceeds up to the second floor.  The tour takes you into the Queen and Princesses suite and then descends to the first floor living room, dining room and entry hall.  The entry hall has a pipe organ that is still operable.  This is a hidden gem in Pasadena and a must see.< /Review>

Such an incredible sight. We were lucky enough to be chosen to help with and repair a float as they line up for the parade, after making the trip from their warehouse. It makes for a really long night as the floats start to line up around 10 PM and then bunch up at 3 AM. But you get to walk the line and see them all early. I was surprised at how many people were still walking around at 3 AM.</review>

<Text>Yes, it seems very pricey; however, the experience is unbelievable. The excitement that I could never get from watching TV. Definitely want to do this once in my life time.

Parade starts at 8am; they suggest you arrive by 6am. Finding parking structures can be challenging since many streets are blocked. Wear comfortable shoes, because lots of walking!!

It is very cold in the morning, wear layers!! They allow food/drinks, just not bottles. There are security check points. There provide portable restrooms too.

Overall, fantastic experience!!!<//Text><gmapID>0x80c2c382a53a1c99:0x9d3a194b00cc237e</gmapID><user_id>112509210362668820607<//user_id><pics>None</pics><Time>1531456935677<//Time>< name>

OMG you HAVE to see the parade in person!  The floats are so much grander than on TV, and you don't have to listen to the commentary!  Be sure you also take the building tour.  It is amazing to see the detail involved in building these beautiful things.  The horsemanship in the parade is also amazing.  You miss a lot of their tricks on TV.  The bands are also very good.  Many of them dance and do  aerobatics while marching/playing that isn't caught on camera.<//Text>

<Text>Wow, amazing I live in Pasadena, work and went to school there, but I didn't know about it, until I went back for the Rose parade & someone told me that all the floats will get in position and line up in the order they will go in the parade the night before @ about 10:30pm until the early morning hours, but there were many people came to have a first look at the floats, security there was absolutely great, well Pasadena is basically a crime free city. But the security told me I can set up my tent where ever , not only that I mentioned because the long travel I haven't eaten anything, I asked if there a place I can go to eat, they give me food. The preparation for the Rose parade was on going for the whole night, there were so many interesting activities. A night I will remember for the rest of my life. Awesome place to go to, I strongly recommend it.</Text>< Response>

<review>For the past 5 years we have been going to the Rose Bowl Parade, and we love it. There is truly nothing more exciting than sleeping on the streets and walking around at 3am in the morning and watching floats go by past your house! Also they close down the streets and you can ride your bike everywhere you want. Kids spray silly string ELSEWHERE! Its just so fun.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I was on the Torrance Rose Float in 2012 and  watched the float twice.  Riding the float and decorating the float is an awesome experience.<//Text>

I have taken FREE tours of the Tournament House every summer since moving to Pasadena and each time, I learn something different. When you take a tour, you'll watch a quick video, and then be lead by a volunteer through almost all of the rooms in the house. It is really amazing to see construction and features of this old home.

The Tournament House, located what was known in the early 1900s as Millionaire Row is the official headquarters of the Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association. It has some paid staff, but is largely operated by volunteers.

Chewing gum magnate William Wrigley Jr. purchased the home in 1914 for $170,000. It was one of their vacation homes.</review>

I decide to pick Rose Parade.  It is my first time attending this very popular event, living here so long yet it is my first time.  This year rose parade is the 125th anniversary. It has a lot of variety of float from local city, Nonprofit, University, to Private Corporation.

One of my concern is the parking, surprise it was not really an issue.  Our group didn't get there until after 7am,  we were able to find a good parking spot about 3 blocks away which is about five minutes' walk.  It was a lot easier compare to the site when they park their float after the parade.  Which is far harder to finding street and they charge money for nearby parking and admission.  While the parade is, free!

Even though we only got here one hour prior the parade, it was not too hard to find a good spot to see the parade.  Advice brings a [portable folding chair.  Don't bother bring a mat is quite dirty in the street thanks to many camper who often do not take care of their own mess.  Make sure bring a camera and a tripod if you really into photography.  Camcorder would also be handy.

This year float was overall average; the only stand out float that I was impress is the Honda one.  Huge bullet train alike got a giant camera too.  The one thing you do not see in close up float is that there is marching band and of course, the military planes fly-by. I wish they would add some speaker or a least an apps that allow you to hear the live coverage so you would get to know the history of the float while it passed by.  There is one thing you do not see in the TV is the army of cleanup crews after each group of horses pass by. Some of the float equip with music was a nice touch.  The reality show Voice also got a voice, which was a surprise.  There was several winner singers present in the float but none of the judge. Vin Scully the voice of Dodgers was this year Grand Marshal.

Overall, I do think it was worth my time and was long overdue seeing the rose parade.  It was not as crowded and actually pretty well organized in most part.  I think the grand park downtown countdown has something to do with reduce crowd.  Anyway, this is a one thing you must do to when you visit or live in L.A. or in SoCal.  It is only kind in the world in this scale.   @~)~~~~< /text>

Can't share because ended up walking out.  Everything is always great. We were were seated out in the patio and waited 15 min without once ever being acknowledged.  No one offered drinks, chips or salsa.   Will give better rating when we go back and hopefully better service or at least acknowledged.  We ended up at Mountain Mike's. Always great pizza.< /text>

Food was decent, a little expensive for the food you get but good flavor. The guacamole was tasty 👍🏽Service was not that good in my opinion. Employees were professional and nice but our table did not get checked on very often. We asked for certain items and just took long to get or didn't receive it. The ambience was actually nice! They have TVs and very good music selection 👌🏽 nice bar with great lighting displaying their bottles🍾< /review>

We had the best service from Mayra she was so attentive, and took really good care of us. The Michiladas are Huge,, food was shareable portions. GREAT atmosphere.  Patio seat was hot but they had fans blowing on us.
Thank you!<//Text>

The food was good. The music was blaring loud. Asked the waitress to turn it down three times. She said she would and didn't. We couldn't hear ourselves talk and we left for the headache. I talked to the manager afterwards and all she said was I'm sorry. I'll never go there again!</review>

<Review>Ordered curbside through the Yelp app.  Food was ready on time, and though the first time we called we couldn't get through, the 2nd time they picked up and brought the food right out.

We ordered green chicken enchiladas and red cheese enchiladas.  Both were great, as were the beans and rice.  The beans had some magical pork flavor in there.

We've eaten at both their locations now and will def be back.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrPyy6GGJyGbgZDlR16jtzhGGgRrw4OJOsJYry=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMiLeUtI8fpRYjYlrYngj1tdlBrCzsJRwbE1Mm3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80dccd4afbf02e85:0xb7c09b314310b128< /Gmap_id></record>

<rate>5</rate><review>Ok I admit it. This is good. I like all 3 salsa choices.
Tortilla soup is very different from most other places. It's very Chile based and delicious if you like anything like enchiladas sauce.
Tacos durados good.
Fajitas good. I didn't want flour or corn tortillas
Wet tinga burrito good. They call their shredded beef tinga I guess. (Mi familia taught me something else for tinga.)

Take out took a minute when I ordered in store, but I see online ordering available. Patio seating available with heaters.

Part 2
Been here a few times now. They're back to indoor seating as well. We have taken multiple family here. Most everything everyone ordered was well received. This place is highly recommended.</review>< pictures>

The food was great but a little overpriced and not to fast service but it is fine. They have a big bar with a great variety of alcohol. I got the menudo which was very delicious and comes with your toppings. This place is great<//Review>

"1st basket of chip's w/salsa is on the house."
Really?? Is this a new normal for Mexican restaurant's due to COVID? Overpriced for the quality of food that you get and the service was painfully slow.
In the staff's defense, there looked to be only one waiter handling all of the inside patrons. I receive my meal close to 10 minutes after the rest of my party. My meal was a "burrito bowl" that looked like, and tasted like Kirkland canned chicken breast that they threw on the grill to sear. The beans were cold and looked like they were right out of a Sun Vista can. The rest of my party had similar opinions of their meals.
I would not recommend this restaurant.<//Text>

I give up!
I'm not going to go here anymore I've been complaining to the owner, the managers that they charged me to put cheese on my tacos I keep telling them I'm not getting cheese I get like three sprinkles of cheese no matter how much I tell them nothing's changing it's not worth it to me to not get my cheese when I'm paying for it. I'll have to find another restaurant they don't seem to care. Last time I talked to the owner she assured me should be talking to the staff I went again this week same problem even told the girl when I was ordering it to make sure it had cheese gave her a tip still did me no good.<//Review>

Only complaint is the margaritas are small for the price and my wife said not that good.  So because if that I had to do 4 stars.< /Review><gmapID>0x80dccd4afbf02e85:0xb7c09b314310b128< /gmapID>< Resp>

<Text>This may just be the best mexican restaurant this side of Puerto Nuevo. The food reminds me of Ortega's Patio, but much much closer to home. Great job on the food and service tonight Casa Diaz!</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Been there twice during Covid and I love the food, but hate the flies. Inside the actual restaurant is beautiful. Great decor, very fresh and modern look. Great bar area and music is not bad. The food is amazing especially their Barbacoa Tacos dipped in consome caldo. I tried there potato tacos too and they have flavor to them. They also have a kids menu. Price wise they aren't the cheapest but their serving sizes are not bad. They have a good taco Tuesday deal too.<//text>

They have some of the best food in Chino and some of the friendliest staff. Our server, Cory, went above and beyond to make our experience memorable. Cant wait to go back.< /Review>

Finally a great mexican restaurant in Chino. The restaurant was packed on a Friday night @ 9 pm. The hostess and waiter were super friendly and customer service oriented. Chips came out hot and crunchy, and salsa was good. At our table we ordered a grilled shrimp burrito, carne en su jugo, and a mango cart on tap beer.I am not often impressed with mexican food, as many times it is not flavorful.  What a surprise. The burrito was amazing, just tasty and bursting with flavor and spices. The grilled peppers and shrimp were grilled to perfection. The carne en su jugo was extremely flavorful. Meat was tender. This is definitely a go to place for a great tasting mexican meal.</Text>

This review is for our take out experiences. All I can say is the food is delicious!

The enchiladas rancheras are spicy and have the authentic, home made flavor I love. Their Casa gourmet al pastor tacos we great, and the fajitas are delish as well. We have ordered twice in one week it's so good!

We ordered through Postmates the first time and did pick up the second. They have a patio areas for dine-in and we are going to give it a try soon. We just moved to area and knowing that there is such a great place close by is awesome :-)<//Text>

This place has seriously good Mexican food. 2 dishes in particular are worth the visit - Carne en su jugo & Casa grande burrito. The Carne is an absolutely delectable beef stew absolutely brimming with flavor and hearty goodness. This is one of the best Mexican dishes north of border made in a restaurant. The burrito is also no joke, they pack it with your choice of 3 meats and chipotle flavor and it is HUGE. If you’re someone who likes big burritos, I can confidently say you don’t know what you’re talking about until you’ve had this one. It needs its own special extra long to-go container and can easily be split by two hungry guys. Everything else is standard fare but quite well done. This place deserves a visit.</review>

<text>Where to start...lets see.
When I first entered the restaurant, I asked the hostess lady if i can dine in and she said yes. 5 mins later, i walked back inside and she asked me if i can eat outside patio. I said yes...she guided me there and placed my menu on the table. I found what i wanted to eat, but have not got any service for 10mins. On top that,  there were alot flies on my table and decided to walk out. I complained and yold the bartender that the service was horrible. She then reply saying that she thought that i was waiting for a table. The nerve of this place. Not coming back.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<review>I really wanted to like this restaurant, especially with it being so close to home. We eaten here between 5-10 times, all take-out orders aside from one instance (pre-COVID 19). I'm not kidding you: 50% of our take-out orders are incorrect, one time my shrimp tacos only had 3 shrimps total! Each time we've taken it back and they gladly fixed our order, except today. My husband ordered for our family, and I picked it up on my way home. When I got home, the burrito had onions and cilantro...which I cannot stand! I tried calling Casa Diaz beforehand, but was on hold for awhile. I decided to just go down and explain what happened, messed-up burrito in-hand. The waitress went over the order, but she had written it down incorrectly. She didn't want to remake the burrito, and I would need to pay for another one. I told her she could keep the burrito because I wasn't going to eat it, and explained to her that the restaurant always mixes up our orders, so not sure why today was any different. She just gave me a blank stare. So my advice: check your orders before leaving. I wish the business well, but will not be back.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< gmapID>

Update—called the restaurant today to have them  reverse charges on my credit card.  Their response was that they didn’t know how.  Are you kidding me????  Who does business like this?!!</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Poor customer service. If they seat you outside, they are planning to forget about you and your family or give you chips and salsa in the next 20 mins. My hopes where high here but being outside in the sun with flys on my arm and legs and not being acknowledged. Not thanks. Casa Diaz sucks.< /Review>

I never stuck with working out until I started at DIAKADI over 7 years ago. The atmosphere is perfect: never too crowded, and everyone is friendly but focused on their own thing. They have every piece of equipment you could imagine, all well maintained. I really love the food bar too (during non-pandemic times) - the smoothies, bars, and other grab and go stuff has really saved my behind when I was low on calories and in a rush! And my trainer Shelby is the best: she really understands my needs and has helped me achieve specific goals over the years.<//Review>
</record></dataset><record>
<Review>For me health and fitness is closely incorporated with life, faith and mental health.  Diakadi and my trainer always make me want to push.
With a very focused tone and clear objectives,  I find myself not even thinking just going to the next exercise.  There is a difference between performing from admiration, intimidation or fear and performing based upon an absolute belief that you and your coach are aligned and have a mutual focus and respect for goals and success.

Whether the success obtained is actually, or an unintended benefit against a team of two focused on a goal, aligned in purpose and achieving daily success I can’t determine.  I never hate it, I never want to give up, I never need compliments, nor feel like I have to perform, I just do. I’m unconsciously inspired resulting in purposeful performance. I feel like a team and I don’t want to let down my partner, don’t want to not carry my load, don’t want to lose the respect and momentum of a team with an objective.

My Trainer Tycho Berquest<//Review><Rating>5<//Rating>< Resp>

< review>
This is a San Francisco gem. You will not find another exclusive training gym like this place.

The amenities are spacious upstairs with clean women’s showers (can’t speak for the men). The equipment is clean, up to date, healthy snacks and awesome hours.

This is a client-focused gym—meaning that if you want to get away from crowds (who never put equipment back) and, if you don’t want a scene—then this is the place to get serious. This is were you seriously go to get 1:1 training or small focused group fitness like Paul Wright’s Get Wright Bootcamp. The trainers are even-keeled, conscious and knowledgeable.

The downstairs area has the right mix of lighting and sound baffling that you’d expect from the upstairs space which is airier.

Update: parking but best if you walk or bike to get trained. Diakadi has a nearby lot: “has eleven reserved marked spaces (22-32) just for you located at 2226 Alameda Street,” which is only steps away and safer than street parking.< /review>

< Review>
I am a coach at DIAKADI and their new outdoor space is absolutely INCREDIBLE. I am so thankful for their quick change in location so they can continue to provide the HIGHEST quality environment for me and my clients. DIAKADI has always provided a top notch experience for me as a coach and for my clients and the new outdoor space is no different. We have access squat racks, DB’s, resistance, stability balls, bikes, you name it. All while having PLENTY of space to feel safe. My clients are LOVING IT and I’m so happy to be back working with them. Thank you, DIAKADI!< /Review>

DIAKADI was the best place to work and workout before the pandemic shut all fitness facilities down. Now the outdoor space is absolutely fantastic! It's extremely safe! We're all wearing masks, ample space to keep our distance, cleaning of equipment between every use, and in the best part of the SF for great weather! I'm always in a better mood after working out at DIAKADI Outdoors! I highly recommend it! Tell your trainer about it and bring him/her along! If you don't have a trainer, contact DIAKADI and they'll hook you up!</review>

<review>I have been coaching here in San Francisco for over fifteen years. I’ve had the honor of working at many top notch facilities, working with professional athletes, D1 football players and some of the most dedicated clients and athletes that a coach could hope for.
Out of all the amazing facilities I’ve trained clients, DIAKADI is hands down one of the best gyms / performance centers I’ve been lucky enough to have coached for. Owners Billy and Mike have put thousands of hours building their dream gym and their hard work is evident in this masterpiece of a gym.
Here are my top five reasons you should consider training at DIAKADI.

1. Best Coaches in the Bay Area with continuing education requirements that exceed the national standard for coaches
2. State of the art training facility with updated state of the art equipment ranging from Olympic lifting platforms, kettlebells,to Kaiser functional cable machines with power metrics to train explosiveness.
3. Clean facility with amenities such as laundry service, meal preparation and a no crowd policy ensuring you will hardly wait for any equipment.
4. Spacious! DIAKADI has two floors both with a long turf grass for challenging drills like sled pushes, drags, battling ropes and all types of agility drills.
5. Community, I’m proud to be a part of this family. Both clients and trainers all make up this positive energetic space. Everyone feels welcome and our front desk team are seriously the coolest nicest people you will ever meet.< /review><name>Ross Steiner</name>< gmap_id>

<text>DIAKADI is more than just a gym. Way more. It's a family. I wish there could be a DIAKADI in every city in the world, because that's how incredible and special this place really is, not just for clients who are looking to achieve their goals, but for coaches who are trying to be the best in the industry. The DIAKADI team has truly raised the bar in the fitness industry and I can't think of another gym I would rather train at.</text></record>

< Review>
been an independent trainer at DIAKADI for over nine years, for me it is without doubt a second home and a second family! From being greeted by the happy, smiling faces of the girls and guys at the front desk, to working amongst some of the most knowledgeable trainers and coaches in the world, it certainly does not feel like ‘work’ training my awesome clients at this facility. In regard to the facility itself, I would describe it as First Class, there are two huge floors with every piece of fitness and workout equipment imaginable, which enables me to keep my clients both interested and challenged. In addition, the staff do a great job of making sure that the gym is never too crowded, we are never waiting on apparatus or equipment and always have a comfortable amount of space to work out in. Without doubt 5 stars all the way!<//Review>

DIAKADI is a true gem in SF. I'm the type of person who's always thought "I don't need a trainer, I know how to lift weights". I bet many of you reading this might feel the same way. Let me tell you - it's worth it. I learned SO MUCH and had a great time in the process. Switch your mindset a little bit, and think of it as an education as well as fitness. Or an investment in your health. You'll learn SO MUCH about how to train your body safely. As someone who's struggled with lower back pain for years, this was really helpful for me.

The trainers at DIAKADI are absolutely spectacular, and they've each been vetted by an extremely professional and experienced staff. I worked with Kelly and would highly recommend her. Anyone who' has made the cut to become a trainer at DIAKADI is worth your time. Each trainer has their unique focus and experience and DIAKADI is wonderful about matching you up with someone who fits your specific needs. This is not a "one size fits all" training gym.

In the time of COVID, this place has also gone above and beyond to create a safe space for fitness. Honestly, right now is a great time to focus on health.

Simply put, there's a reason that this facility is so respected in the fitness community. If you care about your health and you value functional strength and fitness, then this is your place to make it happen.<//review>

Diakadi is an incredible place because of the beautiful facility, master practitioners, dedicated staff and leadership from its owners.

The gym has a complete arsenal of equipment, tools and resources so that any client has what he or she needs to execute workouts, receive therapy and achieve goals. From private treatment rooms to olympic platforms and traditional strength training equipment to athletic turfs, Diakadi hands down has the best personal training facility in the Bay Area that is even superior to most commercial gyms.

There is a diverse selection of coaches and therapists who are all extremely passionate about their craft and who make up Diakadi's community. Each practitioner pursues education and mastery in whatever niche they gravitate towards and this ensures that no matter what your goals are, there is someone who is the perfect match to guide you on your health and fitness journey.

As a facility, Diakadi is run extremely smoothly and professionally and this has not changed one bit due to Covid. The expert staff have adapted so that there is temperature check upon entry, requirement to wear a mask at all times, reserved session slots to prevent overcrowding, spacing between practitioners and clients and other sessions around them, tools for cleaning and disinfecting, mandatory cleaning periods and the list goes on. They have seamlessly made this version of training in the gym the new normal, and all without losing the warm and welcoming atmosphere that makes Diakadi what it is.

Finally, none of this would be possible if it wasn't for the direction from Billy and Mike, the owners of Diakadi. Billy and Mike are the masterminds who, over the years, built Diakadi from the ground up, designing this beautiful and complete space and gathering intelligent and passionate individuals who make up their staff and practitioners. But all of this is just as impressive as their perseverance and leadership during these hard and trying Covid times. While most small businesses in San Francisco and around the country fought and still fight to stay open, Billy and Mike unified training studios in the city through the San Francisco Independent Fitness Studio Coalition (SFIFSC), their organization to help gyms rise up together and prove that it is indeed possible to keep gyms safe so that people can prioritize their health and fitness. When they were struggling to keep their own business afloat they didn't just look out for themselves - they decided to help save San Francisco's entire personal training industry.

If you are looking for a place to begin working towards your health, fitness and life goals surrounded by a community that is knowledgable, experienced and driven, then look no further. It is an honor and privilege to be a personal trainer and bodyworker here at Diakadi.</Text>

Diakadi is such an amazing place. It's a huge relief to be able to train clients inside again, and this facility takes their safety measures very seriously. Diakadi has been the gold standard for gyms for a long time when it comes to personal training, and they continue to be so now during the pandemic; rigorous safety measures, excellent cleaning protocols, and top of the line equipment and staff. I've felt absolutely comfortable since returning to training inside, and all of my clients feel the same, and it's 100% because of how great Diakadi is at managing this new normal. If you have any hesitations about training inside, Diakadi can absolutely help put them to rest.<//review>

I love training at Diakadi Outdoors!  I’m able to work out on the same equipment that I used at the gym, but outside in an extremely safe environment.  From the moment I step foot at Diakadi Outdoors, I get my temperature taken and am asked a series of health questions.  All the equipment is sanitized after use.  Everyone is wearing masks and appropriately social distancing.  As someone with a healthcare background, I understand the importance of safety during this time, and I can attest to the fact that Diakadi is going above and beyond to ensure the safety of everyone who steps foot in their outdoor gym.</Text>

<text>Like many others, I was distraught when Diakadi was temporarily closed due to the San Francisco Department of Public Health's order in response to COVID-19.  But.... THEY  HAVE RE-INVENTED THEMSELVES in response to COVID-19. Yay, yay, yay!!!

For the past 3 weeks, I've been attending my training sessions at the Diakadi Outdoors facility in Mission Bay with great joy! They provide appropriate screening, ensure compliance with masks and hand sanitizing and it feels VERY SAFE!   It is so good to be able to have sessions with my trainer again and  to use some of the equipment previously available at the gym (cleaned after each person's use) and NOT worry about COVID exposure.

The outdoor facility is great: turf instead of grass (love it - no mud) and plenty of space for social distancing during your sessions. Parking is also available at meters or for a small fee in the adjacent lot.

If you are looking for a place to resume your exercise routine / resistance training,  Diakadi Outdoors is definitely the place to go!!</text>< name>

Excellent facility with outstanding trainers. Everyone here is friendly, encouraging, and personable. Refreshments are top-notch, with meals available in-house for a quick post-gym boost. Equipment is always available and high quality. Nothing is overlooked here. Only wish there were more open gym hours, but the focus is on training (which is worth every penny).</review>

<Review>I've been working at Diakadi as a trainer for several years now, and I'm crossing my fingers to call it home the rest of my career.  It can be intimidating to walk in because it's such a great facility, but from the moment I reached out to the Diakadi team, they made me feel welcome.  Every trainer here strives to be the best in their field and are all so dedicated.  And I can't say enough good things about the full time Diakadi staff.  They have helped me grow my business beyond what I thought possible and have supported me in every way possible.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1570051313186, 'text': "Natalie!\n\nThank you for taking the time to write your DIAKADI Review on Google.

< Review>
My wife and I had the pleasure of training with Carlos Solis at Diakadi. The thought of personal training felt daunting and intimidating at first, but after our first session with Carlos, those concerns quickly went away. Right from the beginning Carlos made sure to create the right routine for our needs. He has a calm demeanor, good sense of humor, and a very easy-going personality.

You can tell that he’s passionate about what he does, and often provided us with useful tips and insights on how to improve our diets and lifestyles. With every session he would push us to work harder, and made sure that we had every technique locked down. Very quickly, we could feel our bodies getting stronger and our energy improving. Even on days where we were tired from work, we looked forward to training with Carlos. It’s unfortunate that we had to end our training with Carlos after moving out of the city, but we would highly recommend him to anyone that may be considering a personal trainer.<//Review>

The paragon of fitness & health! Not only is this facility inviting, state-of-the-art, and stylish, but it also is home to the most knowledgeable, professional and dedicated trainers in San Francisco... Maybe the world.

This is the best gym in SF. The facilities are clean, there’s parking nearby, and they provide clean towels and sandals and showers. Plus if you sign up for laundry service they’ll keep your gym clothes clean for you so you can walk in and out without having to lug clothes and gym shoes around.

The best part is the trainers. I’ve worked with Zach Scioli and he covers everything from diet to sleep to guiding you through a rigorous workout tailored to your fitness level and goals. He helped transform my health.

I’ve also worked with Nate Miyaki and he’s super knowledgeable and fun to work with as well. Every trainer has a different approach, but I’ve found that Diakadi’s trainers are more thoughtful and comprehensive in their approach than anywhere else.< /text>

<Date>1504451732235< /Date><rating>5<//rating><Review>I had hit a plateau. I didn't have motivation anymore to workout. I had been relatively "in shape" but a lot of the muscle and definition had gone away. I needed to be motivated again. I needed to find out how to workout differently so it was interesting and exciting to me again. And I wanted to look a specific way, aesthetically again. I communicated this to Diakadi, who did an excellent job of recommending three trainers to me as options. I interviewed all of them and in the end settled on Joe Andrews. Results? 3% drop in body fat, almost 3% gain in muscle mass. I had obliques again. I had abs again. I had arms again (with veins popping out in places I'd never seen before). And I regained my energy, motivation, and confidence again. I felt proud to take my shirt off again. Can't say thank you enough to Joe who was absolutely amazing. He listened to every word I said and customized a very specific workout. He always helped me keep my eye on the prize. And kept the right balance of patience, along with pushing me and my body. Two big thumbs up. I've been maintaining what he built with me, have been working out 4X a week now with his lessons and recommendations, and will be starting a new workout package with him in October because he was THAT awesome. Ahhh yes, and the facility? Excellent for client to trainer 1:1 workouts, and the management and staff is terrific. Recommended 100X over. DO THIS if you've hit that plateau and are looking to make a successful change. Diakadi and Joe gave me my groove back.<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>Nice little shopping center to pick up prescriptions, grab a bite to eat and buy a few groceries in one stop. Pool place here is really good, too! Corner store (opposite end of SBs needs a solid tenant) Hopefully it'll stay the same business as there have been several over the years.<//Text>< Pics>

This shopping center is truly an all in once STOP. Whether your needs involve banking, hair cut, groceries, pool supplies, dentist, urgent care, medical reasons, pharmacy, or eating out this is definitely YOUR PLACE. This center also has a smoke shop and a massage place. And let's not forget American Tires every time great prices and pleasant friendly employees.<//review>

In helping his clients make the right choice for their car and their needs. I learned more about tires in 5 minutes with him then I have in 50 years dealing with all the other vendors buying tires. He is the go-to man to get it done right at a good price.<//Review>< Pictures>

Good shopping center has places close by to eat fast food and a restaurant. Even a bank and gas station in the same area, also little stores. All together a good spot<//Text>

The village has a great number of stores. Gets congested at times with traffic because of location and narrow lanes plus sharp turns. Other than that, great shops. Donut shop, tire shop, grocery store, bank, fast food, dry cleaners, and sushi.</Review>

No smile or warm welcoming from her just silence and rude expression on her face. This is the 3rd time i come in with my child on a different occasion. They need to get rid of her or put her in the back. Her customer service needs work. Other than her everything else was GREAT.</Review>< Pictures>

They have lots of places to visit in this little shopping centre. Had sushi for lunch which was well priced and the food was amazing. Then went to GMC to get some vitamins. Staff in there is very knowledgable and they don't rush you. They take the time to talk to you about products. Then we got taxes done at Liberty Tax Services. People in there are great. So helpful and really know their stuff</text>

It has a little of evrything from grocery stores, drugstores, clinic, ice cream shop, donut shop, jewelry store, wells fargo inside Stater brothers and bank of America. You can't miss the fast food places since they are street view. Oh and almost forgot the Sushi place and many other stores. Americas tire is there, convenient to drop car off for whatever is needed and a massage parlor and Nail place next door to kill some time. Ok went a little too long here, hope it helps someone out.</text>

A lot of businesses packed in here. Everything from radio shack to a smoke shop, a recycling center, a huge medical group including an urgent care clinic, and a supermarket just to name a few.
WARNING: Parking lot is very busy {watch out, pedestrians!} so don't always expect to park close to your destination.</text>

This Marketplace is decent. We really only visit it for Carl's jr. And Stater Brothers. Where is Applebee's that is okay from time to time and the Valero gas station is awesome! There's a Bank of America and a tire shop and both of those are very great. There's some itty bitty shops at a sushi place and they're all mediocre. I believe it's Central Medical which is there and in my opinion the only good about it is it's urgent care. The Rite Aid in this market place is terrible. It smells and the workers are absolutely terrible. I don't know what they clean with but it must be dirty water from the streets.</text>

One stop shopping that is close to home. I use this shopping area often...in no particular order, CVS, C.C. Smoke Shop, Cinco de Mayo Restaurant, a Mexican store, Little Cesar's and Jack in the Box. The Village is easy to get in and out of and I am able to get a lot done.< /Review>
