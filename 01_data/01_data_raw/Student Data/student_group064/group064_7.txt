Picking up the car was a great experience. I was in and out in less than 10 minutes. Everything is online so there's no massive amounts of paperwork. Returning the car was even easier. I will definitely be using Enterprise again. My only complaint was that the car wasn't cleaned inside or outside. During these times it's extra important to clean the cars between rentals. We took it home and cleaned and vacuumed it using sterilization cleaners. Hopefully going forward they'll do a better job of getting them cleaned up.</text>

<Review>I had an excellent end to end experience with renting my car from the Brentwood location.  They were fast in getting me the car and on the road.  The best part is the customer service that went above and beyond!  I left some medicine in the glove box, contacted and spoke to Mario.  He understood the importance, contacted the next renter of the vehicle and arranged with them to overnight my medicine back.  This was incredible and I really appreciate the efforts behind this.  I highly recommend using this location and will rent from them going forward.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Based on my experience, I think Ryan Howard should run this branch. He was considerate, attentive and went above and beyond to make sure I was taken care of. As busy as it was, I was in and out of there. Because of Ryan, I will be using Enterprise when traveling and I travel often! Thank You for superb customer service!!< /review>

I had a situation where the vehicle style that I’d  reserved was unavailable. The staff were prompt in alerting me to this well in advance, offering me a vehicle with a higher daily rate for the same lower price of my original reservation.

The vehicle was clean, and upon return they even double checked that I hadn’t left any personal items behind (garage door opener, chargers.) They offer a complimentary shuttle service as well.

Thank you Brentwood Enterprise - I will definitely be back!<//text>< name>

Disappointing. I was given a car that was not washed. The California registration tags were expired, putting me at risk to get pulled over and have an unnecessary interaction with police during this unprecedented time. I was required to use a credit card when the policy online said I could use a debit card. I had to go to the bank more than once to make a payment because the correct amount charged to my card was not disclosed initially< /Text>

When it comes to getting some help via phone it just looks that they cannot find information in their system, kind of frustrating!

Oh well, I just got another problem ! the manger at this place is super lazy he could not even try to get my information but he keeps charging credit card!

Too bad the only worker there who actually worked (Kate) has moved to another branch.

I will dispute the charge as this local people are useless.<//text>

It makes no difference to make a reservation for the second time I've shown up and there was no car for me. I'm a loyal renter but that doesn't seem to make a difference. When you reserve a car and pick the car that you want confirm it twice at that car will be there and you are sure that will be there and then it's not it's very disappointing. I do not think that I will be a loyal customer to this vendor anymore unfortunately.< /text>

<rate>5< /rate><text>I have chosen Enterprise as my go to rental for both business trips and personal. My recent rental happened to be personal with family. My experience reminded me why I have chosen Enterprise over other companies.
First impressions are everything and the first phone call just to inquire about a van was a good one. The person on the other end was very friendly and professional. We were directed to our local Enterprise after we made the reservation. Knowing we had a long drive ahead of us we wanted make sure they had a van suitable . We called and asked if we could see what they had and a very helpful young lady explained that they were out being cleaned and serviced but we were welcome to come by later and see. I went down later that day and the same young lady greeted me with such a friendly and professional demeanor . From start to finish Cassie Coble made the entire experience easy and a refreshing change from the usual poor service I’ve come to expect from younger adults these days. Even checking up on us during our trip making sure everything was going well.
I don’t write many reviews and in part this is a review of Enterprise  .But  it really is due to the fantastic service we received from Cassie. A smile and a hand shake are something a lot of people overlook these days , well that with the professional attitude goes along way with me.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

The manager Mario and the manager Cassie in the Brentwood office made sure I received my rental  vehicle. Also I  want to commend both shuttle drivers with the Antioch branch.

Sitting in an extremely busy Brentwood office understaffed.... but the star of the day is Cassie who is answering phones, checking folks in, cleaning cars, and doing it all with a calm and collected attitude.  Those of us waiting  (10) for cars are waiting patiently and marveling at her composure
Under difficult circumstances.   She knows her stuff and should be given a bonus for her efforts!<//text>

<Review>Rented a Nissan Pathfinder. An hour into the 7 hour drive down I5, no cruise control. Sensor would shut it down, and only way to 'reset' was turn car off. And in 5 minutes, it would shut down again.

Essentially, no cruise contol.

Branch manager, Cassie, made it TOTALLY right when I brought the suv back.

I mean TOTALLY right.

Definitely a loyal customer to the Brentwood branch.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Prices are out of this world. Plus if you want premium car or truck, Yikes they ask for a credit card on file ,and in insisted that any other car you only need,Debit card. Kinda annoying considering the new gal rang me up for a premium priced car charged my debit car and then gave me a baseline car. Come on seriously!! $400 for 2 days. For an impala. I'm not impressed.< /Review>

First off, the staff were wonderful and the car was new, clean and comfortable, but........
1)Apparently they have a limited number of cars at this location. I had a 4:30pm reservation and had to wait for a car to be returned and cleaned. I didn't get on the road until 5:13, making me late for my 6pm engagement.
2)The tiny hole in the wall office was packed with people waiting for cars to be returned and cleaned. Only 6 chairs and people standing in this HOT tiny office.
3)The parking lot is also tiny, shared with 3 or 4 other automotive businesses. When I returned the car, there was only one spot to park in in front of one of the other businesses, no signs not to park there, not blocking anything and I was yelled at by one workers for parking there.
4)When I returned the car 3 days later, the staff were very nice and clearly busting it out with what limited resources they have, but again, the office was hot and packed with people waiting for cars to be returned and cleaned!! How sad and frustrating. I feel bad for the staff and all the people waiting, who's time is very valuable!</text>

all employees working that day were super helpful and friendly. I appreciated the phone call asking if i needed a ride. The ONLY issue i have is the car this time and last were really dirty when i received them. The fun part about renting a car is having a car that feels brand new. Also,
the last two times I have been charged more than i thought. The second time it was adjusted. The location is perfect for where i live. Just wish you guys were open on Sunday so I didn't have to go elsewhere if i bring it back on a Sunday.<//review>

<Time>1450470410949< /Time><text>Truly excellent service!

Reserving a car online is a breeze. Working with the front desk personnel is actually fun, as they're both VERY professional (and super-quick considering the possibilities for "complications" if one is using a debit card) and extremely friendly and helpful before, during and after the process.

DO make a reservation (online or by phone) before just dropping in, if at all possible, as that further smooths the process nicely for everyone.

The "Weekend Special" Period (end of August to middle of May) is a fantastic deal, ask about it, and the Enterprise folks are really happy to see the smiling faces of those of us who enjoy their great deal.

Keep up the great job, you delightful auto lender-outer-ers (!?), and may all your clients appreciate your hard work dealing with <gasp!> "The Public"..!!  :)<//text>< rate>

I always rent using Enterprise, but my first using this office.  The best thing about this office is that they open on Saturdays, which is perfect and convenient for me.  The bad about it are 2 things:
1- Their cars are outdated, old, and not the same quality I would find somewhere else.  They were able eventually to accommodate me after I was about to be downgraded for the same price.
2- Delivering the car back was a nightmare, my experience with all rentals is that returning the car is a max of 5 minutes deal.  With this office, I spent more than 30 minutes.
I will rent from this office again only when a Saturday is a must for me, otherwise, it will not be my place to rent, inspite of its convenience distance wise.< /Review>

< Review>
Worst customer service I have ever had in my life. After having to take 3 Uber back and forth I finally have everything this woman wanted she tells me they are sold out and the 15 cars in the lot are for upcoming customers. Mind you this is for an insurance claim. The manager is rude and she shouldn't have a job. I will make it a point to share my experience with everyone I know. I contacted district manager hopefully they can resolve this matter</Review>

<Review>i am a habitual last minute renter at enterprise brentwood (norcal). as i am constantly on the move, my travel plans are sometimes riddled with mistakes, like with my reservations. the manager helped straighten out my wrong day reservation and we were able to get on the road within minutes. while we did not get the usual economy car or the typical hybrid upgrade, the vehicle  we drove was a good compromise. pretty good staff,  great customer service,

Great customer service at the Brentwood, CA location.  Selection of vehicles at time of service can be tricky - they are a small facility and do not have a large selection of cars. I requested an intermediate SUV (like a Nissan Rogue) and got a Jeep Compass - which is sub-standard to a Rogue... The Jeep has sluggish acceleration, a low-rent interior, small cargo area & below-average fuel economy. This was on a Tuesday at 1pm - they not only had no other comparable SUV's, they did not even have an Intermediate or Full Size car to trade out to (that has more trunk room than the Jeep Compass!)  This was a week rental for our anniversary trip, so was disappointed.  I rented the car a day before needing it, and in the 24 hours prior to departing, no other cars came in, acquired or offered to obtain the driving experience hoped for. But the people are super accommodating and apologetic.</Text>

1) Will not allow a way to have an actually conversation with a person prior to service.
2) Does not return phone messages
3) Barely responds to messages on text
4) Took ownership of a Model 3 5 weeks ago, third time for service because of total computer failure
5) Under no circumstances will they give you a loaner, that is only reserved for S and X customers.  They can keep your car for 3 days, under a warranty repair, and you will have to get yourself transportation
6) They might be able to provide charging, provided there is not an S or X in need of charging
7) They do not give you repair updates when promised
8) Basically, if you want very little service, save yourself 40K and go with a basic car company or spend approximately the same and go with a luxury brand that knows how to treat customers and retain business.<//text>

I've so far worked w Nick, Chris, and Steve and they're all professional and helpful. Overall I'm very impressed and would recommend this location because of it's ability to resolve all car related issues with ease and a short wait time depending on what being worked on. This is my first Tesla and for sure won't be last due to the great level of customer service I've received. Thank you Tesla Van Nuts Team!</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPralthuw0C0AhNeOxEX6pDc9m3vV_YMhGykxAq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6TnjcWd8M9yFrBgn0Aj_6prucZ1Teb35qRco2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQsav6ZqFRNfjRbABp-naNS5wlDExDKIychZO2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Response>

This is my 5th time at this service center because they can't seem to fix my Model Y. Every-time I go in there is something new they they caused. They installed my glass top incorrectly, which caused water to seep through and caused water damage to the interior. Now today I go in and they scratched my doors. I waited for an hour for them to "check photos" to make sure they did it. This is getting frustrating and ridiculous. Also goodluck at the Burbank one too because they dented me car there too. I bought a Telsa thinking I was going to get quality.</Text>

<review>Everyone I've dealt with at Tesla Van Nuys has been a pleasure to deal with. In particular Michael H helped make sure my very detailed complaints with my new Model Y were addressed and fixed. Yes it's true service can take awhile here and at any Tesla service center, but this location has been good about giving loaners for long services partnering with Enterprise. This time I had a Land Rover and Audi Q7 from while I waited for the car. This place is absolutely better than the Burbank location.< /review><GmapID>0x80c299e46e632eed:0x972336ad934a385a</GmapID>< Rate>

<review>Sadly got a brand new Y and it came with the original defects they all come with. Setup an appointment after two weeks to install homelink and take care of the internal panels issues. Advisor, a young lady, rudely addressed me in quite a dismissive fashion. Took the car at 10:45am on Tuesday telling me it would be ready on Wednesday by end of day. I was already surprised by the longer than expected timeline. I was provided with a Uber digital voucher and explained that I needed the car By EOD on Wednesday. Sure enough the car is not ready and I was greeted with a “not sure what to tell you” I now need to go out of town and they would not provide a loaner or rental reimbursement. I had BMW and Audi and this is not the way to service a $60k car owner.   Tesla possibly need to learn customer service skills and procedures or is it limited to this service center?
Not sure but not a good way to start my Tesla Experience.</review>< UserId.>

I didn't feel like I was rushed out the door like most service spots. Waiting room well equipped, soda water coffee, sofas. Clean bathrooms. All in all I'm definitely conning back. Btw the keys were made in a few minutes. It took me longer to drive here than what I waited lol.

< review>
my advisor, rachael, and anyone else I have interacted with here so far have been great. however, I highly advise you DO NOT WASH YOUR CAR there. my 3 month old baby is scratched up after servicing. I returned with the vehicle and it was sent for a full detail off-site but some scratches remain. we are currently exploring alternatives as I would prefer not to repaint a new car. hopeful my options will prove a positive outcome.

will update in a few weeks. customer service has fallen flat on its face. I have not heard back from any of 4 email threads since.

*Update*
Over a year later and still unresolved. I went in over the weekend and no managers were available. I forwarded the year-long email thread to staff on site who then forwarded to his manager but neither has replied since. Very poor customer service from this brand all around. Once they have your money (vehicle purchase) you are worthless to them.</review>

I have visited this service center with both my 2020 Tesla Model S Performance and Model 3 Performance. They are very punctual and very understanding. Most of my complaints were resolved and for the one issue I had to return for the team was very empathetic. Joanna is a rockstar and has always helped me get my issue resolved and get on my way. My most recent visit was during the Stay At Home order and my issues were resolved safely and without a hiccup. This is my go to service center!</review>

Tesla is a great EV choice.  Service gets the job done.  They are new to vehicle maintenance and EV service is a bit different.  Cars only need tires, brakes and minor maintenance, not even annual.  One item of note, they stopped offering vehicles for service and giving Uber credits.  When I picked up my vehicle, Enterprise was there saying some repairs do get rentals.  Service is very busy and had a short wait to be helped.</Text>

I’ve had several cars over my lifetime and have visited several service centers. This was by far my best experience! Roberto and Nick were super knowledgeable and helpful. Even though I bought my car used, they didn’t make me feel like I wasn’t their priority. Thank you!!</Review>

Note to anyone considering taking their Tesla here. Fernando and Nick are no longer here. Instead, they have been replaced by a horrible service manager (Aaron B.) and an spineless service rep (Roberto) who is afraid to speak up in front of his manager.

<date>1563525725555< /date><rating>1</rating><text>This is where my car was delivered.  Never communicated or heard of Robert the Delivery Experience Specialist but first time we met him while waiting for my car, he barely touch our hands to shake or made eye contact then ran like he was having bowel problems and ready to go.  Luckily Mitch the Delivery Orientation Specialist was very engaging he made our day and made us feel like we won our car.  We love Mitch. We've always had some minor issues here whenever I get my car service. We'd brish it off.  When we needed maintenance, their communication was weak, I asked for a rental car while they take care of mine. The day I got there they did not have a car available saying they did not receive the message I requested a rental car, instead they called Uber for me. Fine, I let that slide.  People who actually handle your car are very welcoming, most of the people on the desk, not much.  What took the cake was when a rock hit my windshield where it went from a pinpoint crack to a 3 inch crack.  scheduled an appointment for a replacement which took a couple of weeks, then they contacted me few days before the appointment to take pictures. Okay, done.  Finally the day of the appointment, I get a call saying they don't have the part and will have to wait when a windshield is  available. Took them A MONTH to email me to contact collision service myself to make the appointment where at that time the crack on my windshield has become more than 3 feet long.  I tried contacting them within that month if a windshield was available. No response whatsoever finally I gave up on them, I found an after market windshield and went from there. I am not going back here anymore. I'd drive an hour long to go to Costa Mesa to get proper service than come back here.<//text>< pics>

<Review>Tesla has work to do with the service department, but they have been working hard at it.
So far, the Van Nuys location has always done right by me. The car is fixed and within the timeframe they have told me to expect it.
Communication is good, but the response to text messages could be a little faster at times.

The staff has ALWAYS been friendly and pleasant to work with.</Review><user>104528645454473724661< /user><rate>5<//rate></record></dataset><record>

My service center specialist, Nick, was extremely helpful in getting my minor issues resolved. I received texts on status updates on the car, which were great. The loaner car was also a great experience as driving around the Model S was a unique experience in itself. I hope Van Nuys quality of service and attention to ensuring customers are satisfied when they leave remains as steady high as they can achieve. All customers coming in won't like coming into a service center because they know it is out of their way and time to get something fixed. But I strongly believe after this experience, Van Nuys sets that bar on example of service. I am looking forward to recommending this location to Tesla owners if they are looking for getting their issues resolved and service.</Review>

I have a body shop and had to come to tesla van Nuys to order a bumper cover because you're not able to get a hold of no one on the phone or by email to order parts. I've been here for over 30 min and no one has come to take my order. What kind of service is this. Ridiculous service.</Text>

Their repair shop telephone line is a joke! The auto voice put you on hold forever, then it gets disconnected! I was holding for a over 25 minutes to speak with a service technician,  finally it rings. A male voice picks it up: "Repair Shop, may I help you?" then it gets disconnected. I call back, and other 25 minutes of wait, no-one picks up, then I hang up!  They make great cars, but can't handle a cheap phone system? Or they are cheap to hire more people to answer your calls?<//text>

<response>None<//response><review>I'm updating my review. After my bad experience with the windshield (read below) I now had a problem with the fan and was worried about bringing the car back in. The customer service was outstanding. They provided me with a loaner vehicle (much nicer than mine and the kids didn't want to give it back) and fixed all the problems I had listed with my car. There was a confusion when my car was actually completed and I ended up driving the loaner longer than expected but that was nothing to complain about! There was one part that was personally delivered to make the fix complete. I have never experienced such amazing customer service. Luke and Natalie are excellent. If you have them in charge of your problem, you will not be disappointed.

Old review: Don't get a cracked windshield. Their service department will not be able to get it repaired or provide an ETA and after a month of waiting for a new one, they will advise you to call Safelite Repair.<//review>< time>

<text>This service center is not well organized and the accommodation is very minimal.  I had an appointment and someone brought me in from the parking lot to "check in" with the 2 persons at the front. So, I sit and waited. I waited for an hour and someone finally asked if I have been helped.What's wrong with this place?< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

No real progress on the issues I brought it in for, since it was software based. But the service was excellent and I got a Tesla loaner for the day.<//text>

<text>Absolutely horrifying experience on the phone with Genesis. She called to tell me that my appointment was cancelled due to my specialist no longer being with the company. She continued to tell me that she could not replace my appointment for the same day and I booked this appointment 2 months in advance due to a trip to Hawaii. I was very upset that I could not have my same day due to my long pre existing appointment scheduling but I was open to coming in the day before and she proceeds to tell me that she cannot accommodate that either. “I cannot move a client, as they have scheduled appointments”  Ummmm you are moving me so yes you can move people right?? I asked to speak to her manager and she said that her manager is unavailable but she is her assistant..... so I asked when her manager would be available (Katie) and she said “I don’t know and I cannot disclose that information to you” Terrible assistant if you ask me that doesn’t even know when her boss that she “assists” will even be there. Worst service I have ever gotten. Overall I have had good experiences  at this location wax wise but I could not believe how I was treated by Genesis today with no consideration to accommodate me but everyone else with “appointments” must have their times despite my 2 month advance notice. Unacceptable...... Beware of this location if you are wanting reliably, accommodation and customer service.<//text><time>1622486383517<//time><resp>{'time': 1622519625427, 'text': "Hi Allyn.

I am Italian/Mexican decent and have always waxed my mustache. I bleached, then waxed and sometimes ripped off skin while doing it.  I am now 70 years young and guess what? I still wax.  Finding the European Wax Center was wonderful.  The "Blue" Wax is gentle (no skin ripping) and the technicians do a very excellent job.  It's wonderful not to have to mess around with home waxing.  It's totally worth the money.  It's very clean, professional and only 10 minutes from my house.  I tossed out my home wax kit and I'm never going back.< /text>< GmapID>

The staff at the front desk are always very kind and helpful. i appreciate how the front desk staff calls the day before to confirm your appointment and they are really good about scheduling when you need it. I only go to Lora since she is so wonderful. She is great to have a conversation with and she really puts you at ease on the more painful sections. She also does a wonderful job of making sure that she removed all the possible hair. All in all, I have had such a great experience that I don't plan on going anywhere else.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x809ade1af5137751:0x5bd1baa5e043921c<//GmapID></record>

I always get wonderful service here.  The employees are always smiling and helpful.  The waxer I use knows exactly what she is doing. That's why I always go back to her.  If I have to cancel an appointment or re-schedule, there is never a problem.  This European Wax Center is excellent and I have gone here for a few years now,  I highly recommend this Center<//text>

The staff is always friendly when I walk in and I go to the same waxer each time and she’s very detailed in her waxing which is important to me. I’ve been going here for several years now and I love the wax never makes me break out and doesn’t stay red or irritated all day like other wax experiences. The pay up front program for a years worth of services is so worth it too. Really great place!! And it’s located in a great shopping center where I can get other necessary shopping done as well :)< /Review>

<review>UPDATE: I was contacted a few weeks ago about the review I left below to see if they could make it up to me. Sure I'll give you one let try. I come in today and not only does she do the opposite of what I asked for she left a lot of hair behind. Why did I even bother coming in AGAIN when I was promised I would not be left disappointed? The waxer was very kind and apologetic but I asked to be listened to and I was ignored. Not okay.

Original Review: The girls at the front desk are very sweet. However, I was left with a horrible wax one to many times. I’ve been coming here for a long time and I’ve never been so disapointed. I was given a very uneven wax, which is now resulting in very uneven growth and ingrown hairs (very unusual for me) even after 3 times weekly exfoliating for years. I’ve been able to turn the cheek to their bad services a few times but as we all know waxing is NOT cheap. I will not return nor will I support European Wax Centers in general after this.< /review>< date>

<Review>I LOVE this place! The front counter ladies are very receptive and knowledgeable about everything. I've never had a bad experience. Ive had to reschedule 2 times in a row with no issues. Ive had 2 waxers due to my first one moving forward with her career and my second one is very nice. I have a 12 month pass or techincally 12 appts and bought that during their promotion period. I love their aftercare products as well.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>The front desk ladies are always very nice, and I LOVE my esthetician! Alexi is so sweet and personable, and I just love her attention to detail. I’ve felt rushed out by other places/people in the past, but never with her. She always takes her time and makes sure I am happy. Even still, I am in and out of there in record time, which makes me happy because I don’t want a wax to last any longer than it needs to (underarm and Brazilian). Love this EWC location and highly recommend!<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

< Review>
I live in Natomas, but I make the trip to Rancho Cordova because NOBODY waxes away my "beard and mustache" like Miranda! Whenever I leave, my face feels smoother than a baby's butt and --this is what's important-- that smoothness LASTS for two or even three weeks! I'd tried several of the other ladies before I connected with Miranda, and that's what you have to do to find the tech who works best for you. (When I m moved from RC to Natomas, I tried the local EWC, and wasn't happy with the results, so I decided to just bite it and stick with Miranda, instead of trying to fit with another tech.) All of the techs I saw at RC (four others before Miranda) were very friendly and professional. The place is always clean and they've FINALLY got a REGULAR front desk staff that is very pleasant (it wasn't always that way--there used to the a revolving door up there!), Cajun being my favorite.  Another thing I like about EWC is that they don't have some BS policy of charging you if you miss your appointment. And if you're running late, they allow you up to nine minutes past your appointment time before they just go to the next person--no big deal.

The only negative I have is that I didn't appreciate that they DO NOT inform you about the "touch up policy." If your hair grows back within a couple days after waxing, you can go in for a rewax FOR FREE. This is important to know ESPECIALLY when you first start waxing because the hair does grows back really fast until, as they explain, all the hair gets into a regular growth cycle. I always buy bundled packages (they call them  "Passes") and I was going back and USING my passes, because no one told me about the touch up policy until I complained to the Manager (who DID tell me) about the hair coming back too fast. So now YOU know.

Overall I love the place and highly recommend the RC location.< /Review>

I don’t know if there’s been staffing changes or what happened but the usual lady that is there hasn’t been there and it’s been someone different. I have not been happy with how my dog has been groomed. Also I was charged more than usual so that didn’t make me happy. I will probably have to start looking for a new groomer sadly because I am no longer happy taking my dog there.< /text>

<Review>I went to pick up my dog today and witness them being rude to a huskey who looked about three to four years with black and white fur. The huskey seem to not want to go in the cage and the ladies were very aggressive at him, trying to pull him inside and speaking very harshly to him in spanish. The dog did act out in defense and I believe nipped one of them in fear, The women push the dog in, one of them giving him a kick in the rear before closing the cage. I stood there in shock by what I just saw.< /Review>< pictures>

Great service. They treated Rocky (Husky) with great respect and groomed him very well. I don't know when was the last time my Rocky looked this good. I highly recommend to get your pet groomed here.</review>

<Review>The man who groomed my dog was a nice person,but he did such an awful job. I was extremely disappointed. I asked him to trim my puppy's hair and he even showed me the length it would be. He ended up cutting off way more. It was also a really bad cut. His fur was uneven with little poky pieces of hair sticking out in weird places, one of his ears looks bigger than the other because he cut more hair from one ear than the other, and his whiskers were taken off one side and not the other. It was awful, awful, awful. He claimed my puppy was squiggly, but I've seen my dog get groomed before and even at the vet he doesn't move an inch. My vet always comments on what a great puppy I have. This guy was just in a hurry and I really don't think he knows what he's doing. It's so sad, but at least puppy fur grows back. I'll never come back here again and would recommend everyone to go somewhere else.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80c291099d5864d5:0x8188e04a83439043</Gmap_id><rate>1<//rate><name>El A.<//name><response>None< /response><Time>1487399797183< /Time><user>106260049346601985667</user><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

Terrible service how do your prices go up over $20 in less then a month for the same service to the same animal. These people definitely got greedy. I will let everyone know to avoid these terrible people at all costs.</text>

<review>100% would never recommend this place to anyone. My puppy is full of cuts & hair is uneven. Not even close to the cut I asked for.
$55 for a job not even close to well done. Worst place you could take your dog.<//review><date>1542650717247</date></record>

<text>I Cannot emphasize Enough How Wonderfull the groomer &his staff (owner) are.

I travel about 20 miles to come here. That’s how great they’re.

Where I reside its very expensive to groom my dog. It’s up to $65 for a cut and wash.. & they’re not personable and kind to my dog.
Plus my dog doesn’t like going other place(most don’t) other than here at this groomer place in Pacoima.

Yes for many years I  paid a pretty penny to groom my dog but it’s more than Just a groom . I’d like to think  my dog is in good hands.

Thank you all here! Keep up the great work!

P.s Please Tip Well to your groomer!! (3/5$) on average...

UPDATE: I was stunned there prices went up Significantly... with in a couple months. Probably their rent went up?

I use to pay a great Price for my pooch (30 plus tip $35) now it’s up about $15+ for the same Type of groom.

Unfortunately I can’t afford this place any longer, it leaves me no room for tip plus the drive is more than 30minutes , with gas and all , it just won’t b worth it ... with this Price increase. Yikes..

I still recommend this place only bad is they have increased their prices too high and I have other choice to go elsewhere in my area...

Thank you for your Kind & Professional Service! Xo< /text>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) I gave a star only to be able to leave my comment, this place is terrible take my puppy on Saturday Sep 30. 2017 for cutting and washing and when I went to pick it up before I knew it the guy told me that he had cut his hair from his face but that he had given him a few hairs in one eye and that was why I was going to see him a little Irritated, I looked at him and actually looked a little strange, my little dog kept touching and rubbing his little eye with his paw. On Sunday my puppy woke up worse, with his eye glued on and he did not stop scratching his eye, he scared me, because he was suffering a lot. Today lines I took him to the vet and they had to do eye wash, because he had an infection and too much hair stuck in his eye, they put him injected antibiotic, they sent me antibiotic in pills and drops, the doctor had to shave all his eye to be able to clean and disinfect the area well. Besides that it was an unexpected expense what hurts me the most is that my puppy has had to go through this, thank God he is going to be cured, but needless to say, I will never take him there again for his lack of experience due to his negligence and for fool! It's that simple!

(Original)
Di una estrella unicamente para poder dejar mi comentario , este lugar es terrible lleve a mi perrito el sabado 30 de sep. de 2017 para corte y lavado y cuando fui a recogerlo antes de que me diera cuenta el tipo me dijo que le habia cortado el pelo de la cara pero que le habia entreado unos pelitos en un ojo y que por eso lo iba a ver un poco irritado, lo vhequie y efectivamente lo mire un poco extrano mi perrito no dejaba de tocarse y frotarse su ojito con su patita. El dia domingo mi perrito amanecio peor, con su ojo pegado y no dejaba de rascarse su ojito me asuste , porque estaba sufriendo mucho. Hoy lines lo lleve a la veterinaria y le tuvieron que hacer lavado de ojo, porque tenia infectado y demasiado pelo metido en su ojo, le pusieron antibiotico inyectado, me mandaron antibiotico en pastilla y gotas, el doctor tuvo que rasurarle todo su ojito para poder limpiar y desinfectar bien el area. Aparte que fue un gasto inesperado lo que mas me duele es que mi perrito haya tenido que pasar por esto, gracias a Dios se va a curar, pero esta demas decir que jamas volvere a llevarlo ahi por su falta de experiencia por su negligencia y por imbecil! Asi de simple!< /review>

Don't even think of installing solar panels until you have talked to Eric at PacSolar. From the beginning he was clear, informative and accurate. He gave me a price over a year prior to our remodel and ended up doing the job for less. He answers the phone, comes out and deals with you directly and gets on the roof with his excellent crew. He also handles all the paperwork and liaison with PG&E and the permits. If I could put more than five stars I would

<text>We just got solar installed by Pac Solar and it was a very smooth and easy process from start to finish. Eric is meticulous in his attention to detail and was able to educate us on all of our options and design the most logical system for our needs. After our first meeting he provided a proposal about one week later and when I researched the panels and inverters that he uses I learned that they are the best ones available on the market which was good to see. He isn't trying to save $ by using cheap materials. Pac Solar is a local San Rafael owned and operated company that stands behind their work - it is comforting to know that if anything ever does go wrong with our system, Eric will be notified via email from the monitoring system, and he will be there to fix it. We are thrilled to have joined the clean energy revolution, and our system will have paid for itself within 5 years.</text>< Pictures>

We were really very pleased at the service and professionalism of this company, particularly with the owner Eric Miller who was involved from start to finish.  We did a lot of prior research, had multiple bids, but his was the most comprehensive, easy to understand, using the best, up to date products and very competitive.  The work was done on time, with a great team who were easy and pleasant to work with; they also installed a fast charger for my new electric car, and even spot repaired our roof in preparation for the installation!  Once completed, the follow-up was great, including setting us up with PG&E, and getting us up and running with the software to monitor our solar panels output.  I would highly recommend this local company, and highly recommend getting solar!<//text>

<text>Pac Solar has been awesome.  Why?

* The Right Price.  I talked to and got bids from several other companies, and Pac Solar made a ton of financial sense.  We ended up buying a small system with microprocessors.  We've been saving money from Day 1 and will have it paid off long before I would have thought likely for us.

* Easy.  I worked with Eric throughout, and everything has been super smooth: meetings where I could ask all the questions I wanted on days and at hours that worked for me, scheduling of work and follow-up, and county and power company paperwork.  The installation was super quick, and I can track the power hour by hour online by computer or phone.

* Professional.  Everything has been done in a professional, thorough way.  I always felt that Eric was working hard, not as a hustle, but to make solar possible and to have us feel like we were getting a good system that we also understood.  At the end we got a complete binder of paperwork and an offer of a follow-up meeting down the line to evaluate how the system has been running and how to interpret savings.

We've wanted to get solar for a long time, and it's been fantastic having the process end up being so great.  It's also been a plus to support a local company.<//text>< gmap_id>

We are so pleased with PAC Solar and our new solar installation. Less than two weeks from first visit to panels up, and we are now OFF THE GRID. I was pleasantly surprised to find it quite affordable and all of the 30% rebate comes to us, not a third party. We looked into several companies and this was not only the best deal, but the most professional, with great attention to detail and to our needs. Everything was clearly explained, no misinformation or attempts to oversell, and no badmouthing the competition. I could not believe how quickly the job was finished, and how painless the process was. Eric really knows his stuff. He continues to follow up weeks after the install, making sure PG&E gets us converted to net metering, that our monitoring system is working and more. He did all of the paperwork for that as well as the install. At the end we got a complete binder of everything we did and may need to know for the future, including a packet for any new future homeowner. Pac Solar really covers all the bases. I am very impressed with this company and excited to have done this. I wanted to post a fun video of the install (so quick and painless) but cant figure out how to do it.</Review>

<text>When we decided to finally get solar panels for our house I contacted several different agencies, dreading the search knowing how fast the industry is moving and possibility of disreputable companies.  I settled on three bids, two larger businesses that advertise in the paper and Pac Solar, a company local to my area.  Whereas the larger companies did everything by phone based on a satellite photo of my house, Eric Miller, President of Pac Solar, came over personally to my house, inspected my roof and walked around the site.  He reviewed my electric bill and helped me decide on the proper number of panels and the type of inverter. He showed us the special devices to protect the roof with the installation. He reviewed details of the tax rebate.  Whereas the other companies demanded the panels to be tilted on metal frameworks: Eric understood my concern for aesthetics to place them flat on my roof and designed the system to still generate the appropriate power.
He took care of all the things I never thought about:
permits, coordination of inspections and utility interconnection documents.
His charge was the average of the three bids.
At my convenience, the work was started within a couple of weeks of signing documents and it took less than two days to install. The work was quick, professional and tidy.
After installation and we were on the grid, Eric came by and spent over an hour to explain everything about the system.
I would highly recommend Pac Solar< /text>< Response>

Eric was great! He is local family owned.  He explained all the information  and made it clear. Solar was the way to go with the 30% rebate from the government and the product paying for its self in 5 years. It's an awesome investment! We now get 100% energy from the sun. And we have a pool and hot tub !
These guys are honest and trustworthy.  Please call them first! We are very happy!<//Text>

I had three separate solar companies assess my electrical needs and propose solar arrays for my house, with associated cost estimates.  Pac Solar (Eric Miller) provided the most thorough analysis, and easily the best overall proposal.  Installation was completed in less than a day, and the electric meter was running backwards by the same afternoon.  Pac Solar took care of all permitting and dealings with PG&E, including changing the rate structure under which my solar array operates to maximize my financial savings.  Eric even showed me how to fill in the appropriate tax forms so that I'll get my federal tax credit next year.  An excellent experience throughout.  Highly recommended.< /Text>

Pac solar were  very professional in the way they evaluated the options, planned the system, installed it and the way they completed  the various regulatory and permit requirements. Everything was done on time and on budget.

The process is overseen by Eric  Miller who owns the company and I felt all along that I was in very good hands.

I recommend Pac Solar 100%.

< Review>
Eric Miller and his team at Pac Solar were terrific. Professional, knowledgable and efficient with your time. This is the second house that we have installed solar on, so we are familiar with the jargon and how it all works with PG&E. Eric was a problem solver in the design phase, coming up with a unique design that we really liked. We did TONS of research, from local companies to the big players. We read all kinds of reviews and the fine print on the warranties. Look before you leap; there are some terrible warranty terms hidden out there by the big players buying cheaply made panels of unknown long-term durability. Eric was totally up front, his pricing was quite competitive and there was no sales pressure. He was a total professional in dealing with some difficult delays due to other contractors. We have no hesitation in recommending Pac Solar. Simply terrific. We all want good local businesses to do well, this one is terrific.<//Review>

We couldn't be more pleased with our solar installation! Eric made the entire process easy, efficient, and stress-free. After meeting with and getting bids from a couple of the nationally franchised companies, we were very happy to discover this local gem. Eric cut through the rhetoric and gave us the clear cut information we needed. Unlike the other companies, he didn't try to sell us more than what we actually needed. The panels and inverters he uses are the best you can get. (Made in USA, of course.) He even offers a low interest financing option. One thing that most impressed us is that he insisted on coordinating with our roofer to install the panel supports before the new roof shingles were installed, thus eliminating the need to penetrate a brand new roof. The other companies made no such suggestion or offer. Everything went like clockwork without a hitch. The entire process was very quick, well-organized, and unobtrusive. Eric always picked up his phone whenever we called, as well as answering emails immediately. We wholeheartedly recommend this company!<//review>

If you are looking for an honest, professional solar company to install your solar panels, Pac Solar is the company to call. Eric Miller is the owner. He is very knowledgeable and trustworthy. He knows about all the different types of solar panels and inverters on the market and will explain the differences, pros and cons. He will also attend all inspections, climb on your roof to inspect the condition of your roof and photograph before/after pictures so you can see where the panels will be placed. He also provides you with information necessary to receive your state tax credit which I appreciated it.

I contacted 5 different solar companies before choosing Pac Solar. I compared prices, panel types, solar output expectations, customer service and the capacity to complete my installation within a reasonable amount of time and Pac Solar came up on top. I was pleased start to finish and highly recommend this company. Call Eric if you are looking for a local company to add solar to your home.</Text>

Aside from being a locally based company, we were extremely impressed by Eric Miller, President of Pac Solar. He, as promised, took full control over the project from A to Z. It couldn't have been easier for us. Eric visited us at home a number of times during the survey and design development process. He secured all the permits, oversaw installation of the system (he has a great installation crew), worked with PG&E and the building inspectors, and lastly he gave us a binder with all of the relevant project documents. He also hooked us up with My Enlighten so that we can monitor or system activities.
Eric was open, honest, well organized and timely. He is a true knowledgeable professional. Our solar system looks and works great.
We would highly recommend Eric and Pac Solar to anyone interested in a solar system for their home.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>We were very pleased with the way Pac Solar handled our project from the first meeting. Everything was very smooth and coordinated between the roofing project and the solar project. Eric was very straightforward, honest and open on what we could expect, and we anticipate his estimates will be on track at the end of the year.  He also committed to returning at the end of year one, to evaluate his assumptions and mentioned he's been very close on every assessment he's done with other projects.  I'm certain this will be our situation, as well.  I would highly recommend Pac Solar and Eric!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80859a3d6804659b:0xcd7383482dc1dcdb<//gmapID></record>

<review>I could not be happier with my solar installation done by Pac Solar. It was about as easy as it could be. Eric took care of everything; from planning, permits, installation and lots of explanations. Eric was very good about answering my questions and making sure I understood how net credits worked. The final packet I got was very detailed and will be nice to have. Micro inverters are definitely the way to go with color now days and that's what Pac Solar uses. The system is very in-obtrusive in the appearance of my house which is both good and bad. I want people to ask so I can tell them about Eric at Pac Solar.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

After doing some research and talking to neighbors with solar systems I had several bids for the job of adding solar to my  house. Eric Miller with Pac Solar provided me with an excellent design and a complete proposal. Everything was done on time and exactly as called for in the proposal. The crew did the installation in less then a day, and I was up and running. I am very happy with the quality of the system and the quality of the work.< /review>

He knows his stuff, and delivers what he says he will do.  Our house system was fairly small, and some solar companies would not consider installing a system for us, because it wouldn't be a big (profitable) enough job for them.  Eric was absolutely willing to install it for us, at least in part, because he believes in what he is doing--that solar is the right thing to do for the planet.  The team who installed the system were friendly and efficient.  I also consulted Eric about the non-profit organization I work for.  Though we didn't pursue solar for very technical electric company reasons (nothing to do with Pac Solar), he gave me the info I needed to make an informed decision.  No sales pressure, just facts and options.  Would definitely recommend them to anyone considering solar.</review><user_name>Sam Yates</user_name><pics>None< /pics></record>

Eric (the owner and founder) and his company, Pac Solar, are awesome!  He and his staff are extremely professional, courteous, and deliver on everything they promise in a timely fashion.  Further, Eric himself, is extremely knowledgeable, provides excellent advice and customer service, and is overall, a stand-up guy.  And, their pricing is quite competitive and, therefore, quite fair.  It was a no-brainer to give Eric and his company a 5-star rating!  These folks are HIGHLY recommended!</review>

Pac Solar did a phenomenal job with our home solar installation.  My family and I have been interested in having solar installed for a while. After a few quotes and terrible pushy sales calls  we put the project and idea of solar on hold.  We then received a recommendation to try Eric Miller at Pac Solar.   Eric was extremely easy to work with; thorough and knowledgable.  The first visit he was on the roof in a jiffy getting his measurements and had a quote a few days later.  Eric explained every detail to us in a way that was informative and educational rather than pushy.  Evident Eric takes great pride in his company, the work that he does, and stands by his products.  Eric was direct; answered all of our questions and concerns.  Once we decided to hire Pac Solar the process was just as seamless.  This was the quickest and most efficient work we have ever had done to our home. After starting the project it took a total of two days with little disruption to our household routine. His crew was polite and competent.  We are thrilled with the way our solar looks and performs.  I highly recommend Eric and his team at Pac Solar.</review>

Once we decided it was time to get solar, my husband and I interviewed four companies.  The decision for us to go with Eric and Pac Solar was easy.  Eric was so super detailed and professional.  We have a newer flat roof in some areas.  Some companies wanted to puncture that roof to install the solar.  Eric knew all about our roof and came up with a commercial ballast system for the solar that would not hurt the integrity of the roof.  He also provided us with diagrams and technical information showing the layout and design of the system.

The installation was flawless.  Eric and his staff came on time.  They were professional, friendly and neat and clean.  We are thrilled with our new system!!</text>

I recently had Pac Solar install a solar system on my house in Mill Valley.  I was so impressed with the attention to detail, the guidance that Eric Miller gave me, the honest approach, and finally the exceptional installation.  My home was completely ready in 1 day and you could not even know anything was different.  Clean, friendly, and professional to the nth degree.
I highly recommend Pac Solar for your solar needs.< /Review>

<Review>It was a pleasure to work with Eric Miller, the owner of Pac Solar.   He was on time for all our  appointments, diligent about periodically following up after I put the project on hold for over 3 months, very organized and detail oriented.   He explained all the details of going solar in plain English so that a non-technical person could understand.   I inquired about obtaining an electric car and other home improvements that would increase our electrical usage, but he did not take the opportunity to try and sell us more panels than needed for our current electricity usage.  He explained how it made more sense to size the system for our current usage and only add panels when we knew for certain that we would be increasing the usage.   Eric was on site to supervise all roof penetrations.   He also took care of all the PG&E paperwork and provided me with a booklet afterwards that is well organized and explains every aspect of the system, including how to apply for the tax credit.   It’s very refreshing to work with someone like Eric who is completely on top of his game.   Highly recommended.< /Review>< pics>

<Text>I knew that redoing my roof was a perfect time to think about going solar and I started looking at different local solar companies at the same time I was finalizing my roof project.
None of solar companies I short listed were bad (I got 3 quotes) and their quotes and options seemed comparable at first. After talking to Eric, I knew that I would be in good hands and I'm really happy of my decision to pick Pac Solar for our project. Eric really went above and beyond in educating me about solar and customized the solar project to my family needs and to our environment (our type of house, the shade from the trees, etc.). He was always available to answer our questions, worked well with the roofing company, helped us get the project financed, explained all the steps, took care of all the paperwork (PGE, county) and the installation was a breeze. No surprise or stress for this project.
I will definitely recommend Eric and Pac Solar to my friends and neighbors.<//Text>< rate>

I had long wanted to get a solar power system installed for our house in Marin County, but never got around to doing the research.
When I finally started looking in January of 2015 my wife and I had moved to London, so all of the initial communication had to be done via phone and e-mail which quickly centered our research around local suppliers. Eric and Pac Solar was extremely flexible and provided very compressive quotes and ‘hand held’ us throughout the initial scoping and the overall process (including dealing with my own desire to know all the technical details ;-)). Once we signed the agreement it was less than 2 weeks before our ~7kW system was installed and up and running. Zero concerns, zero issues and 100% satisfaction – all done without my wife and I having to travel back to California! We didn’t even meet Eric until after the installation was complete and the system was functional! Eric and Pac Solar provided an exceptional level of trust and professionalism throughout the project and pricing and service is not only competitive but also exceptional. We have been operational for 4+ weeks and I love the system and our ability to monitor it remotely.<//Review>

<review>Thumbs up for Pac Solar! I had 20 panels installed and the whole process was seamless and professional. Eric, the owner, is very hands on and knowledgeable, not only about the solar installation but also about all the PD&E requirements. We interviewed with 2 other solar companies before choosing Pac Solar and I highly recommend them.< /review>< pics>

After two other bids, we chose PAC Solar because Eric's assessment was professional, no sales hype, top notch materials and it was the best price. Eric handled all of the permits with the county and the paper work with PG&E -- seamlessly. Eric's explanations were clear and concise -- he was highly professional -- we got exactly what we agreed to. Thanks!</text>

I cannot say enough good things about my experience with Eric Miller and his company Pac Solar. From our first meeting and throughout the installation process, Eric and his team made the experience painless. Their work is impeccable and Eric's follow up and follow through is unparalleled. Not to mention that the cost of the system was the best I found after interviewing 4 different companies.The entire installation was done in my absence as I was travelling to the east coast for 2 weeks. Eric made the changes and paperwork with PG&E simple and easy and I could not be happier with my system. I would highly recommend that anyone interested in converting to solar energy use Pac Solar Corporation.< /Text>

I recommend Eric and Pac Solar without reservation.< /Text>< pics>

So glad we went with PAC Solar!  The whole installation process went very quickly and smoothly.  Eric was very responsive to all our questions and explained things in language we could understand.  He is passionate about doing a good job and his motivation is obviously about much more than just making a living. We looked at other companies, and none were going to promise the high quality components or the personal attention and care that we received from Pac Solar.  The price was also significantly lower than the estimate we got from a national company.  Go local!  Go Pac Solar!<//review>

Upon our decision to purchase solar, Eric at Pac Solar promptly answered my questions, ( which I continued to ask through out) with patient, clear communication and essential information.  He met us with a no-hype, "techno-savy" proposal that gave us confidence and trust that the products he was installing were superior, and the workmanship would be top notch.  As permits and inspections were navigated the installation was efficient, the work crisp and excellent quality.  We are very pleased with both the system and Pac Solar.  Thanks Eric and Sara!< /text>

I had Pac Solar install solar on my house.  These guys are super professional and a pleasure to do business with.  Plus, they were much more reasonable than one of those "big box" solar companies.  You will be pleased if you work this company.</review>

<rating>5< /rating><text>I'm an engineer by training (so pretty analytical) as well as very particular aesthetically when it comes to contractors. Frankly I drive most of them crazy doing spreadsheet analyses and overseeing the details. Eric Miller/Pac Solar exceeded my expectations. I pulled 5 solar contractors from the California government site based on those who've done the largest number of installations in Marin, requested bids, and analyzed each based on upfront cost and projected annual energy production/cost offset. Pac Solar was one of the most cost effective. But what really sold me on Pac Solar was Eric's thoroughness and professionalism. He showed up when he said he would, was the most thorough of any of the firms, and paid the most attention to the details. He even had his first child during the proposal process, and hardly skipped a beat! Many proposals may look the similar on paper, but I'm confident Eric delivered an exceptional customer experience you simply won't get from other contractors.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I shopped around for solar for awhile and did my due diligence. Most of the folks I talked to tried to upsell me, but Eric at Pac Solar was a straight shooter. He has been in the industry a long time and runs his own business now so that he can focus on providing excellent value and customer service. He was incredibly responsive, scheduling meetings within the next day or two. Within two weeks of signing the paperwork I had everything installed. He took care of the inspection with the city. I spent less than 60 minutes of my time with the entire process. I can't recommend a better value and service.</Text>

We were on a VERY tight timeline due to getting a new roof installed.  We got several quotes quickly but Eric was BY FAR the most professional, organized, and thorough with getting us a quick quote.  Honestly, just have him give you a quote and you will see the major difference between Pac Solar and other companies.  It was a no brainer to hire him and he delivered above and beyond with seeing the entire project through from start to finish.  Even now we had a question for him relating to some documents and he answered his phone immediately and gave us the information we needed.  Our panels are working perfectly and we are 100% confident that we will have no issues in the future.  However knowing that we are working with Pac Solar ensures us that even if we did have an issue we would have it handled professionally and without hesitation by Eric and his team.<//review>

As with other reviewers, I have nothing but good things to say about this company. I now have 16 of Eric's panels happily collecting rays on the SE side of my roof. Prior to meeting Eric, who was referred by a very old (and demanding) friend, I interviewed three other companies, all of whom hustled me on the phone, or online. The firms were all represented by agents who must have failed as aluminum siding or used car sellers.  Mr. Miller is the exact opposite. He's smart, prepared, friendly and, unfailingly, he has done everything he promised to do, accurately, professionally and on the dot of the expected time.<//Text>

<response>None<//response><review>Prior to meeting with Eric from Pac Solar, I had a consultation with another solar company.  Those folks took nearly four weeks to get back to me with a bid, which came in quite high.  They also stated that I would need certain items (driving up the cost) to make a solar system work, which I ended up not needing at all.  When Eric from Pac Solar came out, it was evident to me that he was extremely knowledgeable and experienced.  He got back to me within a few days with a very detailed, professionally presented bid.  I was surprised by how much much lower Pac Solar’s bid was than the bid I had previously received despite the fact that Pac Solar’s bid was 10 times more professional and clearly more thoughtfully researched and assembled.  Eric took the time to ensure I got the system I needed without adding unnecessary costs.  During the project, Eric and his crew were extremely professional and diligent.  The system went up quickly, and Eric took the time to explain what was being done throughout the process and why.  He is very cognizant about the aesthetics of the systems he builds, understanding that this is sitting on or around a person’s home.  I have not had an electric bill now since summer of 2014.  I couldn’t be more thrilled, and HIGHLY recommend Pac Solar!<//review>< gmap_id>

I worked with Eric around New Year's to start designing a solar array for home in Petaluma.  There were no south-facing portions of the roof for my installation but thanks to Eric's careful planning and measurements, he designed an east-west configuration that is subtle in appearance and offsets my net power usage for my home.  Eric coordinated with a local roofer to ensure that the new roof and solar dovetailed nicely and they did.  Once the rain let up my system and new roof were installed in less than a week.  Eric followed up with details of how the system worked and how to understand the new power bills and what to expect.  I now log on daily to check my power generation and smile as I know the system will pay for itself in a few years and I've dramatically reduced my environmental footprint.

I'd gladly work with Pac Solar again and have no reservations to recommend the company.< /review>

<Review>We assembled a list of possible solar installers after conducting extensive research among our friends who had installed solar and perusing multiple online resources. We interviewed 6-7 major solar installation companies and quickly narrowed the field to Eric Miller who immediately stood out as more professional and experienced than all of the other installers. He provided solid information upfront as to the condition of our roof and a list of roofers and demonstrated an ease with working with our the Ross permitting process. He never promised more than he delivered. In fact, we trusted him so much that we agreed to allow him to install our 15 panels while we were away on vacation. Up return, Eric helped us quickly problem-solve one small hiccup and sat down with us to show us an app that allows us to track our solar system's performance. To summarize, we are very happy!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

This is my first review on Google+, but I am thrilled to promote Pac Solar. Most of my sentiments are reflected by other reviewers, but here are some of the highlights.

1) Eric Miller - Eric takes tremendous pride in his business. He is honest, extremely knowledgeable, responsive and accommodating, and he earned my confidence off the bat. I am a physician and my clinical schedule was at times inflexible - Eric bent over backwards to keep things on schedule.

2) Competitive rates - Solar installation was a significant expenditure for me, and I did my homework, thoroughly reviewing multiple companies and obtaining several estimates. The proposal offered by Pac Solar was constructed to meet (and not exceed) my needs, and was extremely fair and reasonable.

3) Timeliness - Eric let me know the proposed timeline for the job, and his company delivered with every aspect of the process without a glitch.

4) User friendliness -- Pac Solar made the whole thing painless. They handled all of the nitty gritty details, worked with PG&E and the city, and ultimately used DocuSign when necessary to obtain my signature. They essentially handed the whole thing to me on a platter. It really could not have gone any smoother or been any easier.

5) Customer service -- I compared Pac Solar with some of the "big box" installers, and ultimately it was the human factor that won me over. Working with a single person to discuss sales, installation and troubleshooting for me is far superior to needing to contact multiple different departments within the same company. I'm one month in, and everything is working out perfectly. However, should I encounter any issues down the road, I am confident that I'll be in good hands with Pac Solar.<//review>

<text>Professional and fully informed on all aspects of designing and installing a PV system.  Technical, legal, permits, planning, install and start-up were all handled by Eric and his team. Local support with well made components give confidence for a system that will work for many years. Other quotes received did not give the technical backup and design information, so I knew there was no guesswork with PacSolar.  I delayed my install as I needed to get a new roof on first, but Eric picked up our earlier discussions and put together a revised competitive package.  Short weather delay was the only problem but work was re-scheduled without issues.<//text>< Rate>

<review>I’d been considering going solar for a while, and finally decided to take the plunge.  I looked at both leasing and buying.  The leasing company wanted me to sign a contract before they’d even give me any real sort of quote.  Eric of Pac Solar was the exact opposite of the leasing deal – helpful, informative, professional and personable.  He answered all the questions I had plus some I hadn’t thought of.  He gave me a turnkey solution and then worked with me through the challenges I faced in getting the financing and with my problematic Eichler roof .  He was patient, flexible, prompt and helpful – even coming out on a Sunday morning to explain things when my wife was present.
I can’t speak highly enough of Eric and the service Pac Solar provides.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Just got my first full-month utility bill since getting a fantastic solar array installed on my roof!   Electric bill was $6.10 (connection fee only) !   Down from $112.70 the previous full month!!  So fun watching the meter run backwards. Now we have to work to prevent P G and E from increasing grid connection fees and jeopardizing net metering.  In the future I'll be getting $$$ back from Marin Clean Energy (MCE- our local Community Choice program), as I'll be producing more electrons than I use !  Plus...powering my future electric car! Thanks to Eric Miller and Pac Solar Corporation for getting my 24 panels and inverters installed and approved in less than 3 days!   Change is a comin' !<//text>

<review>We had a great experience using Pac Solar for our system.
Price was 4% cheaper than the other bid we seriously considered.
Their proposal was professional and complete and used conservative projections to show payback. Other bids exaggerated factors such as likely increase in PG&E rates.
There were a few issues we had technical questions about, and Eric was able to answer them at any level of depth we wanted.
Eric was responsive (even on weekends), showed up on time, and the crew finished the job ahead of schedule.
This is a small local company with only a few crews that have been with the firm for many years and have the install process down pat. No worry about new, poorly trained installers messing up your roof, as with some of the large, rapidly growing companies.<//review><Rate>5</Rate>< Pictures>

<text>We were curious about adding solar power to our house but not very knowledgeable about it.  We purchased a home in Mill Valley and were interested in solar for green energy, the possibility of owning an electric car, tax benefits, and decreasing dependence on oil and coal.  Pac Solar was the first company we contacted.  Eric, Pac Solar's owner, was knowledgeable about design, tax benefits, owning, leasing, and car charging.  We usually shop around but we decided to commit to installing solar power and work with Pac Solar.  We have no regrets.  Some highlights about working with pac solar:
-It's a bay area (marin) business and Eric has been quick to respond to the few questions we've had.  They install all over the SF bay area.
-Eric provided excellent guidance on every detail of our solar system to folks like us who were curious but had no details about solar power.
-We've seldom worked with contractors like Pac Solar who maintain enthusiasm during sales, installation, and after working with them.
-The employees  who worked with him on the installation were knowledgeable, cautious, and professional.
-Pac Solar was willing to coordinate work with other contractors.
Pac Solar is highly recommended!< /text>< Resp>

<rate>5<//rate><text>When you buy into solar energy, you pick a point in time, preferably while rebates exist. Right now, at 30% federal tax credit (which big solar companies TAKE to reduce their costs, not yours),  the cost of solar finally got down to a relative sweet spot finally. Yes, the technology will change for the better, same with cars. You just have to pick the best time for "you" to buy.  With any solar installation, there are up-front costs. But PAC works on providing you with the payback in years for the saved energy at current PGE costs. PGE always inflates their energy pricing (2 - 3%/year), so it often is "less than what's calculated", if you generalize and project a 5.5 to 5.8 year payback at a static energy cost.

Installation is explained well in terms of where conduits will be run for maximum appeal and shortest run where DC voltage loss is lowest. Eric explains why or why not you would benefit from a string inverter vs. a set of micro-inverters, and makes good sense, after analyzing shading areas, obstructions and trees or neighbor's long chimney shadow in winter at 4 PM that may reduce overall output. All these items add-up. The other solar companies don't go up on your roof with you and "look around" for such things that could reduce your photon count to the projected installation area.

Overall, the purchase and installation process was well done, well engineered, and a full and complete disclosure of the entire process and how it was designed, installed, warrantied for parts/labor, and configured for grid tie in, PGE rate schedules, city permitting and sign off, was all presented in a neatly organized binder for reference and any possible future warranty or post-installation service.< /text>< Pics>

Don't waste time with joker solar salesman in their company logo golf shirts. Pacsolar is the first and last stop.  Eric seamlessly guides every step of the solar process.  He is responsive and professional in every way.  MOST Importantly, if you need a new roof, Eric coordinates with the roofer to integrate the panel standoffs into the roof, thereby preserving all warrantees. It would be idiotic to do it any other way, and this should be the first question you ask any solar con tractor.  Save your time and sanity.  Call Pacsolar.</review>

When investigating roof-top solar energy companies, you will find Pac Solar has perfected the essential requirements for such a significant investment in, what is for most of us, a challenging technology to fully understand.  To begin, we dealt with Eric Miller, founder and hands-on job foreman, not a sales person.  He explained every detail not only of the cost-benefits of residential solar systems but also the technology behind the panels, AC/DC inverters and how the power grid works.  Next, Eric thoroughly explained the price, schedule, and mechanics of the installation and then handled the acquisition of all permits and PG&E approvals.  The installation itself was impressive due to our extremely steep-slanted roof.  Not only was this accomplished on time, but also Eric’s insistence on his workers using ropes and harnesses for safety reflects well on his company values.  Finally, we are delighted that our electricity bill fell below zero in the first full month of operation, that we are contributing to the growing adoption of renewable energy, and that Pac Solar, and we, have chosen to exclusively use solar panels manufactured in the U.S.<//text>< pictures>

If words like kilowatts, inverters, and conduit do not fall trippingly off your tongue, you need someone to explain how solar works, how the costs and savings stack up, and how the system can connect to your home's existing electrical system.  Eric Miller is the guy who can explain this to you (more than once if necessary).  Unlike our first bid, Eric got up on the roof and measured exactly how the panels would fit in between our roof vents, and he produced a drawing of the layout.  He also looked at our electrical panel, and immediately knew we needed a subpanel (more space) for the connection.  That turned out to be a simple item, but one the other vendor's salesperson could not fathom.

Installation was very professional.  The guys on the roof used a ladder support to protect my rain gutters where the ladder rested.  They took great care to measure the joist locations, so the support feet would be in the exact right location.   It is unnerving to hear anyone drilling holes in your roof, but the triple rain protection they install is a belt-and-suspenders approach.  The guy installing the subpanel was similarly careful, and he did a beautiful job routing the conduit that leads to the roof.

Eric makes a very important final visit to teach you how to monitor your system's electricity production, which is available realtime.  He even gives you a draft tax form to claim your tax credit!

I really don't think anyone will beat the service and knowledge of Pac Solar.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.< /review>

After much research, we went with PacSolar and we strongly recommend PacSolar for a solar power solution.

Sifting through solar energy providers and system options can be a daunting process. Eric Miller from PacSolar cut through the confusing issues, including a detailed evaluation of our historical PG&E usage and billing, and he worked with us to design and install a cost efficient solar power system for our large home.

From our first phone conversation, to the final sign off on the system allowing us to connect to PG&E, Eric provided outstanding follow-up and clarity regarding our contract, installation process and schedules. Before any contracts were signed, Eric personally met with us at our home to discuss and evaluate our system design and he was on the job site at the beginning of each day during the installation process.

We are very satisfied with the professionalism of the PacSolar team. Everyone we dealt with representing PacSolar was on-time, prepared and above all, competent.

If you choose to “go solar” please check in with Eric before making your final decision on a provider.< /text>

<Time>1486779684585<//Time><rating>5< /rating><Review>We just went online with our solar PV system from Pac Solar and could not be more pleased! The owner, Eric Miller, is extremely professional, truthful and clearly understands and explains the details of going solar. I am an energy efficiency engineer and knowledgeable about PV. We obtained proposals from three vendors. While the other proposals were mostly marketing pieces that proposed systems significantly larger than we needed, the PacSolar system was thoughtfully sized according to our anticipated electricity usage. The proposal outlined the installation and operational details, including the estimated production and rate options. His price was competitive and he uses top of the line components, including panels with micro inverters (no large inverter hanging on the outside of the house!). Eric coordinated installation of the panels with our reroof, so no new penetrations were needed. Installation of the panels was seamless and they even installed our electric vehicle charger at no extra cost. Eric took care of all the PG&E paperwork promptly and we received our Permission to Operate a week after the installation was complete. If you are considering solar, PacSolar is the way to go!</Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

We were very happy with the job Eric did from the front-end all the way to post-installation.  He was very diligent following-up early on and letting us know of key deadlines for the changing rate schedules prior to us even making our decision.  In the Sales process we were able to ask frank questions around the products he reps and the others in the market and get fairly objective responses with obvious biases expected.  His sales approach was non-pushy, non-salesy, but was there every time you needed something answered.  We felt like we were buying "him" vs. just some big company's products, as some of the others in the market made us feel like.  He also was flexible about where we could place the panels and worked up separate quotes accordingly, which some other bidders didn't feel was required of them.

Our installation process was scheduled well ahead of the latest possible date, which allowed us to get up and running quick and in line ahead any imminent PGE changes that were announced. The job was transparent and there were no obvious mistakes or issues and communication was excellent, including pictures from the roof that we couldn't get ourselves without hassle.

Post-installation Eric walked us through the mobile app and the electrical box connections and advised on various operational dynamics that leads us up to our first 'true-up' with PGE next summer.  Our first couple of months have operated seamlessly and we have not paid a dime to PGE, which we will continue to monitor into the shorter, colder winter days.  That will be the final unknown aspect of this whole exercise, which is to see how the system design/size plays out relative to Eric's guidance and estimates.  However, we decided to place our bets on his experience and judgment and are quite optimistic we'll be fine.

Eric's a very good person and professional businessman without all the unnecessary attitude you sometimes get. I would definitely recommend him to others looking for a partner in this non-trivial decision for your home.<//text>

< review>
The selection of a Solar company that I could trust with the design, installation, and maintenance of a Solar Electric Photovoltaic System has been a roller coaster ride. I first started looking around for some quotes in the summer of 2015. I had many sales’ visits and site inspections from different companies, during which I gather data and research the true cost of Solar. What struck me is that every salesman I talked to had an elaborate ROI calculation that seemed dubious (at best) and were putting a lot of pressure to sign contracts during the first visit. Also some companies preferred string inverters while others praised micro-inverters. While I much preferred micro-inverters, the prices quoted were ridiculously high. So I decided to put the project on hold.

Until one day I read a post about a neighbor recommending Pac Solar and decided to give Eric Miller a call. It was not long after our first call that Eric came for a site inspection and we talked at length about component brands, system size, warranties, etc. Having an EE background, it was refreshing to talk to someone who could actually answer my questions! Eric came back a few days later with a proposal backed with a comprehensive document explaining the choice of components, the process of  permitting and installation, warranty, prices, and timeline laid out in a totally transparent way.

Before signing off, I decided to do my due diligence and talked to a friend working in the energy industry (also an electrical engineer). He confirm the choice of micro-inverters and panels as the best in the industry today, a claim backed by an internal review his company did to evaluate performance and efficiency of components over time. So I decided to go for it.

I was extremely pleased by the service, the workmanship, and the attention to details throughout the design, installation, and review process. Eric has always been very responsive in returning calls and and got the job done according to schedule.

The best part of it is that my system will pay itself off in 5 years! How is that? Because the system was properly sized to my electricity needs. If you only compare the price per Watt, you might be thinking “yea this is more expensive per Watt than company X or Y”. But this is the wrong way to look at it. Keep in mind that an oversized Solar PV System using a string inverter will be much more expensive out the door and will take 2-3 times longer to pay off benefitting only the Solar vendor. What you need to be looking for is the total price of the system and how long it will take to pay it off (everything else being equal).</review>

Their prices seemed reasonable, for a dispensary.<//text>

<Review>I bought a $55 1/8 that is advertised as Denver cookies on Sunday from this place. You can’t smell the flower at this place. It’s dimly lit inside of this store. The flower tender tells me she likes it. I buy it. As soon as I crack it I know I’ve been fleeced. I called to see if there’s anything they could do because I wouldn’t buy this stuff in 2001 let as long as 2021. It’s dark green flower that smells like dirt. Does absolutely nothing for you. This place tells me to reach out to claybourne, that there’s nothing green solutions could do for me. Doesn’t care about repeat business. I wouldn’t give this flower away. Imagine buying a pack of cigarettes and it’s actually a much cheaper brand. Or a bottle of expensive vodka that is actually well water.<//Review><rate>1</rate><Gmap_id>0x809ad0eba04f1935:0x2a61255c0acfd28< /Gmap_id><name>Nick Thomas< /name>< pics>

I Love this spot, it quickly became my favorite midtown dispensary with an old school style and modern selection. Great staff, educated bud tenders, point system to keep you loyal and by god are they efficient - if there's a line, don't worry, they'll get you what you need in no time.</review>

Sammy was THE BEST😝😜. I am mainly am an Indica smoker due to my late shifts and not being able to sleep in the daytime. Nice European man Sammy with the handsome beard sticking out the mask, he got me some solid stuff. This ain’t no European Wax Center. This was a European Weed Center!!!! Best service in downtown Sac! 5 stars if I could. High up in the clouds just where I wanna be.</Review>

Been here twice now and I must say the bud tenders are very knowledgeable they are extremely helpful. They have a 15 min parking spot in front of the building that always seems to be open and the best part is if you spend 40 bucks or more you get a credit (credit dollar for dollar) and when you get up to 420 credits you get 30 bucks off your purchase. What a win 👍👍<//Review>

Small but mighty perfectly describes this dispensary! They have a great selection of flower, concentrates, and edibles, and plenty of loyal customers. Are you in midtown and too sober? They’ve got a great location right in Midtown next to lots of fun places to be and great restaurants to eat from. They have a great range of prices for all their products, and they even have a loyalty program! I am a brand ambassador for Heavy Hitters, which means I often times do demo events at Green Solutions where I bring deals and swag to the customers! Green solutions is always a good time, they may have a small building but they pack a great punch of awesome customer service, personalized recommendations, and frequent promotions bringing customers the best deals they can! Definitely worth a stop if you’re in Midtown Sac!< /Text>

Looking for something on the cheaper end. Hooked me up but only had the display left. Gave me 10% discount (big whoop) but when I weighed the flower it was a little over half a gram light.</Text>

I am a pretty harsh critic of dispensaries. I am also what I would consider a cannabis snob so I'm pretty particular about where I go and the products I consume. It seems like most of the dispensaries in Sacramento are run by the same management company. This one is unlike all the others. It is small it's friendly I love everybody that works there and the product is always top notch. Even if the selection is small the product is always very good. they also have a reward program which I seem to rack up pretty quickly but it's nice to go in and be told you have $30 reward waiting. Thanks staff, you're all top notch< /Review>

This reliable little dispensary has been one of my go to's for years. Parking is easy and it's in a nice part of town, plenty of places to walk to and check out once you're out.  They do take cash and card btw!  Friendly staff! Shout out to Becca, Justin and Alex have always been knowledgeable with the products and have helped me out considerably in the past.</Text>

People are friendly and the quality is good but really overpriced. You can find the exact same product at some of the other shops for as much as 20$ cheaper. Bought the calm canndescent for 65$. Found it at another shop for 47$. Who in there right mind would pay 70$ for an eighth. Sorry Green, just keeping it real.<//Review>

They are polite and ready to answer all questions. Compliance is important to them. I dig that. A little pricey. Bring a go bag.</text>

< review>
I did some research for a friend who has cerebral palsy and found this location to have a couple items with a higher CBD content.

Though I wasn't happy having have to register just for CBD drops, I understand the facility does not make state law. It would have been nice to have someone who knew a little and could have given me more I formation. It was like the help is high...

So if you need the highest dose of CBD for a chronic (no pun intended) illness then this is your place. 18:1 or 20:1<//review>

Your food is mediocre, and you seriously have no idea on how to run a business, a fruit street vendor does a better job then you. Your place is a joke. Oh and instead of worrying about other business you should focus on making your food better and you can also make your store look more presentable cause it looks like a run down minimart, give it a paint job at least. I hope I didn't get food poisoning from this place.< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>Do yourself a favor and drive the extra 10 minutes over the hill to Pacoima. Any restaurant there will get you way better food than this place. Plus, the owner regularly keeps his pants unzipped...is this an attempt to make women feel uncomfortable? Is he hoping that it will make one actually desire him? It’s hard to say. But what I can say, is that this place is run down and trashy and the frozen microwave food matches the decor. Puro basurero.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80c2894bf21292e7:0xf5421444cf3831c0< /Gmap_id>< user_name>

All I needed was to use that device that tells you why your check engine light is on.... but nnooooo....but  We can sell you one for $45 but because of the covid virus we can't let you use it anymore... Hhmmm,  well that's funny, all the other auto parts stores let us use it. Its getting ridiculous. What a waste of time. I picked them instead of the Autozone or someone else...ugh! HOWEVER,  I did get my "Blue Lives Matter" sticker... 👍👍<//text>

Young man, wish I could remember his name. Very helpful and professional. I had a hard time understanding the instructions on how to put on my windshield wipers and he came out and helped me. Because of that service I will always shop at O'Reilly first and reccomend O'Reilly to other drivers.< /text>

These guys are great! Went in and told them I just put a 9000 rpm roller cam in my truck and thought I smelled antifreeze, but didn't want to clog the thermostat. I told them I just need Alumaseal. They didn't try to oversell me and knew just what I was talking about. That's rare! If you have a problem these guys are definitely smart enough to figure it out and help you! Tell them the guy with the 9,000 rpm roller cam in the one ton Chevy van sent you.< /Review>

This is a very small Oreilly location.  They don't have the selection of the larger locations,  but they have the basics.  If you need any chemicals or lubricants or car care products they have them.  If you are looking for something specific you may need to go to a larger footprint location.  The same thing would hold true for parts as well.  Staff is helpful and knowledgable for any questions you may have.<//text>

<Text>My elderly mother (82 year old) recently went to this store requesting assistance for difficulties she was having with her mobile phone and wanting information about how to get it replaced via the insurance that she was paying for. NATE was unable to answer her questions and although there was no one else in the store, he was impatient and treated an elderly Asian woman in a disrespectful manner by telling her to "Get out of here", "Leave the store", and "Shoo" as if she was annoying animal. I see from the reviews here that many customers are treated well and are satisfied with the service and so it suggests that my mother was targeted for some reason based on her race, gender, age, accent or other factors. In the current sociopolitical context, this is precisely the sort of #asianhate towards immigrant seniors that many of us are worried about for our loved ones. It is deeply troubling that AT&T is eager to upcharge for all types of additional services and willing to take on customers to up their quota for business, but unable to support customers once they have our money.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1616688023549, 'text': 'Hi Jen!

<Review>I went in to upgrade my iPhone and left with not only a new phone but also a better plan that cost less. My boyfriend, who was just there to accompany me, was so impressed that he ended up upgrading his phone and plan as well as purchasing several accessories. Daniel and Chris walked us through transferring our data to our new phones and helped us re-access our apps. They made sure everything was right. Great customer service.< /Review>< rate>

Best customer service, Nate took care of everything we needed he was extremely helpful and friendly. Nice to see great customer service especially during these outrageous lockdowns. I’m glad they are still open and ready to help! Thanks Nate!<//Review>

<Text>Unable to work with an E sim due not being a corporate store. Customer rep made statements she did not have to serve me due to COVID and using the pandemic so they do not have to address an AT&T service feature was infuriating.

You have choices so understand if you take issue with ATT this locations staff might choose to not help you and site COVID as the reason why.

To their credit, they tried but were not able to resolve my ESim need. This was due to this location not being a corporate store.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1599178710187, 'text': 'Hello Keith Irby Serving our customers with the best service possible is something we strive for every day.

I was helped by Daniel and his customer service was truly above and beyond. He greeted us as soon as we walked in and took his time assisting us. We had gone in to replace my daughter's broken phone and Daniel did such an exceptional job, I ended up getting a new phone as well! I couldn't be happier with the service provided during my visit.<//text>

<text>Absolutely atrocious customer service. I have been a customer for over 5 years the bills change constantly there is no customer service support anywhere. Their plans are less than competitive... I went in today to ask what they would do to keep me as a customer... one guy couldn’t be bothered and seemed more interested txting than helping customers the other lady rolled her eyes gave me a loyalty number to call to see if they could get me a new phone because they don’t offer promotions for existing clients! Ok how about you call the number while I’m in the store to see if that’s an option?! After all that to top it off she added snarkly “guess you know what you need to do.” Yeah change carriers ASAP! Oh and not to mention they can take 7 days to unlock your phone after it’s paid off. Also I never get service anywhere! Absolutely horrendous experience... don’t waste your time just go to sprint or T-Mobile.</text>< resp>

Over the past year I have gone into this store twice and asked them to put a new screen protector on (that is covered under manufacturer warranty) and knowing they make no money off it, they are still more than willing to help.

I love this AT&T store. I won’t go anywhere else because employees at this store care about what is the best for me and my family. Also every time I go into the store; the manager Kevin goes above and beyond to make sure I am taken care of. You guys rock!< /text>

I will give it one star bc the sales rep and security guard were very kind but the manager threatened to have me removed from the store within the 1st 5 min I was there bc I said I was not going to leave until I got an answer and resolution as to why my phone could not be unlocked when I was told by customer service I had no other option but to go directly to an att store. I’ve been a loyal customer for almost 10 years but this past year has blown my mind. This store and att In general only treats you well when it involves getting your business and zero interest in customer retention. They do not own up to their mistakes.<//Review>

Top notch customer service. All the employees go above and beyond to help customers with AT&T related issues. FYI: this isn’t a Samsung or apple care store so don’t expect them to be able to fix software or hardware issues.</Text>

I was told I can immediately unlock a go phone so I could use it in another country and now I'm being told I need 6 months of service before it can be unlocked.  I wouldn't have purchased the phone if the sales person hadn't assured me that it could be immediately unlocked.  And now the manager (Joel) is non-responsive and avoiding the issue. Soooo frustrating. They just lost a potential customer unless this is resolved.  I will be tracking down a regional manager to make sure something is done. Unacceptable!<//Text>< Response>

Went in to drop off a directv box after ATT customer service told us to do so. Kevin, the manager, was neither willing to take the box, nor even call another “corporate store” to see whether they would help us. Glad we are not ATT customers any more. I would give zero stars if I could.<//Text>

< Review>
I would give it more stars, but I found out how rude the staff can be. I arrived on time for my appointment, but they brought me in almost 10 minutes late. The person that did my massage cut it short and I know because I was keeping track of time. However, I brought this to the attention of the lady at the front desk. She just dismissed it without any acknowledgement whatsoever. I didn't tip my masseuse much because of the fact she brought me In the room late and was very dismissive.  I was disappointed. Also, the lady at the front desk got upset because I didn't tip much, but there was no need to take it personal. They're turning away good people who just want to relax and have a good experience. By the way, I asked the lady at the front desk for thanks, and she just threw the money in on the table carelessly. Not coming here agin.</Review>

I like this spot. It’s close to work! They always have availability. And they get the job done. You get what you pay for. Plus it’s cool to walk down and get a Boba on the 1st level. A good friend Recommended this place. Only down side, maybe a bit noisy from time to time. Not bad tho.<//review>

I can honestly say it was the best massage I have had, out of dozens, maybe hundreds. I came for a 2 hour massage, half-swedish, half deep tissue. The deep tissue hurt, but it was one of those "You asked for deep tissue, get ready" massages. I left feeling amazing and looser than I have after a massage in a while. I plan on coming back soon!< /Text>

The massage girl was quite aggressive with my massage. I'm sore from a massage i had yesterday. If you want a very uncomfortable painful massage come get it here. Only upside is the price.</text>

Monthly visits here are what I consider my HEALTHCARE

I’ve been getting regular massages since I had back problems back in 2007, so I’ve been to 8-10 different massage places throughout southern CA. While their amenities are subpar, their masseuses are excellent.  I come here regularly and tip BIG for a reason ;-).  They seem to specialize in Thai massage based on the ceiling bars in every room.  Their affordability allows me to come here 2 times a month.

I only wish they had another location to service me closer in Inglewood & some better music in their mix.< /Text>

<review>Here's what they offer - sexual favors instead of legit massages, stalking married man clients, sending inappropriate text messages and sexy pictures to your men. DO NOT SEND YOUR MEN OR GO THERE. ESPECIALLY TO IRENE.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>Pretty good place.  Service was excellent.  Most of the food was really good. The only complaint or negative really would be the "seasonal vegetables" an alternative to fries which weren't cooked thru and had very little flavor at that. It's weird to combine brussels and root veggies.  It just didn't work texture or taste wise.  Hopefully they fix that otherwise the chicken sandwich (grilled instead of fried) was epic flavors + thanks to our server for making that recommendation!<//Review>< username>

We visited during covid. Outdoor dining and the team wore protection.

Food was good but the wings were so spicy. If that’s your thing, great, but for me it was too much.

Pizza is smaller than described but tasty.

Would return< /review>

<Text>With consistent A+ service, high quality seafood dishes and uniquely prepared cocktails, Tower 12 has become one of my very favorites. Phenomenal service by Bree on this visit, my friend and I ordered the same items that were as delicious as before – fresh halibut sashimi and tuna poke avocado with a zest. The only negative is that their cocktails are so delicious but it’s tough to decide which one to try each time! A pretty good problem to have, as they are always “out of this world.” Family owned and run, Tower 12 has always provided the friendliest professional service, and I leave, already excited to return.< /Text><gmapID>0x80c2b378e2573aef:0x729de4fd4dba11b0<//gmapID>< Resp>

They have a great covid setup. You can be inside the restaurant! But there are enough windows and a patio feel so I guess they're able to offer this option. Food is good and they have a nice beer menu. I was able to be seated immediately. But I was there on a Monday night. So you might want to call ahead. It's on the second floor and the entrance is down a little corridor on pier on the north side.<//review>

<Text>Honestly if you black go literally anywhere but here. My friends and I were discriminated against by the hostess, manager, and a customer. We were denied entry due to “capacity” and couldn’t even have our names on the list. Yet after denying entry to myself and two other people we watched a group of ten enter. Basically if you black, trust me it’s other restaurants, better restaurants.</Text>< Pictures>

Originally my friends and I were seated at the bar area. However we wanted more privacy. Cody hooked us up and sat us at a table. Cody was so sweet and had great vibes! The sangria and fries were delicious. Will be returning!<//text>

I wasn't sure what to expect from Senegalese food, but I heard many good things about this place.  And the fact that it is in the Mission where many GREAT restaurants are, that added to it's credibility.  It was very crowded, but to me that is a good sign.  We had a group of about 10 or more and they accommodated us once our party arrived.  The service was great and the food was delicious!  Everyone in our party enjoyed their meal.  The fried plantains were a great way to start the meal, highly recommend you try it!  This restaurant was also pretty vegetarian friendly.</review>

They tell us the wait is 1.5 hours when we were meeting a party inside for a birthday. Never coming here again, waste of time. The whole area is not worth over an hour wait.< /Text>

<review>Wanted the short rib, but they didn't have it. They must have been short staffed because the waitress seemed very stressed out. She did her best. I had the burger, which was good, not outstanding. The donut holes were very good.<//review>< Pics>

<Text>Love this spot. Cool atmosphere with open air which is perfect by the beach. Friendly and fast bartenders that make yummy drinks! I had a few too maybe Southside of the pier. Very nice drink.

The food was great. Hot wings were hot and delicious. Prosciutto toast was really tasty. Nice for a light dinner.

Loved the DJ. Great mix of music. Good crowd. We had a great time!!< /Text>< rate>

Terrible experience. Was recommended by neighboring eatery that was closing for the evening. We are a mature couple and was pretty much ignored by the staff once we ordered our food. Had to ask for water refills multiple times. Ordered martini’s, received Tito’s vodka straight up, was told that is how they make martini’s. NOT ok, I would’ve asked for a shaken shot of vodka if that’s what I wanted. Ordered the margherita pizza, it was delicious, but soggy.
Probably great for people that like loud music and fruity drinks.< /Review>

We made reservations for a big group.  They were helpful and patient.  It was a mellow vibe.  We came during happy hour and the beers were massive. We ordered meatballs, deep fried cauliflower, sliders, sandwiches, pizzas etc.

It turned into karaoke at 9pm on a Thursday.  Then it got crowded.  Too crowded.  A lot of baseball hats.  Bro city.< /text>

We had Bloody Mary's.  The were adorned with deep fried bacon wrapped blue cheese stuffed olives.  Then had soft pretzels with cheese fondue that tasted like Welsh rarebit.  Waitress was friendly, helpful and attentive.  View from the upper deck was fun.  We will be back.</Text>

Located centrally by the pier and great for people watching since it is elevated above overlooking the walkway to the pier. Great menu selection and make sure you try the pretzel fondue.  The stuffed pizza is also amazing.  Prices are also reasonable.< /Text>

Wait outside wasn’t too bad, service was professionally friendly. Food was very decent for a sports bar-ish restaurant. The salad was excellent the pizza a bit soggy but otherwise  ok.</text>

Bouncers only let their friends in at night. Old folks during the day. Place is cool, foods alright, worth stopping in otherwise plenty of other places on Hermosa Pier<//Text>

<Text>I'm here on business for the week and decided I needed to come here twice this week. The first time I got an exquisite rustic vegetable salad.

Tonight I came back for comfort food. The chicken pot pie, pretzel and cheese, and brown butter mashed potatoes made for one legendary comfort food experience. And over looking the coolness of some restaurants on the Hermosa Beach Promenade.

My waiter was attentive and excellent. 😎👍<//Text>< Pics>

The unlabeled hot sauce eye droppers that get served with certain menu items (eg brisket) are reused multiple times in a night without cleaning. This was confirmed by two separate employees while I was there tonight. This is a condiment that is served on your plate and appeares to be single serving. Unfortunately, it is not single serving.<//Text>

Wow it's been almost a decade since I ventured out into the hermosa beach nightlife. This place has SERIOUSLY upgraded. The vibe is clean and beachy and also sort of upscale. Bartenders and staff were incredibly friendly. Had a great birthday event for my cousin and had a ton of fun. Really enjoyed ourselves. Parking was easy. Not too crowded. Prices were typical. Drinks were strong. Food was decent. Cops n security were more laid back then I remember from when I was younger. Will definitely be back.< /text>

They suggested reservations so we made them, walked a bit more along the strand and then returned for late dinner. The food was excellent and service was quite good in spite of crowd. A bit noisy due to crowd but balcony was beautiful and we still were able to have a conversation<//Review>< user_id>

<Review>It was my first time there, The music was off the hook, some band Roots of mine was playing, wow great music the door man was awesome, very helpful, the person who let me know where the ladies room was, thank you, as for the service in the bar area, was THERE anyone but the bartender there to service the customer?  I hollered to someone who I thought worked there, for a menu, and HE just walked on by, and went to next table and took there ORDER. Not once was I acknowledge. By any staff member. Or offered a menu. I went on line to check the prices and there were none posted on the menu, as for the cleanliness the women trashcan could have used a trash liner.  Should have been nice to try the food, I was looking forward to it. Maybe next time<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

This place is suuuuper cool. It can get really packed at times but it seems like it's pretty chill during the weekdays in the afternoon time. I really wish I could make their happy hour during the week which ends at 6pm but Tower 12 still worth going to. During happy hour, everything is extremely cheap. I've never had so much great food and drinks for such a low cost. If you miss the happy hour, it's better waiting until the next day</Text>

<text>I went to Tower 12 today to meet a friend from the East Coast who was visiting in town. We wanted to pick a place that was low-key and casual but had good food and a good atmosphere. We were not disappointed. The proprietor was the nicest gentleman and made me feel right at home the minute I sat down at the bar while I waited for my friend to join me. We had a long discussion about music and about the local beach scene. Our food was very good we had the Hawaiian style pizza meatball sliders and truffle fries. All of the food was very good served at the right temperature with all the right condiments. They have a good selection of beers on tap. I'm one of the best things was just the location itself period on a hot summer day it was nice to have a little breeze flowing through an open-air space where we could keep cool and still feel like we are outside enjoying the beach. I would definitely go back there again thank you for the great experience?< /text>< Pics>

<date>1582711171926< /date><review>Tonight I had the misfortune of running into a manager tonight by the name of Rodrigo. My sister and I asked an extremely friendly waitress that served us about a Mardi Gra bead  competition that was going on. We asked her two questions is the competition still going and if so how long. The waitress came back at around 9:40 pm and told us the competition ended at 11:00pm we asked 3 other employees working the bar and the door the same question they all said it ended at 11pm we told the guy at the door we would be back. We came back with almost 50 beads compared to every one elses 5 and 8 when we ran into Rodrigo at around 10:51 pm he let us know the competition ended at 11pm me and my sister thought great we will take the cash prize and by more drinks in 9 minutes... 2 minutes later Rodrigo tells us, the manager on duty changed his mind and the competition ended at 1 am in the morning which technically is a whole other day but we said we would rock it out. We got friendly with a female and a male bartender and asked them who is the manager on duty and imagine to our surprise they both said the manager was Rodrigo. We stayed and noticed no one else must know about the competition because literally every one had the maximum of 10 beads... we just about forgot about the competition when we ordered 2 more drinks and started zoning out to the music at the bar when Rodrigo asked us what are we waiting for. My sister responded to this extremely poor customer service and said were waiting on you. We then told him it was a little unfair to tell us the competition ended at one time but it's fine we will wait he responded and said  and I quote " I cannot change the time " me and my sister were extremely astonished at this customer service. Since we never go any where, what with my busy work and school schedule and her working for the police department we never have time to enjoy ourselves... we finally get to 1pm me and her are extremely tired and are ready to go when Rodrigo walks up to us and asks where are my Beads, since they were extremely heavy and was sitting on my neck for 4 hours I put them in my purse. he disappears and brings some random caucasian woman from the back with nearly 106 necklaces who hadn't been there all night. All the employees seemed to be very fond of this women which Is when I knew it was rigged. I was extremely dissatisfied and disappointed at this point the beads and the money meant absolutely nothing but for it to be the last day of Mardi gra and there to be no announcement, they didnt even stop the music they just crowned this girl that they gave beads too that everyone seemed to know (all 7 customers in the club lol) and I decided to walk out. I even asked him why are they making an announcement of who won the competition and he said to keep "we dont need to make an announcement " that is when I knew for sure they just through beads on this girl. I am not sure how Rodrigo (if this is even his real name) is still a manager but rest assured I will NEVER be back there as long as he is running things and i Highly recommended you dont either . patrick molloys has the BEST customer service and they are fair , i realize that's too much to ask for these days . I could not believe that I was treated so poorly and yes you already know what color my skin is by the way I was treated by Rodrigo...  if I could give just him negative stars I DEFINITELY would . Do not visit this establishment ESPECIALLY if you want a chill night, good music and good customer service and since sharkeez and this place is run by the same ppl please avoid at all costs ...< /review><UserId.>107077707497699170379</UserId.>< Gmap_id>

The drinks were amazing! When we were seated it was in a cozy little couch area. We order the pretzels, with cheese and hot mustard. Delicious! My friend and I split the mushrooms pizza and ahi poke stack. They both were yummy! I put their spicy sauce on the pizza it just made it that much better. We had a couple draft beers with our lunch. Our server was so sweet and helpfully. Definitely a must go spot in Hermosa!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

< Review>
They have deal of one free pizza per 10 people. The pizza is about 9 inches in diameter and the only half priced drinks are fishbowls (totally worth it if you don't have work the next day). My group ordered the stuff crust which had mixed reviews between us. It's an ALL ricotta and herbs mix inside of what is basically a bread roll affixed to paper thin crust. The wings are awesome, with perfect "hot wing sauce". Their naughty mermaid drink is nice and light.</Review>

Watched as this place was being built out and suspected it would be a formula-bland watering hole, eatery. Not at all! This is a really cool bar/restaurant. Not sure I would classify it as a destination place yet, as in put it on your hit list if coming from out of town, but it is absolutely on the hit list if you are already in town. Check it out, you will enjoy!< /Review>

<text>Located up above Pier Ave, there are two sides to the establishment. The side facing the Pier Ave is the restaurant/bar area. The service is fast, good good for bar food, and the view great for people watching. It can get crazy busy here, especially in the evenings and weekends. A good place to go if you're looking for casual but better than most bar food!</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Text>2nd trip to Hermosa Beach and 2nd visit to Tower 21. The first visit was pretty good, so thought we'd come back again.  The best part of the visit was the wedge salad.  That's where the good ended.  Ordered buffalo wings ... and for a dozen at $18 you'd think they'd be good.  These were dried out, cold, and tasted as if they were days old.  Told the waitress (,showed her actually) and all she said was sorry.  No other to fix it, replace it, comp it,  etc.  Just sorry.  Also, waited over 20 minutes for 5 garlic butter shrimp to be made.  Overall simply disappointing.<//Text></record>

The food was good, we got pretzels and the cheese steak bites and I would definitely get them again. The dinner portion was even better, the stuffed crust meat feast lives up to its name. Wouldn't go here if you wanted to talk a lot though, it was loud enough that we were shouting to hear each other.<//review>

Popular bar and a great selection of beer. More popular at night usually with a line and cover fee(not sure why though).</review>

I was hesitant when a new bar came in and replaced the iconic FFFF but Tower 12 lives up to the location. They did a full remodel and the inside is super clean and sleek... think Nantucket Beach Bar vibe with amazing cocktails and food and super cook decor. For a place right on the beach the prices are totally reasonable too! All the staff is super friendly and they even kept the 6-Second Beer Challenge (FFFF Fans will know what I’m talking about). Last time we were in manager Will came up, checked on us, and made some awesome recommendations. He was totally awesome and embodies the overall feel of the place. I highly recommend if you’re in the area you check it out!<//text>

Very expensive but there is a good crowd, they try to.make the back room a concert venue.. it's ok, but not ideal..
It definitely can be a good time</Text>

Mediocre food at best. Poke is covered in an avocado-like sauce then covered even more with a spicy sauce ... Can't even take the poke (maybe on purpose?).  Pretzle bites are just bread in the shape of pretzles and are super hard on the bottom.

Great view and atmosphere.</text>

Disappointed with the visit. My husband and I placed our order and only one dish came out. Asked our server where the other order was she said she only placed one order. The manager didn’t seem to concerned about the mistake he comped our two glasses of wine , we walked out didn’t drink our wine we just wanted out of there.< /text>

I ordered the fried cauliflower and a side of broccoloni. Everything was delicious, and I will definitely be visiting again. Popular spot for drinking and dancing on weekends, but the mixed drinks are pricey and very watered down.<//Text>

To all of you innocent fools who think you won a pizza party: they giving  personal/appitizier pizzas. Each pizza only feeds one person...out of the ten that you invited. Additionally, the cheapest half off drink is over $60. Even the waiters are frustrated with this scam!</Text>

<review>Atmosphere  and vibe is one of the best in Hermosa if not the best. They have all kind of set up in there , 2 bars , couches to sit and have conversation, dancing area , live music some days and they serve food although food is overpriced and portions are small . It is worth to check it out for couple drinks and have a good time .</review>< resp>

If I could rate this place 0 stars I would. Unfortunately, this review is based on the culture of this establishment and not on its food. BOTTOM LINE THIS PLACE IS A RACIST ESTABLISHMENT so I definitely WOULD NOT RECOMMEND anyone to it for sure. On 6/2/17 I nicely went up to the gentlemen at the door and asked if they were letting anyone else in and he politely said no. At this point I didn't think anything of it since it was close to 1.  What I saw after is what pissed me off. They let two separate groups of white folks in right after they said they weren't letting anyone else in. That's BS to me. My group of friends watched this all go down... they wouldn't let a group of black and asian folks go in but they sure let white folks go in. I was super disappointed to say the least as I love going to Hermosa Beach and frequent there often. I have never come across this type of behavior at other establishments on the pier. I thought it was important and necessary to say something to the gentlemen I previously spoke with. As I walked back to try to speak to him,  he was acting like he didn't see me even though I was the only person in the vicinity along with the doorman. Since he wasn't trying to talk to me, I told the doorman in a professional manner that it was disappointing to see them letting people in after they just told me they weren't letting anyone else in. At this point the gentlemen decided to make a statement and defend himself saying it's not what you think. I reiterate that it doesn't look good when you just told me you weren't letting people in and immediately after let a group of white folks in but deny entrance to people of various ethnic backgrounds. His defense was they were service industry people. Sorry buddy that excuse doesn't fly especially when two separate groups go in from two separate areas. I've worked years in the service industry so I can acknowledge that we would frequent other bars after our shift ends but not in the manner that these folks were dressed. Cmon y'all knew what you were doing ... let's be real here. I don't use the word racist lightly when accusing someone of it without merit. I would hands down say STAY AWAY FROM THIS ESTABLISHMENT ... super disappointing.<//Text>

<review>Overrated place that seems a bit too overpriced. And they security guy at the door is not good at his job. Unfriendly to patrons. He alone made me never want to go back there. Decent chicken sandwich though.< /review>< date>

<review>Sorry gotta rant. Always a long line. Came down here to sign someone up as a favor for the hermosa beach iron man. Idk why they would do it in such a busy small restaurant. The door guy is new and has no idea what he's doing and panicked when I asked him a simple question as he told me to wait in a long line w the people who are there to Dine but let his friends pass through. Hmmmm. Called a manager to explain management needs to organize the front door and was hung up on. I wanted to dine here while on vacation but I'm set off by rude people and poor service.< /review>< rating>
