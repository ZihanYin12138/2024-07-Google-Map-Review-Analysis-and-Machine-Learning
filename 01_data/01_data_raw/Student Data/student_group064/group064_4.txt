<text>The customer service is a absolutely horrible!
You have to wait around, what seems like 10 min just for the 99 cent ice cream, even though the whole place is a ghost town.

Both of the hunting games told me that i had "played too many consecutive games" even though i just finished one hunting campaign & I wanted to do a 2nd one.

This place just keeps getting worse. Not worth your time.<//text><user_id>109706478931041197577< /user_id>< Response>

<review>Help me understand something, you want to charge per lane at 75$ and then charge 20$ per person for a 10 person party for 90mins and then charge me 28.28 for a pitcher of beer that had hair in it?

< Review>
First time going here and maybe the last. Very poor customer service and Pam the manager was awful (hopefully thats her name because when I asked her name she covered her name tag with her left hand). Tall skinny blonde girl.  I was looking at the hotwheels and there were 170 tickets as stated on the tag. When I got to the counter she said it's more. I told her and they verified it was in the wrong place which wasn't my fault but the printed tag states DC car. She wouldn't give it to me. I asked for a higher person like district or corporate and she said there isn't one and that the number is on the website. I checked website and there wasn't a number. There was actually someone higher then her which came and helped me out. So she was lying for sure. Very bad customer service...<//Review>

This place has so many grabby games and so many workers to help you. I hope they keep this place stays as clean and fast (months from now) as they did at the grabby game section as they did today. Friday from 530-7pm play time. Kids loved it. The grabbers are very winnable and unique, it's all about technique. A little bit pricier than Dave and Busters but its cleaner better maintained and better payout. Love it. Will return soon. It's a 60+mile drive for us to get here. Way worth it for a fun day event for kids and adults.<//review>

<Review>Pretty cool place. It's got a good size arcade, about 12 bowling lanes, a bar for the adults, snack place to get something to eat and some pool tables. It's a nice addition to the mall and I'm happy to have it close to me. I only played around in the arcade with the kids and it's a little expensive. The use the reloadable cards like most places do now. I like that all your "tickets" get added to the card so you don't have to carry them around. I didn't like that some games cost a fraction of a credit. I know it's a way to keep you playing and always have credits on the card but really why should a game cost 6.8 credits. Just make sure you keep the card so you don't have to buy another one after your first  purchase. All in all it a nice clean place and all the games I played worked so that's always a plus. I say go and check it out.< /Review>< Pics>

<Rate>3< /Rate><Text>This review is based on comparison to the Japan round 1 establishment. Unfortunately I came here with high expectations of having a great experience like I did at the round one establishments I attended  while I lived in Japan. $25 in Japan gets you access to three floors of arcades, darts, pool halls, ping pong, boxing, indoor skating, batting cage, basketball courts, archery just to name a few.

Unfortunately this is just like a Dave and busters, memberships and different level player club cards. You can get a $10 card for 60 min unlimited game play at anything that lights up green, however most of them are old games that not many want to play. Getting the multicolor is the best option if you want to enjoy the entire establishment but expect to pay a good amount  for that access.

The place is conviniently located at the mall. The crowd was normal, not a lot of wait time to play video games, small bowling alley and pool hall.

It would be great if they would apply some of the Japan business practices. Perhaps getting a bigger place maybe the 2nd floor?

Anyways overall a good spot to take your kids or go have a drink and play games with friends.<//Text><user_id>100476365517296392012</user_id>< user_name>

<Review>GREAT place to have family fun. Some people don't appreciate this place has rules.They are there for a reason. Drinking is prohibited in the Karaoke/Party Rooms to avoid issue's such as underage drinking etc...They also don't wish to lose their liquor license, so preferably, they are strick on ID Policy. So much more fun then Dave and Buster's with MUCH more to do. They do have a good deal on Bowling when you rent the lane by the Hour. There are 325 Arcade Games  and ALL Brand New. The Bar is FANTASTIC and well Managed with Big Screen TV'S everywhere .Pizza at the Snack Bar is my favorite food item they sell, pretty good stuff. I love this place!!!!!</Review>< UserId.>

Fun place to play pool or bowling. The games are expensive, just be aware, but are usually always working. We rarely play the games, almost always play Pool. The Pool tables are clean and we'll taken care of. It's fairly easy to grab a beer and enjoy yourself. One downside is the extremely loud and constant announcements, reminding you they don't serve alcohol to minors. Another is the food is bland, not bad, just bland. The staff is always ready to help.<//review>

I worked my tail off to get accepted into Cal State San Diego as a first generation immigrant and it hurts to see that I was not able to get to enjoy my celebration because I was not able to provide proof of “real” ID due to legal reasons I am not in control of. I showed them my high school and college ID and still they enforced me to leave with rude service. And to top it all off the security guard who is around 5’2 and I’m being generous, with curly hair and glasses followed me throughout the arcade and I felt that I was targeted. This is the worst experience living in the United States since I have been here 1/10<//Review>< pictures>

AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
management is a joke, and disrespectful. I made a complaint about the service of the bartender, or lack there of, and was mocked and harassed by Eric the manager who used foul language when conversing with me. I am not sensitive to that but it is extremely unprofessional, I was shocked and even made a comment to Eric about how unprofessional it was and he continued to do it. After nothing of our dispute was settled Eric left, later on we were refused service from the bar with no explanation, the assumption we’ve made is because we complained. That is textbook harassment and retaliation in the eyes of EEO and customer service. We requested the manager to return, he had a snarky attitude and continued to use foul language and offered to fix nothing. He could not provide us with a reason we were being denied service, then eventually came up with the lie that we were causing problems and wasting his employees time. The people in the lanes around us were laughing at this statement, we were all pretty much in shock. I didn’t know this was a COMMUNIST establishment. I was blunt but respectful and never threatening towards the manager and he eventually threatened me saying that the police were outside and he didn’t want to have to call them in. This was a hysterical statement and I immediately welcomed the company of our boys in blue. The officer approaches and I apologized for the establishment wasting his time. The officer stayed for about 15 seconds and said maybe 2 words and it seemed he has history with this place and these managers. Eric then asked us to leave and kicked us out forfeiting the rest of our bowling time, no reason was offered other than that we were causing problems. Apparently if you complain you are causing problems.

After all that, if you like bowling the lanes suck and the scoring is glitchy, lighting is terrible as well.

And if you’re doubting the character of our crowd, we are professionals and act accordingly. We had a police officer, nurse, fire fighter and two Physician Assistants in our group.

Finally, this was the worst experience I have ever had at an establishment hands down, don’t complain or they will call the police and kick you out. Eric is a joke of a manager, completely worthless and had no idea what being a manager entails.

Also, this was the short version of or story, there was many other smaller factors that play into our review, I honestly can’t think of one good thing to say about this place.

AVOID!!!<//Review>

<Review>AWESOME! Something for the whole family to enjoy.  From Billiards to video games" Round 1 is the place to go unwind with the family or a night out with friends.  Bowling lanes were great! The Billiards room has 6 pool tables and is located by the Round 1 Bar... Yes a Bar complete with Big screen TVs showing sports games, and food.  Fabulous prices.
Extra large claw machines filled with the cutest stuffed toys and the latest in arcade games. This is an awesome addition to our already awesome town!< /Review>< pictures>

I won't be returning every again. If you're thinking about renting one of the party rooms here, just don't do it. They will expect you to leave your drinks, that you purchased at their establishment, on a table outside of the room unattended. Unattended near underaged teens, children, and adults...so because we felt uncomfortable about this, we opened the door, moved the table, and stood outside of the room with our drinks so we could still be engaged with the people that were still in the room. Security immediately came and demanded that we move the table, so we did. We stood outside of the room without the table and with our drinks in hand. The manager then comes and states that even the tip of my shoe being over the room line counted as me having my drink in the room. Long story short, security continued to harass us all night. We are all a bunch of professional adults who were just trying to have a good time. No one was acting inappropriately. The manager and security seemed set on enforcing the rule even down to the pettiness of my toe. On top of it all, the karaoke system wasn't working and we mentioned it to management multiple times. They were too concerned about us and our drinks to help us fix this problem. We were really looking forward to doing karaoke here and it was such a bust. Don't waste your money.< /review>

This place is great tons of games that you can spend hours playing if you have the money. There are memberships to pay less and play more. They have karaoke and Bolling. But with the Bolling there is very few lanes I believe about 5.<//Text>

Good food. Really cool place. Prices for bowling, and billiards was pretty good. The arcade games were outrageous!!!! Each game takes anywhere from 5-12 credits a piece!! The virtual reality game was 24 credits!!! They have a cool summer bowling pass that's reasonably priced. They have some pretty cool games, but to me it's just not worth the money. They do have food and a bar.</review>

The arcade game selection is fantastic. A mix of games you can get decent play for the credits and others that will eat up your credits before you know what happened. Bowling was fun and the technology around the lanes was state-of-the-art. However, the shoes have grip on the heels, which I wasn’t aware of at first, causing me to stumble and then adjust my approach for the rest of the game. The pizza was FANTASTIC. We would go back just to eat the pizza!<//text>

Wasn't the best experience. Power went out. Took about an hour to reload. I paid for two bowling games but by the time we ended the 1st one after the hour wait it was too late to have the second game do we kingly asked for a refund but was denied and given a voucher. For this situation I feel we should have been given a refund for the 2nd bowling game. I guess rules are rules.< /review>

We had my daughter's Birthday here yesterday and my host was not helpful at all. We waisted a lot of time waiting for things that should have already been set up prior to out arrival. The party kids never received their ice cream, I was overcharged,  and the party rooms are pretty warm. I had people sweating in their. The food was good , but we won't be having another party here.</Text>

If you're a fan of Dave & Buster's, then just make the extra drive and go there and skip this place. It's really expensive. It takes a lot of tokens per game, and for little yield on tickets. The games remind me phone apps blown up super size. Nothing exciting. There's no restaurant like D&B has. You have to go to a kiosk, type in your order, pay, then take the paid ticket to the counter and they will prepare food. Then they call a number and you can pick up your food to eat. not that the food in Dave and Buster's is fantastic or anything, but this food is definitely subpar. There is extremely limited seating. I think there are three booths and a handful of tables. Again, if you're looking more of a D&B experience then do the drive because it's much better. Oh, and the A/C was off or set too high. It was STIFLING in there!< /Text>

Me and my family really liked the place! Although, I think that the ticket currency is rigged. We had won 180 tickets each in Bowling, but when we checked our tickets, we only had 304.
I suggest trying out the car racing games. Some have surround sound and vibrations.</Review>

<text>Great place to take family or friends at. Bowling was fun and was mildly surprise that we were able to keep our shoes. My only complaint was everything was over priced expect for bowling, probably the cheapest I've seen to bowl during the week. Would recommend for other people to go to and will come back.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80db7fd79c7024df:0x7e13b0091e36428</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

It’s cool I like the bowling and the arcade I don’t recommend coming all the time because of kid’s birthdays cause the 4 hour wait but I like it since it’s not so crowded and there’s space walk to walk around.<//Review>

Great place to kill time. They need more games though. Also they need to decrease the amount you have to play per game. Other than that it was amazing.</Review>

The Bowling alley was clean and tidy. The shoes you have to rent are all new. The attendant removed balls as people left. The pool tables are new and tournament size. They charge hourly for pool which is quite a bit more expensive than "pins and pockets" in which you pay per game. Super fun place. The only problem is that the food is terrible. On the level of cafeteria food. I ordered a hamburger and it was quite bland. I recommend coming here after stopping by the food court.<//Review>

Unfortunately I have to give it at least one star to even leave a comment. But for me 3 strikes and you're out! Management is a joke with no common sense or customer skills each time I went, the third time was the last straw.
First time: Went with friends for a couple of drinks and to  hang. He was getting his new drivers license updated for the real one so DMV gave him a temporary paper along with his hole punched DL so it still has his picture but when the new one comes he doesn't have 2. Every place accepts it but here. He even showed his Firefighter ID and they wanted to be difficult so we left and took our money elsewhere where the management used common sense.
Second experience on a different day: Kids wanted to play at the arcade so we got them game cards. Our son said he didn't swipe it that many times but he thinks  one of the machines withdrew more than once. Which happens, it's a machine and they are flawed. Any other place you can  let them know and boom they'll replace the credit. Especially when you have spent money on multiple cards for multiple kids. Nope not here, they wanted to check the cameras first. Are you kidding? For a credit for a 15 year old?
Last and final this place will never get my business or money ever again: A group of working professionals and coworkers want to karaoke. We all get banded after showing our ID to order drinks. Order drinks then head to  the our assigned room. Security busts in, not politely or calmly by the way to say we can't have our drinks in the karaoke room. No reason but it's their policy. Then they said per management they have to recheck our ID’s even though we literally walked from bar to karaoke area. Fine. Our concern was why would we place our drinks on the table outside the karaoke room on the arcade floor with kids walking around to get ahold of or some jerk puts something in it. They didn't care they were pushy about no drinks inside we purchased from them. Okay fine. We stand at the door and try and enjoy ourselves. Nope not good enough because some people holding their drinks foot was crossing the entryway here comes the manager threatening to kick us out and exaggerating how many times we've been warned. He had to be reminded the first time was the drinks that we had no idea was not allowed inside and this was him letting us know our foot couldn't be near the entry. His demeanor was so rude! We of course carry on to enjoy the rest of the evening and not let it get to us. The karaoke machine was messing up so we asked for help. A rude young lady comes in with attitude and treated us like she didn't want to help. Whatever we try and brush that off. Then as I sit on the couch I see a used pad on the floor under the coffee table. How gross is that. Of course we don't want them to think it's ours so we bring it to their attention. Their response? We need to leave before they call the police. Like sir, we point out the pad and now we have to leave and then try to justify it with the whole beer that happens way before? Why would you threaten to calL the cops? For what? And did that scare  us? No because we work along side with them and they know our character, again we're professionals. Night ruined. Security wouldn't even give their names because they need to be written up for sure.
Bottom line... STAY AWAY. Don't waste your money, time, energy. The whole place, employees, security, and manager treated us horribly. And I'm not exaggerating at all. Worst 3 experiences ever!</Review>

Where do I start. It’s basically a casino for kids. 2 hour wait for a lane and we got here at 530. There is a line for the bar, but no signs that say you don’t order there. So then once you’re told you can’t get a drink you have to go to a kiosk and order. But then get back in line at the bar to pay and pick up. Long lines at both. By the time you’re ready for another drink you should have already been in line for the next drink. Lanes are super slick and affect how you bowl. Never got a second drink because the lines were so long. Spend your money at the older bowling alleys!< /Review>

This place is too expensive, and the games aren’t worth it. Food isn’t all that. Not only that, but managers give you a mocking attitude and aren’t friendly at all. Justin has an entitled, white privileged attitude.  Wouldn’t come back, I don’t recommend this place to anyone. DO NOT spend your money here.</text>

Though I am a little disappointed that this location doesn't have Tekken, that alone can't take away from the fact that this place still has a wide selection of very fun games as well as some Japanese rhythm game imports.< /text>

<Text>This relatively new arcade opened in the Promenade mall where downstairs Sears use to be. It's nice on the inside. There are arcade games, claw machine games, a prize center, bar for alcoholic drinks, and bowling lanes. This place usually seems to be busy and this holds true on weekends. The facilities are pretty clean for the amount of people who are in the building which is always a positive. The only downside would be the lack of space to move around since many of the arcade machines are close to each other. Prices for "tokens" are also expensive given its location in the mall. Overall I would highly recommend, even if you dont play any games it's still fun to walk around there an see all the games they offer.</Text><time>1576954462828<//time></record>

The boiling was great the lanes was incredible. But the claw machines are rigged and I got half in the hole but the head was sticking up and they did not give it to me and they were stingy I spent 40 bucks and it went down the drain I was so upset< /review>

Love Round 1, this particular one is a bit new but decked with most of the nitty gritty of the core games. Apart from being a tad far & needing R1 in San Diego, the staff here has been the worst out of any the SoCal Round 1, I consider still using the LA locations often based on that fact and the arcade culture being more friendly. That's the reason for docked star... San Diego has the culture and many mom&pop barcades, it's only lacking the R1.  Temecula's management isn't likely going to improve soon, and to be honest I'm certain it has nothing to do with the actual higher R1 management; the managers at this location are actually pretty decent, and have done a great job.  However it's the staff that seems to make very questionable judgement calls considering they're job is to make R1 money instead of drive away customers with their [in]considerations.</Review>

Came to this one because the Santa Ana location said they'd sent my wife and i's favorite game to this location, wasn't there.  Worse than that I got told I couldn't use my card with money on it from their other location because they're on a "new system" so I was told I'd need to buy and load a new card.  Felt big and clean but I'd avoid until a little later.  I'll update my review if my next experience is better.<//review>

<rate>1</rate><Text>What a joke this place is!!  I’d give it a zero stars if possible.  Owners need to hire new people to run their business that actually care about the customers spending the crazy money we do for games!
We’re told 10 min. for a bowling lane,  after three visits to the counter and told they would get the lane ready in a few more minutes we ended up leaving after an hour!
My wife went up to speak with the manager in charge and he basically argued back that he didn’t believe anyone would’ve told us what they did or it would take 10 min.
I’ll take my business to other bowling alleys or to Mulligans fun center down the road and be sure to tell all our family that lives local.

Fun atmosphere and upbeat music...but that's about it. Had to stand in a roped-off line to buy a drink even though the bar seats were empty. They close at 2am but we could not get a lane or buy beer at 1:15. What? I guess they are more concerned with cleaning up and leaving, than having guests spend money and enjoy the business until closing. Since we couldn't bowl or drink at 1:15, we decided to play video games. I went to recharge my card at 1:35am and all card machines were shut down. We will not be coming back.</Review>

<Text>Great games and open layout. However Round 1 has at least 50 employees on the floor, 30 of them standing around while 2 people ran the food bar, waited 20 mins in line and 10mins for the food...which was really not bad(food). Justin the Manager..personally watched him not only ignore myself but 2 other guests trying to order drinks. I understand the place is new but not overly busy.

Way overpriced! Bowling only one game with 5 people cost $50. Anywhere else would be under $15. Ridiculous prices! The claw machines are also totally rigged and dont even clamp down at all. Also, the air hockey game only let's you play for ~3 minutes before it shuts off. Go elsewhere. This place is way too pricey.< /Review>

<Review>Been here a few times and EVERY single time the line to reload is long as well as wait time. Usually with 2 young poorly trained individuals who lack common customer service skills. I only waited in line because the self service kiosk to reload was malfunctioning plus you are unable to receive bonus points at the self service kiosk (stupid, I KNOW!). Tonight with a big group which included 7 kids & 3 adults we were conflicted with the service provided. Waited in line for 20mins while watching the line grow and grow and 2 employees having long unnecessary conversations with customers as management stands there doing nothing to help the obvious need to attend to other PAYING customers. When my turn came, I was not acknowledge with, "Sorry, be right with you" but a hey lets ignore people standing in line, talk with each other, giggle and help people who cut the line to receive credit first!!! Pam or whatever this employees name is, needs to be genuinely apologetic when she is in the wrong. She was very rude and finally moving quick when I said something. If she had the ability to move quickly to begin with, why cant she be like that with everyone else? That would help keep customers happy and wait times shorter which in turn is more money for Round 1 (no brainer) but they would rather have frustrated customers leave. Management needs to fix these issues and train accordingly. DO NOT have over 20 workers and customer service & efficiency lacks. RIDICULOUS.

Also, music is not family friendly. It felt like we took our kids to a club to go dancing. Very disappointed.<//Review>< rate>

Game machines constantly broken had to get credits redeemed 3 separate time before I gave up on the 4th and 5th game stealing credits. Wouldn’t be a big deal if every game wasn’t so expensive. Pool cost 15$ An hr when it’s slow and nobodies playing. Should really fix that. Besides the beer being cheap there’s really nothing here but a bunch of over priced bull</Text>

<review>Horrible experience!  We were feeling the environment out with a new born (7 month) baby...  While picturing our future bringing our children here and spending lots of money in the future... We were mobbed / Set-up, attacked, and harassed by the staff and Management for not spending money at that precise moment.  Totally offensive!  Disgusting behavior by the staff and management.  An investor / owner was there and didn't care to mitigate the problem.  Claimed he didn't speak English.  Questionable where the money came from for investment.  Will not spend a penny at this place.  We patronize the Mall every morning at least 3 times a week.  Spend a lot of money at other stores.  This morning I walked by Round 1 and don't even want to look at the place now.  Will probably choose another Mall to visit everyday.    Will stick with Dave & Busters too!< /review>< gmap_id>

NO STAR!!!! VEEERRY BAD EXPERIENCE!!!

Manager on Duty at night name Erik is very unprofessional  , rude and possess poor and very bad management skills . We asked the policy for Karaoke wait times as we were initially told 20 minutes wait .  25 mins later to follow up and we were told again to wait for  another 15 mins . We came back 3 more times after only to get the same response of longer wait times . Total wait times is almost 1 hour 45 mins and we finally asked the Manager on duty for clarification of their policy for reservations and further assistance. Apparently this person  in charge is incompetent and doesn’t know how to handle a simple guests questions instead of answering and offering resolution he walked away and just basically demonstrated to all of the staff he managed  at the counter(about 6 of them ) the kind  of leader he is . No wonder the staff doesn’t have the solid information to provide to guests nor how to handle guests issued because of him- not leading by example . Our initial issue was the karaoke wait time but because of how he handled our issues , our frustrations escalated to where we will make sure that upper management and corporate will be aware and hopefully can take an immediate actions and  resolution. On the other hand , an employee name Kendra who took her time to listen to us and apologize for our very bad experience. She acted more as the Manager than the one in the current position. I’m sure this company/franchise have set guidelines and streamline process for all the services and products for customers .<//text>

When you could definitely tell that the workers need help as they were struggling.  Took 15 min. To get a drink. Alot of just standing around.

The Promenade location was very disorganized, management and supervision standing around doing nothing but talking to each other and not helping the employees that seemed that they didn't know what they were doing, took 20 minuets to get a soda, it was very hot inside. not sure if the air was even on. could not read ANY of the game instructions as they were not in English. very disappointing. i did not get a very good vibe. Might not go back and will not not be recommend it. you would think they would have their act together when this inst the first round 1.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

< review>
Sometimes I can't stand the Temecula/Murrieta snobbery. This arcade is one of the best In southern california hands down. People complain about the food and drink here just to give it 1 star and yet theres 50 other restaurants within walking distance...People are clearly missing the point. The arcade encourages people to interact and meetup, which is something our society needs more of. All the machines were in clean and perfect working order and the temperature was a comfortable 70ish, which can be tough to maintain in an arcade.  People don't just come here to bowl...they come here to have fun and entertain themselves, so stop complaining about the lack of official bowling league floorwax thickness etc... They also have private party rooms which have sound dampening, and most impotantly RENTABLE KARAOKE ROOMS. The Redemption tickets are stored on a card, so no need to carry buckets of tickets around anymore. Even better is that the prizes are actually good, they are not just an overpriced walmart radio/alarm clock, tootsie rools, green army men, or chinese finger traps. Take some time to see what this place does well and you'll have a blast!< /review>

<Text>Expensive and their credit system is made complex I think to have people leave money unused on cards. Since when does a video game cost 6.4 credits? Lame!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

I Love this Arcade, I live in it, and will say its not lacking in fighting games. Don't listen to other reviews. . Round 1 Temecula has Awesome japanese fighting games. They have Marvel vs Capcom 2 ( A Classic), and all of the dreamcast classics from 2000, with a machine that has all the fighting games u can think of in one machine. All the machines are straight from japan also.
King of Fighters 98 Final Edition
Blazblue
King of fighters 12
Persona
Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition
Capcom vs Snk 2

For a branch of a Japanese arcade chain, this location sure was lacking in Japanese arcade games, especially compared to other Socal locations like Puente Hills and Santa Ana. I make the drive to those latter two frequently and was ecstatic to hear there would be one in my back yard, but nearly all the games I usually play are either missing, like Final Fantasy Theatrhythm, Dancerush Stardom, Time Crisis, or Luigi's Mansion, or their servers are disconnected, like Groove Coaster.
Instead, the floor is graced with the likes of mobile game ports (more than usual, the most remarkable example being an unwinnable sword duel game with TWO separate cabinets) and gigantic licensed light-gun games that are just cheap knockoffs of their betters (multiple Rabbids and Walking Dead games, a Tomb Raider game with a ten foot high screen, and a Halo game whose cabinet is the size of a large shed and peddles flash level gameplay in temptation of Waypoint rewards). Barely anybody has been on those that I've seen so far.
Perhaps the notion here is that a building full of Japanese games would be too niche for a community like Temecula compared to the significantly more Asian population of the area around Puente Hills, and so they played it safe with a bunch of "normal people" content. I would get where that's coming from, but at the same time, it feels like a huge wasted opportunity. The location is very new though, so I hope they do something with it.

PS: To whoever rigged up the fighting game cabinets in the back, you mixed up the Melty Blood and the Marvel 2 setups. I had a chuckle at that. Good on you for having Melty, though.<//text>

This company is AWESOME SAUCE!!! I recently had to replace the battery for my nephew's electric scooter. The battery was pretty hard to find. When I did find it, it seemed pretty expensive. I called AtBatt and spoke to a very helpful young lady. Not only did they have the battery, BUT IT WAS HALF THE PRICE! I was really happy to get the battery at a cheap price, and the delivery was fast too! I have recommended AtBatt to all of my family and friends for batteries. I will DEFINITELY use this company again!</Text>

A very unusual LiPo battery pack that was very hard to find but At Battery had it and delivered very fast. It fit an Orascoptic head light for a dental hygienist loupe.< /text>

The two replacement 1290 batteries arrived promptly, in good condition. They were well packed, fully charged and ready to install in a APC BR1000W UPS. I installed them in about 10 minutes and the UPS was back in operation. This was about 60% cost savings over buying from other sources. Good service, good prices and quick delivery.  I will order more batteries as the need comes up... Regards, BC<//Review>

< Review>
I recently ordered two batteries for my mobility scooter. One arrived and I just thought that they would be mailed separately.  When the second one didn't arrive the next day, I gave them a call and immediately spoke with a human being. She noticed that something wasn't right with our order, apologized and said that she would get the second battery out as quickly as possible. We received the second battery in two days and I feel like this was handled very well by the company.< /Review>

Shipped fast and installed easily.
My only complaint is that I never received a detailed confirmation e-mail, and my  invoice/packing slip didn't have any  price on it.  Don't know why that would be.
I need to be reimbursed, and don't have a total to report.</review>

Simple ordering procedure, logical site construction, fair pricing; add to that fast expediting and shipping; not much to add for a satisfied customer!  OEM. Battery with above service? Yes, I wholeheartedly recommend this vendor.</review>

If I could give 0 stars I would. Two issues of fraud:

1) I ordered two (2) 9cell laptop batteries. There is no way it is a 9 cell battery as fully charged there is only 6 hours of power;

2) I upgraded and paid for 2 day shipping. Days later they told me that the site says will ship in 3-4 days. They were still past this deadline, so then they said they meant BUSINESS days. So paying for 2 day delivery means nothing. And DAYS really means BUSINESS days.

Yeah, don't buy from these fraudster hacks!</text>

Batteries arrived quickly and were wrapped up so well that they probably would have survived an explosion. Thanks for the care !< /Review>

Staff is courteous and efficient.  There is always a long waiting room wait for my appointment in this office which is only increased during pandemic period.  Am pleased with the medical treatment I have received from Dr Ghalambor so will continue to wait my turn in the office.< /review>

Dr Ghalambor was an amazing surgeon and so patient with my treatment. He took good care of me and would highly recommend him to anyone. Unfortunately, the distance for me to drive up to see him became too much. But if your close to Orange County he’s the guy to see.< /review>

Dr. Ghalambor and staff are very knowledgeable, professional and friendly. I will be having surgery soon and have no doubts I am in good hands. I came to this office as a second opinion but quickly switched and chose him for my surgeon after I could see he is highly skilled, has great communication and a great reputation.< /Review>

<Text>After completing the initial patient forms, I was escorted to an examination room by the nurse who took a history of my wrist injury and ordered xrays.  A young man completed the scans quickly and jovially.  guided me back to my room to await the PA Onil.  He arrived quickly and gently examined my wrist.  The X-rays revealed no fractures, and he determined that my pain was due to inflammation and a bit of arthritis.  He offered several courses of action, including a cortisone injection which I opted to receive.  He did not attempt to pressure me into any option but guided me in the decision.  It was virtually pain free thanks to lidocaine.  What a genuinely professional, compassionate, gracious and caring young man.  And to a person, even the parking attendant, everyone was equally kind and friendly!  I unequivocally recommend this clinic and staff!!!⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

Dr. Ghalambor is an wonderful doctor/surgeon. He has cared for myself, my mother and my mother in law, all with excellent outcomes. He spends time listening to his patients, and with the help of diagnostic tests and a thorough exam, formulates his plan of care specific to each patient. He and his amazing staff are all caring individuals who make each patient feel important. I highly recommend Dr. Ghalambor.</text>

Dr. Ghalambor has treated four of my family members to date and we cannot thank him enough for his professional skills. His knowledge is supreme.
We highly recommend him as your number one choice for your medical needs.< /review>

While my visits, with the exception of the nerve test, were brief, your assistant provided an excellent briefing regarding the impending surgery.  He informed me I would receive surgery instructions either that afternoon or soon.  As of this writing I have yet to receive them.

Such a great experience. I was taken back to a room right on time, Drs PA came in to get the X-rays and nerve tests up on the screen. Dr Ghalambor came in and we discussed the findings, we discussed options  and made decisions on next steps. I highly recommend Restore Orthopedics, Dr Carlson, Andrew Germanovich DO  and Dr Ghalambor.  The staff is always friendly and helpful.</Review>

<Review>Dr Ghalambor is an amazing surgeon. I had ruptured my right pectoralis major tendon. He repaired it using a cadaver tendon and an allograft. I had very minimal pain after surgery and have had an amazing recovery since. I was back to work within 5 months which was 6 months earlier then projected. If it wasn't for Dr. Ghalambor I couldn't imagine what shape I would be in after such a sever injury. His office staff was also very kind and helpful throughout the whole process. Thank you for all you do!!!<//Review>< pictures>

<Name>Kimberly Evans<//Name><Text>Dr. Ghalambor is by far the best upper extremity physician that I have come across.  I have been providing physical rehabilitation services for many years and treat many patients from different physicians. The patients I treat who have received treatment from Dr Ghalambor and his team have the most successful outcomes. Dr. Ghalambor provides client oriented treatment and caters to each individual’s specific needs. He does everything in his power to provide conservative treatment first before resulting to surgery. I have referred many family members to him because I know they will receive the highest quality of care!!  His office is warm and friendly, willing to help at any means necessary. I can’t say enough good things about Dr Ghalambor and his team!!!!! 😀</Text>< pictures>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Text>This was a lovely park, with a community center. There are all the basics: picnic tables, bathrooms, a children's playground, a basketball court and a curving paved walk through the beautiful green space. It's "small" (though i have seen smaller) but large enough to have a handful of parking spaces; i believe the steep green hills and irregular curves contribute most to the sense of being in nature.
I wonder how a crowd manages with the restroom (two stalls and one sink for females) in better weather, when more than a handful of people are present in the space. I imagine it's hectic whenever something's going on inside the community center. I'd like to see their schedule of events.</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUe2r9aMOabZ6abQ2phJKEQMOcii7EEe6FUYuP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNL_G0hAl32fCfPF64pduh1fiLh_0uFofWBAN4U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM25kTpmCLpIcB4If-Nj4Y42FRcFbY93xi1-y62=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPh18TMVB99r3tO4SX_51wMLPTRJIAsyC0Rc9hL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvINtTQ78IRujcM8EIHlZ4xIp6Jbl-sB5fbyZI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdn7cyo7Thg1-yqI9I52A1R1Zatjgate2wR2r3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1L7kyRcq8K1d5iijlJ5S31MA5SuyglKgt99rI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNg0FDnO4lBga9-giJYeePcxk3tW_IAckCiOWOv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOYhTjNxUtQ8WiouomvaOBm1jLEzxCbTb9UbUyI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDd5aONKvCQ0FhwLycuQtv6Z3EMrbnvpjc6bpK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80dd2cb467ac9c7b:0xe53637bb5f5e624d<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Great time with my pup ASAP restrooms were conveniently close and open there's a playground and a nice open grass area where you can have a little privacy this park does close at 8:00 in the parking lot is not too big but I'm not sure if there's another side of the park I was on the playground area. Beautiful Hill to take nice sunset pictures. Water fountain by the basketball courts and handicap accessible< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>It's always clean and there's hardly anyone there. It's a small park but there's enough space for people to bring their family and have a fun time.< /Review>< pictures>

<review>Small park surrounded by industry buildings, so not a very pretty view once there. However, it does have a basketball court their, and a decent playground area for the kiddos, but the sand all over the place really brings it down in my opinion. Anyways see pics below.<//review><user_name>Robert M</user_name><gmap_id>0x80dd2cb467ac9c7b:0xe53637bb5f5e624d< /gmap_id>< Resp>

<review>I have many memories from this place. And it may be small but has everything you need to relax a bit and take a rest from everything else. Visit it, and don't forget to keep clean for others.<//review>< Pictures>

There is also a basketball court for young and adult people. It is not large, but it has some space to walk, and a amazing landscape. The only problem with this park is the street lightning. We went there on the sunset, and it became dark really fast.There are some lighting poles, but seems that they doesn't turn on until the night come dark.<//text>< pictures>

MY 5-STAR RECOMMENDATION: The Frontier Park is located on Marquardt Avenue in the city of La Mirada, California. This park is nice and well-groomed. This park can be the next venue for your next community picnic! I would highly recommend this park.< /text>

There is a basketball court, charcoal grills, restrooms, grassy area, parking lot, a few tables, two benches, sandbox with outdoor toys for children, swings, trees, trash cans, drinking faucets, and a small recreation room. This park is gated and there are lights on the evening. Public safety officer and after school kids program Monday through Friday.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>This is a nice little park on the border of a neighborhood and an industrial area. There is a basketball court, some play equipment for the kids, bathrooms, and picnic benches.
There are plenty of trees to provide shade for your picnic lunch and it's nice and hill-y to offer some privacy from the street, since it's smaller and right off of the street.< /text>< rating>

The updates to landscaping here have really upgraded the aesthetic and atmosphere of the park. A lot more families come here now which makes it way more comfortable than before when it was just a bunch of local hoodlums. This is also partly thanks to the public safety and sheriff patrolling more frequently even after dusk.</review>

It's ok because it's not the biggest Park has swings but in my opinion I don't really like it. The people that have built it or the people that designed it should have added a little more stuff to make it look like an amazing Park.<//Review>

I was reading the reviews and I was a bit nervous about making my traffic ticket appointment over the phone. What is my surprised that the gentleman that answered the phone answered all my questions, very helpful. Then the clerk that helped me at the window was awesome. I want to believe I spent more time walking to the building than anything else. the officers were very thorough with inspections. I don’t ever want to come back to pay a ticket but this place was unbelievably AWESOME<//text>

We went there to submit a form at the clerk per the instructions online. And then you get only to be told you have to call online to make an appointment. Just goes to show everything is much more inefficient with govt.< /text>

There is paid parking here and there also is paid street parking so make sure that you have cash for the parking or change for the meters.  There are some other federal buildings here as well since pretty big. Luckily there is a directory so you can see what building you need to go to. All the buildings have security and metal detectors.

This place really tempts me to break the law, how many times do I have to submit am FL-180 to get Divorced?! This will now be the 7th time I resubmit a judgment entry. I’m not rich so can’t afford a lawyer to help. I tried the workshops...not helpful. These clerks are not friendly you’re just a number and can care less about your situation. I seriously just want to sweep my “mistake” under the rug. Depressing place. Sadly I come here often because it’s inefficient. You’re expected to figure it out on your own. God forbid you ask a question, they stare at you in the face and talk in a condescending tone. How dare you ask a question it’s almost offending them because your wasting their time. Our tax dollars are paying their salaries<//Review>

Every one of those 5 stars is for Mark, the sheriff in 102. His attention to everyone and everything in the room, along with a positive demeanoror ecourages compliance. Strict compliance with the rules, assists the bench and the public. Give this man a raise!<//text>

Worst courthouse in Los Angeles area. Very unhelpful, unprofessional and rude staff, especially in the community service department. The woman at the window aggressively circled something on MY court paper about 5 times as she proceeded to treat me disrespectfully. Must be sad to work in a court house but geez.< /review>

Fear of unknown.
You, in good conscious appear at the court room 102 for a routine traffic ticket. The room gets full and whispering starts at no time, kids hitting your seat, people talking your ears off and suddenly dead silance.

The Deputy Sheriff, so easily and comfortably takes over the room. The next thirty minutes is nothing but the most smooth, humorous, pointing, factual, and noteworthy talk you will ever encounter.

Deputy Marc Lashley, in a very attention grabbing fashion, gets your undivided attention as to what is to be occurring during the court session.

So much so that you really don't care why you are there but pray this half hour talk continue endlessly. It is informative, spoon fed to those intruptive, as well as attorneys, and other attending  officers.

The detailed procedures, options, cost, and all other relative information are well put together and presented by him.

During my two visits, I sat there and watched the ins and outs of this courtroom, and must confess that it is extremely well run, professional and well mannered staff with much kudos to Deputy Lashley who makes the visit far less dry and otherwise tenuous.

Later that day, when I misspoke at another level, in seeking alternatives to correct the situation, visibly at unrest, I met Barbara Padilla, a well dressed, soft spoken supervisor who took time to explain and offer options to remedy my particular case.

I could not have had any better coach who took time, listened to my broken explainiation and walked me through what was at play.

I left the window and the courthouse having met two new friendly advocates to keep for life. Neither had to do what they did. But they did it because of who they are, and what they do.

It all goes to the basic values of treating one another with dignity. I hope, I earned that too. The fear never settled in!</text>

This is bullshit i cant lookup my court date online, i cant call the courthouse because the phones just don't work. there is no info, no one to talk to, i cant even figure out when my court date is just for a traffic ticket. This is a scam, i never though i would be so appalled with the legal system. So now if i cant figure out my court date and if it passes a warrant will be placed for my arrest simply because the system would not even tell me whats happening. This is America?< /text>

The courthouse under renovation, the telephone system seems...Lord, can you imagine with all these people.  I believe most of the personnel and public servants are doing more than ever while a few do appear to be working against the judicial system as well as the individual.  It has been an observation that some attorney's are definitely submitting false information detrimental to the client, then utilizing court procedures to proceed without the client while lying to the court for the attorneys benefit leaving no legal recourse for anything being represented.  I don't know what to do to be heard.  He robbed my daughter and me of her adolescents and of my entire life.  How can anyone remain confident with the redirecting, malate stuff and the outrageous conduct of j. Cole.</Text>

This is a typical government web site. It's absolutely worthless. There phone system should also be removed as it's as worthless as it's web site. I've been trying to pay a MTA Camera ticket issued by the Los Angeles County Sheriff since 12/13/2015 and it's now 02/01/2016. I even called the Sheriff's Dept. Traffic Division and the officer at the Van Nuys Court House West said they could be of no help and wished me luck with trying to get it paid or even reach someone.</review>

<Review>Negative 50 stars!!! Ive been on hold for 2 days trying to get information on a mystery ticket that showed up in collections from Van Nuys. Ive never recieved anything by mail saying i got a ticket and i was never pulled over in that city. Its caused my license to be suspended and Im sitting on hold for 2 days trying to find out wth this ticket is and the automated systems just hangs up on you saying all represenitives are busy. You cant call anyone a represenitive if theyve failed to represent your facilityu at all over the phone. For all i know theres nobody even working there because ive yet to speak to a human being and it here its alm,ost the end of day 2 sitting on hold.If this isnt proof of a failed system then i dont know what is. You give out tickets to people without notifying them and then send it to collections without them being able to defend themdelves and in the end suspend their license. Then you cap it off by making it impossible to find out any info on this mystery ticket. i dont live anywhere close to van nuys so tsaking a bus would take the better half of a full work day and my license is suspendd so i cannot drive(legally). This is honestly an absolute joke. i should sue this damn city<//Review>< Resp>

One star at the very most. Unable to find ticket online, forget the phones, rude uncivilized people ALL this to get ripped off from a ticket, playing with my phone while at a red light, according to cop. How ironic they are constantly texting, how do you explain this???? If you forget....a warrant for your arrest...What? Go after real criminals.</Text>

Love this park, the only thing restrooms are a bit far from the picnic area but overall is great. I still need to check out their hiking trails, maybe bring my MTB. Park grade = A+< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Nice place to spend with the family, clean and quiet.

If you want something nice to walk or rest, it is an excellent option.

Sheldon is a rare bird. He is exceptionally knowledgeable, extremely conscientious, and he cares for each piece of audio equipment as if it were his own.

That all said, know that you will be paying a premium price for a premium service, and you will be waiting patiently for this service to be completed. You will get your money's worth, but this kind of meticulous service isn't and shouldn't be cheap or rushed.

My vintage Yamaha CR 2010 receiver went from barely working/sputtering and unreliable at best, to indistinguishable from brand new, rock solid and sounding as good as ever. I look forward to many more years of listening pleasure that I was afraid I'd lost and could never recover.</review>

<rating>5</rating><Text>"You can't hurry art" is what Sheldon told me from the beginning when I took my Marantz 140 amp to him for much needed repair/restoration. Yes, it took a long while, techs this good have quite a backlog of work. I was not in a hurry and never felt anxious about the wait. Once he got to the unit, Sheldon called and gave me two options: repair the actual problem or completely restore the unit innards (the exterior was "pristine"). I opted for the full restoration ("it will be good for another 50 years"). A couple of days later the unit was ready. When I arrived he had it playing. It not only sounded fantastic but also looked even better. Worth the wait and the price. Thank you Sheldon!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<pictures>None</pictures><Time>1627532717203<//Time><review>Brought a higher-end Denon amplifier (PMA-A100) for repair (left channel drop out), and Sheldon found a non-obvious problem with a switch to the amplification circuit.  After determining that the part (switch itself) is no longer sold, he rebuilt the broken part, taking steps to strengthen the component well beyond what was provided initially by the manufacturer.   The service was performed within the promised timeframe, and the company was clear and timely in their communication about the project.

In my experience, Champlifier proved to be very knowledgeable and capable, delivering great results at a reasonable price for the hours required to effect the repair. Sheldon made an extra effort to arrange a convenient (after-hours) time for pick-up.

Recommended for audio amplifier services.  Also, great company name!<//review>< Rating>

After giving Champlifier half of a year to make a repair and no work was completed, Champlifier was unfortunately a huge letdown.

When I found Champlifier to fix the cracked mesh on my speaker grills, I was excited by their good reviews and work portfolio. When I initially contacted owner Sheldon, he seemed confident and professional.

However, after I dropped off the speaker grills, things became strange.  First, when I asked Sheldon to provide a quote for the repair, he was extremely reluctant to provide it, saying that it would take him a lot of time and that he would need to charge me for it.  After some time and multiple conversations, and me promising him that I understood that prices in quotes fluctuate, he finally wrote one.  It was a simple quote with two items and a total estimated price - nothing special.  It's baffling that he would expect customers to agree to pay for a repair without a written price estimate and then generally insist on charging a customer for a basic one.

Fast forward six months later, Sheldon had not done any work on the repair and never even proactively provided me with an update.  After sending him emails and calling him, and him dodging me and providing excuses, I decided to pick up the speaker grills.  That day, Sheldon told me that he needed more time.  It does NOT take over six months to source mesh material and glue it on speaker grills.  I used to do model making, have worked on cars, sanded a car to bare metal and consider myself pretty handy overall.  I wanted to save myself some time and support a local business, especially during the pandemic, which has been a challenging time for businesses.

The worst part is that when I finally picked up the speaker grills, he refused to return my deposit despite the fact that he had not done any of the repair in the entire six months he had my grills.  This forced me to contact my credit card company, after which I was informed by a representative that he had told them that the repair was ready to be completed the day I picked up the speakers.  Sheldon lied in order to keep his deposit.

I am very sensitive to the fact we’re in a pandemic and businesses are experiencing many challenges.  At minimum, Sheldon should have provided me with updates without me having to chase after him and been honest about his inability to do the job when he realized he couldn't or wouldn't do it.

Stay away from Champlifier and save yourself the time, money and hassle.< /Review>

My Triad Silver subwoofer (circa 2003) stopped working and Sheldon fixed the amplifier which had damage from heat due to the closed design.  He replaced damaged components and upgraded others to higher quality in January.  The subwoofer worked for a couple of months and then failed again in March.  He repaired it this second time for no charge for labor.  It has been working fine ever since.< /Text>

<review>Great customer service.  Called about fixing a high end signal processor.  Champlifier confirmed their ability to repair but for the manufacturer's refusal to provide them with the technical data to perform the work.  If you're in the market for hi-end gear, suggest you confirm with the manufacturer that schematics and other technical support is available for customer service from the shop you choose.  Otherwise you'll be stuck having repair work done by whatever technician is willing to accept the lousy terms offered by manufacturers who won't let consumers make their own choices.   Like I said, very knowledgeable folks and I'll look forward to working with them on products with better customer support.<//review>< pictures>

I was starting to fall out of love with my 1975 Luxman l-100u integrated amplifier. This was the flagship of Luxman in its heyday, and it sounded sweet. But then it started to develop a bit of noise and crackle in the right channel, which gradually got worse. I had another shop take a look at it, they claimed to fix it, but no.

Then I took it to Sheldon. We was extremely patient and thorough as he described his process and what decisions I could make as to resolving the issue. He gave me the confidence that he really cared about his work, and the resulting music.

The problem was super tricky - intermittent, with all of the components testing in spec. To make matters worse, this is a, extremely complicated amp to work on.

After picking it up, I noted that the problem was almost gone, but not quite. The gremlin came back! Sheldon helped me troubleshoot over the phone and asked to take another look at it.

I picked it up today and have been listening to it for hours, and cannot believe how great it sounds. A completely black and transparent background, and sounding better then it ever has before!

Sheldon was fair and transparent with me on the price. In fact, I know for a fact that he put in many more hours of labor than he charged me for, and a full list of the replaced components along with pics of everything along the way.

Seriously, he is the real deal. A "transistor whisperer" and one who takes the utmost pride in his work. If you want your forever stereo to sound as good or better than the day it left the showroom, Champlifier is a worthwhile investment.< /review>

<Review>Excellent service! Cannot recommend enough. Went here on short notice with a broken rowing machine display that is no longer manufactured. Sheldon was able to repair it same day at a fair price. He was transparent and communicative about the process the whole way through. Also has the office set up safely for COVID-19, which I appreciated. Will be back for any other repair needs.<//Review><UserId.>111665632280779653396</UserId.>< gmapID>

I collect vintage McIntosh hi-fi gear.  This stuff is built to last, but as with any piece of equipment from way back in the last century, a tune-up is going to be necessary sooner or later.  The Bay Area used to be rich with electronics repair shops staffed with “old school” technicians, but they are few and far between these days.  Fortunately, I found Sheldon at Champlifier.  Sheldon is highly skilled and qualified, and approaches his work with a surgeon’s precision and a hi-fi aficionado’s enthusiasm.  I’ve brought several pieces to Sheldon so far, and each time he has been clear and up front with his assessment and meticulously thorough with his completed work.  He provides a detailed summary of all work performed, including pictures taken at different stages of the operation.  Don’t expect a fast turnaround, as he usually has a backlog of work due to his growing reputation.  But if you’re like me, and enjoy your old stuff and want to keep it running at top levels for years to come, it’s worth the wait.  Highly recommended.</text>

Music is important, so being able to play it is a wonderful thing.  Being without music is like having a broken limb.  So, when the turntable is not working  and you can't play your 33's or 45's you have to find a replacement.  I shopped around and found Champlifier!  I made an appointment and everything evolved from there!  It was a beautiful experience.  Sheldon is not only good, but a pleasure to speak with.  He is knowledgeable and sincere as he assists you to achieve your goal.  After discussing the problems and checking out my equipment, it was determine I needed something new.  Well, by the time I made my decision, I was able to leave  his shop a satisfied individual.   He is a gentle king of electronics.  Should you need help with your turntable or receiver go see him and you won't be disappointed.  Kudos to everyone in the shop!</Review>

<Text>Just hooked up a 40+ year old Accuphase E-202 after Champlifier restored, repaired and cleaned the unit.
Powering a set of JBL's 4343 Studio Monitors and sounds just like the first day I ever played the system.

<text>Four years ago, after inheriting a Linn Sondek record player and speakers, I took them to Sheldon at Champlifier. He was a one man show, who was up front and honest about the time it would take to fix things, and about the fact that the speakers I had were beyond repair. But I left with a new needle, balanced record player, and frankly awe at the acumen this man holds on stereo equipment. Recently, when my needle broke, I went back to Sheldon who hooked me up with a affordable option, gave me player a tune up and also, provided me with a rigged up fix so my broken case would operate again! He is deeply invested in providing great service, and wonderful conversation. Yes, it may take time, but frankly, we all have more than enough of it currently, and if you want to spend shelter in place truly enjoying the best listening experience of your LP's, you gotta take your equipment to Sheldon at Champlifier. The prices FULLY reflect the amazing care and detail that is taken on the service.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Horribly crooked & dishonest business. Please do not support this business , on top of the worst experience I had with Sheldon in his shop as a crooked human being the work he overcharged and was not truthful about his work that he performed was as equally disgusting!!
As you can see from the photo below the different color lights he tried to make me pay ,what was once a Beautiful receiver had multiple colors that was never asked to replace in the first place, this is what you get from Champlifier so take my word and just stay away!!!!
Please!!!</Text>

I stumbled upon this company through Yelp reviews and have found them to be an absolute gem.  My Kenwood multi-CD player, from 1995, stopped working just as the pandemic started and I have so missed music through great speakers.  Sheldon took the time to talk with me extensively on the phone and to diagnose the problem as a probable failed laser assembly.  He was very candid about expected cost and timing and I had told him I wanted to be able to use it for the holidays.  He promised to do some research and call me back in a few days, and HE DID!  He had found me a good deal on a similar Sony and I picked it up last night.  His Covid precautions are admirable and appreciated, and he also took the time to show me how it worked, to send me a PDF of the manual, and to tell me to contact him anytime if I had problems.  Customer service like he offers is rare and incredible to find!  I seldom write reviews, but this was more than a "10 out of 10" experience. I strongly recommend him and will definitely contact him for any further audio electronic issues.</text>

<Review>Sheldon Champlifier is an interesting study into quiet technical genius.
Years ago I brought in to his shop a girlfriends beloved Marantz receiver that was damaged in (UPS) shipping. I'm an old school audio guy and I've been around these tech's for decades. Sheldon has a first class shop and knowledge. Needless to say, the GF's Marantz was returned in immaculate condition and sounded better than it ever had before.
I recently had a problem with a Marantz 6100 turntable and Sheldon politely explained it was operator error. lol (He could have easily duped me out of $$ but, he didn't.). I was surprised to hear that Sheldon occasionally rehabilitates gear and sells it. He sold me an absolutely gorgeous Marantz 2252b Receiver to match my turntable. Did I get the best deal ever? No! I was happy no, I was thrilled to pay top dollar for a "Sheldon Chamlifier", completely rebuilt, better than new, and stunningly beautiful receiver. Not kidding, I cry every time (for the last two weeks) I turn it on and listen to it. sniffle... "The bitterness of poor quality remains long after the sweetness of low price is forgotten" Author Unknown
Sheldon is the only tech I trust with my gear from now on. Period!</Review>< pictures>

<text>Sheldon took four months to finally get to my unit and two more months to supposedly fix the channel that was not functioning consistently.   I also agreed to have him refurbish the unit, changing out a few LEDs.  It looked good and was very expensive, but the main problem I bought the unit in to get fixed was not working properly.  I took the unit back to him three months later and he took another four months trying to figure out what the problem was.  I finally said I wanted my unit back.  And one of the channels is NOT working properly.  His web site states the following: "Timely and efficient service" - well, it was NOT timely and efficient and the original problem was not fixed.  I realize that vintage repair can be expensive, but $1,500.00!!! I would NOT recommend going to this place.  I took my stereo to another place, they fixed the problem and only charged me $250.00.  Go figure. I see that some customers gave him great reviews, but not me, as I would give him an "F".  Sheldon does NOT have the depth of knowledge and he will inflate his fees.  Not ethical.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x808f80c57047c039:0x13a0b3652aadac6b</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Fantastic service! Thanks for bringing my pioneer sx9000 back to life.  Don't hesitate to bring your electronics to champlifier, defenetly worth the drive.</Text>

<Text>I brought my Pioneer SX-880 in for service and was quite happy with the experience. Sheldon fixed my phono amp issue in the right channel as well as a few other issues that the unit was having. Also had new ice blue LEDs put in, and boy does it look awesome.
Just a heads up if you havent been here....... They are very popular and this isnt like taking your car in to have an oil change. You will have to wait and it might take awhile. I had to wait a month before I could bring the unit in and then it was another 2 moths before I got it back. But the work that was done was great and I am quite happy with it.</Text><username>Gary Barnum</username><date>1558053012350</date><user_id>103975518124494635442< /user_id><gmapID>0x808f80c57047c039:0x13a0b3652aadac6b</gmapID>< Rate>

Hi-fi repair is in safe hands with the Champlifier.  Sheldon resurrected my 70s vintage Sansui receiver with all due attention to detail.  It wasn't cheap, but he did offer a basic option "A" repair and a more thorough option "B" refurbishment.  I took the basic fix and have no regrets.  You must be patient!  There are broken down components stacked to the ceiling in here.  Sheldon's wife helps traffic control, but sadly he has no apprentice in the workshop.  However, his technical wizardry validates the long wait for service.<//review>

<review>I can't say enough good things about Sheldon at Champlifier. I brought my Sansui 9090 amp into him over 2 years ago to have it refurbished. He did a great job at the time, and even worked up some custom speaker wires for me. But this review is also about the customer service that I received over 2 years later.

Recently, I moved across town and let the movers handle the amp. When I got into my new place and hooked it up, I couldn't get a signal. Fearing the worst, I emailed Sheldon to ask him how soon I could bring the amp back in for service. He called me immediately after I sent the email and offered to troubleshoot the issue with me over the phone. Within 5 minutes he had the amp working again at no cost to me. That is some true customer service!</review><Rate>5< /Rate>< UserId.>

Spoke with Sheldon about a broken AV Receiver. Described the problem and Sheldon instantly new what the issue was, and told me it was going to cost more to buy a new one than do the repair. They don't even sell, so he chose honesty over business! Awesome guy, highly recommend them!<//review>

<gmapID>0x808f80c57047c039:0x13a0b3652aadac6b<//gmapID><review>An honest, reliable, and straightforward technician or repair person who takes pride in their work is someone who is worth more than their weight in gold. Having Sheldon, his family, and his team here in Alameda is a blessing.

I had an old Sony receiver for years that I fell in love with. When it started acting up I looked online for potential places to bring it into for repair. When I spoke to Sheldon on the phone I knew he was the right person to bring my gear to because he said exactly what I was thinking; finding a fully functioning replacement unit online would potentially cost more time and money in the long run. Given the problem I was having, Sheldon said the unit was still worth looking at. In college I owned a 2001 Ford Taurus with 200,000 miles on it; I knew exactly where he was coming from. :)

It ended up being the case that the repairs needed would be more than the unit was worth. Sheldon had units in stock that he thought would be suitable replacements and gave me a great deal on a replacement unit which besides being an upgrade, had many features I always wanted to have for my setup. :)

I'm very happy with the outcome and Champlifier's service. I can't stress enough how valuable and rare it is to find someone who provides excellent service, and knowledge, in this or any industry.< /review></record>

Champlifier is beyond a doubt, no questions asked, far and beyond the best place to get your audio/ video/ electronic equipment repaired. They are quick (within reason), skilled, and so very easy to communicate with. Their team is upfront, honest, and truly cares about the services that they provide. 10000/10 will return to them for any future needs!<//text>

<Review>Brought in my Mac 6500 for repair and was immediately impressed with the  the efficient, friendly and  thoroughness doing the initial paperwork. As I was hoping for a rush repair, I was pleasantly surprised by the reduced repair time. Well worth the extra cost.  Sheldon and small staff were above and beyond my expectation with explanations, testing in my presence, as well as doing the loading into my car. This is the best service with the nicest people I've experienced in many years in any business.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>Repair services are expensive in the Bay Area, so it's a real pleasure when you come across a person who provides service that impresses you. Sheldon repaired and retuned my 45 year old McIntosh receiver. Yes, it cost more to repair than it would to buy a modern unit but a fourth of what it would cost to buy another McIntosh. The unit sounds as good as new, so I dug out some of my favorite 70's albums (remember those Telarc Hi Fidelity albums?) and played them again. I had forgotten how well the McIntosh played those albums. Sheldon was careful, clear and told me exactly what to expect. His work is superb. Fortunately, I can count on a few more decades from this receiver ...<//Text>< Gmap_id>

This place is incredible.  Small, hidden electronics repair shop with a brilliant engineer who can probably fix anything no matter how old but will also help you decide if it is worth it.  They know their stuff.  Repaired a set of speakers for me that I thought might be lost.  Definitely call them!!!<//Text>

Great service. He is very busy, so be prepared to wait a few weeks before you can come in for an appointment, and a few weeks for the system to be fixed. But they completely live up to the timelines they give you. They deliver. Highly recommended.< /text>

<gmapID>0x808f80c57047c039:0x13a0b3652aadac6b</gmapID><text>Champlifier tuned up my beloved Technics SL1210-Mk2 TT.  Nice work, good turnaround, fun to talk to about hi-fi.  Although not cheap, it's just like taking one's car to a mechanic, it is quality, precision work on a very rare and top of the line turntable, so I pay what I must to preserve it.  I will going in with a couple of my vintage receivers.

Champlifier is a great asset for folks like me who like good audio gear.  Some may call us audiophiles and that's fine, but there is quite a broad cost/value range when it comes to audio gear, and this is where Sheldon, owner of Champlifier, is so helpful.

He is qualified to work on the really, really expensive stuff, AND he is also qualified and willing to work on the good gear that mere mortals, like me, can afford.  Sheldon is an honest guy, and this matters immensely, because he will let the customer know that a particular repair might not be the most cost-effective solution, that it might be better to get something new, rather than waste time and money on a unit -- even when that is lost business for him.

Sheldon is also a good guide for which units are worthy used ones to look up and which combinations separates and brands make good systems.  I'm old enough to remember going in to real stereo shops and talking with salespeople who knew this same hi-fi secret sauce, but that knowledge has been lost until now.  Highly recommended.

The COVID crisis has really complicated things, so Champlifier/Sheldon is tending to really concentrate his work into longer work days, and then spending fewer days actually in the shop, so even though you may struggle to reach them, keep at it, they are in fact open and working, but just not the usual M-F 8-5 schedule.</text><UserId.>103946871170110600642< /UserId.></record>

Sheldon was extremely knowledgeable, helpful and friendly. He was honest with me that my receiver was probably not worth repairing. He did not try to "sell" me on a new receiver, but showed me a few he happened to have, spent multiple hours showing the receivers to me and letting me listen, and got me all set up! My new (old) receiver is awesome! Sheldon is clearly a man of integrity and is passionate about classic audio equipment, and the Bay Area is lucky to have such a rare resource.</review>

What else can I say about the team at Champlifier other than they are an amazing, friendly and passionate group who will do anything to repair or maintain your audio equipment. Sheldon, the spearhead who helped restore to working conditions my Braun Atelier set was incredibly kind, knowledgeable and is such a hard worker. Known for being an overachiever, working way past the conventional hours to troubleshoot and tactically repair equipment proved to me that he is the go to guy for audio repair in the Bay Area. I will definitely recommend Champlifier to anyone who is looking to repair their equipment!!! If I could give them more than 5 stars I would. Everyone on this team left a lasting, positive impression on me.<//review>

Sheldon is a master technician.  My over 30 years old NAD amplifier with THX technology suffered left and right channels burn out.  Sheldon was able to bring my NAD back to its former glory and it sounds like new!

I will now enjoy another 30 years of audiophile quality listening.  I could have bought a new amplifier but there would be a significant increase in cost to replace what I have—the repair was well worth the cost.

At Champlifier, I experienced great customer care—they were seriously attentive walking me through all the various steps that ultimately brought my amplifier to its original state with photos and using language I could understand.

Sheldon's technical expertise is phenomenal and professionalism tops.  I love the electronics laboratory environment which quietly says serious work on board.

I highly recommend Champlifier Audio Services.</Review>

Professional integrity, professional pride, excellent service, and exceptional workmanship are where I would start in describing my experience with Sheldon at Champlifier.  If you are going to entrust your electronics to anyone in the Bay Area, do yourself a favor and take them to Champlifier.  Not only will you get the best possible service at a very competitive cost, but you will have peace of mind.  Peace of mind that your equipment will be taken care of by the best.  Peace of mind that you can trust your technician.  Peace of mind that your needs are taken into consideration when decisions about the repair need to be made.  Peace of mind that if the extra mile is there, Sheldon will go there for you.  In the world of service, it is a rare commodity to find someone who does all this, and acts in your best interest.  With Champlifier you not only have a repairman, you have a consultant and advisor with the utmost integrity and professionalism.  Sheldon has more than earned my business, and as an audio enthusiast, my experience is that a reliable and trusted tech is a rare find.  Consider your gear lucky to get a place on his bench.</Review>

I love my Creek 5350 SE Amp and had it for 8 years when it needed repair recently.  Being a woman, I usually get anxious that I would be treated as if I did not know anything about electronics.  Finding Sheldon and Champlifier was a blessing for me.  He  is a total professional and a great guy who earned my respect and admiration.  He accommodated my time and knowing how much I love listening to music everyday, was able to get the amp back to me in a short time.  All in all, one of the best experiences.  The amp sounds amazing after the tune up and adjustments!!< /Review>

I have a 45 year old McIntosh amp which I brought into Champlifier. I could not be happier with the end result. One channel was out and the poor unit had lived in Hawaii for 25 years, which is a very unkind place for electronics. Not only did Sheldon expertly restore it to working order, he went above and beyond to do so. He even buffed up the wood case.
Unfortunately, I foolishly shorted out the darn thing when I got it home. After Sheldon patiently trouble shot the problem over the phone, i took it back in. Fuses were replaced and I learned more proper care and safety so that this would not happen again. I ended up purchasing his individually made speaker wire hook ups which are perfect for my amp and speakers. Having had the piece so many years, I thought I knew what I was doing. Lessons learned.
Sheldon is an expert. He is meticulous and is a very good teacher, patient and never condescending.
Be prepared to leave your property a good while so that he may do it right. Trust me. It’s definitely worth it.< /review>

This is a one-of-a-kind, impressive small business!! I called all over looking for speaker repair and was turned down from every electronics repair shop in the city, till I found Champlifier. Sheldon not only welcomed my busted speaker, but he was also courteous, professional, fast and reasonably priced. He called more than once to update me on the process of the repair and on any changes in the estimated cost, which I greatly appreciated. I highly recommend Champlifier for any and all audio repair.</Text>

I have a Yamaha P2200 stereo power amplifier from 1976 that needed a bit of work.  I first took it to my previous repair guy over in Walnut Creek, but after he kept it for a month, he called me and said that he didn’t know how to fix it.  When I picked the amplifier up, I found out that he had even removed some pieces, and had not put them back (but at least he gave them to me in a little bag lol).

After having several people recommend Sheldon at Champlifier, I decided to take my amp there.  I brought him my P2200, as well as the bag of parts from the previous tech.  He was optimistic about being able to fix it.  He estimated 3 weeks for the repair.  3 weeks later, like clockwork, he called me saying that it was done.  I was amazed that he was not only able to fix the original issues that the amp had, but also the mess that my previous tech caused, and get it all done perfectly on-time.

Since bringing the amplifier home, I have stressed it considerably, and really pushed it to its limits.  It has worked flawlessly, and performed far above my expectations.

I am very happy that I’ve finally found a tech that I can feel confident bringing my gear to, someone who I know is honest and who has the knowledge necessary to actually get the gear fixed correctly!</Text>

Sheldon has repaired 3 of my receivers with one more coming soon. He is both a technician and an artist when it comes to restoring these old electronics. There are no surprises, he carefully walks you through all of the options and pros/cons of any repair. And he makes sure that you understand the costs - total transparency! You need to be patient - this is not like dropping off your dry cleaning and his work is in high demand. Sheldon's primary inspection of each unit sometimes uncovers additional complications and each unit almost always needs individual attention. You can trust, however, that when the work is done it will be done RIGHT!<//Text>

<Text>Just had a fairly rare JBL SA 660 restored at Champlifier.   They do a wonderful job on the restoration and added did some wonderful modifications to update my amplifier.   After restoration,  they carefully went over what had been done and took there time demonstrating the rebuilt unit.   I would highly recommend them to anyone who needs their stereo components fixed or restored.   They care about the work that they do  and love stereos.</Text>< pictures>

Sheldon repaired my Cambridge Audio amp and PS Audio Power Conditioner. In fact, he not only repaired them but upgraded the caps and tweaked the conditioner so it would run cooler.

Sheldon takes great pride in his work. If you have vintage or new gear that needs repair, Sheldon will bring it back to life. Deal with confidence!< /Review>

Sheldon is The Bomb. I was extremely frustrated with my chaotic audio/visual/media situation and he came to my rescue. He assessed my current set up and listened closely to my goals and budget for making things better. He made several home visits on rather short notice to set things up and troubleshoot, and provided me with reconditioned amps, turntable, and speakers to meet my current needs, and these components are now working wonderfully. We also chatted while he was setting everything up and I'm impressed by his thoughtful, hard-working, and humane approach to business and life generally. I highly recommend him if you need help making your A/V system one that you can use and truly enjoy, rather than stress about. 5 Stars!</Text>

...flawlessly excellent, precise, "tasty" soldering for replacement of a dc power adapter component on a multi-effect guitar pedal pcb board; while I momentarily waited in the early evening. I wouldn't have had the time to grab a burger at the in-and-out down the street before it was back in my hands. And at a very fair price. It's hard to find all three points at the same time and place. If this is not 5 stars, I don't know what is. I almost wished I had more broken stuff to have them repair.
Oh, and the pedal board is back to the wonderful original condition of being able to switch between direct or battery power. Perfect.Thank you.< /Text>

I had a Crest 10004 amp which underwent severe damage from the shipping company, I took it over to Sheldon for repairs and he had it back up and running ready to put in some work.  His attention to detail comes second to none, and I highly recommend him to anyone looking for audio servicing needs.  Sheldon is now my go to guy for my audio equipment servicing.

<review>Made my MacIntosh 4100 sound like brand new, after I had given up on it three years ago. Totally awesome sound by a totally awesome guy. Sheldon loves old equipment. He was given a multimeter by his mother when he was twelve, and has never looked back. His talent and cost beats anyone in the bay area, maybe even No. Ca.< /review>< Pictures>

I want to repeat my recommendation for Sheldon's work.  He is friendly, straight-forward, knowledgeable, efficient, and good at what he does.  What's more, he has a real love for music and it comes through with how seriously he takes making it sound excellent.  He did excellent work on my stereo speakers as well as my Gibson amplifier.<//Text>

<text>I brought Sheldon my old school Hafler DH 500. He did great work quickly and like he said in his estimate he did his best to keep the cost down for me. Based on some of the other really high end audiophile gear he was working on in the shop I knew my old amp was going to be in good hands.

He was easy to talk to, understanding of my needs, trustworthy and after talking to him for 5 minutes I felt confident I had gone to the right place. Sheldon and Champlifier are well worth your time and money.< /text>< pics>

<Text>Super stoked about my experience with Champlifier. Quick diagnosis of what was going on with my receiver/amplifier, he had all the parts necessary on hand, and I got it back faster than expected. On top of that, it ended up costing less than estimated, and Sheldon was happy to answer all my audio nerd questions and offer suggestions. Thanks again, Sheldon!< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Sheldon is very knowledgable and professional. He replaced the wires in my record player for a very reasonable price, and he was able to do the job in less than 72 hours. If you are having problems with any of your audio equipment, I highly recommend taking it to Champlifier.< /Text>

I am extremely pleased with the level of service provided by Sheldon at Champlifier. I have used his services on two occasions: once to repair my Harman Kardon A/V surround receiver, and a second time to service and recap a vintage Pioneer receiver. Sheldon provided detailed explanations of the components he serviced and changed, and I was impressed by his technical knowledge and expertise. I highly recommend his service for all your audio needs.</text>

Champlifier Audio Services' Sheldon repaired my Eagle 7A amplifier and Linn Sondek turntable and I would give him the highest possible recommendation.  Sheldon is thoroughly knowledgeable and passionate about stereo/audiophile equipment.  If any of my stereo equipment needed repair, Sheldon would be my first choice without hesitation.</text>

One of the delicate wires going to my turntable's cartridge was torn, and Sheldon did a wonderfully neat and clean job mending it! He was very kind and told me that, for my case, where most work requires a few weeks, he was willing to get it done by the next day! In fact, he had it done by that evening! Very satisfied.< /Review>

<review>The wait time was pretty long. I waited several weeks without any update. The hours are about as inconvenient as a business can have. It's appointment only. I don't really get that. A repair shop seems like a retail type business to me. I definitely didn't get the cheap fix I was hoping for. I gave him the go ahead on an expensive repair. I already had some sunk costs with the deposit. When I picked up my speaker, it wasn't even my speaker, he just bought a brand new one. The money I gave him for one speaker was more than I paid originally for the whole set. The new speaker was damaged, he damaged it.  I could have just bought a new speaker myself and saved a lot of money and time.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

This is really a great place, Sheldon is really professional and helpful! He almost works exclusively on audio electronics but in my case made an exception. I was brought a Dell monitor that was dead and the guy who brought it to me really needed it fixed right away. I opened it up and saw the 3 blown capacitors that usually go out on Dell Flat panel monitors. I tried to find some at radio shack and a few other places without much luck. I then found Champlifier and gave him a call. Sheldon answered and right away was able to help me, he told me to come over to pick them up. When I got there he was courteous and professional and after talking to him for a few minutes he offered to remove the old ones and solder in the new caps at no charge! WOW! you don't find that very often, in just a few minutes he was done and my monitor was working like new again. 5 Stars to Sheldon and Champlifier, if I ever need any work done on my audio equipment I know where to go.< /Text>

Sheldon was great. With the Snell Audio now out of business I had no where to turn to get my sub-woofer repaired. Luckily I found out about Sheldon's business from speaker repair shop in Berkeley. I brought to him and a week later it was fixed - good as new, even better. Great job Sheldon!< /Text>

Sheldon and his staff recently repaired and reconditioned my vintage Pioneer SX-580 receiver. It had developed a distorted sound which they quickly diagnosed and repaired by replacing several capacitors, a faulty transistor, as well as repairing some solder joints and cleaning the controls and switches. It now sounds perfect...back to its glory days. They were a complete pleasure to work with and the cost was reasonable. Highest recommendation!</Review>

Sheldon is awesome!! I took my Sony STR‑DH750 7.2 Channel AV Receiver  to get it fixed around 9am one day and he fixed it the same day and I collected the device later that evening. One of the knobs on the back had tripped out and the amplifier basically stopped working. I couldn't be happier with the service and outcome since. The device works great now. I highly recommend this guy and will certainly rely on his services for any of my electronics needs.</Text>

I took a working but kind of tired 40something year old Sansui receiver to them and was told it would take up to 8 weeks for a report on what it needed. But Sheldon promised it would really sing, so i gathered all my patience and waited. It was well worth the wait. The crew at Champlifier took the time to explain exactly what was wrong, what was right, and offered several levels of repair according to my budget. I opted for a pretty substantial rebuild but shy of a complete restoration. They also provided a list of “would be nice to have” upgrades and I chose the led lighting and it is beautiful.The old Sansui is not only gorgeous but it really SINGS! The old Marantz turn table also got a tuneup and paired with the Sansui it’s like I’m discovering my favorite music all over again. Well done Champlifier!!! Just a note to emphasize what solid folks these are, the day I went to pick up my goodies Sheldon was obviously busy but stopped working and answered my dozens of questions about everything hi-fi with extreme patience and endless knowledge, demonstrated my new system for me and let me pick records to play and even helped me carry it all to my car. It’s obvious these people love what they do. Bring your stuff to them, be patient, and let them work their magic.< /text>

I had an old Crosley Stackamatic that wasn’t functioning properly. I called Champlifier to see if they could fix vintage turntables. I was so surprised and pleased when they called me to discuss my options. He put a lot of time going over the problem, explaining what steps it would require and costs involved. When I determined the cost would not justify fixing it, he went on to make suggestions of other turntables similar to mine but readily available and low in cost. They don’t sell the equipment so all his research was strictly for my benefit. I’m so thankful for all his time and concern in trying to resolve my problem. I wish all vendors were like Champlifier!</text>

<date>1443649580830</date><text>I brought Sheldon my Creek 4240 integrated amplifier, Harman/Kardon TU930 tuner, Sony tape deck (yes I said tape deck) and Sony CD player which were ALL having one problem or another.  He expertly diagnosed each piece and let me know which could be repaired and which could not.  He spent the most time on my Creek amp having discovered an overheating problem when he opened it up.  My equipment now sounds great and works as it should.  The Sony CD player could not be fixed as the parts are no longer available.  Sheldon sold me another CD player he had in the house so I went home with a piece of equipment I could use immediately.  Sheldon is competent and personable.  I highly recommend his services to casual and serious audiophiles combined.</text></record></dataset><record>

These guy's rock.  Very professional, fast, and willing to take the time to talk to you about your equipment.

Sheldon worked on my Adcom 5802 and when he was done it was as good as new.

I give this operation the highest recommendation based on the quality of their work and the knowledge of the staff.

<review>Sheldon refurbished our 1970's Sanyo stereo equipment beautifully.  We didn't know what we were missing until he restored the sound quality to its original depth and brilliance.  He is passionate about his work and about educating the consumer.  His prices were reasonable and he gave clear choices about the scope of the work.  The repair was much more rapid than we expected and he was creative in finding originals for the parts needed.  In spite of a busy schedule, he will take the time to explain, test and demonstrate.  He even showed us how to link our pre-computer equipment to modern streaming services.  He is a gem.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

I am super impressed with the speediness and great customer service overall provided by Sheldon at Champlifier.  I had a portable 3-speed record player with a bad cartridge that I was dying to play for my NYE party, only problem was I didn't find Champlifier until two days before the event.  Since he didn't want to make any promises he couldn't keep, he told me he would try, but normal wait time was 2 weeks out.  Low and behold, at 6pm two days later, he called to tell me my record player was in working condition and ready to get picked up.  Just in time for the party!

The man knows his stuff and delivers solid results.  I will definitely come back for any other audio problems I encounter.<//review>

I did not want to give up on my Audiolab 8000A integrated amplifier when it developed an intolerably loud hum. I found Champlifier rather randomly through a web search. Sheldon analyzed the problem and was initially able to fix it. When I took the unit home, it worked for a week and then failed completely. Sheldon then created a new work-around for the overheating problem that is virtually built in to the amplifier (very poor venting in the original design). Now the unit works perfectly and sounds as good as new. I did pay a pretty penny for both visits and fixes, but it was less than I would have paid for a new integrated amp with the same virtues. I also have a Classe integrated amp that I use for critical listening through my Martin Logan speakers, which needs attention for the failure of its right channel, and I'll be taking it to Champlifier for Sheldon's attention, with full confidence that he'll be able to address the problem for far less than it would cost me for a new, comparable unit, and that's the bottom line. He's  not cheap, but he knows what he's doing and communicates a certain trustworthy confidence.<//Review>

<Review>Champlifier Audio Services offers highly professional audio component repairs and services with a smile and lots of free expert advice--and all at very reasonable prices. Sheldon had me convinced of his exemplary competence and credibility in just a few minutes, and everything he has done since our first encounter has confirmed this.

Our 1989-vintage stereo system (speaker cables, CD player, and tuner-amp) needed maintenance and repairs to restore its full capabilities. All of them are now fully functional for far less than the cost of one replacement component of comparable quality.

On my latest visit--to pick up our repaired tuner--I met one of Champlifier's commercial customers, who works for a chain of local Bay Area movie theaters. He had just driven two hours to pick up the huge (1300-2000 watt) amps Sheldon had repaired for their theaters. (These are amps that are far more expensive and complex than anything I would buy, of course.) I like that kind of "endorsement."< /Review><Resp>None<//Resp><Name>Jon Spangler<//Name>< gmap_id>

Sheldon who was less than 100% health wise due to a neck injury he had gotten the evening before  still came to the shop to receive my broken amplifier. He was very knowledgeable and professional through the pain and received my amp. I was thinking that i wouldn't get it back for awhile. Much to my surprise he contacted me the next day with the initial findings and seeking information on how to proceed. He fixed the amp and returned it in less than a week which was a lot faster than I expected. I wholeheartedly recommend Champlifier to any and everyone who has gear that they need repaired.<//review>< GmapID>

If you have older vintage stereo equipment in need of repair or restoration, do not hesitate to bring it to Champlifer Audio Services. The owner, Sheldon, has rebuilt the crossovers on a pair of Infinity QB speakers from the late 70's, and they sound just like new. I also brought a 1977 Luxman L-80V integrated amplifier to Champlifier for a thorough testing, cleaning, and refurbish in order to bring it to it's former glory, and Sheldon did a great job. When I brought it in, he opened it up and explained to me what needed to be done, the replacement of capacitors, the cleaning of switches, etc.. He takes the time so that you can understand the process. He has great customer service skills and, most importantly, he knows his way around high end audio components. He also knows how these units are supposed to sound. In my opinion he charges a fair price for a professional hour considering his level of education and talent.< /review>

I found Champlifier while living in Berkeley and have come to Sheldon with two custom jobs.

First was a Stax amp bias modification.  Rather than turn down an unfamiliar topics, Sheldon did extra extra legwork to make sure he could deliver top quality result.  Everything turned out great.

Second project involved customizing a car EQ so that the volume knobs could be mounted with the unit hidden.  It took over a year of emails back and forth but Sheldon stuck with me through it all.  Could not be happier with the results!

Sheldon is a great guy and provides amazing service.  I am now in the South Bay but making the trip to Alameda is an easy decision.</Text>

Sheldon at Champlifier is a star.   He repaired a Mackie 450 speaker for me in a short turn around.  Later, when it stopped working, i brought it back because it also needed a new soundboard.  Not only did he not charge me for the service portion of the soundboard installation, but he turned it around same day because i was having a party that night!  Bring him your business, you won't be disappointed.< /review>

<Text>I've been waiting for Sheldon to repair my audio equipment.

Years.  No kidding.

Here's what was delivered to my new friend recently - based only on his Yelp reviews - and have been enjoying ever since they were delivered back to me:

Marantz 2245 - LED lamp upgrade and service. It's so legit now.

Yamaha CR 820 - LED lamp upgrade.

Marantz 6100 - Sheldon upgraded my cartridge because he accidentally damaged the needle on the cart that was on the table when I brought it to him.  New belt and RCA outs.  YEP - legit.

JVC Sea 80 - Service and was honest with a portion of the repair that wasn't worth my time.

Why did I wait years to repair this equipment? Because I was waiting for Sheldon.  Have you read the other electronic repair services' Yelp reviews? Anything less than 5 stars isn't worth it.

Sheldon is a rarity in the electronics repair world and I'm glad he is in business.

Bring in your equipment, give him the space and the time to work on your treasured items, and be prepared to be amazed by customer service and repair expertise that you thought wasn't available.

It is.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x808f80c57047c039:0x13a0b3652aadac6b<//Gmap_id></record>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Sheldon is terrific.  I was referred here by a local music shop limited in repair ability. He took a look at my 7-channel mixer within two days of me dropping it off.  A few days later he called me with a diagnostic and suggestions.  A few days later I had my fixed mixer back. The next day he was calling to ask about how it was performing!

I really appreciate how Sheldon explains everything in a clear, patient, straightforward way. He's talented and passionate about electronics and is a pleasure to be around in general. He even fixed two janky speaker inputs for free. He's really organized and available too. You can call or text him pretty much anytime. He e-mailed me to let me know work had started on my mixer, and then after it was done, he e-mailed me a copy of the invoice.

As far as price, it's reasonable. Yes, I could have purchased another cheap mixer for the cost of the fix, but that's just the thing.  It would be cheap, with another worthless fan, and bound to break somehow in a year or two. Not a lot of people work on this kind of stuff, especially for Sheldon's rates, and they certainly don't have fast turn arounds.  Peace of mind is priceless.  Now I know I can haul all my gear anywhere and it'll work like a *champ.* Yeah, really glad I found this place. I'll be back whenever I have a problem with any of my gear.<//review>< pics>

He treats each piece of equipment with respect for it's potential, then seems to enjoy doing everything he can to bring  it up to that potential.    He certainly got my old Adcom to sing sweetly.  With upgraded capacitors and other repairs and calibrations, I believe it's sounding better than I've ever heard it.

FYI - In the shop, along with my old Adcom 555II, where pieces by Krell and Mark Levinson along with a mix of everything from PA gear , an electric Piano, and an old 'Flame Linear' power amp.

He's also a lovely person to deal with. - What more could you want?</Review>< Pics>

<rate>5< /rate><text>I had purchased a high quality amplifier in around 1974 , an Epicure Model One,and it served me well for 20 + years until a PGE power surge fried the outputs and it has sat for almost another 20 years. I finally decided to have it repaired and found Sheldon from a craigslist listing. I brought it to him along with the schematic and even though he had never seen or even heard of one before he assured me he could repair it. I left it with him and about two weeks later it was repaired-all 8 output transisters had been replaced and various other small parts .It was not cheap to repair but the quality of the work was well worth the cost.  After listening to it again it seems to sound even better than before and  I would highly recomend Sheldon to anyone with vintage audio to be repaired .<//text>< pictures>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>This really is interesting to see all these 5 star reviews on this business.. Because my experience was quite different ..  While the work was good (its not a terribly difficult job)   the cost of repair , without question in my mind ,  is exorbitant to put it nicely. I thought I would give this business a chance.   About 8 mos ago there was a bit of a red flag regarding the owner not responding to an inquiry I had. I did not heed that gut feeling to go somewhere else.    Due to a number of shops that had recommended I thought I would bring a tuner in that simply had 2 bulbs burnt out and indicated to replace only the 2 bulbs.   And  this person  took it upon them self to replace a third which did not need replacing.     Normally I would do this myself and in fact had replaced a couple of bulbs in this tuner previously.  Mind you this is not rocket science.  The meter bulbs are accessible with the simple removal of 6 screws on the bottom cover plate.  Remove that cover and the bulbs are right there.  not hidden, not buried. right there .   So ok.   How long does it take to solder a couple of wires to a bulb and put the little assembly back into the slot?  I'm not a stranger to this type of work.  As I noted,  I've had this tuner apart including removal of the front face plate to replace dial bulbs.   A tech is literally looking at 20 minutes .. Ok.  so lets give an hour.    It's not difficult at all to get an idea of how long a simple job like this should take when I have done the same thing myself and  when one is familiar with working on cars,  electronics ,,etc..   I was charged $212 ..  That my friends is ,, by even bay area standards  is way above what constitutes a  fair price.  At least the job was done right-- at least so far.   But that can not justify how much it cost to replace a couple of bulbs  and a piece of wire  6 inches long maybe---(that was 10 bucks)   bulbs were $8 each x 3 = $24 for 3 sm meter bulbs!
3 bulbs and a piece of wire .    Let me give an analogy  and see if this resonates in terms of getting ones moneys worth.  Just so its clear that I dont have a problem spending the money.      I had a McIntosh vintage tuner completely gone through and restored by a Mac authorized tech who has been in the business for more than 30  years.  This was a complete restoration including any updates that the factory noted needed to be done.   that job was 500 and change.  A friend was quoted $180 for a complete alignment including tuning pot replacement from Magnum Dynalab. ( a very involved technical service requiring electronic test instruments and the skill to match)   In comparison   this shop would of charged me upwards of $1k to restore my Mac if he is going to charge $212 to replace 3 bulbs.
Do yourself a favor.  Try L&M electronics,  Daly City,   Genes Audio (house calls)   , even Handy TV repair on University in Berkeley.. He mostly works on tv's but does some audio as well.  And I see there appear to be a couple more places.  Erik in Alameda,  Bruce in Berkeley.  Whatever you do don't go here.
People need to know .    I am respecting Google though for keeping my review in the que.    Yelp kicked  my review to the not recommended reviews page along with 1 or 2 others.   The reason ---because I am not an active part of the Yelp community is what I am able to discern reading their FAQ.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x808f80c57047c039:0x13a0b3652aadac6b< /GmapID></record>

Champlifier is really the best audio technician service in the Bay Area. Sheldon, the owner, personally oversees or works on your equipment. Whether you have a boutique English solid state amplifier or a classic Marantz receiver, Sheldon will go above and beyond to acquire the schematics, parts, or accessories, whether from the manufacturer, third party parts dealers or even Ebay.

I brought Sheldon a number of items through the years, including two NAD receivers, a pair of Rogers LS6 (BBC spec) speakers, and QSC amplifiers. I tried taking the Rogers LS6 to a competing audio technician in North Oakland. Boy was that a mistake. That technician had no idea what a Rogers BBC spec speaker was all about. In fact, he tried to replace my woofer and cone with a Sony replacement. WTF?! So of course, I was fuming mad and disillusioned with technicians acting like they know their audio history and technology.

When I brought it to Sheldon, he knew right away what was wrong. He pointed out the dust cap, which was becoming unglued and causing a rattle sound. No cone or driver replacement necessary! Not only did he save me money, but gave me tips as to how to replace it myself with over the counter glue from Michael's.

My last item that I brought to Sheldon, a NAD 7100 amplifier, was just as exceptional. It had some issues with the logic board that I didn't know about. It kept cutting out on one channel, and the tuner was spotty. The tuner wouldn't turn on somedays. I finally got tired of the solid state amp and brought it in. Sheldon couldn't find the issue, as the amp decided to work when it was in Sheldon's possession for a week. He charged me the $35 inspection fee, and I brought it home. Lo and behold, the NAD 7100's tuner stopped working completely. Anyone who knows the NAD amp series knows the tuner is precise and crystal clear. So, I had to bring the NAD amp back to Sheldon. He set aside the $35 inspection fee and told me he would have it fixed in three weeks.

Three weeks later, Sheldon gave me a perfectly working NAD 7100 amplifier. He had hunted a broken NAD 7100 on Ebay. Taken out the broken logic board piece. Put in the logic board from the Ebay NAD 7100 and completely restored my NAD amplifier with 100% original parts. The final bill was less than $45. In one word, exceptional.

I trust Sheldon as an honest professional that will give you the best technical skills and personal service. I have been blown away by his work. (again my issues were mostly with solid state amps, which is hard to get fixed at typical musician repair shops) And I cannot recommend Sheldon enough to everyone I know.</review>

About two months ago I brought a vintage Kenwood Eleven GX to sheldon to repair the right channel that was intermittent.  There were also several lights on this old 70's stereo receiver.  Sheldon was friendly and professional.   I could tell when I walked into his shop that I was in the right place because his work area was neat and orderly.  Everything was organized and put in the proper place.  I also saw other vintage expensive gear on the shelves.   I could tell this was not his job, but he was passionate about what he does and takes care of every piece like it is his own.

Several day later he fixed my Receiver and it  sounds and looks great.   He also did an LED conversion on this unit that took him a while because of the age, but it looked like a piece of art when he was done.

Since then I have brought in my Yamaha M-2 amp (1978 vintage 240 watts a ch) to have the bulbs replaced and a a routine check up.    Was turned around in a short time and looks and sounds great.

I also brought Sheldon my Yamaha R-1000 receiver (Vintage 1982)  and he replaced several bulbs and capacitors.   It's like the day they were born, revived and ready to go for another 40 years.

I would recommend Champlifer to any friend or family member.

You rock Sheldon!< /Text>

I don't have much words to say except that I brought my Krell KSA-100 amp into Champlifier with a lot of doubt. My amp had a loud pop and smoke and smell were coming out of the amp. I didn't want to send the Krell to Krell Service because I know that they would charge a pretty huge sum of money plus they require you to have the original box.

Taking a chance on Sheldon from Champlfier, I left my amp there for about 3 weeks. Sheldon was very attentive and took time with customers. He called me up for quotes and give detailed explaination of what went wrong with the amp. Basically, a lot of the power transistors on one channel just went out. He had to do a replacement of all of the transistors on one channel. I still had doubt that the amp would sound the same with what he was doing. Mind you that this is a Class A amp. However, Sheldon proved me wrong. The amp, after repair, sounded perfect. Not only that all the power transistors that Sheldon replaced were perfect match with the original transistors. Sheldon also did a few re-cap of the capicitors for me that was too old. The cost was not cheap but reasonable.

He also detected a problem with the power switch for me and had it fixed for free. I keep telling Sheldon that we need more people like him and it's a blessing that I was able to find him and that he should be in the business of amp fixing and he should never quit. He bring joy to a lot of audiophiles.<//review>

Culture Cannabis Club does it again!  The quality of the people, decor, the flower, the selection, and the vibe is second to none.
And somehow this place has better prices than everyone around.<//review>

The service was amazing, patient and they'll work with you to stay within your budget.
They carried the inhaler with THC doses and other great products.  Flowers are in a range of strength and prices.
There is plenty of parking.
Pre-ordering is done through Weedmaps.<//review>< pics>

I know it can be difficult when you are on the go and don't have them readily available.\n\nWe also try to stay very competitive with our pricing and I can promise you that we will always beat every out-the-door price from any other dispensary in the area (if we are somehow not already beating their prices).\n\nIf you happen to be in the area again, please stop in and chat with us.  We would really love another chance to exceed your expectations!"}<//response>

She knows what she’s doing and that type of service in my opinion is worth every penny. GET IT DONE RIGHT THE FIRST TIME.

I came to Nancy's insurance to get both my cars and my husband's motorcycle insured. She got me insane low rates for full coverage! Her office responded almost instantly with the best options. Go to Nancy's every time you need a renewal, she'll save you serious money!< /Review>

I HIGHLY recommend Nancy’s Insurance and Registration Services. 6 years of being in the trucking industry I haven’t found an agency whose prices are good and has everything done ASAP.  She also gave me a payment plan to pay permits, license plate which is rare now a days, and the best of all she helped me open up a corporation. NANCY IS THE BEST AND I PLAN ON DOING BUSINESS WITH HER FOREVER.<//Text>

I hired this company to peform a job that they did not complete. They overcharge and claim they know what they're doing but they all they do is fill out a form. They also refuse to give you copies of the forms because they don't want the customer know how little they really do. In addition, they charge an exaggerated amount. I trully believe that this company targets small trucking companies that need help. Save your money and call the DMV yourself. They're more than happy to help you and you'll save hundreds of dollars.< /Review>

This insurance agency overcharges customers just for filing out paperwork. They are quick to charge their fees but slow and subpar at completing the work. They hide their unethical business practices with apparent niceties. One unethical business practice is their refusal to provide customers with copies. I'm suprised they have any positive reviews.</Text>

I can definitely see why they have such good reviews. This office was referred to me by a friend after a traumatic experience with my previous dentist. My first visit was for an emergency tooth extraction.

The dentist and hygienist who worked with me were professional, kind, understanding, and patient. The dentist sat down with me and told me about what my options were and told me what she thought we should do. She was tactful and calm with me, and did everything in her power to calm me down.

Honestly, I have enough dental anxiety that the only way I could be calm during a visit is if I'm sedated, and I didn't have enough time between my call and the visit to get the medication for that. The website says it is something they offer, and I'll have to ask.

They put on soothing ocean sounds, they were calm and cheered me on the whole way, they spoke to me encouragingly, laid things out easily, and were overall incredibly professional and kind through the whole experience.

I plan to call back and set up a plan to get the rest of my dental work done. I really love this office. The receptionists are on top of things and very thorough. I would recommend this office to everyone I speak to!</text>

1. Fear of dental procedures: After an episode where the anesthesia stopped working during my C-section, the thought of anesthesia began terrifying me. I have been going to Starbrite for a few years now but this was the first time I had to replace my crown and get anesthesia since my traumatic experience with the c-section. The staff was so kind, understanding and caring. They checked in with me constantly, and did everything they could to help me have a better experience. I was humbled by how much they truly cared about me and how I felt during the procedure. They ended up finding a work around so I didn't have to replace the crown yet, as this allowed me some more time to process my fear of anesthesia before I need to return and do the true procedure.

2. Children check ups: For routine check ups, we go as a family and everyone is very sweet with my 5 and 2 year olds. There is a TV on the ceiling that helps distract the kids, and they give them a little toy at the end. My 5 year old was very curious about her permanent teeth and the dentist went back into the system to show my 5 year old her teeth that had not cut through yet. My 2 year old keeps asking when we will go back to the dentist.

I really recommend them for any families with little ones and/or people with any sort of anxiety related to dentist visits.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>Last year I lost my molar due to impacted wisdom tooth and I preferred StarBrite Dental for the molar implant procedure. The whole process was meticulous, high quality, affordable and comfortable. I must appreciate Dr. Lokhandwala and her team for the seamless experience that I had for my dental implant. Based on my experience, I would certainly recommend recommend StarBrite Dental Fremont CA to friends and family.< /Review><Date>1599627202057<//Date><Gmap_id>0x808fbf7e8de89c8d:0xc0129b7ed607601c<//Gmap_id>< UserId.>

<Review>StarBrite's staff is friendly, efficient and professional. Dr. L is excellent as our her hygienists. I am thrilled to have them as my new dental service crew. As someone who is extremely nervous when it comes dental work, I couldn't have felt more cared for and "safe". I am so grateful to them.< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>The facility is always clean and tidy.  The staff is always welcoming.  In this new climate of social distancing, I appreciated the appointment updates via text or call, as well as the arrival process. I was especially thankful to receive schedule delay notifications, which shows how considerate they are of other’s time. Their added personal protective gear, despite how uncomfortable it may be to perform, displays the level of care and safety they have for involved parties. I appreciate their thoughtfulness for the staff, patients and family during this trying time!< /Text><time>1591671720930</time><Resp>{'time': 1582265775032, 'text': 'Thank you.

With my history of high anxiety and fear of being in the dental office, not mentioning having dental procedures, StarBrite Dental has always calmed my anxiousness without expected conscious sedation. I’m looking forward to continuing excellent dental care with Dr Lokhandwala & Dr Tariq @ the professional StarBrite Dental.<//text>

I am glad to have StarBright Dental taking care of my entire family. I really appreciate their quick response to emergency text message and providing care during this pandemic situation. Happy to be taken care always and moreover my kids love the doctors and staff there. The facility is clean, takes precautionary survey questions and survey from visitors, less crowded and sterilized equipments gave me confidence during my visit today.<//Text>

<review>I’ve been visiting StarBrite Dental for around a year and the experience has been very good. Dr. Lokhandwala is very good and has an awesome staff who make you feel comfortable. I had my wisdom tooth extracted last year and it was a breeze despite I having a bit of apprehension of how it will go...I would highly recommend to visit Starbrite if you’re looking for the best dental care for your teeth in Fremont, CA.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>I had veneers done on my 2 front teeth from another dentist 18 months prior. Not long after they were installed, my right-front veneer cracked and actually chipped away from the top of the tooth at the gums.

I was obviously reluctant to go back to the same dentist to have her fix the broken veneer. My wife saw StarBrite Dental in Fremont and found that they had good reviews. Let me tell you, I have not had great experiences with dentists ever since I broke my 2 front teeth at the age of 6. Dr. Lokhandwala and her staff were so courteous and friendly that I immediately felt comfortable.
I went into the appointment thinking they would take some x-rays, pictures, molds, etc. and they would schedule another appointment once my "fix" was ready. They actually fixed (permanently) the tooth right there, on the spot, with perfect color matching. This and some x-rays were all done in under an hour.
Overall, this was a fantastic experience. I highly recommend StarBrite Dental to anyone looking for an easy, comfortable (as can be) dental experience.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1591857801454, 'text': 'Thank you for reviewing us!

<Time>1607732836240< /Time><rate>5</rate><review>I'm always nervous about writing words like "stellar" and "super-duper" or "awesome" in these reviews because I'm afraid that there will be a swarm of new patients and then I won't be able to get another appointment for months and months.

But they deserve it.  Drs Lokhandwalla and Saeed went the extra mile when it came to my initial exams and kept my anxieties in check.  I'm especially terrified of dental work and they've been able to consistently put me at ease.  I've also been sedated for work here and honestly I couldn't hope for a better experience. The entire staff is extremely friendly, consciencious and considerate.  They take the time to listen-this is really important to me-and they acknowledge the issues and then apply this information to their work. I haven't experienced this anywhere else.

So if you're terrified or nervous or if it's been a while since you've visited a DDS, rest assured that at Starbrite you'll be handled by the best.</review>< pics>

I called looking for the same day appt for a tooth extraction and was seen with very short notice. Everyone who works there (especially the two female dentists)were nice and made me feel comfortable. The extraction was painless and quick.  Thank you for letting me come in on such short notice. I highly recommend  this dental office and will be back guaranteed. Thanks again!< /Review>

<rating>5</rating><Review>My mom recently moved from Hawaii and in the process of transferring her state medical and insurance cards. She was in pain and needed to see a dentist STAT. So mind you, she does not have any insurance on her at all. I’ve called a list of dental offices and their earliest to see her was Monday. To save their time and mine, I let them know that she’ll pass. When I called StarBrite, Ms Judy answered the phone, and like the other receptionists I’ve talked to before her, she was nice and kind. What the others didn’t have was sense of urgency. Ms Judy had sympathized with me and actually sounded she cared. She mentioned Saturdays are usually their cleaning days, but she’ll give me a call back to see if they can accommodate her the next day(which is a Saturday). I was going to call the next dental office but my phone rang. It was Ms. Judy. She had said that the doctor will see her the next day. I had mentioned that she doesn’t have any insurance, and she assured me that we will work something out. I was beyond happy!
Come the next day, the moment we stepped through the office doors, Ms Judy greeted and welcomed us asking if I was the emergency walk in. My mom, who was already nervous of the visit, was surprised of how friendly Ms Judy was and it made her feel like she’s in good hands. Walk in Ms Nurse(I have forgotten your name, my apologies) she took great care of my mom, that my mom felt relaxed. Enter Dr. Yen(?), my mom has felt that she is safe to put her oral care in his hands. With how they(2 nurses and Dr) were trying their best to make my moms HBP to come down. Unfortunately we weren’t able to complete what we were there to do due to her HBP, but the fact they went above and beyond for my mom,  we were happy to walk out satisfied. My mom has said to me that she will not go anywhere else for her teeth. They were willing to work something with you and the prices they give are affordable. So thank you StarBrite team for making us feel comfortable, relaxed and safe. Y’all rock!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Review>StarBrite Dental Fremont led by Dr. Munira and her team is highly capable and compassionate dental facility in CA. My son was in deep pain due to toothache and swelling in gums in May 2020, considering this an emergency situation StarBrite Dental treated him immediately. I am so impressed the way they did the procedure. I will highly recommend this place for dental treatment. It is hard to find trustworthy and experienced dentist and staff, StarBrite Dental Fremont has one of them.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

StarBrite provides the best dental service in the Bay Area.

Scheduling appointments is fast & simple.

But..., I gladly drive from Oakland to Fremont every time (twice a year)  because the care is reliably gentle & thorough.

They are simply superior.

I will never have to shop around for dental care.< /text>

Quick checkin, excellent service. Felt like I was talking to another human at a get together. We shared our experiences of east coast and by the time process started, I felt totally at ease (for the record, I’m not big fan of dentist visits). Today’s was one of the easiest and least painful cleaning visits in recent memory.

So, thanks< /Text>

<username>Keith Tawakuli<//username><Date>1593203662818< /Date><Rate>1<//Rate><text>This place is a complete joke and they canceled my teeth whitening right before my appointment.

So after reading the google reviews for this location,  I decided to make an appointment 3 weeks ago for today in the afternoon.

I filled out the new intake patient form and submitted it online and looked forward to seeing possibly good results for teeth whitening.

I got a text last Friday from their office saying I had failed to respond back to their prior attempts and my appt was canceled for Monday.

I called and demanded to know when they sent any type of communication.

They said they sent text messages that were not responded to. I demanded the date and time of said texts and I I asked for timestamps.

They responded that they could not give me the time stamp or days the texts were sent to me.

That was a giant red flag right there!!!

They rescinded their cancellation request and my appt was back on for Monday.

Today 2 hours before the appt they called to say they could not do the teeth whitening at all now or even later, but wanted me to come in for the invisalign consult.

I said absolutely not and hung up.

It is very clear they had no intention of doing the teeth whitening and were looking to make excuses to get out of it and lied from the start.

All they did was waste my time by booking me an appt they were never going to keep.

Avoid this hot mess.

Follow up 6/26/20
According to 3 different dentists in Fremont that I just called today 6/26/202, you are allowed to have patients come in for teeth whitening only. Maybe they are wrong and you are right, I am not sure.

What I am sure about is you made an appt for teeth whieneing 3 weeks ago, and according to what you stated that is not allowed.

Then you backhandedly tried to blame me for not responding to text messages you never sent.

And finally you canceled the day of hoping to still cash in on some invisalign work after some bait and switch.

Your office is shady!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1593161862853, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

This is my second visit and i had a very good feeling that i have found an excellent dentist.
The procedure i went through was to remove a tooth implant that was done (incorrectly) by another dentist. The implant surrounding was infected and there was bone loss. The dentist was very confident in what she was doing and took her time to remove the implant and insert the bone graft. She showed me pictures and explained what was done and why. She was gentle and  I would like to add that she has a very friendly staff to assist her.  I just came to this dentist for a second opinion and initial exam was through that i felt confident that i should let her take care of my immediate problem and so far I'm pleased with the process.< /text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><userid>108914282883565572115</userid><Text>I needed implant on my front tooth and given that I reached this state due to suboptimal of an earlier dentist, I was really worried about letting any dentist touch my tooth. So I stayed with a broken post for THREE years. Finally got enough courage (and did enough analysis of doctors around the area) to reach StarBrite.

I am so glad I did. A few bullet points:
(a) I never had to wait during my appt- big plus
(b) I was informed of the expenses from get go and there were no surprises
(c) Doctor and her staff were super nice and were always prepared by the time I got there. It made me feel welcome and respected.
(d) There was NO pain... let me say it again... no pain during any of the 4 sittings
(e) Doctor kept me informed me at all times, of the process, material used, actions taken that day, precautions I need to keep etc.
(f) Every time Dr. took pains to ensure that the took (temp as well as final) not only looked good, but also felt good in variety of manners.

Overall I am very happy with the experience. It took 9 months from start to finish but it all ended well.

Thanks Doctor.< /Text>< gmap_id>

Dr Lokhandwala is great with them and does not push unnecessary procedures (which, unfortunately, many dentists do). She is also knowledgeable and patiently answered all my umpteen questions when my kids were getting orthodontics treatment done at another place :) It's easy to book appointments at a convenient time.</Text>

Love It!! Great facility. Amazing staff. Very kind and knowledgeable doctors!
Always working in the best interest of the patient. I had visited over 4 times this year and I still love this place!
They explain everything very clearly and then let the me choose what and when i want to get it done.
Definitely recommend this place for the entire family.</Review>

<review>I arrived on time for appointment but there was no one at the receptionist desk, sat there, for a bit before some one passed by and attended to me. The Hygienist appeared to be new and was a little rough in polishing the teeth, but communicated well.

Dr. Shah was excellent as always.<//review><GmapID>0x808fbf7e8de89c8d:0xc0129b7ed607601c< /GmapID><date>1556111675507</date><rate>3<//rate></record></dataset><record>

They are highly knowledgeable in the procedures that they perform and they educate there patients well on said procedures. I went to have two dental implants placed (both being rear molars), and i can honestly say that i was comfortable the whole time as i experienced no pain during each procedure. I enjoyed every visit, the staff is friendly and attentive. Overall i highly recommend Starbrite dental.</Review>< Pics>

We have been coming to StarBrite for over ten years and would not go anywhere else.  Professional, state of the art office with painless, efficient billing.  Yesterday, the office was able to accommodate my son in an emergency with just a few minutes notice.  These dentists and office are the BEST!</text>

The dentist was very helpful and clearly explained all of my treatment options. She was kind and there was no pressure to choose the most expensive solution. She had state-of-the-art equipment and I felt confident that she would be able to resolve any of my dental problems. I already referred my daughter to the practice.<//Text>

<Review>A very professional doctor, humble and fair price!!! I had my front false teeth fallen and had trouble replacing it. I have no medical insurance and tried to call different clinics in Fremont to do x-ray, see a doctor and get my false tooth replaced. The estimate price I was given was expensive for me and almost gave up. After waiting few days, I called StarBrite dental and pleased with their hospitality, and their fair price. Starting from the reception, the cashiers and Dr. Munira  were very cooperative and polite. I had my false tooth replaced by Dr. Munira in a very short period of time and a price which I can afford. I am so pleased to see such professional doctors around and recommend others to visit them and get your dental issued in a friendly and professional manner!!!< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Always love coming here. My dentist is very straightforward, discusses all options of my treatment plan with me.Very sensitive and aware of my needs if I have discomfort. Going to the dentist is not always fun if you have to get work done, but the ladies here make it tolerable. Janis at the front desk is knowledgable and explains in detail about services done, what was paid and what was out of pocket so you can clearly understand the services you are paying for. This is the only dental office i will visit. Planning on taking my daughter and boyfriend here from now on!<//text>

The condition has progressed to a level of periodontal disease. I'm delighted to have an amazing professional expert dentist who takes care of the issue but also provides alternatives that supports healthy teeth & a good look. I'm looking forward to dental appointments. I cannot believe I'm saying this. It's true. I'm learning to take care of my mouth & restore healthy palate. Thx you, Doctor.
Pain management is outstanding! I didn't feel pain for an extraction! Dr. was certain to ensure that I didn't experience discomfort. My denture was inserted with ease until my implants are ready. I am thrilled to be a dental patient at StarBrite Dental! I love my dental family.

< Review>
I have written here before to give an excellent review but i want to add that I have added my younger daughter to the list of the happy.  They made her feel very comfortable and eased the experience for a 4-year-old to smiles and pride, because she went through the cleaning and exam without a problem.  I continue to receive the best of support, from Dr Munira to my best friend, Janet, who continues to answer the call on many of my unexpected but needed visits.  I wouldn't and won't go anywhere else.< /Review>

Always the best with the service. My cleaning always leaves me in best form for my teeth. Parking is a down side lately. Even on a weekday I have to find parking on the street vs in the back parking by the offices.</review>

A very professional doctor, humble and fair price!!! I had my front false teeth fallen and had trouble replacing it. I have no medical insurance and tried to call different clinics in Fremont to do x-ray, see a doctor and get my false tooth replaced. The estimate price I was given was expensive for me and almost gave up. After waiting few days, I called StarBrite dental and pleased with their hospitality, and their fair price. Starting from the reception, the cashiers and Dr. Munira  were very cooperative and polite. I had my false tooth replaced by Dr. Munira in a very short period of time and a price which I can afford. I am so pleased to see such professional doctors around and recommend others to visit them and get your dental issued in a friendly and professional manner!!!< /text>

<text>I like that my appointments are taken care of promptly. Dr Munira also gives me some honest choices rather than whats more profitable to her practice. It's refreshing to have someone offer necessary choices rather than taking you to the cleaners like so many other dentists do. And the staff is always courteous and friendly. Thanks, Starbrite.<//text>< Pics>

< Review>
I am happy with my decision to use StarBrite Dental for the extensive dental work I need done. Very skilled, professional and courteous staff in front and back. The dentist and assistants are very accommodating and very careful not to cause pain when giving injections or any other procedure. I had a bad experience with a big chain dental clinic a couple of years back which was very disheartening but since going to StarBrite I have renewed hope for my dental problems. They are doing it the right way this time and had I chosen them the first time I would be done by now. They're great< /Review>

Dr Munira's Dental Office takes care of their patients of everything a patient would expect.

Their professionalism in rendering the service is EXCELLENT. This is the most assuring thing that makes me visiting their practice again and again.

I am impressed with the state of the art equipments, that makes dental x-ray so easy.<//Review>

Excellent experience at StarBrite not only with Dr Munira but all other Doctors and assistants. They understand your needs and limitation well and adjust to your needs and requirement on one side which keep you in perfect health on the other side.

Although it is far from my place and need extra effort to reach there, still I visit them.

<Review>The whole team is outstanding. I have been going there for the past 14 months. I had several procedures done over the span of those 14 months ranging from cleaning to bone grafting, tooth extraction and implants. During all those visits, I found the whole team very compassionate. Their goal was to make me feel better. I strongly believe that it is not just one person who makes the experience good or bad, it is always the teams that can make it happen. And Dr. Munira's team certainly made me feel extremely comfortable. They were very flexible towards adjusting appointments, extremely personable, very passionate and knowledgeable about their work. All the doctors were not only good doctors but very good teachers as well. They explained the whole process in a detailed manner with pros and cons. They made an otherwise expensive process very affordable. All in all, my experience was fantastic. They gave me my smile back; the least they deserve is appreciation and due credit. I strongly recommend this place.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I am a very satisfied patient at Star Brite Dental.  Yesterday, I felt a wiggle in a front tooth with a root canal and jacket.  I called today to see if I could come in within the next few days, forgetting it would be the Labor Day weekend. Although I had no pain and was able to eat just fine,  they made time for me on this busy Friday afternoon, and Dr. Lokhandwala assessed  possible treatment. Even though they are busy next week, they carved a slot out for me  next Tuesday to decide exactly what we should do.  I am very grateful for my excellent care today and always!</text>

Once again Dr Lockhandwala went out of her way to solve my dental issues.
Myself being in pain and her having a full schedule, nevertheless she managed to extract my fractured tooth, make a graft in the bone and install the anchor for an implant in less than 3 hours.   All this painlessly and using her lunch and breaks time in between her other patients.
This kind of services is rarely found.
I have to commend Dr. Munira not only as a skillful professional but as a compassionate person to boot.
Thank you!</review>

<review>I have lock jaw. So I take a bit of extra time to take breaks when my jaw is starting to hurt from being open too long. The doctor's here are very aware and gentle with me. My 6 year old son loves coming here as well as my boyfriend. My friend brought her 4 year old son here to get his check up for Kindergarten and he loves them too. They are great with Children and you just can't find that right level of comfort for your child everywhere. Star Brite is definitely the place to go to have your teeth taken care of properly.<//review>< pictures>

StarBrite Dental is absolutely the best Dentist that my husband or I have ever been to. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit and will highly recommend StarBrite to all my friends. It was such a warm & happy & personal experience. They are so professional & qualified & really concerned. Dr Munira & her staff explained every detail of what was going on during my procedure. I have never felt so comfortable nor had such a wonderful dentist visit before. I am looking forward in getting all my dental needs taken care of with StarBrite.<//review>

<Text>Excellent work!!!  Star Brite and Dr. Lokhandwala have managed to foster a pleasant, relaxing atmosphere and professional courteous staff.  Over the years I've been seen by three of the on staff Dentists and all of them have a soft precise touch that translates into fast recovery times and  minimal pain.  They worked within the limits of my insurance company to keep my out of pocket expenses to a minimum.  I have my whole family being taken care of by StarBrite!<//Text>< pictures>

<text>I called star brite because I had a broken tooth that was causing me extreme pain.  Like most people I only go to the dentist when something is wrong.  The ladies at the front desk were sweet and the nurse that did my days was so friendly and made me feel very welcome.  I was seen by dr. Maryum Tariq.  This woman is amazing.  She was sweet, knowledgeable and didnt make me feel horrible at all.  She numbed me up really good and I never felt the needle go in.  I barely felt any pressure when she performed the extraction and was done in a matter of minutes.  She took away any fear I had about the dentist.  If they were more like her maybe I would have went more. Lol.  Anyway I highly recommend this practice.  If you don't like the dentist this place will change your mind.  Thank you again dr Tariq for making my dentist visit one of the best I have had in a long time.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

they can do it "all" eliminating the need to see a general then to a specialist.  very skilled and gentle given the circumstance.  staff is responsive to your needs with biscotti and coffee to start our your visit.< /Review>

This dental office has a GREAT team of people - everyone from the front desk to the doctors share the passion and goal of making a positive difference in their patient's lives.  They took on my case without hesitation after 2 other dentists flatly refused to work on me due to possible medical complications.  I have total confidence in StarBrite Dental, and that's not something I say lightly!  I'm delighted that they are opening a 2nd office so more people will have the opportunity to have a positive dental experience.< /Text>

<text>I went to Starbrite to save money on an implant...I’ll go back because of the excellent care and service I received.  I had been laid off and my dentist in LOS Gatos wanted over 10k ....so I looked elsewhere.  I found Starbrite and I’m so glad I did.  The cost was about a third of what the other dentist quoted. All of the staff and dentists were wonderful I never had to wait, during any appointment, and everything was so easy.  I usually HATE going to a dentist even to have my teeth cleaned...but the injections for anesthesia at Starbrite were almost not noticeable.  I HIGHLY recomemment Starbrite for tooth implants...you won’t be sorry.< /text><GmapID>0x808fbf7e8de89c8d:0xc0129b7ed607601c< /GmapID><Rating>5< /Rating><Resp>{'time': 1535735265117, 'text': "Thank you for your kind words and such a nice review, Sue!

<Review>The dentist she refused to help me when I came to her in pain. I came to her with a problem she couldn't address, she referred me to another doctor who could fix my tooth in 3 weeks. When I asked her for pain killers and antibiotics to hold me until he could see me, she refused and told me she couldn't give me anything to stop the pain. Stated I would need to get the procedure done as soon as possible if I wanted the pain to end. I waited a week in pain to see her, only to have no help when I get there. I was in even worse pain when I left, she watched me walk out in tears of pain and didn't care. I've never been refused service, and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Worst place ever I will not be back.<//Review><date>1485059314609</date></record>

<Name>Shhhessh G< /Name><review>So glad to have found this dental office. Being new to the Bay area l did not have a clue were to start l read several reviews from many dental offices and all had a mix of reviews. Star Bright dental had great reviews about there wonderful staff and l couldn't agree more 100%  they are friendly professional and most of all capable to answer all your questions from insurance to procedure steps. They were able to fit me in that same day on two different occasions with busy patient schedules they made it happen for me. Let me not forgot there prices were reasonable for a patient who was in between open enrollment they worked with me l didn't have to break the bank.

<text>I visited StarBrite Dental for quick consultation about fast braces and I have good experience with the staff and Dr. Lokhandwala.
Dr. Lokhandwala sounded very knowledgable and straight forward while making me understand why I am not eligible for fast braces. And how there is no shortcut when we want to get the right treatment for long term/life long benefits.
I would definitely like to go there again!< /text>< Pics>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>I am one of those people who is super scared to even think about going to a dentist. I was recommended by my brother who had seen Dr. Munira and Dr. Tarik. Right from stepping in to the clinic, I was treated with exceptional care. Staff is very friendly and professional. Dr. Tarik is the best dentist ever! She did my deep cleaning in two appointments. She is very caring and really listens to you. She does not rush things and takes the time to complete the procedure with frequent breaks in between to help you relax your jaw. She will also explain you what she is going to do at each and every step. Will keep going back as long as I live in east bay.</text>< GmapID>

<text>So glad to have found this dental office. Being new to the Bay area l did not have a clue were to start l read several reviews from many dental offices and all had a mix of reviews. Star Bright dental had great reviews about there wonderful staff and l couldn't agree more 100%  they are friendly professional and most of all capable to answer all your questions from insurance to procedure steps. They were able to fit me in that same day on two different occasions with busy patient schedules they made it happen for me. Let me not forgot there prices were reasonable for a patient who was in between open enrollment they worked with me l didn't have to break the bank. Dr Munira Lokhandwala was amazing she was very caring and patient with me and explained in details the facts of risk of my procedure. Her number one goal was to relieve me of any pain and discomfort which she achieved she took her time she showed compassion and as a new patient in alot of pain.

Looking at the facility from the outside, I was a bit reluctant to proceed but all that notion was behind me as soon as I started to talk to the staff members @ Starbrite. I found them to be well trained professionals who were well organized, efficient, polite & cared for their patient. The doctor herself seemed knowledgable & didn't just start working on my teeth cleaning. She had her staff take X-rays & digital pics of my mouth & showed me what needs to be fixed, where & how.
A big thumbs up to the Starbrite team from my end.<//text>

< Review>
We had a couple of cavities with our 3 year old. Needless to say, we were pretty anxious (and scared too) and weren't sure how our daughter would take the whole procedure. Dr. Lokhandwala was phenomenal with our kid - she talked our daughter in settling down without scaring her, sang her favorite nursery rhymes through the whole process, took extra care to ensure that our baby didn't see any scary instruments. The whole job was done in 10-15 mins, our baby didn't even require any numbing and to our surprise she was all smiles and high-fives at the end of procedure. We were super happy with the whole experience. Kudos to Dr. Lokhandwala on a terrific job.</Review>

We switched to StarBrite from our other dentistry about a year ago and haven’t looked back.

Dr. Hosseini and her associates have provided two implants and a replacement crown for us.  And unlike other dentists we’ve used, Star Brite has the marvelous convenience of crowns-made-while-you-wait, saving us delays, an extra visit, and expense.

Appointment schedules are convenient to us -- we live 40 miles away (!) and appreciate that StarBrite schedules us so as to miss rush-hour traffic.

Dr. Hosseini provides dental health instruction and explains techniques that help us prevent dental health problems.  With her professional care she emphasizes comfort, gentleness and precision.

The dental offices are neat and orderly. Information is provided about treatment options, fees and payment plans before treatment is scheduled.  Helpful, timely appointment reminders are sent by e-mail.

<text>I don't usually write reviews but since I dread going to a dentist, I have to write this review.

They do an amazing job! The front desk is friendly and I have been for three appointments now and never had to wait more than 5-10 minutes to get my number. I came here for one oral examination and two deep cleaning appointments and it was so smooth. I was so scared at first looking at all the deep cleaning videos but Dr. Tarik (I hope I spelled it right) made it such a great experience for me. She is so gental and comforting. Very understanding towards her patients and makes sure the process goes as smooth as possible. Dr. Munira and Dr. Tarik gave me some great tips to help my gums heal faster and how to take care of my teeth afterwards.

I'm coming back for a crown soon and I'm more excited than scared for my appointment. I will highly recommend this place to anyone who's scared of dentist appointments. They really are awesome! And I feel so much better after my deep cleaning. Great job! Keep up the good work.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<review>After being a patient at StarBrite dental for several years, I'm continuously pleased with the level of service I receive from the staff: Administration and Dental. Everyone is friendly and knows what they are doing. I've gone to dental offices where the dentist talks to me for a few minutes and leaves the rest to their assistants. This is not the case at StarBrite. Polishing and exam prep is completed by a medical assistant, but the actual cleaning and thorough exam is performed by the dentist. The only thing I do find a little strange is that I've had different dentists every few visits. Not sure if this common practice in this office or across the board in this industry. I've liked each of the dentists at StarBrite as they are all pretty consistent.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<review>Aproximately 10 months ago, I walked into Star Brite Dental for the first time ever, for a Sixth Month Smile consultation. After receiving the go ahead from Dr. Lokhandwala, we began my journey to straight teeth. Through every appointment, the Doctor and her staff were completely awesome! They answered every question and concern, and accomplished successfully every request I made. It took about eight months to get my top front teeth out of cross bite and into a fabulous smile. They made my braces journey pleasant and comfortable as much as they possibly could. Not only was the service and dentistry great, but so was the pricing. For my top teeth I paid approximately $3,500, and that included retainers, all appointments, a little bit of minor gum surgery, and of course the braces themselves. Because I'm not rich ( and didn't have insurance at the time), I couldn't pay this all at once.So, a flexible payment plan was available to pay, and included no interest on my payments for a year through Care Credit. Awesome!

I am so happy with the results!  My teeth are straight and AWESOME! This is the best care I have ever received from a dentist and ALL the staff. I would recommend Star Brite Dental to anyone who wants to experience quality, affordable, kind, professional service. Five stars hands down!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<text>Dr. Lokhandwala's dental practice is one of the best in the world, they have state of the art equipment and the focus on hygiene and sterilization is just amazing.
My family has been visiting her since early 2011 and we are very satisfied with her clinic.

Just recently my wife was experiencing pain in her jaw; since it was after hours, the afterhours message center took our message and after sometime Alka quickly got back to us, Dr. Suman examined my wife’s situation and discussed the next steps.
Dr. Munira also later followed up with me the next time I saw her.

Highly Recommended!!!<//text>< pictures>

The BEST PLACE FOR ALL YOUR DENTAL CONCERNS - I had a wisdom tooth removed by Dr.Munira ...she is the sweetest dentist i have ever come across. I was helped by Amy all throughout the procedure who took care of me all the while i was suffering from pain.
Dr. Muniras charm worked n my wisdom tooth was removed in a jiffy... I experienced slight discomfort for few mins after the anaesthesia wore out but i was good to go with a sumptous meal of nihari(mutton stew) even after the extraction in the morning.
Hurray to Star brite !!!!!
I am soooo happyyyyy :-)))
Thank you sooo much Dr.Muniraaa n amy<//Review>

<date>1382028646516</date><Rating>5</Rating><review>After my first visit, I was far less nervous about going to the dentist than I ever have been before.  Dr. Lokhandwala is the gentlest dentist I have ever been to.  Not to mention that the entodontist she referred me to (for the root canal) used nitrous oxide (laughing gas) at my request (the first time THAT has ever been available to me) and my root canal was no problem at all.  For my implant, Dr. Lokhandwala used a relaxant and I don't know what all.  I fell asleep in the waiting room and woke up to be told that she was nearly finished.
Dr. Lokhandwala listens carefully to everything I say and has an excellent "bedside manner".
Finally I won't have to be in trepidation about my dental visits.
Thank you.<//review>< Pictures>

After a long search I found Dr. Lokhandwala on the Internet. After calling and talking with her I felt comfortable enough to have her preform the implant procedure. At that time I lived in Pacifica and was more than willing to drive all the way to Fremont due to the cost savings. And I couldn't have made a better choice. The facilities are excellent, the staff is wonderful and Dr. Lokhandwala is superb. I now have my smile back and couldn't be happier. I also plan to have some cosmetic work done in the near future and I'm looking forward to visiting Dr. Lokhandwala and her staff again.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>I am so glad that I found StarBrite Dental! I used to go from dentist to dentist until I found StarBrite. Dr. Huseinni, Dr. L and Dr Beedu are all so good. I am going through a dental implant right now and it is nowhere near the horror stories that I heard from other people getting it done at other places. I like how Dr. Husseinni anesthesizes. I was waiting to feel it, but she was done and I didnt even feel a thing! And because it is a privately owned practice, they are willing to work with you on how to make your out of pocket payments.</text>< rate>

Do yourself a favor and just don’t waste your money and time on this company. We ordered a refrigerator back in November and had to wait until February for delivery. February comes and they cancelled twice, TWICE because the “truck broke down”. I called to for a refund and waited an hour until someone picked up all just to tell me that I need to come into the store for a refund.<//text>

Store employees are smart... kind.... patient and amazingly dedicated to making sure your experience is five star.  Each and every time I shop there.  Love it.  Jammie went beyond in helping us with the display purchase and getting it down from a very risky high location.  Thank you!<//Review>

Service people is very good!! But the store always is a mess!! At the lumber and drywall aisle is always blocked because they put all the cars with online orders and is impossible to reach what you need. Also, if you move them they comes to you!!
I been looking for some materials and like I’m a contractor I use to check on line for the products and quantity on stock but they even don’t have them on the store (and this happens me many times at this location). A year ago the store was very different. I don’t like to do this comments but after one and other one you come tired of bad service. The beer on the photo is from a employee who was “cleaning” the contractor parking.</Review>

It saddens Me to know that such a Good Knowledgeable Kid named Philip was let.go from this Home Depot. The Kid knew where everything was and he was always so Helpful and Honest. Nowadays I walk in there to ask another young man where a certain whatever it is that I need at that moment and they never know where anything is. They send Me to the Service station,  thats what I'm trying to avoid. I'm on a mission damnit going forward Not backwards. Been disappointed these handful of times I've visited. YOU NEED MORE PHILIP'S or just that young man named Philip.</review>

This company is a mess! Been in twice this week checked website both times for availability of items. When I go in person to buy they are out of stock. Second time I went home to place online order for pick up. Purchased 2 items which website says are in stock at the same store (which were not on shelves 10 minutes prior). After completing transaction noticed they had pick up at 2 different stores! Called and cancelled order!<//Text>

You can find most all home improvement product(s) you need at Home Depot.

Don't waste your time searching at Target, Walmart, Ace Hardware, etc.  If Home Depot DOESN'T carry the home improvement product(s) you need, you're in for a long search.< /Text>

< Review>
I'm in this store twice a week and every time I'm in there, 90% of customers don't even wear their mask and employees don't even care to tell them to put on a mask. After talking a with floor supervisor his response was " covid is a joke, we don't care if customers don't wear a mask. The county will never shut us down. We have the rights to not enforce the mask policy "< /Review>

Was looking for an orchid (potted plant )
I asked three people in the garden dept. and no one could say whether or not you had any.
One associate said that maybe inside on isle 1 or 2.
( No, Let me assist you.
( No, Would you like me to get someone to help you.
( No nothing!
After going inside and looking through a jungle of plants we finally found them.
They were the worse orchids I've ever seen. Dead flowers, wilted leaves, bare and broken stems ECT!
Come on people, I am certain that you can/need to due.better.than this.< /text>

Just wish that the handicap shopping cart had a full charge because it almost died on me when I was using it. Maybe the employees at the returns register should check that they are plugged in while not in use. Then maybe they will always have a full or close to full charge when a customer needs to use one. Other than that, the employees that I encountered this evening were all very nice and helpful.<//review>< pictures>

<rating>1<//rating><text>🚩SERIOUS RED FLAG! I had to come to the customer service desk for work reasons. The waiting line is right in front of the front door where people are entering and encroaching on those waiting in line. EVEN MORE: when it was my turn to be served, I had to deal with the serious discomfort of carts piled near I was standing while the nice employee was dealing with computer bull____. Because of that cart pile, many shoppers came close to bumping into me. I wrote this review after this frightening trip on August 9, 2020. So, If I get the coronavirus within this next week, I'll probably know where it came from... HERE<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Gmap_id>

<review>You can find pretty much everything work related and cheaper too! It's also very organized and the items are easy to find. Some of the employees there go out of their way to help you a lot, but then there's some who don't give even the slightest damn about helping you or they just downright ignore you. Aside from that, they're alright.<//review>< userid>

Self checkout is a joke never any employees around to help when you need it pretty much sums up every home Depot countrywide</Review>

<Review>Customer service could be better, it's such a big store so that aspect is likely difficult to manage. Speaking of that, this store has about everything you could need or want for almost any job or project. It's truly do it yourself, including locating products while shopping.< /Review>< pics>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>DON'T BUY FLOORING AT HOME DEPOT!!!!!!!!!!!!

On June 3, 2020, I went to Home Depot for laminate flooring. All the signs said "8 Day Delivery if Not in Stock", so I assumed that the flooring would be delivered within two weeks. The flooring has to stay in the house for a few days before it can be installed, then two or three days for the install.  Even with a week extra, it fit my timeline and I paid for flooring and installation.

The sales guy was very helpful, and I got a phone call updating me on what would happen. It all seemed good.

Two weeks come and go. No flooring and no word. I call. They say they will get back to me. I call again. They finally get back to me-the flooring will arrive on July 2, 2020. (Four weeks from the order date.)  The installation will be a week later.

Two days before the delivery they call. The delivery window is 8 AM to 6 PM. They did not tell me that the "delivery" would be to my yard. If I had known that, I would have had someone on call to help me. I did not know that, so I had to unload a full pallet of laminate from the yard into the basement all by myself OR leave it in the yard for someone to steal.

At age 62, I unload a full pallet of laminate from my yard to the basement.

So now, today, we are at week five. The installers are set to arrive between 8 AM- 10 AM. They arrive at 12:05.

Twenty minutes later, the installers say the floors are far to unlevel and there is no way to install them. They pack up and leave.

Five weeks in and Home Depot is telling me "Oh, well, these things happen." I said "You sent out a guy to measure and assess! He told me the floors were level!!!"  The customer service person says "Well, he really can't tell, the installers are the ones who can tell..."

If I have known on June 3 that an installer would show up 5-1/2 weeks later to tell me the job was impossible, I never would have paid Home Depot $4,700.

UPDATE: I had a contractor friend come in to level it. He says there should be no problem, it's just a couple of places. He says those guys probably did not want to carry the laminate up from the basement.

I just tried order on line and pick-up and it made it easier to get what I wanted and purchase it quicker than going there and shopping.
You can just about order what you need for a project. It makes it a lot easier. I will be ordering and pick-up again... But I'll also still go to shop for gardening, so I can see what they have.< /review>

Phone doesn’t answer. Very few people working, and the few are busy doing stuff but not available to help, when available they know little about any detailed question, desk people too busy , totally unreasonable. In addition, no 6 feet distance and no face masks half the time. When I pointed that to them they responded with sardonic indifference. Lousy customer service. A real low quality joint.< /Review>

<text>I have had a few great experiences at this store where people have gone out of their way to be helpful and several horrible experiences. Recently I ordered an item online. I was notified it was available for pickup. When I arrived at the store I waited in line to be helped. Then I waited while customer service tried to get back into the area where the item was supposed to be. First they had to call help to move a door that another customer was picking up and no one could lift. Then someone else needed help. Finally she went to look for it and it was not there. I told her I would come back. I finished my errands and decided to call before making the trek back to see if they had it. Turns out they don’t have any in the store despite their inventory saying they have 5. Could she have been bothered to notify me in the next 3 hours? No, too busy, which I am sure is true having seen the disorganized way they run that “customer service” area.<//text>< pictures>

Fantastic Selection/ Employees realistically too few for the space.
TIPS >>>
○Receipts= DO NOT PUT CLEAR PACKING TAPE FROM REGISTER ON TOP OF TEXT IT WILL BE ERASED.
○Time= TO MAKE THE BEST USE OF IT, LOOK UP WHAT YOU NEED ONLINE WHEN POSSIBLE, IF ITS ANY LARGE ITEM FROM OUTSIDE or LUMBER, GET IT DELIVERED TO YOU IF POSSIBLE. OTHERWISE, PLAN ON SOME TIME WAITING FOR FORKLIFT OPERATORS.
○ Step back and take a breath_ the less you go there when everyone else does, the more zen your experience will be. Take a stroll thru the ferns> the oxygen is good for you. Oh..and if you see a man with a goatee and glasses..he's the one who has the answer.Promote that guy. Tim? Tom? What was it? Wow.<//review>

Of course I went to get flash lights, batteries and a couple other items we needed. Had the pleasure of meeting two team associates.  One with a red wig and another with a curly wig. Made my day. Stay safe during this fire danger alert. Remember your neighbors too. Check on each other.</text>

<Text>Unfortunately, it is the only game in town. The lumber/plywood section is usually a mess. Product is on the floor, mixed up and frequently no price tag. Plumbing fittings mixed up and rarely any help.
I wish someone there actually cared!
Actually, some of the cashiers are friendly and efficient!</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHRu3jgg-JH9mkCEM_SB491lIG_kK7_NToi3L_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4KFJmLUWtRSb200kGWpcfosZFe1RMrtOzr1EY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZUhYIf8y15TZFsk1b3I8mBVcL8PoyVdTwixx1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures></record>

I needed to get a power washer for work, and Bill from plumbing went out of his way to help me in a department that wasn't his. He made a great effort to get me someone from the garden department,  but was unsuccessful  he helped me get exactly what I need and loaded it on to the flatbed cart.
Thank you Bill< /Text>

The Home Depot Napa could stand improvement, it isn't the same as it was years ago. But I must say they have one of the best part departments in the area. I have always found them knowledgeable and helpful. The young lady in the afternoon did some color matching and recommended a paint base that worked out fine. There is another gentleman there that works mornings that has a great knowledge of the different paints, application and problem solving. I've never been disappointed.</Text>

Always a mixed feeling here... lots to buy, but customer service as far as knowledge of the various products is sometimes but not always lacking.  I would give 4 stars, but trying to get an answer over the telephone is almost impossible and can take several attempts.  ... very frustrating. Plus, having pro-rewards is good, but there was not a way to get the rewards on an online purchase of appliances, thus forcing an hour long phone call or spending more online.  This needs to be fixed. I was buying probably 6 or 7 major appliances a year for my job and it was always a hassle.</review>

Worst customer service ever, paid cash,  exchanged product, refused to refund my money, so now I have  some worthless store credit.  And they have my cash.  Corporate ripoff at it's best.  I am of the understanding that the law is on my side, what say you legal professionals?<//review>

I used Home Depot's In-Store pickup option to buy a vanity. When my Fiance and I arrived to the Napa store the vanity we ordered was completely broken. Without hesitation one of the employees offered to take us back to see if there was another vanity we liked. We were then given the new vanity and a nicer sink for no extra charge even though it was a good amount more than the one we originally ordered!

The staff were all very helpful and patient. Probably one of the best Home Depot's in the area.<//review>

I went to go pick up mini fridge and took me an hour to get it. Never updated me about it. Customer service is horrible. Seemed like they don’t want to work. Very poor experience. Thank you Napa Home Depot.</Text>

My experience with the custom cabinetry department, particularly when you've made an appointment, is 5 stars. This review is for every other experience I've had at this Home Depot.

Finding help in the store is very difficult, and the quality if the help when found is hit and miss. More often miss. Finding specific items is time consuming because everything is very poorly labeled. Many items are in the the wrong location. Many items are damaged. The store layout is horrible, made much worse by the fact that they cram things into every aisle.

Many items are well priced, but many are overpriced. All in all, if I need advice I go elsewhere. If I know exactly what I need and where it is located, I go there. If I know what I need but not where it is, I go but know that I will be there for 2 hours.</Review>

It is Home Depot. You go in, security follows you around pretending to be a customer(that up sales in the isle) you grab your soil while they escort you too the front. You pay they disappear. Same thing every time. And all the customers I overhear feel the same way, you wouldn't be worried about thieves as much if you did not over price seasonal items.</Review>

After being a loyal customer for nearly 30 years and spending in excess of  200,000 dollars on my home projects and always enjoying my shopping experience and dealing with the most helpful home depot employees. I have had my worst retail experience in my life today at the Napa Home depot store. 3/8/2015 at 3:00pm. I started on a project approx 6 weeks ago and have spent to date 9,000$ on my home depot account in a couple of the surrounding Home depot's. Today I had a return of approx $250 worth of extra materials and had the unfortunate encounter with Karen in the Napa store. Simply wanted to return the materials and receive an in store credit on my account. To which she said I would need to return the items to the store they were purchased in. To simplify things I suggested she just issue a store credit. She was condescending and rude. She should not be representative of home depot. She then called for manager assistance at that point she received a phone call keeping me waiting for at least 15 minutes and long enough for her to chew what seemed to be 3 packs of bubble gum. They finally agreed to  give me the in store credit which they should understand is only a win win solution for both parties. After the transaction she continued to be very unprofessional and down right rude. I intend on taking this miserable experience to corporate tomorrow. In closing and any one reading this, the home depot in Vallejo is well worth your effort!

This is for sure the worst Home Depot I ever been to, the customer service is horrible when you ask for assistance they make it seem like there doing you a favor and  only if you can actually find anyone willing I would try your best to avoid the place or have fun trying to get someone to help you... Good Luck!<//Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>The same for the past 6 years. Poor service. Very poor service overall. From in store to their screaming “hold on” for another 30min on the phone service. Imagine the type of service you get at an Apple Store. Well, this is the opposite. It’s more like a jaded flight attendant whom is on her / his 8th red eye in a row and they are 2 days from retirement type service. Why Home Depot don’t you at least strive for something greater. It’s not hard. It really isn’t.

UPDATE
Jon (not the manager John) was super helpful and professional in trying to resolve our issues. He is leaps and bounds ahead of the others there. Sadly our delivery arrived damaged and half of it was missing. And the 2nd delivery the next day was also damaged. Home Depot say their delivery company is 3rd party and isn’t very good. But then get a new delivery company!</text>< Pictures>

Buyer be aware and whatever you do, don't go to Home Depot in Napa for flooring. It is turning into a nightmare shakedown. They quoted me $25 K for the job, which I paid in full. Then they called me and said I owed them another $6K because  they made a mistake and they said I had to pay it before they could start my job.  They were holding the start of my flooring job hostage. Now I"m  out $31 K or upwards of $14 per square foot for tile and carpet. They scheduled a second walk through today with their installer said
that they would'nt move my antique  furniture, although the cost of moving my furniture was paid for and in my contract.  I contacted them because I had to cancel  the rooms where I had antiques because I am elderly and disabled and can't move it myself.  They said that I had to pay a 15% restock fee,  if I cancelled. I couldn't believe it, another hostage situation or shakedown, so I said proceed.  I am so afraid of what may be coming next.<//Review>

The Napa store is one of the worst I've ever been in. The overall selection of products is not in tune with reality. Not a full line of items that go together. The help is nonexistent, the parking is a joke most of the time. I've been in the Auburn store and it blows this store away.</Text>

Regardless of what department and what time of day I've never seen employees more clueless about The store's products and Application. It's almost like they intentionally hire people who know absolutely nothing about anything that's relevant.<//Text>

Horrible customer service. Waited over an hour to talk to a window guy about an order and was never helped. I left empty handed with nothing. Sometimes it's worth it to go somewhere that costs a little more but you get more of a personal service.</Text>

<Date>1538004649396</Date><text>This Home DEPOT in Napa, California was  the worst store I have ever been in my life. The Workers where Not helpful at all & Rude & Disrespectful. They all Profiled Me the 1 person that I thought was maybe helpful was rude & asked me questions like are you buying all of this 'i said Yes' ( it was not a whole lot just about $200.00 ) then he said or you buying it with a Gift Card ' I said No cash money '.  Then when I got up towards the counter that guy had pointed to the customer service desk & said that the guy thier would help me . & Since I had never been thier I had a few small items that I changed my mind on through out the store that I had found other things that would be sutable for what I needed. So instead of just setting them where they did not belong I offered them to the guy at Customer Service. I said to him Nice Ring ( cause he had a really Nice trippy Silver  Stone ring on) then I said - I changed My mind on these I do not want them. Then he said to Me ' WHAT YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST GO THROUGH THE STORE & PICK SOME ITEMS & THEN BRING THEM UP TO THE COUNTER & GET A REFUND FOR THEM.(very disrespectful & rude tone)   I said what are you talking about I have been here for at least 2 hours & I have this Bigg flat Cart of stuff I am purchasing . I just Changed My Mind on those few  Items. Then THE JERK  turned & went to the end of the counter & just ignored Me & (was tryn to ignore me. But I made sure to say what I had to say In the End) then some other cashier Chic helped me & she was Also Rude. I said a few things like am not paying with a Gift card or a stolen credit card I have plenty of cash on me ( at least $500.00) I told the guy he Owed Me appology. He appologized his name is EDRIS Home DEPOT Napa. Then when I was putting the items on the Utility trailer & in my Jeep all by My self cause no one offered to assist Me ( 3 bundles of rooffing shingles that are Extermly heavy & some ²x⁴ s wood stuff & Big sheet of Mesh screen & other items) they missed ringing me up on like 10 small cork like bags that was covered part way by the shingles cause they was to busy being Rude to me to  pay attention to thier job. So I took the small bags back In side  & said that they had forgot to ring me up for them .
What a  theiving foul person  I am to come back In .. then I said
I May Live in Vallejo but Vallejo Home DEPOT is alot better then thier Profiling Asses .    I do not recommend the Napa Store I had to give it 1 Star just to be able to leave my Opinion or I would not give it a Star at ALL . I spent about $300.00 that Evening  never again in NAPA HOME DEPOT<//text><UserId.>102871445646705119611< /UserId.><Response>None<//Response><rate>1< /rate></record>

Bought a grill and it broke after one use...went to return the grill and all of the boxes were so smashed up it was already a losing situation. After unwrapping and starting to assemble the second grill several parts were bent. The only positive experience I have had at this store was buying flowers at the beginning of summer. Seriously don't waste your time it is worth the drive to find a Lowes!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

There is no Lowe's in Napa, otherwise I would never step foot in this store ever again. I have been treated very badly every time I shop at Home Depot. Every time I ask for help, someone tells me it's not their department and walks away.

They also have these buttons you can press in the middle of aisles for help. I have pressed these multiple times because I can never find anyone employees and not once has anyone ever came and helped. I even spoke to a manager to let him know what horrible service the store has and he completely blew me off. If I didn't have a newborn and a 2 year old I would make the drive to Lowe's every time.<//review>

< Review>
Worst store on the Planet. I wanted to spend $2,000. plus on Appliances there and couldn't find anyone to help me for a long period of time. They are way understaffed and to try and find someone in the vast isle to ask just one question is almost impossible. You have to walk a mile just to get back to the front where if you are lucky you will find someone who will then point in the direction of an acre where you must once again venture out and try to find your item. HORRIBLE PLACE!!!!!< /Review>

<text>01/16/18 4:30pm A customer lost a bag of 80lb concrete center of the intersection of soscol and kansas. I a former worker took the task of removing the 80lb bag, though it was not mine after seeing a motor cyclist neerly crash after narowly avoiding the dense thick object. Unfortunatelt the bag split and scattered sand and rock all over myself and the road the right thing to do quickly turned into a mess. After this i quickly turned to almighty HD i asked for assistance to clean, to avoid the slick sand an rock now scattered across the road (hazardous yet again after my thought of intervention). Unfortunatly managment didn't think it was important and denied the thought of providing the slick wax cleaner they dont sell instore but have in hand to clean their own messes (knowing from experience) also denied any help allowing those who are trained in such clean up procedure to help sweeping or securing the main road to their establishment. Maybe i did to much trying to help out but its a product they sell less then 100yards away from their front door. Extremely dissapointed hope no accident is made from this experience.<//text></record>

Friday afternoon ... needed four 2 by 6 boards cut into two ... stood in cutting center waiting for assistance for 30 min .... no employees to be seen ... asked twice at the check out stand for someone to man the cutting center .... returned for a third time the lady said ''Oh that the cutting center saw was not working'' .... NO OUT OF ORDER SIGN... I went over to the trim and molding area to use the manual saw.... teeth missing on saw making it that much harder... afterwards went to get a drink of water... out of order too... no water... on the way back through lumber made a comment to the employee now there, said it did not know the saw was out of order... whats the deal people... told the check out guy my story,,, he could care less... called to talk with the manager ... was put on hold and forgotten... the quality of employees is at an all time low !!!</review>

<Text>If I could give a zero star rating, I would definately do it..

IF YOU ARE DELIVERING A LOAD HERE, CALL THESE PEOPLE TO CONFIRM EVEN THOU IF YOUR DISPATCHER/BROKER IS SAYING THAT WE HAVE AN APPT. TIME..

Showed up to deliver a load of water at 635am on 3/24/17.. had a 7am delivery appt time so yes I was bit early. She told me I have no appt time whatsoever but she will try to work me in.. 19 pallets in trailer n this receiving lady Leslie totally lost it n said receiving hrs are from 8am to 11am.. I been delivering to other home depots n all have receiving hrs from 7am to certain time..

Then she told me if I want to pull the pallets by myself then it's fine otherwise I would have to wait till 8ish.. I had other load scheduled to pickup at 9am so I decided to unload by myself with a gotdamn hand jack.. Mind you, each pallet is abt 2350 lbs.. Started pulling my 1st pallet n she woke up from coma n asked how many pallets do I have for her even thou I handed her the Bills when I checked in.. When she realized it's full truck load of 19 pallets for her, she made me push the pallet back into the trailer n pull out of the dock n come back around 815ish.. SHE NEEDS TO WORK ON HER CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS

Simple thing, if you don't feel like working or too tired to work in Friday, quit working n stay home</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

The most racist unhelpful employees work there. first Franklie is extremely rude and unhelpful when he finally decides to  help you end up standing in another department for 45 minutes waiting to be "helped' and apparently there is never a manager working or they are on permanent lunch breaks.
aka the employees know they are going to be complained about so they lie to the customers.<//Review>

If I could give a zero star rating I would....  I purchased a charcoal grill from here and used it a single time and the welds started falling apart! The lid fell off backwards for crying out loud! Then when I returned the grill I was nearly ignored at the customer survice counter by a very rude employee that clearly wanted nothing to do with me.   We exchanged it for another grill which I opened when I got home to assemble it, and after inspecting the parts in the box I found that 4 different parts were extremely damaged due to mis-handling in the store.  The table on it was bent at a 45 degree angle making it unusable, the legs had numerous scratches and scrapes, the bottom shelf had a puncture in it, and the lid had a dent! What kind of place is this that would sell such products and disrespect there customers in such a way! After I return this second grill tomorrow I plan on never returning and taking my business elsewhere! Take caution when visiting this home depot and watch out for damaged merchandise!  The home depot is nothing but worthless and I wish there was a Lowes close by.....</Text>

<text>Handful of helpful employees but not many. Store is a pigsty, you can't find anything, every bin is a mish mash of things. Real mess. I lived her for ten years, moved away for 18 months and lived near a Lowes...like night and day compared to this store. Sorry I'm back to having to deal with HD at this location. The Napa location must make a fortune for HD since we are stuck with it as our only real choice.<//text><date>1419961976736<//date><gmapID>0x80850611d5cb0cb3:0x58c5886cbf8786b3< /gmapID><Pics>None<//Pics><Name>Brent Farlie< /Name><resp>None<//resp>< Rating>

<review>Without question, the Napa Home Depot store has got to be the WORST as it relates to customer service!  From the employees ambulating aimlessly around the store (everywhere indeed, except where they need to be when one needs to find them!)

We have done a couple of remodels in the last 5 years. One of them working with the Salt Lake City Fort Union store, the other in and around the Napa Valley. What a difference in work ethic, level of knowledge, and willingness to help on the part of the employees at both stores!!! While the SLC employees in all departments were courteous, went out of their way to help, and knew their stuff, the people at the Napa store --whenever one can find someone-- were apathetic, dumb and even dismissive.

Just yesterday, I went to ask a simple question at the paint dept. and could find no one behind the desk. When I did find somebody in one of the aisles, the guy spoke broken English and answered my questions with a sneering attitude.

I'll be politically incorrect here and just get to the point in the interest of brevity and truth: The fact is most of the employees seem to have been picked from one minority or another, perhaps to satisfy the obligatory quota system prevailing in this NorCal-Frisco-values-infected enclave. Unfortunately, the impression these people project is that they are either resentful of being employed, or that they are there strictly for an easy ride and a paycheck. They show absolutely no sense of commitment to their job.

Perhaps there's a pervasive lack of competence as well in the managerial pool, since apparently no one appears to be checking up on these poorly supervised employees who exhibit little time for customers, yet plenty of it for chit-chating and yucking it up with one another, for spending time talking on their cell phone, or for walking around with their hands inside their apron pockets.

I have finally opted to  avoid these Napa HD store 'human drones' and drive to Windsor or Rhonert Park to get better service. Even considering the additional expense in gas, the travel time, the higher Sonoma County tax rate, and half-spaced-out pot heads who work there, the Santa Rosa HD is slightly preferable.

Bottom line, Home Depot headquarters should do some sort of employe proficiency and motivation audit on the Napa store employees to improve this situation. Perhaps the only reason this store does not close, given the enormous waste and inefficiency that occurs there, is the fact that this is the only HD in the middle of a mostly rural area, and this perhaps helps to keep the sales volume consistently high. However, there's no reason the customers should have to suffer the inconvenience of having to travel afar to get satisfaction. I'd give this store ZERO stars, but the system in place does not allow it!

PS: Additionally, I am working with highly sought-after contractors on the current remodel, and they have made it abundantly clear to me that they will not do business with the Napa HD store, precisely for the reasons explained above!</review></record>

Called the Napa HD about a dado blade set and Tim in hdw knew right where to go and was knowledgeable ....explained that they were working on getting their employees a little more savvy on the inventory. So I dunno....for people who really know their stuff in hdw, sonoma Friedman's is best but be prepared to pay sonoma's tourist trap prices.</Text>

Everytime i have gone to this location, i can never find anyone to help, and the times i have found someone,  they don't know anything or get annoyed because you asked them a question. Overall, i hope they retrain the staff of guest services an staff the store accordingly.<//Text>

The employees are the most dismal and unhelpful of any brand of any place I've ever encountered. Their store manager is equally as poor.< /Review>

Poorly run store, when you ask for assistant no one care, I have waited 25 minutes  for employee to help after asking the customer service desk three times still no one showed up, Home Depot you do not deserve my business<//review>

<date>1621810545954< /date><text>I purchased about $500 worth of plantings right before we went into shelter in place. Unfortunately, a couple of the plants did not make it. Given my pre-existing medical conditions, I did not go to stores during the pandemic, which meant I could not return the dead plants until recently now that I received my vaccine. They didn’t even want to hear my side, which felt a bit inhumane.  The girl running ‘returns’ was quite rude, and said it’s been over a year since the plants were purchased. Again, I have not been inside the store in over a year, and I’m sure I’m not alone in this given Covid-19.  I’ll be heading to Friedman’s for all my future landscaping needs.</text>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) Incredible Variety of construction and home supplies, better organized than a few years ago. I like their quality, prices and ease of finding things. I think it is a large warehouse not only in Napa, but in the US in its specialty
