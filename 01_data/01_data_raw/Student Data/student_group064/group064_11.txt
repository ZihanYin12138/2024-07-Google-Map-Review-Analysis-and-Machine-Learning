I come here at least twice a week and I love the staff. The two older Latina ladies are always so nice and kind to me and even though there is a lot of homeless they never mistreat anyone or the homeless bother anyone. They even open the door for me. I love this fast food place and I would never say that. But their customer service is amazing I love it!< /text>

Drive through. Give the guy working the ‘drive through’ all stars. He’s doing the job nearly himself. With 1 guy in kitchen reheating the food, everything else is him. All these companies are laying people off & forcing others to pick up the leftovers.

Edit. The default star for the employees, -4 stars for recent delivery where utterly expensive through GrubHub (family meal -  3 whoppers, 3 cheeseburgers, 3 small fries) & the burger meat was old & dry, soggy tasteless fries....instant upset stomach & acid reflux; of which I never gotten from fresh cooking like from the fabulous “Habit”.

All forever done with this company & all it’s affiliates.< /Review>

Worst Burger King ever. They put a ton of mayo in the sandwiches. And we asked for extra pickles in one of them and they put no pickles. Terrible. Uneducated  people work here.< /Review>

Never in my time coming here have I ever had anyone give me attitude like the lady working drive thru today on 4/12/20 at 3:20. I placed my order and went I went to the window she gave me the wrong soda and when I told her she started to talk back saying that I didn’t order sprite when I did then when I asked for the receipt she said it was in the bottom of the bag I checked and it wasn’t there so I couldn't give them a review so the company could see.</text>

<Text>Slowest and worst Burger King I've ever been to. Not only are they always rude and charging for one extra sauce, you will literally be in the drive thru forever. Even if you just ordered one meal and even if you're the only car. Just had some tonight against my better judgement. Onion rings we're so hard I couldn't break them. They were ice cold and I was hitting them on the table and they wouldn't break. My chicken fries weren't fresh either. That was my last time going there ever.<//Text>< Pics>

I called to complain about the issue and the manger tried arguing with me and hung up tried calling  back ring tone is ball I got wow total lost for words and its crazy how people get treated when they pay their hard working.

<Text>I ordered thru drive thru.  Person refused to repeat my order at my request.  Went to window.  Again, didn't answer my question.  Wrong order given. Not going back to say something because it IS out of the way!  Since there is no Burger King close to me.  It closed.< /Text>< name>

< review>
It's been about 2 weeks since this incident. Wish there were a -1 billion way too much spread on the burgers. The soda machine looks like the ones like they have at jack in the box but they do not have most of the flavors so instead of 100+ flavors its more like 40. I also asked for fries no salt there was so much salt on the fries I litterley had to spit it out went and told them i asked for no salt cashier tried to say nobody asked for no salt that day let alone in the last 15 mins or so when I made my order..haha good thing I kept my reciept due to me paying debit so I kept it for my records. Showed reciept where it said no salt on fries then she tried to tell me they are preseasoned during packaging I asked her if all BK use same company. She said all the ones she has been to I asked how many is that she said this was the 7th bk she work at and all are the same fries and can't get with no salt I then asked to speak to manager she went to get her about 5 min later they both come out so I know cashier told her what she needed to make herself look innocent. I told manager about burger having too much condiments and the fries she said exactly what cashier told me so I asked why ive never had problems at any other bk and if I could not get without salt why didn't cashier tell me so manager said cashier didn't know I called them both out with their lies saying someone who has worked at 7 locations should know fries were preseasined and that it's never been a problem with other locations that the cashier lied and said no one had ordered without salt but reciept show I did manger kept saying my fault but she would replace the fries for only $1.50 charge I asked why the charge and it was because they had to charge for the thing fries come in, the oil to make the fries and for the new fries themself. I asked can they be with no salt she said no. So I ended up saying never mind I want money back she said couldnt refund it all I said that I would contact corporate all sudden they were able to give me full refund for the fries. Avoid this location at all costs and go to the one on canoga and Ventura. It's worth the drive to save the headaches. I took pics of over condimented burger but deleted after I posted shorter review on yelp<//review>

Staff has serious attitude issues. If you pay with a card they want to write down all your information on your drivers licence. Slow service, even with only 2 cars in the drive thur and an empty dining room.<//text>

<text>Foods ok, prices fair, but seems like every time I go here there frozen treat machine is not working. Also, the staff is not overly friendly.< /text>< Rate>

Great simple sandwich shop. And the proprietor is passionate about his sandwiches! He says he imports his turkey from South Carolina and has a special recipe for mayo. Default is served on a hotdog bun, not sure if you can choose anything else- next time I will ask. Cute neighborhood too.<//Text>

There’s no way to go wrong here. You get the exact sandwich that you ask for and it’s great. The owner is hilarious and the roasted Turkey and ham is amazing.</Text>

Went by, started to walk in, then noticed no one behind the prep area had any masks on.  Neither did the two customers I saw.

<name>Claire Chun< /name><time>1587967197342< /time><Rating>2< /Rating><text>Got the chicken sandwich and two roast beef sandwiches. The buns are nice and soft but the roast beef tasted off. Also, the cashier was really weird and unhelpful when giving details about the type of meats they served—what information I finally pulled out of him was wrong, as were my sandwich order options. Another oddity - I was given a litany of sandwich options, which seemed unnecessary - I just wanted lettuce, tomato, onions and mayo. But when I tried to tell the cashier the simple order, he insisted on robotically running through every single option available. To top it off, I definitely found the food underwhelming. There are definitely better sandwich places out there.< /text>< Pics>

Their sandwiches are mediocres at best, really underwhelming in general, using the worst possible cold cuts and industrial bread and supplies.

<Review>Excellent sandwich. Glad I went here instead of subway. The rapid order stuff put me off but I'm anti-social so that's on me. I'll be back.

Suggestion: Put some pre-set sandwiches on the menu, and let me choose between spicy or not. Also, maybe a which-which style form that I can hand over and take my own time to deliberate on.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

No pre-set sandwiches, all custom, with a bit of a basic/limited set of ingredients. The bread was a hot dog bun which was underwhelming. Ended up being $13 for a sandwich which paled in comparison to a Mr. Pickle's but it seemed like the guy running it was a great businessman and knew a lot of locals, which I did enjoy!</Text>

The reason why this is such a good sandwich shop is that all you need to do is ask for what you want. Simple. It's even easier because the owner will go through a bunch of sandwich ingredients and ask if you want them. Yes , no easy peasy.<//review>

Solid sandwich place. Perfect for customization. Guy at the register walks you through your options to help you build your sandwich the first time. Some simple yes or no questions (bacon? avocado?) or some choices, like which kind of cheese or mustard. And there are a lot of options you can choose from. They run through all these choices on a computer and print out your order to make sure it's right, and it sounds like they store it for any future orders too. I wish more places were run like this.

Can be a little easy to miss going past. There is paid street parking on the street right out front, or a lot behind the nearby Safeway. The only seating around is the benches on the sidewalk along the street.</review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>I absolutely love this place! Be prepared to answer many questions in quick succession about what you want on your sandwich. It does means you get full customizability over every single aspect of your sandwich that you could possibly think of. After you are done with your interrogation, your sandwich recipe then gets saved in the computer under your name. The sandwiches that I have gotten there over the years are some of the best sandwiches I have ever had in my life. It's just a shame that I never see any other costomers in there because the shop is a bit hidden and not many people know of it. Overall, I would highly recommend this place. Great customizability and great subs.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>Stopped in on this place on my way down to moving to LA. Hands down one of the best sandwich places I have ever been to. Certainly a great way to send off living in The Bay.<//review>< Gmap_id>

Skip subway and get a great sandwich here.  You will have to go through the pain of creating your own custom order, but it makes repeat visits super easy.

Pair with a Mexican coke and you'll have a fine meal.< /text>

Small sandwiches on nice soft hot dog bun bread.  Okay egg salad sandwich but very pricey for size.  Problem is, Montclair doesn't have a lot of sandwich options anymore so will probably be back.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

I ate here once with a few friends and was very disappointed. I felt the place could use a good cleaning. They asked me if I wanted my sandwich toasted and it looked as though they microwaved it. Regardless, my sandwich was  soggy and wet and not at all what I expected from a Philly cheese steak.< /Text>

We were about to head back to the bay when we  noticed the tire warning light and our tire was low. We pulled in to Miller Brothers and they straight away jacked up the car, found the nail, fixed the tire and had us on the road in less than half an hour in 100 degree heat too.  Amazing service and very reasonable price. Got us home safely.
Highly recommend them.< /Review>

God Help you if you are here. Figure your way around working with these folks. I was able to get coolant from these people but beware. There is no other Auto mechanic for miles literally. At the mercy of being miles out of town.< /text>

Circumstances meant I had to conduct all transactions over the phone long-distance.  They were reasonable, flexible and accommodating.  They met me at the shop after hours since it was the only time I could get there, and I immediately took the car on a road trip across two states.  It performed beautifully.  Their pricing was fair, their transactions were honest, and the work was top-notch.</Review>

<Text>Had an appointment at 1pm to have 4 tires put on. The person at the window denied any acknowledgement of the appointment which was made 6 days in advance. A younger gentleman said he would take us anyway and asked us to park the truck in front. He said it would take him about 45 minutes to complete. When we got back from a walk, there were two studs broken off and one of the lug nuts missing. The guy denied breaking them. He said they weren't there to begin with which is a lie because we have pictures of them all in tact two days before bringing the truck to them. They stated our pictures are useless and they have nothing to gain by lying. Fact of the matter is they poorly managed to keep the schedule they added us to, did a rush job and broke the studs off and did not want to take anymore time to fix their mistake and did not want to be financially responsible. Horrible place with inexperienced personnel and very unprofessional.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

These guys are the best. They are a local family owned and operated shop and they always seem to get me back on the road. They do quality work for a fair and honest price and I will be back to do business with them again. They are always pretty busy though so if you can call ahead and schedule an appointment I would do so!<//review>

We broke down out of Don Pedro in my F350 crew on Labor Day weekend in the late evening.  Rocky was the man. He called and let us know how long he would be , he kept to that schedule. He loaded us up truck and boat, and took us to Patterson.  Clean truck real nice guy, careful with my stuff.  Knew his business well.  Really took great care of us.  Highly recommend MB and especially Rocky</Text>

The guys are great, thoughtful and respectful. But if you have to negotiate with Donna, you are in bad situation. Rarely felt so exploited and badly treated in my life. I had a problem with a motorcycle, which had to stay over the weekend and Donna charged every single thing she could (including a 4-day stay of $260, even though the motorcycle stayed from Friday morning to Sunday morning, that is 3 days not 4) . And of course, since you dont have options, your hands are tied.<//Text>

Had the brake pads replaced on my Jeep and these folks were wonderful. Everything was done within and hour, everybody was pleasant, respectful, and I didn't have to rob a bank to pay for all! :-) I'll be returning here when I need help again.< /Text>

<text>We were on the side of the road with our brakes completely gone and these people took care of everything. Within the hour of calling them, myself and 5 friends were in an air conditioned office. Because we were stuck on the side of the road with no place to stay, we were giving immediate priority. To top it off, the repair bill came out to roughly half of what the estimation would be at another chain shop in the San Diego area.

Their service, pricing, and air conditioning are all 10/10. If you're in the area and in need of an emergency repair, this your best bet.< /text>< userid>

<Review>My 2008 Chrysler 300 caught on fire due to a wrench in the trunk coming in contact with the positive battery terminal and the body of the car. This caused an electrical fire that melted the entire fuse box and battery that was located in the trunk. I purchased a new harness containing about a hundred wires that leads from the trunk to the front of the car at a junkyard. I knew connecting it was going to be the automotive equivalent to spinal cord surgery.  Lee was amazing in that he was able to connect all of those wires to their corresponding mating wires and install the new fuse box and battery. This community is so lucky to have talented people like the mechanics at Miller Brothers to work on their cars. If you are a tourist, rest assured your car is in good hands should you need any repairs while here on the mountain. Thanks again Miller Brothers!

New Great Job Complete!!! 12/12/19

I just picked up my Chrysler after having a new starter installed and an oil change. The outstanding mechanical ability of the staff shined in their work yet again. I also learned something new about my recently purchased car. When I provided the Mobile1 oil, I provided 2 quarts too few. I was inder the mistaken impression, due to some bad internet information, that the capacity was 4.5 quarts. My initial confusion must have sounded like disbelief because I cause a very regrettable interaction with the office staff. It was my fault and I apologised several times for my error but the responding tonality never turned nice again. "I'm sincerely sorry for failing to communicate better"

In the future I plan to discuss any questions I have directly with the great guys in the garage and only go inside to pay to avoid a possible repeat. Still, one of the most trusted and the fairest priced auto shop around. Thanks again to the entire staff!<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>While camping near Yosemite, our alternator went out on our Toyota.  We are so thankful that Miller Brothers was not far from our campground.  We drove over and had them check out our Toyota where they confirmed that it was the alternator.  They ordered the part and said to come back in the morning.  The whole fix was done in an hour and the price was reasonable.  We drove through a lot of "middle of nowhere" to get to Yosemite from Las Vegas and we are so happy the alternator decided to die in this small town with a great mechanic!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x8090d55d24d3b1f1:0x8e514f8f38c3cf3e< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I called for a tow as my car was stuck in the mud/snow in my long driveway and being old with a bad back, I couldn't get it out.  I had just bought chains the night before but was unable to install them.  AAA said they would be here in about 90 minutes - it had been snowing for a few days and I'm sure he was very busy.  He was there within 45 min. and as all the reviews state, he was personable, professional and went the extra mile to make sure I was safe and my chains were installed correctly and got the car out of my driveway.  Even volunteered to walk me back to the house - a long distance - in the snow so I wouldn't fall.  Will definitely take my car to them for any problems.<//text>

I retired from the automotive business. It's a tough way to make a living.  People never come to your shop because they really want to or because it's fun.  They always have a problem and they know it's going to cost money $$$$.  It's rare to find honest, truthful and fair people in this business.  Dawn, Lee and Les are all great.  They have gone out of the way to make every experience tolerable and reasonable.  Can't ask for much more than that. I will recommend them to everyone I know.< /text>

WOW!!! These guys & gals are THE BEST!!

From Los Angeles, myself and 2 other girls were packed up and set to leave our campground that was about 30 miles away from Groveland, ON THE 4th of JULY. I started my heavily packed car and it sounds awful and would barely go until it died and wouldn't start again; I had JUST had it serviced a few days before the trip up to Yosemite. We hiked a mile to Evergreen Lodge who were kind and generous enough to let us use their computers and call a tow truck. We found Miller Brothers and called and explained the situation AND found out they are contracted with AAA. Within an hour Josh came and picked us up @ the comfy lodge, took all 3 of us back to the campground, loaded up the car and gave me great comfort the whole ride to the shop that all would be fine. They all made us feel like we were more like family than complete strangers. They gave us a diagnosis of a defective part, the brand new timing belt and let us know how long it would take, which unfortunately for us, fortunate for them, they had so many other cars to fix that it couldn't be fixed before the following week. They were SO honest and helpful; many small town shops I've dealt with in the past would have totally taken advantage of 3 destitute women and tried to rip them off. Not them...they're reputation around town as we explored Groveland was impeccable. Josh even took us into town to find a motel to crash at for the night. While we ate dinner and celebrated the holiday as best we could, we were assured by all the locals that my car was in good hands. I can't thank the mechanic Lee, his wife and cohort, Brittany...all of them actually, enough for their help and honesty for a smooth car trouble experience. It couldn't have been any better!!<//text>

Saved my yosemite trip -- I was expecting a ruined and expensive weekend had neither.    Fast, nice, and fair.  Charged only $70 labor to replace my alternator -- including sending a driver to Sonora (40 min. each way) and back to get the part, welding a broken bracket.    I was on the road before 1pm.<//text>

<Review>I called AAA to have my son's car towed back to Palo Alto. While the driver was nice, the lady manager for tonite was a real piece of work. She didnt listen, she was rude and started freaking out when my kid didnt have his AAA card handy..  So rules being rules, they refused to tow the car..
i might be old fashion, but courtesy and manners never goes out of style.. Yelling never solved anything.. thanks lady.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x8090d55d24d3b1f1:0x8e514f8f38c3cf3e< /Gmap_id><UserId.>105664562580461260871< /UserId.><date>1496038203630</date></record>

< Review>
Very unhonest people. Don't even think to rent U-Haul from them. First, they will promise you truck but at time when you ready to pick it up, they have only van available. Second, they will give you a van with half empty tank (slightly more may be). I have returned mine in less than 24 hours, filled it with 3.5 gallons of gasoline, ran 28 miles. They have charged me with late hours fees, 6 gallons of gasoline (28/6 = 4.66 miles per gallon, really? And keep in mind - I refilled it)... Those kind of places should be out of business for sure!</Review>

I get my oil changes here and much more. Eddie the owner, is a really nice and humble guy. I recommend you bring your car here. They also have a auto technician school there for anyone looking forward to becoming a Certified Auto Technician.<//text>

<text>Took my vehicle in for diagnosis. Edgar said catalytic converter was shot. Checked on repair cost at muffler shop. To expensive! Asked Edgar if he knew anyone that might buy the vehicle.  Edgar himself bought it on 01/20/21. BUT he has not registered it in his name.  Now I've recieved several toll violations. I will never go there again. Bad business practices. Fast Eddie, quick to take ur money...<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

This car wash is hidden behind Velero gas station. Never even knew they there. But, my car needed a wash and treatment of some kind. I have to say they did an excellent job. My car looked amazing, it smelled fresh and so clean. The price is normal pricing of any other car wash station. I like that this car wash has games, massage chairs and a TV. You won’t get bored waiting for your car to get done. Customer service was awesome, the manager gave me extra dollars for massage chairs for free!!!< /review>

<Review>This is a great coffee shop! It doesn't matter if it is breakfast, lunch or dinner. The food was always made fresh. It was delicious. The coffee was great and the juices were refreshing. There are options for people with all sorts of dietary needs so you don't have to worry. The whole family will find something great to eat and drinks there. The staff are also quite friendly. A must visit!</Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

$8.99 = 14 any donut, $3.29 = package of crm chz, $5.49 = 6 any bagel. They also have yummy bagel sandwiches and freshly made delicious and crispy glazed donuts as well. The drip coffee is affordable and good too, all at a convenient location. The staff are mostly helpful and friendly, and the price is definitely right here. I also like the quick turnover time between deciding on a sale and actually checking out with your yummy food. I always stop here on the way to work.< /review>

<Review>Every Friday I treat myself to Winchells because it’s my favorite breakfast joint/ chain. I try not to eat out for breakfast often because what I order tends to be unhealthy and kind of expensive but I love treating myself at Winchells. A sausage egg and cheese breakfast sandwich and a Chocolate Chilla and I am ready to get my Friday started! They also have the best donuts!!!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

This place has to know what they are doing when they make a damn good old fashion donut/buttermilk bar. Crispy outside and soft cakey but fluffy inside. There only one other donut shop I know that makes it the same but I won't talk about that .</text>

<Review>Amazing selection of donuts. So many choices it can be hard to decide on which ones you want in your choice of a dozen. The clerk was extremely friendly and patient for being in LA. I will make it a regular place to go on every future vacation. Highly recommend going to this place. You get way more than donuts. You can get sandwiches for all meals (breakfast, lunch, supper). Lots of drink choices as well.</Review><rate>5<//rate><resp>None< /resp></record>

they don't have avocados for the wrap but they charge for the avocado in the price, I asked for extra meat or something to substitute the avocado but then they charge extra.... so when they don't have a main ingredient they don't subtract from the price but charge extra for other things.</Text>

I love the customer service here the ladies here are friendly courteous, and very helpful.  It gets really busy here and they still serve you right. You'll be addicted to their combo special so much you'll have to skip a few days in the week from going here. Black forest ham on croissant my fave and my co-workers. Da bomb!!!!!!</review>

The lady works there messed up our order, then when we asked her if she can fix it she got mad at us as if it was our fault. We didn't complain or anything so I dont understand why she got mad at us.< /Review>

Also offers coffee, cappucino etc

<review>Very welcoming and friendly environment. Friday khutbah (sermon) in winter starts at 1 PM, and prayer starts at 1:45 PM.
Found the speaker Brother Hussam quite progressive and accommodating.
Parking space is limited so you may have to park on adjacent streets.<//review>< pictures>

< Review>
Oakdale Kids is absolutely Fantastic! I was so incredibly grateful to have such a wonderful office to take my kids to. My son is six & used to hate going to the dentist , but everything is different with Oakdale Kids. The kids get to sit & watch tv while they get their x-rays, teeth cleaning, & a dental examination. Hands down the best dental office. Thank you Dr. C for being so incredibly amazing with kids. We will see you soon!</Review>

<text>The people that work there are really polite and helpful. We are treated great from the registry till the time of getting a check up. Also, Dr Gurneet Chahal is a great dentist with children, she was nice with my three children when they had to go for their appointment. Overall a great place.</text>< Pictures>

This place is awesome!! It's a super clean environment. The lady at the desk was super nice and signing up for the first time was a breeze! The assistants were both so understanding of my daughters fear of the dentist and didn't pressure for anything that wasn't necessary.
Dr. Gurneet Chahal recommended a
fluoride free toothpaste for my two year old daughter, which made the experience even better  because you know she's not out here prescribing toxins for children, she genuinely wants what's best for them! They made us feel super comfortable and welcomed! 5 stars all around!!<//review>

<review>I would whole heartily recommend anyone to bring their children here! The ladies here are incredible when it comes to understanding. The Dr. is so helpful when it comes to explaining to the children so they are not afraid. I have a son who is autistic and they walked him through it all and reassured him everything would be fine. My daughter had a baby tooth that needed to come out and they did it better than any other doctor, I’ve ever been to! Thank you Dr. and staff, for understanding these are children and doing such a great job!!</review>< Response>

If you have kids who are afraid of to go to the dentist I would recommend you bring them to Dr. Gurneet Chahal. We have two kids with autism who freak out going to the dentist. She was able to calm them and reassure them that this was a safe environment. My daughter, who was freaking out the most allowed Dr. Chahal to take x rays and polish her teeth. She has a magic touch with kids.< /text>

First time visit for my 3 girls & as new patients it was a great experience! Since we were new we had a bit of trouble finding the location but almost 5 minutes past our appointment the receptionist followed up with a call to check if we were going to make it which was great goes to show that she is keeping good track of the scheduling & follow ups on missed/no show appointments! Almost immediately after speaking to her she guided us to their location. Filled out COVID screening forms & took my kids on back so that they were taken care of in a “timely” manner since we were already late on our end. Good time management on there end. While in the establishment it was very fresh and clean in there! All the girls & treating dentist were awesome & very patient w/ my girls ages 2-9. Almost immediately after they were done with there check up while scheduling follow up appointments I seen one of the techs disenfecting the seats which was a HUGE plus goes to show they are taking all pre cautions and sanitary measures to keep everyone safe 🙂 even though it’s protocol to clean soon after patient has completed their visit you would be surprised by the amount of offices that don’t do that! I highly recommend 👍 I don’t often post reviews but I’ll make any effort to put one where it’s deserved 😉Good Job ladies!< /review>

Always a pleasant visit. Everyone is very friendly and great with the little ones. Our girls are very happy with their Dentist and don't get anxious to go to the dentist like before. The dental assistants are very accommodating to all your children's needs. I would highly recommend Oakdale kids dentist.</Review>

<Review>They always make sure my daughter feels safe and comfortable and if for some reason she is not having it that day, they will schedule an appointment for her to come back on a day that's better for her. They are always nice, polite, and understanding as well. I trust my kid in the work of their hands.</Review>< Pics>

Dr.Chahal  is very  kind and patient with the kids. We now take both our daughters here and are very satisfied with the customer service. Before coming here my daughter would have panic attacks because she was so scared of the dentist. Now she smiles and gives the dentist huge hugs and thanks her.</text>

Have always taken both my boys here and never had a bad experience! The dentist is always nice and knows how to work with kids af all ages. Makes the kids feel safe and never wants to do unnecessary work. I highly recommend.<//Text>

<text>This is by far the best kids dental practice I have taken my kids too. I'm always nervous when it comes to kids and dentist, but this dentist was the nicest person that I have ever met.
Both my children were very comfortable in getting treated by her, the staff is very professional and the clinic decor is to make the children comfortable. Highly affordable and they provide convenient after school hours so I do not have to take a day off.
I'm getting braces for both my children next month, because of their great deal on Orthodontic treatment.

Highly highly recommended.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<review>I started taking my kids to this dental office last year. Every visit I have to wait at least an hour past my appointment to be seen. The final straw with me was that I brought my two kids in for a cleaning. I was there for over an hour for X-rays and then they spent not even 5 minutes cleaning my kids teeth, did not show me the xrays nor did they tell me that my son had a second tooth growing behind one of his adult teeth. A couple days after his cleaning he noticed tooth breaking through. I called the dentist office right away and I was informed the doctor would not call me to discuss this but that I could schedule and emergency appointment.... so I decided it was time
To take my kids elsewhere. I called for the records and they took the info and didn’t send them over. I called again and they want to charge me $18 to send my records over when I am only leaving because of the service I received. I was upset that they wanted to charge this fee to send over electronic records, they said they would have the doctor call me about the fee...the same doctor I was told doesn’t make calls...I was told 6 days ago that the doctor would call me and I have still yet to get a phone call, I still don’t have my records sent over either.  DON’T GO TO THIS OFFICE if you want any form of customer service at all.</review></record>

After looking for a while and changing dentists a few time. We received a flyer in the mail for Oakdale kids dentist. On a random whim we gave it a try. And now, 3 years later are still as happy as we where when we found them. The staff are all fantastic. I couldn't think of going anywhere else.</Text>

I recently switched my kids over to their office and I was so impressed the moment I walked in. The whole environment is very kid friendly and fun! I took my daughter in for follow up treatment and she was very nervous walking in. The doctor did her treatment in a very timely manner and she did not even flinch. We are very please with the staff and the overal experience!</review>

< Review>
Receptionist made things very difficult, and complicated... Asked for I'd and wouldn't accept it because it was expired,  then showed them a valid ID but wouldn't accept my kids because I didn't have there insurance cards.... But she types in there social security # and said ( ok yea I see here that they have insurance) I said okay so why can't they be seen she said because no insurance card,, every other place I was been my kids were always seen without insurance card they just look em up and see that they have valid insurance,b not here... And then they said they're open till 5 o'clock I got here at  4:15 an this place was empty locked up nobody here... So I don't know why time they close but it's not 5</Review>

Traumatized our 6 year old. They recommended filling a cavity on a baby tooth, but another dentist said it was not a problem at all. Doctor was late to our early AM appointment and far too stern to work with children.<//review>

< review>
My child has his orthodontic work here and let me first state that the Orthodontist is kind and I have no concerns with him specifically.   I want to warn others about the service I have experienced and maybe they can avoid.  I thought that by getting my son his orthodontic work here in Oakdale would be easier than travelling to another city.. worst mistake I could've made regarding his orthodontic care.  Proximity is not as important as the care he receives.  If starts by the greeting when you walk in the door by the (I assume) office manager. She is so rude and doesn't even awknowlege you when you walk it, but rather continue looking at whatever's on the desk or computer and then rudely command, "Have a seat." Then if you don't sit in that very moment, she again (in a louder, more rude way) states, "HAVE A SEAT." Every. Single.  Time. We come in, they are "out of wires".. I don't get this because isn't that your business?! Wires?!  There seems to be no one with experience because it seems as if my son gets jabbed in the gums at every visit.  I regret signing a contract for his care here and I cannot wait for him to be done.  I am so disappointed with this office and their business practices.  Once my son's done, we will never go back.</review>

After one visit with Dr. Chahal- the 45 minute drive for us is one we will continue to make just to get the wonderful care we received at this location.

Thank you all for taking the extra time, and outstanding patience to care so lovingly for my child. The Karr family is so appreciative!

Waited 30 min in the room and not one person came to turn on the TV or anything for my son. Doctor had a rough tone in her voice and appeared aggravated because my 5 year old kept closing his mouth when she was in there with her ultrasonic scaler or whatever it was.</Review>

<rating>5</rating><text>Dr. Tebbe is the best Chiropractor I have ever been to. Spine adjustments are just one small part of what he does. The releases he's done on my fascia and joints have been life changing. So much tension and stiffness have left my body, it now feels enjoyable to be in my body and I have noticeably more energy. On top of all this he cares deeply about his patients; it's very evident from the time and care he takes with you at each appointment. I can't recommend him enough, I feel very lucky I found him. He has greatly improved my health and well being.<//text>< Pictures>

<review>Dr. Michael is the best chiropractor I know! I was a little bit afraid to go for the first time after my bad experiencewith other chiropractor couple of years ago but I was pleasantly surprised how different he is. Michael is very gentle, kind, friendly and really knows what he is doing. He really helped me with my compressed left side of the body, left shoulder and my back. After the session you will feel that you are ready to fly! Now I send everyone I know only to him. Thank you Dr. Michael! 🙏< /review>< name>

My experience at bright start chiropractic with Dr. Michael Tebbe has been nothing but the best! Before I came to doctor Tebbe I’ve had a bad posture for all my life and on my consultation day I told Dr. Tebbe that my bad posture was a major concern for my self-assurance, and he immediately recognized the problem. He recommended these video exercises to do everyday, so I pushed myself to do these exercises, and after a few therapy sessions, I noticed a change in my posture and the way I walk, thanks to doctor Tebbe and his amazing work, I've been feeling more comfortable with myself. I would highly recommend anyone to visit Dr. Michel Tebbe at Bright Start Chiropractic.< /Text>

<review>Michael has been my go-to for keeping my body in alignment and pain-free doing the activities I love. He has a wealth of knowledge - in addition to efficiently resolving any problems I am experiencing, I learn something new about the connections in the body each time I go in. I've gained many tools, tips, and tricks I am now using to my advantage at home. Highly recommend!< /review>< Pictures>

I've been taking my son to Dr Tebbe ever since he was 6 months old. He's incredibly caring, attentive, and works great with the little ones. When my son turned 1.5-2 years old and was starting to fearlessly climb things, falling, and just doing all the crazy things that give you a mini heart attack as a parent - I felt so thankful that I could bring him to Dr Tebbe and get him checked out, adjusted, and prepped for his next stunt. I also see him myself for neck and low back issues that come up time to time and he always knows how to get things working great.<//review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>I highly recommend Dr. Tebbe. Going to a chiropractor within the first few weeks of being a new mom with a brand new baby could have been stressful, but instead he made us feel at ease with his presence, knowledge and magic touch. Our baby was comfortable in his arms, which allowed him to get in and massage and adjust his head & neck from being in the breech position. He helped our baby and also us! Thank you, Dr. Tebbe!<//review><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1610480637229, 'text': 'Thank you Maggie.

<Text>Dr. Tebbe is a phenomenal chiropractor! I suffered a fall in our home when I was 35 weeks pregnant with a 2 year old and the adjustment he gave me not only led to my speedy recovery but the visit was short and gentle enough that my son stayed quietly and patient in the room! Thank you Dr. Tebbe! It helped out so much that I had to return post partum- it helped alot!!!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

I have been getting adjustments with Dr Tebbe for several years. Although I have recently moved from the state whenever I return I do my best to schedule and adjustment. Each adjustment feels almost customized to what my body needs at the time. I leave feeling lighter and relaxed. I highly recommend his services.< /Review>

<review>I went to see Dr. Tebbe when I was pregnant and it helped me a lot. I felt stiffness in my back, my hips hurt and I had swollen feet. He would adjust my angle, back and hip and teach me a couple exercises on how to make life easier with that big belly. It helped me a lot. I ended up delivering all natural (no medication, co c-section). Thanks Dr. Tebbe!</review>< Resp>

Dr Tebbe is absolutely wonderful!  I have been seeing him for many years, and at one point in time, was driving back down to LA from Mammoth Lakes for my adjustment.  He is kind, gentle, and truly works on the body a whole.  He was tremendous support following a recent abdominal surgery and subsequent abdominal muscle hematoma, guiding my body through recovery smoothy and getting me fully functional.

As a nurse with a excessive physical demand on my feet, back, and neck, my visits with Dr Tebbe are my own opportunity to receive healing, and to recover prior to the next week.  He even heals the healers 😉.

I truly can’t recommend him and his generous skill set more highly!<//review>

I’ve been to a handful of chiropractors and physical therapists to treat my back and neck pain, and Dr. Teppe is definitely the best, most effective chiropractor I’ve seen! He’s kind, extremely knowledgable, attentive, and genuinely cares about his patients. His adjustments are gentle yet powerful, as I always leave feeling instant relief and stronger. He also records various useful informative YouTube videos about the body and brain, as well as demonstrative videos of stretching routines and mobility exercises—again, demonstrating his genuine care. Check out his videos, they really do help. After just a few visits, I’ve seen such an improvement with my back and neck pain, as well as my mobility and posture. Dr. Teppe really knows his stuff, and I sincerely encourage seeing him—you and your body will be grateful!!</review>

Dr. Tebbe is an outstanding  Chiropractic Doctor. I’ve received chiropractic  treatment from numerous Chiropractors
For many years, and Dr. Tebbe is the best practitioner that I’ve experienced.
He is sensitive and gentle in his approach. Dr. Tebbe has a profound understanding of the human body
And movement, which he has integrated into his own authentic method of treatment.

My treatment at the chiropractors office happened during the covid quarantine. Office stuff was always friendly and did everything to ensure the safety of their patients.

I came to Dr.Tebbe’s with a back and a neck pain after a car accident upon a recommendation. I am satisfied with results and will recommend DR. Tebbe to a friend.

Besides that he is attentive and pleasant to deal with he has a lot of knowledge in his field.
He significantly helped with my pain, and gave me tools and exercise that I am still continue doing on my own.< /Text>

Michael is by far the best Chiropractor I’ve been to. I walked out if his office after my first visit feeling like a new person. He’s not only assisted in the healing of a 2 years of neck pain, but also with symptoms similar to that of Vertigo. He’s compassionate, gentle and speaks to you in a language that makes one safe and in good hands.</text>

Dr. Mike is an expert at his craft. I was referred to him for a more holistic approach to my overall healing journey. With the sweetest bed side manner and his skillful talent, he was able to identify the parts of my body that needed specific attention. Even when I am not able to articulate where in my body I feel out of whack, he is keen to find the problem areas. Plus, he is fluent in Spanish, which makes me feel extra comfortable. Overall, Dr. Mike is a hidden gem on the Westside. I fully recommend his Chiropractic practice. Your body will be grateful! :)</text>

"Hands down" the best Chiropractor I have ever been too, and I've been to quite a few. Michael took the time to look at my whole body and find tightness in places that I wasn't even aware of. After only 2 session he took care of issues that had been lingering for many months, and I walked taller and healthier than in a long time!<//Text>

Dr. Tebbe knows his stuff. After a friend recommended him, I went in with some pretty debilitating pain in my neck and down my shoulder that wasn’t going away. Within 45 minutes Dr. Tebbe had made adjustments that decreased my pain and increased my mobility by 50% practically instantly, putting me well on the way to healing in full.</Review>

It was my first experience with a chiropractor so I was not sure what to expect. I had been experiencing numbness and tingling throughout my left arm for about 9 months and had been to a number of other professionals throughout that time and no one was 100% sure what the cause was as they could only give guesses. During those months, I was experiencing some level of pain every single day. During our first session, Michael was able to pinpoint the various joints and locations in my body that were causing the pain and numbness. After 5 sessions, my numbness subsided and I felt an ease and comfort throughout my body that I had not felt for several months. His expertise and holistic approach significantly changed my day to day life. I strongly recommend him!<//review>< pictures>

Dr. Tebbe is amazing! He’s very friendly and truly has his patient’s best interests at heart. I brought my 3 month old baby to him twice to help her after she had her lip and tongue tie revised.

<review>I have a mild heartburn/bloating issue (lab results came out normal), so I decided to go see Dr. Tebbe. My posture is quite terrible, so 2 birds 1 stone.

Dr. Tebbe patiently spent time examining and explaining what could be the root of the problem in my body and did a session of realignment, which was an instant bliss.

For those who are curious about body alignment, I’d definitely encourage seeing Dr. Michael Tebbe. The man did wonders.< /review>< pics>

Before I went to see Dr. Michael ("Mikey") I look like the photo attached.  Now I just look like a normal gumby - loose and aligned.  Dr. Michael always sees what's off, and he even has an instrument that eliminates the dreaded neck cracking move.  Gotta love that!  Thanks, Mikey!<//review>

I had severe neck pain and Michael worked wonders with my neck and back. Within 3 days I had full range of motion in my neck and zero pain. Truly a game changing experience.

My experience with Dr. Tebbe has been amazing! I am so grateful to him for helping relieve the pain in my neck that I had been dealing with for YEARS! I've seen other chiropractors throughout the years and was surprised by the various techniques he used that I had never seen before. Needless to say, his techniques helped to relieve the pain I had been dealing with for so long. He really is an expert in his field and I highly recommend him!

Thank you Dr. Tebbe for making my days pain free and more enjoyable!</Review>

I have worked with many chiropractors over the years for my injuries byt Michael Tebbe is the best.  I have had issues with my back and right shoulder and not only did he align my back and fix my arm, he gave me insight into things I can do to prevent the pain from happening again.  Being able to walk better and use my arm more than ever is crazy and I'm so appreciative.  Thank you.</review>

I have chronic back and neck pain and Dr Tebbe has been a lifesaver!! His treatments allow me to do my work without pain and without taking medications. He is truly one of the best chiropractors I have seen. He is also so flexible with my schedule which is beyond helpful. I can not express how grateful I am to have found him.</text>

<review>Amazing - a thoughtful and honest approach.

I have had lower back pain for 8 years and have had advice from a variety of leading industry ‘experts’ who could never seem to help, with the last suggesting surgery.

I was recommended Dr. Tebbe and after first session it was obvious that his unique approach and methodical analysis was going to help. After a few sessions my back pain has subsided and the relief is absolutely amazing.

I would recommend Dr. Tebbe to those of all ages and to those with pain but also those who are looking for preventative treatment.

Thank you, Doctor!

<review>Dr. Tebbe has helped me with neck and back pain for the last eight years.

I get aches from my job as a hygienist, and also from my physical activities like hiking and working out.  Sometimes it’s just a twinge here and there, and other times, it’s a full-blown issue that affects my participation in my activities.

Dr. Tebbe works intuitively, feeling for tension and lack of movement, and keenly observing where my body is out of alignment and lacking proper posture.  Each adjustment is different based on how I present that day.  And I get homework, usually in the form of instruction supplemented by online videos for me to refer to (which helps a lot!), so I can stay on top of my care at home.

I’m really grateful for the care and attention I get from Dr. Tebbe that allows me to enjoy my job and my leisure activities.<//review>< resp>

Dr Tebbe is the rare chiropractor who can work with very young children as well as middle aged person like me. As an occasional jogger I rely on him to keep me pain free. I am a software consultant and I tend to sit in my car or at my computer desks a lot.

Dr.,Tebbe uses both analytical tools and his ability to handle adjustments via very gentle touches.

I used to take pain medications before I met him. Today I keep a regular monthly schedule with him and I am happy to say I feel healthy and I am pain free.

I have been a patient for over 6 years and I am still grateful to him for my pain free health. He is an amazingly gifted doctor< /text>

Dr. Tebbe might just be the best chiropractor in West LA.  I went to see him for lower back issues after several sessions with another chiro did nothing.  Dr. Tebbe  quickly identified the problem and took a more holistic approach.  My discomfort was almost completely resolved in 4-5 sessions.<//review>

< review>
Over the last several months of 2017 I was dealing with lower back, leg and hip pain. Things came to a head in January of 2018 when after a trip to Disneyland I was in considerable pain and within a couple of day after my trip I was barely able to walk or stand.

After allowing myself a moment to heal up I was referred to Dr. Tebbe by a family member. I made an appointment with him and saw him a few days later. Dr. Tebbe asked me a series of questions to get an idea of my activity and what I was doing leading up to my last major incident. He then proceeded to do a thorough examination and began to determine what my issues were. Ultimately he figured out a major part of my issue was that my right hip was out of alignment. Dr. Tebbe re-adjusted my hip and suddenly I started to feel like normal again. He also offered recommendations for managing this issue.

After my visit with Dr. Tebbe I am able to walk longer distances and have a more normal active life. Prior to seeing Dr. Tebbe I was limited in distance and mobility and dealing with pain and discomfort on a regular basis. With continued treatment from Dr. Tebbe I am able to have a higher quality of life that I honestly thought I had lost for good.

Thank you Dr. Tebbe for all that you do and in helping me be at my physical best!</review>

I sit for extended hours driving to work and then at work and started to have some chronic lower back pain.  I have seen Dr. Tebbe several times and always feel way better after his adjustments.  I went to one other chiropractor before meeting Dr. Tebbe and would now only go to Dr. Tebbe.  He is great at what he does and always has super helpful tips for preventative care as well.  I highly recommend Dr. Tebbe.</text>

<review>Two years ago while we were visiting our son in LA, he insisted we see Dr. Tebbe for back issues.  After just two visits, our backs were feeling so much better, no pain while sitting, standing or walking.  When we returned this past February to LA, we scheduled numerous appointments with Dr. Tebbe to work on our backs, as well as, my husband’s leg and foot.  He has had two hip/knee replacements and was hunched over walking from poor alignment of the back, leg and foot.  With Dr. Tebbe’s expertise, he was able to straighten the left knee so that it would lie flat.  The foot and ankle were out of alignment and with just a few adjustments, his toes now have space and do not curl downward.  He has had pooling of blood in his ankle since surgery on the left leg.  After Dr. Tebbe’s adjustments, there is no visible blood in the ankle area and circulation has improved. He is walking straighter and has no discomfort.
I was having nerve tingling in my right foot and limited range of motion in my right shoulder with pain.  After several adjustments to my back, the pinched sciatic nerve is no longer causing tingling in my toes.  My range of motion has improved in my shoulder.
We just wish that we could visit him on a regular basis, as it benefits us greatly!  Living in Maryland prevents us from doing so and we can’t find anyone in our area that uses the same techniques.  We’ll see you the next time we are in LA Dr. Tebbe!
Thank you.

<review>Tebbe is truly the best chiropractor I have ever been to! He listens to your needs and focuses where it's needed most.

I first went in because of chronic back pain (L5/S1 herniated disk). I had daily pain for over 2 years and been to several chiropractors. After visiting Tebbe for about 2 months the pain is gone... GONE.

I'm back to the active life style I had before my injury and I couldn't be more grateful!</review><Rating>5< /Rating>< Gmap_id>

<review>Dr. Tebbe has done wonders with my family. A few months ago I was pregnant and I had sciatica so bad I wasn't able to walk properly.  After a couple of visits to Dr. Tebbe I was up and moving again. He also help me with my pelvis in order to make more space  for the baby and have a nice and smooth delivery. My baby girl was born on November and it was a  fast and easy delivery (all natural).
Now that  the baby is born we have taken her to see Dr. Tebbe since she seems to lean her head towards one side and be very fuzzy. Tebbe advised us she had left Torticollis and after a couple of visits she is doing so much better. She is not as fuzzy, her sucking reflexes  are better and she is more alert (her head moves to both sides now 😊). To any mommy to be out there I recommend to see Dr. Tebbe!

<text>I'm happy that my friend referred Dr. Tebbe to me. I come from the other side of town to see him. I was experiencing numbness down one of my legs and it was starting to cause discomfort. It was distracting me from concentrating at work and living life.

Dr. Tebbe took an evaluation of me and created a course of treatment. He also showed me some exercises that I could do at home that would strengthen certain areas for my back. After I finished treatment, the numbness went away and I was feeling so much better! The numbness never returned and it's been over two years now.

I like how Dr. Tebbe has a broad knowledge of exercises and chiropractic methods to address your issues. He is extremely skillful and thoughtful.

I continue to see him once a month for regular maintenance and I always feel so good afterwards. It's worth it for me to make that extra effort to go all the way across town because he's that good!</text>< rating>

Dr. Tebbe is hands down the best chiropractor I have ever had work on my body. As an athlete in the actions sports arena and former motocross racer I have plenty of damage to my body. While I have seen chiro's for over a decade or more and received 100' if not 1000's of adjustments, no one has been able to help my body recover and maintain proper alignment like Dr. Tebbe. His maticulous attention to detail while adjusting the body has proved to be some of the fastest healing I have ever experienced from injury.<//review>

<username>Ajax Scribe<//username><text>Michael Tebbe is a very thorough chiropractor that has a "sixth sense" for finding what's out of alignment on your body. Extremely sensitive to your needs, he goes above & beyond by giving you tips on how to have better posture throughout your day. Since working with Dr.Tebbe, my chronic shoulder and Lowe back pain has disappeared, I have lost over 35 lbs, and I contribute better posture to my ability to work harder at the gym without aches & pains, as well as a renewed focus on a healthier diet. I can't recommend him enough! A.J. Marchisello</text>< response>

Had the pleasure of getting this beauty removed from my old tire before deciding to go ahead and get two new ones put in. Had me in and out within 30 minutes. And this was as a walk in, on a Sunday. Thank you so much! The team was polite, quick, and cost efficient. I will definitely be back when the time comes.< /Text>

My tire had a nail stuck and almost got ripped off by Firestone located on W Florida where they didn’t do their job.. they claimed my tire wasn’t patchable and they didn’t even take off the tire to actually look at it and was about to order me a tire without asking me if I wanted to go that direction. Luckily, this location had great customer service and were honest and reliable which felt great. They said my tire was completely fine & patchable instead of lying to me like Firestone did. THANK YOU, Desert Tires. You guys earned a customer!</Text>

Justin was able to get me a good deal on some 285 toyos with the method n305s. I showed up late ( my fault) and as I was paying i noticed the bolt pattern was incorrect. Claudia and "Gerardo" (I believe) were frantically calling around to find my size. Method told them 2 weeks at best. Furtonetlythey found the pattern in my size to be here the following morning. Their steadfast devotion and hasty thinking made it possible to continue with the purchase. They even went out of there way to drop me off at home that same night. These guys are true professionals.

Usually great service. I have been going for years. Just recently I took my newly purchase vehicle and asked them to inspect my power steering system. They found that I needed an alignment and cam bolts(?). They proceeded to complete my repairs. Only for me to find out the very next day that my rack and pinion was busted. I couldn't drive for a week until I fixed it. They put the shoes on before the socks when the socks were necessary.</Text>

These folks were very courteous and got me in and out according to their sign in sheet. Had a bad gas cap but they took charge and changed it out at a minimal fee. Was in and out in less than an hour and that was with the registration of my mother's vehicle. Good job keep it up. Thank you.< /Text>

Got a used tire..2 weeks later it's showing metal all 3 of my tires I had prior look better then this one and when I called all they could say is it sound like alignment issue?  Every other used tire I've gotten from other places honor the bad tires I give allot of business but guess they'd rather lose a customer with bad service. They are no good don't go there<//Text>

*** DO NOT COME HERE*** this place is a scam. They don't fix your alignment. They gave me my reciept and sent me on my way without them telling me my car can't be aligned. I found out when I went to sears for new tires  a few days later that they didn't do the job. I took it back and they said my alignment couldnt be looked at unless  I fixed some parts. He never told me that. I asked him why did he charge me if it couldn't be aligned. His words " because no one works for free" sad and pathetic this place. He charged me $60 and wrote $40 on my reciept so he pocketed some money obviously. Always ask for a before and after printout for your alignment. Sears does it and other places. Waste of money here with a bunch of crooks.<//Text>

< review>
I was told they had my tires new and in stock and I let them know I'm coming in. After I get to the inside of their filthy office they inform me they are out of stock. This place will lie to you to get you in the door and try to sell u used.

waste of time don't bother< /review>

It's super-duper crowded, especially during peak hours & holiday shopping. They could do w/ improvements on parking. But it's convenient, & ppl/employees are knowledgeable & helpful...mostly. :) I'll be back.< /Review>

Xmas shopping galore all in one easy location! Convenient, plenty of parking and "real" friendly salespeople to help you, no big box stores here.< /Review>

Great place to shop!  Love the holiday cheer of festive lights, and holiday music every year - gets me in the gift giving spirit.  Something lacking in the other shopping centers.  Also, the customer service is excellent at most of the establishments located here.<//review>

<text>The Wall of China restaurant was yummy! Great food. The staff was very sweet and super helpful explaining the different dishes.
We were very impressed with our service. Huge portions! Next time we're in the area and wanting Chinese food we'll definitely be coming back. Prices were reasonable for what you received.<//text>< pics>

I actually visited the cigarette store and the Dollar Tree and I enjoyed both experiences cigarette store has such a variety of whatever you need from vaping too much jewelry and their prices are fair and that helped us friendly and they stay open late I like that they stay open till 9 then I went to the Dollar Tree and they had such a variety of things that was amazing and it was only a dollar not 99 Cents Store and More it was the Dollar Tree everything was $1 and I got a righty of nail polishes and dog treats all kinds of stuff so I would highly recommend it staff there usually it is pretty decent and they're fast and efficient definitely recommend both places</Text>

It's a nice shopping center... with the exception of the dress store, I think they need to put some kind of entertainment for kids there... This place has nothing for kids to do, especially for birthdays, they have the option between two different parks, they need a chuck e cheese or The Jungle or even the trampoline place...</Text>

This shopping center has Price Co, Dollar Tree, Round Table, CVS, Jack in the Box, Kohl's, American Footwear, Columbia Candy Kitchen, Mountain Bookstore, KFC, Starbucks, TJ Maxx and several other stores I can't remember off the top of my head. Lots of stores though so you can most things here.</Text>

Convenient, although a target for vehicle crime. Be sure to lock up, someone tried to open my vehicle's door after I went into a store, but luckily it was locked.</text>

The stores are good and relevant, but the buildings are in need of maintenance and repair. The landscaping is always well kept, but there shrubs that block your view of vehicles coming through the center lane. You have to creep out to see if someone's coming.</text>

Close to Hwy 108 and Hess Ave, Got most things people need.  Taco Bell and Burger King across the street, five different places to eat in the center, varied type food, Starbucks.  Bank, grocery, CVS, Kohls, Dollar store and a few others.  Plenty of parking.< /Text>

The junction is a place I visit often. Price Co foods is a decently priced grocery store that is convenient as it is close to home. The cigarette store is in the far corner. Wells Fargo is my bank, located right next to Starbucks. Then of course CVS for medicine, all kinds of things I tend to need while I'm there & who doesn't need to stop in at the Dollar store? I do! Famous footwear wear, Kohl's & TJMaxx are also visited frequently. I would rather hit up the junction for my shopping needs as it is so much more convenient, faster & friendlier than a trip to Walmart. Doesn't matter if I only need 1 item on my way home or a whole list of things, the junction is the place I stop. The junction also has other stores I didn't mention like a jewelry store,Jack in the box, Togo's, subway, a place to get nails done BBVA bank & a few more<//Review>

A little bit of everything in one spot, just a few miles up the hill from downtown Sonora. Great place to make a stop for coffee, and grocerys if you're heading up the 108.<//review>

Jack in the Box, Starbucks, KFC, Kohl's, TJ Maxx, The Dollar Tree, Columbia Candy Kitchen, The Mountain Bookstore, Price Co and there's a Mexican food restaurant that I don't know the name of, Money Mart and a couple other places, I think there's a sandwich shop but I can't remember the rest. But some good stores for sure.</Review>
