<Review>We recently had our carpet and tile floors cleaned by Joe & Joe Jr.  A very professional job from start to finish.  Michelle keep us informed of their arrival time and provided us with quotes and final receipts in a timely fashion.  They were very careful in protecting our home from damage and made the process easy from beginning to end.  They made sure the job met are expectations.  You will have to move any furniture to prepare the area for cleaning.  Carpet looks great and our tile floors look like new after being installed 18 years ago.  Very pleased and will definitely use them in the future!!< /Review>< response>

< Review>
This was one of the best decisions I've ever made, I will only use Petrichor for all the cleaning services they offer.My very pleasant experience started with Michelle,I needed to have my carpet cleaned,it only got better.Joe and Jojoe were so professional and friendly by the time they finished with the cleaning my carpet looked like new.I've used many carpet cleaners in the 20 yrs.I've lived here,this is the only company I'll use in the future.
Thanks Michelle,Joe and Jojoe you're amazing.

<Review>I was recommended petrichor from a friend and after seeing their reviews, i immediately called to book an appointment. It was a month out but let me tell you, it was WORTH IT! I opted to get all the rooms cleaned, couches cleaned and area rug. Everything was immaculate! I wasn’t able to stay home while they cleaned since I had to be at work but they kept me updated with photos and videos of the process and locked up for me once they were done. I’m so appreciative of the exceptional customer service that I will be referring all my friends and family!< /Review><rating>5<//rating><pics>None< /pics><user_name>Rosana dominguez<//user_name>< time>

I'm a repeat customer because Joe takes pride in his work.  This company has a great reputation in our area and has been highly recommended repeatedly.  He's cleaned our tiles, carpet and upholstery, and I'm always pleased with the outcome.  The price is very reasonable too.  Thank you for being consistent with the quality of your work and making it easy for me to rely on your services.  See you next time! =)</review>

We are extremely pleased with Petrichor Carpet Cleaning. We used this wonderful business last June on our rental property and Joe did a beautiful job. He is very dedicated in making sure he does a professional and meticulous job. He is prompt, doesn't make or leave a mess and cares about the final result. We just  used his service yesterday on our primary residence and are elated of the final outcome he completed. We have a very light colored older carpet and he brighten up the entire look of this 30 year old  product. Joe's wife is very friendly and helpful in arranging for our service.  We wish that all businesses were as helpful, professional, dedicated and honest. We highly recommend Petrichor Carpet Cleaning. We will us them again next year and will use them to clean my mom's carpet next. Thank you!<//text>

<text>We used Petrichor Carpet Cleaning+ to clean our house in preparation to list our home on the market.

It was heavily soiled, both by foot traffic and by pets over the years. The end result was amazing! You could not tell that there was every any soil to begin with. We have had stains from hair color and purple slime and Joseph was able to remove everything.

I would highly recommend Petrichor to anyone looking to have their carpets/tile cleaned. They are very professional, affordable and the result was unbelievable.

We will be using them again.<//text>< userid>

Our carpets & area rugs are always left super clean, smelling great, and feel so soft. I highly recommend this company!< /Text>< pictures>

Petrichlor does an outstanding job of cleaning carpets & making them look new again all for a reasonable price. This is the second time we have had them clean our 9 year old carpets & they look fabulous. They even removed all black spots on the carpets. Their prices are very reasonable. They are efficient, professional, & reasonable. I will use their service again & highly recommend having them clean your carpets.< /review>

Michelle and Joe do an excellent job with every aspect.  Wonderful customer service.

This is my 2nd experience with Joe and Michelle - Petrichor Cleaning Systems.  We needed an urgent cleaning due to elderly dog issues.  They came out the next day and as usual did an excellent job.  Their services are superior.  This is the only company and business owners I will have in my home.< /Text>

Petrichor's is simply the best.  Apparently, the business name was changed to the current name.  Joe cleans my carpet every year.  I trust no other.  It's a class-act operation all the way around. Give 'em a call, and you'll see why.</text>

They are the example by which I wish every business operated under.  Clean, courteous, punctual, and obviously do excellent work. They give you a window of time when they will be there and are actually there! They are respectful of your home and go over all of the details of what you want before starting.  He puts guards against your walls so they don't get scratched and his equipment is clean when he brings it in. Our carpets always look excellent when he leaves and there is no soapy residue because he just uses steam.  This husband/ wife team does it all and they do it better than anyone around.

Hands down the BEST carpet cleaner I have used. Joe was very thorough and left my carpet in amazing condition. It's hard to rent a house and worry about expenses outside those every day costs.

I was nervous that my carpets couldn't possibly get cleaned.  With five kids and a 150 lb dog,  my floors see their fair share of abuse. But EcoPro came in and cleaned it all up! It felt so nice to know my carpets were clean, really clean. The appointment was easy to schedule,  Joe arrived exactly when he said he would,  and the work was phenomenal. Highly recommend!< /Text>

Joe has been cleaning our carpets for a couple of years now and each time he comes to our home it feels like new again. I have 5 dogs and with 5 dogs we get a couple of accidents every now and then . Last week our corgi had a major accident , we couldn’t even go in the room for too long or we’d start gagging . I messaged Michelle and she squeezed us in to their already busy schedule. Joe came as soon as he could , cleaned up the mess and had it smelling fresh in no time . If you want the job to be done we definitely  recommend eco Pro.<//Text>

<review>Joe's Eco-Pro - fantastic customer service skills & very professional!  They brought life back to my 20 year year old carpet.  Much better job than a previously hired company had done.<//review>< Rating>

<Text>I called Ecopro and got an appointment the next day for an upholstery cleaning which was overdue. Joe arrived ahead of time (even before I got home) and was prompt and explained what he was going to do! My couches look beautiful and we will definitely do an annual cleaning from now on!</Text>< resp>

So I was extremely hesitant to get my carpets cleaned because I didn't want some weirdo coming over while I was home with my kids. Lol anyways Joe showed up and proved to be one of he nicest people. I was pleased with the service provided and the job he did. I would definitely recommend them to anyone needing a cleaning.</Text>

I am Chris from Wallys Carpet. We use Joe on a regular basis for our  cleaning needs and when we have an issue with a consumer who cant get a stain out of our stain proof carpet we send Joe. The other day we got a call from a customer concerned about a stain they couldn't get out. They had a cleaning company come out and they had no luck. Thinking they had defective carpet they called us so we asked Joe to handle it for us. Joe knows the proper ways to clean each kind of carpet. Every kind of carpet is different and needs special techniques to clean. We trust Joe and he has never let us down as a matter of fact he over exceeds  our expectations.  Our customers call us back raving about him and are so happy that their new carpet looks great again.<//Review>

Thanks Joe and Michelle!!

Joe and Michelle are such good professionals with a personal touch. I was moving into a house (I think it was not cleaned for years and the carpet was colorful from stains) and had issues with my utilities and had to change schedule with Joe for 3 times. They understood the urgency in us moving on the right date and accommodated us through out. Joe and Michelle went to extent that Joe came for cleaning later in the evening just to make it happen on the day I wanted, although it was my fault with cancelling the previous 2 appointments.

I would definitely suggest Eco Pro to all my friends. They are not picky and do the job to perfection. If you want a honest and trustworthy person to perform a perfect job then you can close your eyes and pick Joe and Eco Pro.  Thanks again Joe and Michelle.</review>

<review>I have had Eco Pro clean my carpets, area rugs and couches more times than I can count! They're a one-of-a-kind business! Joe has integrity for the craft and doesn't take any short cuts! When I was certain my dogs were peeing in one of my rooms, he gave me some glasses to wear and got out his black light to show me exactly what was going on! He can specially treat such situations and the carpet is left as new!!! He even left spot cleaner for me to use as needed till his next visit!
Scheduling is easy peasy and Michelle is a doll!!!
This is a family-owned local business that deserves the best and deserves our loyalty!!

I recommend the Joe Eco Pro 100%!</review>< Pics>

EcoPro is the absolute best!  Joe scotch guarded my new furniture three years ago and I sent him an emergency message today that I got some cheese grease (I never eat on my furniture and did today - won't do that again)  on my couch and asked what to do.  He came over with a spot remover as "part of their customer service" to help me out.  Mind you folks....it's been THREE years since he scotch guarded it.  Definitely not something he needed to do and most certainly not something anyone else would have done.

Not only are they great at their service, but their customer service is par none!  Thanks, Joe, for helping me out today.</Review>

< review>
I have used EcoPro numerous times since 2013. I've always loved to shop small business and local. But this wasn't just that type of business. They are family owned and operated. Joe arrives on time (early) presentable and does exceptional work. I always tell friends, family, and coworkers looking for a tile and carpet cleaner to go to EcoPro because they honestly work to clean and remove stains. It's not just a job to Joe; it's his passion I believe. I've experienced where I've ask just to clean and freshen up and Joe will work on something hespecial seen even though i didnt ask. While I was potty training I had Joe make a few visits because my son just wasn't getting it. (If ya know what I mean💩) Ive had to make many emergency calls and he would squeeze me in to take care of it. He has had a variety at our household. Desitin, hawaiian punch, pet stains, coffee, tea, dirt, and heavy trafficking. When I sold my first home in 2014 I had Joe clean the carpets; everyone thought I had new carpets installed. I can go on for days raving about this company but to simplify it...
ECOPRO IS AN AFFORDABLE, NICE AND EFFICIENT COMPANY TO HAVE CLEAN YOUR FLOORS. HANDS DOWN!!!<//review>

<text>Ordered shoes, i was told we wil recieve a call and email when they arrive.  Waited for 2 weeks.....nothing.   figured they just hadn't come in yet, waited another 2 weeks still no call or text. My husband called the store to check the status of the shoes. They had been in the store for the past 3 weeks!!! When asked why they didn't call or email they tild us they were busy. When i went to pick them up i was asked why i wasnt notified and i was told by a female that they were too busy. I replied with too busy ti make a 2min call and she said yes!!
Apparently,  customers who ordered products are not of importance compared to customers who come and shop!
I will take my business elsewhere. Thanks< /text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80ea6a701d417e29:0x4c073f3278f9342<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I learned a lot about sneakers and am happy to be a regular customer, i've made friends with some of the workers and couldn't be happier with the service, great store, four outta five because my shoe sizes are always taken. Great store though.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I do like the store, however its becoming clear that people can go in and steal whenever they want with no consequences,  and in itself scares me because that is a situation that can become dangerous for both customers and employees. They need security there fast before things keep escalating. I know things are getting bad because i know someone who works there. Maybe bringing it up here will help.</text>

Customer service was horrible, the man at the register was completely rude, like who told u to join my conversation with my friend. If anything he should of just minded his business. But other than that everything was good.<//text>

Mario's lackluster on customer service skills definitely needs some work. I mean he was too busy worried about the length on his shirt into let's see I don't know bag my items but overall the service< /review>

<review>This store is very dirty inside and outside there's so much merchandise on the floors shelves empty the employees were holding the comforters sets and all pods for there self in the back I over heard one associate pull another associate to the side saying if she wanted a comforter there in the back the coupons expire for all pods on 2/2/2019 I asked about rain check they say they don't have them the employees needs to clean the store up instead of buying up the sale items the floor is dirty behind the register is always dirty its only 1 register open and other associates just walking around or on there phones all phones need to be put in lockers and need training if more than 3/4 in line open another and especially at the beginning of the month also clean the bathroom .</review>< pictures>

< Review>
We love this place it's so warm cozy and the employees are friendly. We love the old fashioned style and all of the boutique items they sell. Just a really pleasant environment. They have good bulk candy to choose from and lots of old-fashioned candies as well. We love to sit and enjoy hot chocolate or nice chai latte. They also have chocolate truffles and other chocolate treats in a refrigerated case.< /Review>

Best coffee and chocolate around! Super friendly atmosphere, fresh beans, better than Starbucks lattes in the back, 💕💝  the famous Christmas Blend, the freshly made chocolates and candies make fantastic gifts… I love this place!< /Text>

I can't get enough of their Kaula coffee drink. It's delicious! Nice place to treat out someone for coffee or to try some of their chocolate creations.

They also got cool little items for home decor.

Point blank, cool little place to show someone around in Simi valley.< /review>

The customer service in this place is horrible. The owner is RUDE and she doesn't take responsibility for her business. She is real quick to take your money......but if you have a problem, not even an attempt to keep you happy. Will sell you overpriced and broken products and then refuse to replace them. To bad.

Do yourself a favor and stay as far away from this place as possible.</review>

Best shakes and coffees in town!!!! Starbucks who?? No comparison !! Great old time candy store and Soda fountain.  Fantastic friendly staff ....Awesome assortment of coffee concoctions!! Or create your own. Every time I'm in Simi Valley I gotta have a large Funky Monkey, or maybe it's Chunky Monkey, regardless , chocolate, fresh banana blended coffee .....mmmm , well worth the 500 mile drive from my house!!</review>

A great local candy and coffee shop with lots of really neat nick nacks scattered about for sale. Extensive flavored and unflavored coffee selection in 1lb or 1/2 lb options which you can get whole bean or ground to your liking.  They serve hot and cold coffee drinks, baked treats and have a few tea options. This place really feels like it belongs on some quaint small town Americana Main Street. This is a testament to both the owners and the dichotomy that runs through Simi Valley.</Text>

What a friggen cute place!! I had no idea this placed existed in the valley, came here for some coffee and was just surprised, this place takes you back in time when candy stores exist. The smell was incredible, sweet and chocolate-y. I got the caramel mocha coffee and it was yummy :). This place has speciality coffee beans that you can purchase. If you buy a cup, I think you get a free cup of coffee.</text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

They have absolutely best coffee selection. Hugh variety of flavored coffees. Will sell it ground or whole bean. Greatest seasonal coffee. There Christmas blend is well sought after. Greatest seasonal gifts. Plus an expert team to create the best cup of coffee as you can sit and enjoy. Cold or hot the best. Then the candy section is amazing.  Home made fudge in flavors I never knew available. They will take care of your custom gift orders. Have used them over and over for easy Christmas giving. They will also mail there coffees to your family from there store.  MUST GO TO THIS STORE.<//review>

They got everything, coffee, candy, the whole shabang. Also a really nice staff. Only gripe I have with it is that it's pretty small. However that's not something they have control over.< /text>

<Text>I'm so glad this place has re-opened and that the new ownership seems dedicated to maintaining a stable business model. I went in to buy candy for my kids for easter baskets, and they were more than happy to help me select from the bulk candies. The person helping me had lots of great tips, and she was right -- the gummy candies really all do have different flavors and tastes. The peachy penguins do, surprisingly, really taste peachy.< /Text>< user_name>

Used to go here all the time when I was a kid (90's). Really happy to see they are still in business. I will have to stop in when I'm back on that side of the country again. They have had that fortune telling machine since the 90's as well.</review>

OMG!! I could cry right now!! My car sounds stereo system soooo good! Brandon is the best at what he does! My car stock system was trash and speakers were busted! I stopped by the shop and Brandon serviced me right away. I got 2 new speakers, amp, car radio sub woofer and he even included tweeters and a phone microphone for voice calls! The price is unmatched! He really hooked me up. I was so  surprised! It’s Perfect! I don’t ever want to get out of my car! It sounds so good! Go here now! You won’t be disappointed. Just trust him. He has 30 years experience. PERFECT! Thank you!</Text>

I’ve always came here for their services. Wonderful people and hands down the best work! Very honest and reasonable prices. I came today again for an amp and realized also my subwoofer was bad. They were able to squeeze me in and made everything work. I really appreciate them! Definitely recommend them in your in LB area next to LBCC campus< /Review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>It is a family owned business and their prices are good. They are very kind people and make sure that you get the right product that you need for what you are there for. I had got an alarm put in my truck from another place and they didn't install it correctly, so I brought it to PERFECT AUTO SOUND and they fixed it right and now I dont have any problem with the alarm. Just had speakers installed and they sound great. I am not going to go any where else this is a great place to go.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80dd3166853cfdcb:0x624f3c16e595c662</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Brandon and his partner in crime (wife?) were the best people. Just so kind and helpful. They gave me two chairs to sit and eat my lunch and a water! I love my new radio and it was definitely affordable. They installed it very quickly and had great music coming from the garage! And their name is “Perfect Auto Sound!” How could you go wrong?!<//Text>< pics>

I walked in here last minute to get a stereo for my car. I was greeted right away, the price was amazing compared to other locations! I was in and out no more than an hour and I left satisfied. The owners are such good people. I will definitely be back and I will definitely recommend. Thank you!< /Review>

<Review>Went in today to get my windows tinted for my 2017 honda civic. The work done was amazing. No bubbles, no scratches or anything well done indeed. Even the price was the best around. I checked all around Groupon and this was still better for the work they do. Highly recommend it. Also go earlier cause there is a wait time for your vehicle.< /Review><user>114644009714981425011</user></record></dataset><record>

I just got my window tinted yesterday on my 2018 Honda CR-V. All 4 windows and the top front. Price was great, $190. If you don’t want the top front than it’s only $150. Very fast, just make sure you give them a call first to see if they are busy or not..other than that it’s 1hr to 2hr wait. Asian man and his lady, at least 20yr of experience. Would recommend this place to anybody that is looking for a quick and non pricey service. Very nice people.<//review>

This is definitely my favorite place to go to when tuning up my Scion. I came here to change out my speaker system, replace the headlight bulbs to LED, and the entire housing to HID strip lights. Phenomenal quick job with a reasonable price. Currently my favorite spot!</text>

Disclaimer: I had a complex job involving a lot of parts.

I went to Perfect Auto Sound and discussed my job specifics and was reassured that the electrical work could be handled.
When I returned and discussed the specifics of the job at every step I was told it could be done.  When I reached a point that the representative felt he couldn't do he told me the whole job was too difficult and couldn't be done at all and to go to another shop.
I began by showing him the light and the instructions which I wanted connected above the driver and passenger side.  The light didn't need to be wired to anything other than power (I.E. the light did not need to turn on or off with the doors).  He said he could do it.
I was asking for a power line to be run from the battery to the rear of the vehicle which I was told could be done.
I asked for a fuse brick, which I supplied, to be connected to the power which I was told, with instructions, could be done.
Finally, I I showed him two additional lights that needed to be hooked up which but that's when I was told the job was way too much work and too complex and he couldn't do any of it.
Perfect Auto Sound seems to be good at window tinting. I saw him working on a tint job that looked really good but for any electrical work, big or small, I would avoid this shop.
I can't tell you if he was just confused in my original description of the work or if he uses deceptive sales tactics to get you to return to the shop but what I do know is that if your job seems even slightly too difficult he will just avoid the work all together.< /text>

This has been the best tint experience I’ve had! There was faded tint on my back window (I wasn’t aware of) and they removed it without charging me a fortune. Very reasonably priced and the tint is top notch quality! I will definitely be going back to get my other car tinted here. Not only for the great work but mainly for the amazing customer service!</text>

More like perfect tint and dash cams😉🤗 because they not only gave me a good deal but they also gave me a superb warranty & set up on my 2020 Lexus UX. Not to mention my mom liked the job so much she got her car tented yesterday(she loves it) and now I think my dad wants to get on the wagon LMAO 😂. Copycats🙃🤦🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️<//review>

< Review>
This guy kicks ass.  I stopped by after I had gone to Best buy and got shut down because they would have had to order the parts and wait a week to install the stereo that I wanted.  He got me in an hour later and installed it for half the price of best buy and did an awesome job.  Saved my butt since I was supposed to have my girlfriend's car ready by the time she got back from vacation and waited till the last minute. I'll definitely go back to him when I get a new one for my car. Thank you!!< /Review>

I've brought 3 cars here, RAV4, Honda Accord Coupe and 4 dr Toyota Camry. I've been happy with all tint jobs. I can just drop my car off and return when they are finished. Great shop to have in this city. I have referred all my friends and family to Perfect Auto Sound.</Text>< Gmap_id>

<review>I got my car tinted. Brandon got it done perfectly in 2 hours. I just dropped it off, grabbed lunch with a friend, came back in a couple hours and it was ready to go.

Note: They share the lot with the "Next Car" used car company. So it was a little difficult to find.<//review><rate>5</rate><gmap_id>0x80dd3166853cfdcb:0x624f3c16e595c662<//gmap_id><Pics>None</Pics>< name>

It takes one, to know one.

Like the last place I went to, he didn't even charge me, or even attempt to.  Where in the event, I would put him in a shop that matches the service being.  Immaculate.</Review>

<Review>Took my car for insurance claim, driver side window was broken. Took about 1 month due to the car needed a deep clean to remove broken glass. When i got the car back i found glass on the seat tracks, back seat, glove box, center console, wedged into the leather seats and even on the sunroof screen that fell when i closed the blind. They also used some type of cleaning solution that ruined my rear window tint.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Dr. Puff is just amazing.  He has such a  great style, he makes you feel comfortable talking about anything.  His positive reinforcement and down to earth topics make listening a pleasure.  If you haven't had a chance to listen to a podcast...I would suggest you do.  Thank you Dr. Puff for your ability to communicate so effectively!<//text>

Dr. Puff speaks truth. His podcast and blog have been very inspiring for me, and I think everyone can benefit from what he teaches. In person, he is warm, genuine, and really caring, and he will help you live your best life. If you or someone you know wants to live a happier life, or if you are a business owner who wants to have a happier workplace, I highly recommend talking to Dr. Puff.</text>

< Review>
What I've enjoyed about my experience with Robert is that he has a deeper, more well-rounded view of the human being.  I am a huge advocate for science as a way to explain the world, but I love how Robert doesn't stop with the science.  He is able to go beyond that and touch on the deeper more spiritual gifts and lessons.  I feel that this is absolutely necessary to living well and I'm grateful that Robert is putting this good will out into the world.</Review>

I am the queen of habits and they are definitely not all good ones.  I became a fan of Dr. Puff through some of his material in Psychology Today and some other publications that I read.  I particularly have gotten a great deal of benefit from his Happiness Podcast and 3 Steps for Changing Bad Habits into Good Habits.   I find his tone to be very engaging, non-judgmental and honest.  This brings credibility to any material that I choose to listen to or read.  The fact that Dr. Puff embraces things like spirituality and meditation are appealing to me as well.   I feel like I have much to learn from his teachings and have just hit the tip of the iceberg.  Great stuff.<//review>

<text>Dr. Puff's podcast is life changing.  The episodes go over various circumstances that prevent people from being happy.  So much of what Dr. Puff talks about is relevant to most people.  Through the various episodes, one learns that our happiness is not so much determined by what happens in life, but rather how we view and respond to circumstances.  The podcasts are free, along with his meditation sessions on Wednesday nights.  What a great service to the world Dr. Puff is providing.</text>< user_id>

<Response>None</Response><review>Dr. Puff's podcast, most especially episode # 87 "What''s Wrong With Right Now" has been a game changer. I've followed his advice and immersed myself in studying how to quiet my mind, and I listen to this one episode multiple times every day. The calmness it giving me is absolutely astounding. I had no idea how busy my mind had become, and his work is helping me see that and change it for the better. I'm extremely grateful for his generosity in putting this work out, and for his vast knowledge that he shares!</review>< Rating>

Dr. Robert Puff’s free weekly meditations are a real gift. After 30 min of a simple guided mediation concentrating on the breath, while subtle music is discreetly played in the background,  he continues with a 30min conversation offering insights from his many years of spiritual practice and clinical psychology work.  In one hour you get to relax your mind, slow down your thought whirl and hear some wise and uplifting words. Check it out - you won't be disappointed !< /text>

I love the Happiness podcast!  I learn so much from each one about how to reorganize my thoughts in order to bring about peace, happiness and personal growth to my life.  It also helps me gain tools to teach my young daughter about happiness, including not comparing yourself to others, the importance of being with nature, and surrounding yourself with happy people.  I get all giddy every time I start a podcast!< /Review>

I love to clam my self down and relax completely by listening to Happiness Podcast at the end of the day. I have never thought that the meaning of happiness would be that deep and interesting until I start listening to this podcast. Every podcast gives me energy and strength to face with all the challenges in my life peacefully and of course happily.
Thank you so much, Dr Robert Puff.</review>

I am positively thrilled by the effect that holistic therapy had on me. This philosophy changed my life and I have no doubt that it will change yours too. The podcast I listened to is by one of the best psychologists out there, Dr. Robert Puff. The title is #51 Happiness- Three Key Components for Staying Happy.

Dr.Puff is widely recognized in the public by the effect he has assisting each client in order to achieve the main goals of happiness and well-being. This holistic approach envelops many of the things we do in life such as thoughts, emotions, health and nutrition as well as relationships. These things have a substantial meaning to our lives, giving those clear priorities and focus to the key things.

In order to improve your happiness, you will hear personal experience lessons by Dr.Puff and stress management lessons which will undoubtedly be an asset to each person’s beliefs of improving their life.</review>

Dr. Puff’s Happiness Podcast has helped me through some very rough times, and I continue to listen to them on the way to work and in my free time because I have seen how a change in perspective and a mindfulness practice can truly help me find the joy in the present moment. I have even emailed Dr. Puff with a personal question and he has quickly and joyfully responded, giving me reassurance that he is not only wise and knowledgeable, but kind and caring. Check them out for a happier you!</Review>

I feel like I can finally start being happy in my life and he is teaching me how to handle different situations in life. I have suffered from depression anxiety general unhappiness many years of my life and having him to listen to grounds me. Makes me live in the now and except myself ,my problems and gives me hope that I will one day get to the place where I want to be in life that’s it’s not a dream and that it will be a reality some day. Thank you thank you so much Dr,Puff for what you do I always thought I will never have a good therapist and will never get the help because I could never afford one.

I truly enjoy listening to Dr. Puff. He is real world, down to earth, applicable advice that you can use in your life every single day. If you are feeling down, or feel like giving up, like it's not worth it - then I encourage you to go to his website and listen to one of his podcasts. They are sure to help you in ways that you can't imagine. His soothing voice will help you to relax and let your guard down while he gives you tools, tips, and tricks to make your life the best it can be and to truly find the happiness that you seek.
Whenever a bad day hits - I know where I will be heading to for some awesome encouragement!<//review>

< Review>
Hello!! I'm a Brazilian listener. I want to say THANK YOU. Just like this, with capital letters. I know that this is just one more feedback, but I felt I should tell you guys, how it's been valuable for me listening to Dr. Robert Puff's podcasts. I suffer from anxiety disorder and depression. There was a time, when it was hard to say it. To confess it. Today I'm a little more aware of these problems and I've been doing my best in order to get better. And the reason why I wanna say THANK YOU, is that when I feel uncomfortable, anxious, depressed or overwhelmed, I put on my headphones, switch off the lights and just listen and pay attention to his words, his reasoning about embracing the moment... Accept it like it is... And feel grateful for it. When the sound stops, I feel renewed, relieved, calm... And in peace. Thank you, Dr. Robert.< /Review>

This is about the weekly meditation retreat that Dr Puff runs at his office. It is a great way for beginners starting the meditation practice. Along with meditation in the group, you get to hear wise words from Dr. Puff. Truly enlightening experience</review>

<time>1430793389392<//time><rating>5</rating><review>I am so happy to have come across Dr. Robert Puff and his highly knowledgeable, passion fueled podcasts.  This is my first experience listening to a self-help podcast and I was instantly sucked in to the soothing, comforting sound of Dr. Puff's voice.  I found myself absorbing his words in an almost hypnotic state, very relaxing.  Since I am going through a very traumatic time in my life, the end of a nearly 25 year relationship with my husband who is also my high school sweetheart,
I need to gather all the helpful coping mechanisms I can get my hands on.  There are days when I truly don't know how to go on, and those are the days I will continue to turn to his words for direction.  It's almost like having a therapy session at your fingertips whenever you need one!  It's comforting to know I have this expertise to turn to when things really seem to be falling apart for me.  I believe that everything happens for a reason, and today I was directed to his #56 Happiness - Finding Happiness and Living Well with the Ongoing Challenges podcast for a reason.  It was just something that was brought to me as a tool.  I've already sent the link to his site off to a friend that I know can use it, and I highly recommend it to anyone in need of less worry or way to remind themselves that this too shall pass!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Your words keep the part of my mind that craves expansion and growth fed while allowing the other part of my brain to settle into the methodical routine that is required to get the job done.  I have been on an eternal quest to better myself in order to show up more fully for those around me in all aspects of my life.  Your podcasts are a nice contribution toward this goal.

<Review>I have been listening to Dr. Puff's Happiness podcast for about eight months. Every time I feel stressed and am overwhelmed with an "event" or a worry, I reach for my phone and Dr. Puff gets me back to living life well. I spend more time living in the moment and tell my nasty little voice inside my head to go away! I am finding it easier to get back to living rather than worrying about what might happen! It's not easy to re-program habits of worrying about others and how they see me, etc. but it certainly helps to practice making choices about where my mind takes me! I'm so much happier!</Review><rating>5<//rating><userid>108682231968129389837< /userid></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Dr. Puff's podcast is so uplifting! I just discovered it today and it really shifted the way I thought about grief and handling that grief. There are times where his podcast has even made me laugh! He keeps it really light and positive, even when exploring topics that are frightening or anxiety-inducing. It's great to see someone trying to spread positivity, happiness, and understanding in the world.</Text><response>None<//response>< rating>

<user_name>Juwan Johnson</user_name><rate>5</rate><review>The Happiness Podcast was excellent and really gave me the juice that I needed to make some adjustments to my everyday life. I'm a full-time student with 21 credit hours, a part-time job, an internship and a huge load of extracurricular activities, but I still try my best to stay as positive as I can. However, I often have mornings where it's a little bit harder to wake up, a little bit harder to smile at work and really tough to get the most out of my school work. The happiness podcast reminds me that it takes a lot more energy to be anxious, stressed, or unhappy than it does to be happy.
As a Peer Mentor it's an excellent tool to provide to my students when they're feeling down. It gets them into the mindset that life really is a permanent vacation. Dr. Puff's podcasts have become an essential part of my lifestyle adjustment here at college and I recommend it to anyone who needs a little happiness in their day.</review></record></dataset><record>

I came across this podcast on the TuneIn app in August, and over the last several months this podcast has had an enormous positive impact on my life.  It first brought me awareness of my ego's constant commentary and the thoughts that kept me trapped in unhappiness.  The podcast's messages helped me to see things with a completely different perspective and have helped me to have greater control of my happiness while learning to pick my battles, accept change, and live in the moment.  People have noticed and remarked on my change in attitude.  I cannot recommend this podcast enough to people seeking happiness.<//Text>

The Happiness Podcast is calming and fulfilling. I especially enjoyed the podcast about what to do when bad things happen. It was empowering to hear the way we can deal with what we view as tragedies in our lives. Acceptance of suffering is something I struggle with. The path to focusing on making good by learning lessons toward change and bettering our lives is a positive course for all of us. Learning from mistakes is sometimes like facing a mirror we never want to look into, but it is beneficial for the future. Keep up the good work!<//text>

<text>Dr. Robert Puff's podcast on Happiness really resonated with me. He makes you think about one of the harsh realities of life that we face in everyday living - criticism and how it impacts us from truly being happy in life. Criticism in our lives is unavoidable. At some point and in some way we will be criticized.  After all, we cannot please everyone. He talks about the nine steps that we can take to handle criticism in order to find happiness in our personal lives. One of the steps, judging others that he talks about, has to be one of the biggest and most difficult changes that we could all make. After listening to the nine steps, I came away understanding my reactions to criticism and how criticism has over the years impacted me in being happy in my life. I am more knowledgeable, self-aware, confident and ready for the challenges that I will face in life and better equipped to handle criticisms.< /text><username>Orlando Madonald< /username><rate>5< /rate><userid>111182378619809260523< /userid><response>None</response>< gmapID>

< Review>
I've been listening to Dr. Puff's podcasts for the last few days, where he explores issues related to happiness: what it means to be happy and how to achieve contentment in life. The setup of his podcasts is simple (him speaking over what sounds like a faint excerpt of Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier) but the format works amazingly well. The simplicity of the format means less distraction from the weighty themes he's wrestling with, such as the nature of happiness and how dreams relate to it. These are really soothing to listen to before bedtime and they've already given me food for thought about how to evaluate my life. Highly recommended for anyone out there who's reflective and wants five minutes of enrichment to start the day.</Review>

I listened to the 58 Happiness - Treating Life as a Permanent Vacation and I must say I really enjoyed it. I'm not too fond of podcasts, but Dr. Puff's podcast helped me realize a few things about how I view my life.

He talked about letting go of things - When we are attached to things, we get upset because we don't want to lose those things when things change. However, if we were to let go, we wouldn't get upset over the things that are not permanent.

Recently, I had a job interview that I have been wanting for the past 4 years. I finally got the interview, but I ended up stuttering and saying the wrong things. I got upset over this because I knew I did horrible. Now I realize that I need to let go of this interview and not be so attached because if not I will not be happy.

This podcast really helped me see things a little bit differently and now I definitely feel like I can be much happier.</review>

<review>The podcast gave great insight into how the real world works, and how happiness should be our state of mind the majority of the time. I learned that comparing and contrasting makes us miss out on the present. It really is true. I really like the way he speaks about things in a very understandable way. I can definitely see myself listening to his podcasts often.< /review>< Pics>

I listen to Dr. Puff's podcasts at least once a week. His Happiness Podcast really helped me get though grad school. Grad school was difficult and I experienced some depression and anxiety about my education and they honestly gave me hope. It also taught me to honor my own need for self-care. Also, I often listen to his Meditation for Health Podcast. I know that many people roll their eyes at meditation, but Dr. Puff provides sounds scientific evidence showing the benefits of meditating. I've been meditating for less than a year (I started to help cope with anxiety attacks in grad school) and have seen positive results.<//Text>

<text>I'm obviously not anywhere near Newport Beach right now, but I found Dr. Puff's blog and podcast online. I was initially drawn in by the name, but he's seriously good. His happiness podcasts helped me reevaluate my life and reconsider my dependence on some very negative people. The information is good, he doesn't use a load of medical mumbo-jumbo and his voice is pleasant to listen to.

I'd definitely recommend his website and podcast to people who want to get their lives in track and are feeling a bit overwhelmed by everything.< /text>< Rate>

<Review>I have really enjoyed listening to the "Finding Our Happiness Flow" audiobook from start to finish and I was not bored a single minute. It made me feel much better and more enthusiastic about my life and I learned a lot about new ways of achieving personal happiness. The ideas behind the audiobook are very well explained and seem not too hard to implement. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great "self-help" book about finding true happiness.< /Review>< Resp>

The happiness podcast gives you the steps and strategies to be a better person, as well as allowing yourself to understand why it is that maybe you are not always a happy person.
I believe this podcast could assist others in a very positive way.</Text>

Overcoming sadness, depression, anger are just few my favorite podcasts. I'm always watching out for new podcasts because they are simply reminders for me to live in the now and not delve into the past and creating thoughts that may ruin my relationships with other people. I also tend to share what I have been listening to other people so that they may share my happiness. Thank you, Dr. Puff.</text>

<Date>1389390624953<//Date><Text>Dr. Puff is one of the best teachers I've ever come across. He is a kind and generous man who is good at making the abstract tangible. I found him to be a credible meditation teacher because he understands and combines both science and spirituality in his teachings. His teachings can be found through his: podcasts, ebooks, books, seminars and retreats.

Before him I was searching, searching and searching for, the meaning in life, enlightenment, purpose and etc. I never had peace of mind, I never felt satisfied, I was living in my mind. But, after hearing all of Dr. Puff's podcasts and going to his weekly Wednesday evening seminars for about a year, I finally realized I needed to stop searching and start living. And it has forever changed my life.<//Text>< user>

Huge selection of video games. I come with my little brother and buy games. Also grew up going there the atmosphere Is cool. The service is good the workers are very nice. The trade in system isn't good however. But it's still a excellent place!<//review>

Let me tell you great customer service!
I was calling on regards to my PlayStation 4 and spoke with a guy name Marquis. He was so helpful with the information I needed to reboot my nephew’s PlayStation. I knew nothing about it and I had already called 4 other Game Stops, but the one in El Monte came through, well actually Marquis did. Thank you!< /Review>

The usual. Depending on the time you go I guess. I was one of the first ones in today at about 10:02 AM or there abouts. Didn't get the gentleman's name who rang me to but he's very friendly and knowledgeable. Now, when this place gets busy, it's BUSY! Especially with all them little kids that are loud and grab everything... I'm guessing most video game stores are probably like this.< /Review>

Seemed well stocked on used games for Xbox and Ps4, staff was friendly enough and its a rather large store compared to most. You don't feel like you are in a closet looking for games like most Stores.</text>

< Review>
They straight lied to us, guy working the cashier had told us that that they had run out of the exclusive Fortnite “codes” for the pickaxe this and they had run out that morning, we entered the store around  2, like at 3 my nephew pulled to gamestop and immediately saw a kid walking out with a card code. Then my nephew walked in and they told him that the kid before had took the last code they had. What absolute lier, keep in mind Im not some 10 year old, I had money to spend, but they told me they didn’t have anymore.</Review>

If you need help the staff is always there to help you and will give you the option of another store to visit if they don't have what you want.

I was wary pre-ordering again, but this time it all went smoothly. I'm still firm in physical copies over digital so I'll keep buying here as long as I keep playing games. Employees have mostly been very friendly with a few exceptions here and there.< /text>< Gmap_id>

It's fine.  I bought NBA 2K19 here from a male cashier.  He's cool. I'm giving it 3 stars because of him, and that's it

The other times I come here is when someone else is working there.  Mostly females, I can't speak for all of them but the ones I encounter do not greet me.  I guess they think I'm a hobo with my sign board? Heh. The Dollar tree ladies don't greet me either. Odd. So, anyways.  I don't feel welcomed at this GS so I go to the one in Alhambra.

This GameStop employee's might be cool with other customers, but I'm okay going to some place else.  I once did buy a used ps3 game, the employee had given me a broken disc with a cheap cover, she nicely replaced it with another copy with an original cover with it, kinda confused why she wouldn't give me that in the first place.  Not that I'm spoiled, its' just, "hey, this customer might like the one with the actual cover.  I might make his day with it.". Nah, that didn't originally happen.

It's clean and organized. Moderately busy on the weekends.  The employees are nice but genuinely is the question.< /text>

Super petty business. PS4 has a tiny little slit on joystick that can be easily fixed and they want the controller for free basically on a PS4 trade in, so it drops your value by a full controller and still take your controller...how are you going to have a special but then undercut the original price.<//review>

< review>
I find it funny how most of the reviews here aren't really reviews it just seems some of these people went to this GameStop once or twice and just because they didn't have anyone at the counter right away they just say "Gee this place has shitty service." I mean I've been going to this GameStop for years never had a bad experience at all, I mainly go to this one just because I never ever got mad. The workers are cool and always answer my questions well in store and on the phone, I just think people are always in a rush or can't wait a few minutes anymore. I get annoyed at some of the customers that come in ask stupid questions and follow up with another question now that's a pain in the ass, I like this GameStop a lot, people just need to stop hatin.< /review>

Worst gamestop. Staff is horrible, especially the guy with a ton of horrible tattoos. Usually only one person in the entire store. Avoid this gamestop.< /Review>

Willie worked on my tax return and suffice it to say she did so in a fast and efficient manner. She gave off an air of utmost professionalism and expertise in her field.

I had stock investments, multiple w2 forms, and Willie was able to do all of this before my lunch break was over.

If your taxes are more complicated than what you can manage on turbo tax, then going thru a professional office such as this location will save you so much time and ache.

Already an hour has passed and I have confirmation that my return has been accepted.

Cheers!< /review>

Excellent service and consistency. I saw the same person as last year and his remembered me. The receptionist also remembered me and even though I showed up 20 minutes early for my appointment, I didn't have to wait and was able to sit down and get started right away. Everyone is very knowledgeable and knows what they're talking about, and their friendly, polite, and professional. During tax time when everyone is anxious and confused, they are calm and comforting.<//Text>

Staff not knowledgable about taxes or products. I felt like we were scammed into going in there and paying 300 for an advance we couldn't get. I had already done the taxes in 15 min and could have filed for free. Waste of 300. They told me on the phone I didn't have to pay if we couldn't get the advance! We were never giving a pricing sheet  or told when I called and asked.<//Review>

Writing this as i am waiting in line for 20 plus mins.  There are two girls in the back of the store casually folding clothes and chatting.  The women in line in front of me finally walked out after asking if someone could help her speed things up.  There is no dressing room even though restrictions have been lifted in this area and other stores in the area allow it.  What a mess!  Won’t be back.</text>

<review>Made my shopping experience easy. I went not knowing my size, and the employee showed me the different styles that fit my body type. So grateful. Thank you for making me feel comfortable.  This store had something for my whole family. Even bought a gift for a birthday party. Great one stop shop.<//review><username>noemi berumen<//username><Rating>5<//Rating>< user>

I love guess. I love their style.  Granted I I always afford all the things that I think after cute.  But they always have good stuff on clearance and the staff of always super nice.  It's my favorite store at the pismo outlets.< /review>

Bad customer service worst i have ever seen one of the managers came out and yelled at us when we were already shopping 5 stores away cant believe it wanna know the reason why cause I asked for a price and she said it has a dang tag on it....and then I said well that was rude...for someplace that should have high customer service they really let there place go. And for her to come out of her store on company time and yell and my mom and dad on vacation that was way wrong!<//review>

<Text>Went on the Happy Hour Tour on my birthday and it was such a memorable experience ✨! With all of the social distancing restrictions they only had limited seating outdoors. Honestly, it was a better experience this way! It was a bit cool where we sat at the bow so bring a jacket. We split a bottle of Proseco ($28 I think) and there were snacks available that looked great... But we were saving room for dinner. 🥩 The waters were kind and smooth,  and even with all the smoke in the air you could still see the outline of the mountains across the lake. I can't even imagine the view when the air is clear. Staff was the best, so nice and VERY fast. We will absolutely return for another tour when we are back!!! Such a great value for what you get, I would have paid more and still been happy!< /Text><Time>1600969328460<//Time><rating>5</rating><Resp>None<//Resp>< Name>

The blue water and beautiful day added to the experience, but this was certainly one of the highlights of our trip to Tahoe.

Not be underestimated but the tour guide/boat captain was exceptional on our tour.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbCgYqo_kTQwUtQK_1llRnPadWt3NiSHlLkEM7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIUSjY9_gGhuadOqrgY3PpF0oPY_n_osAuF0ii=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< response>

<Review>We chose the lunch cruise and it was awesome , great view , nice staff and the nachos and Caesar chicken wrap we got was great but a bit expensive. Right now most of the passengers are required to sit out on the deck and only one family allowed in the top covered deck . They do provide umbrellas for the sun and restrooms are available as well .</Review>< Pictures>

The only thing, and it is not worth removing a star, that wasn't perfect is they were out of a few things on the menu but it is the end of the cruise season. I'm just glad they are able to continue operating with everthing that's going on with Covid. My hats off to all businesses that are making it work.<//Review><rating>5<//rating>< gmap_id>

The website gives you an option to book the “dinner cruise” but not buy their dinner. The reviews on their food are bad, so we thought “Great! We’ll have an early dinner, then go enjoy drinks on the boat.” The morning of the cruise two members of my party get calls from two different people. First call is from a woman who says we are being “upgraded to a private room.” She was told we really wanted to be out on the deck. She said the room is really open and has a deck so you can go outside. The second call was from Larry to another member of our group. He also claimed the room is an upgrade and said that because of the size of our party (12) that was really the only option. So we agreed because it was that or cancel and we were leaving Tahoe the next day. That evening we arrive and the “upgraded” room is a small, stuffy, hot room behind the person driving the boat. Dirty glass windows that don’t open on two sides.  The deck we could go out on was actually a small walkway where we were constantly bumped by wait staff elbowing past with trays. We asked to talk to Larry about it before boarding and he told us “You agreed! Too bad!” Wow. The customer service is seriously lacking. I could share more details in that regard, but this review is already quite long. In summary, I strongly do not recommend.<//text>

<Review>Tahoe Gal dinner cruise, 2.5 hours, was terrific. Although a bit pricey when dinner is added in, the experience outstanding.

The paddleboat has a dining area below and an upper deck, both with tables and chairs.

The prime rib and salmon were very nice, side dishes were adequate.

Boat has a well stocked bar.

Staff did a nice job and were friendly to guests. Restroom was good.

Half of the cruise occcured in daylight and we were able to see the sun set.

Great way to see the lake!  Family friendly, good service, clean boat (and bathrooms!), and good drinks. Menu for the Happy Hour cruise covered munchies like chips-salsa to hamburgers. 1.5 hours was about right for folks with kids but would have enjoyed the longer cruise if it was date night. Military members cruise free. Thanks to Gal for the nod.< /review>

We did the lunch cruise around emerald bay and the views are fantastic and the captain’s narratives were interesting. A few important notes-  it was way too long to bring kids under 12. They were bored and ended up sleeping through the second half of it so that was a complete waste of money. More importantly- the food is atrocious. Plan to eat a hearty meal beforehand because you’re basically held captive for three and half hours during lunch time and $22 for literally the worst nachos you can imagine (think less-than movie theater quality, stale chips, cheap store bought  queso, and low grade store bought salsa (Note to owners- Costco has way more authentic  salsa options that are probably less expensive to keep in stock) and no available additions like guacamole or sour cream) and the pizza was $20 for only four tiny slices (enough for one kid, definitely not big enough to share) and only bearable because we were all so hungry. The sandwiches were only OK but much, much better than the previously mentioned items. Overall, I’d say for the cost of the ticket and the cost of the food, it is definitely not worth it. Especially if you have hungry kids. To the owners- please invest in a professional chef to create an easy menu that has quality food, or cut the prices of the food in half because the quality for the price is simply not justifiable, especially when we aren’t permitted to bring our own food on board. If the food were better than I would say it was worth the cost of the entire experience. Perhaps just book a shorter trip not focused around lunchtime dining.< /text>

<text>We took the 3 1/2 hour 12:30 cruise from Tahoe City to Emerald Bay and back, with lunch available for purchase. What an amazing experience! The captain did a wonderful job with his dictation of the history of the lake, the servers and bartenders were top notch, and the scenery was of course to die for! We would definitely do this again! What a relaxing way to see the lake and enjoy an afternoon. My only knock would be that the food and drinks were quite spendy!< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I’ve been on all the Tahoe Cruises and this is by far the best.  The staff was exceptional and the food was actually quite good.  My past experiences with the other cruises was not pleasant culinary wise so this was a pleasant surprise.  I like that the cruise doesn’t include the food as part of the fare because it gives you options to just enjoy the scenery and eat elsewhere either before or after if you choose.  I’ll do this one again when folks come to visit but not the others which are overpriced for what you get.  Another big plus is the free parking!</review>

We took the lunch cruise 14 years ago while on our honeymoon.  14 years later we came back to celebrate our anniversary with our kids.  Lexie was our server and she was on top of everything and not a complaint.  Capt. Augie was great.  Our boys got a kick out of him and the fact that he answered their questions, let them try driving and even make announcements over the intercom.

Thank you for the memorable anniversary and a special thank you to Captain and crew for being very down to earth and very personable with my boys, definitely made some memories for them.  Even though we are Bear's fans  lol< /review>

Magician was great and view, of course was amazing.  Especially when it began to be closer to 9 p.m. and the water was a pinkish color.</review>< pics>

< Review>
It was great to have a night out on the lake, however, the happy hour drink specials were no such thing. The pricing was not special and I was not happy. I will say that the drinks were well made, but I was low on funds and wish I could've afforded another. The staff was attentive and had good vibes.< /Review>

<text>Overpriced food and inattentive servers. We had nachoes that were similar to those at a little league ballpark, but much pricier. The bucket of Coronas was hot. 18% gratuity is automatically added to all checks.

The cruise itself was nice and peaceful. We were told there would be music and commentary, neither of which ever happened. This cruise is a "cram as many people as possible on the boat, make a lap, and dock with a little effort as possible" type cruise.< /text>< name>

< review>
This cruise ship is not handicap accessible as they claim. My partner is in a wheelchair, and even though I called before getting on the cruise to confirm that there were handicap accessible ways to get on the boat/enjoy most of the activities/use the bathroom, the bathrooms were not accessible at all. Getting physically on to the boat was fine, but getting from the on-ramp area into the first floor cabin was tough. We had to really squeeze the chair through the door to get it in.

From moving chairs to sit at a table was fine, but the bathroom situation was the worst. There were two small single-stall rooms. The men's was completely inaccessible to a wheelchair, and the women's was supposed to be "handicap accessible". I informed the crew that I didn't think that a chair would be able to enter the bathroom and close the door, and they insisted that it would be fine. They asked if we would be able to fold the chair to bring it into the room..... to which I had to explain that my partner cannot use their legs so there is no option to fold the chair because they need to be in the chair when entering. They said that they could have the makeshift solution of keeping a further up door open, blocking view of the women's bathroom, and they could have the kitchen keep the galley door closed to give my partner privacy in case the door didn't close. I still didn't believe the chair would fit so I had my partner try to enter the women's room..... the chair didn't even fit through the door frame. Meaning that this cruise thought it okay for my partner to relieve themselves in a hallway?

So yes, you can board the boat in a wheelchair, but you'd need a bladder of steel during dinner and drinks to survive because the chances that you'd be able to use the bathroom are slim unless you have a child-sized chair. I am most disappointed in the poor expectation setting when I called, and the fact that the onboard crew insisted it would be possible to fit a wheelchair in the bathroom.

On a separate note, the food wasn't good. We rented out the boat and had a prefixes menu with four options. I can confirm that at least 3/4 were bad. The teriyaki salmon had a sauce that was sickeningly sweet. The prime rib seemed tasteless. The Portobello mushroom dish tasted like everything had been marinated in straight balsamic vinegar for days. On  positive note, The views of the lake were fantastic, and if you were able bodied this cruise would be beautiful. But don't come for the food. Come for the views only.</review>

<text>We booked tickets like 2 hours before. Checked in right below cvs in tahoe city and were on our way. The only down side of cruising on the north side os missing the sunset but the sky is amazing regardless. We saw the rising of the moon (HUGE) over the water. Food was delicious if a little pricy but you dont  have to have it. Free boarding for active military another great perk. We enjoyed our anniversary dinner on top and they were nice enough to play our wedding song so we danced in the moonlight on lake tahoe. Definitely a memory forever. Great service. Great experience.</text>< pics>

<review>Not worth the money. If "cruise" means going back and forth on a 2 mile stretch of the lake is a type of cruise your looking for then go for it. We were disappointed to not see more of the lake. We ordered the chicken breast. It was overcooked and dry. Went to pay my bill in cash. I counted and recounted to ensure I had enough for the bill. Waitress comes back to say I'm $20 short.

Not worth it for the sunset Cruise. Spend your money elsewhere.

<Review>Awesome cruise! Smooth and relaxing! We had a big group with a number of kids and everyone was very happy. We enjoyed  watching the lake while it was still daylight and then sunset. Plenty of space on board. We didnt have dinner but drinks and icecream were very good. The Captain and crew members are very friendly, courteous and easy-going. Free parking and the cruise departed and returned right on time. 10/10 will do it again whenver we come back to Tahoe.

Tips: booking online has a fee. So call them to book your reservation to save some money.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80997d749abfaa73:0xc6a830880576eea5<//gmapID></record>

Warning!!! Don't order by phone because they will still make you wait in line to pay for your food. By then everything is cold. The reason people order by phone is to avoid the long lines.  Especially when you only have a 30 minute lunch. Worst part is a manager come out to argue and not take your money. Never coming here again! I'd pay more to else where!< /Text>

The food taste great (the best in town!) but the service is terrible. They get my order wrong 99% of the time and take forever. I make simple request, like no onions or no avocado and they ALWAYS mess up at least 1 item in my order or completely forget to give me one or more items from my order. My record wait was a few minutes shy of an hour. There's usually a wait of 30 minutes, even if they're empty.<//text>

Okay first of all,  great location by my house haha. Second,  I've tried almost everything on their menu and it's all been amazing. The lines and long, both inside and drive through but well worth the wait. Staff has always been great as well.<//Text>

This restaurant is my preferable restaurant.  Of all restaurants I know I love it most. I always suggests to my friends to go to visit this restaurant. Whenever  I feel like having a delicious meal, this place comes right away to my mind. good and diverse  food and a large list of dishes.trained team, and great ambience. In addition to that, the bill is fair. I praise this spot with great pleasure.<//Text>

The only reason this is three stars instead of four stars is that my fish was a little soggy. Fried fish should be crispy and this one was kind of soggy. Go with better tortillas and get the fish nice and crispy and hot and five stars<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<Text>We like to go for the weekday specials (different every day).  My favorite is the $1 fish taco Tuesdays.  This Alhambra location on Valley is small, but does have small dining areas both inside and outside.</Text>< time>

<review>This place has gone done in customer service,  seems like they hire managers with zero customer service skills. I used to go there every week on Tuesdays and order up to 100 tacos every time for work and I would kindly ask for everything on the side so they wouldn't get soggy, it was never a problem but the new manager is willing to loose customers by being rude and not wanting to satisfy customers needs.<//review><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80c2c5118c200607:0x13bdafa822b1f768</gmap_id>< date>

The fish was nice but the Baja has too much topping and sauce that overwhelm the whole taco. Everything could have been season a little better. Can't speak for anything else here but prob will go elsewhere for tacos.

Taste: 3/5
Service 4/5 the food came out fast
Parking: 5/5 plenty of free street parking
Price: 4/5 not the worst< /text>< GmapID>

<review>Wait for food was about 45 min.  Seems like they were prioritizing the drive thru. I ordered inside. The food was cold when i got it and honestly it wasn't all that good. Maybe $1 fish taco day is a better deal. At that price can't really complain for what you get.< /review>< Pics>

<time>1619074781749< /time><review>I went to this location on Tuesday with my boyfriend to try out the food since it seemed like a really good place to eat Mexican food at. We were completely wrong. We ordered online, there was a 35 minute wait for our food, which we did not mind. When the 35 minutes came by, I went into the store. I was not greeted by anyone so I went up to the girl who seems to be helping people with online orders. I told her that I was there to pick up food and gave her my name. She just kept looking at me and then stared at my phone. I asked her if she needed the email for confirmation and with attitude she said yes. She then wrote down my name and told me to wait outside. I waiting for 10 minutes after the 35 minutes I was required to wait. I went inside and since she was not around, I waited for her to come back. Before talking to her, the client she was talking to said he had been waiting for an hour already. I asked her "how much longer until I receive my order" and she just stared at me and nodded and walked away. Meanwhile she went to help another client to look for his order, he mentioned that he was waiting for an hour and 30 minutes which seems ridiculous for the fact that it was a pick up order and people in the drive thru and walking into the store were getting their orders faster. When I got my order, the quesadilla I ordered was no even cooked throughly. The cheese was not melted at all and was still chunky, also full of grease. I also ordered the tacitos and the plate was a mess. It did not even seem like an effort was made to put it together. We also ordered a surf and turf bowl which was missing the carne asada. The ceviche was leaking which made the tostadas soggy. This was one of my worse customer experiences at your location and they should properly  train their employees because our money is paying their bills.<//review>< Rate>

<Text>Reason I gave it 3 stars was because i did not like the cashier service... She was a bit rude, my husband does not speak Spanish and she would shut him in spanish telling him to wait because she was typing an order in.. I tried to tell her he did not speak spanish and she rudely told me the same thing again.. I do speak spanish. So maybe have a bilingual person who can address both language peaking cashier and they took long. But other than that food and drinks was on point. Only 1 handicap parking but can fit 2 cars side by side with  enough space. Handicap access all around too and also a drive through. Great spot will be going back again.</Text><response>None<//response><Name>Damaris Enriquez<//Name><date>1617143754576</date>< pictures>

Had there Fish and Chips. Disappointed the fish batter was soggie not crisp like others I've  had. Being a sea food restaurant I figured they would've been better. My daughter liked her asada tacos so it wasn't a total waste..</Text>

I rarely write reviews but this experience took the cake. I phoned in. The person taking orders was rude but I figured they were probably stressed. I made this call around 12:35. I was told to park and walk-in and it would be around 20-25 minutes. I was in no rush so I went in at 1. I paid at the front and was told to wait outside. I want to preface this next part with im pretty patient, probably to a fault. The people who walked in and ordered all got their food before me. All of the phone orders are taken to one of the front tables and you can see when they bring them out. I was a little frustrated at this point as I waited 45 minutes only for walk-in orders to be ahead of me. I went back inside to look at the finished orders as I had seen others do before. The cashier was extremely rude and told me to get out. I saw my name but I still exited as I didn't want to cause even more of a commotion. I waited another 15 minutes for the runner to come back to the front. She finally came out and I asked her about my order and she said oh its been here, she grabbed it for me and I left. It was about an hour and five minutes from phone order to getting my food. I hate to write this review because otherwise their food is amazing. It is the management here that seems horrendous and disorganized.< /text>

Delicious, has drive through that could accommodate bigger vehicles which is nice because I have a truck. Menu has a lot of options to choose from. They have deals also. Got the fish tacos which were a little soggy today but usually they're fried better. On the corner so you can see it easily. Has indoor and outdoor seating and salsas that you can get to add to the flavor. Give it a shot it's legit.</Text>

<review>This location is a JOKE! 0/10 stars, do not recommend!
Their staff is lacking major phone etiquette, which is imperative for take out orders.
Today, after waiting ten minutes on hold to place a phone order, they told me my order would be ready in 15 minutes.
I came in exactly at the 15 minute mark (I work next door so I make sure to take my lunch break once the food is ready.
My order was not ready. They asked me to wait outside (covid, I get it). Twenty minutes goes by and my food STILL isn't ready (I only get a 30 minute lunch break).
They don't apologize, nor offer anything to make it right. They just refund my money.
Then I look at the receipt they gave me, they charged me for someone else's order! I'd been waiting for food that wasn't even mine!
Mario was the one helping (if you could call it help) me. He was rude throughout the whole experience and didn't care that I had waited. Not once did he apologize. He did not read the order back to me when I originally paid, he just took my name and charged me.
After I realized that I was waiting for someone else's order I called the store to let them know. The manager (Jaime) listened to the whole situation. He never apologized. He told his employee that he needs to read the order back upon paying. The only thing he offered to make the situation right was to give me my meal for free. But my break already ended. I told him if I could have the free meal the next day that would be okay. He stated that it was a free meal right then and there or nothing at all.
Seriously? What a joke! And, to note, their food is decent at best.

0/10 stars. Do not recommend.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMk3ByFj80tftHM88UktK1M84ak0s83VWY9BHlR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< response>

The prices are good 3 tacos, fries and a drink for under $10. It does have very limited seating inside and out. You can park in the parking structure behind Edward's Theater.</Review>< Pics>

We had lunch here. We ordered fish and garlic fries. The crispy batter surrounding the fish was very good. The garlic fries has chopped chunks of garlic which was very tasty. It is a truck and not an actual restaurant. Seats were out door under umbrellas. Small area to sit and eat.</Review>

<Text>Fish tacos here are  OK.  What I really luv  are the shrimp burritos.  Unlike other place, they are not deep fry.  Most place use small shrimp with a ton of batter.  This place use large shrimp, you can't really taste them.

The lack of parking is a PITA.< /Text><username>Wilson Wong</username></record></dataset><record>

Yes the place has a taco Tuesday sale, but it’s very bad organized!!! Drive thru clients get there food way faster than walk in customers!! Waiting for over 15 min not one person has been called from the walk in but drive thru at least 6 cars have left... very bad organized it should take turns not all drive thru orders come out first!! Over 30 minute wait.. phone orders done and  sitting on the table waiting for clients to pick up!!< /review>

Incredible food.  Elevated Mexican food.  Flavor of carne asada and shrimp is great here.  My favorite is the shrimp burrito and Surf Turf Nachos.  Agua fresca is thee best as well.  Gotta try it.  Drive thru wait is 100% worth it.  Listen to some good music in the car while u wait, food will be amazing.</Text>

<rate>4< /rate><text>Tasty tacos in an unexpected place! I came to have tacos and meet with a friend. Not expecting much since I had never heard of this place, I was totally taken aback at how tasty their tacos were!

Parking seems limited but there is street parking available around. The area seems relatively safe, and there seems to be other businesses sharing the same parking lot.

The location is nice on a corner but seems to get a lot of traffic and so the outside and inside seating area is so-so clean, but the fish tacos make this place worth the visit. We were craving fish tacos so I ordered their baja Cali taco combo (comes with 2 🌮 with shrimp & fish) and it was fantastic. We ordered the ceviche which was quite generous but I did not try it though it looked tasty. I also ordered their fries which were 👍 and I enjoyed this place thoroughly! Highly recommended!</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlNNu_JoicBOHQQRUBw1gNeKSA_cUp1_Q4lh-s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnYba6DUZ2LpBBsLjza-2APyLFM_gFtA5Inr5b=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM86VNnjydO-uewqwgeIb25uMUmtN3KEoZSuWmk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5lQ7AyjFdfSZgMIpa90BOp75YIgQtojZ8YNFU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmEo8kslHXA2Bxf3x9WuNwWxnKgTjvuMZXRSwT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Resp>

Each time I place an advanced telephone order or order in person, there is always a long wait. Whether they are busy or not, average waiting period is a minimum of 20 minutes.

Keep in mind that all their proteins - whether it would be fish, carne asada, al pastor, or lengua are cooked in advance. All the cooks need to do is assemble these proteins for tacos, burritos, fries, etc.

So why the slow speed??? Both Alhambra locations are extremely slow despite my numerous complaints to the managers.

If you don't mind the lengthy wait or chaos at the restaurant, then Baja Cali is your place!< /review>

< Review>
I just had one of the worse experiences at this Baja Cali. I have been going to this place for more than a year with no complaints and loved the workers and the place. Tonight changed all that, I'm not sure what was up this lady's you know what but she was not friendly. I order 2 vegan Asada burritos in the drive thru. She stated  our order to us for 2 vegan Asada burritos and gave us the order. When we got home the order was wrong it was two tacos. So I went back to the place to try and get the burritos, no problem humans make mistakes and I wasn't going to create a problem. Instead I was met at the register with attitude, this lady said I repeated the order and said Asada tacos, with a really annoyed tone. Even though me and everyone in our car heard her say burritos. I then repeated to her, but that's not the order,  the receipt says the right order and you still proceeded to give us the wrong order. She just stared at me like it was my fault and never said anything. Why am I paying 30 dollars for this just to become furious at a worker who clearly can't keep her emotions in check? I walked out of there didnt say anything. I have been living in Alhambra for 2 years and have been frequenting this place with no problem. Baja Cali just lost my business for good. The food and the service was cold and dry. Since the cashier wants to give me attitude instead of admitting her fault, I will be taking my business elsewhere, you just lost a loyal customer. I don't need attitude when a guy is just tryna eat.<//Review>

Lots of people come for taco Tuesday but there's other specials throughout the week.  They got really good fish tacos as well as other types of tacos and burritos and quesadillas.  Been here at least half a dozen times already and has always been really tasty!<//text>

<text>My only concern about this location is the lack of attention to what a person is ordering. 5/10 times my order is incorrect and when they are corrected they get the "attitude" that they are bothered. That's why I only go when the manager is there, because the staff they have when she isn't there is very lazy in their customer service.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80c2c5118c200607:0x13bdafa822b1f768</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Food is good, service is lacking. They also put chili in everything so if you don't want spicy chili, let them know. My kid couldn't eat. When you try to call they disconnect the phone. It goes straight to voicemail & voicemail isn't set up.
I like their food but I do think twice before I order again.</Review>

Took about 15 min to get my items. The place has small but had a cool red and yellow theme going. The design and layout were modern and inviting. They have promotion from Monday thru Thursday every week! Tuesday is $1 fish tacos and Weds is $2 shrimp tacos. I ordered 2 fish tacos. They were piping hot and tasted awesome! The fish were cripsy with delicious topping sauce. The side stand had red onion, lime, and orange bell pepper. The tables had a good selection of hot sauce so you can keep every bite spicy! Will have to come back to try out more from the menu!< /review>< pictures>

<review>Really good fish tacos for the price! Rice and beans were OK, but I'd use the money for another taco instead.<//review>< pics>

its a new place. everything is clean. the tacos are smaller than i expected and its a bit on the pricey side, considering the neighborhood... shrimp cocktail is good, lots of shrimp and you add your own hotness/spice in. .plus one... but a little pricey too.</Text>

I AM A BIG FAN OF BAJA CALI ON MAIN STREET ALHAMBRA BUT THIS LOCATION IS CLOSER TO ME, I WENT ON A FRIDAY MORNING AND WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED, THE FOOD WAS GOOD BUT WE WERE ONE OF THE FIRST CUSTOMERS AND THE LADY WAS ON A BAD MOOD. THE TABLES STILL HAD STAINS OF FOOD FROM THE PREVIOUS DAY AND THERE WERE NO NAPKINS. I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS LOCATION.<//Text>

Fish tacos are pretty good, however, recently, we got some that tasted kinda fishy. We tried the vegan tacos and those were surprisingly good. The staff is always friendly and helpful.</text>

Searching for fish and chips for my grandfather! Was able to find this place. Ordered food online, which was really convenient. Stopped by the restaurant to pick up along the way for our family visit. The food was super fresh, especially the fish tacos and the fish and chips. I didn't realize the fish tacos were a standard spicy. If I knew that beforehand, I would have been able to change the order for the kids.<//text>

Always fresh and friggin delicious. One thing I'm not entirely happy with. When you order a plate order they should always include utensils when ordering through drive-thru or at least ask. Same with straws for drinks. I've reminded them on a couple of occasions only to find both missing from my order.< /Review>

The fish tacos are great. The barbacoa tacos are the best! There are about 4 decent parking spots in the back & 1 handicapped spot in the front. The street parking gets tough in the afternoon & on Taco Tuesday, it's worse. The menu has soup, ceviché, burritos... everything you want! Be prepared to wait because this place is popular. Indoor & outdoor patio seating available. I'm so glad this place is here!</Review>

I'm giving two stars because the food is actually very good.  That said, I'm done with this place because the service is so bad.

If you order ahead and they say 20 minutes, it doesn't matter when you show up.  They won't make your food until there are no other customers(maybe) or until after you arrive and pay(for sure).  They pretend your order is in, but it isn't at all.  After you pay, your order rolls out like everyone else's order.  They should stop pretending and stop faking phone orders!

They've also made errors on several orders of mine.  You call and they blame the cooks.  Sure if you drive all the way back they may attempt some sort of resolution, but the rate at which they make errors is super high.  They make excuses that they can't check every order... It's not my job to put a reliable process in place... I'm the customer and I like getting what I order, especially when it's a To-go order.</text>

They prioritize the drive thru and if you walk in like I did they make you wait longer than they should. So expect to wait over 40 minutes. No bueno!</review>

Super inefficient. 3 people in front of me takes 15+ minutes but why?? It makes no sense that they could be so slow, especially if you look at the reviews.

I'm convinced they offer free food if you leave a 5 star review. Don't fall for it<//review>

< Review>
The food is really good so far. Ive tried almost everything on the menu. Tacos (every protein), nachos/fries, burritos. The bad and I mean really bad, is the long line. Drive-through and walk up. Even if you called in your order 30 mins ahead, you'd still have to wait an additional 30 mins to receive your order.  The wait is worth it but I hate waiting so long for whats considered to be fast food. Compared to Chick-fil-A and In-n-Out, this place takes the cake on the longest line.< /Review>

Great Mexican seafood, high end restaurant flavor at a good price. Fish tacos here, you cant go wrong. They're delicious. I haven't tried there soups, but ive seen others eat it, and it looks so good. I even tried there non sea food foods, like carnitas burrito, nachos, tacos, and they all taste great!!!
So rare to find a place where all the foods taste good. Only down side is its small, recommend eating on the outside patio.<//text>

Been in here a few times and have been happy with the quality of the food. Fresh and good tasting for fast food. Vegan options are great for those in the family who are not carnivores but want to enjoy meals together. Seafood was good. Small dining area indoors with a larger outdoor area. My only issue was the need for table and chair cleanliness in the outdoor patio. Definitely coming back when that taco craving hits. Fair prices and they have a kids menu.</Text>

Simple menu, great food. Great folks running the place. Pricing is good and fair. Parking on the other hand is a bit wonky.

Well everything was great except for the order of French fries that was placed same time as my other items,she even called it out "papitas".
I picked up the order  the fries weren't there so she said "it will take a little time, well initial order8:57 pm went back a second  time 9:30 pm. The fries weren't even cooking!!:(
The cook motioned didn't know ,so i cancelled my order.
That was  NOT good customer service.
SHE DID RETURN MY MONEY.THANK YOU
MANAGEMENT HAS TO BE MORE ASTUTE  WITH THE CUSTOMERS ORDERS..
I WILL RETURN BUT NOT SOON........</Review>

There is no social distance... as they let people get to close to each other and the cookers are wearing mask but they dont cover all the way.... by the way this is order #89 5/5/20.... They put deliver and phone orders in front of stand....I was there for an hour and had a full room of people  breathing on me.</Review>

This restaurant has amazing fish tacos! They taste authentic and are priced fairly. On tuesdays they are sold for only 99 cents a taco! The lines can get really long, especially around lunch and dinner time so if you plan on going on a Tuesday, arrive early or be prepared to wait. They are so delicious however that it’s definitely worth it!<//Review>

< Review>
I've tried the aguachiles tostada, fish tacos, carne asada tacos, chicken tacos, potatoe tacos, shrimp cocktail, asada sope, chicken sope, horchata, and cucumber water. I love the fish tacos the best. Their meat isn't lean, so if you don't like eating fat, you'll have to pick it out of your food like I do. If you like spicy foods try the aguachiles and get that cucumber water with mint and chia seeds. It's the most refreshing drink! A good meatless option are the potatoe tacos, they're delicious.
If you go on a Tuesday, the line goes all the way outside and it was way too crowded to eat inside because the fish tacos are 99cents each. On Thursdays the meat tacos are 99cents each.

*UPDATE* Feb 2018
I recently also tried the barbacoa tacos, piña agua fresca and strawberry agua fresca. All three were really good.  I gave it another go with the carne asada and chicken and ordered sopes but their meat still isn't clean so I couldn't eat 80% of it. I even ASK before ordering if their meat has "cuero". The cashier thought I meant skin and had me ask one of the cooks and he said it was clean (but it wasn't like always) -.- so I'll stick to the fish tacos and barbacoa!

*UPDATE* March 2018
Extremely lean meat in my sope!!! I ordered a carne asada sope and I FINALLY got no fat with my meat, it was delicious! I hope they keep it up!!!</Review>

Great food right next to the movie theater. Fish tacos are great and so is the surf and turf burrito.  The only downside is you can only drink your alcoholic beverages inside and not on the patio.<//Review>

Sooo excited this place opened up! Fish tacos are inexpensive, big & delicious. Not to mention those (free) yummy yellow peppers. If you're in the area & love fish tacos then you gotta stop here. Be aware that lunch hours get very busy. You'll leave satisfied 😌<//Review>

The perfect place in my book. It's a Hole In The Wall, Mom & Pop, easy on the wallet and the icing on the cake, serves great food. Their regularly priced menu is affordable. But you can't beat the Tuesday & Thursday taco specials. Tuesday fish tacos. Thursday meat tacos. I'm so glad my wife found this place on yelp. Oh yeah, the service is friendly.

Discovered the perfect time to avoid the lines. Just get there before 5pm. If ya gotta wait, it's still worth it.</Text>

I ordered fish and chips to go. The fries were soggy and they forgot to give me the fish. I paid the price for a full meal to get soggy half cooked fries. No longer a fan. I'm not going back unless I get a response with a credit for a free plate of fish and chips. Keep ripping off your customers if you don't want any business. I'm redirecting people I know elsewhere in the future.<//Text>

<Review>Found this place just passing by.
What a great find!
Friends tried the surf and turf burrito and regular tacos.  I had the barbacoa tacos and a dope.
Washed it all down with some agua frescas.
I've recommended this place to a vegan friend of mine, since they do have a vegan menu. Waiting to see what they thought.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80c2c5118c200607:0x13bdafa822b1f768< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Tasty food options, great prices.  Parking is a bit rough and they are always busy, but that's a good thing!  Definitely a good go to spot for lunch.</text>

Decent taste. Bad slow service. Orders take WAY TO LONG. 45 minute wait for tacos? Cmon. They need to find a way to get the orders out faster.<//text>

< Review>
I was visiting my son. He said he had recently discovered a new place for fish tacos. I have been there only once, but I will go back. The tacos were great!!! The restaurant is very small, but clean. No atmosphere to speak of. Food is inexpensive,  but very tasteful. I will go back when in the area again.< /Review>

$1 Fish Taco Tuesdays... $1 Meat Taco Thursdays... Yummy!! And regardless of coming here on either a Tuesday or a Thursday the tacos are good and at a good cost too. Their fish tacos are definitely huge and a big portion; I tend to only be able to eat 2-3 of their fish tacos. But so worth.< /Text>

<Text>This little place has become one of our favorite "to go" places for a quick or not so quick because its always packed lol drive thru places we just love. We always get the fish and shrimp tacos and my favorite when they have it fresh watermellon drink.  Whatever you're in the mood whether it's carnitas, carne asada tacos or a combo surf n turf burrito you cant go wrong.  I will heed a bit of warning the sauce they put on is a bit too spicy for me so I just ask for no chili sauce and its just perfect.

<text>I only go to this place on Tuesday for the fish tacos.  Freaking amazing.  You can order ahead by phone which I highly suggest but be forewarned the lines are long during the lunch rush.  This is a popular spot.  Hot sauces are on points and the condiments bar has everything essential for a great taco spot.< /text><UserId.>107704081136562472328<//UserId.>< time>

The order arrived promptly but it was cold and had bits of meat, no guacamole. The nachos I ordered doesn't come with meat (I'm vegetarian, didn't want meat). I DON'T blame the Postmates delivery man at all. He picked up the order and delivered it right away. The restaurant made the mistake. The only reason I gave 2 stars was for the wonderful cucumber drink. Absolutely delicious.</text><pics>None</pics>< response>

Great food! But have a website menu& phone number to order BUT DONT ANSWER & have full voicemail! This is not US customer service. Get another line & or worker to handle that. When we go, we like the food, but way slow & obviously not enough employees at high volume times.< /Text>

Bad customer service! The lady (cashier) really disgusting attitude 🤮😠. It was my first time there but never going back again. I give 2 stars only because they have vegan tacos.  But lady please you need to be educated how to welcome customers🤨🤨.</Review>

This place is better for fish tacos than Rubio's. It is quickly becoming a local gem. Alhambra needed a place like this where you can get yummy Mexican food in a hip little locale with outdoor seating. It's near Valley/Fremont where the old drive thru donut shop used to be located.

It's suppose to be fast food but the crowd what makes it take long. This place is so popular during lunch time that there is a line out the door but well worth it!< /Text>

Our go-to place for fish tacos and ceviche now. There is a branch on Main Street, but we haven't tried it yet. Good eats. Kids eat free on Wednesdays with minimum $10 purchase.<//text>

<review>If you are a fan of Tacos Baja in East Los Angeles, then you will love these tacos. Hits very close to home and has the chilis as well. Encourage to give it a try
-limited parking
-long lines
-small venue
-very limited seating
-great fish tacos
- everything tasted very fresh.
DRIVE THROUGH IS HORRIBLE.
they need to speed it up.
Call in it gets packed</review>< pics>

I normally go on Tuesdays, but wanted to try the meat Thursdays. For being right after July 4th, and no one barely there I waited over a half an hour for four tacos. Also as other people that ordered after received their food much quicker. Great on Tuesdays, but I'll have to pass at that locale for Thursday dinner.</text>

<Review>Slow and so not worth the wait! 20 minutes for a veggie burrito, which is a tortilla loaded up with premade stuff. And the rice was bland and overcooked, the beans were bland, and there was so little pico in there most bites you couldn't taste it. Avoid this place!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Very delicious, and they do have grilled options.  From the pics, everything looks battered and fried, but the fish and shrimp are available grilled for $0.50 more.</review>

<Review>Fish and shrimp tacos are really good, haven't tried their other meats because I only come here for seafood. Their ceviche tostadas are really good too especially the shrimp and they aren't stingy with the serving. My go to order is 2 fish tacos and a shrimp ceviche tostada perfect pair! Oh parking here sucks if you're going during a busy time (lunch).< /Review></record>

Apparently know when you ask for Chiles they throw on your face that they are free and could only give you 3 when you buy 11 tacos. Asked Mariah for a manager and she stated that the manager was not there. Maybe you need to put price for the extra Chile’s instead of throwing it on customers that they are free. Which I only asked for 3 extra.<//review>

Went there for their Fish Taco Teusday recently. They were very busy, with a line going out their door. Despite all of that I got my food relatively quickly and it was great.<//Review>

Fish tacos for $0.99 on Tuesday. Wait times for your order can be long, but usually worth the wait time.< /Text>

This taco place WAS the best when they first opened but now the quality of the food has declined I have experienced on several occasions the food is just warm,  salty, tortillas are hard on the edge,  the tortas...had pieces of paper, fish tacos were salty and almost cold.<//Text>

<Text>I only ever come on $1 fish taco tuesdays so i can only speak from those experiences. Fish tacos are good but they sometimes skimp out on the cabbage. They have a self-serve section including radishes, seasoned chilis, limes, and pickled red onion. Everytime i have gone there, there is always an item missing. Maybe its just cuz its constantly busy on Tuesdays. Another problem i have with this place is they are not at all accurate with the estimated time for phone orders. I ALWAYS need to add an extra 20 min to whatever time they give me.<//Text>< Pictures>

Awesome Mexican food! They started offering vegan options and on Monday's they have $1 off vegan tacos so I had to try some. I had the vegan carne asada and vegan chicken. I liked the 'chicken'! The vegan carne asada was a little dry. Maybe they overcooked it? They also have barbacoa and el pastor. I'll have to try those next time. Btw, I'm not vegan. I'm making a conscious effort to eat less meat when I can. I'm glad to see many places offering vegan options. My kiddo is a vegetarian so that also influenced me to eat less meat. :)
I've also have had their carne asada, fish, and chicken tacos, and the tostadas, and they are all good! Tostada was my fave (carne asada). They have different deals on each day during the weekday.<//review>

For some screamin' good fish tacos, drive to Baja Cali! My husband and son could NOT stop raving about this new spot and its fish tacos! They made me vegan tostadas that we're crispy, fresh and delicious. Great prices too! The Pasadena location is opening next weekend. Fantastic food for catering as well!<//text>

Food is good but the lines are ridiculous. Whats the sense of calling ahead and ordering for pickup. I arrived and couldn't even get to the cashier cause there was no line for calls..some were getting upset being cut off by others that were ordering by phone...My suggestion to avoid customers getting into an actual fight in the future.  Create a second line parallel with the ones waiting in line and alternate the customers at the cashier. Food is great but needs work on organization of service.< /review>

Fish and shrimp tacos are good.  The other meats are eh.  The Al Pastor does not have the traditional taste nor does it resemble it.  I had to verify that it was al pastor.  They had a crowd waiting to order.  Got my order wrong.  Their aguas frescas were extra sweet.  Street parking.< /text>

I WAS FIRST AND LINE, AND THEY TOOK TWO PARTIES ORDERS BEFORE MINE. I just left this establishment and you can bet i won't come back. Check the cameras 824 is when I left. The cashier didn't even acknowledge my existence. Ridiculous. I was literally the only person in the store in line. GREAT CUSTOMER CARE.< /Review>

Waited 25-30 minutes in the Drive-Thru. There were only 2 cars in front of me. I ordered eight fish tacos with no Crema.
Rosa who took my order said I cannot make any changes at the drive-thru window everything was as is. All I asked for was no Crema she said she had to get the manager slash owner he said that he would do it one time only. He was not nice, he was arrogant and as he was walking away I told him thank you and he turned around and looked at me and said what did you say and I said thank you.. Rosa said after waiting the half hour/ 25 minutes in line that I would have to walk in if I didn't want any crema on the fish tacos. Very very rude. Won't go there again. There's too many other places to go where the food is just as good and better then there. I didn't ask for anything special I just didn't want the crema on fish tacos. How hard is that to do? Then to have to call the manager to get an okay NOT to add something on it. Totally ridiculous. Those 2 people were very rude to me and didn't show any kind of caring or respect. We as customers sign their paychecks not the boss not the owner but us as customers sign their paychecks. Without us they wouldn't have a job.</text>

<review>First time and last time I went there the cashier was so rude. I started asking her questions about the menu and then some guy came up from behind me. She then started to converse with him and then told me to wait while she went to the back kitchen somewhere. I was hungry and trying to get help on what to order and couldn't believe that I was told to hold my thoughts after wanting to try this place out for months... Umph especially that the shop was completely empty at the moment. I just left. I guess they must have not cared to make money that day?< /review>< Time>

We have been twice and the food is awesome and very well priced.  Today was our second trip and the place was packed.  The owner saw me walking out and asked if I ordered, I said I didn't realize today was cash only so didn't have enough money.  He said no worries, took my order for 20 fish tacos and said bring back cash for pick up so I didn't have to stand in line again.  Anyway, 5 stars for food and great service.  And hey if you guys need a good accounting service let us know!  Briglio and Cheung!< /Text>

<Review>The last three times I've been here they didn't have potato tacos. How can you be out of something so consistently? Just order more potatoes! You also can't get certain items through the drive thru like grilled shrimp or fish which is just plain stupid. The whole drive thru sucks, you can't even order until you get to the window then you have to wait for your food. Avoid the dive thru and just go inside. The food quality has also gone down since they opened every time I get my order now its a sloppy gross mess in a box I had to eat my tacos with a fork last 2 times I went.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

It was a limited menu but the fish tacos and campechana were amazing.  Definitely going back to try full menu.
Small location, limited parking onsite but street parking available.< /Review>

So happy they came to Pasadena. I had been going to the one in Alhambra whenever I'm at school, CSULA. When I saw the sign in my own city I was ecstatic about having the homemade horchata at my disposal. Obviously the fish tacos are amazing but the El Pastor is amaaazing too. Plus, how could you pass the yellow chiles with their special powder seasoning. I can never get enough. See you guys soon!!! Next on my list is trying the carne asada fries or the Chile relleno burrito!<//review>

<Review>Visited Baja Cali Fish &Tacos for lunch ,order a shrimp burrito .This shrimp burrito did not have the flavor i expected it needs some flavor on the breaded shrimp and a flavorish sauce in order to make it good ,i think is overpriced .on the customer service side its aweful employees  here need to have sense of customer service ,you have to understand that people humans get grouchy when we hungry and a bad attitude from an employee could set them off and not enjoy their food .i had no problems with them cause i always have a smile in my face for everybody :).</Review></record></dataset><record>

Baja Cali F & T offers good authentic Mexican food. Their fish 🐟 tacos are deliciously fresh; your taste buds would definitely crave for. Similarly, their burrito (barbacoa) is particularly good not to mention the agua frescas. Staff are nice, competent and friendly. Indoor and outdoor seating is neat and organized. Parking lot is very very limited albeit nearby street parking is available. Prices are relatively affordable and it won't break your 💰wallet. Overall, I give it ☆☆☆☆ food/drinks and ☆ parking space.</Text>

We had fish tacos, asada tacos, fish and shrimp burrito, fish ceviche tostada. Everything was so good. I highly recommend this spot. New to Alhambra, it's nice having a fish taco spot that actually has good tacos. Can't wait to go back!< /Review>

<Text>Had dinner on Friday night with my husband. I ordered 2 shrimp tacos, and a small shrimp cocktail. The shrimp tacos were good. The shrimp cocktail, had no flavor, didn’t taste fresh. The tomatoes, onion and cilantro, tasted like they had come out of a jar 😒 Husband has a shrimp ceviche tostada. He said it was good. He also had an aguachile tostada. I have to say, it was the worst aguachile we’ve ever had. The shrimp was cooked in water, not lemon, even tho I asked the cashier and she confirmed it was cooked in lemon😑 the sauce had no chilie, it was a green sauce with a lot of black pepper. & the tostada has nothing but red onions 😩 the plate was so heavy, and it was just onion!!</Text></record></dataset><record>

Love the fish shrimp tacos there canpechana delicious but the service from the older lady I forget her name is not to good rude most of the time and if you go to the drive thru if she is in a good mood she will take your order from the menu out side if not she will tell you need to go inside to order maybe after waiting along time..but other then that I still go just for there fish tacos</Text>

Decent food, that is comparable with other local options but nothing stand out amazing.

The venue is very small, street parking is a must, and the wait is very long.<//text>

Very tasty, reasonably cheap fish tacos.Nicely fried, flavorful, with tasty sides and sauce.  It seems like they have dollar fish tacos on Tuesday which I will for sure be coming back for.
I found that other items on the menu were closer to average. The pastor and carne asada tacos I had were both relatively tasty, but the meat itself didn't seem to be of great quality. The "crab" ceviche is actually made of imitation crab(I should have known from the cheap price). The strawberry agua fresca is delicious and not too sweet. Their condiment and sides bar is extensive, with radishes, onions, and large banana peppers available.

The service is just okay, and we had to wait a decent amount of time for our food.

Overall I would definitely come back and probably just order the fish tacos.</text>

So i ordered 2 fish tacos and 1 shrimp taco. The next day i woke with intoxication issues. Idk if the fish they gave me was too old or sitting out 2 long but it was bad. 👎👎 thumbs down for me.< /Review>

A Restaurant I've Supported for Years comes to a End. I spent $40 on Fish Tacos and asked for Condiments and got additiude from the Monitor gal. I asked for Sour Cream on the Side with my order from the start, I Checked my order and I got No Sour Cream, Gave me 1 Soggy Bottom chilli and Onion baggy. I asked nicely if there were any more to cover for large order, I got excuses additiude and was told to wait outside which I gladly wanted to for there were people without mask waiting in the dining area. My wife and I will Never Go there. Not Worth the Stress Disrespectful Additiude and Money,  Adios Baja Cali Fish Tacos.</text>
