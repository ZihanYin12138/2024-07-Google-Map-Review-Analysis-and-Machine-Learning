A spot that I have been going to for years now that hasn't ever failed me. There is a lot of delicious food items that would take you a while to try them all. The price isn't too bad as one plate would be enough to fill an average human. I do recommend this place as a go to Chinese restaurant.<//text>

The food was really good! GenTso Chicken was like no other! It was made with real white chicken meat, and not over breaded. Their water has fresh lemon and strawberries in it, yes, it was amazing. I will be back for my own birthday some day. :)</review>

<text>Ordered some egg flour soup, figured you can't mess that up. DISGUSTING. No flavor except for the TOMATOES. YES I said TOMATOES in egg flour soup. It was utterly horrible. Will never eat here again. Waited an hour for my delivery and paid 16 dollars for some soup that I threw in the trash. Wish I could get my money back. SO UPSET< /text>< Pics>

Absolutely delicious.  I honestly have to say the best quality Chinese food I've had.  We ordered orange chicken and general chicken.  The quality of chicken is perfectly crispy and flavored and I love that it was pure clean chicken breast. The fried rice and chow man are to die for!!! Highly recommend.< /text>

Some of the best Chinese food I've had in a long time. Very unique flavors and spectacular presentation. Try the honey walnut prawns. You'll thank me later.</review>

My husband and I are regulars - they know us so well here they memorized our order so we never have to say anything!  The service is fast and everyone is really nice.  We always get our favorites - Sizzling Rice Soup, Kung Pao Beef and Sweet and Sour Chicken. The food is always quick, consistent and great tasting. I highly recommend this spot for dining and takeout!< /Text>

< Review>
I visited this restaurant recently and there was no customers there, soon I realized why. The waitress was brief in her interactions and was not pleasant. It seemed more important to the waitress to chat with her coworker than to attend to the one set of customers they had. Waitress was not inviting nor quick. My wife and I both ordered and my food came out before hers. Eight to ten minutes apart from each other. When we received our food it did not taste good. Mine was cold and my wife’s pot stickers were dough-y. And lacking in flavor. When brought to the attention of the waitress that after one bite else wished not to continue with the meal, she expected us to pay for a meal that had not been consumed.<//Review>

We really enjoyed the food here it was really good & seemed fresh. I would definitely recommend it & we will be returning when we crave some good Chinese food. However, We ordered one order of shrimp Chow mein & one of pork fried rice & an order of egg rolls & that was 30 dollars. It was worth it though.<//Text>

Ordered ahead of time over the phone and when I arrived to pay and pick up my order, i had to wait an additional 10 minutes (was told to pick up in 10 minutes) and the food was undercooked which made it kind of gross. I only ordered the stir fry too...<//Review>

What can I say, I love this restaurant.  The food is excellent, it always tastes fresh, and it's always served hot.  The soups are perfect on a cold night.  If you like well made Chinese food, don't hesitate to stop in for a great meal.</Text>

Horrible service. I was given a price verbally when I can obviously see the menu. After I assured the waitress I could see the prices she brought me the bill before my food even came out. Everyone else's bill came out after they finished eating. SMH.<//review>

We really enjoyed the food,  very tasty.  The service was excellent.  The quality of the food is excellent.  The waitress was very helpful with suggestions of very tasty dishes.  We could also order dishes not on the menu such as "Chinese Broccoli with Hoisin Sauce",  one of our favorites usually not on the menu at most Chinese restaurants.  We also found the prices  reasonable for the quality and quantity of the food.  We will be returning. Also, the one bad review was because the restaurant only had canned soda and didn't offer refills. I don't go to a good Chinese restaurant to drink soda. They give you all the  tea and water you want.</review>

They put celery and bok choy in the war wanton soup, I have eaten war wonton soup my entire life and none of the asian restaurants I have dined at have put those vegetables in the soup. The sushi tasted old and the rice was soggy. I would not return.< /review>

Most chinese restaurants I've been to, you would expect your entree in a simple platter. Not this place.  I ordered the Dragon and Phoenix and expected just that but these folks went all out to make an art show with their presentation.  The food is great, prices are appropriate and wait times are minimal. Their "dinner for one" option is perfectly portioned so that you can eat half of the entree and be satisfied while bringing the rest home for a second bite. Bottom line, I like this place and will come by more often.<//Text>

Their lunch specials are the best priced around. Their food is even better than anyone around this area. They are quick and even give you the real hot mustard now the packets.</review>

Has to be best Chinese food in the area.   Have tried many in the last 7 years.  Great chef here.  Family likes to order sea bass a few days in advance.   It is spectacular.<//review>

Came here for a birthday lunch for a coworker.....its still pretty good.
I got the fried rice of the week lunch special(forgot the name of it).....it was ok, but I asked for the spice tray to add some spicyness and a extra flavor boost!  Good amount of shrimp and good portion, everyone enjoyed their lunches.< /review>

<review>I went for lunch for the first time yesterday and here is my review:

-The place was very clean
-The server was friendly but didn't seem to know much
-I ordered MuShu Chicken, it was just okay at best
-I ordered a lunch special to take home with me and IT WAS DELICIOUS!!  It was Chicken with Mixed Vegetables.
I'm definitely going back!<//review><pics>None<//pics><time>1483111124658< /time><UserId.>113697145625665939317< /UserId.><response>None</response><GmapID>0x809ad6e3234642c5:0xc552903106cb9aeb<//GmapID></record>

This place must only be good for Dine in only, I order Walnut shrimp to go on their lunch menu w/fried rice and It was disgusting to put it in a nice way the fried rice was white white drizzled in Soy Sauce and the walnut shrimp batter was hard and chewy. The cream cheese wontons on the side where over done. Worse take out I had in a long time</Text>

I wish there were more Chinese restaurants like this. Their food always tastes very fresh with amazing rich flavors. Every place I have gone to in Sacramento has been compared to this and not one stands up.<//Text>

Very good in the quality in food, and the service we get there every time is excellent. And not too many Chinese food restaurant's are MSG free but they are, which makes it great for my father-in-law who can't have MSG.<//text>

Boy was I wrong to do so first I was meet by a boy at the counter no hello !or how may I serve you !just a cocky attitude like I should be lucky to be in hes presents. A I orderd the Mandarin chicken rice and war won ton soup it came rather quickly and payd $22.25 for a one person serving .Got it home with in 5 minute first the soup there was two little shrimps on the very bottom of the container that look like they where rejected from a shrimp cannery. When I put one in my mouth the texture was like eating a oyster I could feel and hear the sound if sand crunching in my teeth the chicken at least that what I thank it was was tasteless looked like it had been over boild. The pork was hard and the vegetables although green and colorful was again tasteless.properly made yesterday and was siting in a pot on a low simmer all day well then came the chicken lets just say I would of been better off eating the Styrofoam container it came in ! It tested like soy source thats it. And the chicken was dry. I gave it to my dog and he did int even eat it.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x809ad6e3234642c5:0xc552903106cb9aeb< /gmap_id></record>

I'm not too sure about this place they ask you for ID just to use the ATM card I never experienced nothing like that use my ATM card and if you do a late-night order before closing I got some bad chicken that I had to return I won't do any more shopping there if they going to ask you for ID to use ATM card<//review>

I LOVE this place and have been going there for almost 10 yrs. Always clean. People working there seem happy and care about their work. It's good to have an appointment but I also drop in. Sprouts next door in case u to wait a few min.</Review>

was very excited to try out this nail salon, only to be let down. the service was great, but the performance wasn’t. super disappointing. then they charge you an extra $10 for gel, which you HAVE to get, because otherwise the regular polish is trashy, blotchy, and poorly drying time. i was told to be careful and let them dry, so i thought using air from my car AC would be okay, wrong. the polish dried, but in a blotchy bubbly pattern. will never go here again 👎🏼): sad because the service is so nice<//Text>

Stopped in today as a walk-in and was seating right away. I got a manicure and gel polish done (solid white), and I love the way it came out. Jennie did my nails and she was very careful the whole time. She cut my cuticles very well and the got the color all around the nail very neatly. Will definitely be returning.<//review>

< review>
I came in today with an appointment at 1pm with my daughter.  She was getting a Mani/pedi and I was scheduled for a full set.

They took my daughter to a chair right away.   I waited for 10 min then 20. At chick time a bridal
Party came in and demanded to Be seated saying they also had appointments.

They proceeded to make comments about not being helped and asked repeatedly be served. they also loudly read names of other salons
they could go to instead.  To the point where I was skipped over so the could be accommodated.

I was ready to leave after my daughter was done and just forget my nails. Before she was done at 150 with my daughters mani/pedi, they called me back to have my nails done

I decided to have my daughter sit and wait for me to get my set.  She started to sand down my nails.  At 1:57 she set down the tool and said “sorry but I need you to move and wait a while because I have another appointment that just walked in and I need to take them ”.

I said.

I had an appointment at 1pm and it was is now 2:00 pm, my nails are sanded down, and I now I have to wait more?
So I was SOL?!   She asked if someone else would take me. They all had new customers (bridal party) and wouldn’t-couldn’t.

So I paid for my daughters nails and left.

I couldn’t believe the lack of respect of
people’s time and to just stop mid service and kick me out of the chair.

I was never rude, I didn’t say a word negative about anything.  I was polite and kind the entire time.  Then I basically left in tears because I was so frustrated to have much time used and no results.  Not worth tears I know. But I was very frustrated and had no recourse.

I will never ever return.   If you make an appointment there out doesn’t matter, unless
you make one with a certain person. Then they will kick people out of the chair mid service to help you!

I would understand if I was a walk in but I called ahead an hour in
Advance and asked what was the best time for the service I required.   THEY TOLD ME the time to come in.

Don’t offer appointments if you can’t honor the time.

Also. Someone’s child had their iPad playing a movie and too volume for the entire room to “enjoy”. Which they can control but that is rude! Public service announcement!</review>

<Text>I'm very sad to leave such a bad review because every time I have come here. It has been fast and wonderful nails. The staff has always been amazing but today really made me think twice about coming again. I got there at 10am on Wenesday seemed a little busy so I know there would be a little wait. I ended up waiting an hour and half before even sitting in a chair to be helped. I waited another 5 mins waiting for someone to start my nails by than I was out of patience and had to leave. During the time I waited 4 woman had be helped and finished there pedicures ( they all came in after me) all I wanted was a full set French tip. I left at 1130 without my nails done and disappointed in the shop. The nails are wonderful and staff is too but you should really tell customers if they are going to wait more than an hour and half on services by them.</Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<text>Honestly don't know what happened. Last time I went in everything was exceptional! This past week I went in with my mom and I got plain white full set acrylics. A middle aged man did them. Terrible shaping, cut me twice, and you can see small holes in my nails because he filed and drilled way too much! I really don't want to come back but if I do, definitely don't want him again.
.
UPDATE... Iwent back in and they redid them. This is the service I remember! Thank you again.</text><rate>5<//rate></record></dataset><record>

Just made my first visit and had Ashley do my nails. Acrylic full set with gel color...she was great! I am so happy. I have found my manicurist!! She listened to what I wanted and delivered.</review>

The vibe is ok, pretty relaxed. I rated this place  a 3 because the staff doesn't really seem to care. They are just doing their jobs, minimally, kind of a blah attitude. Cordial but just robotic. That's ok for a 3 minute wax but an hour or more with that attitude is kinda weird. Oh I forgot I had to go back 2 days after my fill bc 2 nails broke... just not the place for me for long term service. My pedicure was subpar. Like "2 scrubs here and 2 scrubs there" no checking to see if rough areas were even smooth.< /Text></record>

They did partially good, the reason why I’m giving them 2 stars is because the older guy was working on my girlfriend’s nails and stopped working on her nails to start on another customers nails who was 25-30 minutes late to her appointment. To me that was very unprofessional.</review>

<text>I’ve tried to give this salon many many chances, I’ve been there a total of 4 times and each time is horrible. I’ve gotten a full set twice and two fills and they always fall before the 2 weeks, they do them way to thick and uneven. I had one nail and inch longer than the rest. Really disappointing.< /text><name>Priscila Soto</name><gmapID>0x80db7f580652f6c1:0xc138d391b07524ca<//gmapID>< user>

Do not get acrylics here!! Got them done and she made them all different sizes and shapes I had to file some myself to make them decent, the acrylic was lumpy. They all came popped off in 3 days.. And she was so nervous with the drill! Will not be returning!</Review>

Average Chipotle in Valley Fair. The quality of your food depends on the days servers. Some carefully construct your order while others can just throw it together with the proportions all wrong. It helps if you watch and tell them how much of each ingredient you want before they do it themselves</Text>

News flash: a burrito should not be folded like a piece of paper and the aluminum should COVER it.

Honestly the only reason I give any stars at all is for the happy blonde guy that's always there. I have yet to ask his name but youd know exactly who it is if you saw him. He's got this everlasting happy attitude and he creates an entire experience in the one-minute encounter you have with him

It was 4 minutes til opening and they wouldn't serve me, all of the food courts in the mall appreciate their customers and I saw everyone else eating else where, I hope saving 4 minutes was worth losing a customer. I chose somewhere else because as a business owner, I don't turn away polite customers, but this Chipotle, the employees are just standing around now trying to look busy.<//text>

The staff didn't pay attention to the food when preparing. The wrap was not well done, quesadillas needs to be peeled from the foil to eat.<//review>

Absolutely disappointed in the quality and customer service.

The value for the cost was not justifiable.

I waited in line for at least 30 minutes and my favorite side, guacamole was gone. The prep should have been made in the wait time of placing my order.

I was advised that they were making it and it would be another 20 minutes.

I asked if I could have a few slices of avocado but was told that it’s not an option.

Truly, this was the worst Chipotle service of my life!

Totally unsatisfied in the food and experience.</review>

Must see! Check out the amazing views from the free observatory. Gray place to bike and enjoy. Beautiful gardens and surroundings. Lots of museums packed into a smaller area. Lots to see, enjoy and do.</Review>

< review>
This is a wonderful neighborhood Park that makes the Diamond Heights community so speciaĺ. It's a quick 2 or 3 minutes jog from my home but it usually takes me 10 minutes. The place  has a children's playground with a large central grassy green with baseball diamond at one side. Also, there're tennis courts hidden in another side. There is a paved path around the green. It about 1/4 mile long. It is also home to Billy Goat Pre-school, a co-op school, a great neighborhood asset<//review>

<Review>A hidden gem in San Francisco which is next to the Safeway shopping center on Diamond Heights Blvd. Nice kiddy playground with real sand and not rubber mats! Large grass lawn area and a softball diamond with fence backdrop are still very nice.
Great place to walk your dogs, but be very careful at dusk time because coyotes do frequent this area at night, and they will take a small dog if given the opportunity.
WATCH YOUR PET WHEN IT STARTS TO GET EVENING TIME, OR BEFORE.< /Review><Date>1558338306978</Date></record></dataset><record>

Decent playground for older children, I guess. I took my two year old nephew here, and it feels like a death trap. Everything is so tall, with no guard rails or anything. Luckily, he mainly looked the swings. There's just enough people walking by as we stand there for summer good visual diversity. He loves pointing at dogs that walk by and telling me the color.
Anyway, I feel like it's a dangerous playground, but your kids might like it</text>

<Review>This park has a play structure and some sand for kids to run around on, however I don't think it's the best atmosphere for kids. Better for walking your dog or enjoying a morning cigarette in the heavy fog that lingers here most nice mornings.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Christopher playground is something of a disappointing wreck.  It's great to have a close neighborhood playground but the age, state of repair and general safety of the structures leave an lot to be desired.  The sign warning of arsenic based wood treatment Bernie beneigth the peeling green paint is particularly special...<//Review>

What a nice park, well kept,  wonderful views, very well educated people,  is a delight to walk or just seat on a bench and see the dogs running, kids playing,  believe me,  is a place where people still say hello to strangers .< /text>

Oh. One of the few "old school" playgrounds left in San Francisco. Yes Kids, this is how most of the playgrounds in SF were, with sand and treated timber and metal slides. This place brought me back in time, kinda.<//text>

(Translated by Google) They have left a lot of fine stone and the children water it, the games are a bit dangerous.

This was the third or forth time that I use their services and not once was I disappointed. I've been assisted by two different drivers but each of them have always been professional and very respectful and not once have they made us feel uncomfortable in any way. I appreciate how well they handled each situation and overall made it a fast process on every occasion that I had an emergency.< /Text>

It was supposed to be 90 minutes until the driver got there. Nick was there in less than 60 minutes and the car was at the shop 20 minutes later. Great job! Nick is the best!<//Text>

Outrageous fees and insensitive owners.
After returning from Thanksgiving in Texas (95 year old mother-in-law and 98 year old father-in-law), my RV was towed while I was out of town.
Yes, got caught in the 72 hour "move-it" ordinance.
Luckily the Lompoc Police Dept. waived the $175 fine (thanks Sgt. Magana!), but this company is demanding $1200 as of Dec. 2, 2019 and adding $125/day!! No compromise.
Even after the PD waived the fine!!!
I offered to pay $300-$400 this morning, but Kimberly said no, that "We're in the business of towing, and no negotiation". Unbelievable.
They should be ashamed of their unwillingness to work with me on this.
I will not let this go, and will see them in Court.< /text>

Smitty towing is awesome! Super professional and prompt. I got my truck stuck in the sand and they sent someone out in 15 minutes. My truck was well taken care of, and towed out of the sand quickly and efficiently. I 10000% recommend this company! Great job guys!</review>

Smitty's was awesome. I called for help via AAA, and got a call from a tow truck driver almost as soon as I put in my request. My car is nonstandard and the driver was prepared and equipped for it, no problem. Had me on my way in 20 minutes flat.< /text>

<review>You would think people would learn to keep their hands off of people.

Today started out with me attempting to get them to reason with them. At the end of the day, my mother in law, is recording the Manager and the other employees as they release her vehicle from the impound lot. During the time she was recording he hits the camera. You can see it at 00:49.<//review>< pictures>

I dont like them there ways are rude and outrageous they make it impossible to get your vehicle back. when u get towed because u cant afford registration what makes you think paying 98 dollars a day plus the 350 for the tow its impossible and then when they towed my vehicle off of private property after only being there 45 min is Totally rude and wrong of them to do i hope that all tow company's and employees understand that they will rot in hell for what they do to people<//Text>

Love this gym! During the closure they froze all my payments and credited me for any time I missed. They also have really good live classes for free on Instagram. I enjoy the Yoga classes. The facility itself is really clean and staff is super friendly. I have been to multiple in LA county and it’s pretty much the same at all the locations.< /Text>

Fitness 19 is a GREAT place to work out!

Some users release the weights carelessly, and you can hear the steel banging against steel.  Perhaps, the employee trainers can gently remind these people to be more careful, and release the weights gently.  This action will prolong the life of the equipments.< /text>

<Review>Every time I come in the manager always gives me this look when I'm scanning in that doesn't make me feel welcomed. He looks at me like I'm sneaking in when I've been a member for well over a year. The rest of the staff is amazing always welcoming me with a smile and they even remember my name. I've seen Jose the manager talk to his employees with such an attitude and I don't appreciate that because they work hard. He really needs some training on his customer service, when Sabrina was manager I never experienced any bad vibes from her.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><date>1572916919632<//date><UserId.>103754159613991313044< /UserId.>< rating>

<text>Fitness 19 is a great gym with all the necessary weights, equipment and cardio machines you’ll need to stay and get into shape. And they also have showers and massage chairs, which I take advantage of at least 3x a week.
Staff is friendly and the place is clean. I haven’t taken any classes but that’s  next on the list. Check it out 👍🏼👍🏼< /text>< Pics>

<review>I give it 4 stars only because they don't open at 4AM and close later on weekends hence the one in Chatsworth does so it gives me a shirt time frame to get to work so I stopped coming to this one in the morning. And classes I think most people can attend them the later the better or earlier ?<//review>< time>

Previously I visited this gym a couple times & genuinely enjoyed the experience. The thing is, I am a Active & Fit member and I mentioned this to the manager on site that particular Friday, he at once offered only a $17.99 monthly rate. I found this to be peculiar if their were 3 other good monthly rates on that Black Friday. The manager did NOT offer me those Black Friday deals and did not seem bothered that I walked out of his gym. It’s unfortunate considering I live only a block away from this location but I have no problem driving to other gym providers that made me feel like a welcomed guest through their great Customer Service.

Our Black Friday rates were limited and increasing every couple hours throughout the day. Some of the advertised rates may have no longer been available due to time of day or reached its limit that day.

If I could give zero stars I would. The staff are so unprofessional. The manager is very rude, so what do we expect about the rest of the staff. There’s one girl in particular tall with glasses she’s very rude as well. It looks like she’s forced to be there, I asked her a question and answer me with a idk nothing to do with what I asked. Super bad customer service from everyone there literally. I’m pretty sure I’m not the only one that thinks this. They need to be a little more friendly and at least pretend they like what they are doing because let me remind you we are paying for this service it’s not free.<//Review>

<text>This gym is pretty small and at times stuffy.i really do not recommend it.they charged me $14 a month plus $31 a year on nonsense fees FOR 2 YEARS .After terminating my membership they had the nerve to charge me for an extra month.There are other gyms that offer a lot more for $ 9.99 a month.DO NOT ENROLL AT THIS PLACE, YOU'LL REGREAT IT!.i believe the negative review I read about  the manager Adrian.The extra charge on the additional month after terminating my membership was done by Adrian. Should have been prorated.I WILL REPORT THIS TO CORPORATE OFFICES.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1555636934165, 'text': 'Hi Joss, sorry to hear your frustration. All accounts with Fitness 19 when cancelling are part of a 30 day notice which would mean a last billing would occur, the service you pay for however would allow additional 30 day access. I would speak with the Club Manager Jose, he may be able to help with any clarity for you on the membership or cancellation process.

<text>I enjoy working out here it's in my neighborhood it's real close and there's always a lot of people that are good people to talk to the only thing I have a problem with is sometimes they don't clean their equipment or sometimes people will sweat all over the equipment and not use a towel to wipe up their nasty sweat other than that it's a good place to work out at but I bring a towel with me so I can wipe off the machine so people don't mess up the machines with their sweat and nastiness I never understood why people do that I don't think people understand that you can get really back bad bacterial diseases from multiple sweat and other things<//text>< pics>

<text>I love coming to this gym! The staff is super friendly and they make me look forward to working out. I go to the zumba class and the cardio kickboxing class. Both instructors use music that gets us pumped and we all leave those classes dripping with sweat.
I've also been doing personal training sessions with Drew and he is a great trainer. Always pushes me while knowing my limits and being there to help in case it is a little too much for me. I've learned so much about what exercises help what group muscles and when it's best for me to do them.
Overall, I'm so happy I joined this gym in January and not some fancy gym where the people aren't as welcoming as the people in this gym. Thanks Sylmar crew!!!< /text><UserId.>102834043183685419215< /UserId.><username>Maritza Ruiz</username>< Date>

This gym is great, not perfect, but great. Staff is very friendly and willing to help but don’t get impatient if you see that they are busy (just wait your turn people!). Also, there is more than enough gym equipment to go around. If you see dumbbells missing, blame the people who take them and don’t rack them back up, not the staff. Cardio equipment is always clean with almost zero machines ever breaking down. Showers are also very clean, but then again, I get here in the morning. Now sure how they are in the afternoon or in the evening. And that’s pretty much it.

For these “local guides” giving F19 bad ratings, please fix your English and grammar first. And I doubt half of your claims are even true.</text>

< Review>
I really enjoy coming to this gym, but some of the machines have been over used. The stair master, and some other cardio machines don’t function too good. Also, today I came in with my daughter and instead of them having a sign or post on their Instagram that the child care is closed they waited until I asked to apologize that it was closed. Other than that I got it for a good price, but I feel like they are in competition with USA fitness which has similar prices. It says that it has good prices for the community but it’s equal the USA fitness. Maybe that was just the first year promotion. Overall its okay!< /Review>

<review>This gym sucks I'm amazed with so many complains that the headquarters doesn't act.. the manager shows by example and it shows with the rest of the stuff.. with false advertising comes lawsuits you guys really need to be careful with this stuff. Took them 3 months to call me back way after the promotion i emailed them with and seem to be more disrespectful then help.. employees here care about receiving there pay check not customer services maybe they hired the wrong manager cause like i said they lead by example.. negative 5 stars if possible.. all the people giving 5 starts work there or know someone there,i know this cause i know some of them.. what a joke..</review></record></dataset><record>

If there was a negative 5 I would rate that to this place thanks to the manager named Adrian!
This place is full of false advertisement and arrogant staff!! Specially the manager Adrian who has an attitude of owemership and is full of stupid comments when it comes to having someone to get a membership at this location..if you see any advertisement of a cheap rate/fee do not believe it, once you go inside Adrian will tell you fees have changed and that it's more than what they are advertising for!!when you show him the flyer who clearly states it ends on the 30 th of this month!!  He would tell you he doesn't care if you sing up with them because he still gets a paycheck regardless.. he was. Wey rude and disrespectful!! Please don't sign up at This gym if you don't want your membership to go up monthly because he said that can happen and they can't control that..
This is located on Gladstone and Hubbard!</review>

I honestly don't care for the sushi here (it's not the best), but the ambiance is nice.<//review>

I like this place! They serve first-cleass meals, their menu is nice, The chief cook in that spot is an expert, I enjoy very much trying all their food. The food is always good, the service towards the visitors  is friendly. I often eat in this restaurant and I not even once was discontended. I recommend it to all.< /Review>

We called to find out if Le Sushi used msg or pineapple in its recipes because of food allergies of families members. The person who answered the phone rudely refused to answer the question because he didnt want to give a wrong response. Incredible that a restaurant would refuse to tell you if its food had ingredients that might cause an allergy. Obviously we will not try a restaurant that has such a cavalier attitude towards its potential customers< /Review>

It's cozy but you feel like you're welcomed and that you've been there before many times. It's nice that they offer different choices of appetizers, sushi and chinese food with a couple of dessert options. As we were eating different families of all ages came in and who I would assume to be the owner greeted them and talk to them like they visit everyday. The sushi chef is talented and their server is attentive. Only 4 stars due to pricing but that's California for you.</Review>< date>

<Text>Large menu for both Chinese and Japanese food.  We tried only the Japanese part and were very satisfied.  The fish was fresh, the sushi nicely wrapped, sake pleasantly warm, server Dovid very attentive, and the atmosphere just what you might expect in a neighborhood sushi place.  Really enjoyed the jalapeno appetizer.<//Text>< Rate>

Great place for sushi. The atmosphere there is very warm and relaxing, and the thing i noted the most is the freshness of the products. The Salmon was so fresh that i started to think if there are Salmons in California.
Try them. You will not get disappointed.<//text>

Came in and it was a like a morgue. No music, no talking, no acknowledgement from the chef or waitress. Somewhat off-putting.

Ordered the Fried Shrimp (which has imitation shrimp) ... don't order this. Ever. Tastes like fried used gum. Absolutely terrible.

Got the following rolls:

Spicy Tuna - not good, put together terribly, bland taste for a SPICY roll

Ninja - alright taste, yet not something I would order again, put together terribly, has a slightly crunchy texture that gives it a good mouth feel

Golden Dragon - Order this. Now. It is a cooked roll, but this is the only saving grace of the night! Put together nicely, has a nice, non-greasy flavor, and it does not have a weird aftertaste.

Also, no wasabi or ginger served with the sushi ... out of the thirty or so hibachi/sushi spots I have been to in my life, I have never had to ask for wasabi. And it seemed like the chef was slow to give it to us.

The check comes out fast though, so a star for that in case you need to leave fast.

And new update ... my wife also felt queasy after eating here. I have an iron stomach, but that bodes badly about whether we will ever go back.

A lot of things going wrong here, but maybe they will be different if I try them again in a couple of years or so after getting a new chef.<//text>

My family and I were going to a different Sushi Place, but they were closed last night, so my son googled  for close by Sushi restauranr and we went to Le Sushi. Tiny restaurant and I was hesitant, but wow, did we get a surprise. First of all, since I am allergic to Iodine, I told the hostes, that we needed to seperate anything that had shellfish in it. She said not to worry, this is a Kosher restaurant, no shellfish anywhere. I am in heaven without a worry. Then the food arrived and one roll was better than the other, to finish it of, we asked the chef to make us something excellent, since is was my birthday. We were so impressed. The food was 5+ stars. If you want good Sushi, don't bother - if you want excellent Sushi run, it is a tiny place and you might not find a place to sit if you wait too long. I loved this place and it is my favorite from now on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Review>

In addition to kosher sushi, they serve Chinese dishes as well. I always are their 3 roll combination meal and/or the Kung Pao Chicken.< /Review>

<text>WOW! I hadn't seen a dentist in 7 years.. After weeks of suffering prior, I finally caved and decided to see one. Dr. Britton was recommended by a co-worker and I am so so lucky. I had 3 root canals (first time) and Dr. Britton made this process as painless as possible. His bedside manner is stellar, the staff is so nice and helpful too! You can really tell when there is a sense of happiness and care in a work place and this is it. Dr B did everything he possibly could to make sure that I was not in pain during and afterwards. If you're looking for a review to make a decision on a dentist, you've found it. Call them.< /text>< Pics>

<text>Dr. Britton is an excellent dentist.  I have been going to him since he has been at this location in Mira Mesa.  I had a crown replaced on one of my molars which was a difficult location but he was excellent at what he does and rebuilt another molar identical to what was there !perfect fit!
His assistant Christian as an asset to Dr. Britton team and a very good assist to the Dr.
Thank you
Best wishes,

Dr. B and his assistant Julie has been very consistent with their level of care. They do their best to be caring and inform me of the thing I needed to be informed of. They also personalize their care by not forgetting every bit of patients info. From the time I had my first visit in 2020, I have been referring and telling my friends about Dr. B and the team!</Review>

The staff makes you feel right at home and helped make my decisions easier. I appreciate how they work with your finances and insurance. Also how the staff talks you through step by step what they are doing and recommend for your dental plan. I’ve never been so pleased with a dentist and his assistant. I’ve always felt so embarrassed and unknowledgeable when it came to my dental hygiene, this office makes me feel the complete opposite and gives me motivation to work on a better smile. HIGHLY recommend Dr.Britton! You will not regret it!<//review><user_name>Rita Velarde<//user_name><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

My wife and I have been going to Dr.Britton for over 10 years.
I cannot say enough about the phenomenal staff from the front desk to each and every one of the hygienists (we usually see Stacie and Julie) and dental assistants. They are all very personable and knowledgeable in their field and Dr. Britton is second to none. He has an incredible attention to detail. He always thoroughly explains things in an articulate fashion, but simple enough so that you can understand it. I tell everyone about him, because I have no doubts that their experience will be as good as mine.< /Text>

<date>1600108071029< /date><text>This dentist is terrible. He doesn’t do what you him to. He personally bullies you into procedures that you don’t want, and doesn’t do what you made the appointment for. He lies and say he will do things when he knows he isn’t going to. The office doesn’t  tell you the charge up front and then try to bill you for exorbitant costs afterwards.

They also aren’t good with appointments and won’t allocate proper people, length of time, or time of day. Like if you make an appointment for a procedure; the only person who does that procedure won’t be available at the time of your appointment. And it won’t be because it’s an abnormal situation, it’s their normal schedule. So you end up going there for nothing.

If you make a simple appointment for a cleaning, they will refuse to do it and do all this other stuff that you don’t want them to  then try to charge you like $500, or they will make some other appointments and make you come back another time to get the cleaning you  wanted.

Terrible customer service!!< /text>< Name>

He  pushes you to do unnecessary procedures: X-rays, cancer check, replacing perfectly fine fillings, doing caps, night guards, anything that he can bill insurance for more money or charge you direct where insurance won’t cover it.

He is not honest. He will tell you he will do things to pacify you, but then not do them.

Meanwhile he will send you unexpected and high bills for services you didn’t ask for, and not perform what you were there to do.

He talks you into things you don’t want.

Afterwards when you leave, you feel very pushed around and mad at yourself for consenting to his desires.

The office staff do what he says, so they participate in this pushy behavior indirectly< /text></record></dataset><record>

Been with Dr Britton for about an year now, so this overview is long overdue... My excuse is that I wanted to take the time and find the words to tell about my experience with him. Been myself an interesting (read complex) case since I was 9 when I got my first cavity, with frequent visits to the dentist despite mostly aligned teeth and good oral hygiene. Following my previous dentist retirement, ended up dentist "homeless" for about an year before I ended up consulting Dr Britton who took on my case: regular cleanings, night guards, fillings, crowns and even teeth whitening... Very happy and relieved to have found him - he is knowledgeable, attentive and has all the modern dental technology (digital X-rays and 3D printing dental crowns in particular) which I truly appreciate. Hey, did I mention he is also fun, plus likes music and French food? And, yes, brought the family with me, my husband and 3 children. So... very much looking with confidence to the future of our smiles!</Review>

I went today for cleaning and evaluation and enjoy interacting with staff  at  Dr. Britton's office. They are friendly and kind and exercise a great deal of care in  Covid safety protocols. Kim, my  hygienist, did a thorough job cleaning and always provides helpful hints with my daily hygiene.  I briefly saw Dr. Britton who confirmed things are on track.   I enjoy my visits and am  thankful for the quality care I receive from Dr. Britton and his staff.</review>

<userid>101310694191939513271< /userid><response>None< /response><Review>Never used Dr William Britton .
I tried getting in for an appointment , but the office cancelled it an hour prior to meeting for the time this Dentist
I do understand Emergency's come up unfortunately it happens..
HOWEVER this office WAS NOT anxious  to reschedule this appointment
with trying to make it work for another convenient day , since they cancelled. THEY DO NOT CARE PERIOD..

I do feel very sorry for the person who own this business..
It is SAD. it's also a good sign on how bad they run this office
I had to find another Dentist that meets my needs .

This same Person named "Cori "  that called me and cancelled that day my appointment  did lie to me  in previous conversation on the phone
And i reported her to her Co-worker
I am sure this Dentist  knows nothing about it or how the Staff is running his business..sad, It might also be a Good dentist..
I guess i will never know !!<//Review>< name>

From the first phone call to my last visit, my experience was great. Dr. Britton is a dentist who not only does excellent dental work but is able to put you at ease. He has surrounded himself with a wonderful, caring & helpful staff. The best!< /Text>

I just had to leave a review because they deserve 5 stars.  The staff and Dr. Britton are amazing.   It is very hard to find someone you can trust/rely on to give you sound advise about your teeth.  He is always very nice and tells it like it is.  My whole family uses him and not one of them has anything bad to say which includes my little ones.
I had to go twice, back to back to take care of some issues that came up and Dr. Britton made time for me which I was grateful for during these covid virus times.  His office is very clean and goes over and beyond to make certain that his office and staff take precautions.
For example, he has hepa filters all around his office on top of the handwashing and rinsing your mouth with hydrogen peroxide.

I could go on but hands down he is the best out of all I have experienced.   To top it off after your vist he gives you a hot facetowel that is awesome.  👍🏋️‍♂️

Keep up the good work......<//Text>

<Review>Dr. Britton is like no other dentist I have ever had and I have had many throughout my life. He is completely concerned with what is best for the patient. He is very gentle while he is working on your teeth, even when giving you a shot to numb the area he is working on. He is a perfectionist and has done such a beautiful job on my teeth. He is friendly and makes you feel comfortable throughout your visit. When you are done you can be assured you have been treated by the best.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1523894776667, 'text': 'We appreciate the wonderful review, thank you.

I've had a fear of the dentist since I was a kid.  Dr. Britton was recommended to me by a colleague over 7 years ago and I've been going to him ever since.  So good that I followed him to Mira Mesa to his new office.  His team is amazing, incredibly gentle, patience and respectful of my uneasiness with the dentist in general.  He makes you feel welcomed every time and has a killer memory with things I've shared with him!  His work is outstanding as well.  He's worked with me and my schedule to get stuff done in a timely manner but without pressuring me.  He also has helped work with all things insurance related and he always makes sure to check to see what insurance would cover before just doing the work. I would highly recommend him and his office!<//Review>

I had a cleaning appointment today.  Kim, the new hygienist, was friendly and thorough. I felt she did a good job cleaning my teeth and offering feedback on how I can improve my oral hygiene.  Dr. Britton stopped in to say "hello".  I like the fact Dr. Britton takes the time to greet me.  I have a great deal of confidence entrusting my dental care to Dr. Britton and his staff.<//text>

<Text>Dr. Britton and his staffs are the best. I have been coming here for 5 years now for all sorts of dental work. I've had dental cleanings,  wisdom tooth crown placement, and a month ago also had the crowns for the upper front two teeth replaced here. I am getting lots of compliments from friends and family who know I had front crowns replaced. Unless I tell you, you won't know it's a crown. It's that good. I get nervous about any dental procedure as I had a bad experience 10 years ago at a previous dental place during my wisdom tooth extraction. But, after meeting  Dr. Britton for the first time and telling him about my dental history, hearing his response, suggestions, treatment plan, courteous staff, I felt I would like this clinic. They are so great with scheduling, follow up, reminders.
I loved the dental brush for back tooth and the rubber cleaning tool they included in the dental goodies. Certainly, has helped me in my dental regime. I am very happy to have found them.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Bill is a great dentist and a great friend. I get much more than just dentistry at his office... it's free talk therapy! JK He is a great friend and it's a great, fun experience. He is a kind hearted, warm, hilarious guy. He has a great staff and team working with him. He has always met me at the level of my needs and done the best work possible. He is dedicated to helping others and has admirable principles. It's worth the drive from Carlsbad!<//text>

Dr. Britton is seriously the best dentist I've ever had. He has top notch bedside manner and he is an approachable, trust worthy person. When he's recommended work, it's always been in my best interest. He's worked on my cavity prone teeth with gentle caring hands. The work is always impeccable. My four year old has been coming to see him since he was 1 and actually loves going to see Dr. B.
We don't live close to his office but we make the long drive for the peace of mind that we have the best in the business taking care of our teeth. I recommend him to all of my friends.< /text>

Dr. Britton is my dentist-dream-come-true if there is such a thing! I have been going to him for over a decade;following him from his previous office. He sincerely cares about his patients and the outcome of every procedure. He is smart and offers advice when there are options for treatment. He is a perfectionist and shows such patience in "getting it right". On top of it all, he is such a fine, good person and so likeable. His staff is a reflection of him-- all very professional and friendly with a can-do approach. Thank you!<//Text>

I've been coming to Dr. Britton for almost two years, now, and the difference is astounding! Not only are my teeth in significantly better shape, but I went from having anxiety attacks walking in the door, to wearing a smile every time I'm greeted by the amazing staff! Dr. Britton worked with me to ease my fears, going so far as to set up aromatherapy, music and even movies to help make things easier for me, and I couldn't be more grateful for it. Every experience in the chair is a good one and I can't recommend him and his staff enough!< /Review>

I have been afraid of dentists for decades, but Dr. Britton is a whole different experience. I won't say I "love" going to see him, but the fear is gone. He is kind, gentle, and a great dentist.  No shakes.  I had to have a bridge replaced yesterday, and he and Jessica (if I got your name wrong, sorry, I'm old) were wonderful. It's a long way for me to go (I followed him from his previous office (I may be his oldest old patient) but worth every mile. His office is the absolute best. Need a dentist?  Try Dr. Britton, you won't be disappointed. Thank you all.

As I have said before, Dr. Britton is the only Dentist I do not fear. The entire office is pleasant, and professional. My last two visits were for cleaning and Julie and Kim were terrific,  It is never "fun" to visit any Doctor, but Dr. Britton's office as as close as you can get.</Text>

Willam is a fraudster, will charge you, take insurance payment, then attempt to charge you more claiming the insurance did not pay enough. Stay away, also did not do a good job, lacks expertise but good at sales.<//Text>

Dr. Britton is simply the best, I’ve had horrible experiences with other dentistry in the past due to having Medi-Cal. Now I know what it’s like to have top notch dentistry.
Dr. Britton explains thoroughly what he is doing to my teeth to ease my nerve. His place is always clean and his staff are beautiful and polite. Couldn’t recommend this place enough!<//Text>

<review>In the past 2 years i've been here i had a not so awesome experience a few times. This was when i was a new patient and had different hygienists that were pretty rough. I'd walk out pretty unhappy each time.  One of the secretaries was a little too pushy and called often to reschedule my appointments, trying to get me in sooner, or more often. Even though my insurance only covered a certain time frame.

However, that has all changed. From Annie being brought in to replace the previous receptionist, to my new dental hygienist Kim, i have actually been looking forward to going to my cleanings now. The staff is super friendly, polite, and very sweet. Especially Annie, she's so happy and smiling all the time, and she has a very fun personality. I love interacting with her and appreciate that she's so nice.

Kim is awesome, funny, and sweet. Not to mention that she's really gentle and does a wonderful and thorough job on my gums. Everyone else that works there as well, even the new receptionist are all very nice.

Now as for Dr. Britton, he's crazy....Haha jk! He's not only a very talented dentist, but he is very good at what he does and he always goes above and beyond to make sure his patients are comfortable and happy. He's quite hilarious and i always look forward to his jokes when i see him. One of the best dentists in SD if not THE best, and my husband and i couldn't ask for a better one.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>Dr. Britton is an exceptionally competent, kind, funny, gentle and HONEST dentist. I always feel listened to about any concerns I may have as he does not have an agenda other than providing the best dental care available. He is conservative in his approach, providing options on varying levels of treatment.

While most people don't look forward to going to the dentist, I can say that it is always a positive experience in Dr. Britton's office. The ladies who support him are prompt, courteous, efficient and personable.

I've been seeing Dr. Britton for years - have followed him from office to office. His work ethic and personal charm are second to none.  I recommend him to all family and friends!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<Review>It has been a while since I visited a dentist - five years actually. Between moving across the country and frankly, not being happy with the work of a previous dentist, I avoided setting an appointment. Dr. Britton is by far the best dentist I have received care for in my 38 years of life.

He translated all of what needed to be done into terms I could understand and he made the plan of action with my input and needs in mind. Then the actual work on my teeth has been superior. I still have more to do but the couple of fillings went in with precision and patience. Dr. Britton will make you comfortable and do amazing work.

The staff at his office also deserves credit. The hygienists and assistants are kind and seemed like they enjoyed their jobs - which in dentistry seems hard to find! Need a dentist? Check out Dr. Britton.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Dr. Britton is indescribably amazing. The least painful Dentist experience i have had in 30 years. He bent over backwords to make every accommodation for our family. Scheduled us in and worked on his day off. I can not recommend him strongly enough. Trust me if you have a choice, see Dr Britton.</Review>

Had Dr Britton at his dentist when he was at via La Jolla Dentistry.  Maybe things have charged but, At his former practice he had a few complaints of recommending unnecessary procedures.  My personal experience was him telling me I had progressively more cavities.  To the point where I became suspicious and questioned him on it and told him I would get a second opinion.  Dr Britton offered to give me $25 tooth paste which would fix the cavity in a vain attempt to cover up why after getting two second opinions I was told I had no cavity. 2 years later and still no cavity.  Be wary of unnecessary procedures you might want to get a second opinion.<//text>

Dr. Britton's office, in additional to providing me with exceptional ongoing dental care, has been trying to encourage me to have my teeth straightened, which I had been rejecting because I've been uninterested in a purely cosmetic procedure.  However they have become increasingly concerned because my crowded teeth are getting to the point of impacting my health.  With that incentive, I began to look into the Invisalign treatment that they recommended.  During my decision process and after I decided that it was the right and healthy solution, Dr. Britton's office has bent over backwards to answer my questions, make sure that I'm comfortable during the procedures, and treat my concerns and requirements with respect, transparency, and flexibility.  I'm looking forward to a healthier mouth through the Invisalign procedure.   I've been very impressed with Dr. Britton and his staff for their friendliness as well as their knowledge.  I highly recommend this dentist office to anyone.  A+++<//Review>

I needed a small piece of jewelry engraved.  I arrived without an appointment.  I met the owner, "Al." He was very patient, professional, and service oriented.  Al engraved it on the spot while I waited.   It took some time to set up his precision engraving equipment.  He let me observe his engraving process and use of his engraving technology/machines.  Al,  is a really interesting man once you get to chat with him.  He has lived a lot of life and has that true entrepreneurial spirit and small town attention to service which is lost in today's modern society.   He knows, enjoy, and lives his trade.  He gave me exactly what I came in for, and with no wait. There was no, "come back in three days."  I got quality service, professional work, friendly treatment, from a great man.   "Work where you must, but live, and shop [at 1st Choice Watch & Clock Repair] in Tustin."< /Text>

AL is an absolute professional!

Wouldn't trust anyone else with my watches.  He fixed my Rolex is 25 minutes when Tournau & Traditional Jewelers both had no idea what to do.  Thanks again!<//review>

Al is the best!!!  He is so kind, professional and caring. You can tell he loves his profession.  I called him to see if I could stop by to replace a watch battery on a MIchele watch, he told me it would be quick and quick it was.  His prices are reasonable and he is so customer service oriented, not to mention knowledgeable.  I have used him in the past as well and was still satisfied.  Please do yourself a favor, ask Al and let Al take care of your watch needs.<//Text>

<text>I needed a vintage folded-link bracelet resized and originally tried taking it to Fast Fix Jewelry & Watch Repairs in Irvine. They wouldn’t help me because the bracelet was “breakable” in their opinion.

Al, on the other hand, understood immediately how to remove a damaged link and how to quickly size the bracelet to my liking. He helped me in minutes while I waited. I’m glad I found him, as he was very knowledgeable and professional. I’ll be bringing my business his way in the future.</text>< pics>

I went in to get a watch bracelet fitted, and was helped immediately. The owner was very polite and adjusted the bracelet quickly and professionally. He's knowledgeable about watches (including obscure brands) and can probably help you with any problems you might have. I'd definitely recommend  this place.<//review>

I took my Rolex watch to Mr. Al for over haul it was the best decision ever, Mr. Al is the best (hands down) watch repair, I would 100% recommend to all of the Rolex owners and other expensive watch owner to go see Mr. Al for your watch services. One year ago I took my Rolex watch to Clock Master in Orange, it was the biggest mistake ever. 100% recommend to go see Mr. Al for your next Rolex watch service. He's the Best in OC.< /text>

< Review>
I usually don’t post about my experience unless it was something special. I was on my third attempt to get my brothers glasses fixed when I came upon Tustin Watch Repair. My experience there was so awesome I just had to post something. As I said this was the third place I went to and found success! My brother has dementia and is unable to see without his glasses which were broken. When I took them here the gentleman was so sweet and was able to fix the glasses for me. The store itself was just stunning and I would live to go back again to see all the beautiful clocks he has on display. He quoted me a price before working on the glasses and when he was done gave me a discount. During this time dealing with the virus epidemic it’s hard to find anyone to help. Ok I’m rambling here sorry, but I have all intention on returning and having him fix my watch which I haven’t been able to wear for a long time. I promise you won’t regret going to this store! Thank you again for such great service! You made my brother very happy!</Review>

always take the time to satisfy the customer. Doesn't matter how many watchbands I looked at! I came back for the 4th time and have bought 3 times before. hes ridiculous!

Great experience with Al, the owner. He told me they are third generation watch experts and gave me exceptional service. They even answered their phones before doors opened. The battery replacement required a little more labor than a standard watch, but Al got it done quickly and professionally. This will be the only place I come for watch repair from now on.</review>

Al is incredibly skilled and knowledgeable at his craft. He takes the time to explain the problem/solution clearly to the customer. You will not find a better price anywhere else. If you do, they will not be as skilled as he is. So, if you have a family heirloom and you want to make sure that it is taken care of properly, I suggest that you take it to him.
Also, while I was there, I noticed that other jewelers bring their watches to him for repair. I found out that they take the watch from customers and bring it to Al because they don't have the knowledge or skills to repair it them self. Al fixes it for them and then they take that watch back and charge the customer double or triple the price. So, if you don't want to get ripped off, I suggest going to him in the first place.</Review>

<Review>I came here to have two wedding gifts engraved and I received amazing service. The gentleman was very patient and helpful with all of my requests, and the end result was beautiful! Both recipients loved their gifts, especially the engravings. Plus the price was very fair. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who needs engraving and I will be coming back for all my engraving and watch needs.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<text>I was on my lunch hour and Al (owner) was so accommodating to fix my watch while I waited.  My watch was a dual read (analog/digital) and Al pointed out that two batteries were required.  Experience, a Timely repair, Professionalism and Reasonable prices make 1st Choice my go to for all future repairs.</text>< username>

<review>I have been here twice to get three of my watches repaired. He is a very nice person and the service was very quick. He always offered us with more than what was needed for the repair with the additional service being free of cost. I highly recommend this place.</review>< time>

When do you ever see five stars with 290 reviews on Yelp.... I've never seen that!

Well after doing business with them I know why. I took 3 watches to him. In just a little over 10 minutes he had replaced the batterys in all three of them. But he took the little extra steps like cleaning the inside of the glass before he put it back together. Didn't realize it but my watches look sharper, after having the glass cleaned. I also found out he uses Swiss batteries. $15 for Batteries is a reasonable price anywhere you go. But it's cool that he uses the best batteries available. And he does the little extra things like cleaning, without charging more.

Now if we can just get this level of customer service at car washes locally here in town...< /Text>

Dear Kevork, I just wanted to send you a note to tell you how happy I am with the work on the vintage Omega. The dial refinishing in particular turned out very well, much better than I had imagined. The watch is beautiful, as if I had walked into a jewelry store in the late 1950's and purchased it new. Thank you very much, it's now a timepiece that I can enjoy for many years to come. I can't wait to see the Bucherer. Thanks again. Sincerely<//Review>

<text>This store and Al were nothing short of PHENOMENAL. I was in a pinch and needed my boyfriend's watch repaired in a short amount of time, so I google searched places around my work and stumbled across this store (conveniently located with great parking availability). He had me in the store, watch repaired, paid and leaving within 7 minutes tops. Very professional, very friendly and conversational while doing the repair as well. If I ever need help with a watch or clock again, I will DEFINITELY be back! Thanks, Al!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80dcdbdb8d5f8be9:0x61f63f5e2ead8a0a<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Great guy, great service! I came in the store for a minor fix, but the owner was very polite and the repair took less than 5 mins to do. When I asked him for the pricing for the service, he stated it was 5$ I only had debit card on me, obviously for something so cheap he didn't want me to swipe the card, so instead he said, "the next time your in the area drop by and give me the 5 dollars then." Regardless of the amount of the money it took to fix the watch, in my opinion that speaks volume. His character is what was most impressive, as well as the timeliness and dedication to the task at hand, and if you ask me that's someone I'd always bring my business to, and recommend to anybody if your ever in the area. 👍🏾👍🏾< /Review>

I found this place with a Google search to repair my watch in my area and I am glad I read all the previous review. usually the reviews are written by people who are less than satisfied in these forums but all these positive reviews should have meant something and they did!
Fast service, nice and good mannered owner, I feel like I know the gentleman for years now :)
Definitely will tell my friends about him.< /review>

<review>My husband found this place on google search under Rolex watch repair. We then drove 1 1/2 hrs to go see Al and we are glad we did. This man is very  knowledgeable when it comes to watches and clocks. My husband and I  where amazed at how fast he took the watch apart, found the problem and fixed it in a matter of 2 hrs. He also did an overhaul and cleaned my husband watch. I was amazed because his watch has not looked that good in years. I want to thank you for your knowledge and for taking care of us on a timely manner due to the fact that we live so far. We will definitely be recommending him to friends and family. Next month we will be returning to him for an overhaul on our Omegas.
Thanks Al</review>< pictures>

On my first visit there was a customer in front of me that had a problem with his watch. Al helped him out, explained everything to him and the customer left happy. It gave me a really good feeling as I handed him my Omega Seamaster that I had tried to swap the bezel on myself. Since I have no idea what I was doing I nearly destroyed the watch and left some pretty decent gouges in the case. I left the watch with Al and got a call about 2 hours later that everything was done. I picked up the watch and it was perfect. Based on what I did to the poor thing I was not expecting much. Al really exceeded my expectations and the price was very honest and beyond fair. I could not be happier! Al is as good as they come. I will be taking any watch related issues to him without hesitation in the future.</Text>

I think all these positive reviews on here are fabricated or friends of his. I went off by reviews and my experience was terrible. I took in my watch to have the battery replaced, and he charged me $15 and on top of that he installed the battery cover plate upside down..found out when I got home...didn't wanna drive all the way back. Also he was not very friendly at all. The local swap meet said they would have done the job for $5 i made a big mistake coming here

My head of charging cable was broken and portion of the head was left in my iPad. I tried computer shops and even an Apple Store, none of them can't do anything.  But this watch repairman only took 5 min to fix it and the service charge  only $5. Highly recommend to anyperson to come here if you have the same kind of problems.< /text>

Came here to get my finger prints done for a state certification. Thought I had come to the wrong place because his main business is clock and watch repair. He charges for paying with visa or MasterCard, so plan accordingly< /review>

<Text>I sent my watch to have a small thing fixed and then I get my watch broken and totally not working and the owner with total disrespect doesn't refund the money and doesn't take responsibility.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>
{'time': 1450651116332, 'text': 'You brought me a fake Chinese Rolex last week that has damage dial and one of the hand of watch was loose inside the watch. You requested me to put the hand back on the watch. I said “this is a fake Chinese watch that is made very cheaply and it is already broken and hands are coming off. However, I can only put the hand back on but it may not stay on due to pour design and material of the watch”. You still asked me to work on it.  So I did put the lose hand back. After one-week, yesterday you called and said hand is off again and ask if I can put that back on again, I said okay, when you came to my shop I was working on another watch. I said let me finish this one and then I will try one more time to put yours loose hand back on. It will take about 30 minutes. You left saying you will be back in 20 minutes. Before I could open the back of the watch, I noticed the watch is not working and the crown is locked in setting time position and is not going to normal winding position, this is due to some metallic particles lose inside and jamming the watch setting system.So I did not start any work  on your watch until you come back in 20 minutes, I said this watch has additional problems and loose hand is not the only problem, it need more work. You said okay never-mind and took the watch back without any repair done on it! Now you blaming it on me!  I could fix the watch if you wanted to. But as I said before, this watch can fell working again due to cheap design and material. I hope I clear the miss understanding. (By the way last weak you said you are working for Tustin jewelry Exchange and the watch repair at that place did not want to work on you watch!!!I wonder why you came to my shop instead of having it repaired there?)

This was an amazing place! They were playing music from the early 2000s and every song was like a blast to the past! Best DJ's and awesome staff! I didn't have to wait too long to get served and the crowd life was awesome. Everyone was dancing there weren't really wall flowers or any awkwardness. It was just a really fun vibe and I made lots of friends. 10/10 would visit again. I'm excited to see what other themed nights they have< /text>

We have had 3 birthday parties here and always during the night with the flamenco dance performance.  THe food is awesome, the performance is wonderful and the after party/dancing is so much fun with wonderful African music.  One year it was my birthday and there was a guest DJ and we had a blast!<//text>

<Date>1579460683651< /Date><review>Fun random find for me! Amazing all around. The drinks were shockingly good for being draft. I wad in a smokey mood so I tried the Flannel Jacket and Down in Mexico (both highly recommended).

Food is on point. I had the Mediterranean Potatos and it was a meal in itself.

Chilly night as well, but they had two fires going so it was perfect outside.

Will be back next time I'm in LA!< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Beautiful and modern interior. The menu isn't extensive (except for the cocktail list which was amazing!) but each dish we tried was great. The only exception was the ahi tuna tartare which was a bit oily, but otherwise everything was excellent. Can particularly recommend the Pork Chop as an entree, which was fabulous. Atmosphere was mixed - we were seated next to a slightly noisy family - but the interior design was dark, moody and perfect for a dinner for two.</Review>< Gmap_id>

Cool lounge area, food is mediocre and the happy hour offerings are kind of lame.  That said, it's a good place to meet if you have a large group.  It wouldn't be my first choice if I was planning to go out in Soma.<//text>

Came in during happy hour... $5 local craft beers on tap! I got the fried pickles and fish and chips - delicious! My server was an absolute delight.</Review>

<text>"Piñata stores, empty warehouses and streets-less-roamed pass by as you make your way to Resident LA. Step out to a beautifully vine covered building with flowers exploding out of its front gate. As you pass through two converted trailers, a scene reminiscent of Austin, Texas, you’ll notice the décor is a mixture of throwback outdoor movie theater, a roadside motel in Arizona and your friend’s backyard with the cool parents. It’s like a minute vacation in the middle of downtown LA. Comfortably relax on the patio with beer and sandwich in hand. Once the crowds pour in relinquish that perfect spot next to the fire pit because you’ve got a 60,000 sq/ft warehouse full of art waiting for you."

We were looking for a fun place to go Sunday night Presidents Day weekend, and this place hit the spot. Live salsa music, which turned into house around midnight. The staff is very friendly, the drinks were fairly priced, and the mood was great the whole time. We're definitely coming here again.< /Text>

Resident is a leftover star from the dot-com boom-bust days - all these years and still going strong.  The place is nice enough and gets pretty packed during weekday nights, composed of business casuals, hipsters, and the occasional influx of nametag-wearing convention goers.  The music can be quite good but the sound system and acoustics of the place could use some work.  A great place for people watching and/or to hang out if you don't mind having to talk much louder than usual.</review>

People come to the Arts District looking for an authentic "Arts District Vibe". As someone who has lived in this part of downtown for almost 20 years, I can tell you that The Resident totally captures the feel of the old arts district before it became an over priced millennial nightmare. Tim and Bridget are the real deal and you can feel the care they put into the place from the overall layout of the place, to the wonderful details of the decor. The Resident was designed by artists, for artists but everyone is welcome.<//review>

My first time here and absolutely loved it. Haven't danced so much in ages! Staff were always pleasant. Door woman so lovely and patient. The jazz band and DJ we saw on Friday night gone were super and got the place moving. Look forward to returning with more friends soon. Cover charge was $10 and drinks $7/8 to $14< /text>

Be sure to bring your clip on mustache and giant glasses. You'll have a good time.<//text></record>

Didn't go inside because I wasn't going to pay $10 for a show when I was only stopping in for an hour to try their Naked and Famous drink. Speaking of which for a mezcal drink it was actually quite sweet but not in a bad way. I was surprised how well all the flavors complimented each other. The outside area was really nice. I was able to get a spot on a bench in the corner and I just drank and people watched. Will definitely be going back with friends.</Text><rating>5<//rating>< user_name>

I was invited to see a friend perform at the Resident, and was nervous that I wouldn’t make it in time because typically parking downtown is crazy. Parking was a breeze with a couple lots on the same street and also even street parking. The bouncer was super cool and inviting and the overall decor and ambiance of the venue was super cool. The outside patio had an intimate yet lively vibe (yes both) and the inside area was perfect for a live performance. The bar mixed up some good drinks and I look forward to coming back on just a regular night.<//Text>< Pictures>

Reminded me of the Lab in Costa Mesa without the shopping. It's mostly outdoors but there is an inside bar area with a dance floor area and indoor restrooms. The whole space is 21+ which i appreciated because the main outdoor areas are free of kids and you can walk freely with your drinks.

I'll definitely go back<//text>

Fair price for the show and drinks. There's an upstairs but not sure if public can go up. It can get pretty hot in this place when people are packed for a show. The outside is great. There's gas fire pits and tables to hangout at. Would recommend going to see a band here< /review>

A nice quaint Oasis in DTLA. I prefer seeing music acts here rather than just hanging out. However by today's trends, experiences and unique pop-ups this place will be perfect if that's your liking. So all in and all I'll be back I'm sure depending who ends up playing.</review>

Really liked this place. Has a nice indoor outdoor vibe and the food trucks are the bomb.</review>

< review>
PRO: Great food truck, neat hipster & industrial looking outdoor large private patio. BBQ pulled pork & chicken wrap we're very tasty! Feels you're in someone's large back yard in Venice Beach. Inside, good size stage. Smoking allowed & an entire table was openly smoking joints when we went for drinks/dinner. Nice website for photos and info.

CON: Overpriced on everything, poorly maintained (for a new gentrified venue), limited parking, & short staffed. You'll drop $120 easy (2 people) at a very casual place. Many "atmosphere" items not working or set up at night, like broken patio lights, bathroom sign half broken, fire pits off on a cold night; it took several requests and +20mis for staff to find the right person to turn them on & cover other positions (bartender had to work door & delay drinks so security could start the pits). Tasty cocktails on tap, but mostly ice & overpriced by almost double for this part of town and simple refurbished venue.

We'd go again to see music, but I'd save my $$ and eat/drink elsewhere after trying it once for the full experience.</review>

This place is cool! The little cocktail and food truck are both stocked with great food and drinks, and there's seating, shade, misters + fans on the patio, and picnic tables to eat and chat. The Kitchen DTLA is excellent. My husband got a falafel and I got a tomato sandwich, and both were delicious. We got a painkiller drink + a gin drink called Lime and the Coconut at the drinks truck and had a wonderful lunch. Fun place! The music was great too.<//review>

I went to the tribute at Michael Jackson and Prince, it was very good.  Pleasant atmosphere, the drinks have a reasonably fair price, the people who attended that day, apparently over 30 years old, I liked it.</Review>

Thus was born the Star Wars Tiki event, where the music was set on Spotify's "popular" section, forgetting the existence of the star wars OST and some guy named Israel Kamakawiwo'ole.

"Brunch" is written on a board for some reason. We probably don't have the same dictionary because in mine, "Brunch" and "Lunch" are two different things.

Oh and don't be on a hurry, apparently it takes 20 minutes to cook two wraps.< /Text><Rate>1</Rate>< UserId.>

This was honestly a great venue :) Very small and intimate, there are food trucks on the patio, as well as fire pits. The inside, where the bar and dance floor are, is very low key, and small. The stage is super close, which just makes this a great, intimate venue to see a favorite artist. The lighting is low, with red lamps, and it's just a nice ambiance. Water is only $1 per bottle, super cheap, and the employees are really nice. I would definitely like to come here again :)< /Text>

This place was so great and welcoming! The atmosphere is nice and is shaded with trees. The first place you enter is technically the Patio/lounging area but inside is where it's at. You're presented by the DJ on the right and the bar to your left and the dance floor further down in yh4 center when you enter. I had an overall great experience with fairly priced drink and food. P.S I bought water for just $1! That's never the case at a club. They also provide free water as well. I'll be visiting again soon.<//Text>

I don't drink so they were happy to make mocktails and didn't charge regular price. The place was a bit empty and even though it was a little rainy they closed the indoor section by 8pm, wth? It was a slow night, I didnt try the food truck they have there but I am sure any other night this place would be great and have great music.

Great atmosphere and perfect weather. What more could you ask for? Great walk from all the places nearby. Heard about the area from the Facebook group "Things to do in LA" and it was definitely worth the drive. The fire pits are a great touch especially because we went on a chilly night.< /review>

Very unique space. The beer garden has delicious food and drinks. Also there is a good amount of seating and it's easy to talk in large groups. Inside offers live music or a DJ depending on the night with some amazingly cool acts.< /review>

<text>What a great space! The patio is friendly and welcoming, with a food truck on one side and the bar on the other, offering good seating options conducive to good chats among friends as well as mingling with others. Gin & Tonics are also quite generous :-)< /text><Date>1528666519549<//Date></record>

The outdoor courtyard at the Resident rivals any other in LA for beauty, a sense of peace and place (feeling like you really are in the middle of the metropolis), and the casual feel of a beer garden. Given it's proximity to the arts district and Little Tokyo, this bar/eatery/venue is probably one of the best situated in all of LA. Reasonably priced cocktails (try the London Calling!) for LA standards at a hipster joint (~$12 at this posting), and a great small floor space and stage for live music. The on-site food truck makes tasty (if a bit salty) food - some nice options (I think a lot are potato focused) and I remember a really great grilled cheese sandwich. Friendly and chill staff/bartenders. I've never been on the weekend, but during the week, this spot is pretty much the perfect place to spend some time with friends!<//Text>

Came here on a Saturday night at about 10:00 pm and stayed the rest of the night. The vibe at the Resident is very relaxed but fun. The music is great and definitely adds to the ambiance. There are two parts to the Resident. One section is the outdoor seated section, and they have plenty of seating to relax and enjoy a cocktail or some food from the food truck. The second section, I have not been into, but learned from an employee, that weather there is a cover charge varies from night to night depending on the event or Band that is playing that night. Overall if you are looking for a relaxed place to enjoy a drink, catch up in the evening while still being out and about, this is definitely the place.<//Text>

<rating>4<//rating><review>Arrived at about 4 pm on a Saturday and we got a nice big corner table. It was pretty got outside but they had some misters going so it was very pleasant! From the drink truck I got a New Fashioned which was delicious: the orange flavor was perfect and the bourbon was nice and strong. From the food truck I got the chicken salad onto which I put some habanero sauce. A woman behind new in line even said: "That looks so good!" And it was! Crunchy onions, goat cheese, and fried chicken.</review>< Pictures>

I love this place.  I have been just a few times, but they offer a variety of live music, food trucks, cheap drinks and drink specials.  And it is in some hidden oasis of available parking in the arts district.  I aways see parking spots just within a block, not sure how though. It also has nice outside area near the food trucks for chilling, eating, smoking, an they also have a fire pit.<//Text>

This place is so cool! Food is awesome and reaonsably priced. There's a lot of free street parking too. Just have to get there early enough to get a spot. Super cozy place. Fires are set up in different spots. You can sit outside or inside where the stage is. Just very cool and a great place to meet friends. Definitely will be going back.< /Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>The RESIDENT is a pleasant surprise in the #DTLA community. The live DJs   Ty Cannon and QWest  Coast held a old fashioned dance party that was indeed a party. The RESIDENT offers an indoor club experience and an outdoor patio like experience for conversion and eating. The food truck experience was excellent. I ordered the breakfast wrap it was delicious it came with the unique fries too $12. The parking was close $10 flat rate. The neighborhood safe. I highly recommend the RESIDENT for all especially the culturally diverse. OAM</review>< Pictures>

Great place with awesome ambiance in downtown L.A. Small, but a lot of fun and there are gourmet roach coach type eating places on the grounds. Lots of special venue nights.</Review>

The RESIDENT is a pleasant surprise in the #DTLA community. The live DJs   Ty Cannon and QWest  Coast held a old fashioned dance party that was indeed a party. The RESIDENT offers an indoor club experience and an outdoor patio like experience for conversion and eating. The food truck experience was excellent. I ordered the breakfast wrap it was delicious it came with the unique fries too $12. The parking was close $10 flat rate. The neighborhood safe. I highly recommend the RESIDENT for all especially the culturally diverse. OAM<//text>

Awesome patio with food trucks. Seen 1000mods and telekinetic yeti here. Love shows at smaller venues like this. My friends and I drove from Santa Barbara. We drove right into skid row and wondered if this was where the show was going to be. Seemed like we went through a stop light and the scenery changed dramatically. Very good experience all together.</Review>

Very small club with a great vibe and a fun outdoor area to eat from food trucks and hang out. If you're going to a big event here and you hate crowds, don't expect to have much room.<//review>

<text>Great venue. Decor was nice in and out. Parking is rough but that's downtown for you. The exit inside is by the stage so it makes it weird if you're leaving when there's a performance. Accessibility wise, wheelchair can maneuver around easily, the bathroom downstairs will not work but they have one on the outside. The same issue with exiting from the inside, one would have to get through the crowd for the door or go around the other way. Keeping communication with staff will be your best bet.</text>< Pictures>

<text>Took some time on my spring break to get out of Burbank and enjoy some of the downtown Los Angeles area.  A friend and I decided to check out the Samskara 360 immersive art experience so why not stop here for a drink.  We were saving our appetites for after the art exhibit so we just came in to wet our whistles.  The have a truck for drinks and a truck for some grub. They have the Stiegl Radler grapefruit beer and it went down very smoothly in the hot sun.  It would be very easy to sit and chill here for a couple of hours sipping cold drinks and eating some food.  The food looked good and the people eating it looked happy.  It is tucked away in an alley so parking can be an issue.  There is street parking but opted to go for the $4 all day parking.  There are other choices for food and drinks withing a stones throw but I highly recommend getting a drink here and soaking in the sun and the atmosphere.  After making the trek out of Burbank and having a great experience here I think I am going to make it a habit to come to this area or to come back here again.  I dare you, do it!< /text>< pics>

From what I hear the talent buyer changed and less metal/hard rock shows here which is a bummer. I want black metal brunch back there, now it's a dismal hipster joint for vapid hipster crock rock.<//review>

This is probably the worst venue in Los Angeles. The venue itself is tiny cramped and uncomfortable. The sound is horrendous and if you’re not standing in the front row you’re most likely not going to enjoy the show. The actual patio and outside legit feels twice as big as the actually venue which makes no sense when it feels like both should be switched. I’ve been here a few times due to an artist I really wanted to see performing here or a friend dragging me but every time I find myself so displeased by the Resident.</review>

This is probably the worst venue in Los Angeles. The venue itself is tiny cramped and uncomfortable. The sound is horrendous and if you’re not standing in the front row you’re most likely not going to enjoy the show. The actual patio and outside legit feels twice as big as the actually venue which makes no sense when it feels like both should be switched. I’ve been here a few times due to an artist I really wanted to see performing here or a friend dragging me but every time I find myself so displeased by the Resident.< /Text>

<review>A great location to catch some local acts from up and coming artists before they cost you an arm and a leg to get tickets for.  Great venue for music with a great outdoor patio for drinks and some truck food.< /review>< Pictures>

Best patio in LA, happy hour beer specials, but the mixed drinks are uneven at best and the beer selection is poorly curated.  Still, its a great vibe and I love going there (for 1 drink...), so 4 stars.<//Review>

I visited this place for the Micheal Jackson vs Prince experience. I had sooooo much fun. They were on time with the start up of the event and the pricing was resonable. For my experience alone 5 stars. As for the pricing on the drinks 3.8. Prices varied from $12-$15 each< /text>

<Review>Came for 90's Hip Hop Night. Waited outside for 30 minutes because there was a fight. Drinks are good but the layout is weak. Having the DJ right in front is the bar creates a bottlenose and it gets too congested.< /Review>< user_name>

This place... I don't hate it but I don't like it either. Thought there was gonna be a tiki bar, they had frozen painkillers. :/
The bartenders were kinda jerks. Have you ever seen those Starbucks memes where you ask for a large and the barista says oh you mean a venti?? YUP, that's the attitude of bartenders.
I do like the outside area, nice seating area.
Inside is whatever.. it's a shotgun type.

Depending on who is playing would really determine if I were to go back. If the band was playing somewhere else.. I'd rather go there.</Text>

Love this place!! One of the only spots in LA with enough bars to not be in line when yer favorite song comes on. Eats too?! Done!! Outdoor plenty patio space. Diverse crowd. Awesome security staff. Music is all depending on the DJ. I follow my boy DJ Dave Paul for his Prince & MJ Experience parties and STOMP. Best kept secrets in DTLA. Uber and Lyft dropoff and pickup friendly.<//Review>

While waiting for doors to open for band I came to see...we just chilled outside by the fire pits and had a few drinks in the open air patio. They have a food truck stationed outside along with a bar in like a converted SlipStream. The old fashioned was poured like a beer (premixed) but it tasted Ok and was good and strong so I’m ok with that. Can’t wait to go inside and enjoy the band. There’s a Urth Cafe across the street.  Valet parking on site. $10 to park...lots of street side parking that’s mostly full but I found a spot.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80c2c63c7774c2bb:0x8705bcc0cfb55713< /gmapID></record>

It's a nice place to chill, and I always enjoy the cider they serve there. The food they have is delicious, too.<//Review>

<text>If I work hard, with luck, one day I may be able to forget.

My friends and I came here for the Star Wars Tiki Brunch event, needless to say we didn’t expect
much but we were curious.

Let it be clear , you don’t call an event brunch if you start at noon, that’s just lunch... but whatever it doesn’t really matter.

They open and the only Star Wars decoration is an old cardboard cutout of 3PO and R2 at the entrance.
The tiki decorations were barely present too, I knew they weren’t gonna be tiki torches but at least more than a couple flower necklaces.

Despite the obvious themes of the “brunch”, there was NO Star Wars music nor any Hawaiian or polynesean music of any sort.

And it would all have been at least okay if getting food wasn’t near impossible.
Nearly a hundred persons for one food truck with less than ten choices. And they were the slowest service I’ve ever witness in my life. It took them 25 mins for just one order of fries and 40 minutes for a falafel. And the quality was nothing out of the ordinary.

This event was an insult to my person, my friends, to any Star Wars fan and honestly to the human race as a whole.</text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Damn I almost don't want to put a review because this place has the best layout and atmosphere PLUS the bartenders KNOW what's up. I have to give a shout-out to the Korean bartender I think named Brandon who is definitely good at what he does; this guy takes his job seriously (other Bartenders seem to take it seriously too). I recommend his old fashioned, it is so legit.

Great venue to bring a date to have a  chill night with some drinks and music. The outdoor area basically feels like a backyard hangout with pretty lights that girls like. When you bring a date start out in the quiet outside area where you can talk and connect with your date, then take her/him to the game area throw some sand bags around and get that bond with some high fives, next grab a beer outside in the beer garden or get some liquor inside from the great bartenders before casually dancing and bumpin' yo head to the music until ya'll are buzzed, and I suggest finishing up with a kiss in one of the corners inside.

The crowd is very hipster and friendly, good mix of people of all races, just a great friendly, chill venue with great drinks. I recommend it, I am definitely coming back with my GF when we need a quality bartender without crazy high prices.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Cool location with a refreshing beer selection and very tasty snacks. A detour in the evening is definitely worth it. Smoking allowed in the courtyard.

Coole Location mit erfrischender Bier Auswahl und sehr leckeren Snacks. Ein Abstecher am Abend lohnt sich auf jeden Fall. Rauchen im Innenhof erlaubt.</review>
