Ted and all the guys (and girls in the office) have always been super helpful and accommodating. I took my 1990 Honda to them and they kept her running like a champ and now with my 2016 Chevy Cruze, they’re the only shop I trust. Ted is very fair and stands behind all of his employees and their work.

I had a bolt in my tire this last time I went in and because I bought my tires with them, he not only fixed that tire (and also found a nail in another after he inspected them) but I got a brand new tire free of charge (plus they repaired the other tire). But that’s just one example. I couldn’t tell you how many time I’ve had a car emergency and they’ve helped immensely.  And not only me but everyone in my family takes their vehicles to Dixon Tire Pro’s.

So, If you’re new to town or just looking for a new mechanic, I highly recommend going to see these guys. I recommend them every time
I’m asked for anything vehicle repair related. I’ll be a life long customer, no questions asked.< /Review>

<text>I see this store has a 4.9 star rating.  I chose to change the tires and repair the car here to do four-wheel alignment.  The boss is very responsible and friendly.  Although the price is slightly beyond my budget, the price is reasonable.< /text>< Pictures>

<Rate>2<//Rate><Review>I had 2 tires shipped to them from Tire Rack. Appointment for 11am on a Saturday. I was 10 minutes late - service person said it would take 1.5 to 2 hours to complete because I was late. 2 hours go by and they haven't even started on my vehicle. As a compromise I offered to leave the vehicle with them and pick it up next business day and pay for an Uber to get back to my house, because I couldn't sit there all day waiting. Can't get Uber due to busy Saturday and my house is slightly rural. I asked about the shuttle service, but they said they won't go outside of city limits, even though it's only 15 minutes from their shop - it's Dixon, it's a rural town, many people live outside of city limits. So I took my 2 tires and left, and I probably won't come back. They were nice enough, hence 2 stars, but the smart thing to do from a customer service standpoint would have been to just make an exception on the shuttle service, after I waited 2 hours with an appointment, rather than lose my business altogether. If me being 10 minutes late really made that big of a difference, they should have rescheduled on the spot - not told me 2 hours to finish it and then they haven't even started after 2 hours. It just felt like me being a few minutes late was the perfect excuse for poor service, and I wasted half my Saturday for nothing. I own 4 vehicles, and I also work in customer service so I know the difference between good and bad - after this poor experience most likely I'll never come back so that's a lot of my business that they're losing.<//Review>< Pics>

Went here to get my exhaust done and the friendly people over at Dixon tire pro got to work in no time. Eric did the work on my exhaust and he actually finished earlier than expected and did a great job! Will not hesitate to come back here again! Def a 5 starts from me. Go see Eric if you need your exhaust work done<//text>

In this day and age of everyone trying to make a fast buck it’s refreshing to deal with a group of people that still believe in total customer service. You can tell that this starts with Ted. I would recommend Dixon Tire pros to anyone that needed auto repairs.

<review>I've been there several times with multiple vehicles and they've treated me great every time! I've taken multiple vehicles (Hyundai, Toyota, Jeep) to them and they've been professional every single time.  The Jeep had a cracked engine block that was burning coolant but didn't know it at the time. I took it multiple times and after each time there was no charge because they were trying to figure out the problem.  After they finally did figure out it was a cracked engine block, the owner paid for my rental cars without me asking.  I would definitely recommend them to anyone in the area!< /review>< Pictures>

I do the majority of my car repairs at home so I know when I’ve found a great mechanic.  I have been sending all of my work vehicles here for years and personal vehicles if the need arises.  Ted and Andrew have always been great about scheduling, shuttle trips, and explaining exactly what repairs are being done and why.  Roberto did some work on my personal truck and was thorough, knowledgeable, and invited me back mid repair to show me additional items he found that needed attention.  On several occasions tire pros has found that requested repairs were not needed, and they have prioritized customer service over making money.  The few times a repair has been outside their area of expertise they have not hesitated to suggest an alternative shop.  An honest shop that stands by their work, thank you Tire Pros.<//Review>

Edit (addressing owner's response, 8/23/18):
The owner's reply states that "we discussed a course of action to take for the damage". When I took my car back in the next day to tell them about the damage, they seemed willing to pay to get the damage fixed but said were too busy and didn't have any lifts free. They told me to come back the following day so they could look at the damage. The next day I went back, the technician put my car up on one of their lifts, and looked over the damage. After multiple people inspected the damage, they told me it was "superficial" and that "sometimes low cars scrape going up the ramps" so they weren't going to cover it.

This response is too little and 2 months too late. I fixed this myself a long time ago.

6/20/2018:
I hit a large pothole and my alignment slipped enough to make steering wheel crooked when driving in a straight line. Based on all of the positive reviews, I decided to get my car aligned at Dixon Tire Pros. My experience was far from positive.

Making an appointment was easy enough, the waiting room was nice, and the employees were professional. I was told the alignment would take 45 minutes to 1 hour so I decided to wait. It ended up taking 2 hours but they were very busy so the extra time is understandable. Up to this point I was totally satisfied with the service I received.

When I got home I went under my car to mark the alignment cams so I could put them back myself if they slipped again and that's when I noticed the damage. The exhaust was scraped up, there were scratches on the subframe, and the driver's side frame rail was noticeably dented (see picture, the frame rail should be straight along the red line).

I brought my car back in to get them to fix it or at least give me some sort of compensation so I could get it fixed myself but even though they admitted that they damaged the car, they said the damage was "superficial" and that "sometimes low cars scrape going up the ramps". First, just because nothing actually broke and the damage was "superficial" doesn't mean that it is acceptable. What if a door got dented or paint got scratched? Is that superficial damage acceptable? Second, my car has more ground clearance than a Camaro, an Audi S5, and many other cars. If your shop can't handle sports cars then don't offer to work on them!

Dixon Tire Pros may usually have good service when everything goes right but so do a lot of other places. A truly good shop takes care of their customer when things go wrong as well. If you decide to try this place, make sure to take lots of pictures of your car beforehand just in case. I am seriously disappointing in the service I received and would recommend you go somewhere else.<//text>

"Personal services" like waxing are now open, at last...which means I can finally get my brows done regularly (or at least semi-regularly) again!

I understand the staff wants to keep things non-contact as much as possible; which is why they've introduced a new check-in process. Text an "I've arrived!" message to the QR code/phone number on the front door, and the staff will respond when they're clean and ready for your appt. (They do ask that customers don't enter until they've received the confirmation text.)
The one thing I found kind of odd was the laminated printout of COVID symptoms - after a temperature check, the reception staff literally put out a sheet in front of them, arms out, and ask you to read through the symptoms. (Quickly, like within 10 seconds) I totally get that we aren't supposed to be in close quarters with strangers right now, but the whole 'Stop, arms out'  stance seemed a bit awkward. Anyway, they're just doing their jobs.

Carissa, my waxer, gave me a great simple brow wax (just cleaned them up) with no fuss. She was friendly, and put me at ease. I hear awesome things about Abigail, too but it seems she's pretty booked...< /text>< Time>

Neat, clean, efficient. People know what they are doing and they are good at it. Front desk staff are polite and nice. It's a well run operation with no frills (it's not a spa. You are going to get waxed and they will do that quickly and efficiently). They use hard wax which is nice. Abigail is fabulous and always booked out. More expensive than some places but worth it for the more sensitive areas.<//text>

I have been a client here for over 2 years. They are professional, clean, and friendly. They do an amazing job. They make you feel comfortable and they always have great wax package deals. If this is going to be your first time getting a Brazilian or really any wax ask for Abigail at this location! She is so nice and professional!<//text>

EWC may be more expensive than other places, but it's definitely worth it. This location is pretty standard - decent parking, small waiting area. It was very busy when I went so I had to wait longer than I normally do, but I was still in and out in 30 minutes. Abigail was great - I highly recommend choosing her as your esthetician!< /Text>

Mariana is the best! I have been to a few different wax places in Santa Cruz and Palo Alto. None compare. She is professional, friendly and efficient. It doesn't hurt which is a huge plus. She has a great technique and never leaves random hairs. She has a warm and bubbly personality which I appreciate very much. I highly recommend her for any waxing service. Again, she is the best!<//text>

<Review>If you haven't tried European Wax Center, you have to get over here!!! ESPECIALLY if u are still going someplace that uses strips. I have very sensitive skin and the wax doesn't bother me. Everyone is extremely friendly from the front desk to the wax specialists. I've been coming to the Mountain View location since they opened and have always had a great experience. I also recommend the wax passes, they save a lot of money. The are guy friendly too.< /Review>< pics>

My issue is with the front desk staff. I had an appointment and I walk in the door, I gave both ladies my first and last name. They are both silent. One looks at the other and finally she decided to look at me and acknowledge my standing there. There was a good minute of nothing. Horrible experience with the front desk staff.< /Text>

I've been coming to European wax at Mountain View for 3 and a half years, month after month. I buy the pass and am a loyal customer. I LOVE Debonie, let's get that straight. This 1 star review is for their 9 minute cancellation policy and their terrible customer service. I drove in traffic today from San Jose in extremely stressful conditions, trying my best to make sure I reached before the 9 minute cut off. Google maps kept fluctuating my ETA between 9 and 10 mins. I called 20 minutes in advance, informing them that I will be potentially 1 minute late: the girl kept repeating that the appointment with be cancelled if I don't reach within 9 minutes. I KNOW THAT and that's why I called! I asked if she could make an allowance and check me in since I will literally reach at the 9th minute. She said she can't do that. I drove like a maniac and reached at the 9th minute and my appointment was cancelled. It was at 5:45 and she's saying that the next appointment is at 7:30. Are you kidding me? You expect me to sit around till then?? This is unbelievable. I'm so disappointed that I will have to search for a new waxer. It's a total shame because I love visiting Debonie, she truly is the best waxer and a great human being, period. European wax does not value loyal customers and have not trained their receptionists on good customer service. I'll be taking my money elsewhere. Hoping I can get a refund for the 12-month pass that I prepaid for.< /review>

I went on a Friday when they said that to be attend I needed to wait over than 40 minutes, so we rebooked for a Sunday 11:45 and they would not charge anything for the service because of what happened.

On Sunday the attendance was poor, my eyebrows and lips were not made correctly, leaving a lot of hairs I had to remove at home, besides burning a part of my eyebrow that took more than two weeks to leave, to my surprise they charged me . I sent an email and got no response yet.< /review>

Honestly really irritated with this waxing place right now. I went in for the free first time waxing this week to get my eyebrows done. I let them know that my skin was incredibly sensitive and that the more lotion and what not they put on my brows the worse it would be. They insisted that it would be fine and all of their products were so fantastic and great for sensitive skin. I left and now today I have bumps all over my f&)&Ing eyebrows😡.

Also the whole experience felt like I was in a sales pitch. A bit aggressive with the way they tried to sell you products<//Review>

<text>Wow, it was amazing here!
Was recommended by a friend and I don't want to go back to any other waxing place again. Ariel did my eyebrows for free (first timers get free eyebrow wax) and explained everything to me, before, during, and after. I really felt pampered. Also, I've never seen the type of wax they used but it is the best! Doesn't hurt as much(: I'm impressed and coming back soon!

Courtesy clerk was also very professional and helpful.</text>< Pics>

After my answer, she said that she won't do wax because my hairs are not long enough. She even did't look at them. She told me to change date of visit and sent me to reception. Receptionist went to talk to beautician and when she came back she told me that I can only change the date because beautician told her that she saw hair and they're to shot what was a lie because beautician did't give me a chance to undress. In the end receptionist told me that on Tuesday manager will contact with me to discuss situation but it never happened. Customer service in this place is terrible. I wasted my time in this place and guess what, other salon hadn't any problem to do brazilian bikini with my hair.

I don't recommend this place if you want to be treated with respect to client.</text></record>

This used to be my favorite location, their waxers always did a great job. I have been in three times the past two weeks because  of appointment issues. Twice they put me on the schedule for a time different from what they told me. Yesterday they kept telling me it would be "a few more minutes", and after waiting  twenty I finally gave up.

The manager was more concerned with stocking product than addressing my concerns. Yesterday the front desk staff said they were running behind because there was "drama in the back." The professionalism of this location has gone downhill, so I will not be returning.</text>

I love the customer service here. APRIL is an excellent waxer with a lot of experience and knowledge about skin. All of the other gals are great too! Wax is super general and the products work great!</review>

I came in on a 3 day weekend and they were closed but Eduardo came in to open the store for a customer with an emergency repair.  I showed up as a first time customer and was treated like a regular.  He helped me with my order and showed me the best options and was patient with my questions.  Great prices and even better service.  You have a loyal customer for life and will recommend to anyone in the area needing your products.</review>

This company has the best customer service. I ordered 2 pipes and they were delivered the next day! Anthony even helped me carry them up to my garden. Wonderful company to work with and very friendly, professional staff. I highly recommend using them for your projects.</review>

I believe that I previously rated this establishment, but other than the fact that this ARCO is very busy...they are up to the demand! Clerks are knowledgeable & can speed along your visit even when they are busy!< /Text>

2nd arco station that I gassed up in on my trip. Most horrific bathroom imaginable. Even sent off email to corporate and no response. These places are fountain soda and snack stops along with gas. Hold in your urge and go somewhere else. I never write such bad reviews but this was bad.<//Review>

Very nice store with multiple shops all located in a single building establishment. The shop includes a gas station, a fabulous luncheon dine in mini restaurant, snack shop, and fast reliable service< /Review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>On 10/02/2016, 10:04 h, I slipped my debit card at the pump #07 of the gas station ARCO #42041, 1701 BRUNDAGE LANE, BAKERSFIELD, CA 93304. When I just pressed the trigger of the nozzle to start filling my tank, the tube disconnected off the pump and the gasoline started to flow all over the floor and under my car. I yelled to a gas station employee but she got in inside to call the manager. I replaced the nozzle to the pump by myself, getting a lot of gasoline over my arm and the pump stopped. The manager come with the employee to try fix the pump. They could not. He not even gave me an excuse. I got in inside the station and the cashier told me that she would refund me on next day. I moved to another pump to fill in my tank. They did not refund me the value of US$ 6.81 charged by nothing but trouble and life risk. My car remained smelling gasoline for almost 3 days.</review>< pics>

For the passed year Ive been bringing my recyclables here and I totally recommend this place. Even if there’s a lot customers, they get you in & out super quick. The employees are very helpful & their Customer service is really good. Thank You & Happy Holidays!<//Review>

Quick transaction, I was in and out in about 5 minutes on a weekday. I did only have 2 large bags. I unloaded into the bin, they scanned through the bottles, weighed. Got a receipt and got cash next door.</review>

It's a busy place. Waited 20 min around lunch & couldn't figure out what I should do. Came back 2 hrs later and drove right up. Very easy and the employees were so nice. Don't forget to tip! These guys work hard.<//Text>

I have been recycling here for more than 10 years.  The staff are always friendly and efficient and the owner is always working along side of them, which I think is great. I always try to sort my CRV items before arriving at any recycling center.  This helps the process to be quicker and  less frustrating. The parking area at this location is small so can easily get congested by people parking/sorting where they please. If you fluster or are annoyed easily, like myself, then consider sorting before arriving, as well.</review>

Been going to this place since 2013.  They stay pretty up to date on their prices, and they can accommodate most anything you bring in.  They used to accept appliances but as of today " 9-17-20 " they no longer accept them.  Separate area for bringing in can and bottles as opposed to heavier loads, so there isn't much of a wait time.  A lot of places are closing down due to Covid and not being able to scrap, but this place has stood strong.   If you have recycling, support your local business and go here.<//Review>

I parked off to the side because I had not separated my cans and bottles, to not bog down the line. When I was done, one of the employees dragged 4 of my cans while I dragged 1 across the lot to the scales, then he ran back and dragged my last one over as well. I left them a tip for sure.< /review>

You might not expect to find great service and friendly people working at a place like this. What I mean is that the crew is working pretty hard moving all this metal around all day and even at the end of the day they are still pretty happy to be dealing with the general public. It is always enjoyable to work with the guys.</Text>

Been coming here for almost 10 yrs & always have a great experience. They always help me unload my car AND helps empty my bags . The girls in the office are always nice & the woman weighing cans always brings you in to show you what your #'s are - most other places just grunt & hand you a receipt.</text>

The people here are so nice & friendly. The guys help me take my bottles & cans out of my truck. Once my truck died as I was leaving & they jump started my truck which they did not have to do. The girls inside are just as friendly.</Review>

I highly recommend to all my friends and family. Ivanna, PA-C has the perfect combination of ambition, creativity, technical expertise that make her a savvy PA plastic surgeon. She has the ability to establish a good rapport with virtually anyone she comes into contact with and her can- do attitude allowed this to be a pleasant experience.< /text>

My experience with Orange county plastic surgery has been amazing. I love the staff and Dr Bunkis is my all time favorite. He is as talented as he is charming . He makes himself available anytime of day or night to answer any questions you may have. He has made me feel like I am so beautiful and special and has taken care of all my cosmetic need since 2010.< /review>

When you are the "Groupon" purchaser, sometimes you get the quick, low-quality service, but since my first call all the way to leaving, I felt very well taken care of and was treated with the highest level of customer care and kindness. I highly recommend Dr. Bunkis and his staff! I received the IPL facial and it has done wonders with my brown spots from sun damage!< /text>

<text>I saw physician’s assistant, Crystal Osborn, for a micro needling procedure. Crystal is a very knowledgeable and skilled PA professional. I felt very secure in her care; she was very patient with me as I weighed out the options of treatments. I originally was scheduled for Botox but I really wanted something more natural that would allow my own body to produce the collagen itself.

We discussed the procedure and I decided on the micro-needling instead. Crystal did an excellent job with the actual procedure and with the after care instructions. Everything went exactly as she said and even after only 1 session I’ve seen smoother tighter skin and less fine lines.

I highly recommend Orange County Plastic Surgery Associates and Crystal in particular. The entire office staff was very professional, patient and accommodating. The office is beautiful and immaculately clean.<//text>< name>

I have been with Dr. Bunkis for 6+ years I will never ever go to anyone else. He’s an amazing soul and he is so thorough. He loves his patients and will never do a procedure if he thinks you don’t need it. I love him, I love his staff, I love the facility, I love the surgery center, I love the nurses. I can go on and on about my experience. I have taken my mom there and she’s had a few procedures done with Dr. Bunkis she looks amazing and feels so good. His work is unbelievable, he makes you feel so good about yourself and gives you back all the self confidence you lost. His hands are magic to me. I always look better and better.

Dr. Bunkis recently performed a abdominoplasty with muscle  repair,  liposuction to my abdomen, flanks and back. Dr. Bunkis and his staff especially Jo were so helpful, comforting and responsive throughout the entire process. Any questions and issues I ever had were immediately addressed, and I was always encouraged to inquire anytime I had problems/questions (including weekends). This was my first experience with plastic surgery, so I had some hesitancy, but Dr. Bunkis and staff really normalized the entire experience, making me feel supported and giving me a very positive experience. Dr. Bunkis is serious about about his work and he cares about his patients. You honestly tell he loves what he does. [Single best thing is...] The result!! When I look down, I see a flat stomach and no rolls!!</review>

Dr. Bunkis is a great man. He and his team (of beauties) were very comforting, helpful and knowledgeable. I would recommend Dr.B and his team of professionals to anyone. I’ll be returning for sure. And, you won’t be disappointed with that level of expertise if you decide to get a procedure. ❤️< /text>

<username>Kayla Rodriguez<//username><Text>Had my very first experience with lasers--tried the Laser Genesis or lunch break laser facial as it is often referred. Crystal Osborn is fantastic! She walked me through the procedure and discussed my skin concerns. She has such a calming and professional presence, I had not realized she started the procedure. It is literally painless and pretty quick! You feel a warming sensation, kind of like you're in a tanning bed. I felt extremely relaxed the entire time. Here we are now a week after the procedure and my skin looks vibrant and glowing. I can't wait to come back for more treatments! I have been wanting to try IPL because of my primary skin concerns and have seen the results, but have been nervous due to down time. However, this is the place I would trust to take care of me!

What I appreciated even more than the procedure and initial results was the genuine outpouring of kindness from the entire staff. I sent a little thank you email the following day and the entire team at OCPS, including Dr. Bunkis himself, replied to me individually to thank me for being a patient. I was very impressed and will definitely be coming back!< /Text>< response>

What other can I say about this wonderful office other than.. THANK YOU!
Dr. Bunkis is an amazing plastic surgeon. Professional, punctual, and tentative.
I went in for a breast augmentation, and over all the experience and staff was great.
I got everything I asked for with my new breast's and I couldn't be happier.
He listened to what I wanted, gave me the best suggestion, ended up more thrilled with the results.

I would recommend the office to anyone trying to achieve a new look.
Knowledgeable, certified, and friendly!< /Text>

Absolutely the most wonderfully caring people associated with Dr. Bunkis. He and his staff are caring and knowledgeable. I never had any doubts about my treatment and surgery. I am very pleased with the outcome. I would love to recommend them to my friends, but they all live out of state. I would like to thank Colette for her personal help with everything.</Review>

Looking for a caring, concerned doctor who also is a straight talker and does a quality job? Your search stops here! I have been a patient of Dr. B for the last 4-5 years. He is the only one I would trust to do any type of cosmetic surgery. Even my family didn't know that I had work done because it was so natural looking. His attention to detail and combination of art and science make him my doctor of choice!</Review>

I came in for an IPL treatment on my face. It was my first time ever doing any kind of cosmetic treatment, so I was nervous. The girl at the front was very approachable and easy to talk to. Crystal did my treatment, and she was so thorough and made sure I understood everything that was going to happen. Overall, it was a great experience, and I would highly recommend.<//Text>

No matter what he does it is perfect in every way !! He knows his stuff ! And does it well!! Look up his work online and you will see what I am talking about !! Need plastic surgery? He is absolutely the only doctor I would ever go to or recommend for you to go to!! I cannot thank him enough, he goes above and beyond what one would expect!

<review>I first looked at another office for and after a short consultation, left almost in tears by how pressured and uncomfortable the other surgeon made me feel. I called Dr. Bunkis' office to set up a consultation and even just in making this appointment, I knew that this was the office for me. Every person who works in this office is warm and friendly and kind. Dr. Bunkis did not pressure me to get surgery. He gave me facts and options and told me that it was my choice. He emailed me his resume and we discussed all of the possible treatment options to consider. Completely pressure free. My surgery was painless and easy. Every step of the way, I felt comfortable. Every question I asked had an answer. Both Dr. Bunkis and Crystal are highly knowledgable and will give you their honest opinions on products and procedures. The whole office will remember you and you will feel welcome each time you come in.
This was a huge financial and medical decision for me and I felt safe, comfortable, and welcome through my entire process. Honestly, this is a great practice and I cannot recommend it enough. 6/5 stars< /review>< pictures>

<Review>I love Dr. Bunkis and I am so grateful for him. Dr. Bunkis is a Harvard educated Plastic Surgeon who is highly skilled what sets him apart from other top surgeons is that he genuinely cares for his patients - he treats you like family.  My most recent surgery with Dr. Bunkis has been for skin cancer and he has had me come back for five checkups . My last appointment was this past week and he was satisfied when he did his exam - you would not notice my scar unless you  deliberately focused on that section of skin. He is highly skilled , compassionate and caring. He is the best.<//Review>< pictures>

My experience with Dr. Bunkis and his staff has been a very positive one.  I have had three surgeries done my Dr. B...two were elective and one was needed to remove a small lump in my breast. I could not have been more happy with my results and with the caring manner in which I was treated by him and his staff.  They always have made me feel more than welcome.  I have referred Dr.Bunkis to many of my friends whom have had surgeries and all have been very happy.< /review>

I'm no stranger to cosmetic surgery, so my 5-Star assessment is truly representative of my appreciation for Dr. Bunkiss and his wonderful staff. I have utmost respect for not only his surgical skills, but also for the entire team 's friendliness and concern. Any trepidation I had about my procedures was quickly allayed and my results are terrific. I wholeheartedly recommended OCPS!< /Review>

<review>I am happy with my results.  My insurance company made this more of a task for me that I feel it ever should have been.  This is not the office's fault, however I will give my quick run down....

I was told by Aetna, that I needed to see one of there providers, of which two names were given.  I went to one in Laguna Beach they tried to up-sell like and tell me how I should get these other procedures done.  I reviewed their work and asked the simple question of how many belphs had they done.  They could not answer and the pictures they had we obviously touched up.  They claimed it was lighting.....

I shopped around a bit and in Newport there is a lot to select from.  Some of these guys state appointments months out and claimed it to be just that busy....come to find out some of these guys are not full time.

So I went to Dr. Bunkis -- who is out of my network, but had really good pictures on his site.  I asked him how many he did and had a full catalog of eyes, plus at-least two of his staffers.  The results looked amazing.  I considered the price difference from in network to out of network, then very quickly  decided on Dr. Bunkis.  Great guy, great personality, and a no BS personality.  The answers were spot on, when I asked about what the Aetna Dr recommended, he quickly pointed out the flaws (ie feminizing the face ---as a guy NOT what I would want).  I also asked about some other body work and he recommended a book by Ornish that gave some fixes via diet --- (actually he gave me his copy) --- It appears to work).

Back to the procedure -- All good the surgical center was next door --- they were nice, and professional, very comfortable.  The Anesthesiologist was easy going.  Everything went as described.  All good.

Dr. Bunkis followed up over the weekend, gave me his cell phone number  for any issues (of which I called and he answered).  I was a bit nervous as after you do a bleph, you get a bit of distorted vision.  Dr. Bunkis put my unease at rest.  And here I  am a few weeks later and my results look day and night better.

The follow ups were little wait and very easy going.  Collette and Jo have been awesome in helping me process the Aetna PPO self claim papers.  Really good guys.

Dr. Bunkis is very approachable and has an amazing story.  I am very glad to have found him and am proud to give an endorsement of him to my friends.

What could have made this better.....Well the office was near perfect.....Aenta on the other hand - not so much......I see why so few would be in there network.  I will also go so far as to say if you are looking in network, the cost savings is not that significant  and I found value with going with someone I indubiously trust.</review>< Pics>

Everyone is so friendly, caring, personable and so accommodating.  I had my eyes, face and neck done. One week after my surgery, I had one bruise left to deal with and some redness in my neck. I did not wear any make-up and went about my day like usual.  People have seen me and could not tell that I had gone through a  major surgery a week ago.  They just thought that I looked great and refreshed.  No visible scars showing except for  inconspicuous lines on my eyelids which will totally disappear very soon. I have Dr. Bunkis to thank for that.  He is a very talented artist in his own world, and has mastered the art of plastic surgery. Dr. Bunkis called the day after my surgery to check on me. He replies to all his emails, and when he is not at the office, you can call him or text him on his personal cell phone.  He surely and truthfully care about his patients and the results.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80dceba5e9d0b439:0x8039a73656c31b3f</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I have had a couple of surgeries by Dr. Bunkis, and he is amazing!  He is so kind very knowledgeable and doesn't try to get you to do anything that you don't need. I have asked him several times over a couple of years,  I wanted my eyes done  he would say, " you don't need It".  Later finally he agreed to do my eyes Yeah!!!   I'm so please with the outcome, people are asking me what have I done I look great.

What I really admirer about Dr. Bunkis that he doesn't prescribe you so many pain pills.   Being in recovery he prescribe me a non-narcotic that really just help the pain. The office staff are the best, they are so sweet and welcoming. Dr Bunkis and his staff are the best. I have referred several people to him and they have had a great experience....< /Text>

Dr. Bunkis has been my plastic surgeon for nearly 7 years. I met Dr. Bunkis through a friend, who went to him as well for plastic surgery. She couldn't speak highly enough of Orange County Plastic Surgery. I've always gone to him for maintenance (Botox, Juvederm, Laser Treatments). 3 years ago, I had a nose job and a little radio frequency tightening of my jawline. He is one of the only plastic surgeon's in Newport Beach that will do a closed rhinoplasty. He specifically, focused on the tip of my nose as I wanted it a little more refined and less bulbous. It couldn't have turned out better. I was up and around the next day and 3 years later, I think it's still perfect. Nose jobs definitely improve with time as you heal. Recently, I have been feeling that I look tired, getting older, and starting to droop in my eyelids and that my lower face was sagging. I've talked on and off with Dr. Bunkis about having surgery to correct this for 2 years now. The timing was finally right, and after consulting with Dr. Bunkis and Colette, I scheduled a trans-blepharoplasty brow lift and face lift on January 3, 2018. Today is January 10, 2018. I cannot believe it has been 10 days since I had a brow lift and face lift. I went to dinner with my Mother last night. Nobody was staring. We went and ran errands and I felt completely confident being out in public. I got my stitches out a week after my surgery. People will tell you that facial surgery doesn't hurt and that it's a breeze. That's not necessarily true and it depends a lot on which plastic surgeon you choose. I can tell you that his pre-operative and post-operative instructions are almost as critical as the procedures he performs. I had this facelift and brow lift to kind of stop the aging process as I enter a birthday I didn't want to celebrate this year. And I knew that Dr. Bunkis wouldn't leave me looking pulled tight or like a deer caught in the headlights. He takes a very personalized approach when he consults with you. And also will tell you if you shouldn't do something. I find this comforting because he doesn't believe in fixing things that aren't broken.  I told Dr. Bunkis that if I didn't look any better than I did 10 days post-op, that I was as happy as a clam. I truly can't believe how natural and youthful I look. I'm not one to shy away from having plastic surgery to reverse the aging process and I certainly don't mind sharing my experiences going under the knife. What I can tell you is that the first few days of a facelift and brow lift are a little uncomfortable. You've got tubes for drainage on the first day. Which is great, because you don't have all that fluid and blood sitting in your lower face and neck. You are swollen as you would be with any surgery. Ice, ice, ice, and ice some more! Dr. Bunkis also recommended that I sit up at an elevated position when I slept as much as I could and to sleep on my back. Some people won't do that. I can tell you that it's one of the best pieces of advice he gave me for recovery. Yes, it's not ideal to sleep with your head elevated and on your back. But it's so worth it to cut your recovery time literally in half! And it's your FACE! Don't slack and cut corners on his recovery instructions. I did feel tightness around my ears which is normal I think given that's where the stitches are and the muscle is repositioned. I wouldn't say it was painful, rather it felt like pressure that would come and go and dissipated over the first week. 10 days out and I'm slightly numb in a couple of spots, but it's nothing that would prevent me from doing anything I would normally do. If you are thinking about having plastic surgery, without any hesitation I recommend him to family and friends. He doesn't have a one size fits all approach to anything. My Mother has had a facelift, brow lift, upper and lower eyelids, and breast lift with Dr. Bunkis in 2017. She loves her results, too. If you want the best plastic surgeon in Newport Beach, go to Dr. Bunkis! I've never felt more confident. You won't regret it.</review>

Orange County Plastic Surgery and Dr. Bunkis came highly recommended to me. Recently I went in for a consultation with Dr. Bunkis. I had a wonderful experience. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  Dr. Bunkis was thorough and took the time to go over the procedures I was interested in. He explained each procedure and how it would be done. Jo was professional, courteous and so helpful in explaining in detail the financials to me.  I was so impressed that I've decided to go with Dr. Bunkis for my surgery. While I was there I elected to have the Sculpsure therapy done on my abdomen. His PA Crystal does an amazing job with the Sculpsure, she’s got such an amazing personality that it made the experience that much more enjoyable. Crystal made sure I was always informed about the process. She's gentle and makes you feel comfortable while giving great results. I highly recommend Dr. Bunkis and his staff to all my family and friends.< /text>

<Text>Dr. Bunkis did my breast augmentation and I also go to him for Botox. I am very satisfied with the results of my surgery and I'm stunned at how natural my breasts still look! Dr. Bunkis truly cares about the welfare of his patients and even called me personally after my surgery to check on me. He is incredibly kind and has a very gentle bedside manner. He is just not like most doctors I've met in the way that he cares for his patients. Everyone in the office is very friendly and accommodating as well. I would recommend him to anyone....I actually already have sent two friends there and both loved him as well!<//Text><Response>{'time': 1453739714763, 'text': 'Hi Jackey:\n\nWe really appreciate your feedback and are so happy to hear that you are pleased with your results.

Plastic surgery is widely discussed in modern times in both positive and negative light. My experience, as a 60 years old female with a facelift done 4 years ago, has brought only positive feelings and thoughts to my life. All this became possible though, because of the skills and knowledge of my plastic surgeon Dr. Bunkis. Everything from the surgery itself to the healing process exceeded my expectations. Dr. Bunkis took away the signs of aging from my eyes, forehead, jaw line and neck in just one procedure. There were no complications and no real pain. After the discomfort in the first 1-2 days was gone, I went out for dinner on day 3 and on day 8 flew back to my home town of Chicago. The best of all though, is that Dr. Bunkis didn't change the expression of my face and after healing was complete, I saw then and see now the same me, but without what time and gravity had done to my face. If you are reading this, it means you are interested in the services Dr. Bunkis can offer. I would recommend to trust him for his qualifications and talent and make a gift to yourself by choosing Dr. Bunkis to take care of your needs. And trust my words as well, because I am a real patient of his and he made me happy!<//Review>

I cannot say enough good things about Dr. Bunkis and his girls. I love them! Dr. Bunkis is personable, warm, and listens to our needs and desires. I came in for a facelift, and one month later, I look 20 years younger! It's so exciting! The level of care at OCPS is unsurpassed! Colette is an angel, and Crystal and the girls are as well. I feel like family. But the best part? I am in my 60's but a few days ago someone guessed me to be 45! Dr. Bunkis, thank you for giving me a second chance! I am eternally grateful! Love, Debi Wilson<//text>

<text>I would highly recommend Dr. Juris Bunkis for any procedure you may be considering. He performed a facelift and breast reduction on me. I could not be more pleased,  not only in my opinion is he the best in his business, but he is a compassionate human being.
He came to me as a highly recommended surgeon, but through all of our meetings, and there were many,  he has become a great and trusted friend.
You get to know Dr. Bunkis on a personal level because it's a very sensitive subject, at least it was for me. I must also give credit to his staff they were always there for me… And Dr. Bunkis was never too busy.   I can't sing his praises enough, he is simply the best!

Dr Juris Bunkis MD FACS I highly recommend Dr Bunkis he is a highly skilled surgeon , who sincerely cares about his patients . He is the only highly specialized surgeon I have gone to that doesn't keep you waiting in an over scheduled Dr.'s office , you are taken in right on time . And he is a gifted surgeon . Recently Dr.Bunkis biopsied a growth on my chest that turned out to be cancerous and he removed a small chunk of tissue with the needed margins and sewed the skin back together so perfectly it looks like a scratch - an amazing skill. If you want the best outcome for any needed or wanted surgical procedures I know you will be very pleased with your outcome with Dr Bunkis.< /review>

Dr. Bunkis and his team at Orange County Plastic Surgery were exceptional to work with!
I had an IPL treatment done and was more then taken care of. Dr.Bunkis also removed 2 moles for me and the results are all that I was hoping for and more. He was very kind and knowledgeable. I recommend using him for your next or first procedure. I am defiantly looking forward to using him again.
Thanks Dr. Bunkis!</Text>

Dr. Bunkis is total excellant physician that does extroidinary work.  I have had a facelift that I am thrilled with and keeps me feeling better about myself.  As we age we want to look as good as we feel.  Never do we want to look like we are pulled so tightly but want to look natural.  I would recommend him to anyone and in fact I do.< /Review>

<text>I visited Dr. Bunkis to try a procedure I was curious about called ThermiVa.  I currently work as an aesthetic nurse and am based in the Bay Area, but I was on vacation and wanted to try out this procedure and see if it would be a good fit for our office.

The office is beautiful, centrally located, and I was greeted promptly by the reception. I was taken back to a treatment room where I changed into a robe and made myself comfortable. Dr. Bunkis' wife came in the room as "chaperone" and after a very thorough explanation of the procedure and what to expect we got started.

The whole treatment lasted approximately 30 minutes and was painless and easy. The result was noticed immediately afterward and it is an incredible difference. Dr. Bunkis recommended that I do an additional 2 treatments for best results which I fully intend to do. I was on the fence about the whole thing, but I am so happy that I did it and can say that just after one treatment my sex life and confidence has improved. You're worth it, ladies.

As I work in the industry and have worked with several plastic surgeons over the years, I would not hesitate to recommend Dr. Bunkis and his staff for all of your aesthetic treatment needs. It was a positive experience that I will forever by grateful that I experienced. You are in good hands with this office and they even recommended some great restaurants and things to do while I was in the area.

Stop hesitating and start taking care of yourself in the way that you deserve. Make an appointment today - you'll be glad that you did.</text>< gmap_id>

<review>Dr. Bunkis is an Elite Artisan, is sincerely the most caring surgeon and his work is so superb you do not question it!

I have seen 2 of Dr. Bunkis's facelift patients while at his office (while waiting for my apts w/Dr. Bunkis). I was so incredibly impressed! Living in S. Ca. you can sometimes see that people have had "work" even if it is good "work". The 2 patients that I saw that had facelifts look so naturally beautiful that I would never in a million years have suspected they had a facelift.  One patient was 3 weeks out of surgery. His work is what I would describe as being so natural the patient looks like the best version of themselves. I could not even attempt to guess the age of the patients either.. They just look beautiful and a beautiful that you don't question.  That says it all really -- Unquestioningly beautiful! When people can see you have work or suspect you've had work there is a reason a trace of something that is just not right.. The patients that I saw were just so beautiful that I just commented to myself as to what lovely people they looked like. I also think that because his work is not detectable that men should highly consider going to Dr. Bunkis for facelifts! I am planning to have a tummy tuck with Dr. Bunkis as soon as possible. I also get Botox from Dr. Bunkis which leaves me looking like the best version of myself!

When I say that Dr. Bunkis is caring it is because he listened to my emotional situation that was going on with an insurance/medical entity that refused to remove 4 suspicious and irritating moles. The outside insurance entity that my employer recently switched to would not accept outside pathology (pathology that showed a pre cancer mole situation), only shaved a portion of one of the 4 noted suspicious moles and left the root of the moles in. These moles worried me so much as a single and sole providing mother of a 10 year old boy. The mole that the outside medical provider shaved became irritated, itched, became hard and redness was around the area for weeks. Being that my mother worked in a hospital for 30 years and my aunt was a surgical nurse, I had knowledge of cancer conditions because moles were not removed properly or entirely. I called Dr. Bunkis's office and emotionally relayed my worries over the moles. I did not know that Dr. Bunkis performed this surgery but was greatly relieved when I was told that he did and that he would help me!

Dr. Bunkis removed 4 suspicious moles to the root and had them sent to pathology. The surgery was painless, the healing was a breeze and there were NO complications of any sort! My 10 year old son and I thank Dr. Bunkis and his caring staff with all of our hearts. I have to mention his caring staff as well.. They listened kindly to my emotional story and treated me like they would family! Thank you so much Dr. Bunkis and Staff!!</review>< Response>

<Text>I consulted with Dr. Bunkis for Botox and Voluma. I found him to be very informative and extremely knowledgeable. He answered all of my questions and was very gentle. I am extremely pleased with the results. While I was there for my appointment I had questions about tightening up my neck and jowels and I am happy to say that I'm on the books to get a facelift in the fall. I will keep you posted of my results. He was referred to me and I would definitely refer him to anyone looking for an honest and listening doctor. Also, his staff, Tina, Colette and Tracy are the friendliest people and make you feel very at home and comfortable. 5 stars all around.</Text>< Resp>

I went in for a IPL that I purchased on Groupon. I wanted to get rid of some redness and discoloration on my cheeks and forehead. After 2 treatments with Dr. Bunkis, I am really pleased with the results. I would recommend purchasing the numbing cream as it makes it a more comfortable procedure. I really find Dr. Bunkis to be attentive and felt he listened to my concerns.< /review>

<Time>1454992444661<//Time><Rate>5< /Rate><text>I had my initial consultation at Orange County Plastic Surgery today where I was met by a very friendly receptionist.  I was immediately taken back to an operatory where I met Dr. Bunkis.  I had a list of questions and concerns about the surgery/procedures I was contemplating.  Dr. Bunkis not only answered all my questions regarding my surgery but also made me feeling very comfortable in making my final decision.  I am planning on having a breast augmentation (smaller implants put in), breast lift, and a face lift.  Dr. Bunkis explained the entire process, from start to finish, so there would be no guessing on my part as to what to expect pre-op and post op.  I feel great about my decision to have Dr. Bunkis perform my surgery as I know I am in the best care possible.  I went to 2 other plastic surgeons, for their opinion, and at the end of the day, Dr. Bunkis was hands down the best!  He has the experience, the credentials, patient testimonials, before and after pictures, and is highly respected in his field.  I will post after my surgery.

<text>I have known Dr. Bunkis since 1998.  He has performed a facelift, lipo and rhinoplasty on me over the years.   I trust him wholeheartedly!  But the procedure that I am most pleased with is the reconstructive surgery Dr. Bunkis did on my nose.  I had skin cancer on my nose that my HMO just kept burning off.  They neglected to do MOHS.  Dr. Bunkis took charge and sent me to a MOHS Surgeon.  Dr. Bunkis then did the reconstructive surgery to repair the huge whole in my nose.  If it wasn't for him,  the cancer would have kept spreading.  He is a very caring and compassionate Doctor.  I would highly recommend him!< /text>< Pictures>

<review>I have been a patient of Dr. Pearl’s office inside Costco Lakewood for as long as I’ve known. I always look forward to getting my annual eye exam because they’re quick, accurate, helpful and accepts my insurance. Small office but well equipped with all the machines needed to conduct a comprehensive eye exam and a sink conveniently located in the lobby for hand washing too. Booking an appointment is so easy they accept new patients as long as they’re Costco members.<//review>< pics>

<Review>Dr Jemini Patel is phenomenal, she is extremely professional and explains everything in detail in regards to any eye concerns. In my case, I had very high eye pressure and she prescribed some drops and went back the next day and eye pressure went down and she dilated my eyes and took the comprehensive eye pictures. She explains everything in my case in detail. She genuinely cared about me and my eyes and it is very rare in these days. She really went above and beyond in taking care of my concerns with my eyes. Dr Pearl is great too but I would definitely with no reservations  recommend Dr Patel. Thank you Dr Patel 🙏🏽<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Dr. Patel was thorough, and took her time to find the best measurement for my vision. She answered all my questions and shared with me new products that were very useful for me. Their receptionist were helpful and understanding in changing my appointment to fit my schedule. Excellent overall!</review>

Dr. Pearl is a great doctor very professional with a lot of experience.
I highly recommend him.
He spends time with patients listen to them. They're constantly cleaning everything, disinfecting all equipment.
I feel very comfortable waking in the office they take one patient inside a the time.
Please do not make appointment with anyone else but with Dr. Pearl.< /Text>< Pics>

<Name>Kim Reynolds< /Name><text>We've been using Pearl Optometry inside Costco for years now, and every one of the optometrists has been friendly and professional, willing to answer any questions and giving useful advice, with no high pressure sales pitch. Our insurance pays most of the bill for each visit, but we'd come here even if we had no insurance, considering the very reasonable exam charges.</text></record></dataset><record>

They saw me quickly, with an appointment, they kept sanitizing after every touch. And walked me through all the steps easily. They went over my eye exam thoroughly and efficiently. I left with new prescriptions for glasses and contacts. And my doctor sent me home with a couple sets of contacts to try out after complaining about dry eyes. Can't wait to go back to Costco and check out their frames. I tried a few but I need more time lol.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80dd32f3f667e57d:0x618e73a23bb3f0c1</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The worst experience. I would give zero stars if I could.
First the assistant told my daughter that it was illegal for her to be driving without her glasses. RUDE! Last I read, they were an optometry center, not the police.
Then they dilated my daughters eyes with out explaining to her what the drops were for. It wasn’t till afterwards did they let her know she could not drive for 5 hours! Do they know that customers do drive themselves to their appointments???
Also, she has never needed drop before. However, it adds to their cost so I’m not surprised.
The exam was very short and limited, nothing compared to our usual optometry exams.
Lastly, we had to wait in line to ask a simple question, whether they could place new lenses in her current glasses. We were rudely ignored and long story short, received the WORST customer service by their very own manager, MARILYN. She was rude when we asked for help, gave a Costco employee attitude when he asked her if she could help us, she allowed a line of over 12 people to wait while she continued to clean classes, put them on display and clean up. No acknowledgement from her except to remind us to social distance, which at this point we could no longer do bc a line had built up from waiting a very long time. We were there for an hour and half and charged almost double than what my daughter could afford since she is on unemployment and does not have vision insurance.
MARILYN needs to reevaluate her position if she can’t step up in supporting her staff and give the best customer service by being hands on with the customers, not the glasses!
Everyone has a boss, so I will be looking into who I need to speak to about this experience.
They represent Costco even though they are separate from them. Costco provides the best customer service and a company like that should not be allowed to operate in their warehouses.</review>

Dr. Pearl is a great listener and very friendly.  He spends time with you and listens to your concerns.  Please do not make appointment with anyone else but with Dr. Pearl.  You will not be dissapointed. I highly recommend him.<//text>

< review>
My wife and I had a great experience at the Costco location a little over a year ago.  We are scheduling our annual checkup for this weekend.

We found the staff to be friendly and efficient.  We were seen by Dr. Pearl himself and he completed our exam.  We didn't expect full service at Costco, but he not only took care of the prescription testing but also the glaucoma pressure test, blood vessel imaging, and even dilated my eyes to examine the nerve due to my diabetes.

We were both surprised to find an optometrist there as we only thought they had an optical department.  I highly recommend them.<//review>

Pearl Vision inside the Costco in Lakewood Center Mall, is where I had my eye exam. I paid $59 for the exam which included photos of the eyes and a short exam with a provider. (I'm retired with no vision insurance) When exam was finished, the provider asked if I wanted to know the condition of my eyes for additional fee of $20. Photos had already been taken as part of the exam, but if I wanted the results, I needed to pay an additional $20. What? They take photos of the patient's eyes; do the exam with a provider who will only give you the results if you pay more! What a scam!< /review>

<text>I was put on hold by the receptionist, Crystal, for 10 minutes, hung up on, put on on hold for an additional 30 minutes, and hung up on again! Getting hung up on aside, I was put on hold for a total of 40 minutes just to change my appt date. That is completely unacceptable.</text>< pictures>

Went there doc was totally rude and told me I'd be blind in my right eye within the year and was very cold when she told me. Got a second opinion found out they were just giving me the wrong prescription. This was back in 2013.</text>

Great little spot. They have a regular menu with what you’d expect. Also have a cafeteria style plate option with entree and sides. Food is quality and feels home made. Good little spot<//Review>

<Review>The restaurant is very nicely decorated. The bar area has a very inviting feel to it. The staff is very professional and the overall restaurant looked very clean. Good place for a date.
3- stars only because of the amount of time it takes to get your food. I got 3 coffee refils before i got my food.. almost 45 min after we ordered.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKJ2Aqn0yyEZETqHLAM-1BgpYUsmuTGj-kVAwZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-Jp5ZsIfxAxU325bhME_2IiYJzPzeul65p8Q0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdrbuD01wB_fakX7cTxIfHnp3akkOHiVI0xWrM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< resp>

< Review>
I've been to this location twice. The first time I came in, I ordered the El Torito Burrito and I was not impressed. The little meat it did have, was hard and flavorless. The pico de gallo was basically just onions, and the guacamole was barely visible. Five months later I came in for another go and I'm glad I did. I ordered the La Torta Cochinita and it was amazing. Very flavorful! The order came with a side of fries which were mediocre, but, honestly the torta was very filling I could have gone without them. The agua frescas are pretty tasty too! And customer service is friendly.< /Review>

ACTUAL "MEXICAN" FOOD, NOT TACO BELL MEXICAN FOOD. I ALWAYS COME HERE FOR MY LUNCH BREAK, AND EVERY WEEKDAY THE LUNCH IS DIFFERENT, AND IF I DON'T LIKE THE LUNCH THEIR MENU STILL HAS GREAT ENTREES. IF YOU WANT A TASTE OF THE REAL DEAL WITHOUT CROSSING THE BORDER, THIS IS ONE OF THOSE PLACES THAT NAILS IT.< /Text>

<Text>I was craving a Carne Asada Plate, but today it isnt on the menu, Unfortunately. Tried the barbacoa and it gets a 2 stars out of 5. The garden salad was great. Restuarant was clean, sevice was fast and reasonable prices. Very nice mix of spanish and english music. Not to shabby. Give it an overall 3 stars.<//Text>< pictures>

<review>Food was very good. Turkey/Avacado sandwich. I enjoy outside dining and today was a perfect day for it. Our waitress was very nice and great at her job. Wasnt the hovering or disappearing type. Would for sure go there again.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Review>Excellent! I love everything I've had here so far, from bread, soups and salads, to appetizers, entrees and desserts. Nice wine list, too! A quiet, low key corner location - wish they had an outdoor patio, but I'm just happy they are in my neighborhood.<//Review>< pics>

<review>I’m in shock by all these great reviews.   All 6 of us had lunch and the food looked like it was prepared by someone who never worked a line at a restaurant before.   I’ve been in the food business for many decades and this is a very sad attempt on how to serve food.<//review><gmapID>0x80dd4832b2ffb9d9:0x4e8d4697e669b737<//gmapID>< Resp>

Sonny's is located in another strip mall on 25th street, just east of Western Avenue.  I gave it 4 stars, although if I could have I would have rated it 3 1/2 stars.  Some of the dishes are very good and some of them need some help.  I would rate the food as nicely prepared comfort food.  The decor is OK.  The service is excellent.  If you can, get Barbara as your server.  She's a sweetheart.< /Review>

Came with my dad. It was alright. I'm vegetarian and there was only one dish i could order and still needed to modify. Pasta something. Obviously it wasn't amazing or I would have remembered. 3 stars is generous.<//review>

The food here is amazing! I'm going back for the beef stroganoff. My wife got the filet mignon which was 2 inches high and cooked perfectly.

The atmosphere is definitely of the senior crowd but they're there definitely for the good food and the lady singing by the bar. But don't let that stop you from going and checking out this gem.< /review>

<time>1535659504897<//time><Rating>4< /Rating><text>(Translated by Google) Lunch: They were able to remove the celery from the salad, but not from the crab cake. So I decided on the Seared Ahi Tuna Salad with an Asian dressing with wonton pieces. The salad was very good, the tuna was also good but a little too cold inside. The Rustic Apple Tart - huge and decorated with a ball of caramel ice cream - tasted very good. The dough was unfortunately a bit soggy. Maybe it has to be like that, I can't judge that. The coffee (americano) was excellent.

Lunch: Den Salat konnten sie vom Sellerie befreien, den Crab Cake aber nicht. Also entschied ich mich für den Seared Ahi Tuna Salad an einem asiatischen Dressing mit Wonton Stückchen. Der Salat war sehr gut, der Tuna war ebenfalls gut aber innen etwas zu kalt.   Die Rustic Apple Tart - riesig und mit einer kugel Caramelglacé dekoriert - war geschmacklich sehr gut. Der Teig war leider etwas pampig. Eventuell muss das so sein, das kann ich nicht beurteilen. Der Kaffee (Americano) war hervorragend.</text>< pictures>

Because this is a treat for me, it gets all 4 of the stars. They are always hot and tasty. The staff is quick and friendly when you get your treats. The line moves so fast you don't have time to get angry.

The best thing to do is park in the Nordstrom's garage near sears on the third level. This will put you right where you need to be for Cinnabon.<//review>

< Review>
So I go here because I am craving an unhealthy but delicious cinnabon and to my surprise, there stands a ratchet female with uncombed hair standing next to her co-worker, with whom was making cinnabons, and the girl is eating lunch and drinking right next to the baker. This is a huge no no in the dept of health! Oh my gosh the contamination!</Review>

<review>The young staff is so rude and slow! Bread was hard even after they microwave it! I had to ask for a Refund because they took to long doing the my Oreo latte, and the manager had the nerve to give me attitude about it and said it will take 3 days to get a refund but I would rather wait those three days then wait another minute for my drink, they had three staff members no excuse why they delayed my drink. Just bad all around.< /review><gmap_id>0x809ada1e99fe3ba5:0xeb95675772d33481</gmap_id></record>

I scheduled Junk King to come pick up a sleeper sofa and TV stand. They were great, arrived as scheduled and very quickly took care of the job. Very affordable.<//text>

<review>Update 1/5/2020.
Updating my rating from 1 to 4 stars.  Luis called me this morning to apologize regarding the service and the miscommunication.  Junk King discounted my service fee for my inconvenience.  Luis gave me his personal number and told me if ever i needed service in the future to call him directly and he would take care of me.  Thanks Luis.

I just got finishing building a deck when a member of our family went to the hospital. Thus I didn’t have time to deal with clean up.  I called Junk King and told them I just finished building a deck and had wood left over and other general junk I wanted cleaned up.  They showed up gave me a quote after I showed them everything I wanted cleaned up.   Then they removed all the general garbage. After all that was loaded in their truck they told me they could not take pressure treated wood.  They should have told me that from the beginning. I would have called 1800-GOT-JUNK as they  would take it.   Basically they took all the stuff I could have called the city to pick up for free and charged me $340.00 and I still have all the left over wood.  Not only that when they sorted all the wood they moved the pressure treated wood right in front of a gate so I had to move it.   They left the place a mess.  I called Junk King to complain and the dispatcher agreed that they should have let me know prior to booking and the workers should have let me know before loading. He asked that they pick it up. They agreed to it. I thought we were done. Then a few minutes later they told me their boss called and told them they could not pick it up.  They tried to take off and still had not finished picking up the regular stuff.  I called dispatch back and the person said he would have the main guy I originally talked to call me back. I waited.... waited.... they never called me back.  Very unprofessional.  Moral of the story don’t use Junk King use 1800GOTJUNK.   I have used both services now. 1800GOTJUNK picked everything up and swept up and left the place clean. Junk King didn’t pick everything up and didn’t properly communicate to give me a choice of not using them and then not only did they not sweep but they moved stuff in my way.  I will update this review if Junk King contacts me to make this right.</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNw5yeZp4GVGPSwludhTvzdvUVC7YlrCubb1A-E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWosUanYXQ2wzRYgK8v_exY7odil9bB7496QRQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMV_4kE1vyfiavH2nGlqZD6QKSFBkZrKW1siCUb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

The crew showed up at the end of the day and worked quickly and efficiently to clean up the area that I requested.
The crew was polite and happy to do their job even after a long day. I highly recommend Junk King and I will certainly use them again.

As a professional property management group, we have use Junk-King as our vendor of choice when tenants need a recommendation for a hauler upon move-outs. Junk King has been the most professional hauling company when it comes to pickups and updates for arrivals. Pricing is fair and reasonable. I recommend all property management needs.</Text>

I started with estimating in their website by adding the type of items that I wanna get rid of. I was able to list down all my items in the text box they provided wile booking. Then, got an estimate online. Was able to book a slot for appointment. One day before, they sent me a reminder text. Then, 15 minutes before arrival they called me and assured me that they are on the way. On arrival, they took a look at the items and they exactly charged what the website showed as an estimate. In total, my items were little over their quarter truck size, so they charged me for the difference, but that wasn't a largely different from the estimate. They provided me 20 bucks discount for booking online. They take their items only after you agree in person on day of haul. I was able to securely pay online after the haul when they sent an invoice over email. So, I highly recommend to use their website to book online and also mention all the items you want to get rid of while submitting the booking. Overall, these guys are the best. I would recommend for anyone and would try next time I want to get any junk hauled.</review>< Pics>

<text>Damion, Jesse and Andrew came out and were so helpful and efficient! They came out evaluated what I needed to have done, gave me a very fair estimate, and took what I needed away! It only took them like 30 minutes to load two truck loads. They were such nice young men too! I am so happy with the service and the price! I would 100% recommend using them!!</text>< pictures>

I appreciated the phone calls that were for minor rescheduling as well as the rescheduled for a few days later.  The latter was due to the holiday.  No problem for me since I do not have many other obligations.

It was unfortunate that the lead person on the rescheduled was different from the first one.  Since he was different, some of the things that I had pointed out were not removed.  Even a few of the other things I mentioned on the actual day were left.  I must admit I was a bit tired and did not mention them again.

Everyone was polite and masked.< /review>

My hot tub and gazebo hasn't been used in 9 years and I've wanted it out of my yard for at least 5 years. I just never knew what kind of service provider does that and I didn't know how anyone could get it out of my yard and thru the gate and fence.

They came over and gave me an estimate and it was absolutely worth the money to clean up my yard of this hot tub so I can use the the space better.

They were professional and took care to be COVID compliant. They got it done in about an hour. Smooth and easy.

Definitely recommend.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<review>Positives.  Friendly.  Removed what was asked.  Did not make a mess.  Efficient.

Not so goods.  Did not call in advance to notify when they would arrive as I was informed.  Quoted much higher price than estimate from phone call.  Had to negotiate a better price, but still far from initial quote.  My estimated quantity was accurate, so it should have been close to the initial quote to be fair.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

When I called we needed someone to come same day, and they initially said they were booked all day in our zip code. They were very responsive to call back and say they had a cancellation and came 3 hours ahead of schedule, and were able to pickup 2 and a half loads and finish the job within about 3 hours. The crew of 2 was professional and quick, polite and flexible. Thank you very much!!<//Text>

When they finally showed up, the work was first rate and priced fairly. They were almost 4 hours late (beyond their 2-hour window). There was sympathy from the receptionist but no compensation from the company. I re-scheduled. They arrived on time the second time and did a fantastic job. Took care not to damage anything and cleaned up well. Nice fellows. They work their tails off; I hope they are well paid.<//text>

<review>The process was very easy to set up and get an appointment. The employees that came to pick up called ahead to give me their ETA and were on time. They even waited for me as I was running late. They also let me add additional items that I didn't realize were left behind at my old home and even suggested they take some of the garbage out of my trash bin for me as it was overflowed. TOP CLASS service prompted me to leave this survey when I normally don't take the time to do so.</review>< pics>

<Review>The team was not only prompt, but gave me a call when they were about 25 minutes away. I have a tough address to get to, and they were among the precious few who immediately understood my directions and arrived without issue. I way overestimated the size of my haul, and they reduced the estimate accordingly (I thought it would take a whole truck - turned out it was only 1/8 of a truck!). Very fast pickup, friendly and professsional. They were cognizant of what I was throwing out, and alerted me to a few tools that they thought I might want to keep. They were right! Will absolutely call Junk King for all hauling needs!< /Review><Name>Ann Jasper<//Name>< pics>

Junk King came to our rescue when we bought our first home and started our remodel! We had so much construction waste that it took over our entire deck. I was amazed at the efficiency of the two men who came to collect everything, they worked hard and fast and got my deck cleaned off in record time. They went out of their way to schedule us so we could have other work done in a timely manner. I will not hesitate to use them and refer them to others in the future! Thank you Junk King!!< /text>

I requested a quote after business hours expecting to get a response the following business day. I not only got a response an hour after my request I completed the quote and made an appointment within an hour time. When the gentleman showed up today to remove my items they were professional and only touched items that they were removing. Highly recommend.< /Review>

We have used Junk King twice. They're awesome! Easy to book. Super nice guys that are professional, fast, and reliable. Very reasonable estimates and honest pricing. Me and my family will definitely be calling the Junk King for any junk we need removed.

3 gentlemen arrived on time with tools and an empty truck. They were hard working courteous and accommodating. They tackled every single ugly aspect of the job with great attitude. They transformed a filthy trash heap into a clean yard. I can now look out there and see the beauty that was beneath. I think their charges were fair and I highly recommend them.<//Text>

The pile kept growing larger and larger, but the Junk King’s showed up and hauled it all away quickly and professionally for what I deemed a fair price for the work involved. They did arrive outside of the scheduled window, but were communicative about it, so no harm done. Thank you! I know who to call when I work up the nerve to tackle the garage 😉.<//text>< name>

I needed a hot water heater removed and properly disposed of. Junk King San Jose was prompt with their response to my initial message on Yelp. They immediately quoted a very competitive price that included a surprising $20 discount. A reschedule from my initial appointment was needed due to an understandable staffing issue however it was all communicated quickly and professionally. On the day of the removal from my rental property I was texted a picture of the water heater and then received a confirmation phone call. Top notch service and polite employees. All around a great experience. I highly recommend them.<//review>

Good pricing, nice employees.  Under bid the job and stood by the quote.  Only negative was they started a job Monday but didnt return to finish the job until the end of the week.  They did however keep me informed through the process and I agreed to the schedule changes when they requested the flexibility.< /text>

Issue is the prices. For a small couch with roll up bedding was $148.00! They were on my doorstep only reason I said yes. Smart move by Junk King. I was expecting $80 which is still super high but wanted a professional company during these times. All the other small garbage hauling businesses were charging me $50.< /review>< Pics>

I needed to get rid of a queen sized mattress. I put it in a cover, took a picture, asked for a quote and got a response back from them quickly online with a written estimate. We also called Got Junk: they quoted us double on the phone and refused to give a written estimate. Anyway we went with Junk King. The guys who showed up were great. They had their masks on. Two of them tossed the mattress in and told me they’d bill me online. The third guy never shut the engine off. The whole thing took less than 3 minutes.</text>

It was great. Showed up at the designated time. Removed my item. Emailed my statement so we could maintain a social distance. Junk king gets an "atta boy"
From me.
Thank you

They did the job very quickly I thought the prices were a little high for just removing junk but they're all about the same so it doesn't matter which company I went to< /Review>

<review>Junk King rocks! They responded quickly, gave us a great quote, and picked up everything quickly (and we had a lot of stuff) from old very heavy woodshop equipment, furniture, bags of junk and yard debris - all gone in around 30 minutes. All three gents were very friendly and professional. I highly recommend Junk King!</review>< Pics>

<text>Always a pleasure to work with the guys at Junk King. They arrive on time after giving a pre arrival call. They are quick and remove whatever you desire to be removed. Everything from household junk to furniture and even appliances. Their quote online was dead on and very reasonable. I use Junk King for work as well as personal junk removal needs. Highly recommend!<//text>< gmap_id>

<text>Kevin and Luis took really good care of my mother in law. She had some junk piling up. My mother in law has high standards in terms of customer service and she gave Luis rave reviews as extremely professional and courteous. While there was some initial confusion about the appointment schedule, Luis and Kevin took care of business and made everything right, right away. I will definitely use Junk King again; it’s a local business with high touch service and good people.< /text>< Time>

Excellent company.  Prices could not be more fair.  I went to their competitor first.  The well known one that spends all their money on TV ads.  They wanted to charge me three times what Junk King charged.  Junk King is the best.  Cant recommend them enough!!</Review>

The junk king crew came when they said, were reasonably priced and took my junk away immediately. Exactly what I was looking for. They even took the time to sweep up and make sure the whole area was presentable when they left.</review>

<review>I had a lot of junk I wanted to get out of my garage for a while now. So I made an appointment online for junk Kings to come give me an estimate. Made an appointment for 12:00 to 2:00 on Friday, they called that morning and asked if they can come early, and they were here by 11:00. I should them what I wanted to get rid of they gave me an estimate, I agreed and it took them 20mins to get everything loaded and taken away. It was easy, quick and they three guys that came were friendly, efficient and professional. I would use them again.<//review><time>1588372091526</time>< pictures>

This is my third time using Junk King and I’m happy every time they come by. They make the process easy. They come when they say they will. The price is reasonable. They worked out touchless pick up during covid, it’s great. They are my go-to junk guys. Thank you guys!< /Review>

<text>Wonderful service done by two super young men. Fast. Efficient.
Surprising clean up after completing the load.  I am very very pleased
with the service and the reasonable cost.  I will and do recommend
JUNK KING to everyone.  I won't use anyone else for my future clean up needs.

Great experience.  Scheduling online was easy.  Guys showed up on time for estimate, explained bid well.  Received bid by email 20 min later.   Their bid was $300 less than another big name junk removal service.  Job was scheduled in a timely manner and 800 number answered calls quickly  and was great.  No complaints and I'm a picky gal.< /Review>

<Review>Team showed up within the specified window, even though they had called to say they were running a bit behind. Very fair price to haul away a large amount of old household items including a small sofa, ottoman, ping pong table and old nordictrack. Two gentlemen worked very hard to load our stuff into an already full truck. Very professional and swept up all remnants once they were done. Will definitely use them again!< /Review>< Name>

We cleared out over ten years’ worth of junk from our house and thanks to Junk King, it was gone in less than 20 minutes. I texted to see about getting an estimate and set up an appointment for the following day. I was told someone would call me about 20 minutes before arrival, and to my surprise, they actually called and confirmed that they were on their way. When the two gentlemen arrived, they gave a very fair and reasonably priced estimate, and I agreed. They were able to take the junk right then and could not have been nicer or more professional. Highly recommend, and if junk piles up again, we know who to call!<//review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>They called 15 minutes before coming as promised, assessed the amount of junk we had and gave us a quote. Then they came the next day to haul everything away including a leather sofa, mattresses, other furniture and stuff we had in our back yard and side yard. They worked very efficiently and were accommodating enough to take mattress and box spring we had in boxes in the garage and switch them for ones on a bed, then haul away the old ones. I had contacted several other places that didn't even bother to call me back. I definitely will use Junk King again if I need that kind of service.</review><response>None</response><username>Stephanie Pressman<//username>< time>

Excellent all around: This company was the first to respond to my request for quote. Then it got better from here. They came very quickly to look at the job and provided the lowest quote among about 4 that I got. They also provide what seems a rare service of hauling dirt.

The quote system is professionally done in writing via email. I made the mistake of asking for a total price that's higher than the quote and it got corrected to the right amount. The truck and serviceman came right on scheduled time (calling ahead as well). The work was done exactly as desired.

I would recommend Junk King 110% and I can see why they get 5 stars overall!! Well done!< /Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>I had Junk King do a large cleanup for me at work a few years ago. They were fantastic! When I finally got the motivation to do my own cleanup at home, I thought of the great service and respectful handling of the job done at my work, so of course I called them again. No surprise today, they came early, gave a fair estimate, and cleaned up after they were done! It made me feel reassured noticeing that the person in charge was also one of the crew from from the job a few years back and he remembered the job they did back then.  Truly a great experiance!</text>< Pics>

<text>100% recommendation. Antonio and Billy arrived within the allotted time, called ahead of their arrival to let me know they were on their way. They were efficient, friendly, professional. They also had the unexpected complication of maneuvering the 5 appliances and water heater down the driveway, across the front porch to get around the construction van blocking the driveway. Both gentleman took it in stride and were done in no time.

This is the fourth time I have called on Junk King this year ... would absolutely do so again.<//text>< GmapID>

Two workers arrived within the allocated time-frame to remove a window cornice. I was under the impression that all they had to do was pull the cornice off two supportive brackets, but both workers had to unscrew the cornice from three brackets. They spent an additional 15 minutes at no charge to me. Wonderful customer service!<//Text>

<user_name>Elizabeth Geurts<//user_name><Review>Junk hauling was much more expensive than I expected. $230 for not that much junk (they equated it to the volume of a pick-up truck). Maybe all haulers charge this much, but I was shocked. They also showed up an hour beyond my two hour window. They did call ahead of time, though, to say they would be late. The two gentlemen were polite and worked quickly.<//Review>< Response>

< Review>
I called on Thursday at 4pm and they gave me an appointment window for Friday from 1-3pm. At 1pm, they called me to let me know they were 20 minutes away. So far so good. Within minutes of me accepting their fair price to haul everything away, they had it all loaded and told me that I would receive an invoice by email that I could pay by credit card. Excellent! By the time I went into the house, there was the email and it took less than a minute to pay. It does not get better than this! I could not be happier with my experience. The three gentlemen that did the work were polite and friendly as well. This was Grade A service.</Review>

The Junk King guys were fantastic! They were courteous, friendly and informative! They came by and gave me a great quote and ended up not needing to use the whole truck so they charged me less! I would absolutely recommend these guys, after they were done they swept up and made sure everything they were doing was okay by me. Great work Junk Kings, you guys deserve your crown!<//text>

They came a little late but it felt good that everything was gone. Left everything clean. Had me check that everything I wanted to be taken was gone. Was polite and made sure they weren’t  taking anything they weren’t supposed to. I had a good experience!!</text>

<review>The people who came were friendly, and diligent. They took everything, and cleaned up after. My only complaint is that their first driver didn't arrive for work, and no one informed me. So I waited for an 8-10 am time slot to no avail. Calling customer service didn't help, until my 3rd try, when they connected me to the owner. He helped direct a new truck to my place, and everything worked out in the end.

Apparently the customer service department is structured to set up appointments, but they have no ability to resolve issues like this.

Still, I found no one who was rude, and the problems were resolved. I have a cleaner place, and someone else is dealing with 15 cu yards of debris.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Attentive service by owner Kevin, professional and friendly service by all, discount, local, recommended, flexible, paying by a cool, timesaving system that scans your credit card and saves your info, business model obviously stresses customer satisfaction, quick service, possibly best of all, will take partial truckloads. No one needed to be at home when the work was done - I had a hunch there would be no problems.  It would be silly to go anywhere else.< /Text>

<Review>Great service. Texted with them to arrange an estimate. Showed up on time as promised. Exceptionally polite, friendly guys, gave a fair price to haul the stuff on the spot. We were done in a few minutes as if the junk was never there. I highly recommend, and will take my own recommendation next time I need to haul away junk. These guys are great.<//Review>< GmapID>

<text>The team was nice and courteous.  I thought the cost was pretty high though.  It was $350 for what took 5 minutes to load in the truck since I had bagged all the loose junk.  They charge by volume so it is what it is I guess.  I could have turned them away after getting the quote but I bit the bullet since I wanted the pile gone.  Moving forward i’ll only use it I have really heavy and scattered items.</text>< Pictures>

Three guys came and they were so nice they gave me a really good deal and I am very appreciated for people like that that help homeowners out especially single moms that don’t have any resource to remove heavy stuff I definitely recommend this company.</Review>

<text>Will definitely call back with more business. Very nice person on the phone scheduled my free estimate. Driver called 15 minutes prior. When they arrived we showed them what needed to be taken and got our estimate. I feel it was fair and they loaded everything right then and there.  Very polite and patient with my mother who uses a walker.< /text>< gmapID>

They called ahead of arriving and were friendly and efficient when here.  The estimate was more than fair and they worked so quickly.  I would definitely recommend Junk King and use them again.  Thank you!</Text>

Very professional crew! The guys were on time and moved our 50” rear projector TV quickly, and for the same extremely reasonable price, that they had quoted me over the phone! Another well known business quoted me an astronomical price of $200+ to haul away the same item. Great job!!!< /review>

<review>The men arrived during the window time given & quickly removed the very large Cal king foam mattress.
The office staff setting up the appt. was very courteous & gave me an excellent price!
I had already compared prices with several other companies so I knew I had an excellent price quoted to me.
Next time I will definately use them if I need junk removed.

First of all, JK got the job because of prompt replies and excellent communication with the people out in the field. We were given a same day window for the junk pickup. We were given a 15 minute heads up before arrival. The haulers were polite and we were surprised and pleased how efficiently they worked to get our junk on the truck. I paid them, they covered the junk to prevent anything from flying out, they drove off, and our junk was gone. Just like that!< /text>< Pics>

This was our second time working with Junk King. We had an appointment window scheduled from 10a to noon. Unfortunately all the trucks/guys were on big jobs and could not make it to our house until around 2:30p. Luckily I had the day off from work, so the delay didn't matter too much to me. When the guys (Luis and Joseph) did arrive they were both very professional, personable, and apologized for being late. Luis gave me a quote after seeing all the things we wanted to get rid of and once I agreed he and Joseph made quick work of loading our junk into their truck. We will definitely call on Junk King the next time we need to get rid of stuff.<//text>

Great service and value.  I'd requested service via the Junk King web site and it was scheduled in my first available time slot.  The Junk King employees who showed up were very friendly and efficient.  We had about 2/3 of a truck worth of various items - old outdoor kids play furniture, an old outdoor heat lamp, packing boxes from our garage, old rugs, leftover sand from a sand box, etc.   They loaded everything up in 45 minutes.  Highly recommended!<//Review>

<review>Awesome service. I called to get a price quote for a couch we wanted to get rid of. The quote I was given was $110 which was MUCH lower than anyone else had offered. I let the woman I spoke to know that I needed to run things by my wife before I could say yes. When I called back to schedule the pick up I was told they would do the pick up for $75 instead of $110! Service pick up was quick and the movers were very knowledgeable. Thank you Junk King!</review><Resp>None</Resp>< name>

I appreciated the flexibility of your service to reduce pick up cost, of my mattress. Also much appreciated the email confirmation, as well as the phone call prior to pickup. Your follow up and follow through are to be commended. I would certainly use your services again, and highly recommend your company to others. AG in San Jose<//review>

<Text>They were on time within the appointment window, and called before they arrived to give an eta on how far they were out. The gentlemen who arrived were courteous and just a pleasure to work with. They were super quick in picking up our junk, and before I knew it, they were done! I would definitely use their services again.< /Text><time>1529253216347<//time>< Gmap_id>

The pick up was easy to set up. I was given a time range for the next day. I got a call when the team was about 15 minutes away.They were courteous, fast, and willing to carry a sofa downstairs.  Payment was easy since it was done online.< /Text>

Last week I loaded up my tiny Ford Ranger pick-up and went to the dump. The complete trip took just over two hours. The dump fees were $53.44. I was tired of going to dump and was desperately seeking an alternative. With Junk King, now I have a great alternative to doing this myself. These guys called in the morning to let me know when they would arrive. They arrived on time, were clean cut, and pleasant. They smiled, introduced themselves, and shook my hand. Before starting the project, they made sure to fully understand my needs, offered me a price, and wrote it down. I filled up a quarter of their truck and it took them only about 15 minutes to load everything up from the pile out front of the house. They swept up the driveway and then asked me if there was anything else they could do. I like these guys and will use them again.< /text>

We picked Junk King because of the great reviews and now we want to give them a great review! They have excellent service from the moment we requested a quote and until they removed our junk! The job we had for them was not an easy task and we will definitely use them again!</Review>

<username>Andrew Pence< /username><time>1555437434122</time><rate>5<//rate><review>I called Junk King last night to inquire about a possible haul after a bathroom remodel. The representative was very personable, but still professional. She informed me that the truck would arrive the next day between 8-10 AM. I received a call at 8:22 AM that the crew was 15-20 mins away. The lead provided me a quote and began the removal. I had to leave before they finished, so the lead offered to send me pictures once the job was completed. He stuck to his word. I would recommend Junk King to anyone. Very professional, flexible, honest, and hard working.< /review>< Pics>

<review>This is the second time I have scheduled trash pickup with Junk Kings - they are very courteous and professional. What took me two days to pull up was gone, cleaned and swept up in less than 30 minutes. They can’t be beat. I also appreciated the pre-arrival call. They came early in the timeframe allotted so I could get on with my day.

I will call them again as I continue to purge spaces in my home!<//review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

I needed a big screen tv and stand hauled from my family room.  The entire transaction was arranged via texts and finalized in a email...all in less than 1/2  hour.   Later that same day the crew arrived to haul it away.  They were polite and quickly completed the job.  Overall an excellent experience.  I would definitely use this company again!< /Review>

Your crew called me 20 minutes before they arrived & were at my house in 22 minutes (which is amazing!), and in exactly 15 minutes, everything was taken care of (process explanation, junk load-up, payment and emailed receipt)! Plus your services were almost $200 less than the GOT-JUNK guys, and you hauled away more stuff! I will recommend you to everyone I know for your services, and look forward to using you again soon.< /Review>

Later that same day the crew arrived to haul it away.  They were polite and quickly completed the job.  Overall an excellent experience.  I would definitely use this company again!<//review>

I understand that things happen and sometimes schedules don't work out; keeping me in the loop about the changing schedule made the situation OK. When the truck arrived, the driver and his coworker explained the payment methods and removed my junk quickly.

You guys were very conscientious about making sure you didn't grab the wrong stuff. You showed up when you said you would, both for the estimate and the removal, and were pleasant guys who worked efficiently.< /Review>

<review>To describe my experience in one word - WOW! My husband had contacted several companies to try and get the pile of soil removed from our driveway. Nobody was willing to even quote the project. I took over and contacted Junk King by texting a picture of the pile. I received a response immediately and was able to schedule an appointment for a free quote that day! Junk King would have taken the pile that same day too if it hadn’t poured rain (causing the dirt to be too heavy for removal). We rescheduled for a couple days later (recommended by Junk King due to the weather). I cannot day enough how happy I am with my experience with Junk King. Would absolutely use their service again! Thank you Junk King!!< /review>< user>

<Text>1. Every time I called, they answered the phone on the first ring.
2. They were able to accommodate my time window for the next day.
3. They were there when they said they would be there.
4. The price was VERY reasonable.
5. The guys that did the work were very personable and professional.
Bottom line, they did what they said they would at a very fair price.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

We had a house that was packed full of 20 years worth of furniture, clothing, and clutter. I met Shane Lopez and David Torres who were very professional. They came and removed all the trash and helped sweep and clean the rooms. I'm Very happy with the service provided. It also helps that the company has the best pricing around! Will definitely use again.</Review>

Your crew called me 20 minutes before they arrived & were at my house in 22 minutes (which is amazing!), and in exactly 15 minutes, everything was taken care of (process explanation, junk load-up, payment and emailed receipt)! Plus your services were almost $200 less than the GOT-JUNK guys, and you hauled away more stuff! I will recommend you to everyone I know for your services, and look forward to using you again soon.< /review>

Louise was excellent! He had two employee's with him today. They did a great job. They cleared my dad's office. He was in business as an architect for over 50 years! I appreciate how professional Louise was from start to finish. He has excellent customer service. He called in advance of my appointment for a quote and the appointment today. I was really impressed with Junk King from start to finish. Thank you so much!!! Monica< /Text>

I have an awesome experience with Junk King. The three gentlemen that came to my house were polite and very quick. They were in and out of my house in less than 5 minutes. It was so quick and easy. I have tried other services, but I will go back and use Junk King again. It was quick and easy.< /Review>

Never would have imagined that 3 guys picking up junk would be so nice and cheerful! They came right on time, quickly removed the garbage I had from moving out of a house, and took some additional stuff at the landlord's request which was not on the original request. Cost was a little high, but hey, what else can you do with large junk?!?! Fast and friendly service. Definitely recommend!</Review>

<text>Great service, would definitely use them again.  Booked online.  They were on-time (actually, they were able to come about 30 min earlier than the chosen window, and confirmed that the time change was OK with a phone call), friendly, and courteous.  I had more to remove than I originally thought, but they were able to take it all - I asked the gentleman on the phone what would happen if they didn't have enough room and he assured me that if they couldn't take it all, they would make two trips.  Cost was really good.  They do an estimate when they get there, before starting removal, to ensure you're OK with the price.  Those guys are strong and fast!  Amazing the way they can toss around debris and heft this giant wood pallet I had to get rid of .  And neat too - they even swept up the garage where the pile of stuff was when they were done.  Very happy with their service and would recommend them to others.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

I scheduled someone to come to a look provide an estimate and remove junk if the pricing was acceptable. I received a call 15 minutes prior to arrival and  the crew arrived on time. Pricing was competitive so I went ahead and asked for junk removal. The crew was friendly and professional making sure to ask if there were any items I may have wanted to keep. Would recommend this service to anyone with tons of things to remove. Thank you!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

The team was professional, courteous and on-time.  They explained clearly the pricing, the options and the plan for hauling the junk away and worked with me every step of the way.  I could not have asked for a better experience.  The online pricing and appointment confirmation system worked without any hidden costs or vague details and is really appreciated compared to other options out there who try to make it difficult to get a straight-forward pricing plan.<//Review>

Just got off the phone with this arrogant person. He left a message, saying he's in my area and is 3 hours early, which is fine, and can pick up my mattress. I call back and say: "Sure! Oh, you guys take credit right?" - Him: "The thing with credit is that we have to write down the number because our (whatever he said) is broken." - Me: "Oh? Then can you come in like an hour so I can go to the bank?" - Him: "But we're in your area now." Me: "So, it's my fault you guys are 3 hours early?" Him: "No." Me: "Had I not called you back, would you have shown up at my scheduled time?" He tries to do a runaround, so I repeat my question. He eventually says: "Yes." Me: "There you go. I'm not having a stranger just write down my credit information on some piece of paper. I'll use someone else. Thanks." And I advise you doing the same. What a joke.</review>

I would rate the service at 5 stars or more  The guys were prompt, efficient and extremely patient with a very stressed out customer (me).  Even swept clean the sidewalk area where the junk had been piled.  Well worth the cost of the service.  You get what you pay for.  In this case, even more than I expected.🤗<//Review>

<review>Junk King is the best!!  I had the three most funny and wonderful guys do my job. This was a hard time for me as my mother had just passed. Watching all of her stuff going was so final. This crew made me laugh the whole time. They were efficient and thorough!  I will be using Junk King again in the near future as I will be moving.<//review><name>claudia murray< /name><Resp>None</Resp><time>1470240514129< /time>< pics>

Junk King was very professional and courteous. They showed up early to remove some old appliances that I needed taken away. I will use them again in the near future.</review>

<text>Just got off the phone with this arrogant person. He left a message, saying he's in my area and is 3 hours early, which is fine, and can pick up my mattress. I call back and say: "Sure! Oh, you guys take credit right?" - Him: "The thing with credit is that we have to write down the number because our (whatever he said) is broken." - Me: "Oh? Then can you come in like an hour so I can go to the bank?" - Him: "But we're in your area now." Me: "So, it's my fault you guys are 3 hours early?" Him: "No." Me: "Had I not called you back, would you have shown up at my scheduled time?" He tries to do a runaround, so I repeat my question. He eventually says: "Yes." Me: "There you go. I'm not having a stranger just write down my credit information on some piece of paper. I'll use someone else. Thanks." And I advise you doing the same. What a joke.<//text><Time>1513190090439<//Time><Resp>None<//Resp>< rating>

I liked that we were notified of when and how long before the truck would arrive to pick up our items, also liked that it was same day service. The guys who picked up our items were friendly and courteous and removed the items quickly and fairly quietly as well. We have used them in the past (2013) and will no doubt use their services again. Thank you.<//review>

<Review>Junk King is the best!!  I had the three most funny and wonderful guys do my job. This was a hard time for me as my mother had just passed. Watching all of her stuff going was so final. This crew made me laugh the whole time. They were efficient and thorough!  I will be using Junk King again in the near future as I will be moving.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

The service was very easy to use. I took a picture of our cabinets and texted it to Junk King. I had an estimate within 15 minutes and an appointment set up. I would for sure use this service again.</text>

<Review>Junk King is great! I constantly hear the commercials for 1800**otherservice** on the radio but their initial quote was way to high and their operator/sales kept pushing their service and wouldn't let me end the phone call.  Scheduled with Junk King for next day pickup and their base fee was reasonable and their higher rates much more affordable than their competitors.  Would recommend to anyone looking to clear out unwanted trash and items.< /Review>< pics>

Hello, I had recently moved and it was a process for sure. On three aoccasions had Junk Kings come out, they were always respectable, strong and capable men to assist in a timely fashion. Talking about affordable & reasonable prices. I would recommend to my family friends! C.S< /text>

<Review>I would rate the service at 5 stars or more  The guys were prompt, efficient and extremely patient with a very stressed out customer (me).  Even swept clean the sidewalk area where the junk had been piled.  Well worth the cost of the service.  You get what you pay for.  In this case, even more than I expected.🤗< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

I had the need for the unique services provided by Junk King among other companies in that business, but I chose Junk King because they had the best prices and I had the best experiences with their phone representative.
I was extremely pleased to find that the personnel who arrived to remove my items were not only personable, but did their very best to meet any extra needs of their customers. I highly recommend Junk King to anyone who needs to de-clutter their personal environment.</text>

Junk King came quickly. They gave me a general bid once I sent a picture. Once they arrived, we diacussed what needed to be tossed, a mix of construction debris, wood, and granite. Fair pricing, excellent service, very professional. Wuickly clean up. So nice to have all of my junk gone! Highly recommend them.< /Text>

I called five times from 1:30pm to 3:30pm and was promised a follow up phone call all five times. No one called me back. Very Unprofessional. I have used them in the past for junk pick up on four different properties that I manage and have had other issues with the amount they charged, pushing for a tip and late arrival times. It is Friday afternoon at 4:00pm and I am left scrambling to find junk pick up for a full truck. I will never use them again.</text>< pics>

I have and still do recommend you guys to all our friends. It's so easy to schedule, the prices are so fair and your guys are always so polite and punctual. I think we've used you 3 or 4 times and will continue :)</Review>

< Review>
Luis and his team mate were on time, courteous, actively seeking solutions to unforeseen problems, and thoroughly cleaned up after the job. The job turned out to be more than initially estimated because the Jacuzzi was half buried in the ground and the space was back filled with sand. They worked with me with ideas to remove as much material as feasible at a reasonable charge, about $90 more than the initial estimate, which is fair and not excessive. In addition, Luis offered to remove any remaining materials free of charge should I need at a later time. I am very pleased with their professionalism. I'd highly recommend them.< /Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>I contacted them by sending an email via their link on the website home page. This was my first time inquiring about their services and didn't know if I'd get a fairly quick reply or any at all. As prompted I made an appointment for a two-hour time window the very next morning (10am-12pm) and it was about 430pm when I sent this initial message.
I was pleased to see a very timely reply to my email saying that my appointment was confirmed for the next morning. It also said I would would receive a call from their driver about 20 min. before they arrived at my address. I had a few items to be picked up by them and was curious about the potential cost so I was pleased to find an 'estimator-type' tool on their webpage. It was easy to use and soon had a rough idea of what I'd be paying. I'd initially planned on loading up my small-bed truck with this stuff to take to the dump but found out it would have quite expensive to 'dump' these items directly at a local place. I figured, heck, it's going to be pricey anyway so I'll see how this Junk King thing works out.
I was glad I did. They called me 20 min into my two-hour appointment window and said they'd be there in about 20-25 min. They were prompt and professional as the three guys got out of their truck and followed me to my backyard. They quickly gave me an estimate which was more than fair and hustled the stuff away. I got a receipt via email as they said would. I paid less cash than if I took care of the junk myself and gave them a nice tip for their great service. Good job, guys!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<review>I called the day before and gave all details of the item I needed taken away, they gave me a quote that sounded great but when the movers showed up they said "oh no those guys aren't supposed to give quotes over the phone" and told me the price they would charge was more than double the price I was quoted. Feels like a scam. They show up to your house and bump the price so you feel on the spot to accept the new price. I would not trust this company</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

< review>
I called the day before and gave all details of the item I needed taken away, they gave me a quote that sounded great but when the movers showed up they said "oh no those guys aren't supposed to give quotes over the phone" and told me the price they would charge was more than double the price I was quoted. Feels like a scam. They show up to your house and bump the price so you feel on the spot to accept the new price. I would not trust this company</review>

David and Darnold removed our spa and television as well as an old bike and some small pieces of wood in a timely manner at a good price. I would recommend Junk King as an excellent service and quality price for those who need junk hauled away.</Review>

Excellent service. I use them all the time for my demolition debris removal or furnitures or bascally anything I need to get rid of. They are quick and prompt, very reasonably priced. Sometime even can come on the same day I call.
If you look for a junk removal company, look no further.<//Review>

Just had one of their trucks going down our street (residential non-main thoroughfare) at 65mph. Wonderful business allowing unsafe drivers to drive at high rates of speed through a residential neighborhood. Will they haul the child away after they kill them? Get your drivers in line.</Text>
