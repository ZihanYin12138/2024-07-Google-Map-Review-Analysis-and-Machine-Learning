They were able to get my dog in on short notice same day I called 2 days in a row. Everyone i spoke with was so nice and caring and compassionate. The vet got a foxtail out of my dogs nose and now he's back to normal.<//Review>

<review>True to there word. I was sceptical with all this covid stuff, it possibly could be a long wait. Pulled into a parking area, called the number, 5 minutes a rep was outside greeting me and my pet. She took necessary data, and my concerns, and took my dog inside. 10 minutes after, the vet called me and gave me her recommendations. Brought my dog back, paid at the car,and on our way home. 30 maybe 40 min.
Outstanding!</review><Date>1616980281279< /Date><pictures>None</pictures><userid>116981651475671502933</userid><gmapID>0x809526229111d7d9:0x53f9d879e28517b9< /gmapID></record>

<text>This was my baby's very first time going to a veterinarian. He is a rescue, with a lot of trauma and anxiety which unfortunately burdens him with aggressive outbursts. I was extremely nervous about exposing him to a new environment (owners with traumatized rescues know exactly what I mean) and I COULDN'T HAVE ASKED FOR A BETTER TEAM OF PROFESSIONALS.  Staff was very PATIENT and GENTLE with Scooby. I did not feel rushed or pressured. Thank you so much. I would 110% recommend this clinic.</text><GmapID>0x809526229111d7d9:0x53f9d879e28517b9< /GmapID>< pics>

These kind & caring vet personnel are real troopers.  I was a big fan before the Covid mess, but they really stepped up this last year: taking in patients from other clinics, and always being available to my little boy's needs. Thanx from the bottom of my heart.</Text>

The attention to the animals is good but the prices are ridiculously high and they try tack on every extra  test and procedure they can to jack the price up. Make sure and look at your bill carefully.<//Review>

We have been bringing all our fur babies to Care at the Courtyard for over 10 years. Dr. Chris Peterson is the main reason we go there. He is great with all our animals, always gives options with treatment plans and follows up with a phone call once home to see how our pet is doing!< /Text>

Great experience with my two kitties.  It might be a little more pricey but worth it with their quality of care. My babies were in great hands. The doctor personally came out to my car because of covid and gave me the needs, not pushing anything extra. They totally understood my finances and told me what they recommend but also told me what I should do for now. Greatly appreciated their advice. Punky Jo and Jade will be back!! Thanks staff..u were all very polite<//Text>

I have been going to Care at the Courtyard (started at the old Care Vet location) for thirty years.  This group of people are so compassionate--from the front desk to the doctors.  I wouldn't trust my fur babies with any other vet, and I have had a few with issues.  This group has seen my pets from the beginning to the end, always treating them like they would their own.< /review>

<review>I recently had to make the hard decision to let one of my babies go to the rainbow bridge, after battling years of epilepsy. She was allergic to any medication that would control her seizures, so we opted to give her CBd and let her live as long as she could with quality. That being said, my vet met with me on her day off to look at her and to give me advice, and after gave me her personal number to call or text any concerns or questions I may have had. Almost two years later I had to have Gigi put down, it was a rough time, but the staff were so caring and helpful. The vet examined her and let me know I was making the right decision. There were tears In the eyes of the staff as they spoke with me and comforted me, that meant a lot and showed me that they care. A couple of days later I received a beautiful card in the mail letting me know how sorry they were for my loss, enclosed was the rainbow bridge poem. I will forever take my pets to a place where they care not only for the animals with compassion and love, they care for the person as well. I highly recommend this vet clinic.<//review><UserId.>111953371150620092498< /UserId.></record>

<rating>1</rating><Text>After 15+ years of taking my animals to this clinic it impresses me now as a money mill with too many patients. They were unable to find time during their business hours to attend to my pet that had been sick for 14 days and under their care during that time. She was dying. My advice is to find a smaller compassionate veterinary business.< /Text>< Pictures>

{'time': 1603751739755, 'text': "Anita,\nI would first like to express my condolences with the loss of your kitty. Everyone at Care At The Courtyard Veterinary Clinic is saddened by your loss. We are all pet owners and understand the importance of animal family members.\nI have had the chance to talk to staff, doctors, and the manager regarding the circumstances of this review.\nDuring this time of COVID, we have faced challenges in many areas.\n~Because many of our employees are mothers, they are spending extra time away from work to be with their children as they battle through the Zoom Online Education.\n~If an employee or doctor has any sign of illness whatsoever, they are asked to stay home and seek medical attention. This is in an effort to protect clients and staff from potential contagious disease.\n~In order to provide the safest environment for everyone, we are continuing curbside service. The hot days have been challenging to staff and clients. Efficiency is of upmost importance to provide comfort to clients and staff and provide safety to pets.\n~In order to abide by and provide the highest standards of care for our patients, we are limited with work-in appointments and cannot see new clients.\nWith all the challenges above, the team at Care at the Courtyard is working long days to provide care for as many patients as possible. Unfortunately, we find ourselves with previously unforeseen limitations.\nI know that Baby was well-loved and I can see that you went above and beyond in her care. You did diagnostics and treatment at our hospital. During your last appointment, the doctor that treated Baby noted that a series of contrast x-rays would be the next step if Baby did not improve in the next 24-48 hours. 4 days later, I see that you called to inquire about feeding recommendations. A day later, you called requesting an appointment. All we had available was a 10:00am appointment and you declined that appointment time. The doctor recommended emergency care at a 24 hour Veterinary Emergency Hospital in Fresno, since we had no other appointments available that day. The following day, our manager called to inform you of another appointment time that came available. This message was left on your answering machine.\nWe did not learn of Baby's passing until after this review.\nAgain, I am truly sorry for your loss. We did our best to accommodate your needs and to provide you with alternative care options."}</Resp>

My puppy had 4 canine teeth removed and I was so worried about her surgery. The vet and technicians took such good care of her and by the evening, she was back to her playful little self! I feel like the staff at Care of the Courtyard care for their “patients” like they were their own. Thank you Dr.Johnson and Staff!!</Text>

I am so happy with Courtyard veterinary clinic. I left another clinic 2 years ago because they could never fit me in when I had what I felt was urgent for one of my pets. Courtyard did just that. I went in early 7:30 AM in the morning and they gave me an appointment for 9:00 AM but told me if I waited possibly I could be squeezed in and I was. They were gentle with my cat they were gentle with me. I would recommend them to anyone! They are so respectful of my desires for my animals & don’t try to push me or insist on treatments I am against but explain everything I need to know. I’m very happy here💖< /text>

Care at the courtyard has been a pleasure to work with these last 4 years. Doctors are thorough and give you all your options including estimates for any procedures etc done at their office.  I am very satisfied with the care my pets have enjoyed here. I highly recommend this Veterinary office<//Text>

I am so thankful for Dr. Proctor for the time he took with Lucy who is in failing health and explaining my options. His explanations were easy to understand and clear. He was compassionate and understanding. I wouldn't go anywhere else.< /review>

I am glad that I chose this place to bring my dog to when he has non stop diarrhea for a week.  The Dr was very knowledgeable.  I told them I don't want a bunch of different tests done, I just want to focus on the diarrhea.  They did limited tests and was able to find the issue.  Gave him some meds and it cleared up within days.  Thank you so much!</text>

Was quoted $50 each, fee for consultation appointment for neutering one dog, spaying another. Bill was $468. Quote for the appointment to have both my dogs fixed is $900. They did most of it THEN presented the bill as opposed to asking my permission FIRST, THEN proceeding with all the unnecessary treatments. I'm very disheartened to say the least and WILL NOT go back for any further treatment of any kind for any pets. What a bummer. I feel very much taken advantage of.< /text>

Staff is friendly and professional. I called to get my boxer in because she was sick and they got her in the same when 5 other Vets said not opening for a week because they were booked. Once there the staff was great and friendly Vet explained our options and great at answering our questions. Definitely will recommend and worth the drive from Porterville..</Review>

My dog, Stella, needed to be seen immediately and they squeezed her in for an appointment on a busy Friday afternoon. Their staff seems to truly care for animals. Stella has severe anxiety and Dr. Johnson tried different methods to help her feel comfortable. She’s great and I plan on continuing to take Stella to Care At the Courtyard.< /text>

<Review>The Dr. who assisted me with the passing of my 17yr old part Maine Coon cat, Sammy, was so Kind, very Caring, and Extremely helpful with the whole process.
Even though it was very hard and heartbreaking, with the help of the Vet I knew I was absolutely making the best choice for my 4 legged Friend.
She passed in Grace and is resting in Peace  in a grape vineyard.
I'm grateful to Care At the Courtyard Vet.
You won't be sorry if you choose to have them care for your Animals.<//Review>< Date>

<review>We just started taking our pets to Care At the Courtyard a little over 4 months ago. The care we see given to each pet is amazing.  They truly listen. Also the options are all put out on the table up front. No hidden costs.  The staff are very professional.  The doctors are amazing and take care of my pets as if they were their own.</review>< pics>

Worst veterinarian care! They don’t have a genuine care for the animals! Prices are ridiculous, and BEWARE they will tell you things are wrong with your animal, that are NOT! Get a second opinion if you choose to see these people! Terrible service, charged me for fitting my dog into the schedule, but never advised me of it before hand! My friend advised me they were ripping people off and told me to take my fur boy to another vet! Took her advise, my dog was up and running around in two days! TRUST ME, you have been warned! If you love your pet, take them elsewhere!</text>

The staff was friendly and informative. They diagnosed the problem with my dog and consulted us with what was the best solution and the cost of it. I appreciated how quickly things progressed, and the care they gave my dog. I would recommend Care at the Courtyard to anyone who love their animals and want the best care and results.<//Text>

<Text>I will never go back here. I refrain from giving them one star because I hold myself partly responsible. I should have not blinded trusted this vet. I should have asked more questions, etc. My healthy young cat got an infection. The vet gave him Convenia. He got better but developed a heart murmur, which was diagnosed the morning of his neuter a week later. We were given the option of taking him to Fresno for a heart exam or to go thru w/ the neuter. We went through with the neuter because we thought it could have been from stress. I should have demanded blood work be done. In fact, looking back, all of my previous vets required blood work with any anesthesia. This might have discovered that he was anemic. I suspect from the Convenia. There is documentation online that this drug can cause this. I have been in contact with people whose pets died from anemia from this drug. The surgery required a second injection of this drug. I did questioned it but this vet assured us it would be fine. My cat died 5 days later from severe anemia. I spent over 2K on him and could not afford an autopsy. Plus, I was too distraught to even consider it at the time. Please question this vet or any vet. Research the drugs they give your babies. I am devastated. I wish this vet would have immediately considered other reasons for the murmur since it was undetected in 2 recent visits before doing the surgery. My cat might still be alive.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x809526229111d7d9:0x53f9d879e28517b9<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Love this place. The staff are prompt and welcoming. I’ve never waited to be called back. I had so many off topic questions that the tech really took the time to listen to and answer. The doctor was very thorough and even looked into some information for me and called me back a couple hours after I left. I like how they give the doggie shots in front of you in the room, whereas previous vets would take my dog in a backroom so I never knew how well they did with other people. You can tell they love what they do! I’ll definitely be a lifelong customer.< /Review>

<Text>The first time we visited the Courtyard was a sad day as we had to have our very old dog put down. We were so impressed with the way that the staff handled that situation, that we brought our new puppy in for his first vet visit a year later. We were not disappointed! Thank you to Dr. Peterson, Bre Garcia,  and the rest of the great staff. We have definitely found our permanent animal care provider. You will be well served to do likewise!

<Name>heyitsbinx _</Name><text>My Dex was having urinary problems. I was told by another vet that it was okay to wait. After speaking to some friends, they recommended that I have him seen sooner. Care at the Courtyard wasted no time squeezing him in on clearly a busy day to have him seen immediately. From the receptionist, the techs and the veterinarian the experience was such a pleasant one! My anxious kitty was handled with such gentle care and everyone was incredibly informative to helping me understand what was going on with him and why.

I will definitely be bringing Dex back here for regular care as well as my other two cats!</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< user>

We raise service dogs for Canine Companions and wouldn't think of taking them anywhere else but Care at the Courtyard Veterinary Clinic.  We are impressed with the caring Dr. Johnson has given all our dogs over the last several years.  We have a pet golden retriever who also loves Dr. Johnson.  She never is scared to go to the vet!  The staff is helpful, courteous and professional. The wait time is minimal.<//review>

< review>
Now, over a year later, several employees turned over, and I need to change my review.  We have started to transfer all our remaining pets in our extended family to Care Veterinary Clinic.  Having been with Care at the Courtyard for almost 15 years, the customer service and office professionalism is no longer at the level I trust my animals with.  A recent situation put our beloved dog at risk and it was only our diligence as pet parents that prevented a possible medical emergency. The decline in service started well before the COVID crisis, so I find no excuses acceptable.

The team at Care at the Courtyard have been so supportive of our family and our pets.  Particularly Dr. Sawyer, Dr Sonja, and all the support staff.
They have helped to ease our pain during the loss of our pet and been proactive in treating life threatening illnesses in our last two dogs.  Both have good prognosis and Dr. Sawyer has given us the facts to make good, informed decisions.  When the time comes to make tough choices or share the silliness of our goofy animals, I know the staff will take the time to listen.</review>

I heard Dr. Peterson was good. We had to transfer our pup after leaving the emergency room, and the staff recommended court yard. I strongly felt like they didn’t pay attention to our dog, and we stated that taking our dog to fresno would be considered a lot especially for young adults. Not to mention when we picked up his medicine, they gave 1 set of wrong pills they gave us someone else’s dogs pills. I wouldn’t recommend this place, they don’t see genuine at all. Also the Vet said that my dog was mostly not gonna make it because he didn’t look good, and i explained to him that our dog was just scared and nervous, he said so many dogs come in he’s fine. Then he called and said he was doing better, our dog was just nervous and he made it seem like he wasn’t gonna make it!< /text>

I love this Veterinary clinic.  My dog has seen 3 different Vets here and each one has been amazing! Great personalities, each one made it obvious that they care; Dr. Johnson and Dr. Belknap are especially great.

The front desk receptionist are also great, including the Vet nurses/assistants.  The best part is, every time I've had an appointment, I only had to wait maybe 5 minutes tops.  Never experienced that before with another Vet or (especially) a non-animal treating doctor.

Also, they are accommodating! They were booked for the day and were able to get me an appointment with short notice.

Great place, I wouldn't want to take my dogs anywhere else.</review>

Dr. Chris Peterson is a remarkable veterinarian.  Not only does Dr. Peterson have really good clinical skills but, he is also an excellent surgeon.  I have had numerous female cats spayed by Dr. Peterson and the resulting incisions are almost invisible. Plus, the cats are always fully awake and playful....amazing!

The staff at Care at the Courtyard are also excellent.  Very friendly and courteous!< /Text>

They were able to bring our sick cat Flip-Flop in on the same day without the appointment, they were able to squeeze us in just 2 hours ahead, when no other vets in town would assist us.
Much appreciated to you Sonya!!!!!
Very professional and great work done for our sick cat.
Thank you

<review>We having been coming to Care for over 9 years, we now have three Aussie which are rather hyper dogs, they welcome them with scratches, smiles and pets; this clinic is kept clean and comfortable. There are several staff and vets, which  are all friendly and professional with us and of course with the dogs.
At one point we suspected the dogs had kennel cough, the vet came out to the car, checked all three dogs and returned to administer shots. There has never been a time that our dogs were in there for something other than routine visits that we didn't receive a follow up call to see how they were doing after a procedure.
The prices are competitive, location is central and hours of operation are convenient.
They are five star.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x809526229111d7d9:0x53f9d879e28517b9<//Gmap_id></record>

I love how clean the clinic is and how fast you get in to see the vet. I don't like the prices they are high but I keep going because the staff is very good and the doctor's are all very good. Because of the price I only gave it 4 stars but I guess you get what you pay for. I use to use a clinic who had really cheap prices but I quit going because you had to wait 2 hours to see the vet and it smelled like a kennel. So like I said you get what you pay for but what I love about this clinic is they have a vet for birds. The only one around here that I could find and she does a great job. I have 5 dogs,1 parrot and all have went to this clinic.</Text>

This place is beyond words wonderful. The best place I have ever taken my dogs. I want to give a shout out to Dr. Johnson who is the main one we were speaking to. The amount of care is among anything I could've hoped for. We got referred to take our dog to a specialist and got calls from care at the courtyard to see how she was doing. Our dogs life was saved thanks to the amazing amount of care and compassion from everyone involved.< /Review>

We have taken our cats and dogs to Care at the Courtyard for well over 10 years. The vets and staff are caring and supportive of the animals as well as the pets owners. We especially like Dr Sawyer and Dr Johnson, who both give excellent explanations about immunizations, diagnosis and any required medications. Their love of animals is apparent! Thank you for your kindness, humor, and professionalism.<//text>

I really appreciated the help and suggestions from your front desk gal Andrea. She is outstanding and obviously really cares about your patients and their owners. The food I decided to try based on her recommendation (Hill's Ideal Balance Natural Chicken and Brown Rice) is the first kibble that Brigitte has eaten with gusto and that I may have to limit the amount I put in her dish. I came back and purchased the large bag which you special ordered for me.

My family feels very lucky that we moved into the neighborhood near Care at the Courtyard nine years ago and found you. The care of our pets has been outstanding.</review>

This was our first visit at Care At the Courtyard Vet Clinic to establish care for our 2 dogs.  We were greeted and instantly felt welcomed.  The staff are professional and friendly and genuinely love animals and their jobs.  They went above and beyond to help us with our dogs that were stressed out from being evacuated from the Rough Fire.  From the receptionist, the techs, and the Dr we felt that we were a priority and our animals came first.  We are so happy with the care we received and look forward to seeing them all for our animals' checkups in December.<//review>

The front desk staff are helpful and kind.  The doctors seem to have a lot of experience and offer a variety of treatment options. It is not the least expensive Vet office in town but it is a quality affair in which you find comfort and confidence. Wish I could give it more like a 4.5<//Review>

Liked the vet but questioned their charges. Quoted one price charged me differently. Ask for prescription for dog meds so I could mail order them. less expensive. They adjusted my visit charge then I got a letter in the mail telling me not to come back and find another vet. Guess you can't queston them or their fees.< /review>

Care at the Courtyard is peopled with absolutely wonderful personnel who take a genuine interest in the 'furry' members of your family.  They are knowledgable, helpful, caring, and willing to take those extra steps which mean so much when we're distressed over our pets' health.  We couldn't be more pleased with the care our Dogs and Cats have received, and even on the darkest days, when one of our special fiends crosses the Rainbow Bridge, the staff and Doctors lend a helping and supportive hand.  Can't say enough good things.  Thank you for all you do.<//Text>< rating>

The staff here are truly amazing, they are caring, friendly and professional.  Any time I have had a question they take the time to explain what I need to know.  After sadly having one of my pets put to sleep here, I received a card and follow up phone calls from the Vet that had taken care of things (thank you Dr Holly).  My current pets are taken here and I wouldn't trust their care to anyone else.  If you are looking for a trustworthy Veterinary Clinic that is going to care about your pets, this is the place to go!< /text>

We have been going here for 16 years now. They will do their best to work with your budget and understand not everyone is rich. They are knowledgeable about our dogs medical issues (epilepsy, renal failure, heart murmur, hip dysplasia, senior pets). All the veterinarians will sit and listen to your questions or concerns and can explain everything to where you understand. Fees are resonable, veterinarians are polite, they love all breeds of dogs, clean facility.</Text>

Sell quite a bit of products. Just be careful they are a bit pricey. $48.00 for the office visit alone. Worth it but it adds up.</Review>< name>

Great experience. Staff is genuinely caring. Dr. Sonja Peterson went above & beyond in the care of our dog, Romina. Randi is top notch. Andrea & the front office team, the best. Definitely recommend to anyone seeking compassionate care for their pets.< /text>

If you want your dog to be experimented on and die without good veterinary practice this is it. My golden had gone here for years. He was 6 years old and was currently diagnosed with a mast tumor (size of a quarter) by Dr. Peterson and soon after he was poked for a sample of it, it got infected and made his body react so badly that my dogs leg grew with an infection/tumor. Long story short, my dog ripped it off because it had gotten so unbearable. Took him in again to Dr. Johnson and she freaked out because it had gotten so bad that she canceled his surgery he had the following day and said he would have to see a board certified surgeon specialist and that it could get pricey blah blah blah. She was nervous because of what had come of this. It's really none of her business how expensive it gets so it really bothered me that she judged us. She was also nervous because they screwed up! Fortunately, I called places all over Southern California and got him in the following day to a board certified vet surgeon. He said care at the courtyard NEVER took the right measures in testing his tumor. NEVER took X-rays, blood work, ultrasound and went straight to poking the small mass that became infected on his whole leg! His leg wasn't able to be operated on or anything because of the severity. These vets cut my golden retrievers life short. They may have the title, but certainly don't know how to treat your pets. Beware: Don't go here. I have other dogs that will never be seeing these wannabe vets.<//text>

<Text>About 15 years ago we moved from our then current Vet Hospital to Care at the Courtyard because our two favorite Dr.'s moved to Care. We have been there ever since and we still work with our favorite Dr. We have 3 dogs and 3 cats so we visit Care at the Courtyard frequently. There are numerous excellent Dr.'s there and we have been happy with all including the staff and the front desk personal.

The name Care fits them well and their follow up after a visit or procedure is reassuring. I would recommend them to others looking for a Vet.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<text>Care has taken care of both my dogs for 15 years.  They are both deceased now, the most recent in November 2013.  I now have another dog that will start her care at the clinic this week.  The doctors there are best to be found anywhere.  The employees and the Drs. are friendly, caring and genuine.  As long as I have an animal, Care is where they will taken to be cared for.  Care at the Courtyard can't be outdone.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Text>I have been taking my dog to Care for the past 3 years... now I have two adopted cats and they continue to keep all my pets healthy and happy. They might not be the cheapest, but they are still very price concientious while maintaining a high level of care. My schedule is never very flexible, so I don't have one consistent Dr., but I've been happy with all of them. :)<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>We have used Care At the Courtyard for our last two dogs and for our current two dogs.  All of the veterinarians are top-notch.  Recently we had to have our 17 year old dog put to sleep, and the compassion exhibited by all the staff was great as my wife and I were devastated and they helped us through it.

i want to single out Barb Johnson for how she handled this experience.

But, know that throughout the 7 years we had with Buddy, and the six years we had with Slinky at Care, they diagnosed several things early that helped each dog prolong their  lives by several years.

Now with Maverick and Patches, our two newest dogs rescued from various shelters, we anticipate many more happy years.

Thank you Drs. Johnson, Campbell, Petersen, Petersen, and Sawyer for all your wonderful care over the years.<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>The staff is so caring and humanely good to all its friends that pass through their doors. I have a kind but rowdy Pitbull teen that has a 200+ pound pull. The vet team is totally unintimidated by my Jeremiah. They are able and willing to help him with his needs. I love them for that alone.
(I've been to another vet that was clearly and rudely quite the opposite, so I have something tangible for comparison's sake.)
Care at the Courtyard pricing is competitively affordable. The structure and grounds are immaculate. Give them a try with your loved pet. You'll be so pleased. Also, they will do their best to squeeze you in within a 24-hour period for non-emergency, yet, a hasty essential visit.

This facility is well maintained and has a remarkable staff. There isn't enough praise I could give for them in caring for the animals I have taken there for treatment. They go above and beyond!< /Review>

<Text>This is the only vet I will take my pit bull to! She has gone here since she was a puppy and never once was she judged nor did we feel as if the dr. was scared of her as other vet offices have done that.
They are pretty informative. Any time my dog has had to go under anesthesia the dr. Calls us to inform us on how our baby is doing!
The place is very clean and staff has always been friendly to us!< /Text>< pics>

I called first thing in the morning and they got me an appt for 12:30 that afternoon. As soon as I pulled up, I called in and someone came right out, got the info and within about 5 minutes came and took my cat inside. 15 minutes later my pet was returned, I paid with a credit card and we were on our way home. I've been using CATC for over 10 years and really do appreciate their service and the care they show for all pets.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<rate>5</rate><Text>Care at the Courtyard has nursed our many cats through their wellness, sickness and death needs for over 15 years.  I trust them completely.  We get in to see them easily, the staff are all kind and knowledgeable, and they all know us and our cats by name.  Whether our kitties have been struggling with diseases, abscess, or accidents, they've nursed them back to health with good advice, correct diagnoses, and meds that work for our individual cats' persnickety needs.  They make follow up calls to see how kits are doing.  They've suggested even options for food that have kept kitties healthy and happy, and handle our cats with care and kindness, even some of our more cranky guys.  They set out options when care is needed to work with us and what is best for our pets--being sensitive to $ as well as what's best for the animal.  They take time with questions, all questions.  When we've had to put down three of our many beloved furpals, they have been sensitive, concerned, caring, and again, have always done not just follow-up cards and calls, but even remembered to ask how WE were doing on the next visit with remaining pets.  I recommend them to everyone, and while all the docs are terrific, a special shout out goes to Dr. Campbell, who also teaches in the Vet program at the local college.  All the doctors are competent, experienced, and extremely helpful, and keep up to date with continuing professional training and the newest equipment for the clinic.  These guys at Care know what they are doing and do it well. We are sure we have placed our wee buddies in the best hands possible.  We would not consider other vets after being fortunate enough to find Care.  They are simply the best.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

They have been our vet for years with many of my animals. They have a large and friendly staff so you can get in and out in a short time. Prices are fair I never feel ripped off. Facility is newer and always clean. We just got a puppy who is a little mental and they offered to help socialize him. So I have been taking him 1-2 times a week and they pet him and take him around to different people. He went from being scared and growling to super happy and peeing (he still needs work).

We also had to put a dog down recently and did it there. In no way can this ever be a good experience however they have a side office you can go into and exit when it's over and offer you as much time as you need. So they really make you feel comfortable during this hard time.<//Text>

I do not recommend Dr. Peterson at all, he is not able to take care of my German shepherds puppy which was very anxious on the day of surgery.
I already asked him to give my dog some medication to make him calm at the day of surgery. But he said just bring him and I put him on sleep .
I am at the door of vet and they excused to see my dog for surgery almost $500 , because he is barking and anxouis!
What is the job of the vet and their assistants.
I came to this office since he was 7 weeks

Honestly I've changed my Vet from Dr. Suwyer to Dr. Peterson  guessing now my puppy is very big almost 1 year he can take care of him better than her. Unfortunately he isnot,...
All my vaccination and surgery has done on this office and he knew that my dog is healthy maybe anxious  ( he is not in contact with other dogs too much and most of the day alone because I am at work).

I do not recommend this place at all.
If you have a calm and sick and old  dog and you have money maybe works for you.
So sorry for dr. Peterson who was scared of my dog to treat him isn't funny and at the same time frustrating!?

Thank you for wrong response.
I already asked dr. Peterson to give lex medication to calm him down and and they just want to sell their new medication for put him on sleep which obviously could not give him other medication before.

Yes, I called to other place they charging me half the price for everything that you suppose to charge me about $500 and when I told them about lex behavior and ask for medication they asked the doctor and they advice me to give him benadryl with the recommended dosage before bring him in.

I knew your place is pricey and I was hoping your service was matching with it. Which unfortunately not, at least for me.

Good luck

Maybe now you are happy when hearing that after not accepting my German shepherd dog which is only 1 year old puppy, my dog bite one neighbor who came at my back yard door.
And now they  (ANIMAL CONTROL)wants him to put him on sleep, basically KILL MY PUPPY,
because you specially the doctors and nurses who refuse doing the surgery who I had appointment for that and I called several time before coming to your vet to let you know my dog is barking and you knew that from last visit and refuse to give him tranquilizer before bring him in.
No I am not coming over there anymore and leave you to God.
I came there for help and the doctor have to be responsible.you cannot just refuse knowingly my dog is a little aggressive and actually I was hoping by Nutered him that day , help him to come down.</text>

<response>{'time': 1538085858797, 'text': "First off, I understand your frustration in our hospital not being able to see your pet.  I realize that your time is valuable and you took time to bring Lex in for a neuter.  After talking to doctors and staff, it sounds like you have your hands full.  We all think that you are doing your part and the best you can do to manage your 11 month old German Shepherd; but it is our policy to not put any of our patients, clients,  or staff at risk by subjecting them to an aggressive and potentially dangerous pet.  At our hospital, we have families, children, and other pets in the waiting room and in the parking area.  Dangerous and unmanageable pets are too great of a liability.  When I received a call from my office manager 3 weeks ago after Lex's visit, where he was muzzled and only a minimal exam could be performed, I stated that we needed to refer you elsewhere.  Dr. Chris Peterson was the one who rallied for you and strongly urged me to allow him to neuter Lex to see if this helped with the behavior issues you have been battling.  After today's encounter where you were unable to manage Lex and a potential dangerous situation was about to escalate, Dr. Chris Peterson demonstrated wise and professional judgement in not allowing Lex to enter the facility.  No one wants to hear that they have a challenging and aggressive patient.  I understand you being upset, but we are doing our best to keep the Care at the Courtyard family (clients, patients, and staff) safe and free from harm.  We truly wish you the best at your new veterinary practice, but please forewarn the receptionist about Lex's anxiety and aggressive nature.  Dr. Bryan Proctor"}< /response>< gmapID>

<rating>1<//rating><text>What a joke this place is!!  I take my dog in for a large an allergic reaction that swelled up to the size of a golf ball on her eye,  which she scratched and tore skin...Dr didn't even touch my dog.  Not even to take her temperature. Yet,  they are quick to give me an estimate of $850 for multiple test.  Asked for antibiotics the next day and was told the Dr called me.  Nope... when I stated this,  nicely,  I was pretty much told I was a liar. Rude!  Lol, wow. Tell me,  why would I lie about something like that? What do I get out of it? After that,  I decided,  never going back! Well today,  I get a letter,  mind you,  I NEVER EXPRESSED ANY OF MY CONCERNS WITH ANY STAFF MEMBERS,  NOT ONCE,  but today I get a letter from them stating "their are certain staff members and dr that no longer want to work with you." That's laughable! Can you believe the audacity of this place?

I was never rude , loud and I never got in anyone's face about the lack of skill they possess.  I was quiet,  paid my bill and found a BETTER vet to take my dog to.

I did NOT recommend this place at all. The other reviews (bad) are spot on!< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

{'time': 1541470103225, 'text': 'I am so sorry you have had the misfortune of dealing with Canine Parvovirus, but I am happy your dog is doing well.  Parvovirus is an unpredictable disease that claims many lives every year.  Vaccines are very effective in preventing the disease and at Care Veterinary Clinic and Care at the Courtyard Veterinary  Clinic we use only the highest quality vaccines and they carry with them a guarantee. We do our best preventing the spread of contagious disease and that is why you were asked to wait in you vehicle with your pet until an exam room was available.  I apologize that it took 30 minutes in order to secure and disinfect a room for you.  I assure you that you were not forgotten.  In clinic testing told us that your pet was actively shedding the virus so we worked hard to insure no other pets would be exposed to this virus.  Immediate and aggressive treatment are always the best options in treating Parvovirus.  I am a little confused by your post...are you hoping to continue your education in veterinary medicine?  If so, you will understand the significance of contagious disease and the disinfecting process to eliminate disease transmission to other pets.  You will also learn to understand the best treatment options available for patients, and the importance of vaccinating to help prevent disease.  Above all else, you will learn effective communication. I hold this profession dear to my heart, and advise you to study hard if you have plans of joining this profession.

<gmapID>0x809526229111d7d9:0x53f9d879e28517b9</gmapID><Text>We called to make a appointment cause my dog was sick ( I call and they answer normally I asked for pricing for a consultation and they ask me what’s wrong with the pup and I proceed to give them the information and she tells me right away over the phone without seeing the puppy that he has parvo very unprofessional) so we get there on time just for them to tell my husband and I we have to wait outside in our vehicle 30 mins go by I go inside to fallow up on our appointment only for the lady to tell me they had forgotten about us. After they take us in .They basically take  a parvo test but they do not take his temperature or take his weight I had to request personally request this finally his diagnoses was that he was positive for parvo and they said that they can give me antibiotics in order to try to save his life, I told the doctor that as a medicine student there’s nothing to combat a virus so the antibiotics were not  going to do anything for him I requested the helper to get another test cause  the symptoms were not anything like  parvo to me cause I checked his poop (adding h2o2 in order to detect blood test that we learn on medicine school )and there was no traces of blood they said it is parvo! I requested another test in order to know if he had  parasites the helper said that he need take this medication and she cannot get another test cause parvo was “”super positive “ so I told her so you can not get another test that I’m requesting she said no! I said ok can you please take his temperature she said that it wasn’t necessary but ok! So after taking his temperature after I requested it And the temperature was normal she try’d  to tell my husband that if we didn’t do the antibiotics The puppy would surely die (I then told her antibiotics is not going to do nothing for a virus )so I asked for my bill to pay and I left!!! Terrible attitude I do not recommend this place because  to me they are not honest and they missed the basic test to get a diagnosis. By the way after I treated my dog with.5 ml of erofloxacin and b 12 plus pedialyte he is jumping and playing this morning! So again it wasn’t parvovirus :) Ps.

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>My dog was severely ill on the 4th of July; by the morning of the 5th we were certain she wouldn't live much longer, she is only 7 months old. I made several calls to different vet offices and the soonest anyone would get her in was July 26th and I knew should wouldn't live that long. I called Care At the Courtyard as a last ditch effort, assuming they would not be able to see her just like everyone else. Amazingly they were able to get us an appointment in 30 minutes! The Vet was very empathetic and thoroughly explained her plan of care and why she was recommending each test. In the end, we agreed to the plan of care and 2 days later, our dog is up and running around acting like her normal puppy self. We reviewed the charges for the visit and all charges were similar to charges we had received at our regular vet, nothing was outrageous considering all factors. We are going to be moving all our dogs care here, the service is that amazing.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1541531988390, 'text': 'Deanne, we are so happy all is going great.

<Text>I have 3 cats and two dogs, all rescue animals.  The staff at Care at the Courtyard has always been like a family to me when it comes to my pets.  Early on in my first visits there my cat Smokey was diagnosed with injection site sarcoma.  She was my only pet at the time and I was devastated with this diagnosis.  The staff especially Dr. Holly Sawyer and Dr.Barbara Johnson showed Smokey and myself so much compassion and caring, that even though I was devastated by my loss, their positive attitudes and their state of the art treatments, allowed me and Smokey to have six extra months before her time ended.  All my current pets who range in age from 6 years old to a year old are in excellent health due to the staff at Care at the Courtyard.  Thank you to Dr. Johnson, Dr. Sawyer, and Dr. Peterson.  Love you guys.< /Text><UserId.>115860774711640040993</UserId.></record>

I live in Porterville and my chihuahua was attacked by coyotes, not one vet clinic in Porterville would let him come in without an appointment. Thank you Care at the Courtyard for taking him in (promptly) and fixing him up! I also appreciated the follow up in between visits. Thanks again!!< /Review>

< Review>
I don’t what to do next. I have used Care at the Courtyard since it opened and Diamond Vet before that (50 years). I love and respect most everyone there, but Monday, August 22 I called about 10:30 am requesting that a special canned food be ready and I would pick it up in about an hour.  When I got there at 11:30 there were three girls working the front counter. Two were taking histories and setting up files and the third was on the phone. I stood there and not one person looked up or nodded or acknowledged I was there. I stood there for 10 to 15 minutes and finally the one got off the phone and still did not offer to help. I had to get back to work so I left.

When I got back to work I called to re-order the food and not wanting to deal with any of those three girls I ask who sat at the other end of the counter and I think she said Savannah or Samantha. I asked to speak to her.  It took quite a while for her to answer the phone. I told her that I wanted to order my food and ask how much it would be and could it be up front and I’ll have a check or cash ready when I come to pick it up. She said, “When you come in you have to wait your turn if there are other people ahead of you”.  I then said, “I realize that, but clients should be acknowledged that they are there and not waiting in vain”.

At 4:00 pm I went by to pick up my food and when I walked in I had cash in hand. I told her I was here to pick up my food. She went in the back and came out with a torn open cardboard box with half the cans taken out and dropped it on the counter with quite a thud. I took it and left cash on counter.

Now I don’t what to do.  My little dog Bitsy is really sick and so far I’ve seen Dr. Sonja twice and Tulare/Kings ER once. I feel that because of the way I was treated that now I no longer can have services there and I don’t know where to go with my little sick Bitsy or Rosie, Baby, Thomas, and Jasper.</Review>

<text>Dr. Krumheuer and Dr. Chris Peterson are just the best Vets in town.  THey have taken care of my 19 year cat, Katy for about 10 years of her life.  As her health started declining with Hypothyrodism, Kidney Failure and a few other things....they did whatever they humanly, possibly could to give me about 2 more years of life with her.  Once I had to send her to heaven, Dr. Krumheuer made sure she was going to be there for me.  She helped me get through an extremely difficult time.  I miss her so very much, but she gave me 19 years of joy and has now sent me two new baby boys, 3 months old, Ikaika and Kei'lani and the the same Vet's at Care are taking care of my new furkids.   I just love the staff and the Vet's at this facility.  They are caring and compassionate.  Thank you for all you did for my little Katy.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1511112552659, 'text': 'While all our Vets are outstanding, I must admit that Dr. Krumheuer and Dr. Chris Peterson are very special.

I took my Pitbull puppy of 9 weeks to the Courtyard Clinic because after receiving her from the SPCA she had a dry cough. They checked my dog thoroughly and introduced to a medicine that will protect her from fleas and all kinds of worms. it replaces Front Line and Heartgard and costs less.

They said they will keep me up to date on her needed vaccinations and help me to keep her healthy. This is important to my wife and I because we just lost our Doberman due to cancer. This clinic was highly recommended by our emergency vet who is a friend. They have a very friendly staff.

Before we came to Courtyard we were at another clinic and were dissatisified with the service as well as the attitutude towards us as people. By chance we called Courtyard and made an appt. and was very impressed with the service, the personnel, as well as a very nice facility. we feel that we not only get good care but that the courtyard cares as well. They are a 5 star professional business and I would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone.

Care at the Courtyard is a class act. All the staff, front desk and back of the house are all very friendly and most of all very professional. Cannot imagine there is a better veterinarian clinic in Visalia. Total recommendation to anyone from me.< /review>

Such a chill place, welcoming and friendly. You will laugh at some point, either via your barber or another.
Mike was my barber and he was very attentive to the cut, giving me the best cut I've had in so many years.
I will for sure be back.</review>

The barbers here work hard and treat you with respect. The professionalism here is superb. Favorite barbershop in town. Mike and his team work well with one another, work hard together, take pride in their work and know how to treat their customers. After my haircut I always leave their establishment feeling confident and satisfied. Come here for your haircut, you won't be disappointed.<//text>

One of the best barbershops I have ever been to. Clean and welcoming, and awesome barbers and great cuts. You have to set an appointment which is cool so you don't have to keep waiting. My older brother has been cutting his hair for awhile and I have been cutting my hair here since then too cuz I always see my bro looking fly so I gave it a try. Mike is one of the coolest barber, he is our barber, he is welcoming, friendly, and does a wonderful job. He also gives you a hot towel in your face which is nice making you feel relax. I really recommend going to this barbershop so give it a try and see it for yourself..great customer service..it's a thumbs up!!<//text>

<Text>I been going to Mike for 3 years now. I got to say that he never disappoint. That goes for everybody else that works there. I always feel like a new and improved guy every time I leave there. The shop is real nice everybody in there is really friendly.

I took my 8 year old son in to get a haircut with a design shaved in. Mike was very inviting and good with my son. My son was comfortable and felt special as Mike checked in with him along the way. My son loves his new cut. The prices are very reasonable. Definitely would recommend Hyecuts!< /Review>

<Review>After asking around Sacramento State for the best barbershop I can go to, all fingers pointed towards Mikes barbershop and I cannot lie, this place is LEGIT. If you want a friendly atmosphere with barbers who actually put time and effort in your haircut, this is the place!

One of the best barbershops in Sacramento, period. I’ve been getting my haircut by mike for 5 years and he has always been consistent and professional. People are constantly asking where I get my hair cut and my simple response is always “by the best” five stars.< /Text>

Top of the line hair cuts. Mike is awesome ,he bought gents and wanted his own brand and man did he succeed . Changed the name, gives sodas waters, doughnuts and other things to clients just for coming in. Deserves every review it has got. Every chair seems to give quality cuts. It's nice knowing I don't have to worry about a bad cut here, ever! Family friendly, professional, comfortable, nice atmosphere , and quality. Can't ask much more from a barbershop! Highly< /text>

Man every time I go to this place my wife and I are always greeted by everyone as soon as we walk through the door! I've never had one bad experience with any of the barbers that work there wether it's Mike, Lo, or any of the other guys. Always amazing hair cuts for a cheap price, I've been going ever since they've opened and as long as I stay in the general area I don't think I'll be going anywhere else, keep up the great work guys!</text>

Mike and his barbers are masters of their craft, I've never seen a bad cut walk out of here. I've been getting cuts from Mike for years and won't go to anyone else. I drive almost 20 miles just to enjoy his amazing skills and the relaxing atmosphere of his shop. Not too many places provide a hot towel any more.

The quality of his cut, beard trim and line up are impeccable. I always get compliments after every cut!

They do take walk-ins but I definitely recommend making an appointment. These guys are popular due to their extremely good quality and usually packed with appointments, so if you don't have one expect to wait.< /review>

This man Mike has the greatest cuts I've ever had, went with my homie 4 years ago haven't been to another barber since. Everybody in the shop is chill and they all make you feel welcome, not a single problem in 4 years with mike and he works with the best. Great barbershop. Great barbers. 10/5 stars. If you need a sick cut come to the boys over at HyeCuts!</Text>

<Text>Mike is a great barber I've been going to since his previous location. Always super easy to reach and get an appointment with and really delivers in the service category. I have rarely followed Barbers when they move outside of the area near my home but it's been worth it. Always keeps you with a clean cut and good conversation what else can you want?< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

This place is legit! Best haircut I've had so far! Both Lo and Mike have cut my hair here and was happy with both. They do tend to book up, so it's best to make an appointment. Glad I found this place, and I won't go anywhere else!</Text>

Man this place is the best haircut around. I been going to Mike (owner) ever since I moved to Sacramento. I been to other barbers, but they could not compare, to the point  the 20 minute drive is worth it. Every one in there seem good an skilled at their profession.</review>

I have been going to Mike for over 3 years now and this is by far the most trusted Barber Shop I will go to. I've been to SuperCuts, Trend Cuts, Sports Clips, and many others. Ever since my first visit with Mike i don't think I can ever find a comparison in the quality that he brings with the passion of the cut. The shop is always clean and the fellow staff are excellent as well!! Until Mike retires I am a long time customer.</Review>

Since moving to Sac it was hard to find a true barber. None of those phony ones. Mike has been cutting my hair for 2yrs. People always complement my haircut, which is a result of Mikes work. If you need a fresh cut, you go to Mike.</text>

<review>Mike (the owner) is the guy who cuts my hair, however I'd trust any of the guys in the shop to do a speciality cut. The shop is clean and friendly. Lots of good "shop talk". I can't recommend this place enough. I came from a shop in Elk Grove and will never go back. Price is good and service even better. 5+ stars< /review>< pics>

I have been going to Mike at Hyecuts for about 6 months now. His skills as a barber are what keep me coming back. It is best to get an appointment, which is easy to do so. He is always on time and I never find myself waiting to get in the chair.  Drinks are cold and the hair cuts are on point. The skilled barbers at Hyecuts is what other barbershops downtown are missing.<//text>

I took my husband and son there with an appointment... They didn't take them in until. About an hr later mean while we listened to one of the barber's who was expressing himself very bad about ladies and kept apologizing to the two other ladies waiting in the shop. Sorry but it didn't seem very professional with that attitude.<//Review>

I saw a guy at the grocery store that had a clean beard fade and hair fade. He said this was the barbershop. I got a cut by Mike the owner  & it came out VERY WELL I recommend him to anyone as he is very reasonable and hospitable.< /text>

*UPDATE for new business name*

Formerly Gents Barbershop of West Sacramento Hye Cuts Barbershop is a brand revitalization by the owner Mike, that brings to you a mixture of his Armenian heritage in the name 'Hye'. Along with his love of keeping patrons crispy, with a nice clean cut and or shave.

Tucked away within the plaza, this barbershop is surrounded by a mixture of businesses. But it's bustling with people outside. As you walk up to the fron entrance you'll notice the logo on the front of the door and you can't see inside as all of the windows is tinted. Once inside you'll notice the tint helps to cut down on the bright light from outside and to minimize heat on warmer days. But it makes for a nice feel inside.

When you walk in you're greeted by a nice bachelor pad type of vibe. Brick colored walls, brown hardwood floor, nice lighting, black leather couches and barber chairs make the shops atmosphere. And you're greeted by the barber's which is nice, as some shops you walk into act like you're not there; even if you're gonna be cut by them. As soon as my Mike (the owner) sees me, he'll come over and say hi, and greet my girlfriend and our boys if they're there with me.

Mike and the other barbers are always hooking their clients up with clean haircuts that show an attention to detail. With my cuts Mike always goes the extra mile with my hair and beard, and will will occasionally ask if I want a little bit of eyebrow clean up with the straight razor. That's one thing I like about going to Hye Cuts, the hot towel and straight razor treatment is the icing on the cake for a fresh haircut. And a lot of places just don't give you that treatment!

Overall: If you're in the area looking for a nice shop, that will give you a clean cut with a good internal environment. Then definitely check out this place!</review>

I'm from Florida (Miami, Ft. Lauderdale and Tampa). I've been to Hella (I adopted this NorCal expression) barbers in my life. So I'm use to high standard Cuts (like many of you all)  It took me a long time to find a barber. And Hye Cuts barber shop has been amazing. My boy Armando (Mando) is one of the best barbers in Sacramento! And Mike (the owner) has only showed love since I've been coming here. I appreciate everybody here. So if you want a fresh haircut. Come out to hye Cuts for a good cut and an awesome experience! Dale!!< /text>

<rating>5</rating><review>In short: Asada fries are well priced and loaded with toppings. Way more then you get at most places! Recommend them for sure. Excellent Customer Service, very friendly.

In length:
Seeing mixed reviews on this place but I've been here twice for their Asada fries and they are really good and for the price they give you way more then 90% of other places. I eat asada fries from a lot of places and a lot of the time fries are over priced and really lack on the toppings. Not here though!! For under 9 bucks you get a lot of fries, meat, cheese etc...trust me fries that are this loaded for this price are hard to come by! Can't speak for the other food but recommend the asada fries and I'm sure the other fries are great too. The actual fries themselves are of better then most places as well and is actually my favorite part about this place. Most places use the same cheap fries that aren't seasoned well but these fries are full of flavor.< /review>< Pictures>

So... drove by this place this afternoon, didn't realize that they opened! Decided to try it out. The crazy fries and taquitos were absolutely delicious!! And the agua Piña, amazing!!! My new favorite place!! Thank you for taking the time to pay attention to detail in your food!! You can taste the care you put into it!! If you had a phone number on here, I would call you to you right now!! Keep it up, and my family and I will be back for sure!!<//text>

<text>So disappointed saw some good reviews and I was starving so thought I would give it a try and it was terrible the guacamole was bad made the tacos even worse than they already were literally stoped eating it half way through. Don't waste your money the best part of the meal were the peppers they give you on the side.</text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>I ordered food took it home and the  guacamole  that was on the food was bad  it was brown and old. I called them to notify them and either get a refund or new food without the guacamole  because im pregnant i cant risk that and  they said they couldnt do anything for me. Which is absolutely  ridiculous  i mean if you make a mistake its fine just own up to it but no he didnt wanna do anything to make the situation  correct< /Text>< pictures>

<text>(Translated by Google) If I could rate it as a zero I would. My food was literally done in 3min. I paid and went to go sit and right away we were served. The food was cold and looked as if it was taken out of a fridge. COLD !!!

If I could give it a zero I would give it to you. My meal was ready in 3 minutes. I paid for my food and when I went to sit and wait, they immediately gave me my food and it was super cold. It did not seem freshly made or even heated. Super cold. And the enchiladas were made from yellow cheese.

Si le pudiera dar un zero se los daria. Mi comida estuvo lista en 3 minutos. Pague mi comida y al irme a sentar a esperar, enseguida me dieron mi comida y estaba super fria. No paresia recien hecha ni siquiera calentada. Super fria. Y las enchiladas estaban hechas de queso amarillo.</text>< response>

(Translated by Google) The really lousy service is the arrogant one and I ordered a burrito and it is very cold and apart bad without flavor.

<resp>None<//resp><username>Michael Wiegenstein< /username><text>If you have a hard time with slopes? Best can definitely be a bit of a challenge. But it is good exercise for your dog. Again I would expect more from the city of San Marcos then you just put up a 4-foot fence around an unused part of the park? It would have actually been better had they put the dog park on the other side of the fence with all the trees and the bushes but that would have required some forethought or at least a little bit of paying attention? But this park is definitely not for people that have any kind of problem with walking!< /text><time>1616950726086</time>< gmapID>

We have a 15lb pug. We have come here at different times (weekday afternoons, weekend mornings) and there are hardly any other dogs there. If there are, they are almost always on the big dog side of the park (over 35lbs). The small dog side (under 35lbs) is almost always empty. We prefer Alga Norte dog park. Much nicer play area and WAY more dogs for our dog to play with.<//Text>

<Text>What I liked is that they sperate big dogs from small ones. other than that nothing special about it. just a piece of grass with fence around it. and it smelled like you're at a dog park - duh.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>Wonderful park, great location, friendly dogs and owners.
Pros: All grass, no rocks or mud
Cons: No shaded/covered sitting areas, mostly sloped, drinking faucets are outside the play areas(WTH???)<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>The dog park is built on an awkward slope which limits the area dogs can play and poses some danger to injury.

The grass is also not maintained so the majority of the dog park is rocky dirt.

It's a shame the park isn't better maintained as it leads most dog owners to seek out further away dog parks.</text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

I have been coming here for just over a year, while they do seem to close a little early but if you plan ahead this is the place! Beer is great but I always come for the insanely good salads!! Picture is worth a thousand words! Staff is friendly, service has always been fast. Love this place!<//Review>

Great food, simple menu. You won't get lost trying to find something delicious to eat here. The fries are consistently crispy and their burgers are simple yet full of fresh flavor. Prices are pretty fair for what you get and the portions of food are great. Friendly staff and a casual atmosphere make for a wonderful experience.< /review>

We have had issues with Madayne in the past, but the team is now very cohesive and friendly. The Greek salad is great and the chicken chipotle sandwich is AWESOME. Just the right amount of spicy. Fresh ingredients, fairly quick, and a little bit pricey but mostly worth it.</Text>

This is my go to destination after a trail run or a motorcycle ride, when I want good coffee or to show a friend how cool I am for knowing about this cool trendy place. I always get a wrap and tater tots with French fry sauce and coffee. I love these things so much, I can't bring myself to order something new/different. I would suggest trying the brownie because it is the chocolatey-est most gorgeous thing ever. But I won't, because I would hate for people to rush in, taking my advice, and get the last brownie before me. So avoid the brownie but try EVERYTHING else.<//review>

<Review>Swiss cheese and American cheese are two very different things. If their menus was correct I could have asked for it to be left off... instead I get to be sick from their food. Wish we would have just gone to subway like my boyfriend wanted. The cashier was extremely rude when I brought up the fact that their menu calls it Swiss and it isn’t.

<Review>Been here a hand full of times and the last two have pushed me to write a quick review. Which I seldom do... The staff here are very personable, and the food comes out quick. Moderately priced, plenty of seating, and a coffee bar as well. Young crowds and staff but staff impress me every time. I will be eating here more often.< /Review>< Pictures>

Food is great and the staff is always friendly. Not the biggest fan of the coffee. A lot of people love it but their blends seem to have a fruity note to it - not my favorite. I drink my coffee black so I can't cover it up with cream or sugar. I would recommend this place to everyone. I am picky with coffee so don't let my 3 stars steer you away! 5 star for service, 5 star for cleanliness, 4 for food, 2 for coffee, 3 for location (hilltop is busy).< /Text>

<Review>Just passing through Redding. Needed lunch and a quick visit to the Sundial Pedestrian Bridge.Numerous burger and sandwich choices.Excellent burger with their special dressing.Uncle Mike served our burgers AND gave clear directions to the Sundial.Recommend to travelers-location is just off I-5 and 229.Recommend. New owner. Got the pork rib sandwich. One of the best I've had. Fresh pickles, crisp fries. BBQ smoker out front. Good beers and wine. Nice stop driving through town in the 4th.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x54d2ed1c809d1c5b:0x7d3e35b27baedb33</gmapID></record>

The huge salads are a big draw here. I love the pecan chicken and I get it with an extra side of dressing because it is so big I always get a second meal out of it. The tater tots are great as well. If you want to try homeade ketchup they make their own so know that when you order your tots so you aren't suprised. Nice atmosphere with a small bar in the back. Nice coffee shop feel for working on your tablet/laptop for a few.< /Text>

<Text>Great staff and atmosphere! A Big variety of food, but not overwhelming. Trinami and the fries are excellent! Hot pastrami Is awesome if you like pickles and mustard. Try the sweet potato fries 😊👌< /Text>< Gmap_id>

<pictures>None<//pictures><Text>Always a fan of Madayne. Love their salads, sandwiches and pizza! Recently I tried a burger there for the first time. I think it's a new menu item from them. Word to the wise, stick with the soups and salads. One of the worst burgers and fries I've had. But overall, a great soup and salad, sandwich place. The Hilltop location isn't as roomy, but that location is a little nicer than the Eureka Way one. The staff have always been a pleasure!< /Text><Name>Cheston Stearns</Name></record></dataset><record>

<text>Some of the best sandwiches I've had in Redding are from madayne. If you haven't eaten here I highly suggest you check them out. Great place to grab a bite anytime during the day that they are open. I really like the French dip and the tri-tip sandwich<//text>< Response>

Nice decor!  Micro brew pub feel to decor.  food is yummy, slightly pricey.  We didn't drink <10am>but those that were looked like they had good full bar specuals.  I don't have much problem with price point but breakfast burrito was a bit small for the price.  Coffee was average,  The mocha tasted like they used Hershey syrup and it was too sweet.  The breakfast bagel sandwich..  again tasted good but bagel was on small side and it should have been toasted.  Seemed like bagel was warmed in a microwave<//Review>

There food is exceptional. I've eaten here a couple of times. Has more of an old bar kind of feel, like Frasier might walk out of the back at any minute. The food is well worth your time, and your palate will thank you.<//text>

<rate>4<//rate><text>Fun atmosphere with good food. The Trinami sandwich is the bomb dignity.
On the downside, the parking is not great and its a super expensive lunch for Redding.
For a sandwich, fries, and a soft drink (plus 15% tip), it was $18.50.
That's pretty up there for lunch. I think they would be busier if they had a few items that a person could in and out for around $10.<//text>< Pictures>

<text>Placed an online order for pick up on a Wenesday night. Ordered cheese burger w/fries & tri tip sandwich. IDK how this order was messed like this, but of course I didn't inspect everything before leaving, so I got screwed! First off the burger was dispose to have Amer. Cheese, none on the burger, as well as the pickles I had requested to be placed on it, none. I asked that ALL the condiments for ALL the sandwiches be placed on the side, due to the drive home I didn't want out burger soggy from the condiments. Not a difficult request but the sause that was left on the side, was not placed in our bag. Nether was the 2 sides of ranch and 2 sides of fry sause I has requested on the order, not to mention was clearly on my receipt as well. And to top it off they didn't even give my son his drink that should have came with his meal. At least when you online order it says a meal comes with drink and fries. I will comment on the tri tip, that was really good, even if I was missing the sause on the side. I am really bummed out this happened to our order because with my son doing sports like he does at Shasta High it would have been the perfect place to stop by and grab dinner to go a couple times a week. Maybe after they fill the to go orders and right when the customer is picking it up am employee should look the receipt over and confirm the entire order is in the bag, don't just assume that it is, because clearly as our order was that's not always the case.< /text>< resp>

Not worth it at all. $13 for a sandwich that has almost nothing in it and is NOT made with Swiss cheese. It was American which my girlfriend can’t eat. There will be a lot more stops on our road trip than intended now 💩🤦🏻‍♂️😡<//review>

Eh, food is ok flavor wise but skimpy for the money. Had a trinami, and welll... It was a much better sandwich when it was bricks. At this point, there are better places for the money.<//text>

First off the waitress was great. However the good was not so good. I requested my burger with no sauce and it came smothered in it. The lettus was brown in most spots so I scraped it off. The catchup for my fried was totally watered down and my casear salad was well there was no way in he!! I was going to eat it.the dressing was not fresh as they said and super sour. Will not be back. Wishing I could give -10.< /text>

<text>Pronounced Ma-Da-Yne. The food is delicious! Burgers, sandwiches, soups, salads and sides like tater tots and sweet potato fries. Casual dining, with an industrial/farmhouse flar. There is a coffee bar as well. Prices are similar to Red Robin.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

This is possibly the one of the finest establishments I’ve ever stepped foot on when it came to laundry services. I being an uncouthed baboon and obviously knowing nothing about laundry. Right away the manager Jacky came to my rescue and she suggested what settings too put for my wash load. And then crisis hit again and the coin machines had no coins they were out of service what was I to do. Jacky was there to save the day again. She used her key to set the time and did the math to calculate how much it would cost per dollar bill. If it wasn’t for Jacky it would of been a disastrous day. All and all my experience here was probably one of the highlights of my week. Thank you Jacky</text>

<text>The best Wash and Fold service ever. I was in a pinch, about to get on a plane for a last minute business trip, but my clothes were all dirty. One phone call in the morning and my dirty clothes were picked up, washed (well), on hangars, and returned that afternoon.

Super lovely Manager by the name of Jackie, came out to ask how I was and how I heard about the place, and then finally after years of using laundry mats explained what the difference in machines are! Great experience and super neat location with great food next door and a convenient store on the same block. If you gotta do laundry in San Diego, just make the trip down here and enjoy it at least.<//Text>

ln order to give my wife more free time over the weekend we started using this company to pick up and delivery our laundry. I am pleased to say that we are incredibly happy to have called Jackie and her company. She comes every Monday morning, picks up two bags of laundry and drops them off on Tuesday morning, cleaned,  folded and ready to wear. She is always on time and if she is going to be only 5 or 10 minutes late, she calls ahead. The price is very reasonable and I can only think that some of the extra cost is gained back by a lower water and electric  bill at the house and reduced maintenance costs for our washer and dryer. A definite win, win situation for us. I highly recommend using Jackie and her company.<//text>

Very clean place with great working efficient machines. Took no time at all to wash and dry our laundry. Great location which was a big deal for us. When we walked in there was already a man going around cleaning of crevice of every space, checking machines etc. Also there are about four change machines to get your quarters. Extremely friendly and helpful staff! Will be coming here from now on for our laundry services!</review>

<name>Stephanie Krahenbuhl<//name><Date>1549762336656<//Date><rating>1</rating><Review>I'm not sure where the 5 star reviews are coming from but not me. I just moved to the area and needed to do laundry and this was the closest one to me and had good reviews. First impressions we're ok. It has a cool change machine that took my $20 and gave me 3 $5's and $5 in quarters. Loaded up 2 machines, started them with a 30 minute wash. One of them made funny noises through the whole cycle and they took more like 45+ minutes to wash. The machine making all the noises left my clothes sopping wet. Then the dryers only work at half heat. These same dryers we're at my old laundromat and worked well getting really hot. These on high get lukewarm. So I spent more time and more money at this laundromat with a bad experience. I will gladly spend the money to go to another laundromat next time as I already spent it here because of poorly working machines.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>
{'time': 1549804088601, 'text': 'Hello, Stephanie,  This is Jacquie, the Manager of Crosby Square Coin Laundry.  I want to apologize and offer an explanation as to what happened when you did you wash at our laundry.  We have some high efficiency, low water washers, that are designed for light clothes and fabrics only.  There are signs posted indicating that these white front-load washers are not designed for materials that absorb a lot of water; such as jeans, sweatshirts, sweaters, towels, jackets, pillows, blankets, sleeping bags, etc.  These items become heavy when wet & the white front-load washers are not designed to spin the heavier loads.  That is why your laundry came out wet, why the machine made noises & why it took longer to do your wash.  We do have silver machines designed to handle these heavier loads & you would have been very happy with the results if you had used the silver machines (same price).  Our dryers get so hot, that you cannot even leave your hand on the window when they are operating without feeling burned.  I suspect that the reason it took longer for your laundry to dry was because the clothes were soaking wet, after not being properly spinned in the washer.  I would like to invite you back to Crosby Square Coin Laundry for a free wash in one of our silver washers and a free dry.  I believe you will have a 5-Star experience as so many of our customers share in their reviews.  Just call me when you come in (if I am not there), and I will make sure our attendants give you a free wash & dry.  Thank you.  Jacquie  619-764-5727'}<//resp>

Jackie and her crew are fantastic! I live in a location where laundry is very expensive and inconvenient. They take care of everything, work with my schedule, and are more affordable than the local mat. Highly recommend!</text>

<text>There was a swarm (8 or so) of flies at front door inside. Not a good first impression. Its in a totally ghetto, smoggy area (530pm.) Homeless people everywhere walking outside. Not worth the hassle and somewhat difficult parking.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1534176839763, 'text': 'Thank you, Christopher D., for your review & observation of Crosby Square Coin Laundry.  Since your review we have increased our vigilance in keeping the laundry even cleaner than before and no flies!  We are located next to a very popular Mexican bakery and customers often eat their pastries while doing laundry.  Sometimes sugar falls on the floor or in the trash containers when the bakery papers & leftovers are thrown away.  We now wash the floor 3-4 times a day or on an as-needed basis.  We pour bleach in the trash containers & wipe them with bleach every few hours or on an as-needed basis.  If you are willing to give us another chance, I believe you will be very satisfied with the cleanliness of the laundry.  Regarding homeless people, we enforce two rules in the laundry:  the people must be paying customers & they must behave themselves.  We cannot control where people live.  We also have some customers that are millionaires from Coronado & visitors from all over the world.  Our customers come from all different backgrounds.  We do our best to provide a high quality service at an affordable price.  Also, there is additional parking behind the laundry off the alley.  Should you wish to talk to me personally, feel free to call me at (619) 764-5727.  Thank you again, Christopher D., for taking the time to give Crosby Square Coin Laundry your review.

{'time': 1571057937420, 'text': 'Hi Elias,  While it is true that one of our change machines was down, we have four change machines available for our customers.  That means three of our change machines were working fine, and still are.  Also, we have two soap machines, full of all kinds of laundry supplies including bleach, fabric softener, detergent, laundry bags, dryer sheets, spot removers, etc.  Although the smaller of the two soap machines was down, the larger soap machine was full of products and fully operational.  I regret that the day you visited our laundromat that two machines were down.  However, whatever  you needed was still fully available, and considering we have about 65 machines altogether, having two or even four down at any given time, still leaves plenty of machines available for the customers.  Please call me for a free wash, so that we can give you a more pleasant experience at Crosby Square Coin Laundry.  I look forward to meeting you.  Thank you.  Jacquie,   858-205-3440'}<//Resp>

(Translated by Google) Great the owner, she helped me step by step to do the laundry. Come perfect. Among other things, compared to what I read, the area is in revaluation, nearby there are Mexican places and a clean Italian-style oven. Homeless around not harassing, cm in the rest of downtown

Grande la proprietaria, mi ha aiutato passo passo a fare il bucato. Venuto perfetto. Tra L altro rispetto a quanto leggo la zona è in rivalutazione, vicino ci sono locali messicani è un forno stile italiano puliti. Homeless in giro non molesti, cm nel resto di downtown< /Text>

You rent storage when you need it...and my need was great today.  It was refreshing  to be treated like a friend from the get go.  Professional, kind, empathetic...your manager exceeded my expectations.

I was headed to a different facility when your sign caught my eye.  Convenient location for my path of travel. Clean and well maintained facility...but what sold me was the personable service.<//text>

<Text>The manager here is AMAZING! I showed up just before closing and he was still willing and able to get me fully checked in without making me feel rushed. He made sure I was getting the best deals (even compared to their online promotions) and answered all of my questions - I called many times that day before officially checking in. I will always do business here.
Great price, great location, EXCELLENT customer service!<//Text>< Rate>

I have been so happy with StoragePro I can’t believe it. The office staff is always friendly and helpful with any questions I ever had. I had 2 units here but have been able to condense down to just one but I will be a customer here forever. I have rented many storage units in town for years and this has been the absolute best !! I have nothing negative to say here at all. Thanks Guys !!

I was charged $100 for a month that my stuff was not in the storage unit and when I tried to get a refund the women in the office gave me attitude and stated that it was my fault I didn't take it off auto. When I clearly told them when I was going to be out. I still have not received my refund.</Review>

<Review>I like the solid cinderblock construction of Storagepro at N. Highlands (which helps keep property and unit activities much cooler in summer).  Rents are very competitive and often with great intro. specials for popular size units.

The property is easy to drive to from Watt Ave. and is along speedy Roseville Rd.  Storagepro  has good access hours, security systems, and after hours security patrol.  With many size units to choose from, people can usually find the perfect size and good prices.

I've been in this same storage place for 20+ years and under different management companies, and by far this current one is the best!  They are friendly,  helpful and understanding of renter's situations and needs.  I would highly recommend both the property and management team, led by Marcel (he's the best!) here at Storagepro, N. Highlands.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

The staff was very friendly and made me feel like I was important by putting the phone call that came in when I was there an hold until another worker came in to get it.  Easy in and easy out.  Location is a bit hard due to the fact that you can only turn one way out of the parking lot but that's not their fault.< /review>

There absolutely amazing about a week ago I went to go bring some things to my storage and dropped them on and during the time my car with turned off when my door was open which cause the light to this day on my battery died and I couldn't start my car I use my cell phone to call the office and asked them if there was some way or someone that could please give me a jump because I was talk right by my storage unit the lady said yes actually ill bring my car around and give you a jump,   Although I do not have cable and I do not know how to jump a car  And I don't have cable but if you have the cables and you know how I'm on my way. In less than 2 minutes my car was jump started and I was back on the road. That acts of kindness And selflessness and the fact that she was more than willing to help me even though she didn't have to you and it wasn't in her job description at all nor did she app to allow me to use her personal car's battery to jumpstart mine. Thank you so much storage pro staff in North Highlands I will continue to rent from you and  I would most definitely refer this Storage property to anyone for the size the location and the quality of service and the security the rental price monthly is perfectly  Calculated as well as the rental insurance you really cannot move with this place there is absolutely no way you can have any complaints<//text>< Rate>

There's a camera right next to my unit as well and I wasn't even notified until it was well after the crime. I asked to look at footage and they expected me to narrow it down. Many of my valuable children's things were taken. All my boxes are gone, TV's, game consoles etc. They used to always call and just accept payments over the phone in w matter of seconds. Now they charge a $8 fee. The rent went up and with the frustration of all that happened a Ally has to just press my buttons on the phone. These people have no empathy, just doing their robotic jobs,. Might as well b replaced by a real one... I am very disappointed with this storage facility.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1563231003361, 'text': 'Hi Ali , We really appreciate you taking the time to leave a review.

I was very pleased with the service. It has been a couple of years since I was there and couldn't remember my password so I called the number provided and the lady who answered the phone was very helpful. I then was unable to find my unit and she wasn't able to help but was going to try to get my number. I went into my phone and was able to find an old bill with the number. She was very polite and friendly as well as helpful.<//Text>

< Review>
STAY AWAY - DO NOT RENT HERE AT ANY PRICE.  PAY MORE ELSEWHERE IF YOU HAVE TO, BUT DO NOT RENT HERE!

Here are just some of the problems.

They do not keep posted hours.  Doors are locked and nobody is there when they are supposed to be open.

People are rude and unresponsive.  IWeeks and weeks go by with no answer in spite of numerous inquiries.

Aisles are so narrow you can't get a truck down the middle.  I paid two hours extra labor to vacate my unit because the truck had to park so far away and men had to carry everything a long ways to the truck.

Worst of all, they refused to provide video after a theft.  I had more than $12,000 worth of stuff stolen out of my unit.  When I reported the theft and requested video,  they said they would provide it as soon as they had time.  I told them I knew who stole my stuff and just needed video to prove it for police to make an arrest.  After weeks and weeks of promising to provide video they got tired of me asking again, and then rudely told me, "You have to understand; we have a business to run.  We can't sit around all day watching video.  That is not our top priority.":  Now video has been written over and is no longer available.  I know who stole my stuff, and I know where he works.  If the bums at RV Storage Depot had provided video as they had promised they would, I could have gotten a judgement against the thief and could have gotten my money back by garnishing his wages.

These people are the worst!</Review>

I'm constantly trying to get ahold of them to pay my storage. They NEVER answer their phone. So I get hit with these late fees. The most unprofessional employees ever. I was a loyal customer for years. Untill these new owners came. Lost my business for life. They suck.<//review>

My g.f got me some menudo with hominy and it was really good. Pieces where meaty and not all mushy like at other places. Definitely recommend it.< /Text>

<Review>It was my first time trying it and I was impressed, your menudo is just so delicious. I loved the spicy sauce you give on the side just wish you had cilantro. But if you are looking for a great menudo don’t look no more try this extraordinary menudo. This is the spot!!!

Last time I went I spent around 30 dollars, and today I went to Amapola and spent only $10 for a full pot. I couldn’t believe it it!!  It’s about the same flavor but less expensive..</text>

<Text>The menudo is definitely tasty. The majority of the fat is taken out, the pieces of meat are bite size and not fatty and the red sauce added to it is not spicy. Unfortunately, the reason for the two stars is for the way the owner's son deals with clarification. The customer service was excellent up until we asked about the following. We purchased the same amount of menudo using the same pot three times. We were charged three different prices. When we inquired about the price of the Menudo we even suggested they have their prices posted on site to avoid misunderstandings. The owners son replied by saying the Menudo was of top quality, which we agree, but he added that if we couldn't afford it, he would understand. There was absolutely no need to make that remark. Instead of trying to figure out the reason for the three different charges, his statement was offensive.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

I finally came here and drove some miles with hopes of finding a new menudo spot... Let me start by saying that the staff here are amazing. Nice people with lot's of hospitality. With that said, the menudo... It was ok. It needed more flavor in my opinion. The portions were generous with plenty of tortillas and garnishes, but Mr. Menudo needs more flava.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) It is definitely a can. The pieces are dark in color. The landlord is clear. For 11 dlls I think they should respect the client. The glass is a good size, but they serve very little much juice.

Definitivamente es de lata. Los pedazos son de color oscuro. El casero es claro. Por 11 dlls creo que deberían de respetar al cliente. El vaso es de buen tamaño ,pero sirven muy poco mucho jugo.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) It often lacks a little flavor, the bits are often very small. In general it is very simple the broth lacks more flavor of lost a little epazote so that it has a little more flavor apart the price is $ 11 dollars and canned soda $ 1.50. Another point that the boy who charges has a very ugly attitude, hopefully and change his attitude with people. Thanks and good luck!!

al menudo le falta un poco de sabor, los pedacitos de menudo están muy chiquitos. en general esta muy simple el caldo le falta más sabor de perdida un poco de epazote para que tenga un poco más de sabor aparte el precio es de $11 dólares y las sodas de lata $1.50. Otro punto el muchacho que cobra tiene una actitud muy fea, ojalá y cambie su actitud con la gente. gracias y suerte!!<//text>

Good selection of cabinets for casual gamers and the backroom has plenty of setups for competitive players. Ideal for fighting game enthusiasts. The only thing that would make this place even more rad is if they served alcohol. Very spacious and cool merchandise.</Text>

Fantastic place. Owners are legends for bringing back arcades. The game Cabinets all work great and like someone else said, if there's a problem, the owner will fix it. Locals are always fun too! If you're hesitant to come to an event I can assure you that you will meet some great people and have some good games.< /review>

If you like fighting games or just arcades in general this play is well worth a visit. Plenty of parking! And plenty of space for console games!!!</Review>

By far the best Retro Arcade I have been to. It is easy to kill an hour or two playing the games. I myself can spend an hour or two on $5-10 which is incredibly cheap for this day and age. Besides classics we know they even have a couple rhythum games imported from Japan still running on their native software. What is nice is you can even book private parties for $225 for 4 hours. Not too shabby. It really is a diamond in the rough. One of the photos I added is of my high Score. If you visit soon enough you will see that ATA holds that high score and is tops of that one. Even if you do not like coin arcade games you can rent current gen consoles for use in the back room for game tournaments. There is nothing bad I can say the people working there are wonderful.<//text>

<Review>This is a really good arcade I love coming here whenever I have money. The reason why I really like it is because it's big slot of space and it's open late. and it's convenient to get too as in not hard to find its literally right down the street from the gold line train station. And throughout the week it doesn't start getting crowded unless they have tournaments going or it starts to get dark. But other than that I love this spot it's too bad they are shutting down tho smh 😔< /Review>< pics>

<Review>First time in town and was looking for some cheap fun. This arcade was great.   Gave each of my kids $10 and we were there for 1 1/2 hours.   Great pinball games.   Great games from the past. Even played a little Dance Dance revolution with the kids.  The young man working there was very friendly and helpful.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Review>Fantastic selection of classic games and there are a few rare Japanese gems tossed in that you can't find anywhere else. Pinball machines, too, an active tournament scene, and you can rent monitors/consoles by the day if you want. Five bucks will probably net you around 1.5-2 hours; it's great value for your money.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

This place has an excellent selection of retro games and fun game nights. Also, it's a LAN center. Around dusk this place fills up fast and it does get hot, but come early and you'll be king of this 8 bit castle. They have bathrooms, cold drunks and some stools to sit on. BONUS: I think they shut the power off of all the games every night so you're almost guaranteed to get on the high score board in whatever you play.</Review>

Cherry on top, they run fighting game tournaments in the back venue area almost daily & stream it all to Twitch, ask them what games run each day. I can't remember the full list, but it's everything from old-school Street Fighter II & III, Marvel series, and those Anime fighters - all the way to current generation Street Fighter V, AND Smash Bros ULTIMATE!

I like this arcade because it's close to home.  Most games are 25-50 cents, but there are a few that cost more.  Pinball games have their own room, and there's a large room in back with what I think are linked systems for tournaments.  Super Arcade has saved me several Metrolink trips to Pasadena.  Thanks!< /text>

Best classic arcade I've ever been to. Machines were well maintained. Everything worked perfectly. Their selection is impressive, including rare Japanese arcade games such as popn music and rhythm heaven. They have frickin gunblade! Also the greatest lineup of fighting games I've seen at an arcade with top notch sticks and buttons. Not to mention it's cheap! Most games are between 1 and 2 quarters.< /Review>

Thank you Super Arcade for existing!

You gave me Initial D and Maximum Tune competition in college, got me playing fighting games seriously, and now you are still relevant with multiple tournaments hosted and PINBALL.

I will continue to come for pinball practice and competition.

Pinball machines here are in various stages of repair.

Pinbot needs L-flipper worked on, Jurassic Park needs right flipper worked on, Plunger on Street Fighter is weak AF.</text>

Pretty cool spot to hang out at. They have pinball tournaments and smash Bros tournaments often. Lots of cools arcade games like marvel vs Capcom 2, Street fighter, metal slug, ms. Pacman and galaga. Come check it out $10 last me about 2-3 hours depending on the games.<//Text>

Games cost less then any other arcade place and the workers are very helpful and kind. The only thing I wish they had a air hockey.<//review>

Terribly long wait. Dropped off my mom to get a haircut after I was told it wouldn't be long because there was 1 guy getting cut already and 1 waiting. An hour later she had barely been started on by another stylist who got to the salon and cut or worked on the guy she had arrived with first. Why not just say it would be a long wait when I asked?? My mom has very short hair and is 84 and they charged her $20?? Men's cuts are $12 and take forever, or at least here. First and last time going there.< /text>

I once spent two breakfasts here and a lunch. The Blue Butterfly is like the coffee shop version of Cheers. You are bound to run into someone who knows your name. So grab an iced coffee, order anything on the menu, and let the neighborly magic take it from there.< /review>

I arrived on time for my online pickup order and waited 10 minutes before I was asked to be helped.. there was no sense of urgency at all. The vibe is neat, small and hip. I had the California Hash Avocado Toast and it's is good and would be amazing if it was fresh! Maybe don't go on a weekend if you want the best experience.< /review>< pics>

The food was good but service wasn't the best. First the Pickle Rick didn't come with the pickled tomatoes that their online menu says it comes with. So instead they give me sliced tomatoes after I pointed this out with staff. Because of the current climate we are in, we have to dine outside and not inside. Fine. But the takeout container my food was in makes it a pain in the a$$ to eat from. That's if you want to use utensils to cut the toast into bites. I didn't want to use my hands to eat because I didn't wash them and the toast was messy. Afterwards, I looked for the trash to throw my trash out, but they don't have a trash can so I had to walk away with it. I should have left it behind since I tipped them anyway for service, although it's very much self service at this point. I preferred the cafe a few shops down, Two Guns's smoked salmon avocado toast way better.</Review>

Amazing breakfast sandwich, outstanding coffee, and really kind attentive staff. The smoothie we had was also incredibly fresh. All around such a wonderful experience. We had breakfast here prior to our flight out of LAX and it made the rest of the day!<//Review>

OMG. I was looking for a place that had an oat milk dairy substitute. They have it. I accidentally ordered an iced chocolate espresso thing. It made me so happy. I’m coming back every day. I’m addicted. The avocado toast was also pretty fire<//Text>

Great service. Was disappointed that the only decaf was Americano (I love dark roast and have no need of the simulation from caffeine). However everything was very nice.< /text>

I have been coming to Blue Butterfly for years and am only just now getting to reviewing. I love this place so much! It is one of my favorite cafes in all of Los Angeles. The coffee here is phenomenal, I love the beans that they use and you can even purchase some to take home.

The location is perfect, smack dab in the middle of Downtown El Segundo, not too far from the beach and pretty easy to find parking all around.

Keep being awesome, Blue Butterfly!</review>

Always a little cramped inside, but consistently great coffee.   The ham and cheese quiche came out cold and mushy, but that’s the first mediocre item we’ve received so far.<//Text>

For the food - I love the chocolate chip banana coffee cake and the California St bagel sandwich. For lunch, the tuna melt is mouth watering good!

Not only are the food and drinks wonderful, but the staff are friendly and efficient. I LOVE coming here - it’s a pretty much weekly weekend necessity!</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Overall pretty good coffee. Don’t know if I came while the team was still figuring out the morning but pretty sure my food item was forgotten or given away by accident. Waiting about 10 minutes for my avocado toast. Then they tell me it’s gonna be another 10-15?
Again coffee was good, vibe felt nice. Just a little disorganized.< /Review>< Time>

Very nice. Chocolate croissant and oat milk latte were both just right. Small sidewalk seating area, cool and shaded in the morning but very limited shade in the afternoon.< /review>

Plenty of drink options and the food menu is a bit smaller but this cafe offers great choices.

I ordered an iced mocha, my go-to, and I wasn’t disappointed. I also ordered a cheese bagel that included tomato, cream cheese, avocado and bacon which was delicious. My boyfriend ordered an omelette that had steak, mushrooms, onions, spinach and cheese and he really enjoyed it.

All in all I think it’s a great place to eat. Parking is a little more difficult to find but if you’re in the area I recommend checking it out!< /Review>< response>

<Text>Okay. I had no idea this place existed.

Reminds me of the most perfect coffee shop. And they have incredible food.

Staff know their stuff. Leslie comes from a background of tea knowledge and it showed in the way she made the almond milk matcha lavender latte. Yes that is a thing.

We sat outside and felt the calm ambiance to enjoy our meal. We devoured the breakfast quesadilla, French toast and Gundo Scramble.

I've been remodeling my kitchen for the past few months and this is the closest thing I've come to eating something I would cook. Thank you.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPfSRLrNltfPbeju1-iaHejeoEFGoO0DL06DCSh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOYEw_sMd0GM5l4r7gyEsgwZbRIcPYtwniJGpWt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAhG4LG-6tcsd0978C3rWU4Z-1HGYZleza8ddz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

The staff is extremely friendly and the atmosphere inside the coffee shop is superb. If you're working remote, then you will find this perfect to set up shop for the day! I will be back!< /review>< response>

Although many people inside had disposable cups, I asked the cashier who helped me if they had anything reusable and he came back with a glass jar for my iced lavender matcha latte. (Earth win!) He subbed the whole milk for almond milk and it is was refreshing and delightful! I worked for two hours in a pleasant atmosphere and was very happy with my experience there. Many thanks, Blue Butterfly.<//Review>< Pics>

Employees are very friendly and the food and coffee are solid. The wifi is extremely spotty (at least it didn't work for us) and there are very few outlets (we only saw a pair of two under the counter on the side with the most seating).

A good place for food, coffee, and some atmosphere; not ideal if you want to work or study.</text>

Dang I felt old in here. Lol. Mainly young Hipster type folks in here. I felt very out of place. We were meeting someone here, so we figured to get a drink.

It's super loud and crowded inside. It was hard to get a table inside, or in front. But we were lucky to get a table out back. There were a few tables out there, open.

There was about 6 people in front of us, The line moved fast. Took a bit for The drinks, but for being super busy, the process was fairly quick.

One thing that bothered me was, while waiting, I watched the cashier go from taking money, to cutting someones bagel, to taking more money, to cutting a loaf of bread, and never once used gloves or washed her hands. This is how things spread!

I got a fruit soothie. It was pretty good. Sweet and sour. My hubby got a blended mocha. He liked it. Not Sure we would be back. Cute place for the younger crowd. (Gosh I feel old lol)<//text>

<Review>Stopped in for a cup of espresso on the way to LAX and I'm glad I did, because I needed a shot of ceffeine, stat! We got a latte, and ordered an Iced Lavender latte with Oatmilk.

They messed up the iced latte and gave us a matcha instead, they remade our drink and told us to keep the matcha and it turns out that was the favorite.

Try the Iced Lavender Matcha with Oatmilk, the matcha was creamy and flavorful, the lavender was subtle and sweet and the Oatmilk was deep and rich. The flavors complimented each other like dancers choreographed to a symphony.

The place seemed like a cool place to sit down and do some work although we only had a few moments to talk over in the patio. Not too busy, would definitely check out this place!<//Review>< Rate>

I'm not a reviewer that is stingy with his stars, nor do I throw them carelessly and irresponsibly at places to skew the honest opinions of customers.. When I award someone five stars, they've earned them. They've met the expectations of an establishment that does exactly what they're supposed to, exactly what they promise to, and exactly what I'll return to.

Blue Butterfly Coffee Co. was out of the way for my plans for the day, but I needed a spot to sit and do some work. When I arrived, I was sad to not see any open seats where I could set up camp and get my work done, so I just ordered a cortado and French toast and hopped up to the beautiful wooden bar.

I didn't watch them make my drink, too busy trying to watch everything else in this bustling shop. The super quiet Malkhonig conical grinder spat out its dose. Each dose is carefully spun with a grounds distributor, and then tamped with a mechanical tamp. They've spared no expense to get all the variables of espresso in line.. I couldn't discern what milk was used, but when I received my drink I didn't care much...this was one of the top three cortados I've had anywhere.. The only improvement would be to give the coffee in the glass a quick stir before topping with milk...

The French toast came sprinkled with powered sugar and a side of real, warm maple syrup.. Ahh, real maple syrup... Some of the best breakfast establishments I've been to still refuse to offer this natural condiment with their cakes and toasts, but this coffee shop gives more than I'd ever need. Such a relief..

Great French toast. Great cortado.. I think I'll have some tea next.</review>

The food was outstanding, however, the place is small and can't host people for sit down, plus there seems to be too few attendants to make the service go better and faster. Only one cashier at a time, and 2 cooks, and 2 making drinks, other 2 were doing general restaurant duties. They run out of straws and were not refilled for a while. My drink took forever to make, and our food was delayed. Could certainly user more personal and expand the location to accommodate more people.<//review>

I came to Blue Butterfly during my lunch break and it was decently busy. I was looking for a local coffee shop with pastries and Blue Butterfly fit the bill.

I got an medium iced latte which was good, but too milky for my taste. I like really tasting the coffee so the next time I come, I'd either add a shot to my drink or get something without milk. I also got an almond croissant which was super good and buttery when heated up. I want to try the chocolate croissant next time :)

They also have a good amount of whole beans for sale in bags. The roast dates are printed and from what I could tell, nothing was more than 1-2 weeks old. Fresh! If only there was more coffee in my latte!! If I liked the coffee, I definitely would have bought a bag of beans for home.< /text>

<review>This place is a little gem! The staff are always extremely friendly even when its busy. Their coffee is of great quality and the pastries are quite yummy. The only reason I have deducted a star is the store constantly being a bit messy. I've gone in a couple times later in the evening when its not busy and there's napkins and cup sleeves all over the floor. Not to mention the music is a bit loud for studying, but that could be a personal thing. Other than that I I always recommend this place and love coming here. Kudos to the team!<//review></record></dataset><record>

This place is awesome, the people are great and so are the staff. This is a warm cozy place you can plug your laptop in for charging and sip coffee and eat bagels or donuts all morning in! They open super early too! Parking in the front and back, I suggest the back if you're a regular or staying long!</Text>

Love the Cho Cho Son iced coffee. I got it with 6 shots and could barely taste the coffee because it's so smooth. Definately an over the top experience. The chicken sandwich was really tastey also.<//Review>

Love this place.  Go check out the secret outdoor seating all the way in the back past the restrooms.  I have done a lot of work and studying here.  The blueberry flavored coffee is my favorite!  The owner is really nice as well<//Review>

<text>Good coffee, but slow service. It took me about 10 minutes of waiting in line, then 20 minutes of waiting for my cappuccino. Other busy coffee shops manage to get simple coffee orders out quicker and have faster moving lines. Because of that, I won't come back here< /text>< user_name>

Always stop in for a coffee when I’m in the area. Good selection of coffee and tea related drinks and pastries/bagels. Service can be a tad slow occasionally, but it’s never too long and the coffee is worth it.<//Review>

Line wasn’t even long but it took forever to get our food. The staff seem to be having a great time chatting with each other, which made work go slow. Kudos to the guy with short hair at the cashier who seemed to be the only one doing anything. The food and coffee was eh okay nothing too special. Will not return.<//Text>

Took much too long..waited about an hour perhaps for my toast. They never brought the tea out so by the time I noticed it was at the counter, it was a bit cold. Good tasting tea and toast but didn't get it at the same time. Wouldn't go back on a Sunday. Maybe another day if it's not crowded.</review>

<text>For a place that serves fresh coffee and coffee drinks, as well as great pastries and breakfast items that has atmosphere and an awesome staff, look no further than The Blue Butterfly in downtown El Segundo. This place is PERFECT for relaxing, meeting friends, or grabbing a coffee and breakfast on-the-go. 5/5 - will probably be a regular soon.< /text><user_id>110848500991445276022< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Love this place. The blended coffee is like having a coffee and a milkshake. I had the peanut butter blended and it was awesome.

To eat I had a bagel with bacon, avocado and cream cheese. I normally don't like bagels, but this was something else....

Awesome place and I'm sad we don't have something like this in England.< /review>< pics>

Excellent espresso but uninviting/unwelcoming service. I saw that the espresso would be pulled into a paper cup and asked nicely for a for-here cup. I like the feel of a thick espresso cup, you know?  The cashier/barista responded lazily, as I were troubling her. Espresso was served in a water glass. No biggie, but a simple "we're out of espresso cups" would have sufficed.  The espresso was great.<//Review>

<text>If you want coffee, go to a family run shop. If you want good coffee, go to the place with the line holding the door open for each other to order theirs. This coffee is worth the line even before understanding the wait isn't long despite the length. It only will take 5 minutes to order, another 3-5 minutes to wait for the brew, and starts the day off great. You can watch them make everything too and it's reassuring seeing them not using flavor syrups or premade packages they just heat up. Don't go to Starbucks. Go here</text>< user_id>

I love this place. The best local coffee shop in El Segundo. The staff is incredibly friendly and you can tell they all work hard. The food is fresh and absolutely incredible. My favorite is the lox bagel sandwich. The coffee is very good and will serve you better than any Starbucks you ever visit. If you're looking for a nice, friendly, small-town atmosphere this is the place to go.</Review>

Blue Butterfly Coffee Co. fulfills my coffee snobbery with some excellent coffee. Their cold brew is delicious, they said it is typically a Mexican and Guatemalan blend, it starts off with a cedar and orange flavor, then upon the second sip the tangy, coffee fruit flavours come out. Delicious! I also had their Kenyan one day it they brew a good cup of coffee. I usually use a 1/16 ratio and their coffee is pretty darn close if not the same ratio. They also had a good Kenyan when I was there, served at a perfect temperature. They also have bags of beans for purchase if you do your own grinding and coffee.<//Review>

The food and drinks aren't cheap but it's well worth it. The place can be crowded at times but other than that, it makes for a great study area. There is seating inside, in front, and in a cute little patio in the rear. The workers are also really friendly. I recommend the iced lavender matcha and kale salad.< /text>

The morning manager is amazing. She Made our experience here quite enjoyable. She was very outgoing and able to cater to our needs without saying a word! We have a 5hr layover and instead of roaming about, we spent it here because of how delightful she was. She would even check in with us every so often to make sure we were ok. Most places don't even care. Truly loves her job and the people around her. Magnificent!<//text>

<time>1558027165087</time><rating>1</rating><Review>I was visiting California from Toronto, Canada and wanted to enjoy local coffee shops. We came to Blue Butterfly our first night in El Segundo and I ordered an iced latte with almond milk and my husband ordered a regular cappuccino. I’m not sure if it’s the lack of awareness from the baristas crafting the beverages, but my drink and my husbands drink both tasted like the espressos were either not calibrated, or that’s the regular taste of the espresso roast. It did not taste good at all, and the baristas behind the counter were having these conversations that couldn’t be paused to serve the line of customers. It was busy in the cafe, and I was surprised there was so many customers due to the loud music. I see that the store manager and or owner responds to the reviews, and I respect that highly. The service that I received was extremely poor, and would just like to bring it to the owners attention.< /Review>< pics>

This place and their workers are the nicest, kindest, and friendliest.  The musician playing on Thursday nights is awesome.  Thank you, 5 star Blue Butterfly, for saving us during the cold December rain.  We'll be sure to come back, tell others and drop a money bomb on this place.  Happy Holidays!< /text>

We are focusing our efforts on addressing and fixing the problematic areas that you have mentioned above. We are developing a more rigorous training program to ensure our Barista's are confident in what they are serving and we have hired new cooks with 10+ years experience.\nThank you for your feedback, though in the last few months we've had some struggles, I hope in the future you can give us another shot.\n\nThank you,\nKevin\nGeneral Manager"}<//resp><review>I can't believe how bad this place has become. I tried visiting this place 3 times over the last few months and each time the same things kept happening:  No nitro cold brew because of issues with delivery or the Nitro pressure; The staff can't find the almonds to make the almond smoothie; They don't write names on all the drinks you order and there isn't a space to really pickup the drinks so no one knows whose drink is whose and other people end up taking your drinks. Lately the only thing good about this place is the napkins. The way this place manages the kitchen is inefficient and everyone seems to be scrambling in every direction and it shows. The quality of the food has become increasingly worse and worse. My almond smoothie tastes like ice water. The mocha way too sugary. It took me 3 tries but finally I got fed up. I hope this review encourages them to make some changes. They definitely lost a couple customers I'm sad to say.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Okay. Definitely a chill environment. Good food. Good vibe. Staff was nice and focused. Now my main critique and may it be of use for this establishment and taken with a grain a salt.
The work stations and overally layout of those stations are crushing expediency. Coffee joints especially ones like this need to find a fine balance between hustle and chill.
Would definitely recommend when time is not of the essence.  Some simple changes would really cut down on wait times.
Thanks for the great cup of Joe and the scone.</text>

Coffee is delicious and pricing is fair, but there are several staff here who are glacially slow. Also, was served butter with the wrong bagel.

To be fair, there are a few employees who hustle and focus, but they’re outnumbered at a ratio of 5-1 in a single shift.</Review>

From out of town, was so excited to visit after perusing the online menu & reviews. Service wasn't good though. My to-go order had been sitting out for awhile even after I had inquired about it. Instructions on retrieving beverages weren't clear either. Not sure if they were having an off day but they seemed to be out of sorts. Avocado toast was too expensive but chai was great. Might try it again. Might not.</review>

Match latte was not too sweet and loaded with Matcha.  It's a little small and it's definitely hard to find a seat when it gets busy.  The front and back patio are perfect for sunny Los Angeles days. Overall this place is great and I'd recommended it if your looking for great coffee and in a good atmosphere.<//Text>

Extremely friendly staff, especially for the time of the morning I went (around 6am) with lots of helpful suggestions and recommendations based on my personal likes and dislikes.

I was recommended, and eventually tried, one of their tea drinks called the London Fog, and it was just what I needed to wake me up.

Highly recommend!< /text>

Busy and relaxing place to eat breakfast. There is a nice backdoor area with bushes and small garden. Overall, the place has a chill vibe. The pricing is medium-high, but that should be no deterrent to visiting this relaxing location.<//Text>

You can do better, Blue Butterfly.

I like going to this place in person.

However, today I used Grub Hub for delivery.  I selected the Iced Matcha Lattee and was surprised when it arrived hot. We called Blue Butterfly to clear up the confusion and a rude counter person told me 1) it happens often and 2) I shouldn't bother calling the store because it was a Grub Hub error.  She said Grub Hub uses a picture of an iced matcha when the drink is actually served hot.  When I asked why the store didn't contact Grub Hub to have the picture fixed, the counter person told me she was too busy and that I should call for her.

Call me crazy, but I think customer service is YOUR job, counter person. If the error happens often, you MIGHT want to get it fixed.

You can do better, Blue Butterfly.< /Text>

You’re right we can definitely do better.\nI actually remember making your order personally this afternoon. I apologize that the order was not made the way you wanted it.\n\nWe are happy to offer you a refund. Grubhub does not allow us to issue refunds through our end so in order to receive a refund for your order you can call them.\n\nHowever, we are happy to offer you a free Iced Matcha Tea Latte on us for your next visit since I know their policy is an inconvenience. Just show the barista this message and they will be happy to help.\n\nI hope the rest of your order met your expectations and our standards and that you can give us another shot.'}<//resp>

Good coffee, local vibe, solid food quality.  I'm local so sometimes after dropping off kids at school I'd come here for morning coffee, then sometimes meet up friends in the afternoon.  The crowds are very different at different hours and I like that - because the place can attractive various personalities.  Occasionally in the busy morning hours, the staff can be visibly stressed or irritated, it doesn't happen often, but when it happens, you notice and it affects you.</review>

<date>1513099268652<//date><Text>Nice little cafe nestled into a revived part of El Segundo. This might be my new "after a flight" stop for a quick bite and coffee. The staff was extremely friendly and offered several suggestions. I had the turkey panini and it was excellent. My cappuccino was ok, I felt like their coffee was middle of the road. Better than Starbucks, but not competing with some of the stronger coffee shops around. There are a few (tight) parking spaces in the back. Overall I enjoyed my restful, post-flight stop here.< /Text>< Rating>

They totally forgot all of our sides and our kids French toast I'm so annoyed I will never go back. When I tried to call the line was busy for over an hour I never got through.< /text>< Rating>

Staff is super friendly and patient, good coffee, awesome bagels, and the roasted veggie sandwich was great! Perfect stop to read or do some work with nice coffee and impressive art.</Review>

I always want to like it and it's a cute place for coffee, but lines are generally long bc the staff isn't managing it well and often times your order gets lost or forgotten about so you are there 15minites to get ice tea poured from a large container into a cup...</Review>

The Lavender Matcha was delicious! This is by far one of the best Matcha drinks I've ever had, not too sweet and nicely balanced with the Lavender flavor. Definitely recommend.<//text>

<Text>Best coffee shop in the area. Not over priced coffee or food like other hipster cafes. If you go try the fruit smoothie, it’s exceptional. Good vibes, good playlist, causal and not pretentious. 9.5/10 only because the WiFi is limited to an hour - however you sometimes can connect to another open network.< /Text><user_name>Kiddee Charoenpanitkul< /user_name><Date>1521855461480</Date><rating>5<//rating>< Resp>

I've been here only twice now and I like the place - but even this second time around I am hearing a song on their playlist "Screwed", I'll leave the lyrics for you to look up, last sentence though is: "Wanna get screwed like an animal", and while that might what Janelle Monáe would like to happen to her, does Blue Butterfly not realize there is a high school right across the street? There were a bunch of highschoolers in here last night when I first visited. While I am all for the liberality of letting people screw their brains out, I am not for playing songs about it to kids.

Other than that, staff is friendly and tea is decent and at a reasonable cost. Nice little vibe and good name for the cafe. I do appreciate that they don't play a constant supply of 20's and 30's music like Starbucks does, perhaps they could play music in between super-oldie and songs dropping the F'bomb several times talking about getting screwed all over the place; I'd give them a couple more stars for that.<//text>

Just moved to town.
Wanted to love it here but the store needs help with The Tech.
Cash out at the POS is slow and laborious creating looonnnng lines and wait times.
Big One - Internet is dial-up slow or non-existant. Both issues probably related.
Wish I could give a free tech consult to streamline operations and get the cafe up to speed, otherwise it's gonna have to be finding another place to frequent.
Update:
Internet is terrible everywhere in LA. Upping rating from 2 to 4 stars.<//Text>

This was hands down the best breakfast and coffee I have had in the US. I love a good vibe and this place had one of the best.

I’ve been coming here for years, but I won’t be going back. The coffee is great and they have some good food options, but customer service has declined to the point where it’s not worth it.< /Review>

Locals to El Segundo know this place well.  It is the best coffee place in town.  In the morning there is lines, but the brewed coffee makes up for it.  They even have homemade concoction that is a specially brewed cold coffee.</review>

Blue Butterfly is a fun and unique coffee shop. The atmosphere is laid back and relaxing and the staff and fellow customers are neighborly. The prices are a little high but they have unique choices like the delicious lavender matcha or the guinness-like nitro coffee. Worth a visit. Try going on a Thursday afternoon to hit up the farmers market that is set up on the street just outside.</Review>

< Review>
I liked the atmosphere of this place, and their coffee was good as well, but be warned they don't have wi-fi until after 2pm because they want people to flow through faster in the morning. Can't blame them wanting higher turnover and more money, but for a customer it leave a 'meh' kind of taste in my mouth. Good for a meeting and studying (with books), not good for working.<//Review>

< Review>
Cute little coffee shop with authentic charm. I tried the frozen raspberry chai when I went. The staff was kind and overall I enjoyed the shop.

The downside is that I do not think the shop has wi-fi, which meant I couldn't stay long to work on anything. I could be wrong, but it was not there when I went.<//Review>

Our wait times are much quicker than that usually maxing out at 5-  10 minutes.\n\nJust reference this message when ordering and our barista will be happy to come you in your next visit.\n\nThank you for visiting,\n\n- Kevin'}< /Response>

{'time': 1492495178008, 'text': "Hi Mary... So sorry you didn't have a great experience at our shop.    We do run low on pastries in the afternoon as we are small store.  I'm not sure when you visited us but if you come in the early morning I promise you a large selection of tasty pastries.  We also have a very large menu of drinks as well as a pretty big  kitchen menu that serves breakfast and lunch till 3.  We hope we get the chance to have you back and I'm sorry we didn't meet your expectations.\n\nCheers\nDale\nOwner of Blue Butterfly Coffee"}<//response>

(Translated by Google) Many coffee shops in Los Angeles are fashionable and delicious! Among them, this coffee shop in the area of ​​El Segundo is one of my favorites. It seems that the whole area here is quiet and calm.

Cairate is relieved by the scent of chai spices. The bakeries such as bagels lined up in the store are all wonderful.

I think there is no problem because the parking lot has many street parking nearby. However, in terms of equipment, even though there is a power supply, free Wi-Fi can only be used for 60 minutes, so it is not suitable for long-term work.
This is the best place to relax and enjoy a coffee break!

ロサンゼルスのコーヒーショップはおしゃれで美味しいお店が多い！そんな中でもエルセグンドという地域にあるこのコーヒショップは私のお気に入りの一つです。ここの地域一帯が静かで落ち着いた時間が流れているようです。

チャイラテはチャイのスパイスの香りがホッとします。店内に並ぶベーグルなどのベーカリー類も素晴らしいものばかりです。

駐車場は近くの路上パーキングがたくさんあるので、問題ないと思います。ただ、設備でいうと、電源があるのに無料のWi-Fiが60分しか使えないので、長時間の作業には向きません。
ゆったりとコーヒーブレイクを楽しむには最高のお店です！</text>

(Translated by Google) Outstanding café! Had breakfast there several times (really delicious omelette) and great coffee. The staff are super nice and funny. Great ambience. Anyone who lands in LAX should then have breakfast directly at Blue Butterfly.

Hervorragendes Café! Hatte dort mehrmals Frühstück (richtig leckeres Omelette) und tollen Kaffee. Die Angestellten sind super nett und witzig. Tolles Ambiente. Wer in LAX landet, sollte danach direkt bei Blue Butterfly frühstücken.</Review>

{'time': 1498291407779, 'text': "Hi... So sorry you felt like we deserved one star. We must have done something really horrible and  I would love to have you tell us wha,t so we can try to correct it, and if there is any way we can make it up to you.  If there is a problem with staff or our product, I would love to fix it.\n\nTo just put out one star with no reason doesn't help.  As you can see we have more 5 star reviews then anything, and we strive for a fantastic experience and to get it right every time.  When I see one star without a reason I can't do anything to make sure it doesn't happen again.  Please help me make it right rather then just a random one star.\n\nThank you so much\n\nDale\nOwner"}<//resp>

Would love to hear what you think would help us "star up".   As you can see we have a lot of 5 stars and want to strive to make that our norm.  If you get a chance would love to hear back and find a way to make sure we meet  your 5 star expectations if we can.'}< /Resp>< gmapID>
