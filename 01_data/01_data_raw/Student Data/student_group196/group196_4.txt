<response>None<//response><Text>I love Sprouts I normally go to the one on Capitol. I went to this one a couple time since its near my job but I just feel consistently watched. It's unfortunate, I don't usually have this issue. It feels like I'm being discriminated just by skin tone. I honestly, just go to Safeway on my breaks the staff there are always friendly. It's a shame I really like Sprouts.</Text>< GmapID>

The supply of vegetables is good, though, so you're reasonably likely to get what you're looking for. The chicken goes on sale periodically (announced in the flyers) and is a great bargain. The spices sold here are good. Wouldn't recommend it for dairy products, you can get better prices elsewhere.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Always good. Produce is generally ripe and good to go. I like the herbal section as well.

I guess I would call it a poor man's Whole Foods, but that is selling it a bit short. About the only problem, that I see, is the lake that happens when it rains. :-)</text>

I took my mother to Sprouts on 4/30/2021 around 3pm. She is elderly, so I bagged her groceries and paid with her credit card.  I paid separately for my bulgar wheat.  I told the cashier, "sorry" because I handed him a 20 dollar bill. (Why charge one item?)  Anyway, he gave me change back as if I paid with a $10 bill.  I looked at him and said, "I gave you a twenty!"  I know I gave him a twenty because I did not have any tens, having just gone out to lunch and paid tip with $1 bills.
He looked at me and with a flat expression said, "What would you like me to do?"  I could tell then, that it was going to be a losing battle, my word against his.  He was rather heavy set.  I am telling every one I know to not patronize that place.  My mom lives in Los Altos and we will shop at Safeway from now on.  I am so upset.<//Text>

<Review>Consistently awful, unhelpful customer service at the check out lines and at the sandwich counter, which is a shame with the store having such good prices. Only nice person was a younger Hispanic woman on register a few months ago.

One of my favorite supermarket. Their vegetables and fruits often have unbelievable deals and they are good quality. Overall good selection of produce. One star deducted because sometimes their meat is not as fresh as Trader Joe’s or Whole Foods and the selection of snacks is limited.< /Text>

Probably one of the best places to buy fruits and vegetables in the bay area (good selection, fair prices and quality). Meat and dairy have prices slightly higher that a regular grocery store. Stick with the veggies there.<//text>

It was okay the last visit I just needed to return an item. Since I did not get a receipt with the purchase they were telling me I could not return the item. I had to talk to the store manager to get approval it was kind of disappointing. All and all I do like Sprouts their produce is very good and they do have a very good vitamin Department as well. Some of the baked goods are very yummy and their sandwich Deli area is slow but the sandwiches are tasty. January 28th 2020. When asked if I would like a receipt or not I would rather not have a receipt. I assumed that since I paid with a credit card I would be able to return items if needed. It is my fault for not reading the return policy in advance. We all know how mr. Hand feels about people who assume. I will hang onto my receipt when buying vitamins or lifestyle items in the future and give back one star for a total of 4. Thank you for getting back to me and making my one return happen.  I bought several items that day that was the only thing that did not agree with me. I definitely like the staff the produce and a vitamin department is pretty good as well especially when they have 25% off sales.< /text>

I love coming to this place.
Even through the pandemic they have healthy options at affordable prices.
I'm just sad that I can't bring my own reusable bag and get anything in bulk as I used to do but I understand this is for our own safe.
The staff is very friendly and always willing to help.

My grocery go-to store in the area. They have all the basics plus a decent selection of wine. Always a good sale on fresh produce and fruit and much less crowded than other local stores a like TJ around the corner. Make sure to come earlier in the day rather than later to avoid some empty shelving as items inevitably sell out. Decent customer service too!< /Review>

The female staff at the checkout with purple hair was very rude.

We’ve been to a few sprouts in the Bay Area and this one seemed not so well stocked and for a few dairy items we were looking to buy, we struggled to find ones that are now 1-2 days to the best by date.</text>

These guys are are just the best. I only just discovered Sprouts after living in this area for over a year now, and I already regret all the time I missed out on.
Their product line is just amazing, and they've got everything you could need. It might seem bare bones are first since the store is on the smaller side and just has a few brands, but when you look closer, they're the right brands for the product and prices are pretty pretty good.
My favorite part is honestly their bulk section. I used to go to the Whole Foods around the corner, but no more. These guys are always stocked up, and with quality items. A recent experience I had was with buying Nutritional Yeast. I really use a lot of it and used to get it from Whole Foods bulk since it was the cheapest but still tasted so much better than the bottled ones our there. But they had been out for weeks. I called every day asking about availability and after the 2nd week the person told me the distributor was out and didn't know when they would get any back. I was really upset and started researching other places to buy it on Amazon, but somehow (and thankfully) I remembered that Sprouts has a bulk section too. I called the store and they confirmed they had some. I went in and it was just the right kind I wanted. That amazing taste at also a low price. I'm not kidding, I bought over a pound of it.
The staff is also quite nice here. I've called on multiple occasions asking about product availability and prices (since I would need to travel 15 minutes there and back and wouldn't want to go home disappointed), evd and they were always quick to answer the call (unlike some other stores that would put you on hold forever) and would actually go to the aisles and come back with all the info I needed.
Going to be the first stop on all my grocery runs now.< /text>

This store lacks customer service, shelves are always half empty and they rarely front face products. Some of the employees look like they rolled out of bed and came to work. The employees don't smile or help customers. I saw one employee be rude to a customer. Sprouts need to copy Publix (store chain in the southeast).< /text>

<text>For regular grocery shopping, I'm sure this Sprouts is fine like any other location.  When I come to this location, it's usually to grab a quick bite for lunch.  That said the quality of their prepared foods is not the best.  A couple times I bought salads which were not fresh.< /text>< Pictures>

This used to be a good store, but had an awful experience lately. The bell peppers were infected with fungus/mold, not just one almost all left in the store were not fresh and many of them were infected. That's unacceptable!

The cashier was not pleasant to speak with. Seems quality of produce and service is declining.<//text>

Sprouts is the one of the best places in Silicon Valley for fresh produce, bulk food items, organic products, and meat products. We consistently find great deals there, and they often have sales, especially on the bulk food and meat items. The non-fresh foods don't have as many choices as other places, but the deals on fresh items make two grocery store stops well worth it.</review>

<Review>Im only giving it two stars because of the terrible and unprofessional way many people act and talk to their customers. This only lady gives me a really negative attitude and ive never even said a thing to her. Next time she does it I will summon the manager and we can talk about it. Some of the people are nice and and they do have some great deals. But I am amazed at how many of them act. The quality of the bakery items is 3rd rate. Be careful when you by meat and poultry.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1555269407740, 'text': "Hi Erik, we never want you to leave our store dissatisfied with the service you received.

Parking lot is a bit ghetto and hard to find as the store is not terribly visible from the street, but otherwise conveniently situated. The best gummy bears hands down. Also like to come here for some otherwise difficult to find organic/healthier products at non-Whole Foods prices.< /text>

We have converted to Sprouts after using Trader Joe's and Whole Foods. The people are nice, they have a good selection of products, and bulk bins which is a must for us. I also like that they have a well stocked wellness section (protein powder, medicine, and other health products) They also have a pretty good wine selection for a grocery store. My one wish is that they had a peanut butter machine like at Whole Foods.<//review>

Always love Sprouts Farmers Market. Lots of organic food and food I wants. However, this one is a little bit small.< /Review>

Spell 3 calories in one of those excellent me counters in Palo Alto California and Mountain View it is a very quiet little meat counter but they have the most wonderful sausages in the world I really it go down there mainly for their sausages when they're on sale for 299 a pound or less sometimes you can even pick up some chorizo which I highly recommend the tree so there because it is very nicely done with hamburger and there was no interns in it it's very uncooperative with interns in it if Monday most the time we could they might have cat food when you start yelling and I got a fancy cat not a person persons are not be able to digest a interns wasn't made of saliva glands from the cow to give it the to anus of it but it is nasty Realtree so is yours really waste as fat as it's nasty but anyways they got great to say it is it is it made from hamburger in the put the spices in it and there's no in Oregon's from it no origami< /review>

Kind of small for a a Sprouts, but has the same good selection if not a little more "curated". Better selection of seafood and meats than the Daly City Sprouts but same high quality of produce and bakery items.< /text>

Cheaper than Safeway for fresh produce and meat (often by a significant margin), plus it has extensive organic options for those interested.</Review>

It was weird to see a grocery store clerk act like a vigilante. She asked for our government issued IDs in front of so many people. Embarassing to be judged as illegals in a produce place. No thanks!</Review>

A really snotty cashier (male, attends Los Altos High)  told me, "he didn't know there was a qualification to work at Sprouts when he applied" when I told he crushed my bread at the bottom of my grocery bag.</review>

Consistently the best price on fuels. Off road diesel at the pump and the only pump kerosene I know about. Windshield washer equipment is there. Full, clean and ready to use. Even paper towels. Regular service stations can not pull this off! I purchase all of my fuel here.
The only thing I would change, add another pump to the gasoline tank, So that the dispensers do not slow to a trickle when all four are in use.
It is a pleasure to purchase fuel here.<//text><user_name>Wylie Fleeman< /user_name>< Date>

I walked here from Taylor farms got a burrito it was amazing. Bean and rice was perfect the staff was friendly the food is amazing. Price wasn't to bad ether. It's not a bad walk from the Taylor I will definitely go back when im in town. It was so cute the owners daughter was passed out with her head on a table. Gotta love small towns</text>

Eat here! The Aguachili is amazing. If you want decor, skip it, but if you want great food, check it out! Wet Macho chicken burrito, wonderful. Al la carte tacos, superb<//text>

<Review>The worst customer service with over priced food. Skinny burritos priced at 8 or 9 dollars! They weren't even good,  I wonder why people still go there.  I regret spending time and money at this unprofessional and sorry cooking place.<//Review>< pics>

<review>My husband and I ordered tacos de asada and al pastor, taquitos dorados de beef with rice and beans also orchata. The drink had the perfect amount of sugar no too sweet.
Overall the food was okay. But we were expecting spicy salsa. The beans were okay and it seems that they cook them with a little small amount of lard which is good because must of the Mexican restaurants used a lot of it. Delivery fast to our truck! Thanks< /review>< pics>

Food was cooked fresh and served piping hot! You know the food is going to be good. Especially when the guacamole is flourescent green and just perfect with lime and salt. I'll be back!</review>

We found this little place on our way up north. The owner was super polite and we got to know him and his story. The food was very good. I got chicken enchiladas and my bf got shrimp tostadas. We will definitely return on our future trips.<//text>

<text>The process went very smoothly from start to finish.  We contacted the company in early April and they were able to secure the necessary permits through Santa Clara County in a reasonable time frame.  The installation took place in the timeline we discussed and they were done in less than one day.  The Project Manager, Jesse Garcia, did a good job of keeping me informed of the process as well as helping me with how to use the online tool for monitoring the system.  I look forward to benefiting from the solar installation!<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x808566c2232c28fd:0x5a4349f2e9549b74</gmap_id></record>

High Definition did an excellent job installing my solar panels.  They arrived as promised and finished in one day.  They also cleaned up at the end of the day. Work was done professionally by their friendly installers.  Cody was my project manager and he is very easy to work with and never did I have any issues.  He was very accommodating.   The inspection by the county inspectors was able to accommodate my schedule.

I highly recommend High Definition for anybody wanting to install solar.   High Definition solar price is hard to beat as I had two other quotes prior to selecting High Definition.  Job well done!!!</Review>

Very satisfied with the solar install process thus far.  We got 3 quotes and chose HiDef Solar because they had very competitive pricing and the necessary experience to work with our more complicated roof design -- a combination of tile and foam.   We had 25 panels installed.  They really listen to customer requests and updated us frequently during the permit process.  Special thanks to Cody and Mark H. who went above and beyond to make the install go smoothly.  Martin M.,the salesperson was quite knowledgeable.  We love the system design and electricity production thus far.  All the installers were clean, polite, organized and efficient!</review>

I would like to express that our experience and the service has been below par ( standard). We have had a hard time getting a hold of them to get any correct information and any updates. Even try to get a hold of VP of Sales No response. They also promised us that the system would be up and running if not they you compensate us. It hasn't happen yet. Now they are avoiding our calls.< /text>

<text>Most of the personnel at High Definition Solar were professional and helpful. I was impressed with both depth of knowledge and sociability of the sales person, solar panel installer and project manager. All questions and concerns I had were addressed to my satisfaction. I was particularly impressed with the completion process conducted by David Huntley in which I was invited to provide feedback that would better grow the company- what an idea- that the customer might be right!<//text><Date>1578692016946< /Date>< Pics>

<rating>5< /rating><text>After listening to presentations from three companies, we checked with Armstrong who installed our foam roof.  They recommended High Definition Solar.  The process was smooth, it was always easy to make contact with our rep, the engineer, or whoever we needed.  Only criticism I have is that when the configuration of the panels was finalized, we were not advised and we would have preferred the second row further back from the patio so as to be less visible from the front.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>HD Solar is the first company that would work with our small electricity bill. I had been trying for a couple of years to get some panels installed, but most other places didn't bother to respond. All of the staff were punctual, and gave a good explanation of what they were doing and why. They helped through the full permitting process, including making sure that the smoke detectors were in place, and helped through a new (to me) regulation requiring that address numbers in San Bruno must be lit, following through with all of the process to make sure it was allowed.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<text>Informative, patient,  staff.  Initial delay in getting things started but panels went up, inspection was scheduled and a couple of visits took place to explain how the system works.

Two issues came up.......the first inspection was scheduled with a 4 hour arrival window.  Someone from High Definition Solar was supposed to   meet the Inspector at our home but never showed up.  The Inspector left and another meeting needed to be scheduled. Without any prior notice, on another day,  someone from High Definition arrived at 8AM for the inspection and waited for several hours for the Inspector  to arrive.

High Definition Solar wanted us to sign off on the project before the inspection was done and the workings of the system explained. We said we wouldn't sign off until we understood how everything worked and the inspection was completed.  They honored our requests and everything proceeded successfully.

High Definition Solar works hard to satisfy customer concerns.</text>< rate>

Very impressed with the company, their panels, their warranty, their installation approach and quality, and helpfulness with determining costs. They were upfront about all the costs and also provided good information about tax credits and other ways to save money on energy use. They sell great panels, and they look beautiful on our roof. We're pleased to support this group, and recommend them.</Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Don’t listen to reviews from friends of “former employees”, or so called “former employees” who are likely just disgruntled because they were bad at selling. I just recently peacefully resigned from here due to another business opportunity I wanted to take, and here’s what I have to say about High Definition Solar.
1. All the employees are the most genuine, professional, positive, and helpful people you will ever meet.
2. The training is spectacular and questions and constant improvement are highly encouraged.
3. We are taught to be honest and respectful of all customers, and not to take advantage of the elderly or disabled.
4. The microinverter system they use is factually superior to other system designs, regardless of what your DIY neighbor says, it’s not just the company blowing smoke, the technology is better in every way and is all covered by a 25yr warranty.
5. The company is actually Diamond Certified, and A+ on BBB, contrary to Bob’s review that implies that they are not accredited by the BBB.
6. Yes we are taught to try to sell to customers, obviously, that’s the job of a sales rep, it’s not “slimy sales”, it’s not “dishonest”, it’s selling, the same thing every other successful company in the world does.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

My wife and I had an excellent experience with the HDS team. From a very friendly and thorough initial consultation, to project scheduling and management, to install, it was a very seamless and easy experience. The only minor hiccup was that our electrical panel needed to be upgraded, which added an extra day to the install (we were made aware before purchase that this might be required pending inspection). I would certainly recommend the team at HDS, given the level of professionalism and value of the product/work done.< /Review>

My husband and I were so pleased by the honesty, professionalism, and timely response of this family-owned company. They really practice true customer service: all of our interactions with their canvasser to their sales consultant, Luke, project manager, Dan, the installation crew, then their customer relationship consultant, Dave, were stellar. They explain everything, show graphs, & answer any questions, but never put pressure on a sale, just give the data. They also give several options for how many panels to use to optimize the solar energy intake but take into account the price of the total panels used, within our budget. Our installation was done in one day, and was inspected and connected to PG&E that same day. We have recommended this company already to friends and neighbors. The follow-up appointment with Dave on how to monitor our solar generation and our consumption was so helpful and pleasant. We are very happy.< /text>

With everything that we're experiencing here in Northern California telling us that climate change is real, and that we need to reduce our dependence on centralized power generation, we decided to do our part and go solar.  We had been contemplating adding solar for a while so when Joe from High Definition Solar knocked on our door a week after we had been off power for 3 days thanks to a PG&E power shut off, we were ready to buy.  We went with High Definition because we felt they had the best technology, were reassured by the 4 diamond rating and the people we met with were knowledgeable and informative.  Like any project, there were a few minor hitches but it's clear that everybody involved cares about the customer, believes in the value of solar and wants to do the right thing.  Despite the hitches, the panels were installed promptly and have been working perfectly since day 1.  The one thing that could have been given more attention to is the location of the controller box and the routing of conduit.   We would have preferred a less intrusive and less visible location for the box, the box intrudes into a narrow passage, and for the conduit routed to more closely follow the contours of the house.  I hope that in the future the project managers and installers will spend more time with the customer to help them understand this aspect of the installation.  Nevertheless, I would recommend High Definition Solar to anybody who is considering rooftop solar.</Review>

The salesmen gave us a lot of information. He was very patient with us - Great follow up - we did not do the roof we did the solar. The project manager was a brief visit. Everything went smoothly after his visit, great communication. He went above and beyond! Recommend that install staff educate on the cleaning of panels. Pg&e should be quicker at connecting. The follow up by this company is excellent, overall we are happy with our decision.</review>

This company called my 80+ year old parents to let them know that they needed 6 more panels.  My parents had no idea if they needed them or not.  (NOT)  To my brother and I that is unthinkable.  It is an investment over time, but come on.  REALLY!  They are in their 80's and are in failing health, with Visiting Angel and VA nursing helping them seven days a week.

When final payment came due, we were brought up to date on the situation and found out that High Definition Solar kept calling my parents until they agreed to meet with them.  The VA nurse said that they pressured my parents until they agreed to purchase over $13,000 worth of additional panels.They certainly did not need to spend anymore money for something that would not have a long term benefit from.

Now they have 12 panels on the house and no longer live there because they moved to assisted living.  And this all occurred in less than six months after they were persuaded to add more panels.

This is absolutely outrageous and this company should be ashamed of themselves and of their employees.

We did contact an attorney and we were told that small claims court was our only option.  I am still considering pursuing legal action.<//Review>

High Definition Solar was a jewel of a find. The whole experience with High Definition Solar was the best, from the first contact to the installation and to the final inspection, it has been a very positive experience. The installation of the solar panels at our home was done quickly and without any mess. I hope that future clients of High Definition Solar experience the professionalism of this solar company. My wife and I give High Definition Solar the highest possible recommendation.</review>

The sales rep were knowledgable, professional and extremely patient! I had a lot of questions and they took their time to explain everything to me. Everything was process very quickly and the installation happened as scheduled. Once everything was installed we had to wait for a while before it was turned on. I would have appreciated it someone had reached out to me while we were waiting for SMUD to approve the installation. I got an email from SMUD that everything was ready go but did not hear from HD. I had to reach out to them. Once I reached out, they came out immediately to help and answer all my questions and concerns. Overall, I am very happy with HDS.<//text>

I started with 6 panels and a year later added 8 more.  High Def Solar was professional, quick to answer questions, fast with installation, friendly, and always helpful.  I felt like my business mattered to them and that they were working hard to provide excellent customer service.   I received a quality product.< /Text>

<Text>Stay away from this company! I had a friend that was employed by them who informed be about their business practices and they are appalling. First of all, they deliberately lie to their employees that go door to door to setup appointments who have minimal training and little understanding of Solar Power options. Based on the lies they are told by the company they will repeat them and mislead those they are speaking with.  They have a huge amount of employee turnover since those who do any research of their own get tired of peddling lies, those who stay often do so because they have little other employment options.

They tell their employees that they are able to install systems fit to anyone's needs and that anyone as low as a $100 monthly electric bill can save money. The fact of the matter is that they have a minimum requirement on the panels that they will install which is far in excess of what someone with such low energy usage would require. They also state that they use the most advanced solar technology available which is really just the industry standard. They try to state that the microinverters they use are far superior to a standard inverter system but conceal the additional long term costs involved with this system or the fact that microinverters are not necessarily the ideal solution for all systems. They also lie and state that homes with significant tree coverage throughout the day will generate much more energy than they actually they would because of their "magic" microinverters. They also train their employees to hound anyone they speak with for an appointment regardless of how inconvenient the time may be for the homeowner.

Additionally, they will claim that they are running a special promotional program that they always "just started" and is available for a "limited time" when it is always running. They will only schedule a sales meeting if all homeowners are present because they want to close the deal on the first meeting. They will pretend to offer a special discount that is only available if you make the purchase that day. Thus, it is a high pressure sales tactic. Additionally, if you cancel the meeting or decide to pass, expect to receive follow up calls for months.

They try to state that they are specially qualified because they are Diamond Certified but this is little different than paying for any other "seal of approval" like the Better Business Bureau accreditation, just from a more obscure organization with a flashier name.

If you want to have Solar panels installed there are many other contractors who will do so for much cheaper (albeit with a lesser warranty) or other much larger and established companies that will be around the same price level. Do not reward a company with such shady business practices.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x808566c2232c28fd:0x5a4349f2e9549b74< /gmap_id></record>

I really liked High Definition Solar and am extremely happy with my solar panels. The installation was quick, the people are extremely helpful and knowledgeable, and very hands-on. I feel that as a result of working with High Definition Solar, I am now almost an expert on how it works. I'm producing more energy than I ever thought I would and the online web site showing my production is extremely helpful. I highly recommend them!<//Text>

Each person I dealt with was friendly, on-time, and knew their stuff. I do wish I had known before my in-home sales consultation that I would receive a discount for signing up that day. But I appreciated being able to take advantage of the discount. :-) The install process went smoothly. The company followed up with me to make sure I was getting full use of their charting software and to make sure I was 100% satisfied with my experience. Over and over again it was evident to me that this company places a high priority on customer satisfaction and honesty. I would happily use them again.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

High Def Solar was awesome to work with.  The sales rep was very polite and knowledgeable and made the whole solar expierence worth it.  The CS rep was also great to work with.  He came to our house and gave us a break down of our PG&E bill and what to expect.  The installer did an awesome job, they were so tidy and clean!

< review>
My husband and I couldn't have been happier with everyone we worked with from start to finish. I always wanted solar but my husband didn't want holes poked in his roof. After the sales rep met with both of us and my husband learned High Definition is also a roofing company he became convinced and secure about moving forward with the project. We are happy we did! I love being able to track my panels and usage online!</review>

Deceitful and unprofessional. Company lied about the type of loan they offered. I asked specifically and Vice President was cunning and dismissive when I found out the truth!
Unnecessary because if they were honest we could have paid cash or used some other form of payment. Reached out to the President of company and NO RESPONSE, NO APOLOGIES, NOTHING!</Text>

<review>I would highly recommend High Definition Solar to anyone considering solar for their home for several reasons including:
1.  all their staff I met where very professional from sales personnel to project manager to installers and finally customer relations post installation
2. in addition all their staff were very knowledgeable and able to explain in in simple language how their system works, the financial benefits, how the system is monitored after installation, and without any sales pressure
3. I was pleased and how easy the entire process went in such a short amount of time and how this company emphasized customer satisfaction via their representative employees< /review></record></dataset><record>

Sales guys were great, Project Manager had a very pleasant personality and was very thorough and brought up things he needed to. Install Crew also did a great job, they were great workers and
very conscientious. They explained the entire process step by step, kept us apprised of all steps.
Solar is the way of the future, I love using Natures gift for my energy. I would highly recommend
High Definition Solar.<//review>

My initial sales man was very real and honest, without the high pressure sales tactics of the normal salesman. Installation was done in one day, to my great surprise. I like the fact that their was one inverter per each panel, to minimize the working of all panels should one fail, and so I can monitor each panel. I was very happy that High Definition was able to work around and with my very hectic schedule, even though I couldn't be present most of the time.</Text>

<date>1447374610763<//date><review>We had 8 panels installed this summer. Everything was easy and clearly explained so we could purchase only the number of panels that made economic sense.
I like the fact that we own the units, that the panels operate independently so it's easy to add new ones later if we want, and that we are working with a family-owned small business.
High Definition Solar helped us get into the PG&E program that requires they buy any excess energy we produce.
Everyone from sales to installation to getting our feedback was professional, friendly and well informed.
This company is serious about quality and customer service!</review><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

We had 7 solar panels installed this summer and were extremely satisfied with the whole process from the thorough and clear presentation made to us in our home, to financing options and the very quick turnaround for installation once we signed the contract. We are proud to have solar panels on our house and it is great that it has increased the value of our home while also saving us with our monthly PG&E bills. It is a win/win all the way around.<//Review>

Great company to go with if you're looking into solar.  They were very knowledgeable and kept us in the loop with each step.  The salesman was very thorough and not pushy at all.  The face to face follow up meeting at the end of the process was very informative definitely unique to this company.<//review>

<review>The interactions with every level of professional at this company was excellent. There was a sales process that was primarily informative and without any pressure. The salesperson made every effort to explain the costs and rebates available to me to reduce the overall cost of the project.The installation and installers did a terrific job. They arrived and completed the installation exactly in the time frame that had been shared with me. I've particularly appreciated the company follow-up to ensure all is well and to inquire what they can do to further assist me.<//review>< pictures>

<Text>There are mysteries to Solar electricity, such as: will I make enough power to offset my bill, will PG&E agree to Net Metering and when will it start, and how much will the whole installation cost.  Fortunately High Definition is a straight forward company that will
remove the clouds from the process.  I've never had a more positive experience with
a service company.  From the initial service call to the final customer service check up
the company has done what they've said they will.  Without fail.  I recommend them
highly.</Text>< pictures>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>High Definition Solar installed a roof at my house.  When finished working the first day, they did not realize that it was going to rain that evening and did not protect the roof.  Due to the rain, there was water on the bathroom floor, sheet rock damage to the ceiling in the bedroom and water leaked through and left water marks on the ceilings in multiple rooms.
My main issue is the way that they are handling the incident.  I called when they opened and advised them of the issue.  The person was apologetic and advised that he would send someone to look at it.  The person they sent out viewed the damage only.  He did not take any notes.  A day later, I had to follow up to see what the next steps would be.  They sent a gentleman out ten (10) days after the follow up call, on a Sunday, and he reviewed the damage and was going to provide a quote, although I was told he would be out to fix the issue.  The gentleman also advised that he drove from Vallejo (my residence is in Sacramento) and that he has a regular job during the week and is doing this as a favor for his friend that works at High Definition Solar.  I called once again the day after he left and spoke to the Director of Operations and voiced my concerns and mentioned I did not feel like they were treating their customer like they were a priority.  She said that was not the case, but it continued to show when she called back to set up a time for the person to come out and the day available was Sunday, Father's Day.  I told her that would not work as we are out of town the next two (2) weekends and she said she would call me back in five (5) minutes.  This was on a Monday and I received no call.  I called Tuesday and left a message still with no return call.  I called Wednesday morning and asked to speak to her and was told she was just walking into a meeting.  I asked to speak to her boss and was told there was no one over her.  I asked for the owner of the company’s name and was put on hold and the initial person I asked for was on the line with no update on when someone will be out to fix the damage they caused.
When we initially set a start date and they called days later and advised the current job they were working on ran over and asked can they start Monday and my husband advised that was okay.  Two (2) days later they called and said they did not realize that was Memorial Day and said they would start Tuesday.  Initially I was understanding since it typically does not rain in May but felt like in that line of business, the company should be more abreast of the forecast.  But considering the aftermath, they clearly do not pay attention to details that can affect their customers, i.e. paying attention to Holidays and the weather and calling back when promised.  Customer service was great and once the contract was signed went downhill!
When looking to spend $15,000 - $25,000 on a roof, I do not recommend this company!</Text>< Pictures>

A sales person came calling at our door selling solar. We have been in the market for a solar installation and a new roof as well in our Walnut Creek home. He was very polite and my wife made an appointment to get a roof estimate on Tuesday, 11-22. He said that they would call and confirm the appointment during the weekend. When they called to confirm they said the only way they could do an estimate is both my wife and myself be present. "It was their policy". Often times there is no one home when I have gotten estimates for work on our home. The only reason they would require both people to be home is because we BOTH have to sign a sales contract. That instantly told me that this will be a high pressure sell. I always get multiple estimate and NEVER accept the first person that gives me an estimate without comparing all the details.</Text>

This company is a rip-off. Look up on Google about why leasing panels is a bad idea. They also do door to door sales which drives me nuts. After years of life I've realized that if they sell it door to door it isn't a good product. After researching the product I decided on not going through with it. Which is fine. Except for the last year I've been getting call after call. They always call at the worst time. I tell them every time to take me off the call list. I still receive calls. Today they called me twice. Don't support this company. If you open your door you'll never get rid of them.</Text>

My experience hasn't been whole yet - I have yet to call them for service calls and such.  But consultation, installation and follow up has been great so far.  Could improve communication during installation, though - they called either on the day or the day before.<//Review>

The salesman, contractor, and workmen were all professional and courteous and spent a lot of time answering my questions. The panels were installed within a few weeks of signing the contract. After the panels were installed and placed into service a representative visited my home by appointment to explain monitoring and PG&E billing practices. I am quite pleased and I am getting good production numbers on the panels.<//review>

Called because I needed repairs on a 12-year old existing PV system.  The inverters have reached the end of their lifespan.  First I was transferred to sales.  Then I was offered an entirely new solar installation.  When I pointed out my panels still had at least 20 years of life on them, the lady then told me they don't do repairs or sell inverters to people who don't own a system they have installed.  The fact the company that did my original installation was out of business didn't matter to them.

I then asked for a referral to a company that did repairs on existing systems.  (I cannot believe this hasn't been asked of them at least a thousand times)  She acted like I was the first person to ever suggest this and said they had no referrals. She didn't have any information on any contractors that didn't work for High Definition.  This would be like taking a car to a Chevy dealer and having them tell you they can't repair it because you didn't buy the car from them.  STILL trying to find a contractor that will take my money.<//review>

We had a great experience with this company.  Everyone we worked with was great - sales, installation, office staff, etc.  They took care of everything from start to finish and answered our questions.  I would recommend them to friends and use them again.<//Text>

<Review>They have promised  to make certain amount of power and they put it in the contract. Yet  their system does not make a guaranteed power minimum that they told me it would make. I have called the company numerous times and they're full of excuses. Chris zaponi told me to wash my solar panels.  They have been in for under two years. I have had two reps come to my house to check on the system and they both agreed that the system is under delivering. Yet they have done nothing about it. I just wanted them to add the appropriate amount of panels to deliver the amount of Power that their system should have provided.  I guess the only thing to do next is to take them to court<//Review>< GmapID>

<review>Best experience and best purchase ever. High Definition Solar is by far the best solar company I've found, and I researched at least 5 different companies. HDS had everything I was looking for in a solar system and  with a team of professional,  respectful and  courteous employees. I'm already telling everyone about this company, oh yea, and I will be referring. Thanks to all at HDS!< /review>< name>

I am so pleased with High Definition Solar and how they helped us save over $300+/month on our energy bill. From the initial contact, to the salespeople, to the installers and the customer followup they were personable, honest and capable in their professionalism.
The fact that they were first, and continue to be, a roofing company that also installs solar was a big selling point. I feel that the integrity of my roof has not been compromised by the fasteners that secure the panels to the roof because it has all been flashed and sealed properly. I love the fact that the solar units are in parrallel instead of in series and that each panel has it's own inverter; it's just better engineering. I also think that owning the panels outright, getting the government rebate, and having no easement on my roof is an honest and straightforward marketing and business model. This company did just what they said they would do, at the quoted price, in the time they said they woud do it and left not one scrap of mess behind. I will recommend this High Definition Solar to anyone who asks me about my decision to go solar.< /text>

I wanted solar panels for a long time, but had not found anyone I felt  comfortable with until I met HD Solar. The salesman presented the facts about solar and their company without any high pressure sales tactics. There was a good project management starting with a preconstruction meeting to collect measurements and our concerns with the installation plan. The day of installation went smooth, quick, and very neat. And when I thought it was over the customer service continued with a post installation follow up. Now I feel happy and my roof is making dollars. Thanks HD Solar.</review>

The installation team was very professional. I like that you can track your panels' production online, and that they check how you are doing months later. I do not like their sales model of cold call, high pressure tactics. Their salesmen should not wear cologne.< /review>

I had an appointment with a sales man and we went thorough all this stuff and then after about 45 minutes he asked about my wife and when he found out my wife was not there he left.... he knew that when he walked in since he did not see my wife.  Why did he not stop the appointment in the beginning.. something seems off.</review>

The biggest benefit that eight panels gave me, is "under $20/month" power bill.
When I had asked some who already installed, the sales manager  let me know the evergreen houses in San Jose.
And the technician taught me how to make the tax credit form in detail.< /text>

Smallest coffee place I've ever been but, big in charm and personality. Everytime I come to So. Lake Tahoe I love to visit this place. Staff are welcoming, friendly and always make me feel good about being there. You can also enjoy a morning walk as you sip your coffee at the trail behind Free Bird. The dirty chai, extra spicy is fantastic!< /text>

younger female barista and older male barista served a customer who was not wearing a mask. he was in the store for over 2 minutes (I waited outside) and as he left, they each fist-bumped him. they did not wash their hands and proceeded to ask me what I wanted. when I asked if they served the customer without the mask, the girl turned to the male and he said 'oh, uh, his beard covered it'. I walked out without ordering - you need to follow CDC guidelines and local regulations.</Review>

Great quick stop. Simple smoothies and bowls. Good cookies and muffins and bagels from local suppliers. There's a back parking lot, some outdoor seating.</text>

I absolutely love going here! If I could, I would go here everyday! Aaron and crew are super kind people. I love their Vanilla Lattes but their chai is amazing as well. Go here if you are in the area. :)< /review>

<text>The baristas are the bomb. Friendly, remember your name and your order. True local spot. I go for the chai and sometimes a smoothie. Each are great. Chai is strong and spicy with a heavy clove mix.</text>< pictures>

<Text>Lovely coffee shop in South Lake Tahoe. I live in Seattle and this coffee is on par with anything I find back home. They have lots of vegan and vegetarian options for coffee, smoothies and baked treats. The nicest people and great prices. Got a coffee and muffin for $10. Ihave been here less than a week and they know me :)<//Text>< Pictures>

Great Coffee and Other Concoctions! I moved to South Lake Tahoe in August and there was *nowhere to get a good coffee or beans until I found this place. And if you're hungry or want a delicious smoothie loaded with nutrition they do that as well. Kind of amazing all they do in this tiny place.<//Text>

<Text>Honestly I'm really dissapointed. This was a cute little shop. My bf and I both ordered vanilla lattes and they didn't put coffee in mine. I'm not even kidding. He got a 7/10 vanilla latte and I got warm milk. If there was any coffee, it was in trace amounts. I would have gone back but we already hit the road. :(< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1471666031742, 'text': "I am extremely sorry for what happened to you.

There is another Freebird i frequented down the street, but it is not coming up on google maps. Regardless, they are pretty much the same thing. I lived across the street from the other one during my time in South Lake Tahoe, and went there several times a week for breakfast. Their bagels and smoothies are both awesome. I like their chai tea as well. The owner is cool. Good spot.< /text>

This place is simply amazing! Wonderful sweet lady made me the sea bird smoothie which is absolutely delicious! I also tried the acai bowl with yogurt - heaven! I got my bf an iced hazelnut latte, she asked me for the amount of sweetness and boy it was one of the best iced drinks I've tasted! will definitely be coming back here - especially for the homemade chai!!!<//review>

Absolutely worth the trip out of town (especially if a bike is handy) considering Heaven(ly) is missing good coffee within the city limits.. Sublime coffees, shakes, chais, etc.< /Review>

Excellent coffee beans from a well-known roaster in the Bay Area.  He was really focused on getting me the perfect shot: adjusted the grind and did a couple pulls until he arrived at perfection.  Sadly no space to hang out inside , so works best on-the-go.< /Review>

The moment you walk in your nose tells you that you've found the right place. I'm a discerning Chai lover. Freebird has the best Chai I've ever had in my life. Nothing else I've had anywhere compares. The staff are super friendly and even when there's 10 people packed into their tiny shop they work fast and take great care of every customer. Oh and they have some of the best smoothies too!<//text>

<Review>Horrible, HORRIBLE drive thru management.  You'd think it was rocket science from the way the kids working there manage to mess it all up.  I could've driven to my workplace and back by the time I got my order!  Really, NO ONE should have to wait 18 minutes just for a grande white mocha.. and by the way, the mocha was LUKEWARM.  If it weren't for the fact that I had to get to work, I would've asked them to make me a new one immediately, because that kind of service is completely unacceptable in my opinion.  From now on, I think I will just stick to the Starbucks at Willow Station.<//Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>Slow slow slow. This is by far the longest drive thru wait at a Starbucks in town. I have waited up to 25 or 30 minutes in this drive thru before. Even when the cafe was closed inside due to COVID-19, and all workers were there handle the drive thru since that’s all that was open, they’re still extremely slow. Get to the window and wait even more...for what? The baristas aren’t very friendly either and would rather pay attention to their coworkers when a customer is present than actually be friendly to the customer. Would much rather pick the Target Starbucks or another location nearby especially for saving time!!< /text><UserId.>107419448669079214011<//UserId.><Time>1613538766082< /Time><gmap_id>0x80945c9f2fc55af3:0x1ae763ed04c97507<//gmap_id>< Pics>

They use to have wonderful employees here that care but its seem like there is a new team and they can care less. There was a piece of plastic in my drink and I call to tell them but they didn't do anything about it. I always have to ask them for supplies when I order food. When I last mobile order from here (20mins early) my breakfast wasn't ready and they made me late for work. I slowly stop making my morning stop here due to their lack of work. There is another Starbucks just down a ways that I rather go to now. Every now and then I stop if the other one has a long line.< /text>

My husband ordered the wrong item for breakfast, and Helen helped us in the drive thru, she was so sweet and kind! She remade the item he MEANT to order and it was hot and ready before my coffee even came out! Excellent customer service and a happy attitude is hard to find these days. Thanks so much!< /Review>

Always make my coffee perfectly to order. Not much inside space for groups but tons of laptop space and plugs for working. Outside patio is large, shaded, and very nice to sit at, with larger table seating.< /review>

<Text>They do not know how to make an iced nonfat latte. Whoever is making the drinks is adding way too much milk. They remade my drink and it was exactly the same.  Very frustrating,  as I've been drinking this drink for 20 years. Normally, do not have a problem with Starbucks<//Text>< Gmap_id>

Often out of banana bread, pound cake. Croissants last longer. Almonds kind go fast. Out of 6 people, none of us liked the chocolate kind, but I know some people do. It was slow. Drive through often extremely packed. Sometimes you can get lucky and it is not. Going inside isn't much faster.< /Review>

I like their tea. Always order it the same way, lathe black ice tea, no water no ice. Love it. Also, cheaper than a lot of hipster tea places.<//Review>

<review>Ignore all negative people reviews, they (we all as people) wake up with Poop in our pants, and therefore are cranky and unreliable every morning, poor Starbucks these people are working so very Hard, i know first-hand, my Sister and brother and all my friends worked/work at Starbucks, Its Hard. If even Glory Heaven (Paradise) itself were in front of us, we as humans would still be capable of conceiving/saying bad things.

Go!!!!!!!!! Herndon and Willow Starbucks, y'all are Fabulous, Exquisite, Excellent, Encouraging and Fast+Timely, and relaxed Environment! Keep it up!

What place doesn't keep a fresh brewed pot of Pikes Place ready? This place. Multiple times, at different times of day, they are out and ask if I want to wait for them to brew a pot. I'd ask if the manager if he read these posts but I doubt since they have only starbucks with a ranking under lower than any other in Fresno and Clovis< /Review>

<Review>I never post reviews but this Starbucks has terrible customer service, girl working the drive thru was very rude and condescending, pretty much made me feel like I was stupid, Brit was her name. Ordered a medicine ball and asked it to be made with jade citrus mint because I’ve ordered it before at this location and they made it with mint majesty, I wasn’t rude or anything but she straight up was condescending about it, when I drove up to the window to pay she just handed me my drink with no “thank you” not even a “have a nice day”< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80945c9f2fc55af3:0x1ae763ed04c97507</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I get the same drink once or twice a day. Rude, snarky, bad business. She ended up charging me for something I didn’t order and when I tried to correct her she was rude and acted as if I just didn’t want to pay the extra.. what?< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Very nice people who work here. Very sweet and polite. But this is thee most awful slowest service I've ever had at a Starbucks. Was in the drive through for 28 f*****g minutes yes TWENTY EIGHT and there's no place to leave the drive through because of the building design. COMPLETE lunacy. And the employees could care less people are trapped in the drive through instead of telling people to pull forward and walk out their orders or tell them they can't make the drink in time and can't keep up and just send people along because waiting this long in this line is a f*****g joke.<//Review>

<Text>I have to say a big factor in evaluating one Starbucks over another is WiFi speed. This is one of the locations with the network enhanced by Google, so it's quite zippy. Crowded in the early evening with study groups and friends who gather for coffee.<//Text>< Rating>

I was in this Starbucks couple of days ago. Me and my Dear Brother was talking Arabic together. At the time I came to order my Drink the barista call us camels. The Barista used his white privilege to get out of it. The manager didnt do anything about it and ditch the case. He promise to call back and he didn't. Sorry to see America going to his direction. America use to be Great! Everyone use to be Equally Before the Law. Sad to see it going bad like this! God Bliss America we use to have.</text>

<Text>Barista at register was excellent. Barista handing off drinks was really bad. Worst experience I've had. Handed off drink without greeting or saying thank you. Walked away and focused on other things. We stayed for another moment to see if she would acknowledge us and nothing. Gina. I'll never forget that kind of service and never go back to that store. This is coming from Clovis. Of all places.< /Text><date>1444790343358<//date>< GmapID>

I hardly ever go out of my way to get a Starbucks and this morning I found the time to go get myself a Chai Tea Latte. Let me just say it was the worst Chai tea I have ever have. I would think all Starbucks would be consistent on how they make their drinks but I guess not. What a waist of my time and money.<//Review>

Terrible location! Too bad I can't give it 0 stars. No creamer on Sunday morning at 8:30am...they open at 4:30am. I waited 3 min twice to make 2 different orders. There are out of decaf, chai tea, and smoked butterscotch. Who the hell runs this place?< /Text>

Went into Blue Rock, received horrible customer service outside in their yard. Very lazy did not want to take the time and felt that we were putting them out. It was a Saturday morning and lazy as could be I will not use them any longer I will take all my business to M&M landscape materials on Baxter. Great customer service there.< /Review>

<review>Fast and very helpful. I didn't catch the woman's name (receipt says Allison) she was nice, helped us figure out how much rocks we could carry in our vehicle, and was careful but fast when she loaded the rocks into the bed of our truck with a bobcat.</review></record>

< review>
We have been going to Blue Rock for a few years now as we need materials for our home projects. I have yet to have a negative experience of any kind. I think the prices are fair, and quality of all the different materials we've picked up and had delivered leaves nothing to complain about.  The staff is always friendly and accommodating. We started using them for a few cubic yards of garden dirt to fill above ground planters in a garden house i built. No problems with the quality of dirt. Plants and veggies grew fine. For our most recent large project, we completely re-landscaped our front yard to low water, rock and drought tolerant plants. We wanted some variance and topography to imitate the southwest region. We did all the work ourselves but all the rock material came from Blue Rock. We had several yards of a few different types of rock delivered.  The driver did a good job dropping the rock off, keeping the different types separated which made things easier for us. The end result has promoted many compliments from neighbors and friends. While we did the work, I must say we're glad to have used Blue Rock for materials that look great and made the landscape reno affordable. We'll be using them again very soon for our backyard landscape, now that our pool is done. Thanks Blue Rock, and we'll see you again soon!</review>

<Text>A truck driver for their company (license plate # 8K40196) was driving like a complete tool on the 74 highway near Lake Elsinore. He flashed his high beams at me, even though I wasn’t driving slowly, swerved around me and cut me off. The funny thing is that it seems he wasn’t even in a rush because once we got on the 15 S freeway, he stopped speeding.
If you’re going to drive like a jerk, don’t do it in a company truck.<//Text>< pics>

I would give a -10 stars if I could. These people seem nice until we had an issue with their product and then they turn into the worst nightmare we've ever had. We were supposed to get some small colored rock, basically like colored P gravel, they told my wife before they delivered it-that it had not been washed yet. What we ended up with was dirt mixed with the p-gravel type rock. We told them the rock was basically 25 to 35% dirt. We paid laborers to install the rock, then we tried to wash the rock, what we ended up with was rock embedded in mud. Basically we are doing a low water landscaping and the whole idea is to not have weeds growing as well. We put down the weed barrier and then of course the rock material goes on top of the weed barrier. The material they sent was so full of dirt basically weeds would have germinated in the dirt they sent us and the weed roots would have gone through the weed barrier. We asked them to come back and take the faulty material away and refund us the cost on that part of the materials we order only. I told them not only did I have to pay the labor to put the material down and I now have to pay the labor to take material out. To get a refund they basically told me I would have to load up about 12 yards of material, ship it back to them which is 25 miles away to get a refund. Then the owner agreed he would have the delivery truck come back which just left my house about 15 minutes earlier if I would pay my guys the labor to shovel material back into his truck. After tense conversation I agreed to eat about 240 in labor due to their faulty material just to get a refund of about 400 on the faulty material. After they had their truck driver come back, my guys spent 1 1/2 hours loading up this companies faulty  material,  my wife gets a call from this place telling us they were going to charge us a 20% restocking fee and here's the reason why.  They said they had a pay their driver for the extra hour that he had to wait while we paid our guys labor to load up their truck with their faulty material. I called them and I was not too nice and I let them know that I've already absorb costs on labor here because of their faulty materials and that we were not paying the 20% restocking fee and that that was never agreed to. The owners daughter who was belligerent, would not even let me talk, every time I tried to explain; all she did is over talk me and tell me I won't listen to her, I wouldn't listen because she kept saying the same thing she was saying before which was not acceptable.  These people expected us to adsorb costs and time and energy because of their faulty material, and then wanted us to pay for their truck drivers time or a 20% restocking fee and for us to absorb labor for their mistake. These people are bad business people, please beware; they are nice until they have your money, but if they make a mistake it's the person buying their materials fault not theirs. The root cause of the issue was, on the morning of our delivery they told my wife that one of the products they have, small P gravel type rock had not been washed yet and offered a $10 discount per yard. They didn't tell my wife that basically it was 25 to 35% dirt, they said not washed. Instead they said it's not our fault, it's your wife's fault because we told her it had not been washed and she accepted, thinking that we can relate not washed to 25 to 35% dirt. My wife expectations was we are getting the small P gravel type rock that would have basically a coating of dust or a light coating of dirt. But what we ended up with was basically P gravel type rock mixed with about 25-35% dirt and when we tried to wash the dirt off of the small rock we basically ended up with small p gravel type rock embedded in mud. Would you want that at your home?< /text>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>We bought 3 1/2 yards of stone from Blue Rock. About a yard of it was just dirt. We were unable to use this portion of our rock. When we called they told us that it is customary to have dirt in the rock. They refused to come pick it up or to give us actual rock to replace what it unusable. We are now stuck with trying to remove this pile of dirt, and figuring out what to do with it. On top of it all, they dumped the load on our grass instead of the driveway, so our lawn is ruined too. This is a terrible company with no customer service.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><user_id>107757684553815694336<//user_id></record>

Used this company many times, without issue. Cheaper than RCP Block and Brick on Jefferson.

Materials purchased have been gravel, DG, clean fill dirt, pavers, flagstone.

Never have had a problem with them. Good service, and only 5 minutes from my house.<//text>

Very friendly neighborhood. During the summer you can swim in the pool or get in the hot tub. There is a nice place for parties. Guest parking available.< /text>

<Text>A good place to see some mobile homes. Went to visit my friend Angie on a scorching day summer day after being evacuated because of the Blue Cut fire. We put our bathing suits on and went to the pool, AND IT WAS CLOSED! No notice posted. Boo to the property management for not notifying residents of the closure. Perfectly clean streets and public areas.< /Text>< userid>

<review>Let me start by saying ......Too many tweakers going in and out all day/night. Cars parking in free spaces for months and not towed..Dude with 4 broken down landscape vans taking up parking spaces (he dont live here). Theres another dude owning a used car dealership taking over spaces as well. (Always see him up front by office trying to sell cars). It would be a much better park to live in if these issues were resolved but its been this way for years.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Great food. Just got green tea, fresh spring shrimp roll, and grilled chicken Bahn Mi sandwich.  Tasty. Didn't feel like getting ice cream today, but next time.</review>

Hidden gem. Just my kind of "frou-frou" breakfast, my husband would call it. First of all its at the end of this non-descript strip mall next to O'Reilly's and a few vacant business suites. Inside, though, the place has a nice rustic look to it with wood beams hanging from the ceiling and the ambience made cozy by a faux fireplace by the seating area with leather love seat and a trio of hammered copper coffee tables. The orange juice is freshly squeezed. I had the Chylls waffle with just enough fresh fruit and whipped cream on top. The bacon was crisped just the way I like it.
But why 4-stars you asked? Maybe because my husband had sourdough toast and they didn't have jam. Oh well. Doesn't keep me from coming back.
I'm excited to try their boba teas of which they have quite a selection. Next time we drive by....
Great job, Chyll people. Great job.<//review>

Good food and sandwiches but not crazy about the ice cream.  In order to roll it they really have to freeze it so it's hard and not very smooth or creamy. More of a fad dessert than enjoyable. Will go back for the food but not dessert.

Update 8/14/19

They recently added burgers to their menu and they are great!! Made fresh, not frozen, big portions, very tasty and reasonably priced.

Good good. Friendly service. Still haven't changed my mind the ice cream.< /Review>

Our first time here, delicious! Took little bit of time, but well worth it. The patties are hand formed, everything made fresh. Generous with the fries. A lady that I believe is the owner brought our meal over and checked on us throughout dinner. She was so nice! We'll definitely be back!< /Review>

4 Stars because the finished product is always picture perfect and consistently tastes the same.

My 3 Gripes.

1. I came here for breakfast once and at 8 in the morning, there was modern hip-hop/rap music playing talking about all sorts of derogatory and expletive things. Not something you should hear at a family business.

2. Get these workers some padded mats to stand on, standing stationary on hard tile will only fatigue employees.

3. EVERY time I come here just to grab some ice cream or a quick drink, even when there's only a total of 3 people in the building, I always get the "sorry for the wait" after being handed by drink/meal. Not sure if that's because of the work involved when crafting takes up so much time. But the last time I was here I waited just over 20 minutes for a smoothie.

It's a great place to grab a treat and take your family to visit when they travel from out of town. It's clean with a nice atmosphere. I enjoy coming here just to grab something and head out. But it's got a few areas that could use some improvement.< /text>

This place was great! My wife told me about it and we went to check it out. I didn’t know what “rolled ice cream” was but I do now!

They also have food which was pretty good. Great place that has hot food for when the weather is chilly outside and during the summer (which I’m excited about!) they have great options to cool you off. Their menu includes smoothies and teas. A great place to eat with the family, plenty of seating and great atmosphere!

I’m definitely telling friends and family about this place and can’t wait to go back!<//text>

As locals, we always check out the new establishments and our first impression was wow... each time my wife and I go, it gets better and better. Everything is fresh and delicious! Their soups are amazing! The Tiger Tea with boba is my favorite drink (many to choose from). To satisfy your sweet tooth, may I suggest one of their 'rolled ice cream' desserts. I had the 'Monkey Business' (banana & chocolate) on a waffle cone. The owners are really friendly and are more than willing to help go over their menu with you. They also have a pretty nifty rewards system for return customers, after a couple meals I've already earned $10 off my next order... So that ends my review of Chyll... I'm off to go get my tea!</review>

<Text>First off, great ice cream and drinks. As far as food is concerned there is not many options for kids.  My kids are great eaters and most options were spicy or had lots of seasoning. Another concern is the lack care with peanuts.  Peanuts were haphazardly added to a sauce and ended up all over items on the plate. My son the  couldn't eat those items due to be allergic. Will not come back for food due to these reasons.<//Text>< pictures>

Unfortunately this place offers nearly nothing vegetarian and there were no vegan food options. Also they do not offer table service and the food is quite over priced. However this place looks amazing! Excellent decorating and a beautifull creative atmosphere.</review>

Went here during the soft opening, 13th of February 2019. The service was great and the employees were very friendly and helpful explaining items and answering questions. Got the Firecracker ice cream and a vietnamese coffee. The ice cream was good, but the vietnamese coffee was very weak, like it wasn't brewed properly. I'll chalk that coffee up to the soft opening. I look forward to visiting this place again and trying their full menu!< /Text>

This place has rolled ice cream, boba, appetizers, lunch, some dinner items and breakfast until 11 am. I hope they stick around because very few places make it in Castaic. I'm not sure if they offer WIFI, but I may make this my study spot if they do.

UPDATE:
I visited again a couple weeks later and picked up some boba. The Boba was disgusting to be quite honest. It was dried out boba. My daughter and I both threw away our drinks.< /Review><Date>1561356643234</Date></record>

The chicken I had was very good, until I found a hair cooked on top of it, gross. Also they serve salad with no dressing and for some reason, they have no dressing.</Review>

It was ok. At those prices, table service might help soothe customers, rather than counter service. Including tip, it was $25 for three spring rolls and the soup. And the handful of cliantro was an odd add to chicken wonton soup. The peanut sauce for the spring rolls had so many other things added that the peanut taste was far too muted.
However, the wontons in the soup were excellent and the broth (other than the cilantro,lol) was well-flavored.  The spring rolls were fresh, well assembled, and with the expected flavor palate. Employees were friendly and prompt. We will likely give it another shot.<//Text>

Great place we found while driving by. Very clean restrooms but the tables and decor can use some upgrade. Our table had pits in the and the their broke siding. We loved their sushi and miso soup. We had one of the chefs special and a tempura plate. Both were great dishes and good presentation.</review>

Delicious sushi at reasonable prices. Total win.

Update- Second trip was just as great as the first! Best quality sushi I've had. They serve unique and delicious fish/veggie combinations. Worth the price and the trip< /text>

Good place to eat. The fatty Salmon was good. Very large dinner bento box. However I got sick after a few hours after eating here. It’s ok. As pong as I didn’t end up in the hospital I’m good.</text>

They also dont hover over you with the check so you can actually relax and enjoy your food.  Thank you for the amazing service</Text>< Pictures>

<text>I been coming here for many years and I think it's still my favorite. I have tried many places but I think the fish is the most fresh. The only thing I feel is kind of odd is that after coming here for so long that the owners don't build a relationship with the customers. I have been to other places and the owners know me I go in quit often. I try to come here 2- 3 times a month. I have taken many people here. They do give you freebies once in a while.  I recommend it.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNH8Kqil1RcKmTLta_AOsjrcl6Ke1VdlCFHmoY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNwFwEDgE3UjTmCGMVwsWGBhlyyK-ot7wEXPJE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< response>

<review>Rolling Sushi will always be my goto restauraunt to sit down, relax, drink a good cup of tea, and eat the best sushi of the Inland Empire. The food choices are delicious and the atmosphere is calm. The waiters are always attentive and their effort shows. The chefs have skill and are friendly to their customers. If you ever want healthy, delicious food, come to Rolling Sushi, you will never be disappointed. (Photos shown: Mochi, Sashimi, Scallop Sushi)<//review>< userid>

<Text>With so many different sushi places to visit, it is hard to pick just one favorite spot, but this is the place I visit the most for Sushi, it is always fresh, its tasty, and well made. Prices are average. My sister and I eat there and for less than $80 we have eaten our hearts out of sushi, rolls, edamame, Asian beer, and green tea...service is hit and miss. but it located right off the 15 Fwy on Foothill Blvd, next to that great BIG Beautiful Catholic Church, you can eat and know that you are ever so close to HOLY Ground, its a good place! Enjoy!< /Text>< Pictures>

Food was super yummy! It was exactly what we were looking for. Def a good place if you want some quality basic sushi. Lost a start because service was a little lacking, there was only one other group there and they forgot to bring us utensils. But they were friendly and quick.</text>

This place used to be my favorite place to get sushi. Now the foods have gone so badly. They swapped all the good chefs out. Took them 30 minutes to do a dragon roll. And we sit at the bar waiting for them without food< /Review>

For the service it gets 1 star. I have been going there from the time they first opened up and never have I had service like this afternoon. They were a younger staff working and seemed to care more to chat with each other than to help and service customers. Just Horrible.< /text>< pictures>

My wife and I had been searching for a good sushi place and after trying many this is now our go to when we are craving sushi. We usually order for pick up however I occasionally we eat in and it's happened a couple times where they have us try something for free and I end up loving it. That's how I discovered tempura chili peppers that I love. They have ran out of avocado and asked if we wanted to wait, we didn't because it was too long of a wait and they didn't discount anything which was disappointing but overall it's a good place.< /Text>

<Review>Update
This is a different place now, main chef is not there, the real welcome not there anymore, even the background music is gone. Rolls are the same but with no new introductions. It feels as a regular Sushi place without anything special going for it, really sad, it used to be one of the gems of Rancho now is just a another mediocre Sushi restaurant...

Best sushi in the area! Small but well worth the wait if packed. This is one of those places you'll call "your place"  to eat sushi.< /Review><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80c34a16e6e206eb:0x879abc068483afbf</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Delicious food.. We had to wait about 20 mins. But it was worth it. Although its a Small place but the food made it worth every penny.  Big plates for kids and adults. I give them a 5 star. And we got 2 free appetizers for waiting for our food.<//review>

Love the sushi and the beer. Staff was friendly and assisted often. Didn't like that my Coke came in a can with a cup of ice but that is just my preference. Everything was fresh and tasted great. The only thing was, one of my sushi rolls was coming undone and that's  ever happened to me before...< /Text>

Not sure what happened to this place but it was one of my favorites.

I placed an order for pick up, was told it would be an hour. I showed up 30 minutes later and my order was already sitting out. No one called to let me know it was done sooner.

The rolls were visually unappealing and dull in color. The rice tasted a day or two old!

When I asked for more wasabi they were rude and were hesitant to give me more. My order was $63 two wasabi wasn’t enough!

We won’t be going back ☹️< /Text>

This place is the best! The dynamite appetizer is my absolute favorite and the scallop lovers roll is amazing. The best is when they send over a little appetizer. Their fried shishito peppers are always the treat I cross my fingers for! Andy the owner is super friendly and will always remember your name.< /review>

The service was great, I felt very taken care of. The wait for my rolls wasn't too long, and the quality was good. The price was a little high, but the portions and roll sizes mostly make up for that. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I've gone to other places that are just to die for and that I can't live without, where here is a good place, but if asked where my FAVORITE place for sushi is, this placed missed that mark. That being said, if I'm craving sushi and am in the area, I would eat here again. Nothing negative to say, just not my #1 favorite place to go.< /Text>

The food is good but the waitress we had wasn't. It was close to closing time and she made sure everyone knew. She was complaining about the tip another table left her and how some other person had called out. I couldn't enjoy my food because I was uncomfortable. I understand that we as people get frustrated with the situation we're in but just go in the kitchen and vent where customers cant hear you. I believe we will come back to try it again because the food was good.<//text>

<review>This place had good food but they needed even take our order til 30 minuets in. And when they didn’t completely take my order our server had to come back multiple times to finish our order, plus all the workers was on their breaks, eating while serving. But totally not worth the price for the service they gave.</review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

The service was bland and the sushi was mediocre. But I wasn't really expecting too much out of this area.   The rolls here are quite expensive. Prepare to dish out a fair amount of money here.< /text>

Service was nonexistent. This place discriminated against our party because we had a "few" children. They refused to seat us even though they had many open tables. With all of the open tables we waited for 25 minutes then left. This was a horrible experience. Just shedding some light on our experience.<//Text>

<Review>This place wasn't my favorite. Some may enjoy this place, but personally, I'd rather pay more money and visit a place where I know I'll be satisfied.
I wasn't sold during my first visit.<//Review>< Pics>

<rating>1</rating><text>I used to LOVE this place. But just this past weekend my sister and I ate sushi from this place and we BOTH got food poisoning. I have been laying and bed sick to my stomach for the past 3 days because of it. And so has my sister. THEN to top it all off my stepfather went in (not for a refund, but to inform the management of the situation) and all they kept on saying was they would not give a refund unless they got a note from the doctor stating we got food poisoning. HE WAS NOT EVEN ASKING FOR A REFUND. Needless to say I will NEVER eat there again and I am extremely disappointed in the management for behaving in such a way. If I could give this place 0 stars I would.<//text>< pictures>

Three previous times I've received poor service. Then to top it off. I show up at 8:55pm, on a Wednesday, and they are not serving anymore. Take out only. How do you close over an hour before your sign says?! If your restaurant is supposed to be open till ten. Then stay open or change your hours! Never going back again!</review>

<Review>I live in Las Vegas and we have a good handful of Sushi restaurants here worth eating at - I have 1 favorite and about 5 that I would go to regularly. That being said, I am visiting family here in Rancho Cucamonga and decided to take the wife somewhere based off local reviews. I can say that if this is the best there is locally - its a wonder how this place is even open. Upon arrival we were not even greeted once by the 2 sushi chefs when we sat down - the 2 girls working in the front that were taking the orders for the sushi chefs for some reason had no clue how to answer any questions I was asking them about sashimi or sushi. I eventually told them I would just order from the chefs directly - except for one thing, that never happened since after about 10-15 more minutes the chefs never asked what we wanted.
Finally after just ordering from the hostess girls in front (sashimi plate, special rolls, spicy ponzu and 2 beers) they finally brought our order. The fish was pretty fresh which I do expect in SoCal, but the sauce for the rolls and the so called excuse for spicy ponzu was a weak effort to say the least. Maybe soy sauce with sriracha added? We finished our beers pretty quickly and waited and watched the hostess girls walk by us 10 times each never to ask if we wanted more drinks and never picked up our empty plates to ask if we wanted to order more. Needless to say there was maybe 10-15 people in the place at 6pm so there was no excuse. Tips and bills are ran up from good service...example being more alcohol to customers at a fast pace and clearing plates for more rolls to come in. Neither done in this case.

This cant be the best sushi in Rancho by any means - this place wouldnt last 3-6 months in Las Vegas without going out of business. I explained my concern to the hostess when we left since we were dis-satisfied, but she didnt seem to care much. Good luck with your business - will probably be a short run.<//Review>< pics>

<review>Company’s cornerstone is being a family oriented drive-in — NOT!
So... after church we drive over, long long drive-through line so I pull into a stall, press button and wait, and wait, and wait, and wait, and wait, and wait, and wait, and wait, and wait.
Then I try the app.
Errors out saying NO ahead app ordering at this location.
FINALLY, someone says through the speaker, “Sorry.  Only accepting drive-through orders.”  Then the speaker and mike obviously went dead.
NOW I am trapped in the stall since the drive-through lane is now behind me.
Had to beg people to let me out.
NEVER will I return to Hell On Earth.
If you can’t staff your business, put a sign outside and close.
Letting people sit in a hot outside stall without any warning or information is NOT COOL.</review>< Name>

30 minute wait just to order a milkshake. Clearly they’re short staffed, doing the best they can to keep up with the volume. Unacceptable on behalf of management. Should do better for customer service.<//Review>

So I hadn't been to Sonic's in forever and I see why. The only reason I'm giving them two stars was the shakes were good. Other then that you could get better food at the Arco gas station next door.
The tater tots which were my favorite last time I had gone, tasted like they had been sitting there all day, the mozzarella sticks didn't have the cheese melted and they gave me cheese sauce that was disturbing, it had no movement.
The only redeeming factor of the night was the shakes.< /Text>

<Review>I'm not really sure what was going on with this location today. Although í had great service  I noticed something odd occurring to others they we're pulling in to the stalls and then leaving quick. Something the employees on the speaker saying something was not available. I could not make it out as it was busy. Also all the stalls on the gas station side was wrapped with caution tape. Could not figure out why I did not notice anything being repaired. It definitely made it difficult to get out of the stalls when leaving. If you go bring your patience with you some drivers had road rage issues.</Review>< Gmap_id>

Ordered online through the app and had it for pickup 20 minutes since that was how long it would take me to get there. Drove in, checked into the stall, and waited for 15 minutes! Couldn’t wait any longer so i finally pushed the button. Finally someone came on and i told them how long i was waiting. Finally got my food after a minute like it was sitting there the whole time. Ridiculous for the wait time. All i ordered was one coney. Wasn’t even freshly hot when i received it. No apologies either for the late food. Ridiculous. Never coming back to this location.< /review>

Haven't been here for awhile and no drive in dining when I was there during orange tier. Only drive thru available but not a huge problem.
Huge selection of food, drinks, and dessert. Prices are not bad overall but can add up because of the temptation for a shake or slushie.
Ordered Coney Island Dog combo with tater tots and was good.
I would come here more often if it wasn't so far from my home. There should be more Sonic around.
I highly recommend this place for a quick bite and/or for the drinks.<//text>

Every Sonic I have been to takes at least 30 minutes to bring you your food. Not to mention how long it takes them to answer the red button after you push it. If you're in a hurry, just drive on by.< /text>

I ordered and before I knew it, Emily is already at my car with my order and the reason I am no longer avoiding Sonic when I am close by and hungry! She was nice and quick with orders and hopefully its not just the one on North Placentia but if it is ill stay in that area for Sonic!</review>< username>

< Review>
So I hadn't been to Sonic's in forever and I see why. The only reason I'm giving them two stars was the shakes were good. Other then that you could get better food at the Arco gas station next door.
The tater tots which were my favorite last time I had gone, tasted like they had been sitting there all day, the mozzarella sticks didn't have the cheese melted and they gave me cheese sauce that was disturbing, it had no movement.
The only redeeming factor of the night was the shakes.<//Review>

<review>Worst experience ever..
I ordered a sonic blast with m&m..
The girl was giving me this thing all melted dripping all over my car door..
She went back inside supposedly to bring me a new one..
For my surprise.. She just cleaned it up.. You could see he water on the lid and she cleaned the cup with water too.. It was gross..</review><rating>1</rating><date>1617837754734< /date>< Name>

<Text>UPDATE:
I was contacted almost immediately and asked to escalate my concerns so it would be taken care of. I'm sure it was an attempt to get me to remove the post or to show concern for the lack of cleanliness. I did contact them but they haven't responded as of this day. I tried folks, beware if you're concerned about the virus.

This was our first visit at this location. We decided to eat in the patio where you need to order via the menu box (same as the drive up). The gal couldn't hear us and kept repeating our order incorrectly. We had to ask for a table to be cleaned and the gentleman wiped it down with a wet towel that left a ton of water behind. We asked him to wipe it completely because he didn't clean the whole table. He said all that all tables were cleaned when the customers left. Not sure if you can see it in the photos but they weren't cleaned. There was an employee smoking a couple of tables away but nothing was said to her. Needless to say it wasn't a pleasant visit and I could see they have a good following. Much luck to them but I won't be back 👎</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM03Xn751gcJlbngGkg1WZVV9jHQ1Ljsg0TwMaP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOP4w6PnvKjEkUaWwBdZb2vLBWH9IAz9opw7IFg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><response>{'time': 1598367522166, 'text': "We're sorry to hear you had a negative experience with one of our locations.

Highly recommend just using the drive-thru if you're looking for reasonable service speeds.  When I parked in a car bay to order food here, from the time I pressed the red button to the time the staff acknowledged me was almost 15 minutes.  This has been my experience multiple times.

Food is pretty consistent with other Sonic locations but this location gets 2 stars for the very poor service and customer experience.<//review>

Seriously disappointed in my experience today.
I had to repeat my order multiple times through a very grainy speaker, correcting the order taker every time.
So, we get to the window, and we had to go over the order AGAIN,  with a   different person ,because they got it wrong.  We finally get our food and check to make sure it is all there, according to the reciept we ordered honey bbq wings and the rest was correct. We get home, they messed up the wings, buffalo instead of bbq, and the rest of the food was prepared subpar.  That was 2 people we spoke to and the order was still incorrect. It wasn't even during the lunch rush. I don't expect much from fast food, but this was disappointing, seeing that we have never had issues with this location before. So sad because I enjoy eating Sonic.<//text>

<username>Kenneth Lin< /username><date>1605651949492<//date><Rating>1< /Rating><Review>Order took 40 minutes. Supposedly someone else took my food. I was chatting with my friend, so I wasn't too worried. At the 35 minute mark, I had to ask them about it. The lady said she saw me just sitting there, but didn't think to ask about my order. 🤦‍♂️She was polite, and said "sorry"... But I really thought I should have gotten it for free/refund. If I wasn't trying to get somewhere, I would have brought out the inner Karen. By the time I got home, my food was cold. Driving back to sternly speak to someone wasn't worth my time. So I'm ranting about it on this platform... I need to rethink my life.</Review>< Pics>

My partner and I waited over a half hour in line in the drive thru, no one responded in the box when we were suppose to place the order. We go to the window and tell the cashier that no one helped us with our order and she said “we only have one person here, can you get back in line to place your order.” ??? What am I missing here? Sonic was our favorite place to go to but after this we are not coming back. Very disappointed.< /Text>

Service is EXTREMELY slow if you do drive in. I watched as the drive through line went through at least 20 cars before I got my order delivered to the car. It's clear they prioritize drive through over drive in. Food is just OK, everything is just very plain.< /review>

Well, I went to the pull in drive-thru, and was left for 30-minutes unattended. So we went to the actual drive-thru, and was left for 15-minutes unattended.

Finally pulled up to the window and was asked "oh, did nobody help you?"

I won't be coming back.< /review>

Update: I gave them one last shot to see if this is a franchise I could enjoy. I don’t know how many times I said “Grilled Chicken Sandwich ”. I was given this tiny classic sandwich with pickles. I am forced to conclude that the workers at this location are just straight up rude and incompetent. Will not be returning.

Previous Review:

I have been to this location on three separate occasions. They have had mistakes all 3 times. When you ask them to correct the issue, they treat you like an inconvenience. Today I had a window slammed when I ordered a blue raspberry tea and they gave me a regular. Just asked for the correct beverage and a male team member handed it to me without a word and slammed the window shut.< /Text>

<Review>The manager Jazz was extremely rude to us, we were waiting at the car hop for 30 minutes with the button pushed, they finally responded and said the stalls are closed, the whole time we were waiting, we could have gone through drive thru. When we finally got to the window, we asked her what time the stalls closed because we were waiting for them to respond for a half hour and she said at 11. I told her it didn’t say anywhere that the stalls closed at 11 and if we knew that we would have just went through drive thru instead of waiting for 30 minutes for them to tell us that they were closed, she rolled her eyes and said nothing. She is extremely rude and need to be retrained by management at the least, if not removed of her managerial duties. If she can’t handle a few car stops how is she supposed to manage the whole restaurant.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Text>I'd give it a zero if I could. We waited over 40 mins and were never served. We kept being told they were backed up, but every car that arrived after us received their order and the drive thru kept moving. All while three employees including the manager sat outside on their break. We finally requested a refund and did not even receive an apology. Worst experience ever.</Text></record>

Waited for 30 minutes and they never brought our food out so we eventually had to leave with no food. Drove way out here to have lunch with my girlfriend and it was a complete mess and waste of time. They still charged me though!<//Text>

Quality you would expect from Sonic however the worst customer service experience. Had to ask about an allergy concern and they seemed to not understand the question. One of our drinks did not have any ice and if it had been made with ice it sat there long enough for it to melt. We weren't offered condiments when our order came and had to ask twice before we received any. Would have given more stars had they staff been a little more in their game.< /review>

Tator tots and chicken fingers. Bacon double cheeseburger and fries. Cherry limeade yummy. Love the root beer floats. Good food, good service(they have car hops), good prices. Where can you get a meal for $10 with a drink included. Very pleasant service people!</review>

I'm a big fan of this Sonic. The service was fast and polite. My burger was very good and their new Custard Concretes are great! I recommend coming here during the week when business is more open.< /review>

I've visited this establishment on various occasion. Their drive in service is well worth it. The properties are kept clean. Customer service no wait at all. The food quality I give it a 3 out of 5 stars. All the items I ordered were brought in a fast timely matter. Restroom quality can be improved I found myself without soap in the dispenser only hand purifier.</Text>

Whether it was an isolated incident, or the time of night, 11pm or so, but if you come here, you better not have any plans or be in a rush, the sign that says your food is ready and someone will be out, is highly inaccurate, as my order was delayed over 20 minutes after it said it was being delivered to my car waiting in the stall.< /Review>

It's okay to run out of ingredients - it's not okay to substitute lime syrup for actual limes in a flipping limeade (especially without asking). Rude, rude young lady.<//review>

Wow!  Super quick!  New management?  Excellent shakes as always, right now 1/2 off after 8:00 PM  during the Summer season.  A new Strawberry Daiquiri Slush was really good too with real strawberries blended in.  Along with a small onion rings, the small Strawberry Daiquiri Slush and a large Hot Fudge, Peanut Butter shake (like drinking a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup with vanilla ice cream...pure Heaven on Earth) cost $6 after 8:00 PM.<//review>

Love the convenience, but the food is strictly average or lower.  We ordered two foot longs and the chili was not great.  We came here because the in n out across the street didn't have a drive thru.<//Text>

<text>My local sonic is a disappointment. They mix up orders and bring out the wrong thing first almost EVERY time in my experience, and they make you wait forever for it. What’s worse is that they close out the order on your screen so their times look better, which in reality makes the order take twice as long to get to you. I swear they forget half the time and you have to press the button to remind them!

I looove sonic and I’m sure the workers at this particular one are just overworked, but it’s sad that I literally pass this sonic now (2 minutes from home) to go to the one near Orangethorpe because the service is just better.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Name>

<review>Charlie is the man! This place is always my go to for slushies. Today I went to get my RT44 Blue Raspberry slushie as normal when I got there I decided I was also hungry so I ordered the buffalo wings. I pulled up to the window and Charlie had the best personality ever! He was so happy and relatable. He asked me if I wanted ranch and when I said yes he said I knew you would girl cause I would want some too! He hooked it up with the ranch. Thanks for being you Charlie even in these hard times.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

To be honest, this establishment is utterly garbage. How long does it truly take for a serve to bring four shakes out. Four. Nonetheless she told be there's dozens waiting so it is "busy". Well sorry miss but this seems to not be the job for you, nor any of them there. Would be best if it just closed and reopened with new staff.</Text>

The slushies are really the only reason I go here they taste amazing. The food is good but the slushiest are where it's at. Also the way the stalls work is just the best, I wish a lot of fast food chains would do it this way.</text>

Kaleb was cool. He's the reason it isn't 1 star. Alexis, though, rushed the order asking like 5 times if it was our final order when it clearly wasn't, since we kept asking for an additional drink, didn't know that Tea could have Peach flavoring, and added ¢60 for nerds to our order of Cherry Limeade Slush. However, the Cherry Limeade Slush also turned out to be a Cherry Slush with ¢50 lime added. Maybe that just is what the Cherry Limeade Slush is, but it tasted worse than the last time I had it a few months back. Kaleb is cool.< /text>

Terrible customer service.  I pulled up for in car service and was told they'd help me please wait.  As I saw other cars pull into stall near me I noticed they were placing orders right away.  Even servers passed by my car and didnt help.  15 minutes later I finally decided to leave and as I was pulling out they finally came on the intercom...<//Text>

<name>Micki Ireland</name><Resp>None<//Resp><Review>I loved the Sonic in OK, near Fort Sill;  I like the Sonic in Anaheim;  but I will probably never return to the Sonic in Fullerton!  I waited over 20 minutes after pushing the service button; after seeing cars that arrived after I pushed the button drive off with their orders, I pushed the button a second time.  They finally answered the call.  I ordered a BLT Chicken sandwich plus Tater Tots.  It took another 15 minutes to get a luke-warm sandwich with a bottom bun that was stiffer than cardboard (before unwrapping it, I thought it was in a cardboard sleeve).  I ate the “sandwich” with half a bun.  The chicken was dry; there was 1 small (maybe 1/4 piece of bacon); mozzarella cheese was unnoticeable.   The Tater Tots were perfectly cooked (the reason for the 2 stars).

If you want Sonic, drive the extra amount to the Anaheim store, where you can get much better service, and a better sandwich!</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>The food was just typical of a fast-food restaurant. Unfortunately once you get your order you can't  get any other service from the staff. Need condiments? May as well go to the supermarket to get them... We eat out every day but only go here when craving an ice cold cherry slush!</Review>< Date>

Needed to make a snap decision about what I wanted to eat right there at the window. I suggest they take down the promo signs for items they no longer sell to avoid this in the future.

Went through the drive thru and everything was great! Got a kids meal for my son and I got a number 7. Everything was tasty and the woman at the window was super friendly. I unfortunately cannot remember her name but I want to say that it started with an S. Hopefully that's right!<//Text>

<text>AMAZING SLUSHIES AND SHAKES. I always try to stop at sonics whenever i drive near it. I don't mind getting off the highway and back on for the drinks here. Obviously the food is like any other sonics however, the service is great and they were pretty good at delivering the food fairly quickly. From my experiences, I've never had to argue with any of the workers. The slushies and shakes, as stated before, are amazing, you have to try any one of them. I'm on a mission to try them all and so far so good. Make sure to drop by and give them a shot next time you are in the area.

Absolutely delicious! Better than we anticipated it to be. I just don't recommend going there when the temperature is in the 50's and ideally your supposed to keep the windows of your car rolled down so that you can enjoy their retro-music.<//Review>

Standard Sonic. Food is good here. Though this time when ordering a classic chicken sandwich I got no lettuce or tomato. That was annoying. Otherwise all other visits have been fine. Service is average. Location is nice in that there are plenty of spaces. If you are going to Sonic, this one is a good one, would come again.<//Review>

Got there a little late so only the drive-thru was open I didn't know, the website said it closes at 2AM. Stood in line for over 5 minutes until a young lady brought out our order.  The burger and mozzarella sticks i got were salty but my son's shake was delicious.<//Text>

<review>Sonic Drive-In is one of my all-time favorite places and it's really disappointing when the restaurant not only does not honor a promotion, it also ignores a complaint filed with corporate. On Tuesday nights it is supposed to be family night it's half-price burgers until closing time and this location does not honor the ad posted on their own menu.I will return to Sonic Drive-In but not in the state of California only in the Midwest where they know how to treat people.<//review><GmapID>0x80dcd5d4bc479969:0x3bd68122a85343b8</GmapID><Name>Joshua York</Name>< resp>

I love sonic but this one disappoints everytime, I will never order hot food from here again, the last burger I got was room temperature and one edge, about 1/4 was very dry, hard, visible different from the rest of the patty. When they first opened they were amazing but the past few year I've never had a good meal here. The only thing I would order from here is ice cream.< /Text>

<review>Good service and food late on a Sunday. Only complaint was the flavored shakes weren't blended well. The caramel one, for example, had a clump of caramel starting about 2/3rds of the way down. So there it tasted like it was supposed to, but before that it was just a vanilla shake. We had four in our irder, all different flavors, like that. And it wasn't BAD - just disappointing. Otherwise, our visit was good.<//review>< pics>

Food is decent for the price.. about what you'd expect. I'd say 4 stars because service is very friendly. Just understand you're not expecting a 4-5 star dining experience, right? It's grub! 😋<//Review>

Our shakes were warm and runny. They were the worst shakes I have ever had here at Sonic.  The food was very. Greasy and ended up throwing it all away.</text>

First of all this branch needs a lot of work and retrain all the staff .
I work for sonic and I never ever had this worse services. Visiting this branch was a waste of my time. Little advices hopefully you take some action to fix this flaws asap.

1. Customer Service is a key
2. T.N.T.  ( Today not Tomorrow )
3. Check your ingredients on how to make the right slush floats and  other ice cream mix.
4. Know your sizes with your combo meal, if they want to up size it for 2$ more. Honesty is a good way to go.
5. Always hand Customers a clean and none sticky drinks in there hands.
6. It does not hurt to SMILE and say THANK YOU !

Hopefully my third visit won't be another disappointment.</text>

My server was great, but the food quality was not excellent.  I ordered chicken strips and they were not fresh, but lukewarm.  I expect better quality especially when the cost for 3 chicken strips is $5 Bucks.<//text>

Food was good, but not prepared for each car till they reached the window=long wait. Also, the cashier had long loose curley hair and I witnessed her eating from the tray... Yuck!

Service was slow I ordered ahead and still waited 15 minutes in drive thru with 1 car ahead of me. The employees were just walking around or standing around with no sense of urgency. The shake was good though so 2 stars< /Review>

<text>This Sonics is awesome! Every time I go (almost every clay on my Way home from work) I alway  order the 44 02 Blackberry Slush. Thats the flavor Im stuck on right now! I've never had a bad experience here and all of the employee's I've encountered have been nothing but polite and friendly infact I've never been greeted with anything but smiles! This place and everyone who works there are the best! Alexis is one of the guys who works the cash register... and he has a great smile!</text>< Gmap_id>

Love me some happy hours. $.99 large drinks before 10 AM, 1/2 priced drinks 2-5, and 1/2 shakes after 8 PM.

It must be said I have a small Sonic addiction.. I will always get my drinks and slushies from Sonic.< /Text>

I ordered just 2 sides at one of their stalls, and it literally took 30 minutes for them to get me my food. I had to ask the worker 3 times when my food was coming. I will probably not go to Sonics agai. Due to the terrible timeliness of their 'fast food'< /Text>

You can park on either side of the restaurant or go in the drive-thru line. They have an endless menu of slushies and several specials during the week. Kids menu is also available (grilled cheese, hot dog, chicken fingers to name a few). I would love to see the menu expanded (thus the 4 star review). Service was great and it was easy to order and pay. You can pay cash, credit/debit or even through the app. Download the app for special coupon!<//review>

First of all this branch needs a lot of work and retrain all the staff .
I work for sonic and I never ever had this worse services. Visiting this branch was a waste of my time. Little advices hopefully you take some action to fix this flaws asap.

1. Customer Service is a key
2. T.N.T.  ( Today not Tomorrow )
3. Check your ingredients on how to make the right slush floats and  other ice cream mix.
4. Know your sizes with your combo meal, if they want to up size it for 2$ more. Honesty is a good way to go.
5. Always hand Customers a clean and none sticky drinks in there hands.
6. It does not hurt to SMILE and say THANK YOU !

Hopefully my third visit won't be another disappointment.</review>

Came by the other day and tried the new Kings Hawaiian burger and got a wings combo, but realized once I got home that I was charged for two combos and my burger had no meat or cheese! When I went back to get a new burger and a refund for the 2nd combo, the lead or manager that was there was being super condescending like I didnt know what I had ordered, and had a very rude tone and would constantly cut me off. After I got the refund they didnt even give me a new replacement burger until I reminded them. Very unnecessary headache and not what I wanted to deal with at all! If you want Sonic go to the other one in Anaheim, very poor staff here at Fullerton.</Text></record>

The girl that helped me was very helpful and apologetic when she had me waiting for about 10-12 min. She didn't know how to make my shake properly. It came out very good though. I just hate the fact 4 out of 5 times I go I have to wait 10-20 min  for my order in the drive - thru. I like the food but the help is usually very slow and not friendly.</Review>

I've been waiting 90 minutes for a simple double burger. Still no service. I'm off to the In-n-Out across the street to get something to eat. Order your food a week in advance here. Then you might only have to wait an hour.<//Review>

< review>
The app needs to be redesigned so the UI is more user friendly. That aside I work in customer service and business management so I understand how difficult customers can be AND the importance of making the customer experience the best it can be even when it's busy. I have been to 3 locations in the area recently and ALL have failed but this time was the worst. We didn't get our simple 2 shake order for over an hour and I was very kind because I know how it is to be treated badly by customers but the manager didn't act nor say sorry and the shakes were not correct and weren't even cold. I had to check in twice on the app and press the red button 3 times. It goes without saying that I will not go back to this Sonic until changes are made even though it's the closest. I'm not sure I'll ever use the app again because at all 3 locations they seem to ignore app orders... I have watched the screens state it's on it's way then go back to the standby screen and I have had to press the red button and wait again for my order and it still takes more then 15minutes... inexcusable.<//review>

Either this is the worse sonic location there is or they're all terrible. They first got the order wrong and never confirmed with us at the drive through. They messed up the order when we checked after we received our food. Safe to say, I DO NOT RECOMMEND SONICS.< /text>

< Review>
Sat in my car waiting more than 30 minutes after ordering two drinks. Cars on either side of me got their orders, ate, and left before anyone approached my car. Got out and complained. They supposedly checked my order, made my drinks, and gave them to me for free. Polite enough... but I still got the wrong drinks! I just left.

First time I had food from this place and it wasn't too shabby. They offer a couple of free add on to your hamburger and if you don't mind eating in your car then you will like this place.< /Text>

They are so slow just to take your order. Food is not hot and the server forgets to bring basic things like straws, napkins and condiments like ketchup. It's themed like the 50's & 60's drive in diner's where servers were on rollerskates and you eat in your car. You'd expect they would have trash cans nearby so motorists can dispose of burger wrappers, cups and all the containers your food came in but they don't, there was only two trash cans, one on each side. So, of course, there is trash all over the parking lot. I would not recommend Sonic and I would not go back but my girlfriend likes it because shakes are 1/2 price after 8pm......lol.....I'm serious. I love my girl so I suffer through the madness but at least I go after 8pm to get half-priced shakes and half warm food.< /review>

<review>Long wait. They obviously had a problem that day. I just wanted a cherry lime-ade really bad after a tiring work day. The lady who took my order seemed surprised that I just wanted a soda, and somewhere in the time it would take to order one soda, she thought I said two sodas. I tried to correct her but kept getting cut off. So what, I thought, I'll just tell them I only wanted one when I get to the window. Waiting now for some time, and zoning out because I was really tried from work, I noticed three cars behind me left while in line. I waited approximately 20-30min with only one car ahead for a soda. When I got to the window, I told the lady I just wanted one, and she looked at me as if this was a problem for her. She said she had to get the manager. So, after about a minute, the manager came to void the original transaction, I guess, and then left the cashier to finish with the rest. The manager said nothing about the wait, appeared to just not care about her business at all. Same with the Cashier. So, this place sucks. I would recommend to avoid this place if you can. I certainly will.< /review><Rating>1</Rating><user_name>John Faire< /user_name><UserId.>109984167406445802629<//UserId.>< pictures>

45 minutes in the drive through...at midnight. That's pretty pathetic. This definitely does not qualify as fast food. And all for a burrito and mozzarella sticks. Last time I go through the drive thru here. It's now 1 am.< /review>

The shake wasn't that great, and the service was meh. There's a screen for drive up orders and it notifies you when your order is going to be delivered to your car. I waited ten minutes after that notification to ask where my for was and suddenly it was delivered 2 minutes later.</text>

Employees are extremely rude. After waiting 45 minutes for ONE shake, the employee yelled at my mom and gave her a melted shake. I've only had bad experiences at this location (long waits and gross food) and I think this last time has done it for me. I can't believe this location is able to stay open the way it is. Get it together.<//Review>

<text>By far the worst Sonic in orange county. I wouldn't normally bother leaving a review for a fast food place but these guys are just comically bad. 3 cars in the drive through? 20 minute wait. Ordered 4 or 5 drinks? 2-3 will be blatantly wrong. Never had a problem with the other ones in the area it really is just this one.<//text>< Date>

I was disappointed in my experience after having been excited to find a Sonic.  I used to go to Sonic a LOT in Oklahoma and Texas.  This visit here was a personal let-down.  After this visit, I didn't care to ever go back. I still feel this way months afterward.  Kinda sad.  Food wasn't tasty, the drive-thru employee wasn't courteous, my order wasn't correct and after not finishing my meal I went back through the drive thru to get a dessert.  They said I wasn't able to order the dessert I wanted because they were about to close. (It was at least 15 minutes prior to closing time.) I didn't enjoy my visit.< /Review>

Horrible service be prepared to wait a long time for your food also make sure you check your food and make sure it's right. Most of the employees are not very friendly I understand the majority of them are high school kids but they need to be trained correctly. If my employees worked like this I would be out of business. Get it right Sonic !  calling the 800 number now< /review>

<text>I ordered their boneless wings with thai sweet chili sauce - when I received them, they were covered in buffalo sauce. I also ordered a kids corn dog and asked for ketchup - no ketchup in the bag. These were both things that were read off to me before handing me the food, so I thought everything would be fine. No. Thankfully my niece ate the corn dog plain. My other half got the bbq drenched chicken sandwich and said it wasn't very good. This is only my second experience at this sonic but I'm definitely not going to rush back.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Review>Horrible choice for breakfast. Wouldn't let us use the restroom because they "just mopped and it was a safety issue" eggs were so thin and dry I couldn't even finish my meal.
Didn't have the original items I wanted. Everything took forever and was definitely not worth it at all.</Review>< pictures>

Food is good, but sloooowest service ever.  Once I waited for over 5 minutes after pushing the order button and no one answered so I left.   Tonight, my small and simple order took 15 minutes to come out and arrived cold.</Review>

I love the chocolate shakes  at Sonic. ...but the service really sucks..the employees need to be trained in customer service  and be faster. I went to the drive thru in North Placentia in Fullerton ca.  On August 30th in the evening.  Next time I'll just ordered the shakes and go across the street to " In N Out".< /Review>

Went to Sonic, got a chicken sandwich from the value menu. It costs $1.59
Went to McDonald's, grabbed a McChicken for $1.
My husband and I did a side by side comparison. The McChicken was much better. Like, way way better. Like, looking at a computer screen wallpaper of a tropical island, stuck in a dingy cubical, verses spending a summer combing the beaches of the carribean.
Moral of the story: go to Sonic for the half priced milkshakes after 8pm if you feel like consuming that many calories. Skip the overpriced food.

3 stars cause roller skating.</text>

Had a great time. Don't bother with the drive thru. Download that Sonic app and get half off on a medium shake sheet you pull up at one of the stalls.b Get the pretzel and cheese for a couple bucks and ask'em to warm the cheese and your good to go! Trust me bro! Cheesecake-Butterfinger-Snickers-Recees shake with vanilla ice cream*< /Review>

I waited to order at the stall for over 10minutes. While the stall next to me serve 2 different customers. The staff would get on the intercom and say "just 1 minute". Awful service.  I even asked an employee how much longer would I need to wait since I have been here waiting for 10 minutes. She said that someone will help me soon< /text>

<review>Last week I stopped here to get iced coffee. I came through the drive-thru and ordered several drinks during their morning drink promotion, which is heavily advertised. Despite these advertisements I was charged full price. I let the employee know that the signs say the drinks are discounted until 10am, so she reluctantly changed the prices. I drove away and when I tasted my coffee it was 100% cream. No coffee. I was already on the freeway so I chalked it up as a loss.
2 weeks later I made the mistake of returning around the same time, but this time I ordered  different beverages. I was still charged full price during the promotional hours. The same employee was working the window, but this time there was someone else with her. So I again pointed out the discrepancy. The other employee changed the price for me while the reluctant one went out to read the sign, because she seemed to once again think I was wrong.
No discount is really worth the headache. I probably won't stop here again even though it's convenient with my commute.<//review>< Response>

My family and I had been at Disneyland all day so we were exhausted and we decided Sonic for the quick bite lol. So we didn't pay that much attention when the waitress handed us our food we were shorted a hamburger and instead of the regular all American hotdog my 8 year old got like Verde sauce or something IDK it was definitely a little spicy and way too spicy for him.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

We want to confirm this wasn't the store in Anaheim, as we do not carry a verde sauce. Regardless, we want you to know that we take your comments very seriously, and will be discussing with our crew to make sure speed of service is brought to the attention of the staff. If you would like to further discuss, please call 949-680-4302. We appreciate your business and do hope we can serve you again in the future!\nSonic Management"}<//Resp>

<Review>Drive thru service is slow, we ordered and we had about 5 other cars in front. It took a while to get to the window. When we did get to the window, they tried giving me the order for the car behind me, then she gave me my shakes, but I had to wait for my food, the car behind me got there order before I got mine. What about making them wait like I had to and let's service the person at the drive thru window first. Very slow service and no organization what's so ever. Plus I had my 8 month old crying because he wanted to sleep and the vehicle wasn't moving. But the shakes and good were good. Its just the service that needs work.</Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Waited at the drive thru menu board for three minutes without any response. There were three other cars in line for the pickup window, so they appeared to order just fine. I gave up and went next door to El Pollo Loco instead.</Text>

Waited 10 min to get our order taken just to have the worker greet us and then go dark. Literally nothing. Pressed button again and waited another 15 min to order. Ordered 2 shakes and 2 pretzels. Not very complicated. Then we waited 15 min for our "carhop to be on their way" never came. Waited 10 min for our order to be delievered after waiting 15 for it to be made and who knows how long to actually get our order in. I understand their drive thru was crowded but that doesnt mean the service for the drive ins should be lacking. Won't go back to that one sticking to the one on lemon and orangethorpe<//Text>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><review>Can I give less than a star , first experience was a breaded chicken sandwich,  Cold ,tough chicken , obviously made before I  ordered it , then  warm wilted fries and  a soda cup full of ice , had to order from the next door jack in the box to have a better taste left in my mouth . Then , more than a month later , I figure that I'll try again and got a cheese burger ,  it wad just plain disappointing , no flavor to speak of . I think that the only thing that I liked was the sliced pickle , and I  felt cheated for the price ,
Never  again .<//review>< Rate>

Just took my kids to see the neighborhood that I grew up and never even knew there was a Sonic here will I go back most likely not I give it one star.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Was waiting at the Anaheim Sonic on. Friday night for 15 minutes before leaving because no one was answering. Came to the Fullerton one and waited 5 minutes at a stall before a lady told me over the speakers that only the drive thru is open. Went to the drive thru. I've been waiting for 20 minutes. This place is just as poorly managed as the Anaheim Sonic. Suggestions:
1) A simple message on the stalls informing customers that only the drive thru is open.
2) Hire more kitchen help ! Service is extremely slow.

I will inform Oklahoma Sonic headquarters that their brand identity is suffering due to poorly run Sonics like this one.< /Text><rate>1</rate><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

I went through the drive thru and told them I've been waiting so they brought out my order which was cold by thia time and thw snobby brat told me she ignored my order because there was no receipt. Very horrible service!!!</Text>< pics>

This place is the worst!!! The worker was Rude!!! My total was 25.22. I paid with two $20. bills she handed me my change and says I dont have .78 cents ok? I assumed she rounded my change UP & just gave me $15. Like most places do but NO she gave me $14. Yeah its just .78 but wow who does that to their customers!!! On top of that the tots were soggy!! Plus they weren't serving icecream. The signs and even the receipt says full menu all day! I'll NEVER go back to sonic!!< /Review>

If we order 8 drinks, 2 cones, and ask for 2 cup holders why would you not bring the drinks out in said cupholders and instead try to hand us 8 drinks individually while the cones melt and you have to go back for the cupholders.  Do you really think there were 8 people in our car?  Also thanks for NOT giving us the Splenda.<//review>

<review>Terrible. Screen was broken but they said they could still take my order via mic. Never been there before. Thought it was fast food place. Took 15 minutes to get my order. And another 5 to get my cheese sticks. Came cold. And had to wait an additional 5 minutes for our 2 small shakes! No good. I can't recommend this place. They said it took so long because the customer before me had a large order! What? You can only make one shake at a time? Lame. I'd give a ZERO STARS if I could. Never been there before. Never will go back.< /review><username>Gr8 Rome</username><Pics>None<//Pics>< Gmap_id>

Horrible Management. I used to work here, dont eat here 100% unsanitary and abusive and rude managers (Andrew, Sergio, and Manny Gochicoa) They fired me due to "uniform issues" no because i made it explicitly clear of the food safety guidelines that they ignore on a d
aily basis. The grill is always black, the fryers are never filtered and there are cockroaches infested. TERMINIX comes evwry month. The GM Manny Gochicoa has made perverse remarks to several employees. I fear of saying who because they could lose ther jobs. The management has been harrasing me since ive left. The only good managers there are Auxavier and Veronica, when theyre running things its always smooth sailing.< /Review>

Usually I like Sonic, but for some reason tonight was exceptionally awful

I ordered a pretzel dog with cheese and bacon, which was okay

But the sole reason I actually went there, was because I wanted a blue raspberry nerds slushie, I got the slushie, but there are no nerds in it! i'm finishing it right now hoping maybe they're all caught somewhere in the middle and it wasn't blended or something, but i'm losing faith as i get closer to the bottom of the cup and still see and taste NO NERDS!

My girlfriend wanted tater tots and a grilled cheese, I told her the tater tots are bomb, because they usually are, and i told her additionally, you really can't mess up grilled cheese.

Well now my girlfriend thinks i'm an idiot, because the tater tots were unsalted and not hot, and the grilled cheese was straight up slightly melted american cheese between two squishy ass pieces of NOT HOT white bread, so basically a kind of melted cheese sandwich, definitely no grilled in there, no butter on the outside of the bread, like how do you even do that...

it's like ordering a cheese burger and getting a mcchicken, just bland and not quite right.

So now my girlfriend is making me sit through the drive thru at the mcdonalds across the street, which is terrible to ever go to since it's way too damn small for the amount of people that want to go there, thanks to the in n out across from it not having a drive thru and the other nearby restaurants being expensive and not that good

Yeah i'm talking to you El Pollo Loco...fml</Review>

To them, drive-thru is their priority.<//Review>< name>

So we finally get everything right, drive home, realize my banana shake was not blended, just vanilla ice cream with a pile of bananas at the bottom. This was rediculous, Ive worked fast food so i try to cut them some slack, but this was the most confusing and difficult time i think ive ever had trying to get food. And it seems so strange someone who doesnt work there is bringing out the food??? WTF, I keep calling today but no1 answers, will seek money back.</text>< Pics>

<text>My family generally just goes to Sonic for drinks and desserts. Maybe we were spoiled by Midwestern locations but this location makes their slushes with a lot of ice and very little syrup. If it's like that the next time we go I doubt we'll ever go back to this particular location.< /text><username>Robert Clymer< /username></record>

I thought, after Jack in the Box discontinued their cheese sticks, I'd never be able to find it again. And then I discovered Sonic and all my cheesy needs are met! Not to mention the awesome variety of drinks they have!<//Review>

The service here is probably the worst I've ever seen. I get dragged here by friends every once in a while and every time one of their orders is messed up, they get charged incorrectly, or the employees just straight up forget about them. It's ridiculous how much it happens.<//review>

<review>I live far from sonic drive in restaurants and I went to visit this one with my mom and she ordered a hamburger and I ordered a cheesy pretzel dog with fries and a slush. Well my mom's hamburger meat was burnt and my fries were disgusting and cold. I won't eat here anymore.< /review>< Rate>

I waited 20 minutes and the drive-thru one time and when I called to complain the manager gave me attitude. I think her name was Christine or Justine.<//Review>

Worst customer service ever we waited to order for about 30 minautes while we see everyone else around us order and receive their food and we ask the order and she says there is 15 people in line to order which doesn’t make since because we see everyone order and receive their food!<//text>

<text>Tried to get food in line. 1st the person taking orders ignored me for a few minutes so I started to drive and then she finally asked what I ordered so I had to back up with another car behind me. Then she proceeded to get my order wrong so I decided to just drive to the window which was taking forever so I just jumped out of line. Very disappointing experience< /text>< Pictures>

Horrible for Sonic standards. Not a very busy evening, fully staffed and it takes 12 minutes to take the car in front of me and their order (which in turn was 3 items...) then I sit there awaiting any acknowledgement for an additional 5-7 minutes. Really?!< /Text>
