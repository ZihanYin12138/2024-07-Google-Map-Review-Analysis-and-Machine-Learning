<Review>I was picking something out and the security walked up to me asking if I was going to pay for what I had in my hand ? Duuh I'ma pay he assumed I was stealing I found that very disrespectful he said I had items in my pockets when all o had was a ointment in my hand for my son he wasn't even wearing any store clothing or security uniform. I had to ask the cashier if he was actually their store security. She was nice. Your security needs better customer service training.< /Review>< user_id>

I write this knowing full well the pharmacy staff  will not care. I have been to many pharmacies and been frustrated with slow motion staff. However this stores pharmacy is the worst.  I went through the  drive through yesterday to pick up my medication. For 15 minutes I sat at the window without being acknowledged let alone served. There were 4 cars behind me creating chaos in the parking lot because they were blocking they way. It was truly infuriating to watch 3 women milling around going through other prescriptions but serving no one inside or out for the 15 minutes I sat there. I range the call button and they just hung it up without saying anything.  It  all seemed way way to intentional and although this location is convenient for me I am never going back for medication.</review>

<review>This is for the Pharmacy: I understand that there are a lot of customers waiting for their prescriptions, which mean the wait may be longer, but it should not take 35 minutes before I am rudely asked if I have been helped. Then it takes another 20 minutes before I actually receive my medications. The workers are incompetent and they are just walking acting like they are preoccupied, instead of helping the customers.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

This review is for the pharmacy. The pharmacy service is dismal. Very, very slow. There really is no excuse for such bad service. More than once I just left the store because the line for prescriptions was so long and not moving at all. I've seen frail, elderly people who had to leave because they just couldn't stand on their feet any longer in line! My heart was breaking for them This is pathetic. The drive thru window is no better. There just seems to be no incentive at ALL for them to improve in this area. Of course, they wouldn't DARE try to pull this crap in a more affluent neighborhood. For this I hate them and will not do business with this pharmacy. The laziest bunch of no-count workers that I've  ever encountered. Do yourself a favor and take your business elsewhere.</Text>

<Text>The staff here are absolutely incompetent. When I tried to refill one of my medicines i was given the wrong dosage. When trying to explain the problem i was told to talk to my doctor for a dosage change. What if this was heart medicine? I could have been killed. Absolutely incompetent. I'm changing pharmacies. You lost my business for good, Walgreens. Be thankful I'm not the suing type.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Rude and careless. One of the cash registers was demanding and impatient with my mother who is foreign and doesn't understand English very well so the worker had a negative tone and loud voice, almost to a point where she was yelling at her.</review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) You buy and make points that is great but when you already have a lot of points and you want to change those points ahhhh there is the problem you cannot change all the points only about 5 dollars which is not much but it will be great that when you already have many points to be able use it all and not 5 by 5

Compras y haces puntos eso es genial pero cuando ya tienes muchos puntos y quieres cambiar esos puntos ahhhh ahí está el problema no puedes cambiar todos los puntos solamente lo de alrededor de 5 dólares que no es mucho pero será genial que cuando ya tuviera muchos puntos poder usarlo todos y no de 5 en 5</Review></record></dataset><record>

Friendly & helpful staff. I love the design & layout of this store, so architecturally beautiful with the exposed metal & stairs. There is always such a wide variety of all the latest fashions & trends, home decor, record players & vinyls...there really is something for everyone. It just has such a rich layering of different elements to create this great atmosphere.</Review>

Pro tip shop for winter clothes on the west coast and summer clothes on the east coast. Always stop in UO when I pass one if not buying something its always been a cool shop to browse. I vividly Remember being a young teenager begging and yearning to exclusively shop there and now I'm aware it it's not all that but from time to time I'll splurge or find something cheap. But realistically I'm not as much as a YUPPIE as I'd like to think.<//Review>< pictures>

Employee Alyssa(? spelling) had the nerve to run out of the store after me to ask where an item I had been thinking about buying was. I told her that I left it on the table near doors I had exited. I am not sure what kind of loss prevention procedures are in place at this brand but being an Assistant General Manager for a HUGE company, I know better than to EVER accuse a guest of stealing without actually seeing the actual consealment. I will be filing a complaint with the DM of this location.< /Text>

Mr. Tanna was very helpful and informative to a friend of mine in India. I really like his straightforward, tell it like it is, way of explaining things. He even answered some of my own questions from a separate matter, which I so appreciated. I highly recommend Mr. Tanna for anyone needing help with immigration issues. He’s very professional and knows his stuff. Thank you Mr. Tanna!<//Text>

Mr. Chetan Tanna is an experienced and capable immigration lawyer. He helped us immensely to solve several difficult matters with our case and because of him we got through it with no issue at all. The application process is difficult to take on by yourself, just one or two mess ups could cause serious delay or a refusal for your immigration application. That is something that should not be risked, not in today’s immigration environment. This is the reason a good lawyer is necessary.

Often when we had concerns that were troubling us, Chetan was always available even after business hours. Immigration is complex and confusing; the multiple applications including the tricky questions are not easy for anyone to understand.  It must be noted because of Chetan’s calm character and excellent advice - reassuring us that - "everything is alright” helped a lot during the stressful waiting period and the occasional USCIS letters asking for information.

Chetan went along to our interview at the USCIS office in San Diego, California, he was there in case the officer had questions we did not understand. The interview turned out fine and as Chetan predicted; our case was approved.

Looking back the whole process turned out well. I recommend “The Law Offices Of Chetan Tanna” whether you are applying for a visa, a green card or any immigration issue, Chetan with his many years of experience and successes is the lawyer you are looking for. My wife and I thought his fees were reasonable and fair. Good luck in your case.< /review>

I highly recommend Tanna Law Firm if you are looking for fast legitimate,  smooth, thorough , insightful for a genuine cost and warm helpful guidance in processing your case. My case has been very smooth and today is almost 5 years since I file my first petition and now I have my citizenship. The transition won’t have been that fast and smooth, if my case has been handled by other. I’m very glad for all the genuine, predictable advises and for the impeccability of their words… Ahima( Kathy)< /text>< pictures>

I shared some details with him and he patiently listened. He told me that he is not currently taking new clients but he willingly answered my questions. He even gave me his office hours so I could call back with my husband on the phone. I called a second time and he was just as courteous. He gave me his honest opinion about whether or not I would need a lawyer. His advice was super helpful in determining my next steps. Knowing he could not take me on as a client and still helping me was surprising. The immigration world can be scary and confusing and to find some humility in it is truly priceless. If he was taking clients I would have chosen to work with him.<//review></record></dataset><record>

I have known Mr.Chetan Tanna for 5 years and more.
I have consulted him for the most complicated of visa cases and he has always been very responsive in helping me sort those.
There are times when he has also given me free advise over the phone depending on the situation and when needed.
I would certainly recommend him for all visa services.< /text>

Attorney Chetan P Tanna is highly reliable lawyer for all your immigration needs. I have know him since last 5 years and he has handled all my immigration needs. Very honest, most reliable, will let you know if your case is possible or not & not like other lawyers just interested in increasing his clientele base and getting his fees. For all my immigration needs and advise I have always taken his help. He is very competent & has thorough  knowledge about his subject. I highly recommend Chetan P Tanna for any immigration needs.</review>

I have known Attorney Chetan P. Tanna for last 25 years or more. He is an excellent lawyer who has not only helped me and my family but also several friends and relatives I have referred to him for last 25 years!

Chetan has been the most resourceful, honest and skillful attorney I have known. He gives proper advice to all my referrals to him. If he cannot handle a case, he will promptly tell you so.

I will never hesitate to hire him as my attorney as and when needed. I SEE HIM AS A VERY DILIGENT AND DEDICATED, HONEST LAWYER.< /text>

I have know Chetan Tanna since 1980. He is the most honest, sincere and hardworking person. He is not only well versed in Immigration Law and on the top of current developments in this field but also consultation in general law. One good quality of Chetan is -he is an empathetic listener and values client's time and concerns and resolved the situation quickly. I always consult him for any legal issue I encounter before I take any action. I greatly value his advice.</review>

My Green Card process handled by Chetan and his office.

He is very knowledgeable in immigration law (both employment and family), very responsive and proactive in handling RFE from USCIS in timely manner.

He always responds phone calls immediately,  answers critical questions with correct judgement and  guided me in right direction.

I really appreciate his support and help in this process for over a decade.</Text>

Jennifer was excellent . I do not know that much about cell phones and she explained everything to me and made it easy. I wish I had employees like Jennifer in my department store. She was simply the best!!!</Text>

<Review>I lost my phone last Friday and since it had been three years since my last replacement, I was ready to purchase a new one.  When I got to the store, Jennifer Rodas helped me to select a phone that meets my needs, and then Shailesh took care of the paperwork and removed the suspension I had placed on the line.  They were quite busy and shorthanded for a Saturday and managed to take care of several customers simultaneously.  Shailesh also sold me a screen protector and case and Jennifer put those on expertly and set up the phone and verified service.  I was very happy with their service and my new purchase.<//Review>< Name>

I can't live without this place. My SIM card went nuts and the guy fixed the issue. Great customer service.

I love the products. My current phone is a Samsung & from Cricket. I have dropped it several times; no cracks, or damage at all.

I pay only $55 a month for unlimited everything. The service is excellent.  If I have issuses (rare) I simple call customer services or go to my local Cricket store.

So, I highly recommend this company, their products, and services to everyone. I highly recommend this store especially.< /review>

<Review>Friendly service, quick and accurate answers. Great discounts. Good thing that in the previous store I went they did not have what I was looking for and the butcher would sell it to me and I would have to go to the other store.

Cricket Serive is good its self but the staff in this location is very  unsatisfactory , a girl named  Maria she is a representative she smokes weeds and drinks beers when shes alone in the store, i am a customer and i work near this store location and this is how i know this Girl named Maria have been drinking under the influence of drugs and alcoholl when she left alone . one tme i went to pay my bill on my break on a sunday and she was smoking right out side with guys who sells fakes ID's on the street and she said that the system was down she ask me To come back another day
It makes me wonder what type of people does Cricket Wireless in  2487 Mission st hired. I even think she sells more then phones in there.< /review>

<review>I totally Agree with you Mohamed. This Girl named Maria over charge my mom and told her there was no more recepits. I also have noticed her strange attitude when shes drugged her eyes are red or low and stinks like weed or alcohol. Girl Maria who works on 2487 mission st cricket wireless smokes weed and drinks beer with the guys who sell fakes ID's  when she left alone in the store i know this becuase i work in front of this cricket wireless. She also has a bad aproach to customer you will hear from her that the system is down to come back again, or wont even say hi or talk to you when u walk in. She lied to my mom and over charge her 3 times for 1 CHEAP case she said that was her promotion sale, also i noticed every saturday or sunday she is very hangover. and smells terreble like alcohol , she is not in any condition to be at work. What kind of staff do this cricket wireless have here. I would NOT suggest you to go buy a cellphone from a lady named Maria who is under the influence also always ask for ur recepts. PLEASE HIRE PROFFECIONAL PEOPLE WHERE I CAN TRUST MY MONEY.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

I’ve been an Edge customer for years.  They’ve always done fantastic work on my BMW, from regular maintenance to track prep.  These guys are top notch technicians and also track and driving enthusiasts, so they are a source I go to for routine work and performance modifications.  Work is always done right and not at dealer pricing. Ryan, the owner, has been a trusted advisor and I will continue to go to him to keep my car running at top performance.< /review>

<Text>I've used Edge Motorworks for all my BMW work since I moved from Sacramento to the East Bay Area.  Great customer service, always right up front with what need to be done now, what can wait, etc.  I never have any questions about the quality of the work or the value.<//Text><user>112963110512309896297</user>< response>

Always great customer service! I have been an Edge client since 2013. I appreciate the transparency that Ryan provides. For example, when I go in for any service, he completes that service but always does an overall diagnostic of my car. He alerts me of what I need to do next which prepares me mentally and financially!😊 I own a 2006 BMW 325i and I’m at 135k miles and I know I will go further with Edge overseeing the care of my car! Thanks Ryan!< /text>

<review>I have been taking my BMW to Edge Motorworks for many years, and I have always been happy with their service. I have consulted with Ryan at various times for questions related to my BMW, and he has always given me an honest and trusted opinion. Last month I took my car to Edge for routine maintenance and to have my car thoroughly checked before my extended warranty through the BMW dealership expired. Ryan and his staff did a great job of servicing my car and finding repair issues due to their expertise and experience. I received my car back on time as promised by Ryan. I later took my car to the local dealership and had them repair the problems that Ryan and his staff had found during their inspection. I highly recommend Edge Motorworks.<//review><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x808fec72708557ff:0xaed95a0666db9891< /gmap_id></record>

I have been servicing my 3 BMWs at EDGE for over 10 years, and consider them the best BMW specialists in East Bay, specially TRI Valley area. They know , love and respect BMW cars, drive them and have attention to details and quality of work that is better then our local BMW dealership.<//text>

Ryan helped me out with walnut shell blasting on the intake valves on my MK6 GTI. Friendly, knowledgeable, and came in at a price much cheaper than other places that wanted to charge me an arm and a leg. Looking forward to getting future work done at Edge.<//Review>

The score for a recent visit to EDGE Motorworks for general maintenance is a perfect five (5) of five.  Telephone reception to make appointment is clear and a breeze.  Arriving to appointment and technician attention for work is prompt.  Mechanic work to assess and fix is a logical process.  What's excellent is, where possible, mechanic capably restored OEM equipment, used new components as appropriate and did not unnecessarily order more pricey parts to swap.  Edge's pricing is fair and the workmanship supports OEM quality.  Thanks very much!!<//review>

<Review>Oh these guys know their stuff! We usually use them for about 65% of our Audi maintenance and repairs. We have two B8.5 model S4s and they've never been stumped over our issues. Whenever we have conflict with the Audi Dealership, we go here.

The Owner is just as attentive and kind as his staff. They even offer a ride if you've got no other way to go somewhere after you drop your car off. They are very accurate with the time needed for your service and the actual needs of your car. They will level with you when its needed too.

Their prices are usually super competitive and we trust their work performed.</Review>< Pictures>

EDGE Motorworks in Dublin is excellent. I have been a customer there for well over ten years and they continue to provide the same outstanding service and customer care with the same level of knowledge, experience, professionalism, attention to detail, and enthusiasm. Gordon and his team are truly exceptional and I couldn't recommend them any higher even to the most discriminating BMW or Mini owner. Thank you guys!</Review>

I always find the automotive service to be outstanding and the customer service to be professional.  Unlike the dealership, I never feel like they are manufacturing problems for purposes of running up my bill.  Honest suggestions and recommendations on what maintenance can be deferred. Convenient drop-off and pick up, and located near the Dublin BART Station, so I can drop my car off in the morning before my commute and pick it up in the evening to drive home.</text>

<review>Happy to say that I've been a customer for over twenty years. I'm also quite pleased to say  that the Edge team are  the most RELIABLE and HONEST guys I've ever entrusted my cars to. They find ways to save me money and give me insights into my vehicles so I can plan for future repairs as well have confidence in the safety of my cars. As a psychotherapist, the biggest compliment in my profession is a personal referral. I whole heartedly refer friends and relatives to Edge, knowing that I have 100% confidence in their work and their integrity.</review>< user_id>

Gave me a much better price than my dealer (and better than a few other places I called for estimates). Also managed to get me back and forth to my residence (all the way across town) between drop-off and pick-up. They were fairly informative on the issues present, confirmed some things I already knew as well. All together, a very pleasant experience.<//Review>

I'm always satisfied after a visit. I've never felt I didn't get my $ worth. They will always inform me of required and optional service which is great compared to other places that make it seem like some very optional service needs to be done or you'll be stranded.< /text>

<Review>A few years ago I needed some work done on my BMW 530i. I dug around and a friend of mine (through a friend of his) suggested Edge. I have found these guys are as good as it gets. Very professional and thorough. The goal is to give you their best work and make sure you leave happy. Recently purchased an older model Audi Allroad. It needed tons of work. I got a bunch of quotes from reputable shops. Again, I decided to have Edge do the work. I was not disappointed. I highly recommend.<//Review>< Time>

The service advisors (John, Gillian, Derek) are all super knowledgeable, very professional, and will take time to explain repairs.  The owner, Gordon, is even more knowledgeable and a very nice gentleman.   They're pretty passionate about cars.  They have serviced my 95 Miata plus E46 and E39 BMW's.< /review>

I went to Edge based on the recommendations of two friends.  They were as advertised, i.e., courteous, honest, and of equal importance: exceedingly competent.  Add to this very fair pricing and you have a winner.  If you live in the East Bay and take your German car someplace else you are doing yourself a disservice.< /text>

< Review>
If any part of their technology fails, they don't have the capability to execute any sort of contingency plan.

Customer has a as valid coupon.
Sorry, our scanning machine is down.
Okay, can you still honor the coupon?
No, I can't scan it.
Right, but we can read what the coupon says, and I have a calculator built into my phone...I also have cash money.
Our system is down, we can't use coupons.

I'm not sure if this is a bad on corporate subway, or just the local level management. There really needs to be a foolproof way to allow a coupon to be used when a part of the coupon reading technology fails.

Also they leave a little stem part in the jalapenos, but that's not really a big deal.< /Review>

I ordered the advertised Melts sandwiches which has the grill marks on the buns. That did not happen, it was just toss it in the oven until the bread is crunchy like a cracker.  I asked the employee "where are the grilled melt marks like in the picture? She said we don't have the tray for that..then I said I would not have ordered the sandwiches had I known. Her attitude did not help. So both sandwiches have over toasted bread.  Trust...I will not use this particular 1790 West Bush Street Subway again, $20 for a false advertised meal👎👎👎<//Text>

I arrive at this superb place every couple of days  as I enjoy the  special atmosphere that is characterizes this restaurant. The personel is highly welcoming and qualified. The service is certainly fast. Not to mention, the food they cook is excellent. I frequent more than once and I was always happy. The expense is modest. I suggest this place to my friends and family.<//Text>

I have been shopping at this market for over five years. On 3/19/2020, I was double charged for my groceries. The system approved my purchase but froze before a receipt was provided. The cashier stated that the system timed out. So, she had me enter my card again. Immediately the charge is approved. Now, I have two charges for $65.82 and a minute apart if that. The manager on duty that was called to handle my refund request was beyond rude. He yelled at me that he would not refund my money. I have a receipt and proof from the bank that I  charged twice. Sadly, I left after being rudely treated and accused of lying about being overcharged!<//text>

I don't see anyone cleaning the shopping carts. Store could be cleaner. Bakery/tortilleria is great. Produce is old sometimes. Staff is friendly.<//review>

< Review>
I don't appreciate the sign in Spanish about leave your backpack at home. Obviously the owner can't appreciate people who go to work with a backpack to carry a change of clothes or tools or whatever else they use throughout the day.
In San Diego it can be cold in the morning and then later hot in the afternoon, hence the change of clothes to be prepared for both. I'm a substitute teacher and I also use my backpack to carry certain sensitive equipment which I use in classrooms and I can't leave it in the classroom overnight as I'll be in a different one the next day as well as the fact that I never know who'll be in the room later that night for one reason or another and the District won't reimburse me.
I don't appreciate anyone making me feel like I'm some kind of possible low life because I have a backpack.<//Review>

My favorite corn tortillas are made here! The meat selection gets the job done. The produce is below average, don't buy unless using within 24 hrs, spoils fast. The pan dulce here is ok. They have a juice bar I haven't tried yet.</review>

Dr. Drais is an excellent dentist!  He is up with the times and offers the latest dental equipment.  Best of all~~he is a gentle dentist!
It is so nice to be greeted by my first name when I enter his office. Dr. Drais’ entire staff earns an
A+ for their skill levels and compassion.
New to the area or just need to change dentists?

Thank you for a great service to Dr. Drais for not pushing for any unnecessary procedures, Hygienist Sara for her meticulous work, Pattie and the entire staff for making us feel welcome. It was a pleasure to deal with everyone in the office. Keep up the great work!!</Review>

I suffer from anxiety and it hits me hard when I see any dentist.  I’ve been seeing Dr Drais for some time now and he always makes sure I am doing well and comfortable.  I appreciate the extra care every time I go in.  The staff is amazing and they are always the sweetest.<//text>

By far the best dentist office in town.   The whole staff from the delightful office Manager to the hygienist and doctor are professional, courtesy and humorous.  They make you feel like part of a family while take excellent care of your teeth.< /review>

<Review>This is a great practice. I got in as soon as I moved here, but my husband had already started working and I had to bring my infant to my cleaning. A tech who was on her break played with my baby in the room with me while I got my dental work done.

Everyone I have ever met here has been wicked accommodating and nice.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Dr. Drais was very kind and caring during my visit as he treated my first cavity. I didn’t feel any pain, pinching, or really anything! His assistant was also incredibly kind to me, and knowledgeable. They both checked on me throughout my visit and updated me on anything I should know about as they went along. I highly recommend this office because patient care is clearly very important to them! Front desk is also sweet and helpful!< /Text>< rate>

Was great to finally have a cleaning .  Stephanie, the hygienist was very thorough.  Great to see Dr. Drais who let me know I was doing a good job cleaning .  Always a pleasant office experience with kind and considerate staff like Patty and Stephanie and of course Dr. Drais.  They took the utmost precautions regarding Covid procedures.  I felt very safe and secure there.<//text>

Kind, professional, gentle.

I've got nothing but good things to say about Dr. Drais, the staff and the office. I came here with a pretty extreme phobia of dentistry that I've recently conquered thanks to the experience I've had here.

I highly recommend!< /Text>

This is a posting from my wife since she doesn’t have google but wanted to leave wonderful feedback for a wonderful dentist. Dr.Drais is just great. He is a calm, kind and compassionate dentist.  And...He give you an honest answer with gentle treatment.  I am always comfortable while getting work done. His staff all extent excellent care too. Patti is always knowing, caring and accommodating (which also adds to your comfort and confidence with Dr. Drais’ office).  I give Two thumbs up for this office and thank them for their stellar care!  ~ Patient Amber H. Vos</Text>

The office is strictly following the Covid-19 protocols. I felt safe and relaxed.
I had to have a new crown put it, and it  was beautiful! Thank you Dr. D and wonderful staff!

I’m not sure if you can ask for more in a dentist, but I know that I can’t.  Dr. Drais, along with his staff, are totally “patient-focused” and truly go the extra mile to make certain that everyone who comes in is treated with the best care.  I had tried a number of other dentists in the Monterey area prior to finding Dr. Drais, and, in my opinion and experience, his practice is MILES above the rest of the practices.  I cannot imagine going to someone else.<//text>

<review>Went to see Dr. Joshua Drais today for the first time to address some dental concerns I have. I love the  atmosphere in the office, the doctor & staff are super nice & friendly. I love how they try to  make the patient feel as comfortable as possible & the warm neck pillows. Will definitely be going back for treatment.</review>< gmapID>

This was our first visit with Dr. Drais   They were able to fit us in the next day which was important for our daughters orthodontist appointment,  she needed a cavity filled. They were super friendly and efficient we were only there for about an hour,  I really appreciated Dr. Drais not been in a hurry and explaining all the steps to my daughter. Afterword my daughter who hates going to the dentist says it was the best experience she ever had .</Text>

First of all let me make something clear I am TERRIFIED of going to the dentist...that said it was a really great experience. Everyone  in the office was compassionate and caring. I had a couple of teeth worked on and it was painless and my bite is perfect. I would highly recommend Dr. Drais and his staff.< /Review>

I had a dental emergency on a Sunday afternoon and called Dr. Drais’s office leaving a message about this. He called me back within an hour and we discussed my situation and next steps.

Having recently moved full time to the Monterey area I had not established a dentist in this area. Dr. Drais’ quick response and the staff’s ability to fit me in were impressive. The repair (required replacing a cracked crown) was done in one session and came out great! This overall has been a great experience.<//Review>

Dr. Drais and his staff are fantastic. I'm not a huge fan of having my teeth worked on, who is really, but they go out of their way to make sure you are comfortable. The dental hygienists make sure to accommodate any teeth sensitivity I had during my cleaning and cavity fillings. They remember that I go by a shortened version of my name and that is such a welcoming touch. They even gave me movies to watch during my filling. The office is modern and clean. I will definitely be recommending them and coming back for my regular check ups.<//Text>

<Review>Very professional and caring dental practice. My husband and I have been going to this practice for over 7 years and although Dr. Drais is fairly new, he is very thorough, professional, has a nice friendly way, not to mention an incredible staff! They are always on time and explain all procedures and costs clearly. I would highly recommend this dental practice.< /Review>< Pics>

Wow, they knocked it out of the park with me! Got disoriented and had to call for directions, they were sweet & patient with me. Everyone was just so welcoming, well trained,thorough,and professional. I've not experienced this kind of treatment in many yrs. I received great instructions  to care for myself and felt confident that these were the people who were going to help me recover my dental health. Bravo Dr.Drais and team!< /text>

I am so happy we found this dentist! Being new to the Monterey peninsula, we’ve had some issues finding doctors, but we are very pleased with our dentist. I have had new fillings, a crown from a cracked tooth and a couple of cleanings already, and have had no problems or discomfort. I confidently recommend Dr. Drais.</Text>

I love these people. They are all so friendly and kind, and so professional, too. I've had some great dentists over the years, and Dr. Drais practice is in the top 10%.<//review>

< Review>
My crown fell off last night and I had no intention of getting it fixed. My daughter was not going to allow that. She got on the phone the next morning and called a few dentist offices to get a quote and after being given unsatisfying answers she hung up without making an appointment. She finally called Dr. Joshua Drais office and was shocked when Patty asked her something no one else had. She simply asked if I still had the crown and if so, to bring it in as it could possibly be salvaged and put back in. This along with Patty calling back informing us they were able to fit me in that same day instead of the next day, gave a great first impression of this office. When we walked in we were greeted by our names although we had never been there before and hadn’t mentioned our name. After sitting down waiting for the assistant to bring us in, only a minute had passed and we were called to go in. From the moment I sat in the chair until I left the office I was taken very well care of and so was my daughter. We were constantly asked if we wanted water or to watch Netflix/Hulu/music in between work being done. Seriously, just visit them once, for a consultation or cleaning and you’ll see why you could never use another dental office ever again!< /Review>

No pain and I had fun talking to the dental assistant who was really into history. They also allowed me to watch a bio of Walt Disney. Dentist appointments are different now. Lol<//Review>

<Text>Dr Drais and staff were very professional and courteous in providing service...Right from the first call in booking appointment, front desk assistance to dental assistants’ guidance, it was excellent...I was particularly impressed with Dr Drais’ sincerity in providing a referral to another surgeon and willingness to have conversations about the dental procedures...I’ll definitely give the team thumbs up...😉

On a follow-up visit, Pam, the hygienist did a great job...The front desk staff were also very courteous and professional...<//Text>< Resp>

Dr Drais takes time to explain what is procedure and listens. Staff cares and makes a not so pleasant experience very pleasant. Plus with Netflix to watch while getting filling brings whole new meaning to Netflix and Drill.
Get your work done here for sure if not already.<//text>

Dr. Drais, Patty, Pam, as well as the rest of the team are wonderful - friendly, kind and considerate folks that do all they can to anticipate your needs before you realize what they are, and of whom work hard to get what you need as fast as possible< /Review>

Let me start by saying this is the most professional dentist I have ever visited across the 5 different countries where I have worked, studied and lived.  I went to his office and was carefully examined. They took a new type of scan which provided a panoramic detailed view of my face. Dr. Drais even pointed out that my left side nasal passage is not as open as my right side. In my second visit ,which was a routine cleaning visit, Dr. Drais himself took care of me and examined every tooth and pointed out all potential problems to monitor. He took his time to explain everything in detail and draw diagrams to help me understand. Also, all his staff greet you by name when you enter the office.
I'd say that he is a gem of a dentist and you would be very lucky to have him.<//Text>

<text>Came back to this location recently after a period of disappointment but decided to give it another try and it was so much better!! The new owner is very friendly and is doing great things to improve this location!! Lower prices, better quality food, and better service! This location is definitely improving and we'll be back!!< /text></record>

<Review>My wife and I used to come here regularly months ago and than we had three bad experiences in a row. One of the employees or owners said it was new ownership months back.  We just gave up. Brisket was dry if they even had any and they cut all the fat off. That's the moisture and flavor. Mac and cheese was watery. Sauces were watery. Sausage was cold. This was always a nice treat on the way home from a long day at work and now it's just a thought. Only thing enjoyable was the baked beans and Cole slaw</Review><gmapID>0x80c32d982f31d8cf:0x39579b3a02a320a4</gmapID>< pics>

So let down. Walked in and they greeted.But it was like it was a hassle to do it. No eye contact,No smile or customer service. All they said was were out of brisket. I was looking so forward to it. It was me and my brother. I got the 2 meat plate. I got pulled pork,chicken,Potato casserole and Mac and Cheese. My Brother got the ribs,Cole slaw and baked beans. The pulled park was cold and very watery,The chicken was OK,The potato casserole had no chives,no bacon and a few shreds of cheese,The mac n cheese was watery and had a strange taste. My brothers Cole slaw was very tangy,The baked beans were OK,The ribs were cold and had a strange taste to them. He only ate 1 and maybe a few bites from another. The roll was so tiny. Also no ice cream. The soft serve machine was sitting in the back hallway with the electric cord wound up on the side of it. It was such a let down 😟</text>

< Review>
Finally, this place was put out of its misery. It started off so well. Good food, good service then somewhere down the line it went south. Food was meh, service was just okay, ice cream machine never worked, some food items were sold out very early, even had a kid walking in and out of the preparation area. I believe a sushi restaurant is coming up in its place so we'll see how that goes.< /Review>

Who doesn't love an all meat place that tastes great with a clean setting. You can even get free ice-cream while you are there eating or even if you're waiting for your order to go you can not beat that. The prices are excellent for the quality of meat you get as well. I recommend it to any meat eater and even vegetarians.<//text>

My brother raves about this location, so we all decided to celebrate a belated Mother's Day together. The only soda that was available was Root Beer. The soft serve was broken. They have been buying ice cream and serving it, but they ran out of it. Both lemonade/orange drink machines were down to the minimum. The iced tea was several days old. The green beans were inedible: overcooked and tasted like pure pepper. My family stated the fries were over salted. The dinner rolls tasted differently than they usually do. They did not have any Texas toast. They were out of pulled pork. My brisket was completely different than my brothers: all fatty and mushy. The potato casserole lacked bacon and tasted like pure onions and garlic. My baked beans were good, but my husbands tasted like pure vinegar. There was a small child around 3 years old going in and out of the kitchen. The staff was friendly and apologetic about everything. They even ran out to purchase some drinks that my mom could have. My brother stated this was not how things usually are when he brings his wife and kids to eat there.< /review><gmap_id>0x80c32d982f31d8cf:0x39579b3a02a320a4<//gmap_id>< Resp>

I am very disappointed in my experience at this location today. The food was NOT like the food at any other locations.  The Jalapeno Cheddar Kielbasa was completely different than what I had last week and was more of a hot dog in size. None of the meat was warm, in fact the Kielbasa looked as though it was taken out of the packaging and sliced and served. And the chicken was tough. The one and only employee there was a bit overwhelmed with trying to complete the previous customer order and take my order.<//text>

<text>Nothing special, but reasonable 'chain' barbecue.  Totally empty at 7:30pm on a Sunday.  How do they survive?  The brisket was better than the chicken, and the ribs are okay, but not much meat on the three rib portion.  Slaw was good, and the spicey beans (can't remember their name for them) were unusual but delicious.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Two rolls of  rough brown bathroom type paper towels were out but no napkins.  We had to tear off a strip of paper, it's not even perforated to make it tear off in an even napkin shaped piece.  Softer paper napkins would work better I would think.</Review>< pics>

Customer service was  average. The servers seems pretty overwhelmed, however they were not busy at all. Food was ok, upside is they are located in a vast shopping center.</Review>

<Text>We've been to many different Dickey restaurants, but this one takes the cake for not having much. They were out of many sides, yellow cups, sweet tea, ice cream machine out of order. The POS was down and only axcepting cash. The food we did recieve was cold. They did make a batch of sweet tea, but wasn't sweet whatsoever. Wow talk about a bad day to come here.   Totally disappointed. Will change my review in the future when I revisit in a few months Hopefully it will be better and they will get their act together.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Asked to speak with manager and both employees go to the back for like 10 minutes and come back with he is not available.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Every time my wife and I have been here, They never have  all the meat available. First thing out of their mouth is what they don’t have. They always have an excuse.

I usually like this place, but this is the rating for this visit. First of all they were out of a few meats, beef ribs and pull pork and chicken, but that's ok. they were out of Sprite and Dr. pepper.  The spicey bbq sauce they were almost out. The waffle fries were super salty and the kid side drink was $2.50, it should be cheaper considering the meals are a little expensive.</text>

Food was horrible! The lady that was serving our plate was cross contaminating pork with chicken and beef.  She kept the same gloves on when she was touching all of the above items. Then, they didn't have enough sides readily available we would have to wait 10 to 12 minutes for about three of the side orders that we wanted.</Review>

In comparison to several parks that we have visited over the past few months this by far is filled with the nicest people we have had the pleasure of meeting. Starting from when we first got here Roy offered to help set up the camper thanks Roy. The owners are very nice and giving to the residents in the community without that sense of ulterior motive... The campground itself is great .... The pool is awesome,clean, and No discrimination against our Doberman...(they have room to run and are still a little confused about the weird looking Doberman here ....Goat farm)Even after a few plants have been destroyed.... sorry guys:/ I think our cat thinks he is Simba has everything that the light touches belongs to him :-) We didn’t plan on being here as long as we have been and will miss it when we leave but we will be staying here whenever we have the chance in the future....  thanks again for all the hospitality and having such a wonderful group of people at your park<//Text>

I have no complaints here, the pets and flowers are nice to see and the pool is by appointment which is nice because you feel very private when enjoying your sun time. The spots have enough room for my needs, and it is typically pretty quiet/calm.< /Review>

<Text>I don't recommend this place roads are dangerous. There's only one way and we almost crash with a truck that was coming out of the park. The pictures are deceiving, this place looks completely different in person. Very disappointed after seeing all nice pictures and comments. People living there are intimidating. This place is very far from everything and there's no signal at all.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

You will think you made a wrong turn into a horror movie lol (maybe because we arrived late at night) but don't be fooled this RV Park is a piece of heaven on earth. The owners Douglas and Monette are amazing people with kind hearts. All the neighbors were super helpful and kind. The pool area is relaxing. Loved the goats and feeding them :) Park is exceptionally clean and well maintained. My favorite part was the Prayer Garden... for the 45 minutes I spent there I was transformed. Monette gave me a personal tour. Enjoy the pictures.< /text>

this RV park, needs a lot of work, management often turns off the water, and electricity to work on the property. There is a lot of people with dogs, and almost never clean up after the pets, we didn’t have any dogs and still we will wake up to poop in or spot. My biggest issue was Amazon delivering my packages to the general store, every single package that was delivered there we would received it open. We reported our concern to Amazon and they stated sometimes packages accidentally opened but that is impossible for us to receive every single one open, so they asked us to report every single one and stated we were not the first ones to report this address. There is fees to consider if you want to move in here, you have to pay your base rent $650 + 25 dlls monthly fee for electric meter, so basically rent is 675 + whatever electricity you use. We would end up paying about 730 monthly which is kinda expensive for an RV park like this one. Management doesn’t provide maintenance to the property you have to clean and buy your own products to get rid of the weeds, any issue you have to text management they answer whenever they want. Park is in a dirt road which is not very accessible, if cars come out speeding you have to be careful since is only one road in and out. We were told no furniture in the trash there is a fee for that as well, but yet the trash bin was always surrounded by   Furniture. There is so much going at night here not as peaceful as we thought, park is not gated so anyone can go in and out at night, we had or surveillance cameras just to be safe and there was random people walking there at night that did not lived in the park. When you move in to the park you have to pay 200 dlls deposit cash. And pay three weeks cash $240 weekly. When we moved out we paid a whole month of rent since you are required to give them 30 days notice, and this is kinda weird any park that we have search none of them have this policy. From our 200 Dlls deposit we were discounted the 25 dlls meter fee, and almost 49 dlls for electricity since is to much considering we only stay here 9 days from the beginning of April and normally would be the electricity we would use for a whole month, and of course minus 10 dlls because we had to pay our own post office fee for them to send our deposit check. At night they were random drones near the windows which we were careful about sleeping with our shades open. Another issue there were people with kids here living monthly in the upper mountain of the park and in the afternoon they would shoot down with airguns all the trailer underneath the hill, people are lucky they haven’t brake a window of someones trailer. This is my honest review.<//Text>

<rate>3< /rate><text>A pretty bare bones park. It does have a peaceful, quiet setting. There are a few nice shade trees. There is a swimming pool (not available when I was there). 30 amps. No cable. Wifi spotty. Very rutted, dirt roads. Camping is on dirt. Sites not level, but workable. Price might be good for the area, but I was able to pay less for a better park about 15 miles up the road in Glen Ivy.<//text>< gmap_id>

This is a very nice hidden place, very peaceful, kids love the farm area with animals, nice views with rocks, clean pool, but most important the service and people around are just so nice that they make you feel welcomed, i felt very special in this place. a place not focussed  as business,  but as service to the community . I personally  felt this as a great place to pray and meditate after sunset. we visited this place in a class A 36 ft RV full hook ups. will for sure go back again.</text>

This is a affordable and beautiful dessert oasis nestled in the dessert, but it is not ideal if you want to seek community or be there long term. It’s a drama ditch! I have stayed here several times and it was my favorite campground ⛺️ until I experienced a traumatic experience twice with the owners /campground hosts and observed how they chose not to resolve things.

Despite the campground drama that was evident since day one, I overlooked this because I was just a guest whereas the others were permanent residents. Where the real drama began was when I decided to leave my RV for storage. The check in process was notorious and I had a flight to catch otherwise I would’ve parked elsewhere. A volunteer had a terrible attitude and I had no choice but to deal with her because she was the one left in control. She demanded cash and a different storage amount that I was quoted and had documentation of. She also refused to see that documentation. Since I was only a $10 difference I paid and later reported my experience to the owners and let it go. Why? The campground owners were out of town and left someone else in control. Also taking into consideration that the owners of the campground seemed to be very thoughtful and generous unlike the person they left in charge. I figured they made a mistake.

When picking up my RV, I asked the owners to please not allow that woman to check me out again. Fail. Here we go again...Things got so bad that after the volunteer lied about charges billed to me, I started gathering documentation. I remained calm,and the volunteer got in my face and told me that if I didn’t pay her cash and the incorrect amount that she was calling the police. I called the owners and no one answered. I waited sitting in the ground in the hot sun for 45 min with my 10yr old son because the volunteer would not correct the bill. After spotting the owner walking across the campground, I ran to get his help. He seemed unbothered and told me that he doesn’t handle billing and that I would have to continue working with the volunteer. I explained her behavior and mistake and still the owner refused to assist. I was ignored and the owners even drove by while the host was going off on me. That was the final straw. I had to call the police because I was afraid and this woman wouldn’t give me back my RV until I paid her the incorrect storage fees in cash. She adjusted the bill SOME and I just gave up disputing, paid and tried to leave. I was so thirsty after this and when we finally got our rv, the volunteer resident (Theresa) saw me getting water from a hose and she ran over and shut it off. That is how evil this woman is. Not only did I overpay and remained calm through all her BS, but then I can’t drink water!? Why the hell would they leave her in charge?

I then reflected up my experience camping there many times prior to leaving my RV in storage and I realized that their business procedures and behaviors are favored towards vulnerable people that they prey on to volunteer and run their business and keep certain information on the down low. I too was stuck there for 3 days while waiting for my mail and I volunteered my balance off by pulling weeds for 8-10 hours. As I made friends, I found that select volunteers keep certain information on the down low because they are in unique positions and have no other place to live. (I.e Rv broke down on the lot, no employment, mental issues..etc)  Guests were penalized if they reported unfair and unprofessional conduct. Families that were “favored” have been aborted because they report unsafe living circumstances. Overall this campground is in disguise of what looks like a fun, family friendly place but the people that are the face of this campground are far from that. I pray that they reevaluate their business and do the right things for business and others emotional wellbeing.</Text>

Just wanted to review a couple key points that might help in the future.\nWe extended you grace and helped fiancially with your family situation, however desiring to work here as a camp host would have been better recieved if you had avoided conflict with the park manager. We understood you wanted the campground host position and am sorry it didn't work out for obvious reasons.  However, I wish you and your family all the best and in the future and pray you find a great forever home!  Thank You!"}< /Resp>

We were impressed, the park is under new ownership and it has a great amount of upgrades and a lot of renovation.  The general store is nice with movie rentals and cool stuff, there is FREE WiFi and fire pit areas.  The tent rates are now $20.00 per tent up to 2 adults and 2 children.  The park also has a play area, pool, volleyball, basketball and Frisbee golf course was being laid out.  NO FREEWAY or ROAD NOISE nice and quiet!   Loved it will be back again and again thank you Palm View<//text>

<review>The park was quite, had a very good spot,  there in renovations trying to get the area cleaned for new guests.
I would return,  I give them 4 stars, the manager was helpful, clean bathrooms, the atmosphere was cool in weather and the neighbors were kind.
Thanks, Kjordancorp, /family motor home.</review>< pics>

Initial call answered promptly.  Staff was very helpful in answering questions.  Rates are 25.00 per night for a tent camping spot.  Will likely choose another location, but at least they are "real" people, verses a robot membership service... right?<//review>

<text>Very nice place to visit & live. Off the beaten path from the noise of the city, but close enough to make a run into town. Nice sized shaded spaces for rv's with seperate shaded area for tents.( with water & elect hook ups available) Clean showers and laundry area available. Stargazing is amaizing with ckear night skies away from city lights. Park is a work in progress with owners dedicated to various projects to improve the park. They are constantly finding ways to make your stay here enjoyable no matter if is for a weekend or long term. Nice pool to cool off in on these hot summer days, big fenced in playground for the kids.
Pet friendly! (Leash on pet required)   Breakfast served before church every sunday & food distribution once a month.
No better place to visit or live in the area!< /text>< Name>

Canoga Park Heating and A/C is a great company.  I've used them for years in 3 locations.  My unit needed some repair this time and Jose G explained everything which made decision making easy.  He showed us the old part and unit is working well.  I appreciate a company that I can count on in years to come.< /review>

We needed the rooftop  HVAC unit  and duct system inspected and problems diagnosed. Everyone who assisted us was professional, helpful and pleasant.

Response was very timely and tech, Jose Rivera, called to let us know that he was on his way. He arrived during time frame given by the great scheduler, Ben.

Tech, Jose, was masked and followed strict Covid 19 protocol.

He did a very thorough inspection, was kind enough to take pictures and send them to my email , and explained everything well.

The price for the inspection was very fair.

My partner and I were very pleased with the service from Canoga Park Heating and Air and rate them 5 stars.< /text>

My Nest heating system has been having issues for a few months. Jose came out today to take a look and I was so pleased with the service. He was on time, very courteous and did an amazing job. I will definitely be reaching out to Jose again for all of my future HVAC needs. I highly recommend! Thank you so much Jose!<//review>

I had Canoga Park Heat & Air at my house last Friday. My heater was making a strange noise I’d never heard before. The technician’s name was Johnny and he was a pleasure to deal with. He said it wouldn’t hurt to let the issue go for the summer and revisit it come fall. He could have said anything really. I will definitely be using them again.<//text>

We are very happy with the service provided by Johnny from Canoga Park Heating & Air Conditioning. Our AC was acting weird so we scheduled a service call. Johnny inspected the device and informed us that our thermostat was not working properly. Johnny installed the Nest thermostat and it is working beautifully. Johnny is very professional and extremely knowledgeable. Thank you!!</review>

Amazing how fast they came out during the hottest week this year. I called Friday night and they were there on Saturday!
They've been my go to for twenty+years

Turns out my combo heat and AC unit was 29 years old.  They maintained it so well. As it was time to replace it,  Dave came out,  chose the best one,  great price,  for my house.  They were perfect,  everything clean and did an amazing job.  The unit is incredible!< /Text>

He was on-time, professional and the price was fair. We highly recommend Dave and this company.

After getting quotes from 3 different HVAC companies, we decided to contract with Dave at CPHAC for new Carrier furnace and AC equipment. We are very happy with the work done.

<Text>I am surprised by all the wonderful reviews. We had them come out to check out our unit that was not working. When they completed inspection they said we would need repairs and refrigerant that would cost us $2500+. We we're close to pulling the trigger but decided to get a 2nd opinion. We had another company come out to check the same unit and they questioned if someone had been on the roof already because the power switch was turned off, the caps were missing and apparently they disconnected some wiring to a different unit. These guys tried to come and sabotage us for more money. We did need more of the refrigerant but we did not need any repairs or replacement parts. They probably thought we wouldn't have found out but I am so glad I got a 2nd opinion because these guys tried to screw us!< /Text><user>111377870906323564255</user><gmapID>0x80c29c130a13496d:0x47ed47c9f3625480</gmapID>< Resp>

As it was it explained to you, two units were checked and the estimate given was to repair both units in your commercial space.

It is very easy for another company to put a bad name on any previous contractor trying to impress customers to get the job. The technician did leave the switch off as the unit was not working properly to prevent further damage to your system.

Johnny really helped us out. We were dealing with from our home warranty company putting off completing this job for 6 weeks!  Johnny came out, diagnosed the problem quickly, and was very helpful in giving us the information we needed to submit for reimbursement from the home warranty company. When he returned to actually fix our furnace, he did the job in less than an hour, had all the parts, and was very professional and courteous. 6 weeks of waiting was resolved in less than 2 hours thanks to this company!< /text>

On this visit, the technician installed a new part (ordered from the manufacturer) which he had diagnosed on a previous maintenance call.  Installation was done without problem; my thermostat "checked" visually as well as internally (on wall); optimal temperature range recommended; next "step up" reviewed and quote given to me.  Cool air was welcomed;  job completed to my satisfaction.</text>

It was the hottest day of the year so far and my A/C stopped working.   I called their office and spoke with Grace.  I was expecting to be told that they wouldn't be able to come out for a week or two but Grace was able to get somebody out the very same day!!  Their tech Johnny was great as well and very professional.  Changed out the capacitor and got my A/C working again.  If wish I could give them 6 stars for how they took care of me and my family.< /text>

I had an air conditioning problem, and Johnny was able to explain that there were many issues contributing to the problem. He was extremely knowledgeable and able to explains the issues in a way that was very understandable. He made recommendations that I supported and we agreed he would be my "go to guy" for all future work. I have used Canoga Park Heating over the years and they have always been great!</Text>

Extraordinarily responsive when my elderly mother lost her a/c during a possibly life threatening heat wave in S. CA.  Came the same day to attempt to repair a 15 year-old unit, and were able to schedule a quote and next-day scheduled replacement on an emergency basis.  And...it was a very fair fixed price for everything.  They even provided a portable a/c loaner for her and set it up.  Kudos to Grace and Craig!<//Text>

Canoga Park AC installed my air scrubber during the Porter Ranch methane leak.
Greg replaced the UV light for the scrubber and did my fall heating system check up.  He was on time, wore a mask, and efficiently completed my service.
Please thank your excellent employee for me again.

They come out twice a year change filters and inspect the whole system. We had a hot couple day da here and the A/C stopped cooling. Our technician came to our aid and got us cooled down. He also explained what to do in case the same thing happened. In short, I have nothing but high praise for the professional service we get.<//Review>< pictures>

< Review>
I purchased my HVAC system from Canoga Park heating and A/C a while ago and they have kept it running perfectly for many years. Of course, after over ten years of no problems, my A/C decided to have a system malfunction, at night, while the weather reports were predicting 100 plus temperatures in two days. I called Canoga Park Heating and A/C in the morning and to my surprise, not only could they come that day, but they would be there by 1pm. We followed their app, knew who was coming and could tell  how far away Kevin was and when he arrived at the house... so we could mask up!  Kevin quickly found the problem, told me the approx. cost, but said it required  parts that might not be in stock. He asked for a minute to check and came back to tell me, not only were the parts in the warehouse, but they were less expensive than he thought. YAY! Then he told me he could pick up the parts first thing in the morning, but had to check the schedule and I should call, if I hadn't heard back by 3pm. I am so sorry I don't remember the name of the woman I spoke to, because she was wonderful. She put me on hold while  she checked with Kevin, and came back to tell me he would be here between 8-8:30am. I was  beyond grateful. Kevin, our super hero,  arrived the next morning, fixed the system in record time and just as the temperature started to rise outside.....The temperature  inside was coming down. I would say that this was the most stress free emergency service I've ever experienced. I have appreciated this company and their regular service for many years, but now I have a whole new appreciation for the service they provide and the wonderful people who make it happen.</Review>

Jose, was an excellent technician... He solved my problem in a matter of minutes, and now I can rest assured knowing my AC will last through these hot summer days to come and will filter out the polluted air from these fires.
5+++ Stars!

To begin Craig is not On the list to give a review for. Told him how to get on the roof and after just 10 minutes he came back and said he was ready to show me the quote. I know that he never went on the roof and lied. After I said that other companies said that a 2 ton would be more than enough he said he would not take the job if that’s what I wanted. What company turns down work like that. I asked him about the intake and out take being to small for a 2.5 or 3 ton he said that it does not matter. He seemed to not want this job and did not care at all about anything I would say. I will not call them back.< /Text>

We asked some not-on-the-order questions about our system (duct/flow issues) and he didn't hesitate to climb in the attic to take a look. Unlike other places we've talked to in the past, there was no pressure to do things that did not need to be done.

Professional, can-do attitude and got results. Highly recommended.</Text><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1591198767435, 'text': 'Thank you for your 5 star review, Dave!

Overall we are very happy with the service we received from Canoga Park. They installed an entire new HVAC system to replace our non-functioning evaporative cooler and old furnace.
When Dave came out to give us the estimate he was extremely knowledgable and understood what we were looking for. He was able to get us a great system without taking us over our budget.
Throughout the install the team was very respectful and covid conscious. They cleaned up after themselves before leaving each day.
Even after the install was finished, when we had concerns about some leftover ductwork, Dave came right out to take a look and fixed it on the spot.
Would definitely recommend Canoga Park Air Conditioning!<//text>

<Text>For once, I felt the technician was focusing on finding the problem instead of confusing the customer with different issues to complicate matters.  Kevin found the problem, unplugged the main A/C drain pipe from the bathroom plumbing and redirected it into a bucket under the basin.  Unfortunately, he couldn't quite explain the wet in the wall.
Although I still need to call a plumber to complete the task and find the cause root of the damp in the wall, I am satisfied with his work.
One improvement, the company did tell me about the $85 call out charge which only goes towards parts and I since didn't have any parts needed changing, I lost there.. The company did not tell me about $120 hourly rate either. Overall, you can put your trust in the company.</Text>< pictures>

He took his time working through his lunch to make sure both my heating units were serviced according to my needs. He Cleaned the filters, he made sure  there’s no gas leakage, and added Freon to the unit. He also installed a Nest thermostat for each unit so I can control the temperature from my IPhone.  Thanks to him I don’t need to replace my units. From now on I will use Canoga Park Heating & Air.  👍

<text>May 5th, 2021 Jose Rivera is GREAT!
Such a nice guy! He was on time and so courteous and Covid safe. He came in, accessed the filter and lines and main unit. He gave us a complete run-down on everything and replaced the filter and cleaned up and set us up for a payment schedule and was done in about 30 minutes. Such a pleasure to have him here today.

9/25/20 Kevin Castro came today to search for the smell we keep smelling coming from the AC. He did a thorough inspection and did not locate any problem. He was on time, with a mask and so nice. He told us about another service that can be done to eliminate contaminates in the air and we will be looking into it and may have them come back to set this up for us. We were really happy with our service, again, today.

Allan just came for another filter replacement and unit check. Everything went well. He was in and out in no time and wore a mask the whole time. Always a good experience. Thank you!

Last time: Allan was just here to replace our AC filter and do a check up on our unit. He was on time and thorough in checking everything out. Gave us some great info as well. Great experience! Thank you.</text></record></dataset><record>

Bob Wiseman and his team including Kevin, Jorge & Salvatore were all very easy to work with and the job was completed quickly.  Knowing that the split unit has a 10-year warranty & I can rely on Canoga Park Heating and Air Conditioning to fix any potential issues down the road gives me peace of mind.<//Review>

I have had them over the years service my heating and A/C.  Dave came out to give me a bid to put in dual heating and A/C.  He was so informative, professional and knowledgeable.  I love the job they did.  They were clean, fast and so accommodating.  One year later now I had an issue and they came out...no questions asked and fixed the issue at no cost to me.  No arguing but just a friendly attitude and Bob said “We need to get a team out immediately”  which they did.  And the issue had nothing to do the the dual heating or A/C.  Johnny came out and .  I highly recommend them!<//review>

I'd been struggling with my Nest thermostat for a couple weeks--restarting, reprogramming--before I called Canoga Park Heating and Air.  Why didn't I call them sooner????  They sent Kevin who arrived promptly at 8, donned his booties, and went to work. It turned out to be a heater problem, which he fixed and explained to me.  He also changed the filter on my heater and gave me more info about my Nest. Above and beyond, Kevin. Thanks. Now the system is working great. I heartily recommend this company.<//Review>

Got a quote and was extremely relieved that they said I didn't have to replace EVERYTHING (which all other quotes I got said I had to do). I will save more than half the cost by just replacing what they verified has gone bad, and can save the rest of the system for a future repair. I appreciate this kind of honesty and it makes me want to do business with a company like this.<//text>

<Text>After their technician Johnny came in and diagnosed the problem with my heating system, he suggested to replace the circuit pump. Few weeks later the part came in and he replaced it but there was still no hot air! Then he said the problem is with the water valves and I need to call a plumber to fix it. And still demanded me to pay $1200 for a service that has not fixed my problem. How unprofessional is this? I spoke to Ben in their office today and shamelessly he too wanted me to pay this amount!

I do not recommend anyone to use this company.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<text>Allen arrived and was very friendly.  He explained everything he intended  to check and thoroughly went about his business checking the AC refrigerant level and operating controls of the outside unit.  He gently washed the fins of the exterior unit for better air flow.

He also checked the forced air component inside and temperature levels coming from all room vents.  Very professional!</text>< Rating>

<Text>I continue to use Canoga Park Heating and Air Conditioning.  I own properties in California and Arizona where because of the locations I use other AC companies.  Canoga Park Air continues to offer the better quality and service.  Most recently CP Air installed a new 4 ton unit in Simi Valley.  The installation was done as promised.  The technicians used all the Covid safety precautions we hoped for as we are in the high risk category. The system works great.   I recommend this company without hesitation.< /Text>< pictures>

< Review>
Jose Bolanos was here to install our new NEST thermostat. He is super knowledgeable and friendly, and made sure that we knew how to use the Google Home app to adjust our thermostat when we’re away from home. As usual, our expectations were exceeded. That’s why we’ve been loyal customers for over eight years.</Review>

Has always done a diligent and an excellent job whenever he has come by for servicing our unit. He is a great asset to the company. He is consistent and has only gotten better over time.

When questioned about the problems he was looking for and what symptoms might develop he was quick to point out that the needed repairs should only be done by a qualified professional. What was even better was his more than favorable appreciation for his employer. Johnny is welcome to service our HVAC system any time.

<Review>Allen Serviced the air conditioning. He did a very thorough job: change the filter, check the condensation tube in the attic, check the coil, then check the condenser for Freon, then check all the registries for cool temperature. Never had any technician done this before. I am very happy with the service that Allen delivered.</Review><user_name>Catherine Lee</user_name><rating>5</rating>< Pics>

Great service. We found what we were looking for since we moved from West LA.
After 8 years struggling with another company we finally found Canoga Park Heating & Air Conditioner and we decided to stay with them on annual bases</Text>

I would get an estimate for repairs from the technician that came out but have to have a separate tech come out.  Since I don't yet own the home this is problematic!  In essence I paid to service the existing homeowners system and to learn what was wrong but without the estimate for the larger repair.

<review>Only wanted $85 service call!! I was told that the service charge would go towards any work I had done. Guy said he couldn’t give me a price to repair my unit because only people in the office can do that. Told me we needed our new thermostat wired correctly, I asked how much to do that he said $120 ok fine wire it correctly then and I’ll use the $85 service fee towards that. NO CAN DO! I’ve unplugged the system upstairs because the wires are bad. What does that have to do with you hooking up my new thermostats correctly???? So let me get this straight....you can’t give me a quote on repairing my system, you are refusing to do any work while your here, and you want me to pay you $85 which is supposed to go towards any work I have done, but yet you won’t do anything!! And you still think I should pay you!! No way. You completed wasted my time and only wanted to collect a fee for doing no work at all!!!!   Shame On You!!!<//review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<text>Jose B. is very friendly & professional. He called to see if he could come ahead of the scheduled appointment which was better for us. When he arrived he explained the procedures of what he was going to do. He was very efficient, and when he installed our Nest Thermostat he showed us, step by step, how to adjust the thermostat, and helped me put the app on my phone.  He was wonderful.</text><date>1532033323675<//date><gmapID>0x80c29c130a13496d:0x47ed47c9f3625480<//gmapID>< user>

Eddie the service tech did well, except for tracking leaves in. He was very helpful at explaining some things that I can do my self to save on $$. He was also friendly and good worker. Only trouble area is getting a receipt with my correct name and address on it. Started with wrong first name, last name, city, and zip on both billing and Job address. After three tries by email to get corrected receipt, they still have wrong first name on Job address, but I am giving up on it. I am glade Eddie's knowledge of AC is better than their ability to write receipts.</review>

Our heating unit went out on one of the coldest nights this winter.  This company couldn't initially come out the same day but while I was calling around, they called me back and was able to come out that morning. Their service man, Kevin, was very polite and efficient in assessing the problem. He had to order and pick up a part but was back as quickly as could be expected. He took care of the part installation and we were warming the house back up to a livable temperature in record time. I was very pleased with the result. Aloha to Ben who answered my phone call.</review>

The a/c tech from Canoga Heating and Air came out today to install our new Nest thermostat as part of DWPs program. Jose came out and did the installation and inspection of our system in about an hour and did the job efficiently and professionally. Based on Jose’s work, I would definitely call Canoga AC for repairs in the future.<//Text>

Eddie has been to my home to service my air conditioning/heater unit several times. He has always been on time, polite, knowledgeable, and professional.

A different tech recently visited my home. When I changed the filter myself months later, I noticed that he put it in upside down. This makes me wonder if he was competent in doing the other tasks that I am unable to check. I have contacted the company but  there has been no follow up from them.< /Text>

Canoga HVAC did an excellent job working through a complex problem with our Carrier system.  It's working great again.  Dependable and tenacious with hard to diagnose problems.</Review>

Normally a good company to service my AC, but this time I had my normal servicing and one week later my condensation wasn't coming through the outlet valve.  AC wasn't working, only pushing out warm air during a 113 degree day.  CPHAC doesn't work on the weekends and finding a reputable service company on the weekend wasn't easy.  I did get someone to come out at 7:30pm and fix it.  Should have been checked by Canoga Park Heating and Air.  Only reason for 3 stars is they are normally reliable.<//text>

CPHAC installed my central air system several years ago. Ever since, I have had them come out twice a year for maintenance, checkout & a filter change. As a result, my system always operates perfectly.

Thanks folks!</Review>

I am the second generation in my family to use Canoga Heating and Air.  They have always been spot on - since the 1970s - and Allen is the BEST! Fast, dependable, knowledgable and realistic.  He explains things, gives options and works fast.  I highly recommend Canoga Heating and Air and Allen!

I've worked with Allen in the past and today I found out he has retired.  Good for him - sad for me.  Then today I met Juan - WOW!  HE KNOWS WHAT HE IS DOING🤗   he works fast, takes time to explain issues; is neat and leaves the worplace pristine.  He is patient, polite and kind.  Please send him back to my house when needed.  He is great!<//Text>

Canoga Park Heating and Air is the most professional and honest service provider I have ever came into contact with. The fact thier service guts don't work off commission gives me a piece of mind that the service is done correctly without, "hey you need a new this or that." They come complete the service and educate me on how to conduct proper matianance in between our annual checkup.

Two thumbs up and highly recommend them for all your heating and AC needs.< /text>

Kevin Castro was the technician that serviced my air conditioner.  He found the problem quickly and ordered parts to complete the job.
He was courteous and respectful.

Canoga Heating and Air replaced our HVAC 15 years ago.  The installation was smooth sailing.  The system has been fantastic.  We have regular service.  The technicians are professional, courteous,  show up on time and they even wash the unit.  They always clean up after their work is done with a wonderful attitude. We usually get the same technicians.  Eddie just left,  he found a bad capacitor, he showed me how he tested it and he replaced it avoiding a system failure.  They are a family business and we feel like a part of their family.<//Review>

Leal came to my house for an estimate. He was very knowledgeable and gave me a ton of info. He was also very curteous and took off his shoes while inside the house. I’m eager to get my quote for my new AC unit.<//text>
