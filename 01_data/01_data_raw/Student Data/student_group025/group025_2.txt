After the snap, the repairman gave us options to take care of our problem. Gave us pricing up front. We felt confident in his knowledge and work performance. We will definitely be a repeat customer when needed.</review>

Kudos to both Rene and Greg for not only the professionalism but just as important, their respect and honor given to us. The latter is a quality that is not found much these days and trust me, it's extremely vital to we, the older generation.
My wife, Darlene, was so happy with the phone call made before Greg and Rene arrived.  We also appreciated the short time that was executed in the quality work provided for us.
I found both Greg and Rene to always be kind  and readily available whenever I asked questions about the processes entailed in the work to be done.
AQS is blessed to have these two gentlemen on board. They represent AQS with great value and a work ethic well above the norm.

Installers were professional and promptly placed the compressor and assessors related. They did a spotless cleanup. And now we have air.<//Text>

I had been told by another company that I needed to add refrigerant to my AC. This didn't sound right, so I called AQS for a second opinion. He came out and was very honest and professional. He let me know that did not need refrigerant. AQS has earned my business from now on.  I will not use anyone else for my home.< /review>

<Review>This company was called by our home warranty company. Our A/C was not working, the tech came out and said it was the fan compressor (the motor that makes the fan run). Which he did not have with him. How can you not have new motors either on your truck or at the shop? As an A/C company you should. Our A/C unit is 19 years old. The tech told me he was going to put a recommendation for a new unit but, mention what the problem was. Come to find out- he LIED. He did not put down the recommendation for a new unit like he told me. Don't tell me your going to recommend something and not.</Review><Date>1625360671465<//Date><rating>1< /rating>< gmapID>

I called AQS Heating and Air Conditioning to have my problem unit looked at. They told me a tech would call me shortly. I called back a few hour later and they told me the same thing. A tech would call me back shortly. It has been 6 days and I have still not been contacted. I had to call another company to evaluate my AC. They eneded up having to replace my unit. Im very disappointed at the service we received from AQC. I had my AC replaced by Goettl AC & Pluming. They were very fast professional and my house is cooler then ever. Thanks for nothing AQS!!!!</review>

< Review>
i am a on the fence about  recommending to go with AQS. I will say they are awesome at customer service. Their service managers (Elinore who has helped me) is top notch. and the installer (Rene) is great at his job.
Now to my experience and as to why i dont know whether to recommend or not to.
With the initial visit(THE QUOTE): the sales people were really cool and really good at their pitch. The one thing i would say is to make sure you know exactly what you are getting before they leave. i was quoted a price for a Rheem unit. Thinking i was getting a Rheem unit as promised i waited to see what was done after it was all installed.  I noticed they installed a RUUD unit. I called to express my concern and got the whole, RHEEM makes RUUD so its basically the same thing answer. so i feel i got charged for a RHEEM but got a RUUD. (OVERCHARGED)
The installation has not gone as smooth as i thought it was going to be. (maybe i was just the lucky one for all the problems to happen to).  Although all the issues that have came up after the install have been addressed and taken care of in a quick manner.
So overall, the air conditioner is working great and doing what it is supposed to do. All i can say is if you do decide to go with AQS, i just hope you have a better experience than i have had. I dont regret getting the ac unit because we really needed it but i do feel i got had a little bit.</Review>

I called an set an appt to get a quote for a new home HVAC system. During the call, I specifically asked if they service our area and was told yes. The morning of the appt, I received a call at 7am saying that they don't service my area. This outfit is poorly managed. Thank goodness I didn't purchase from them.</review>

March: My heat went out in the middle of the night. I made the call around 9:00 am and the technicians were at my house by 1:00pm. Even though they need to irder a replacement part, they were able to get it working while waiting for the part!!! They had it installed within a week, which is especially great since its in the 30-40's at night around here brrrrrrr

June Update: Here we are a few months later in the summer now and my AC goes out in the middle of a heat wave, 106° outside 92° in the house. Plus I have young children. I was able to get a next day appointment. My super  awesome tech Tyler came out and fixed everything in less than 30 minutes!!! This kind of heat can be deadly especially to toddlers so thank you from the bottom of my heart💗</review>

Jonathan came out and went through all the motions, explaining what he was doing and why.  He changed the motor speed several times and we decided that the original setting of high speed was the best. I still think something is wrong with the air flow, that it’s not blowing as hard or with as much force as it used to. I don’t think anyone is going to improve it. So I’m kinda stuck with it. Anyway Jonathan is a great asset to have as an employee....Thanks Jonathan!!!!!!< /Review>

I Highly Recommend Air Quality Specialists Inc. I appreciate that the company understood my health issues and promptly came to my home and fixed my issue with my Airconditioning system. Jonathan came fully in his mask and booties, for his and my protection. He was outstanding at his job, and very professional. He is a true asset to his company and represents them well. I will be using Air Quality Specialist Inc again.<//text>

How incredibly awesome and refreshing to have a company and serviceman (Mark) who follow through on what they say.  On time, presentable, friendly, professional, capable, polite - just all around wonderful.  People who know me know that I expect nothing less than what they say.  Being a Dr. I understand performance and insight into what clients are looking for.  I totally endorse this company!!!  I will continue to use and will refer, without hesitation, them to any and all who need an Air Conditioning company.  FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!<//review>

<rating>4< /rating><review>My a/c was blowing hot air. I called my home warranty and they said someone would be out that day but the company they assigned (AQS) actually could not. So we scheduled a day. They (Mark) came out and were on time, polite and communicated well. Unfortunately that first visit did not solve the problem so I followed up with home warranty and then was in contact with AQS again in which they again assigned Mark to service my home. Again. He communicated well and was on time and worked with my schedule. At this time hes saying it's the fan and a part needs to be ordered. I hope hes right. The job is not yet completed at this time but so fat Mark's communication has been great. My mom even had to meet him once and she said he was very polite.<//review>< Pics>

On Christmas Eve Mark showed up with a very positive and helpful attitude. He took his time to explain exactly what needed to happen and didn’t leave until the job was done properly. I can’t be more satisfied. If you want quality work that you can trust I definitely give my recommendations to this company.< /review>

My technician, Jonathan,  explained everything he was doing and why. He cleaned up my horrendously dirty motor and told me filters really do need to be changed quarterly. I was so impressed that I did pay for the non contractual monthly service fee. I will have my AC serviced with AQS before the heat of the summer.<//text>

The techs called ahead to let me know they were on their way. The techs arrived professionally dressed and respectful. The techs completed their work in a timely manner and cleaned up after themselves. Once the unit was installed, they made sure I understood the basics of operating it and getting it registered. The techs itemized my receipt and made sure I understood what was done and checked to see if I had questions. I'm a satisfied customer, and I believe with all confidence, if I have any questions or concerns, I can call the company for assistance!< /Review>

Mark and Eric came out to our business to repair our AC after speaking with Zayra the day prior, she made everything easy to schedule even at last minute . All were very courteous and helpful.
They had great communication with us and awesome attitudes. I would recommend this family owned company  to anyone I know. Thank you guys for coming out!< /review>

So pleased, I would highly recommend!!!
Mike came to my home as scheduled. My AC quit working 2days ago. It has been 87-93 degrees inside my home. He identified the problem within 5 mins. Thankfully, He had the part in his truck. He replaced the broken part, also replaced the broken thermostat inside my home. My AC is up, and running Beautifully!!!!
This is the company to call! Fast, efficient, reasonably priced and excellent customer service. A Big Thank you To AQS!
To MIKE SMITH the technician, YOU ROCK!!!
Thank you for your Knowledge, professionalism and kindness in explaining everything to me!!!
I will definitely be using your service again.

<GmapID>0x80db68b199659563:0xd6ea46042bf9841d< /GmapID><Review>I am very pleased with Mark's HONESTY. Most of all Mark's professional and thorough evaluation and beyond compassionate customer service. Less then 5 months ago. We purchased an older home. However, the older home passed a home inspection "with flying colors" per our realtor and home inspector...Im sure you know how the rest of the story goes...Anyways, thanks to Mark's professional and to the point evaluation and presentation, our home warranty company could not sly out of the responsibility to do whats under contract. I also want to commend Mark's help Christian, extremely polite, professional and hard working. Thank you AQS and Mark. God bless all of you always.<//Review>< Resp>

<text>We bought a home and completely remodeled it.  We had a home protection insurance policy.  Had a problem with the A/C.  The insurance company sent out an A/C rep to fix the problem...twice.  The problem persisted, and we called the insurance company and asked them to send out a different A/C company.  They sent out AQS.  Jose found the problem after a 2 minute search.  He showed me the problem, and the method to fix it. He completed the work within 5 minutes.

He was SO COMPETENT that it was actually embarrassing compared to the first company.  Jose listened carefully to the situation, and remedied the problem immediately.  He was very personable, straight forward, and we will "adopt" AQS as our regular A/C company going forward.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Eric the tech for our air conditioner was very knowledgeable of the problem and fixed it  asap. He was polite, and answered all our questions. In the future we will be using AQS because of the favorable attitude of Eric, and the AQS company.<//Text>

My a/c unit went down in the middle of this summers heat wave. AQS was able to come out right away, diagnose the problem and the repairs made quickly. I couldn’t be more happy with the quality and care the guys at AQS gave me.  Thanks to them my family was able to relax and enjoy a cool house once again. I highly recommend AQS and would definitely refer them to any friends or family who have home heating or air conditioning problems!</text>

WONDERFUL! Out of three companies assigned by my warranty service, only Carole and Marc communicated with me! Carole to schedule the appointment that was escalated to an emergency (no AC for four days in a heat wave), but Mark called to alert me to his arrival. He was a joy while assessing and repairing the issue. I cannot thank them enough, mainly for the customer service and attention to the dire aspect of my situation.<//review>

I have never had a good experience with air conditioner maitance people until I found AQS Heating and Air.  Their technician Mark was so knowledgeable and took extra time to explain why our unit was leaking.  He even took the time to educate us on the best air filter for our unit.

We would waive the $77 fee if the repair was related to our previous repair but if the problem was not related, their would be charge.

This company was contracted by my home warranty company. All I can say is - RUN!
Everything started off fine with this Company diagnosing the problem. However, once the work needed to be done, there were nothing but problems. My home warranty company called me and told me my uncovered charges out of pocket totaled $900. I asked my home warranty company to provide an itemized estimate of what was being charged to include what the warranty company would be covering. The warranty company stated I had to call the vendor (this shop) and request the information. I  called this company and they told me they were under no obligation to provide anything to me because the warranty company was their client and I was not. Of course, it is unlawful for any Contractor to perform work without entering into a binding agreement with the consumer, which includes detailing the charges in writing.
Finally, after much battling, a manager with the home warranty company contacted their offices and field rep to request this company send me something in writing. I did receive an invoice, which was not itemized and was only for my charges, which stated $900. In a separate conversation, I spoke with Mike at this company who said I could “elect” to pay an additional $1150 for a HERS test, or I could find my own company for half the price. This was new information to me at the time due to not previously being disclosed on the estimate for $900. I still did not have the detailed estimate of all charges - to me and the home warranty company.
Finally, Ariana called me to schedule an appointment to complete the work and, at that time, told me $2,050 was due upon completion. I questioned this because that’s not what I had been told. I also raised the issue that I STILL hadn’t received an itemized estimate for all the work being done. She said the $2,050 was for the $900 noncovered charged, and $1150 for a permit! Permit?! This was news to me again! My estimate stated within the $900, the permit was covered! When discussing the estimate, Ariana stated she had no knowledge of what the home warranty  was paying. I asked her how is it possible they don’t know what charges the home warranty company is covering if they are doing the job. None of it made any sense. She couldn’t answer my questions, said she would have her manager call me, and after my numerous requests to proceed with scheduling the appointment  while we work through the issues in tandem, she refused.
Mike, the manager, called me the next business day to talk through everything yet he was rude, belligerent, would not listen to a word I was saying while talking over me, and didn’t tell me anything outside of the HERS test and permit are the same charge. Interesting, as they are two entirely different things and one was optional (HERS test), per Mike, while the other was due and payable upon completion per Ariana (Permit). Mike still would not schedule the appointment, explain why I could not receive all the charges in writing, and animatedly refused as I offered we call the home warranty company together to work through a resolution.
His next call was to the home warranty company wherein which he refused to complete the work.
All-in-all, this company and their employees morals, ethics, and manners are questionable.</Text>

I’m remodeling a 2000 sf house in Hemet and needed a new heating and air conditioning system. I got a few quotes from different HVAC companies and decided to go with AQS because they had a good price and had good ideas on how to install the system without having to do extra work. They showed up with a crew of 6 guys and a crane and finished everything in one day. Everyone on the crew was very professional and they did a great job.</text>

This company is by far the best company I have delt with, I have been with several different company's before but this company topped them all! They are a small company so it did take a little longer but the customer service was phenomenal being that it was summer, a very busy time. I will definitely recommend this company to all of my friends and family!</text>

<Name>Laurie Rexford< /Name><Text>Republic Home Protection Company uses this company.  A specialist came out to fix our air conditioner.  He was not listening to anything I said.  There is a slight amount of air coming through the vents so he said the air conditioner was working. He told me my daughters upstairs bedroom was 90 plus degrees because she had a wall facing the west.  My upstairs bedroom was 90 plus because I had high ceilings.   I had to argue with him to look at the vents to see what the problem was with the air flow.  There is not enough air to cool a barbie house...and they are taking weeks because I do not want strangers in my home at 8:00 pm.

He had another appointment but returned at 5:00 to make sure our problem was fixed and the air was running for us. He is always easy to get along with and quick to figure out the problem.

OUR HOME WARRANTY HAD THEM COME OUT TO REPLACE OUR THERMOSTAT AND NOT WAITING AROUND UNTIL THEY MADE SURE IT WORKED CORRECTLY THEY LEFT.  THE HEAT CAME ON INSTEAD OF THE AIR CONDITIONING.  WHO WANTS HEAT WHEN ITS 110* OUTSIDE. OF COURSE IT WAS A DAY BEFORE THE HOLIDAY AND THEY WOULDN''T COME ON A HOLIDAY TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  WE HAD TO GET A HOTEL BECAUSE OF OUR DOG.  I CALLED TO ASK IF THEY WOULD REIMBURSE ME FOR THE HOTEL AND THEY WOULD NOT BECAUSE IT WASN'T THEIR PROBLEM.  THEIR TECH DID HIS JOB CORRECTLY THE FIRST TIME AROUND.  REALLY!!!  STICK AROUND 5 -10 MINUTES TO MAKE SURE COOL AIR IS COMING OUT AND NOT HEAT.
I CALLED AND LEFT A FEW MESSAGES ON MONDAY, I DIDN'T GET A RETURN PHONE CALL TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT  UNTIL AFTER THE TECH CAME AND FIXED HIS MISTAKE.   HAD TO GIVE THEM ONE STAR, I COULDN'T POST WITHOUT ONE.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>This company is absolutely terrible. They have the worst customer service I have ever experienced. It took them 5 weeks to INCORRECTLY indentify our a/c problem. After being jerked around for over a month, we decided to call a different company. Within 2 hours our a/c was fixed and running fine. Do not use these people EVER. Save yourself the trouble and call ANYONE ELSE !</Review>< pictures>

<Text>Fidelity Home Warranty sent out this unprofessional company to have the technician tell me to my face that "only" the compressor needed to be replaced. After waiting a couple of days, Fidelity Home Warranty called me to tell me that the technician who came to my house recommended that the condensing unit needed to be replaced due to a leak in the system. I watched the technician as he diagnosed the problem, and he did not even hook up freon gauges to the compressor / condensor. I know enough to know that this company is up-selling to the warranty company to beef up there total bill. The warranty company also told me that there was going to be certain charges that would "not" be covered. Jennifer, from Fidelity Home Warranty tried to get me to believe that the compressor and the condensor was one in the same part. This will definitely be posted on Angie's List and any other place that can warn home owners to not let these crooks into there home! I would like to post zero stars!<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>
{'time': 1503095599221, 'text': "Thank you for your feedback. We take all comments very seriously and strive to achieve the highest level of customer service. Looking into your system which is a 2004 model makes it 13 years old. The compressor has failed and we also identify the reason why the compressor failed. The failure appeared to be caused by lack of freon at one point or another. If we did not explain this to you in detail we apologize. Based on this information we don't believe that replacing the compressor would be in your best interest. It is very possible that it will not solve the issue of  the condenser not working and would require additional repairs that would cost you more in the long run. If we replace the compressor, there is a 1 year warranty on the compressor only, if we replace the condenser, there is a 10 year warranty on the entire unit. So we believe if we replace just the compressor we would be doing you an injustice. Please feel free to call us to discuss in further detail."}<//Resp>

< Review>
Finally. A contractor that works excellent with us and our home warranty. My wife and I have First American Home Warranty, so 3rd party contractors have to be assigned. Our air condition and heating HVAC broke down. We were first given Platinum Repair and let me warn you... the worst experience from A thru Z. We had enough and requested First American to change contractors, so then they assigned Air Quality.

What a blessing and DRAMATIC difference in customer service, knowledge, communication, and customer satisfcation compared to Platinum Repair. Marc and Areana were extremely helpful in resolving this claim. Heater works and can't be happier. In addition, technician even threw in a few tips for maintaining the HVAC to lessen damages. This just took one visit versus the other company which had 3 visits and were literally a bunch of clowns (Platinum Repair representative always had no clue what was going on and would never get you in touch with her supervisor... such a pain, seriously).

Want professionalism and results? Want a smooth transaction without any headaches?
Have your Home warranty request for Air Quality and you'll have a great experience. Don't make my same mistake and get stuck with another company like Platinum Repair.<//Review>

<user>110530229476013723861</user><user_name>Marianne Roth< /user_name><Date>1501888871121</Date><Rate>1< /Rate><review>I would never recommend this company!  AVOID THEM AT ALL COST!  We  unfortunately have a home warranty  that uses this unscrupulous company as their service provider.  We have not had AC service in our home since 6/18/17.  First they said we needed a new condenser.  It was covered by warranty, however, AQS would not provide service until we guaranteed we would pay an additional $1050 that supposedly was not covered by our warranty.  At this point, we were without air for 30 days, so, we agreed.  The technician came out and immediately had us sign an empty invoice and began working.  5 hours later he said he was finished and asked for payment, he said it would cool down in 30 minutes and left.  IT NEVER WORKED!

They came back 2 days later and at this point our new condenser was frozen in 110 degree heat.  They said they couldn't diagnose the problem.  We asked if they could come back that afternoon or on Saturday.  AQS doesn't work on weekends, he said.  If you look at other reviews, you will see that they do indeed work on Saturdays!  Another one of their many lies.

When it was finally diagnosed again, we were told we needed a new air handler now!  We were told we would be a priority.  That was on Wednesday.  It took another 6 days for them to finally come back!  When they did, it was at 4:30 in the afternoon.  They were "fixing" the problem until 9:30.  We were told it was finished and the installer wanted us to sign the invoice stating it was complete. At this point, it was still 95 degrees inside the room.  My husband asked for him to wait 30 minutes to see if it was cooled.  He was unwilling.  My husband said he would give them another payment of $400, but, would not sign that service was complete.  The installer said, "I did my job!  Enjoy the heat!", gave us back the check and drove off.  Incredibly rude!  My husband called AQS and asked for them to call us in the morning.  We didn't get a call.  My husband called 6X and they would not return a call on service performed.  BOTTOM LINE ... THEY DON'T STAND BY THEIR SERVICE!

Oh, by this point, my husband checked the AC and it wouldn't even turn on.  IMPORTANT POINT!

We finally contacted the corporate office of our home warranty and she told us to hire another contractor and they would reimburse us.  She couldn't reach them either!

Mike Hernandez finally called and refuted everything my husband told him.  He said there was a part needed and they would come out again tomorrow.  We said no thanks ...

Simmons AC was called at 3:30 Wednesday afternoon.  Simmons was at our home at 5:00 pm.  By 6:00 pm we had air.  Quickly fixed our problem that AQS couldn't do for 60 days.  Plus, they were on time and courteous.

WE FOUND OUT WHY OUR AC WOULDN'T TURN ON AFTER AQS TECHNICIAN LEFT OUR HOUSE.  AT SOME POINT, OUR DISCONNECT SWITCH WENT "MISSING!"

Whatever you do, STEER CLEAR OF THIS COMPANY!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>
{'time': 1501898110639, 'text': 'Thank you for your review. At AQS safety comes first for our staff  and they are instructed to leave when a situation becomes hostile. Our procedures when completing the install are to have paperwork signed,  collect the payment and go over the start up procedures with homeowner. When we proceeded to do this, the homeowner took the techs biller, refused to return it, refused to sign the paperwork, and presented the tech a blank check that did not have his signature on it or the payment amount. The tech then instructed the homeowner that without completing these steps we would not be able to complete the start up procedure. At this point the husband and son threatened our tech with violence, so the tech left.  No one should have to tolerate this behavior. Because the homeowner did not include this in their review, we felt it was necessary to provide all the details. When working with home warranty companies, there are additional steps involved that require approvals. Once the approvals from the home warranty are completed, then the equipment is ordered by the warranty company and shipped to our shop. This process does create additional time involved in completion of the job.'}</resp>

Nearing a month now since this company was called in to repair my AC and still not working. Waited a week for them to show up, a week for them to come back when the first repair lasted only a few hours, waited another week for the wrong part to come in, now waiting another week for hopefully the right part...this place is a joke, unfortunately this is who my warranty company works with, needless to say I will be going with a different warranty company when my plan expires next month...</text>

I honestly love coming to this office and the care I get when I do!

I had tried seeing a chiropractor once about 8 years ago but didn't get much benefit out of it and didn't really see the value at the time. I'm glad to report that this office has since changed my mind! Between the wonderful chiropractic doctors and the amazing massage therapists, there are no lasting issues from a car accident I had been in before I started coming here but I also no longer have certain pains that I had suffered for over a decade.

I've had a wonderful experience every time I've gone in and everyone is so friendly and helpful! I love going for my appointments and I'm sure you will too. If you're looking for good chiropractic care, check this place out.<//text>

I've been a patient for over 20 years and I've always believed in the the care and support I get from staff and doctors.  I'd rather have chiropractic care for back, shoulder, leg pain, than going to the traditional doctor for pain meds. The results are faster and true, rather than a pill to mask a problem, which also means  I feel better without side effects.</text>

I've known Dr. John for over 20 years and seen his practice and techniques just continue to get better.  He now uses an "activator" more often than manual adjustments.  I was skeptical but this is FAR gentler and  in my opinion more effective.</text>

Vallejo Chiropractic is the best. The receptionists always greet you as soon as you walk in and are really nice and helpful. They help you sign in and even to make your next appointment before you leave. This is certainly the place to go for adjustments, they always have me feeling great! Highly recommend this place.<//Text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>Very irritated. First appointment visit for my wife was supposed to be $68. Front desk said $100 because it covers 3 x 15 minutes massages for the first 3 visits. She's not there to be massaged. She's there to be adjusted (never had this issue with a chiropractor). Then they said the appointment was at 4pm. My wife asked if she would be out by 5pm for work and the lady said she would. 4:30pm and shes still in the waiting room, even though she came 10 minutes early! Then, the chiropractor says he wants to see her next week because she has a lot wrong with her. She just turned 34 today, is active, flexible, healthy, etc., and there's a lot wrong with her? Then, I needed to make an appointment for her for something that deals with her sinuses at the hospital we go to where everything is covered. This hack tells her to not make the appointment yet because they offer services to help with that, which our insurance wont cover, so that would be more out of pocket. I don't trust this place ONE BIT!!! The only reason that I didnt give them worse of a review (besides that google wont let you do 0 stars) is because they did adjust her well. So, apparently, they do good work. They just lie to you about the cost, the time, and are there more for your money than your benefit. If my wife does go again, I will be there so she wont get screwed, but dont count on it.< /Text>< user_name>

I started receiving services in 1998 after an injury. I am very proud to give A 5 star rating. Vallejo Chiropractor is second to none. This also represents American Canyon Chiropractic. Diana L.< /review>

I love that they also will work with people without insurance or can't afford the high cost of medicine. Also Saturday appointments are awesome!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

I have been a patient of Dr. James since 2016. I had a lot of neck and shoulder issues. My daily pain levels have been greatly reduced. The staff is friendly and great to work with. I really recommend getting a 15 minute massage before your adjustment. Beau is especially awesome!<//Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Finding Vallejo Chiropractic has allowed me to get my mobility back.
Afer slipping down my stairs, I found I was not able to walk more than 800 steps a day with out experiencing extreme pain. After only four adjuments, I felt like a was ready to conquer the world.
Of course additional treatments were needed, but going from a 10 pain level to 4-5 on my worse days - gave my life back. The staff are friendly and Dr. James always greets me with a smile. Each week he ensured me I would achieve my 10,000 steps per day with continued care. I have reach my goal and I could not be more grateful for the care I received.
On weeks that I am feeling wound up, Beau is a great massage therapist. Gentle and always willing to work on the sore areas.
I could not ask for more caring people. Extremely satisfied!! Thank you........< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>The best in the world, I have been in pain so many times.  I just showed up on the doorstep and walked out of there in so much relief I couldn't believe it. I couldn't recommend it more to anyone who suffering
I'm bringing my friend in, who is never seen or been to a chiropractor and believe me it took a lot of convincing. But I know for a fact she's gonna feel so much better. Just go you won't regret it for a minute< /Review>< pictures>

I went to for other chiropractors before I discovered Vallejo chiropractic. These guys really know what they’re doing, and they use an evaluation system I’ve never experienced with any other chiropractors.< /Review>

I had a back injury about 13 years ago and have seen 3 other chiropractors in the past, all 3 telling me I had no way of relieving the pain unless I saw them every 2 weeks. A friend then suggest I come to Vallejo Chiropractic and see Dr. Harrington. My goodness, this man and his colleagues, all of the same pedigree in their specialties, have been able to relieve my back pain. Doc told me his goal is to not see me. Within the first 3 months, he was able to get my visits down to every 7 weeks. They have helped me through a sciatica attack and through 9 months of my pregnancy and now 6 months post partum. I love what they offer and will continue to come here for years to come.< /Text>

It's more than chiropractic care, it's total body care! I have a degenerative disc in my back and two bulging discs in my neck, and that can make it rough sometimes working as a lineman, but these guys keep me going. They have three doctors but I've only seen two, Dr John and Dr James. Using the body scan method they can pinpoint where things are out of alignment and make the necessary corrections with the Activator which makes micro adjustments or they can do a good old fashioned manual adjustment. I usually opt for the Activator, unless I feel the need for a little more and go with a manual or drop table. All the massage therapist are good and have their own unique style. Beau has recently started taping my back which has surprisingly helped. Shanon has a one of a kind massage technique that completely relaxes your body and her hour massage is well worth the price. So there are a lot of options to get your body working and feeling better.lo<//review>

Menudo isn't the greatest. Not as flavorful as other places. Also pretty pricey to be paying to go and not get a proper hot soup spoon to eat it. Spoon was small and almost melting.< /review>

I waited 20mins for the very WORST menudo.. I told the lady no worries tale your time so I was in no hurry I sat in my car. I don't understand how I was charged so much for under cooked menudo and no flavor. I feel very wrong by the place and i heard good thing😠< /Text>

<Text>I ordered a menudo which was very bland. My dad had the liver and onions, the onions were burnt and the liver was rubbery. The waitress was unfriendly, when I said good morning to her she did not respond, she only stared at me with a bothered look. Will not go back.</Text></record>

<review>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Food is very tasty. I had the red chilaquiles, almost like mom's. Portions are perfect... Literally I cleaned my plate out. Not like other restaurant that fill your plates with rice and beans or lettuce.
⭐⭐⭐⭐Place is small but feels homely. Cozy I might say. 5 booths and 3 tables. Outside sitting. Somewhat clean. Parking is limited.
⭐⭐⭐Customer servive. Waitress a bit dull in personality. But did refilled our coffee and asked if we needed anything else.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Our family loves this place. It's a locals place. The food is verrrrrry good and it inexpensive too. They have an all you can eat for about $10 and everything on the all you can eat menu is made to order, the food is not sitting there under heat lamps. Their menudo is the bomb. They seem to always sell out. It's nothing fancy. It's just good food at a great price.<//review>

The service is slow she takes forever to refill the chips drinks and get the next round of orders. And when you do ask her for a refill its like she has to go across the street to get the stuff. Im here today it after she took the order we waited 30 min for our salads and no chip or drink refills in between. Food is the only reason i gave it a 2 instead of a 1. The server brings down the whole experience. She literally is the creater of the RBF (Resting B*tch Face)</text>< Pics>

<text>This is one of my favorite churches for a number of reasons. There is a huge parking lot, many benches inside, the community is always active and involved, and those giving the sermon are very kind and welcoming. It's also very big inside making the feeling of going to church very appealing. Definitely recommend this church to anyone.</text></record>

<Text>Had my Ford F250 Rear window with slider replaced. Paul did a great job and got the Ford Factory Tint window ordered and installed at my house in under a week. Didn't even have to miss a day of work. He showed up and had it done in about a hr. Awesome service, awesome price. Just recently talked my father in law to call Paul and have him quote him for replacement rear window on his Chevy Truck. He wanted a rear slider and Paul gave him a better deal then the previous quote he got. Plus he comes to you to do the window. 100% recommend this service. Ill be using these guys to do my front window on my truck and Car here soon. Awesome people! Have had my rear window on my truck for over a year now and it all still looks brand new.<//Text>< Rating>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I feel so fortunate to have run into Paul, the Fixx AutoGlass proprietor, at a store parking lot. I'm even more glad that  I asked him about his business services.  Even though he was apparently busy taking care of his personal shopping needs, Paul took a few minutes to help me and he gave me a quote right on the spot.  My windshield had cracked over a year ago, but I had held off on having it fixed, initially because the dealer quoted me three times as much as Paul had quoted.    Needless to say, he comes right to your house (or any other preferred location) and gets the job done--paying attention to every detail, including replacing the oil service sticker that was on my old windshield.  He is friendly and very professional and a I cannot say enough good things about my overall experience.< /text>< Pics>

They use factory replacement windshield. came to my house were done in less than 2 hours and charged me less than half of what the idiots at safelite wanted. Safelite wanted over $800 while these Professionals did it in my driveway for 300 plus dollars outstanding job would recommend them to anyone< /Text>

I was really nervous about the process of having my window replaced.  I called several places for quotes and they were either unavailable or expensive.
Then I called Fixx Auto Glass Mobile and spoke to Paul.  He said he could repair my window the next day and he would come to me.
The service was great and the price was superb.  Paul put my mind at ease.<//review>

<Text>Paul was great!  He cane recommended by my insurance company, so I knew he a great reputation.  And he didn’t disappoint!  He was on time, got done very quickly, answered a bunch of my questions, and was very comparatively priced.  I would highly recommend FIXX Auto Glass 🤩< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80c2500b69e55555:0x3105c46d7bb8f695< /Gmap_id></record>

Great price, called other places and was to expensive. His price is very reasonable. Also he installed window faster then I expected, which was very great! Also was understanding with making appointments in the afternoon. The best Part is that he comes to you 🙌. Will definitely be recommending to friends and family.<//Review>

I called this guy on a Sunday and set up  an appointment for Tuesday. I called him 30 mins before my appointment time and he ignored my phone calls. He also never called me back and I really needed my windshield replaced. There are better places that are cheaper than this and will repair it same day. Don’t waste your time. This dude is unprofessional and will try to overcharge for other people’s mistakes.< /Text>

I called up Paul at 11 am after busting out my passenger window on a Sunday morning and had an existing crack in my windshield, he had the glass in stock and had the passenger window and windshield replaced before 3pm! He is professional, quick, and most importantly had me taken care of in under 4 hours. I didn't even have to leave home! 10/10 would recommend to others and will be using him in the future if I ever need any Auto Glass taken care of in the future.</Review>

I've lived down the road from this market for my entire life, and have had nothing but great experiences. They have a pretty wide variety of items for it's size, and the people who work there are always very friendly. Plus, they always have a trivia question that you can answer for candy. Can't recommend it enough!< /review>

This was a lucky turn off the road for me during my drive from Palm Springs to San Diego. It was a nice place to stop for a minute and see what there is to see. A nice walk led you through the desert landscape with plenty of informational placards explaining the indigenous peoples of the area, their lives, histories, and how they exist today. The most interesting part was the information about the singing and the speaker that played 2 different songs. I really enjoyed listening and being there.</Text>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Review>A great place to stop along the road for some panoramic views of the mountains and valleys. It was very windy when we stopped to explore, so we didn’t stay for long, but it’s a great place to shoot a few pictures and relax for a few minutes.
There is a large viewing platform and plenty of parking.</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNSgky5rcRWlntDEYDJ07VrlIRgeUP66b_0C0s7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQL2Ofsgb-LQvD8zqub956OiyQfoYajSfvuMWd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFf51kbx302_0u1HL8SW7yoYy9UpifFr5utFwe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtDhvZYCClJIRyaZ4R1EXh8v1Xy9SJTSOcXVrX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Worth for the scenic drive on Hwy 74 south of Palm Desert. Once at the point, there's a parking area and a paved trail for a few God viewpoints. An easy nature trail forks from here which is highly recommended to experience close the beautiful desert vegetation.< /review>

The view is nice from the marked paved trail.  The view is better if you take the short dirt trail or longer trails.  There is a lot to see in the canyons and mountainsides.< /Text>

A great vista point with some incredible Native history of the land. There is a short paved walkway leading to the Vista Point and a secondary nature trail off of the paved trail. The history of this land and it's past are shared throughout the short trail.< /review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Beautiful little road-side pull-out along the Palms-to-Pines Highway.  I'll mention right away that this parking area has a garbage can to dispose of your travelling trash (that's what I call the small incidental stuff that you generate while on a road trip).  This is a big deal, as I've found here in southern California - there are a few pull-outs that don't provide any garbage disposal, ie: garbage can would be a good start, and travellers just throw their junk around the parking lots.  That's pretty sad, when you're in a scenic overlook, and all you see is garbage blowing around.  Having said that, THIS vista point does have garbage cans, and it's a nice clean area - with some easy walks from the parking area to the vista points.  This was a joy to stop at and stretch our legs, breathe in some really fresh air, and on our way again.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWA-OksH84_MYv05_f66tprTeqzE9V6J8IT0H7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlzloiMfVLFk_tUD61ezZ_G8FENu45JIITnyLL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM14RHYW-Wvqwf9QC9WJh8uTSwcApGiA3gwvUdn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOkwb2pEfXokvO0HwwcIne3l7SZIUsm-b22m_a3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9MUaz8FlOVqkCQeBKHMhxem6weRZ1DsY5eBhg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7jqBHf9nW0C1NcHeHprKxNiPvVjITCvTl0hTx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfNX0bcb7NlhE3RIiDSGc8GLH7MYJDkK0TqcTU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3KiX7s_gmRYUCtTEd0Tf9pu1Vqh8JCczE8ap0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAZ0F9RPOoMbjmhsAe6thO2AgNgOiFEqgFJDYQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfhiIw2cLeTVEAo_cAOSxSGWV60C4IopY7OUpf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80dbab2e8f2cbc1d:0x1b53ec328310477<//gmapID></record>

<text>Such a beautiful area, deep in history of the Great Cahuilla people who inhabited these lands long before the European invasion. They have a lookout at the end of the trail where you can hear authentic Cahuillan bird songs sang by elders. It is worth the visit!< /text>< Pics>

<Name>JoDee Hunter< /Name><Review>Great viewpoint filled with educational posts along the way.  At the look out, they have a button that,  when pressed,  plays natives singing bird songs which was really unexpected and cool.  Others pressed this button while we were walking the path towards the look out and we were thrown by hearing native voices singing in the valley.  Super cool touch!

This is a really great and worthy place to stop there is a little trail that you follow out to overlook a beautiful mountain view with an optional music by the tribe to play while reading about the mountain range and how the cahuilla tribe lived off of the land it really is awing.<//review>

Just a few miles past the more popular Vista Point, this Vista point allows you to take a moment appreciating the unmolested view. No city sprawls before you, just the Santa Rosa mountains. Much quieter, great hiking (don't go alone) as the trails are rugged.<//review>

Awesome spot along the "Pines to Palms" highway. Was pretty empty when we stopped. Offers great views of desert canyons and plant life. Very quiet if you walk down away from the road. We saw a couple with folding chairs set up by the edge of a cliff with a view and some beers!< /Text>

A great place to stop in the middle of the desert. Very instructive about the native peoples who lived there before, and currently live in the area.< /review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>During some of our roadtrips we purposely like to look for lookouts or view points or lookouts just to look at the areas and learn more about the scenery and area. One of my favorites, which I discover a couple years ago is an area on Hyw 74 in California known as the Palms to Pines Highway. There are actually two view points in the area. The Cochella Valley Vista Point which is the more popular stop and The Cahuilla Tewanet Vista Point.  To us it's important to make these stop because you can find some information about that area.

These were taken at the Cahuilla Tewanet Vista Point. This vista point is great not only for its views but also the information it gives on the Mukat people of the Agua Caliente band of Cahuilla Indians. The views of the beautiful mountains and desert landscape was a wonderful mix. I did a little research on the Cahuilla Indians and it was interesting to find out that they used bird songs to teach their young their language and they called the area of Palm Springs "Sec-he which means "boiling Water".</Text>< pictures>

Can’t say enough good things about Jimmy and his mechanics. I’ve been taking my cars to National for about 10 years now. Before their services I had been from shop to shop looking for an honest reliable mechanic.Their honesty and professionalism will continue to have my trust in my cars needs. Before you take it anywhere try them first. Highly recommend< /Text>

< Review>
There is a reason why I only take my car here now. I always call ahead and they are nothing but kind reasonable and professional. They have worked on all the cars I have owned and I will always go to them no matter what. The owner is amazing and is very understanding. And the technicians do fabulous work. The tall lanky man is very very respectful and only touches what he needs to. And treated all my cars with the respect I would give them. I can honestly say all the bad reviews are garbage.</Review>

<Review>I had a engine replaced in a SUV in 2012 it was like new!  It still runs great!  I have come in for a few other maintenance issues as well but do not live in town.  I recently had a water pump replaced in my truck and they did it quickly and at a reasonable price. It is a family owned business and  most of the employees work hard to to do a good job. So far I am a happy customer!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

< Review>
These guys are terrific. Had an overheating problem with an 04 Jaguar.  They narrowed it down right away, but I got in the way and tried to order parts from an aftermarket distributor

<review>Moses & his team at National are honest, friendly & go out of their way to help you! I am new to the area but have used them several times.  They will take a look at your car right away & let you know the REAL problem!! There is NO shady stuff going on there, you will get a TRUE answer of what is wrong & they work quickly to fix it! Its a family business that makes you feel like family too! They take great care of you.< /review>< username>

< Review>
I've been a customer for years.   Jamie the owner takes great care of me and my vehicles.  They get busy so once in a while a repair may take a little longer but the mechanics are good and honest so it's worth the wait.    As a small business owner i support small businesses.</Review>

I went to National and they looked at my 3 car issues and I thought that they had fixed my 2 separate problems alot cheaper and faster than the other guy. I have had to take my car back 3 times. I broke down in the Ortegas because they did not replace the old clamps on my new radiator and when I told them I had to have it towed and fixed in Orange county they did not even apolize. NEVER GO THERE! I spent $950.00 there for 3 things to be repaired and 2 of them have had to be repaired AGAIN with someone else< /Text><time>1499884962869</time><response>None<//response><name>Angel S</name><pictures>None<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

I request crubside since that is the option on the site. I arrived, called, turned on my headlights and waited for my pizza. I was told that they would bring it right out. 10 minutes later another car pulls up and gets assisted right away and gets their pizza. The person bringing out the pizza then comes to my car because he can see I am upset I askes where the heck is my pizza. I paid online and even tipped. Going forward I'm not going to tip ahead of time because I never know if I'm ever going to get my pizza.<//Review>

#The best pizza I ate in Lake Forest/Irvine area. I met one of their driver in gas station and I ask them about their logo and it seems they are pretty old shop and I got there and had a stuffed pizza. "No comments" just amazing. It's a local restaurant and little expensive so when you have any event and you wanna spend some money on a Quality food, "THIS IS YOUR PLACE".<//text>

I definitely think this is our new local pizza place!
Ordered online for curbside pickup and Eric came out to let me know the order would be ready in a few minutes. Gave us breadsticks on the house because I joined the rewards system but my phone wouldn't download the app.
The breadsticks were delicious! The pizza was gorgeous too and hot! Good value for money too.
We'll be back next week!<//text>

You can tell when you pick up the box, because it is heavy, that you are getting a good pizza. They put a lot of toppings and a generous helping of cheese on all their pizzas. They also have good salads and pasta. I usually get a pitcher of cold beer to go along with my pizza. This store did not disappoint me. I got a great pizza with fast and friendly service.

Last minute food decision, 15 mins prior to closing, and the gentleman that was there Friday night ( Valentine's day) was more than willing to make sure my order was completed, but also there was a family still eating past close!
Not saying this, to tell you to wait till the last minute! Just to say having someone like that means great service any other time!!
The pizza was made to order! And was delicious! ( Which was the only thing I ordered!)
Would definitely recommend this location!< /text>

I'm not sure if all locations have lost that cozy feel or just this location. $40+ for a large pizza and wings with no drinks is expensive too.  When we first walked into the restaurant, it smelled like a vinegary sewage leak was happening.  The wings were very good and spicy hot.  The pizza was good, but not as good as I remembered or would hope for the big price.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

A few weeks ago we ordered delivery and there was some confusion on the delivery time. I left a review on another site and Eric the manager saw it and called me to make things better. Eric was amazing and offered us a free large pizza as well as a salad. Great customer service and management by Eric. Definitely will be going back, my boys think its the best pizza around.</review>

Service was excellent! Eric helped us out here and made us feel at home. :) The lunch buffet is such a great deal, fresh salad, the best pizza around! Really enjoyed, really impressed. Also, great beer on tap varieties. :)</review>

This was my first Round Table Experience.

Location: 27472 Portola Pkwy, Foothill Ranch.
Staff: Erick provided superb unforgettable service! RT is blessed to have him on the team, for his hospitality is bring my family back. His top knowledge of the menu lead to a delicious recommendation. We decided on the Family Special #1.
Food: Arrived hot and in a timely manner. Pizza had ample toppings and cooked perfectly. I LOVE that the bottom of the pizza was crispy. RT has a great sauce. The food presentation was clean and picture perfect. The RT cooks most definitely delivered!     Cleanliness: Hand Sanitizer is provide at the register. Erick disinfected the pen before handing it to me to sign the receipt. Store looked cleaned and beverage station was stocked. Dining room was closed due to COVID19.
Parking: There is plenty of parking in the plaza. The designated curbside pick up was clearly marked in front of the store.
Overall Experience: Was excellent. William Larson would be proud of the scervice and standard this store is providing. I look forward to supporting our local RT in our community.< /text>

This is absolutely one of the best round table pizzas I have ever been to. The manager Erick is the sweetest man ever and deeply cares about his customers. You know when Erick is working that day because the place just runs flawlessly. I come here every week with my boyfriend and have been to many other round tables in California and in many different states. This is by far my FAVORITE one to go to.<//Review>

<Text>This location was recently renovated and it looks pretty good. The staff is nice and the restaurant is clean. My coworkers and I sometimes come here for their lunch special. $8.99 for all you can eat pizza, salad, and a drink. They are constantly bringing out different pizzas so it is nice.

Edit: Wish I could add this place an extra star. The manager's customer service is awesome. I asked if they offered vegetarian pizza and even though they had one there already he made sure once a new pizza was ready to come to my seat and offer some. He served all of us fresh pizza. It was great!< /Text>< pictures>

I had came down from Palmdale Ca for a soccer tournament, and in my spare time I  went round-table pizza in Foothill Ranch. I must say the manager Eric was amazing! He went above and beyond for me and the rest of the customers there. I highly recommend the Foothill Ranch location if Eric is working.<//review>

I was amazed today by the service here. I came for lunch buffet and after I ordered it the cashier asked what kind of pizza I wanted. I responded oh I just ordered the buffet and she replied yes what do you like on your pizza, so I said pepperoni, sausage, and jalepenos and they made A full pizza for me and put what I didn't eat at the buffet. Food was good , staff was awesome I will be back for lunch for sure.< /Review>

Good pizza but the lunch buffet is not worth it. When I went they only had 2 slices of cold  pep/pineapple and a cheese pizza left and when asked if more was coming out the guy said he could make what I wanted but it would take about 15 minutes. The point of eating at a buffet is to have food ready to eat. I will continue to order take out but won't be back for the buffet.</Review>

The point of eating at a buffet is to have food ready to eat. I will continue to order take out but won't be back for the buffet.</Text>

Yesterday, I visted this particular location.  I had not been here in about 4 years, so I had lower expectations as quality usually drops.   However, I was ultimately surprised to find the quality of a higher tier.   I did find it a little odd to have Tapatio at a pizza joint, but I was OK with it.  The salad bar was stocked with many different dressings and sauces, but I only picked out ranch for my party's pizza.   I know for sure, that next time, I will try tue thousand island and honey mustard.   I also found the specials and free magnets enjoyable.  However, we should not forget about the main thing; the pizza!   The pizza was quite phenomenal, as it always is at Round Table Pizza locations.   While it was quite greasy and was somewhat problematic when putting parmesan cheese on it, it was still exceptional, perhaps the best of anuly chain restaurant, abd better than many smaller restaurants.  The drinks were also enjoyable.   In the end, Round Table Pizza definitely deserved its perfect score.< /review>

They are by FAR the BEST pizza around.  We've been coming to various Round Tables for over 30 years, and no other pizza place (and we've tried many others) can compare.  It may cost a couple dollars more than the cheap-o cardboard-tasting pizzas, but their ingredients can't be beat!!<//Review>

<text>I used to really enjoy Round Table. Unfortunately they have cut and cut and cut and now they are on par or maybe even below Domino's or Pizza Hut. They used to be good quality but now it't just a depressing boring meal that you regret.< /text>< pictures>

<userid>104903417284772014846<//userid><Text>I used to love ordering pizza from Round Table. It was such a treat. It costs way more than other places but the quality is also much better. Which is why it is disappointing in recent times that they have become very stingy with their ingredients. It just doesn't taste the same without the toppings. My recent order was for a large pizza with 3 toppings & 12 boneless wings with delivery & tip cost almost $50. What I received was the pizza with each slice containing 1 pepperoni, 1 piece of ham & a couple pineapple. The wings came with 1 piece of pathetic looking celery.  They get 2 stars instead of 1 star because when I called to speak to the manager to basically ask if they were being stingy now because they are going out of business he quickly had a driver re-deliver a small pizza with the appropriate amount of topping & another 6 wings with 2 pieces of pathetic looking celery. I told him that if that were my restaurant producing food that looked like what I received that I would be embarrassed. It definitely is not Round Table quality anymore. Very sad especially because I love Round Table & prefer them over Papa John's, Pizza Hut & Domino's.  I have a photo of my pathetic slice of pizza that I will have to try to post. I'm just not sure how. My message to management would be that in an effort to save a few cents on toppings you will lose customers thereby losing much more in the long run. Hope it's worth it.</Text>< Rate>

Lunch buffet is a good deal. Round table offers decent food but it seems to be one of the pricier places for pizza given all the other pizza joints/chains around.< /text>

<review>Great food during happy hour, service was good and drinks were even better.  Will definitely be returning with friends and family.   Fun atmosphere for kids.  They have a cool tablet menu ordering system that offers games for kids to play as parents enjoy conversation!<//review>< pics>

My wife and I enjoy the food here but the service is really something that we would like to be better. Atmosphere is great and is usually crowded at night but less so during the day. The bar section is also wide and of good quality.<//review>

<Text>Came here for brunch a few weeks ago.  Got the veggie sandwich and bf got the Benedict.  Fresh, clean, light and easy on the stomach and wallet.  If I lived more than 10 miles away I wouldn't make the drive but if I lived in the area, it'd def be one of my staple brunch spots.  Super nice staff too.</Text>< Date>

The hostess was rude. We got pretzels and cheese for an appetizer that was awesome. Everything else was horrible. The kids pizza was doughy, the clam chowder was spicy and didn't taste like clam chowder. My chicken club was dry. Our waiter was super nice but I would not return.</text>

The waiter was great. Food was awesome. Beware of the kiosk.. tip amounts are elevated and inaccurate. It read that $20 was 20% of 65$. The manager said she was going to speak to corporate about the issue but until that is fixed, beware.<//Review>

Came late around 930pm ordered a turkey burger with cheese. Forgot the cheese, no big deal burger was still good, very little fries also not a big deal. My bf ordered salmon was dry and so so small veggies were cold. Serve wasnt the most personable but not rude. Service seemed like no one really cared. Overall probably wont be back, it use to be better about a year ago.</review>

If I can give a lower value star I would! I swear today is Memorial Day!? And to top it off my its my birthday! What a joke it must be? Because my service was hella horrible!
I felt so low as a veteran (servicewomen) and a person. No one tried to talk to me about what was going on not even the management!
I'm more than pissed off but hey I realize you can't encourage people to be hospitable or have some kind of humility...
I should have never came out the house!<//Review>

Ribs and cocktails. Do I need to say more? Service was excellent. Wait was no more than ten minutes and the server kept the glasses full and the food was hot.< /Review>

< review>
Got Ripped off.  Isidro (a self-proclaimed bartender for 10yrs) poured me what he called "double shots" of whisky like I ordered, but they were totally single shots.
$17 for two mouth-fulls of cheap booze by an employee unwilling to even make any kind of attempt to remedy my situation, instead he just shrugged.
I should've known, this isn't a bar.
Why'd I even come here?
I won't anymore, and you shouldn't either.</review>

<rating>2< /rating><Review>2 stars only because the food saved their rating. Went with my girlfriend at 1 o clock on a Wednesday so it wasnt too busy. We were seated immediately but ended up waiting 20 minutes just to be asked what we wanted to drink. The waitress then took so long to bring us our drink that a hostess came by with our beverages apologizing on her behalf. 30 minutes later our food finally arrives.... but wait there's more. The waitress did not enter my order correctly so i was stuck with a good looking (but not what i wanted) order. The waitress never checked in with us throughout the entire meal, the manager was the only one who came and when we explained our experience to her she comped all of our food and apologized.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80dcd50502a5d3bd:0x8ab83ffb5f866900</GmapID></record>

The service is absolutely terrible. We sat at the bar and waited and waited and waited for a long time. The servers kept ignoring us. When we finally were able to put in our order we were told there are multiple restrictions on the specials and happy hour items. Sooooo f* complicated, only certain ones are half off, but not other ones. The pick 2 for $10 is only for lunch and only very few choices.

I took my wife and kids  to this location for the first time  last weekend, and the staff was very friendly
But our waitress has to work on her skills...
I had never been to a restaurant where I had to ask the waitress to please bring napkins and utensils ... Had to eat my appetizer without utensils and without napkins..  when she finally comes to bring the utensils and napkins she tries to take the appetizer plate  that I was still working on without asking... My crispy shrimp was a little soggy
and when she  give me the check she blame everything on the place I was sitting
(I DID NOT ASK TO SIT THERE)..  saying  "sorry to rush you but you guys are all the way back here to the last table." Really??
Not saying the place is bad but next time I just rather pay my $100 somewhere else... we just had a bad experience !!!</text>

We haven't been here in years... and now I remember why. Walked in on a Thurs night at about 7 pm. There were two parties waiting and no host at the booth. Waited about 5 mins for someone to show up.  He stated a 5 min wait.  We were seated in that amount of time, but I thought it was odd that there was a wait when the restaurant was mostly empty. The host took our drink order for some reason but not a big deal. Waiter took about 15 min to arrive. We ordered the unlimited apps and a kids meal. The order took forever to arrive.  Which is weird as they are basically frozen and refried foods.  We ordered a second round immediately since they took so long the first time.  Also took forever and was incorrect upon delivery. Third round ordered upon delivery of 2nd.  About 20 min later my husband put in a dessert order since we still hadn't gotten round 3. About 5 min later the dessert arrives before round 3 by about a minute. Very odd. Food was nothing to write home about. "Unlimited" apps took almost 1 hr to get 3 rounds.  Just poor all the way around.  Not an enjoyable meal. I don't  believe the server was at fault. There is obviously a kitchen problem. We will not be returning.<//Text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Text>Christina is always very polite willing to help. I didn’t have to leave work early to go to my unit, she’s more than happy to work with you about any question or concern. I’ve been with this facility for close to 8 years now and that is why. No problems at all from the customer and it is a very clean well kept establishment! There’s a reason why it’s always full, if a spot opens up get it as quick as you can!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>I love when I go to a place with expectation and my expectations are met!! I went to extra space storage to see if I can get a unit and what I was expecting wasn’t available but Yohana came up with a solution and made sure I was taken care of. She was polite and she went above just welcoming me. Thank you for taking care of my needs. YOU ROCK!! ✨<//review>< Rate>

I have had my unit for over 2 years.  The prices continue to go up.  They have added an additional unit near the only entrance to the indoor storage unit closest to Norwalk to try and squeeze out more money and you can hardly get the cart through the door and around the new unit.  I am paying for an indoor storage unit in part for climate control and they appear to no longer run the climate control as it was hotter inside than outside.  They changed the entrance code system and did not even let me know that they gave me a new code.

Worst of all is that I just discovered my unit was broken into and management seemed to hardly care.  They obviously knew it had been broken into as they had repaired the chicken wire that was cut away that is all that is in place to protect the unit from the top.  They said to call the police to file a report and then try and sort out what is missing and damaged.  They indicated that multiple units were broken into assuming this was the same time as the others.  The very clear lack of concern and even the simplest of compassion after just discovering this violation just added salt to a very fresh wound.

Bottom line - they are cutting back services, increasing prices, poor security, and general lack of caring.  One star is a bit too much for this place.<//review>

Extra space storage on Wardlow.so clean I mean like military grade .. what really impressed me was the employees, Ana was so patient and understanding (computers are not yet michael bird friendly)yes Ana computed every thing that I was supposed  to do and Christine handled the other end and "viola" lock and keys ..pretty as you please. Ana offered to help this ol' man, but with numerous smooth rollin' carts and access so well planned  it was a cinch! Being a hoarder of all things 'treasure' I am very fortunate to have such a great place to store and secure with wonderful people to oversee it all</text>

<Text>Can I give negative stars? I have been here for 14 years. This is the 3rd company to take over and by far the worst. They increase the rent 2 - 3 times a year, they've crammed a new storage unit into any and every nook and cranny. They've taken out the bathrooms and will not allow you into the office any more. We've been broken into, and then they tried to raise the rent AGAIN. When I objected, they kicked us out. The office workers here are not friendly at all. Security is a joke. Please do not rent here, go anywhere else.</Text>< Response>

<Review>Called from Fresno, Christina helped me out with getting a unit. Very professional, directed me, provided me with all the options and walked me through the process.

I would like to thank her for the experience.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<text>I went to talk to Christina (Manager) about possibly renting a parking space, she told me that they were all rented unfortunately but she could let me know when one becomes available. She could’ve left it at that but then she started to look at other options once I told her I needed something soon and she was able to work out something for me.

Christina was great and didn’t give up until she found a solution that would fit my needs, great customer service!! I would recommend her location to anyone.< /text>< userid>

Miss Diana the Store Manager displayed the highest level of professionalism in exceeding my storage space needs.  She explained several options that fit my budget then she gave me a tour of the facility and three storage units,  in doing so it made my choices for storage space very easy to choose from.

Miss Diana's smile, attitude, pleasant personality, and her interaction with me during the entire storage process truly displayed her  exceptional customer service skills.

Miss Diana is an amazing manager and she is truly a great asset to the Extra Space establishment.</Review>

Dan greeted me at the front counter and escorted me to the storage unit I was interested in. Dan was extremely polite and professional. He answered all questions and concerns for me promptly. He walked it from where I would unload any vehicle to my actual storage unit, with shortest path during our tour.

We went through contract paperweight and details thoroughly.

Christina was very friendly and helpful. Showed me three separate units and helped me to pick the best one to suit my needs, as well as ensuring I was satisfied with everything. She also gave me the best rates I could find compared to other storage places in the area. 5/5 for Extra Storage.<//Text>

< Review>
I found myself suddenly facing a big move out of a place I had lived at for twenty years and I knew I would need a storage unit. I've accompanied friends over the years to various different storage places but the best by far is Self Storage Units off Wardlow Road in Long Beach. I went on line and reserved a unit and the next day when I went to the office I met Brian who was very helpful and showed me the facility. It is very clean, great access to units and I ended up getting a bigger unit than the one I reserved. I was still given the on-line discount and Brian explained everything in detail. The first step to a big move- and a great choice.< /Review>

The customer service was amazing! Brian was such a huge help and made my first storage unit buying experience a breeze! He explained everything so we'll and I really feel like he had my best interests in mind when offering me upgrades or merchandise (like the mattress bag I completely forgot I needed). Excited to continue to do business here!</Review>

<Review>I checked several storage facilities nearby (I didn’t want to travel far to move stuff) and chose Extra Space. I wanted a facility in a safe neighborhood where I could use it at night, one that accepted packages, climate controlled, clean and a good staff. I met and talked with Christina who gave me a tour, explained the rates and how the facility works. I am leaving the area and needed a facility that would allow me to store items long term while I travel. I also wanted to allow two family members access and Extra Space has a key service for authorized access.

What impressed me was the follow up I received after I tried to stop a moving device from tailgating in on me during non-office hours. I was able to stop them because they’d be trespassing and Extra Space apologized even though it wasn’t their fault. They reviewed the security tapes and said they made a note
of those movers for the future.

The follow up and concern for a customer impressed me and I was expecting the feedback to go to a corporate office. My issues were all resolved by the local staff and I’m happy to recommend them.</Review>< Pictures>

First time using this storage facility Extra Space Storage. I already know my husband and I will trust our item storage needs here. Christina and Dan were very help full and genuinely look like they enjoy their jobs. They were friendly, suggestive and helpful with every question and concerns we had. They use an Electronically contract system which I was not to excited about since it generated a signature for me that I did not do but I understand it’s a computer thing. Overall both of them made our experiences pleasant. Thank You< /review>

My dad rented a unit from Extra Space and it was a great experience overall. The young man that helped us, Pedro, was very polite and had great customer service. He really gave the place a friendly vibe and improved our experience. The unit we rented was very clean and overall the whole complex seemed to be very well kept. Thanks for the great experience, Extra Space!< /review>

Extra Space Storage runs an immaculate, state-of-the-art facility in East Long Beach. Terms are fair, rates are reasonable given the facilities and security, and staff are very efficient and thorough. I recommend this place to everyone!<//Review>

Brian was super helpful and very nice. He helped with showing my new unit asking with making sure the entire process was clear and in my best interest. He wanted to make sure my move in process was easy and secure, he even moved a cart for me so I could move my stuff more easily. I only need the unit for a short time and Brian helped make sure I knew everything to make the prices easiest.< /Text>

<rate>2</rate><review>After going through the lengthy procedure of securing a storage unit, I was obligated by staff to give ExtraSpaceStorage 5 star review on Google. This is 'Conflict of Interest' according to Googles review policy.
The only reason why this place has 5 stars, is because staff instruct customers to open their Google Maps app, type in "ExtraSpaceStorage" and then click 5 stars. I was explicitly told by staff to give ExtraSpaceStorage 5 star review, as part of the procedure of securing a storage unit.
When I pulled my phone out and open google maps like I was requested, staff literally started poking my phone to do the review for me, no joke.
I hope Google takes action against this illegally inflated review. I also hope ExtraSpaceStorage acknowledges this breach of integrity, and discontinues the mandatory rate-us-5-stars policy.
Brian, the manager, is very helpful and handled my concern professionally. Tho, I doubt ExtraSpaceStorage will acknowledge their policy of obligating clients to submit 5-star review.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>
