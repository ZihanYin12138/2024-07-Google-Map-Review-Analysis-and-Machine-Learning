<Rating>1</Rating><review>This is by far the worst customer service experience I’ve ever had. I’ve been to 3 different enterprise locations since 2019 in California and I’ve never been turned away completely and been met with such rude behavior especially from the manager. We did not opt to get insurance and I’ve done that 2 out of the 3 times I’ve rented from enterprise. That is absolutely an option. But the man was trying to lecture me on buying their insurance and I let him know that I opted not to get it and that’s all that should matter. I felt profiled especially by the manager based on how hostile he was towards me and my significant other making us seem as though we were a “type” of customer that would deck their cars and then not pay and they’d have to eat the cost. They ended up turning us away all together and that’s just never happened to me. Terrible experience, a waste of our time , and just very disappointing. And we weren’t rude at all, we patiently waited outside for service to be met with this.... just the worst experience I’ve had in a while and a complete waste of our time.< /review>< Pictures>

Christian went well above any other car rental person I have worked with. He stayed way past to accommodate us and went through the whole car and still did the same on the return.

Horrible service from the manager Manny, We ordered our vehicle for 1 extra day and they doubled the price on us.  They are changing me 2 days in a 24 hour period,  this is crazy.  I am a prime customer with you guys and now I will never rent from Enterprise again and it sucks because I usually get a really good deal.  How do you support bad employees like this?  I hope a district manager or higher can contact me regarding this issue.</Text>

Your Manager at 2911 Brundage Lane Bakersfield CA 93304
is an a****le. I made reservation ahead for a whole week rental
and she had me walk a mile and a half to your office from the service shop where I drop my car off for repairs. Just to tell me that I can not rent
a car because I have no major credit card. I was able to rent from Enterprise twice last March, 2020. One in North Hollywood and another in Van Nuys
When I had my car repaired. I will never rent from Enterprise Again from
now on.<//Review>

Terrible experience. Tree fell on my car so I had to get my car fixed. When I went to get the rental, they only had 2 options my insurance would pay for so I decided to upgrade. I was told it would be $8 per day for the upgrade which I agreed to. Returned the car after 20 days, and was charged way more than would it should've been. I call to find out what's going on, it took 20 minutes for someone to pick up. After being put on hold 3 more times, they say I had to pay for 21 days because of they way they count their days, and they charged me tax on the whole amount,  not just the $8/day. Not to mention the car was filthy inside and smelled horrible. Overall, horrible experience. Having your car ruined in the first place is bad enough, you hope at least the rental process is a bit better. Very disappointing.

FYI, "John" told me to contact them so he can "help".. don't be fooled. They didn't do a thing. They asked me what happened. I told them. Then never got a response.< /review>

< Review>
incredibly nice staff but their cars are filthy. My car had food stains and dirt and dust in and around the window controls. The carpet looked freshly vacuumed but all of the controls had either food stains or other unknown junk all over them. I had to clean it our because quite frankly it was nauseating.
Who ever is maintaining these cars needs to be fired. My car has 4 different tires on it and the underbody cladding that is removed to do oil changes is dragging. Someone forgot to put the support screws back in.
Overall ok but if you are going to rent a car bring a cloth to wipe it down.<//Review>

I am a long time corporate Enterprise customer since 2002.  This time around, I had to use Enterprise for my personal use.  Normally, I usually get excellent service from the staff, which was still the case.  However, I upgraded my car out of pocket, only to receive a dirty car (both inside and out).  Usually, a staff member asks me to wait 5 minutes so they can run it through the car wash.  I actually had it washed at my local carwash spent out of pocket.  I let the agent know upon returning the car at another Enterprise location as well.  Normally I would rate Enterprise 5 stars, however, today was 'average'...</review>

<review>Had a great experience with Enterprise Rent-A-Car. My car was in the shop for some repairs so my insurance company used Enterprise for my rental car service. The guys here were very helpful and were pretty quick with getting my rental prepared. They picked me up from the car shop, brought me to their location, took my information & rental confirmation info, showed me my rental car, we did a walk around car inspection, they explained to me details on the agreement-insurance-etc., and I was on my way. The guys at the location was very professional and helpful. I've dealt with other rental companies in the past and it can be very frustrating when you have to deal with unprofessional-ism, unfriendly people, and just overall people who act like they don't want to do their job. A job that they applied for and got accepted and hired to do.

Again I had a great experience here at Enterprise Rent-A-Car the Sherman Way location and I appreciate you guys help. Thank You!</review>< pics>

I want to take the employees at this enterprise  home and cook them dinner because when I'm renting a car they treat me like family too. Knowledgeable and friendly, I only rent from this place! Thanks!</review>

<Text>I called the night before my reservation to make sure I could get a pick up in the morning, they said that was no problem so I decided to keep my reservation with them although there was another location closer to me, mainly because they had a slightly cheaper car, but also, they said they could pick me up. I called again the next morning, had to call 5 times before anyone picked up and they said they couldn't pick me up all, even though they had said something completely different the night before.

I ended up taking a taxi there, and had to wait a while to get my car cause they were too busy. I finally got the car and it was filthy inside, seats were all stained and the entire dashboard and steering wheel were covered in some white substance.

I ended up dropping the car off at the Van Nuys location cause I didn't want to have to deal with the customer service at NoHo again. The Van Nuys people were great and offered me a ride home as soon as I got there. Even though I got a better deal at the NoHo location, I will only be renting from Van Nuys from now on.<//Text></record>

Unfair rip offs trying to bill my insurance for their previous damage. I rented a car from enterprise on Sherman Way in North Hollywood, through AAA. It was a little white car and they asked me to look for golf ball size dings. I didn't see any and the next day the battery died on the car and I returned it to the enterprise on Van Nuys Blvd., got a different car, but they spotted some inch and a half-long indentation of about a quarter inch at most, which I had overlooked because in the afternoon shadows, it was unable to be seen. Anyway it was definitely not a golf ball sized ding.
Then a week later I get a letter saying they are billing my insurance for the damage which I never did. They are trying to use my insurance to get their car fixed for something I never did.
Watch out! I would never do business with this bunch of losers again!</review>

<Review>First off I must say that customer service was excellent. As far as the car went, well.... They rented me a ford focus that had expired plates. I was pulled over in Van Nuys with my wife and newborn baby in the car. Fortunately, the officer seen it was a rental and told me to get the tag updated and didn't give me a ticket. The car's oil change light came on and the rear drivers side tire had a slow leak, causing me to use the doughnut. So, I could tell that the car itself wasn't very well maintained. Yet, when I had to return the vehicle the customer service representative was very accommodating and gave me an extra 5% refund on top of my deposit.</Review>< Pics>

I put a strip of phosphorescent tape on the space at the side of my wireless charger (which I use all the time and love!)

Products that exceed expectations. Service that exceeds expectations. Everything about this brand and company exceeds expectations. "Self-publishing" allows small combines to craft an image far from reality. Nomad crafts a beautiful image... then delivers even more. I am thoroughly impressed... they've earned a loyal customer and I will eagerly spread the word.</review>

<Review>I have one of there products and I am really happy end to end service.

I had a little issue and they resolved it with a smile. what was amazing is they  made me feel important and that I was a high valued client and they wanted to make me happy no matter what.

Superior product !
Excellent service !
I’d they had an IPO I would invest !< /Review>< username>

< Review>
I’ve been using Nomad products for years now, since the iPhone 7. I highly recommend their leather products. Their service and responsiveness is really top notch. I’m really glad that they stand by the quality of their products that even when I got one with a defect, they readily replaced it when I expressed my dissatisfaction. Will definitely keep on buying from them again. Buy with confidence!</Review>

<review>USPS lost my package during delivery, but NOMAD customer service was quick to respond (shout-out to Chloe) and sent a replacement right away with priority shipping. I have shopped with them in the past and I can attest that to the quality of their products. I don't write reviews often, so rest assure that if you are reading this, you are dealing with an excellent company with great product line and even better customer service.

I have purchased multiple phone cases, watch straps, and a wallet from Nomad over the years. Their products are top notch, and the two times I had an issue where something broke, they mailed me a replacement and made it so easy. They're an excellent company and I'll be a loyal customer for life!</Review>

<review>Bought two Base Stations (Apple Watch Editions) for my parents for Christmas. Amazing quality, they both love them. Had an issue with one base station that required replacement, and the Facebook support chat was so attentive and quick to fix any issues I had. Loved my product and customer support experience, will absolutely be buying more products for myself in the future!<//review>< pictures>

<Review>Where do I even start!

This company and  their products are truly amazing and very unique! Less than 2 hours after placing my order I received a notification letting me know my Order has shipped. Not even amazon has shipping that fast!!  When my Product arrived the first thing that caught my eye was the box, and the level of design and detail put into every square inch, it’s as if your opening a box to a Rolex but for a wallet.

Wrapped neatly inside is a leather pouch that holds the wallet , once again just another step above most to showcase their incredible product. I ordered the slim wallet with the tile tracking chip. When you open your wallet their is a conveniently placed tab that says “ press here to activate your tile” and you hear the sound of it turning on.

The wallet I ordered was made very well and after retiring my previous wallet of 13 years I wasn’t just going to settle for any wallet. Budget wasn’t the issue it was finding a quality item that reflected quality character and style and would be with me to keep my finances safe and secure in every turn and bend in the road to come. Nomad is all that and then some.

The cherry on top was a little sealed envelope that said “ thanks for choosing Nomad” also inside was a few stickers and a note saying we would love to see where you put these. How many wallet company’s give out stickers!?!? That’s freaking awesome everyone loves stickers!

All in all this company their customer service and their strong will to reduce and manage environmental waste is truly on another level. I will continue to order many products from these guys for years to come and can’t recommend them enough to friends family or even any viewer who is reading this review! If you feel tempted to make an order as Nike says “JUST DO IT!”<//Review>< Pictures>

I bought a watch strap for my Apple watch from Nomad and unfortunately it broke just a few weeks after. However, Nomad showed impeccable customer service and the staff was really helpful. A new strap is on the way and covered by their warranty.</text>

I ordered a phone case and Nomad shipped the wrong model.  The order is clearly stated and there should not have been any confusion.  I went on line and applied for a return / refund.  The automated system let me know I would be refunded for the product but not the shipping and handling.   I have sent an email to their support with no reply.  I called and got a machine.  Maps says they are temporarily closed.  Hmmm!

A few days later they replied and stated they would refund the shipping and handle.  Today,  I received a credit for only the cover, no shipping and handling as promised. Honesty and integrity has been lost with this company!</Review>

NOMAD is an amazing company! I have ordered multiple items from them and they always arrived in perfect condition with no issue at all since using the items (multiple base stations, watch straps, laptop sleeve, wireless charger for Tesla). During one of our shipments a package was lost and after contacting Fedex and NOMAD all was resolved. NOMAD sent a replacement without any issues or delays (even during the pandemic). They were quick to answer via Facebook and were so professional. I would definitely recommend NOMAD and will be buying more from this AMAZING company!< /review>

<Review>Amazing company! I ordered a base station - hub edition wireless charger and the build quality is amazing!

Sadly, the unit I ordered came with a slight defect that is a high frequency noise whilst wirelessly charging my devices. However, the customer care support team were quick in response and very understanding in my situation. They’re sending a new unit without any extra cost.

Big thanks to the Nomad team for the amazing service and communication. Highly recommend!!!< /Review>< GmapID>

After hiccups with the order process, where I paid extra for express delivery which then wasn't the case, the company, via their customer service, became exemplary. I had Chloë reach out to me and basically immediately refund my shipping cost. This was all painless and remedied the situation on my end. I couldn't be happier when a company has a good product, but more importantly, great customer service. The rugged leather case for my iPhone 12 mini in natural leather is a treat. There's more than enough reviews of the actual product. I am here to celebrate their attention to customer needs.</Text>

I absolutely love the Rugged leather case from Nomad, it feels great. I have had 3 of them. 2 for the iPhone X and one for iPhone 12 Pro Max. I did have to RMA one of them, I sent them the pics of my case where it messed up and the sent another right out. And they have cases that work with Moment lenses too.< /Text>

<Review>Consumers should be wary of this company because they have no phone support option at all, only email which they will reply to once a day if you're lucky. I placed an order through the their website for the Base Station Walnut Hub Edition which is advertised to support all QI wireless charging products. The product however won't charge my iPhone 12 which uses this standard. The warranty period is two years and my product is still under that term as of the claim I filed. They have not offered a refund or replacement device and instead are forcing me to help them troubleshoot their own product. I've followed the steps they have given over 14 days and still haven't resolved the product issues because it is a hardware deficiency that can't be fixed remotely. They mentioned many other customers are having this same issue and still refuse to follow through on their express warranty.</Review><user>108382579809284844446</user><user_name>Virat Parikh< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

I purchased the wireless charging base for tesla model 3 in december 2019. The product does its job well, fits perfectly into the space provided in the machine and allows charging up to two phones, even large ones (I own an iphone 12 pro max ). Perfect assistance, they answer emails very quickly and are very kind. Chloë in particular helped me with a product that I always got on this site
recommended!

After ordering a cable recently I ordered 2 more. Unfortunately, I ordered the wrong cables. I was expecting a big headache with the return. Much to my surprise, within an hour of reporting my issue, Nomad sent a return label for the incorrect order (my fault) and shipped out the replacement cables! It is a pleasure dealing with Nomad - their customer service is second to none. And their products are high quality too!< /review>

Everything feels sturdy, well built and precisely finished when you hold one of their items in hands (a Base Station Apple Watch Edition in my case). And I especially love the leather quality. The next product from Nomad that is on my shopping list is the Active Leather band for Apple Watch which is sure to give my device a nice new look! Totally recommend those guys!

This is my review for the Rugged Folio iPad Pro 11 (2nd gen) case!

"The most luxurious case I will ever own."

From the extremely light and sleek look of the case, to how it fits the iPad 11 like a silk glove - the Rugged Folio has exceeded every single expectation I could have ever dreamed of.  I recommend this case not only for the austere aesthetics, but also for the durability and grip it gives the user.

This is the pinnacle of when form meets functionality, and with a single purchase Nomad has hands-down convinced me to become a life-long customer.

The build quality is so superb, I find myself in disbelief sometimes when my hand rests on this case because I thought craftsmanship of this kind went extinct a long time ago...

Shout-outs to Chloe too what an excellent representative and support for the customer!< /text>

These guys are the best at making high quality craftsmenship!! Not just the leather stuff. The way the leather seamlessly fits into the rubberized high quality meterial... man... just perfection. I currently have the Ipad Pro 12.9 rugged leather case, the Airpods Pro one and these 2 show this attention to detail. I have also the strap for the apple watch, all in brown. I tend to have an all black set up all around my other stuff so my main gear i wanted it in some contrast, and this brown is quite special. And the kevlar usb c cable... the macbooks should come in the box with that. Even the charging is better than an Apple original cable. Keep up the good work guys. The innovation and the seamless design language of the leather, wood and metal fit perfectly with the high quality products we buy. You wouldn’t want to wrap your devices in aliexpress material. Trust me, I’ve been there so many times, and the money you’d spend trying out all those cases that will also break fast, you should invest it in something that makes sense. For Apple at least, Nomad makes perfect sense!<//Text>

I ordered a USB-C cable and a leather clad phone charger, and they’ve absolutely spoiled me with their quality. Every detail from the product to the packaging is both thoughtful and elegant. Customer service is excellent, too! Summary - pricey, and worth it.<//review>< user>

<review>After jumping on the Black Friday sale and ordering myself the Black Leather iPhone case, I was so impressed with the attention to detail and workmanship I ordered 3 more additional items in a follow up order. Extremely high quality goods with an amazing aesthetic and design. Thoroughly impressed as a career marketing professional!</review>< Pics>

<Review>Got the Active Rugged Case for iPhone 11 pro max and to say the least, the case is amazing. The fit and finish of the case and the leather used on it are really amazing and it repels water just as Nomad advertises it. You cannot go wrong with Nomad cases!</Review></record>

I have everything from a phone and air pods case to the wireless charging stations. Every product I have from Nomad has become a staple in my life. I also haven’t had to even consider buying a new phone charging cable, the Kevlar cables are basically indestructible. Anyways, Nomad fits my needs for everyday ease and also satisfies my aesthetic goals. 👌< /Text>

Picked up the Active Rugged Case for iPhone 11 Pro - best case I’ve ever owned! Almost a 1/4” narrower across than my Otterbox Symmetry case! Do not hesitate to order it sight-unseen if it’s not stocked locally for you - you will never regret it ;D< /Text>

Great company making top notch products. I've been using Universal Cable-1.5M for two years now with great satisfaction. Having the option of carrying only one cable capable for charging different type of devices is perfect. Anyone who travels or have devices with different type of charges will appreciate those type of cables. During the use of the product I've experienced the issue with one of the charging tips but upon submitting the warranty claim and prompt response from the customer service  I received the replacement with no additional charges. Someone can question the cost of the products but having a high quality item and great customer service like Nomad is providing can, in my honest opinion, justify any cost.</review>

<text>Reason why I’m leaving this is because like a Consumer that I am. I have used several different leather brands and I’ll say nomad products are a hit or miss. When I did my first order of a brown case iPhone X Max, and a brown leather band for the Apple Watch everything was great until the mailing part came into play.  Took way longer than I anticipated, and it was promised thus adding to the frustration customer services with Chloe took days to get a response.

But I’m a person that gives second chances.. and when I purchased the black band, and case for my Apple products they were used, and in poor condition. I immediately contact customer service that delayed over a week to respond back to my inquiry. By then I didn’t care of getting an replacement product from them, and stated to them they lost a customer.

Purchase to your discretion.. and if you do good luck remember it’s a hit or miss! Customer services is truly horrible.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<text>I received a defective product, I informed the company who provided me with a return shipping label after some push back. I get the defective product shipped back. From the very beginning I told the company I wanted a brand new replacement. They do the complete opposite and issue me a refund, I contact the company again and get a respond from an employee where she said they would send a replacement. They start a warranty claim and per their email item will ship out in 1-2 days. this was last week, I have been emailing them, calling (unable to leave a message due to mailbox being full) , instagram message and twitter message and I can not get a response to where my replacement product is.. its ridiclous</text>< pics>

This company offers beautiful products at reasonable prices with and great service. I own one of their leather AirPods cases, which was very reasonably priced and actually looks better and better with age. I've received multiple compliments on it.

I also own a Nomad portable charger, which is brilliantly designed and works flawlessly. Never go anywhere without it.

Now that I have the iPhone 11, my first move was to order a leather Nomad case to match my AirPods case. Can't wait to get it!</review>

Nomad offers a wide variety of amazing tech accessories for all smart devices. I first found Nomad 4+ years ago when searching for a leather Apple Watch Strap. Found their very first strap, and have been hooked since.

Customer service has been exceptional with Chloë, their super helpful customer happiness team member. Nomad sticks by their products and offers support whenever I have any issues on the rare occasions.

Hoping to see a Nomad backpack soon to complete the EDC!</review>

<text>I'm pretty disappointed. I ordered the Base Station Apple Watch Edition months ago with it supposed to be shipping at the end of June. The backorder changed to the end of July and then the End of August. Finally I got the product at the end of September. I quickly open it up and set it up to use it, and it doesn't work.

I e-mailed support and after several days they replied asking me if the status lights turn on when it's plugged in (they do not). So after several more days they offered to send me a replacement A/C Adapter. (Why not just send me an entirely new unit vs. shipping me a part and hoping it works?) A few more days go by and I receive a notice that they tracking information for my replacement Adapter. It's been a week now and that adapter hasn't been picked up by Fedex yet.</text>< Resp>

< Review>
NOMAD is a great company. their products strive to achieve greatness and most of them succeed. i’ve had some bad experience with their old Carbon Cases which they don’t sell anymore, but their cables, batteries, Watch straps, and power products are all top of the line, stickers are cool too. their customer service is amazing, i’ve been helped by Chloë numerous times. their products aren’t the cheapest, but the quality is well worth it. if you’re looking for good accessories that aren’t made by Apple, NOMAD is the place to go.</Review>

Don't buy the Apple Watch Base Station.

That said, the quality of the product and the packaging in second-to-none.  The braided power cord is adds to the reassurance that this is a well-built product.  That said, I spend waaaay too much time searching for a coil.  With my watch, AirPods and phone, I truly needed every coil and I was embarrased, rather than proud of how easy it was to charge my devices.  It was like looking for a needle in a haystack--blindfolded.

After a couple weeks, I gave up and I've paid for return shipping from Canada and have already taken delivery of a SliceJuice Pro.  It doesn't feel as solid as Nomad's Base Station, but it's much easier to line things up with its six coils and it's cheaper.  I have yet to see whether I will be getting a refund on my return.

Sorry, Nomad--I really wanted it to work but it's not me; it's you.

Add a few more coils and I'll be glad to come back.<//Text>

I refinanced a couple months ago with Veterans National Mortgage to see if we could get out interest rate down and we did! The process was swift and whenever there was an issue they worked hard and always staying in touch, even on off-hours, to make sure the issue was solved. We refinanced during June vacation and the savings we made help pay for our vacation. I recommend them for your refinance.</text>

Thank Bill Madonia you are the best loan officer I’ve ever dealt with. I have applied for home loans for 4 times in my young life 😉. By far the loan you secured for me on my house was so fast and efficient that 4 moths after the fact I’m blown away. You are an asset to all you touch.

Thank You so much</Review>

<Text>I recently closed on my first home purchase, and needless to say it was a complete learning process. Fortunately, I worked with Daniel Chaney. There’s nobody else I would want to have worked with more. Anytime I called him, I was 110% confident that he would answer the phone, or immediately respond to my messages. He was extremely transparent, knowledgeable, and always went the extra mile. He made recommendations when appropriate and always had my best interest in mind. He’s also a down right nice guy.  As a broker, he also ensured I was given access to the lowest rates around.

It’s a shame so many veterans out there get ‘had’ by the bigger mortgage brands out there, even though their rates are higher costing tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars more (over 30 years). My suggestion would be to go with the lowest rate and more personalized service. At the end of the day, you won’t care which bank you write your check to.

I’m very grateful to have worked with Daniel and look forward to working with him / Veterans National again in the future.</Text>< username>

Me: Successfully bought a house at 2.25%/30yrs!  You: Use a broker!  Bill Madonia: The Best Broker Ever! Denver Area: Savage demand, write a letter to sellers to distinguish your offer!

Closing costs: ONLY $3k out of pocket! (Giant house, appraisal overage covered the other $7k & optional points) VA Funding Fee is applied outside of appraisal to loan value.

Entire experience: Unreal!!

Buying my first home was a learning process. Since I couldn't do any of this during the day, most of my questions came up during the evenings. He Always answered or got back to me within the hour! This was especially above and beyond near closing.

From the very beginning he was honest that VA loan lenders struggle to close within 30 days. I closed one day late, which was no fault of his. He advocated for me and helped get paperwork to the lenders as fast as possible.

After closing, the only thing my fiancée and I heard from friends, family, and our waiter after congratulating us was how hard it is to get a house right now. Lots of stories of friends getting beat by higher offers, cash, or busting closing dates by enough that sellers backed out and went with back up cash offers.

(FYI: Unmarried people can't be on VA loan without down payment, but I, solely, got approved for plenty over the price (Engineer))<//review>

<user_name>Cynthia Luna<//user_name><Text>9.5% (2018) to 4.25%, and then 3.75% VA (2019) refinance loans padded with high fees with Mr. Cooper. They offered me 3.25% in December, 2019. This time I shopped around until I had eight loan estimates. Each loan officer encouraged me to lock the loan before rates increased. I felt thoroughly confused.

The VA newsletter wrote about VettedVA. So, I joined the group to ask for guidance. I posted screenshots of page two of the loan estimates. Members of the group evaluated them. They offered advice and made suggestions. Chris Griffith told me about Dave Holland, Veterans National Mortgage, in California.

My Superhero, Dave Holland secured the best refinance loan ever at a 2.75%/30yr. Fixed Rate with United Wholesale Mortgage. He advised me on my income property and mortgage management. Best of all, he was readily available whenever I called or emailed his office. I save $128/month on the monthly payment now. It took him about two weeks to fund the new mortgage.

I set up bimonthly mortgage payments with the money left in my bank account because I skipped the first payment.

I am grateful for this excellent experience and fantastic outcome.

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>I worked with Daniel Chaney and he was responsive throughout the entire process.  He worked very hard and went the extra mile to get me the best deal possible.  Since Daniel is a mortgage broker, he has access to hundreds of wholesales rates that are much better than the rates an individual can get at a retail bank.  If you are looking for a new loan or refinance, I suggest you speak with Daniel today!<//Review>< pictures>

Amazing first time experience.  They provide second to none service and truly educate their clients on the home buying process. I especially like how passionate they are in getting are armed services members into homes. The best VA loan officers I’ve ever seen. If you want the best, you need to call Dave.</text>

<Review>If you are considering of buying a house or refinancing your home, and want the best possible rate, all you have to do is get a TRUSTED and Knowledgeable Loan Officer. Do your research. We did ours. Prayed and it was answered! We found him through a popular lending referral site. Read reviews and we knew  right away. Dave Holland is THE guy! I don’t get anything from recommending him. I just want others to have same stress-free home buying/refi experience as we did. If I may add, English is not my primary language, but with Dave, we were able to understand the process and the papers we were signing. He did not only help us but he also educated us about the home buying process. He was able to get us the best rate and now we own a piece of America! We are so happy with the result of his hard work that we want to share it with others in hopes that this will also make someone/ other family happy specially in the military community. FYI, 2 of my friends worked with him, too and bought their houses (after I recommended him of course😉). And got the same experience. Now working on third. They are as happy as we were. So give him a chance and you won’t regret it!</Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1560880499455, 'text': 'You guys are awesome! Thank you :-)'}</resp>< gmapID>

I being a disabled veteran and buying a home was a daunting ordeal. First off,  Dave Holland went above and beyond to help me and family get a home and absolutely went out of his way and fought for us get our dream home.

From start to finish he was there for me and my family and I can’t thank him enough for everything he has done. Even after getting the hone he is still checking up on us and continue to assist me and the family.</Text>

Dave has helped me with my loans a few times. He makes it soooooo easy. He will ask for the information he needs, then he makes it all happen without any stress or worry for me. I’ve used other lenders in the past. Only Veterans National Mortgage for all my loan needs now!</text>

<Text>Nice stop for boba while shopping at the Livermore Outlets.  The line can get very long, but moves very quickly in my experience.  I ordered the Taro Milk Tea with pearls on my last visit.  It was really refreshing on a hot day.  The drink was almost too sweet for me, but it was still delicious.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Gmap_id>0x808fe8e8285a6b7f:0x7f60d1c2027b56ea</Gmap_id>< user_name>

Got the Matcha Milk tea..it's not sweet. And not much boba pearls Only one worker when I was there so there was a bit of a wait. The rest of my family enjoyed their drinks. Varying from milk tea to juices and smoothies. Not the worst but I wouldn't come back for the matcha milk tea personally.< /Text>

I was watching the person who was making the so called taro milk tea and all he did was put powder, extra water to fill up the cup then he put a drop of milk and a huge dose of tea. I also asked for some grass jelly and i got one small piece for 50 cents. Compared to all the other tea places I have gone this is by far the worst. If you want real milk tea go to teaspoon of bollinger and you will never come to tea heart again.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<UserId.>105072561409307406840</UserId.><review>If they had good milk tea then I would ignore their awful service. But the classic milk tea taste quite bland as sh*t and pretty watery, even worse than the instant milk tea sold in the supermarket. The cashier tried very hard to ignore her customers and talked in a very low voice quickly and impatiently. I've seen she showed annoying face to 3 asian customers, even though herself is asian. Anyway, this is an unbelievable experience I've ever had in the US. Good luck to you guys!<//review>< Rating>

Favorite place to get boba in the outlets. My friends and I got the house milk tea w/boba, winter melon creama and mango fruit w/mango jelly. The boba was soooo good, sweet and chewy.

The line can be a little long sometimes but staff does a good job of keeping things moving.</Text>

Area is filled with many stores for shopping for all needs. Although there are a lot of gang members as well as homeless and addicts. If your from this neighborhood you should be ok otherwise stay on your P's and Q's. Oh and by the way GoodWill is no longer in this center it's down the street more.</text>

Walmart and Costco are the major big stores there. I go to this Wallmart because it is one of the larger stores, and it is very well stocked. Unlike the smaller Walmart close to me, which, is out of inventory on many items. McDonalds inside, however, parking is a problem because this location is a very busy Hotspot. Costco has a Great food court, with big, large, combination pizzas for $9.99. I phone in order, and ready in 25-30 minutes. I'm guessing they are about 18 inches. Best Pizza deal Anywhere.!!!! Costco gas, Petco, Chase, Carl's Jr., all in the huge parking area.😽😁😇< /Text>

(Translated by Google) In this square I went to the candy store and it is very worth it, they have many sweets from Mexico and in addition to other things also from Mexico, the square is very quiet although I think the parking lot is not that big you always find a place available

(Original)
En esta plaza yo fui a la dulceria y vale mucho  la pena, tienen muchisimos dulces de mexico y ademas de otras cosas tambien de mexico, la plaza esta muy tranquila aunque creo que el estacionamiento no esta tan grande siempre encuentras lugar disponible<//Text>

< Review>
I love to go to 11:30 mass. The choir is the best, they make you want to sing to the music.  They have the voices of angels. Having a drum to accompany the piano is perfect.
I think they have a new committee to decorate the church for the holidays. They are doing a great job. It's a joy to go to mass.< /Review>

<Review>Recently this church has transformed the inside to a beautiful CATHOLIC CHURCH. I say this cause theres some catholic churches that look stale inside like protestants churches. St. Catherine's makes me feel connected to the 2000 years of our catholic tradition.<//Review><rating>5<//rating>< user>

< Review>
Miss Father Paul. He always made going to Mass an amazing experience. When giving his homily, he would do it in such a way that l felt a connection to God.  Now we seldom go because we (my family and I) don't feel that connection anymore.</Review>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>Can I give no stars?? My aunt is from there and recently died.  She wanted a memorial mass so I called an made arrangements for a certain date in Nov. and was told repeatedly that date was saved for our mass.  I was asked to have my brother call for other info they needed.  When he called, they told him they didn't know anything about it !!! Our plane tickets are already bought for the planned ceremony (we're coming from the 'unfriendly' east coast but this 'church' has the unfriendliest people I've ever dealt with).  Anyway, after being told we couldn't have that date, I attempted to get ANYTHING the day before and was told they were busy (a Friday in November????). I'm a practicing Catholic but my brothers have fallen away from the church and this just confirms for them how unwelcoming the (wrong)church can be.  So much for the Popes' call to welcome the lost back.  Hopefully, they'll be a more welcoming Catholic church that will have a mass for her.< /Text>< pics>

Me encanta esta iglesia, es bastante amplia, no tenemos problemas para 3ncontrar lugar para sentarnos, el parking bastante accesible, tal vez debería mejorar el sonido del coro, pero fuera de eso se siente mucha paz y tiene muchos programas para ser católicos activos< /Review>< gmapID>

(Translated by Google) I like to come to thank my Holy Father Jesus Christ. For my life, my health, to thank him for my children, and to ask for all those who have a sick family member and especially so that my Holy Father is the most valuable thing in their lives, that they find in him. True love.
Jesus Christ with me. Who against my NOBODY. Because Christ Jesus lives within me.

(Original)
Me gusta venir para agradecerle a mi Padre Santo Cristo Jesús. Por mi vida, mi salud, agradecerle por mis hijos, y pedir por todos aquellos que tienen un familiar enfermo y sobre todo para que mi Padre Santo sea lo más valioso en sus vidas, que encuentren en el. El verdadero amor.
Cristo Jesús conmigo. Quien contra mi NADIE. Porque Cristo Jesús vive dentro de mi .<//review>

West Hollywood Urgent Care is the place to BE!
I brought my father in just yesterday and the care we received was excellent. I had some questions in regards to his insurance but Barbara assured me that everything was going to be handled on their end. I greatly appreciate their time and helpfulness and will definitely return should the occasion call for it!<//Text>

Quickest most efficient urgent care I've ever been to! I was kindly greeted by the front office as soon as I walked through the door. Once I was all checked in I was put into a room before I even had the chance to have a seat in the lobby!! My vitals were taken as soon as I was put in the room. The doctor who helped me out was extremely nice and gave me the correct treatment that was needed. Now I'm feeling all better thanks to the doctor and staff who helped me out. I would definitely recommend this urgent care to anyone who is looking for a quick doctors visit or COVID TEST!</Review>

Had such a great experience not only my first but also my second visit! From beginning to end of visits watched staff and doctors follow protocols with the pandemic. Staff were all very pleasant. It was a breeze registering. The wait wasn’t long at all (the usual urgent care wait). Thank you North Hollywood Urgent Care! You guys are awesome!</review>

<Text>Went to this facility for my Covid testing.
The staff was efficient, very friendly and patient as I had a lot of questions. The wait wasn’t long before the doctor came in to explain the different types of testing. He was very informative and also very patient. I didn’t feel rushed which was nice.  The facility was also very organized and clean. Great experience. 😁</Text>< pics>

Came here for some blood work my primary doctor sent me to do. Barbara, I believe the office manager took my call since I have a few questions about costs. She was very lovely and gave me a run down of what my insurance was going to cover.
When I came into the office, front office ladies welcomed me with a smile. It felt awesome. They verified my insurance and I was ready to be seen by the doctor.
The doctor at the time of my visit was Dr. Gordon Van Tassell. He is definitely the best doctor I have seen in a long time. He takes his time on you and really cares about your well being. The back office staff made my visit such a lovely visit. I will definitely come back to West Hollywood urgent care if need be.
Oh, they also offer prompt X ray services as well. Highly recommend. Please check them out.< /Review>

<Review>The day I went to the urgent care I thought I was going to wait a long time but as soon I walked in I was greeted at the window and provided my insurance information and they immediately brought me back to an evaluation room to begin my vitals. The medical assistant named valerie was taking my vitals signs she was professional and a big part of making my experience at the urgent care GREAT!(good job Valerie)<//Review>< Rating>

The staff here is amazing. They all took the time to listen and really care but are also fast and efficient. Dr. Barry Buffman is in a class of his own. Knowledgeable, kind and has exceptional bedside manner. I am especially bad at having my blood drawn and Raymond was truly a magician. It just changes your entire experience when there’s a staff this good at an Urgent Care facility. Gigum and Laura were equally great with their efficiency and kindness. I’m lucky I ended up here! Highly recommend this Urgent Care.<//Review>

Probably the worst urgent care facility I've ever visited. I went in for a simple urine test and Dr Van Tassel made me feel extremely uncomfortable with his behavior. He was joking about my condition, touched my shoulder while laughing at his own joke, and refused to stand 6ft away from me. Upon leaving, they refused to bill my insurance company (BCBS) first and insisted that I had to pay out of pocket now. I then had to wait almost a full month for results that should have taken 5 days. When they finally got back to me, they refused to send the prescription to my pharmacy and hung up on me when I persisted. West Hollywood Urgent Care was extremely dismissive of my health and wellbeing, and I urge anyone considering them to choose another option.<//Review>

When I arrived for my Covid  test at Calabasas Urgent Care, I had them verify that there would be no charge for my test through my insurance. I am well aware that sometimes there is an additional cost, they reassured me that there would not be any additional cost. They lied to me, as there is now there is an additional cost. Anaheim Urgent Care that takes care of the billing, said that they didn't care what I was told, that I needed to pay them the money owed. This is now 2 fold, the lack of concern from Anaheim Urgent Care billing, and the lie that I was told is shameful. You would like to think that you could trust your doctor!<//Review>

<Review>AVOID! This location was formally known as Citizens Medical Group, which I absolutely loved because of their amazing staff and the best doctor I had ever met (Dr VanTassell). Not sure if he still works at this location, but he is truly the most AMAZING physician I had ever met. He is the ONLY reason I keep coming back to this place, and sole reason this place even has "positive" reviews. In fact, most of them even mention his name. Ever since it became West Hollywood Urgent Care, their front-desk staff slowly began to change. As a current medical student, I have been exposed to the changes in patient-care that have been implemented since COVID-19. I won't be revealing names of the staff members involved in this review because I choose not be responsible for putting anyones job in jeopardy. With that said, I was appalled by the way the front desk person (who claimed to be a nurse) spoke to/treated an elderly man. This gentleman was yelled at (not over exaggerating) for not standing in the middle of the PARKING lot during the morning hours of the blazing sun just to be allowed to walk inside. Instead, he decided to wait in the shade and lean agains the wall. Probably because he has difficult standing or an undisclosed condition. Since I arrived after him, I watched him stand there, leaning against the wall, for close to 30 minutes. He had some trouble speaking English, and that's pretty much how I got involved. We live in California, I almost feel that it's imperative to have a bilingual staff member on at all times. I couldn't just stand their and not say something about their outpatient-care and was quickly shut down by the "know it all'' nurse. Unbelievable! I found it to be a waste of time to argue and decided to post this review instead. I simply want to warn people about this clinics rude staff member(s) and atrocious business model.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Dr.VanTassle & all the nurses (Especially the talented Sylvia, who gives quick & nearly painless shots.Respect) at West Hollywood urgent care have been amazing during a very stressful time. I've had to go back a few days in a row due to a pretty serious & painful burn on my leg. They have been fast, friendly & efficient. Dr.VanTassle is the best. My heartfelt thanks to all the heros at West Hollywood Urgent care.❤<//review>

I came in today to get a rapid covid test and the wait was outrageously long, which is absolutely fair because a lot of people are wanting to get tested! However, the two receptionist where completely rude to my girlfriend and I and would not let give us back our ID or insurance cards but where to told to leave and come back(without our ID and insurance) when I finally came back to wait to be called into the office the same receptionists spent the hour talking poorly about patients and how annoying it is that they are busy. Very unwelcoming place that definitely left us feeling like an inconvenience to them. We would’ve just left and came back but we needed to be tested ASAP because our roommate was tested positive and we needed to know.</review>

My visit was over three hours long. They told me I had active ear infections and needed to remove excess wax by performing ‘ear irrigation.’ They used a plastic syringe to shoot water into my ear. I shared my history of chronic ear issues and past surgeries and they insisted this was safe. I then learned after leaving that this procedure is extremely dangerous for people with my condition and that it requires special licensing to do. The person who performed this procedure was not a Doctor. I needed to go see a specialist to repair the damage that they caused, and they caused bleeding and scratching inside of my ear. I do not recommend any patient visiting this office.< /Review>

<review>Updated:
I went to this location for a covid test and was really impressed and surprised by how efficient the process was. Dr Van Tassel was great and got me in and out. I also got my results back quickly.

This was my first experience at an urgent care. I normally go to my primary care doctor but wasn't able to get in the same week. At the urgent care, I was able to see a doctor quickly and the overall process of registration was surprisingly smooth and easy.</review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

I go to the pharmacy after finally getting my prescription. The pharmacist informs me that I need a specific card in order to get the medication free of charge.  The pharmacist writes exactly what I need on paper. I then take it to weho urgent care. Tell them exactly what I need and give them the note from the pharmacist.  I wait a few min Raymond (who should not be working in any medical field at all) brings out a card and tells confirms that that is that card I need.  GUESS WHAT ?!? He was wrong.  So now I apparently have to go back to their office to get what I actually need. This is day 13 since my initial visit and still have not gotten any medication.  AWFUL SERVICE.

Absolutely the worst in terms of patient care and customer service.  NEVER come to this facility<//Review>< Response>

<resp>None</resp><review>Went to get tested COVID-19 as it is a requirement for the field I work in. I was recommend WEHO urgent care because they did accept kaiser. Receptionist was kind but her and the doctor came in and informed me he would be testing me in full PPE. Later a nurse came only wearing a mask and administered my test. Something felt off about that. They then informed me results would take 3-4 days. I called to follow up after 5 days and the nurse told me that information wasn’t in my chart. She then called me back to inform me they need to keep looking for the results. I followed up again today and they told me my results were ready and they will call me back with them. I get a call back from a receptionist informing me the DOCTOR actually has to call me and give me my results and that they no longer email results (coworker had results emailed to them that same day by weho urgent care). She told me he would call that day. Still haven’t received a call back. Very disorganized and rude. If you need testing dodger stadium is way faster and organized or just go to Hollywood urgent care.< /review>< pics>

Called the urgent care to send a patient in for EKG and chest x-ray as my office was closed. Spoke to Raymond on the phone who gave me prices for all the services individually.  Raymond met my patient at the front desk and told her "you have to see the doctor" and my patient asked why if she has a doctor and Raymond was persistent and told my patient she had no choice.  My patient felt bullied so didn't leave.  When I called to find out what happened I spoke to Linda who picked up the phone and asked to speak to a supervisor or the doctor and she said "we are closing, call back tomorrow" and pretended not to know who I was referring to and said "we have many men working here" which I found out is not true.  I reminded her I'm not a patient and had a serious issue I wanted addressed so she finally puts Raymond on the phone who's monotone, unapologetic, an direct tone was too much so I wished him a good evening and hung up.  Definitely won't be referring anymore patients to this urgent care.<//Review>

<review>This place is wonderful. I registered, got called to the back and had vitals taken in a room. 20 mins later in walks the wonderful Dr. Van Tassell. He explained in detail what was going on with me. He's just exceptional, very very friendly, and professional. I wish my PC Dr was like him. He should be proud of himself.< /review><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1581096403486, 'text': 'Thank you for your great review.

Absolutely horrible experience here. Dr. Van Tassel was completely insensitive and unprofessional. When I was telling him my symptoms he was saying things in a condescending way such as, “Uh oh! The situation is dire!” Not in a caring or professional tone but completely condescending. He never once looked me in the eye. He then said I should go to the emergency room and be prepared to wait for the entire day. I get that. But then he jokingly said if I don’t I could be “dead by Friday” again in the same condescending, joking tone. My situation was not life threatening. To cap things off he said he’d write me a note to take to the ER. I waited for the note for a half hour and finally went up to the front counter and asked about it and their response was, “oh! There you are!” I was waiting on a note to take to the ER... I don’t understand why they would forget or lose track of patient in that scenario. In summary, West Hollywood Urgent Care and Dr Van Tassel made me feel like my health concerns weren’t valid, talked down to, and down right ignored. In a time when I needed help and guidance through a medical issue I was left feeling seriously alone and uncared for.< /Text>

<text>Had to come here last minute and the staff, especially (Karina) was absolutely the most caring, courteous, helpful and extremely understanding of my situation. They took their time and didn’t rush me. The doctor was also patient and listened to me diligently. I highly recommend this place for your urgent care matters.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I've been going to Dr. Van Tassel for many years and he is a terrific doctor. He really cares about his patients and takes the time to get to know them and what is going in with their health and wellness.  He is extremely experienced and thoughtful.  I know the practice has gone through some changes, but Dr. VT is the heart and soul of the clinic, and his dedication to medicine is as strong as ever.</review>

<Rating>2<//Rating><review>The front desk ladies were awesome but I definitely can’t say that for the Dr who seen me.
He was in the room with me for no more than 3 min.
Short story.... I have what I believe to be hernia he simply said take some alive after he felt it and said if it doesn’t go away go to a general surgeon. That what I paid $159 for. Pretty rediculous if you ask me.
And as I said the ladies were great. They did take off $39 but the point of the matter is I still have no idea what’s wrong with me.
Would not recommend this UC.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<review>Originally I had a very bad experience and waited for about and hour- total time was from 11-12:45. They had to send someone to the ER but they should have come to explain the situation to me after waiting 30 minutes. Overall the staff was very friendly and she apologized repeatedly and when stopped to give me advice of things to do around the city and was super nice.</review>< username>

Bought a car from this dealer about a month ago. I went in there after just receiving my SSI after surviving an aneurysm, went there with my kids and my elderly mother. The owner Ariel didn't like questions, and was rude to us. He lied about the engine being rebuilt changing his stories and the day after the warranty expired the engine light went on. We went to the ford dealer and was told that there's no way the car could've passed smog legally. There's a multitude of issues with the car now after casual driving for just over a month.

I feel I was taken advantage of and very disrespected by the owner Ariel.
I don't recommend taking a chance with this dealer.</text>

<review>Always checking on world motors website for good reliable vehicle’s, I have purchased about five cars from them always happy with my purchase, now let’s talk about about the repair shop very knowledgeable mechanics, plus the owner is a engineer in automotive mechanics with many years of hands on experience, besides being one of the most honest person I’ve ever dealt with , Whether you are purchasing a car from him or having one repaired. Which we all know is hard to find in that industry.All that being said good luck finding a bad review on this website, if you do see a bad review Ignore it because if you know these guys over there at World Motors you know it’s not true.<//review>< pics>

<review>I went to get a transmission fluid change, and the guy was so honest with me about what was going on with my transmission fluid. Basically the guy made me feel comfortable about what my choices were and didn't try an burn me for money. I didn't receive service today but another day I will.</review>< pictures>

<Pics>None</Pics><review>I have used this mechanic for nearly 20 years and their prices, service, and honesty can't be beat. Ariel, the owner-operator of this place, is an experienced mechanic and engineer with multiple degrees. He does great work and stands by that work after it's completed. I've also purchased multiple cars from this dealer and been exceedingly happy with their price and performance. If you're in the market for a car or just need some work done, this place can't be beat.<//review></record>

Rip Off Report ..... On June 2, 2012, Gary & Vanessa Fortson purchased the [2001, Saab, 9-3 SE] from World Motors Incorporated in the amount [$4,300] . When my family and I arrived at World Motors Incorporated, I Gary Fortson test drove the 2001, Saab 9-3SE. I noticed that the fuel gauge indicated empty. The owner (Ariel Verna) indicated to my family and I that he was driving the car from his home to work daily and it was a good car.

I asked Ariel Verna if there was enough gas in the car to make it to the nearest gas station and he replied “yes”. I drove the car to the nearest gas station. I gave the gas attendant $40 to fill the tank. But, to my surprise the  2001, Saab, 9-3 SE only took $10 to fill up the tank.

Despite repeated attempts to repair the car by [World Motors Inc.], Frank’s Transmission & Auto Repair and AAA Auto Repair.  The 2001 Saab 9-3SE remains defective. The 2001 Saab 9-3 SE was sold with the fuel gauge not working,  electrical problems, motor leaks and transmission leaks.

Note: I (we) would not have purchased the 2001 Saab 9-3SE if World Motors Incorporated had disclosed all of these problems to us</Text>

<Text>Glad they dont sell betta fish and turtles anymore. No animal deserves to be confined to such a tiny space. Businesses who sell fish and turtles in cups are not businesses I  will shop at.   This store carries a variety of merchandise at low prices.  They have pet products, a large selection of balloons, electrical repair tape, paint brushes, clothes, cleaning , toys, flashlights, lighters, childrens pools, fabric or plastic by the yard, lunch bags, space heaters, fans, stationary supplies etc.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x809268e86c3bcc81:0x7c42c9ba88fd4d45< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Well stocked store, filled with modestly priced items. They have piñiatas, party supplies for almost every holiday, cookware, cleaning supplies, clothing, etc. The cashier was friendly and courteous.</review>

<Review>HORRIBLE HAIRCUT, I WONT BE BACK

Everything was pretty much okay except for the most important part, the ACTUAL HAIRCUT...The right side of my fade goes up so high up can see the top of my head while the left side is level... The back is also crooked and goes up super high. In my entire 33 years of life, I've never had a haircut this bad. I walked in after getting it done and tried to play it off like nothing had happened. My wife was on the floor laughing and I can understand why. She said it looked like the stylist used her feet and was looking in a funhouse mirror. OUCH, I agree. I'm now stuck in the house waiting for it to grow back. If I tilt my head JUST RIGHT, it looks somewhat straight. Hahaha Hah.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

I walked out less than 10 minutes later with fantastic brows. She did a better job in less then 10 minutes than the Benefit Brow Bar did in nearly 30 minutes with wax. It was also 1/3 the price of what I spent on the waxing. I bought 3 threading sessions so I will definitely be back.</review>< resp>

<Rate>3< /Rate><text>Friendly service but sometimes a long wait for walk-ins. Threading has been accurate. I've gotten a little too much taken off of my eyebrows which isn't really my style and it takes a long time to grow back. Clear salon, modern, I like how you can see all the products and implements being used. and good parking.</text>< date>

3 stars due to my kindness.
I went here a couple days ago and I'm very unsatisfied. I showed a lady a picture of what I wanted done. She told me "forget about the picture." And because of my humbleness I decided to continue with her knowing she is a licensed. Unfortunately I ended up with a hair cut that wasn't even close to what I wanted. My hair in the back is very choppy and different levels. The right side of my hair is longer then the other side. Which is supposed to be the other way around. All together I spent $29.00 definitely not worth it. They say no refunds. Thus I feel like at a time like this there should be one.. 😢😢 This has gotten to me emotionally. I hope the owner see this. I was expecting a professional hair cut.< /review>

<Review>I came in after the gym to get my eyebrows threaded, which I haven't had done in ages. I worked with Monica, who has over 15 years experience in threading. She was kind and helpful. She was also the most thorough and expedient eyebrow threading experience I have had. I am very pleased with today's experience and will be visiting again in about 3 weeks.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6iiyyg4NXChRwszridD3kqp3BWC-E5yo_6StQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

<review>The first time I came here I got amazing service.  The lady that cut our hair was really nice and did a great job.  My son, who is 3, doesn't like to get hair cuts, this was the first time he got a haircut that we were really happy with.  I recently went back in, expecting the same great service, but this time around it was a little different.  The lady who cut our hair before wasn't there so we went with whoever was available.  She didn't do a good job and I could tell she wasn't patient or good with kids.  I even heard her groan a little bit while she was cutting his hair.  To be fair he was moving around a little bit, but as a professional who cuts hair that is to be expected from a toddler.  She asked if we wanted a "line" put in and I said sure why not.  We didn't find out until later that this was an additional charge.  She didn't even do a good job on it.  I still paid, but it would have been nice to know that it was going to be extra.  The man at the front counter was very friendly and professional.  Honestly I dont think I'll ever come back after this last experience, but give them a shot to see for yourself.< /review>< Pics>

Hated my cut. I showed the stylist a picture of what I want. She confirmed she can do it. It wasn’t a complicated cut. Soft layer lob.   She chopped my hair super short and ugly not even close to the picture I showed her.

In the middle of the cut, oh by the way, your cut is $18 and if you want it dried and blow dried it’ll be $30. Even when it says on their board $10, men, women and kids. I’m not opposed to paying for more, coz I have before. She is not at all good. I said I just need a trim. Keep my hair wet. She charged me $18. I still tipped her and she said sarcastically, thank you for the $2.

Went home right away and was sad the whole day.

NOT COMING BACK EVER!!!!!!!!!!!<//Text>

Friendly staff, always satisfied with my haircut. What's with everyone thinking you have to charge a arm and a leg for a Damm haircut. It's a haircut!!! Price very reasonable.<//Text>

<Review>I visited this place yesterday for a hair cut, I took an online appointment it showed me $13 for hair cut after going there they said it’s $20 l. She took only 15min to cut my hair she didn’t apply any serum or didn’t even blow dry
I had really bad experience will never visit that store again. $20 is really more price for the haircut done by her</Review>< Pics>

WISH I COULD RATE 0! This place sux i dnt kno why i evn tipped the person who cut my sons hair usually I wouldnt hold my tongue bt for some reason i did. We are disgusted by his haircut. It was my sons 1st haircut he was so calm and sat very still until the end he moved his head a few xs but nothing major. I told the guy fade with a line up he actrd real confident he knew what he was doing. He butchered the fade so bad it looked like an uneven buzz cut i didnt realize until i was in the sun he had a lot of uneven patches and long parts smh and the line up OMG so uneven and my son moved a little instead of moving hisself when my son moved to turn his head he stayed with the clipper an took a patch out of the front. My sons dad had to take him today to see if its fixable at a real barbershop where they know what they’re doing. Instead of blaming the child for moving a little blame yourself you DO NOT know how to cut hair at all!!!!</Review>

Hated my haircut, I told the stylist specific numbers for my hair but she gave me a buzz cut instead. I was supposed to have a haircut for a party I was attending later but the haircut has ruined it. I am never coming here again.</review>

It took 25+ minutes in the drive through when we already had a mobile order. That was with a 5ish minute wait at the speaker with no word from the employee. Order was correct though and good.< /text>

I ordered the popcorn box with the 50/50 that cost me 7.99$. The photo shows a big box but instead they put it in small box of egg rolls. So much for 50/50. Don't order the popcorn at all. Waste of money and time!!! False advertisement!<//Review>

They're primary offerings aren't all that great, but they do have delicious sides. They also have good deals occasionally. They do serve breakfast all day, so that's a point in their favor<//review>

The last time we went here we ordered four meals. We nicely asked if we could have ranch with each of our meals for our fries. The lady at the window was rude telling us that we could only have two ranch cups. Our response was "since when?" She said since January. We have been getting ranch with our fries here most of the year definitely after January. My husband told the lady sorry but I don't think we will be back if you're not willing to give all of us ranch for our fries. She just responded with well you can take it up with corporate but there's nothing I can do. She said that ranch is only for chicken strips and jalapeño poppers!!! We ended up getting ranch for each of our fries but she didn't tell us she was giving them to us anyway and she was so incredibly rude I'm not sure I want to go back there. If that were the actual case she could have just nicely told us what it would cost instead of saying she can't give us what we asked for.<//Review>

Purchased 2 Sourdough jacks.  Received bread un-toasted, dry dark hamburger pattie, a slice of tomato, mayo and ketchup.  Called to complain was told to come in for replacement, requested a refund.  Took pictures of what I received.  Was told that Pedro said bring back and return the food. I wish I could post the pictures to show..  Live and learn.

< Review>
Worst customer service ever!!! The young lady that helped me through drive through was very rude and seemed like she didn’t care about taking my order. After paying they told me to pull to the side, keep in mind no one was in front or behind me at all. I pulled to the side and they took forever to take out my food, when I received my food  it was extremely cold. I also got a ranch for my salad and for my fries and there was no sauce in my food order. I told the girl and she gave me an attitude and said I don’t get any ranch and I told her I got a salad and they asked me what kind of dressing I wanted. She said it was an additional charge for each ranch. I asked if I could speak to her manager so she went inside and came back out with ranch and said “for this time I’ll give it to you, but next time you have to pay”. Her name started with an E, she was kind of sort I wish I could remember her name. But I can’t believe this, worst experience ever!!!</Review>

< Review>
The customer service is horrific, the last two times after repeating no less than four times they still got it wrong even when the screen showed correct. The last time went in and was about to pay, the cashier read the order back and it was wrong again even though the screen showed it right, after a back and forth a few time and she still couldn't get it right I just said forget it, I'll go somewhere else.<//Review>

Great Morning service during the weekday. I'm always able to come and get my food in the morning in a timely manner, and on top of that the food always seems to be made fresh and to grade A stander in my opinion. Sometimes they have me park if something isn't done but i never have to wait long. When i come in for lunch I get a Jumbo Jack combo my fries are always hot with an excellent crunch to softness ratio, and my lettuce and tomato are always great textured i have yet to be hit with the dreaded wilted or yellow lettuce or soggy tomato.<//text>

We just went through the drivethrough and we were asked to pull around to wait for the rest of our order, which came within 2 minutes. At that point, the server-Thalia- made sure we had our hashbrowns. We didn't, so she went in and got them for us. She graciously acknowledged and apologized.< /Text>

I went there at 2am and ordered a chicken club sandwich, milkshake, and two tacos. When I ordered the shake they told me the machine was being cleaned so I didn't get that and that's the 4th or 5th time that's happened. The sandwich bread was really hard. The chicken was small and over cooked. At this point I had lost my appetite and gave the tacos to my roommate.<//text>

<text>I went inside instead of the drive thru. The lady @ the counter was polite, helpful and had a sense of humor (she was a BREATH of FRESH AIR, MOST ARE RUDE, RUSHING YOU THRU, IMPATIENT BUT NOT IN YOUR STORE) There was no one else in there until after I was finished with my order. Then the counter filled up with loud screaming kids 10, a church group, a couple of families. I watched her take the orders with patience, a smile on her face. The only problem that I saw was that nobody came up to help her. She was AWESOME, she remained patient, kind and RESPECTFUL to everyone. I had to wait for the milkshakes that I ordered BUT  I FIGURED THAT IF SHE COULD BE SO KIND AND RESPECTFUL TO ALL THE CAOUSE GOING ON WITH THE OTHER GUESTS, I COULD WAIT A FEW MINUTES FOR MY MILKSHAKES. I DON'T GO TO FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS BUT I WILL BE GOING BACK TO YOURS FOR A FAST, EASY MEAL WHEN I DON'T WANT TO COOK. THANK YOUR STAFF ESPECIALLY THE YOUNG LADY THAT CHANGED MY VIEW ON GOING IN VERSUS THE DRIVE THRU. (AT LEAST JACK in the BOX. I WILL NOT GO TO ANY OTHER PLACE. THE FOOD WAS DELICIOUS AND THE PRICE DIDN'T BREAK MAMA'S BANK)< /text><user>115529685562485153224<//user>< rate>

Good food, good service, but they need to improve the mood of the interior. Because of the wall color and the windows covered with advertisements, it feels all closed in and dark.< /Review>
