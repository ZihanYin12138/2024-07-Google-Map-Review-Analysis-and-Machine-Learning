I went to use the upstairs building restroom, this morning, as I do every morning for three years. Hybrid MD is located on the ground floor.
This morning the power was off . The automatic door was not working. I asked a employee to help me enter through a manuel side door. When she met me at the door I explained, although I have been a patient at Hybrid many times, just need to use building restrom as I do every morning.
My primary health care provider (El Camino Health) is located in same building.
I have never met the employee.
However, instead of letting a 62 year old senior in desperate need to deficate inside, she told me to leave or she would call police.
HOW INSENSITIVE!!!!
I would like to know her name and speak with her.
Does Hybrid know this how they are being represented?!
I believe, I deserve a PERSONAL APOLOGY!
Hybrid does not dictate whom may enter the building!

{'time': 1620523596360, 'text': "Hi Mr. Goldberg,\n\nI am very sorry for your experience this morning but as you stated the power was out to the entire building (including the restrooms) and I instructed my staff not to allow anyone into the building until the power was restored, for their safety.\n\nPer the landlord, the only people who are allowed into the building are the tenants and active customers. Even though you use the facilities in this building (as you said) every day, you shouldn't, this is a private building, the landlord will be putting locks on the hallway restrooms to prevent this in the future.\n\nI am also sorry to say that you are incorrect about who we can allow into the building. Again, this is not a public building, each tenant pays not only the lease but also for all common facilities, it is not paid for by the city. Additionally, while I can't do anything if the doors automatically open and allow you in, we are not permitted to just allow anyone into the building if we have to control who comes in.\n\nJust a heads up, Camino Health Center has moved their primary care services to their San Juan Capistrano location and no longer see primary care patients here."}< /Response>

I am very unhappy with this place. My partner, who is immune-compromised, went in there with a previously booked appointment. They made her wait quite a while and put her in a room with a woman and her child who were not covering their faces with masks, and the receptionist had her nose uncovered by her mask too. This is an irresponsible unsafe thing to do for people getting tested during a pandemic. Places like this need to enforce proper mask wearing, both with their patients, but also with their employees! It’s outrageous the most exposed my partner has been during this entire pandemic was when she went to get tested in a medical environment. Would not recommend to anyone seriously concerned with being in a safe environment that follows pandemic protocol.<//Review>

Dr Sonya Murray was wonderful with my aunt and my baby. She listened and gave great advice. I love that she is holistic in her approach - she is careful about prescribing antibiotics and enjoys explaining natural rememdies as well. She also explained to me how to examine certain situations so I can help my baby at home the best I can. Dr. Murray is an excellent doctor. Thank you<//text>

Each time my children or I have received services at Hybrid, every employee, doctor, and manager provided us with the very best care. Everyone is very friendly, attentive and knowledgeable in various areas regarding front office and back office services. I in past was also an employee, and from the inside out I can say I fully recommend them without a doubt. As a patient or employee, I was always happy with my care and was ALWAYS treated respectfully, efficiently, and honestly.</review>

My husband took our 5yo and 3yo to the office while I stayed back w/our 4yo. 3yo was showing symptoms a couple days behind 5yo, so we wanted him to be looked at as well, if doc saw necessary, bc it is so hard to get 5yo, 4yo, and 3yo to doc when they are so sick, let alone ONE of them.

5yo had ear ache 2x in middle of night, dx'd by the doc at our visit w/inner ear infx (even though doc said couldn't be sure, bc doc couldn't see well enough, but prescribed the antibiotics anyway). Doc told husband 3yo just has allergies, not to worry about him.

Four days later, 3yo now has same ear pain, wet cough, opaque snot. I call and ask for an rx for 3yo, and it gets escalated to owner/mgr Kevin, as 3yo was not formally checked in (my husband signed in our kid with most urgent situation, wanted doc's opinion about treating son as formal patient before proceeding; since doc opined dx for 3yo as allergies and no recommendation to formally examine 3yo, husband didn't "check in" 3yo by writing 3yo's name on sign-in sheet).

Kevin straight-up (and very arrogantly) told me there is "no way" his staff failed in communicating their urgent care protocol to my husband.  He told me that what our understanding of events is "didn't happen!" and that "it is impossible for one of our staff to fail in these procedures."  He insists we bring 3yo in AGAIN for formal dx, in order to get rx.

What is shocking is the arrogance, lack of regard or compassion (though bio for Kevin says he went to Catholic HS, which might be included to imply some sort of higher moral accountability, which is evidently lacking), insistence upon US having it wrong, and straight-up telling me (without using the actual words) that we are idiots, or liars, or both.  We don't speak medical language, we don't know urgent care policies, we just know we had one really sick kid with another looking not far behind, by way of symptoms.  We would have kept my 3yo home w/me and the 4yo if we realized this is how it would play out :(

Oh, I forgot to mention that they overcollected on our co-pay substantially due to their errors on inputting my 5yo's info (which my husband had to spend time out of his work schedule to resolve behind the scenes w/insurance company yesterday), Kevin's staff put our 5yo's info into the system wrongly (which my husband had them correct, and even the correction was wrong.  When my husband tried to have them correct it AGAIN, they told him it "doesn't matter," and "don't worry about it").  And yet, thpough he admitted THIS error happened (saying this sort of thing happens all the time), Kevin adamantly and arrogantly insists it is "impossible" they failed in this OTHER point.  He insists his staff didn't fail in walking my husband through this process to meet our needs.  He said it was OUR fault for not asking the right questions.

Well, Kevin, how can we ask the right questions, if we don't even know what questions to ask?!  My husband TRIED asking the doctor's opinion about checking my son in, and was not advised to do so, because the doctor's opinion was that the 3yo has asmtha, and "don't worry about him, he is fine."

If we have to bring our kids to urgent care again, which I am sure we will at SOME point, we most certainly won't be choosing this provider, so long as they treat us this way.  We would rather drive even a half hour further and work with a compassionate and service-oriented provider where money - or being right - isn't their evident primary concern :(.  It is shocking to read Kevin's background attesting to a work background in the service industry.  My family and I certainly did not feel well-served by him :(</text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1582242558783, 'text': 'Stacy your review is equally as unfair and frustrating as the phone call that I just went through with you. Your call was “escalated to me” because my FD staff told you that we cannot call in and RX without physically evaluating a patient.  As I told you on the phone, IF your husband wanted your son to be evaluated by our doctor, he could have checked him in. It is not the doctor’s place to make that decision. Only by properly evaluating a patient can a doctor make a medical decision. I reviewed our lobby video and I spoke to the front desk staff that checked your daughter in. Your husband never asked to check your son in at any point in time. Payment- Your insurance company was closed, and their online verification service was down on Sunday so, our staff explained the temporary self-pay option (and re-verification of insurance once open) to your husband. Once verified, we would refund the appropriate amount. Your husband chose that option and as promised, after proper verification, we called your husband and refunded the amount he paid. I spoke to the doctor and she did remember your daughters visit, she said that while she was evaluating your daughter, your husband asked about your son\'s symptoms. The doctor said, "it could just be allergies, I don\'t know, if you want him seen, you will need to have him checked in to be evaluated. Your husband chose not to do that. (the process would have been just like your daughter,  same, paperwork, payment, etc., (not just a simple sign in). You said, "your family has never been to an Urgent care, you don\'t know how Urgent care offices work and you don\'t work in an Urgent care" (surprisingly, 99.9% of our patients are not Urgent Care workers). I am certain that this is not your family\'s first visit to an Urgent Care but if it was, your husband did not indicate that he was unaware, and he did not ask for advice on what he should do. Many parents bring in 2 or more kids in , although only one is being seen. Occasionally, a parent will try to get two seen for the price of one and we always tell the parent that the additional child /children, will have to be checked in to be evaluated. All visits must be documented in their own independent medical record. The doctor cannot evaluate a patient that has not been formally checked in (That is our medical protocol). I said we cannot call in an RX without a physical evaluation of a patient (not safe for patient/ malpractice issue) and although it may be inconvenient, you are welcome to bring your son in to be seen. That just sent you into another tirade about my arrogance and lack of compassion. My staff are all professionals, if my confidence in their medical judgement and following medical protocol is perceived by you as arrogance, then guilty as charged. However, basic mistakes can happen: some people wait longer then usual when we’re busy; patients can be accidentally taken back out of order; electronic RX’s don\'t get to their destination in a timely manner and yes, demographics info  can sometimes be entered incorrectly. But, breaking Medical Protocol? That absolutely did not happen! As I told you, there is no reason we would not have checked your son in, had your husband asked us to do so, it just doesn’t make any sense! You can rant and rave, as you did on the phone and here. Sadly, you can attack my Catholic faith,  you can try to impugn my character, you can hurl accusations at me. As promised, you fulfilled your threat to complain about me on Yelp and Google (that always happens when unreasonable people don’t get their way), it doesn’t matter. I have said this before and I will say this again, THERE IS AN ABSOLUTE LIMIT TO CUSTOMER SERVICE, and you have found it.

I would have expected to be contacted directly, if not the day of the visit, then within a few days of that visit. So, you can understand my surprise to find that the visit in question (and not your last visit here), was more than seven months ago.\n\nI did speak to Dr. Jairam and he did remember your visit after we reviewed your chart. However we are confused. You were fully covered by insurance at the time and many of our patients carry the same insurance as you have. In fact, more than half of our patients have the same insurance as you. So, it doesn't make sense that you say he made you feel bad because you couldn't afford insurance.\n\nAdditionally, we see patients in our office with fractures and breaks all the time, and Dr. Jairam stated that his physical exam of your arm was no different than any other patient. Unfortunately, there is no way to delicately evaluate a body part with a break or a fracture, to ascertain exactly were the break or fracture is without causing unintentional pain to the patient. This is necessary as he explained to you before touching you. He would never intentionally cause a patient more discomfort than is absolutely necessary.\n\nDr. Jairam did tell you that based on your insurance, you would need to contact your primary care physician to get a referral for an orthopedic doctor and you were not happy about that but that is the requirement of your insurance company and there is nothing that we can do about it. However, your arm was splinted and wrapped and we provided you with the only pain prescription that we write for in this office.\n\nWithout violating HIPAA guidelines, I can not say anything more here."}< /resp></record>

Don't complain about pain. The nurse said i couldn't go see DR Jay just wait and seek help frim your primary doctor. Which was closed. Doctors are supposed to make sure patients aren't in pain. But no one at this office cared unbelievable.<//Review>

Outstanding place!!!  We had to wait awhile but it was worth it. We saw a competent doctor, I believe his name was Dr. Jairam. Great doctor!.. young really caring and thorough. Took great care of my son who had the flu, got him back on this feet after a very bad bout with the crazy flu that is going around...Kinda do not want to share the great review because this will cause very one to go there, but on the other hand as a parent I know we need better doctor in our area and this place is a 10!, as far as doctors go...Thank you<//Text>

Could you please call the office (Mon - Thur, between 8am and 7pm) and ask for Kevin. I would like to look into this and talk with you about what happened to warrant your dissatisfaction.\nAs of 01/09/2020 I still have not received a call from you. I must say that your description of Dr. Jairam’s bedside manner is extremely unlike his actual personality. I have seen him deal with some pretty difficult children and not get ruffled, Something is off here.'}</response>

{'time': 1545067169779, 'text': 'Hi Mike,\nI am very sorry that you are disappointed with your visit with us. I spoke to the doctor who saw you and I understand your situation. I have reached out to you several times and left a couple of messages for you to call me back but I haven’t heard from you. It’s important to understand that there are some issues that an Urgent Care can not help you with, simply because of a lack of advanced diagnostic equipment. The course of action the doctor gave you is the best for your situation. Additionally, I have done some research and I have some suggestions that may help you get the care you need. Please contact me at the number below so I can give you that information.\n\nKevin 949-429-1919'}< /Resp>

<pics>None<//pics><text>Hybrid MD Urgent Care is absolutely AMAZING! My 7 year old son had been up since about 3am with horrible chest congestion, coughing, wheezing and was feeling horrible. I took him in and we were both joyfully greeted by Katherine & Nikki at the Front Desk. The girls were extremely polite & professional towards me, while multi-tasking and being endearing & engaging towards my young son. Even though he was sick, he had a million questions about the office and why I had to fill out paperwork. They both took the time to answer his questions with a smile all without becoming annoyed.

After completing my son's new patient packet, we were in the room within (5) minutes, and he was being evaluated by Dr. Ken Pierce within about (90) seconds of his vitals being taken by the medical assistant.

To say the least, Dr. Pierce is a great man! He came in, took the time to introduce himself to both me and my son and chat with us for a few moments before jumping into things. He didn't just try to rush through the visit like a lot of physicians out there do, unfortunately. I practically felt like we were hanging out with a neighbor, a close family friend or an uncle, etc. To have a man that can calm your young, fairly ill son with such great ease is very comforting. Dr. Pierce diagnosed my son quickly and thanked me for bringing him in and not just putting off his symptoms as a "cold."  I truly appreciated that.

On our way out, there were bottles of hand sanitizer stacked up for the patients near the exit door leading out back into the lobby. I thought that was a great touch!

After my son's prescriptions were printed up, the girls at the front desk presented him with a gift bag full of little goodies and even let him pick out a "Halloween" stuffed animal, which completely made his day! AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE!

If you want fast, effective, personalized urgent care services - Hybrid MD Urgent Care is the place!!< /text>< gmapID>

I love Hybrid MD Urgent Care. Never had a long wait in the 4 random visits I've had there this year. Always seen quickly. X-ray available on site. In office meds given and prescription. All my concerns always addressed. This is a first go to!<//text>

I had a big broken stick stuck in my foot and was able to get in to see the doctor within 20 minutes of the accident. When I arrived the staff was courteous and sweet and offered me a wheelchair or crutches. I didn't need them by appreciated their sensitivity. It was a pretty quick/ in and out procedure and I was very pleased with my service. Thank you!</review>

Normally most patients are in and out within an hour. I know waiting in the room for 18 min seemed like forever and someone should have popped in to update you on when the doctor would be in. I am very sorry that they didn’t. Unfortunately two patients were already in the back before you arrived and one person came in right before you so, you were taken back in the correct order.\nOur doctors give each patient fair time so they are cared for properly.\nI understand that you needed to pick your child up and you were in a hurry. Some visits take longer than others and I wouldn’t rush the doctor if he was with you.\nYou are welcome to come back to be seen if you like, if you make a same day appointment, you will be taken back as close to that time as possible and before walk in’s, even if they arrived before you.\nOnce again, I am very sorry for the long wait and the lack of communication.'}<//resp>

I never write reviews...but we were treated soo good here, I had to. After years of going  to the only other urgent care near by, it was so refreshing to be treated like a human again. Staff is very polite, doctor Jairam was nice and funny with my kids which made it way easier for them. Thank you. This will be our new to go place should we need urgent care.< /Review>

All of the staff the receptionist, nurse and doctor were pleasant and I didn't feel I was a disruption to their day.

I have never received a more friendly vibe from an urgent care before! Everyone who worked there, the front desk receptionists, the assistants, and Dr. Jairam, were incredibly kind and welcoming. It was a refreshing experience and overall a pleasant visit.

I went there for my first laser hair removal treatment and it was the speediest process ever. I was in and out of there by no more than 40 minutes (the treatment took about 25-30 because I had more than one area done). Dr. Jairam and his assistant were extremely comforting, professional and pleasant throughout the entire treatment and provided me with all the information that I needed to know about it. I'm really looking forward to my next treatment/visit and I would definitely strongly recommend this clinic to anyone and everyone! :)< /Review>

<review>The service was very professional and friendly in all aspects, the check in desk, the PA and the Doctor.
Doctor Jairam knew exactly what I had and needed. I was on my way in less than 30 minutes.

< Review>
Dr. Murray told us over the phone that the inflammation in the leg would go away, and to just apply heat several times a day. Turns out to be a tumor! Bad advice!< /Review>
<pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1513902193563, 'text': "Hi Chip,\nI sincerely understand how you feel and I may have felt the same way if it were me, or in your case (since you are not the patient), a family member of mine.\nI have spoken with the two physicians that the patient actually saw in our office and with Dr. Murray about the conversation with her.\nFirst and foremost, we are an Urgent Care and with the exception of X-Rays, all other imaging must be done at an outside imaging center. Additionally, we feel it is essential to rule out all the most likely diagnosis before assuming an uncommon diagnosis. However, we did not want to dismiss the possibility of a more serious condition, which is why we ordered all the necessary diagnostic tests.\nPrior to the results of the tests, the advice received from Dr. Murray was consistent with the treatment of the most likely medical conditions. In some cases, the treatment plan may change dependent upon the final diagnosis and test results.\n\nOrdinarily, we would have forwarded the results of the first test to the patient's primary care physician. Since in this case there was no primary physician on record, we followed their normal course of action which included, ordering all diagnostic testing and forwarding all test results, as well as referring the patient to the correct specialist for treatment.\n\nWith all due respect, since you are not the patient, I cannot go over all the detailed procedures because it would be a HIPAA violation. If the patient provides me with a medical release authorization, allowing me to speak with you, I would be happy to discuss further.\n\nWhat I can say is this: The time between the first visit and the referral to the specialist was extremely fast. Our doctors did their very best to provide your family member with the most accurate diagnosis and followed the proper medical protocol in the most expeditious manner. We take great care of all our patients to ensure that they receive the very best medical advice and treatment.\n\nConsidering all that I have stated, we feel your one star rating is extremely unfair!"}<//Response>< gmap_id>

<review>Almost too beautiful to eat! Out of the 9 flavors we tried, the favorites were strawberry sorbet, blueberry cheesecake, and hazelnut gelato. The flowers are the most delicious works of art. I appreciated that the employee thoughtfully arranged the flavors so that it was both easy on the eyes and great tasting as well. The best flavors were in the center and were saved for last. The perfect treat on a nice day!<//review>< pics>

Amorino Gelato first originated in Europe and has brought their Italian gelato flavors to the US. I had the pleasure of going to Grant Ave. location in San Francisco, CA which is near Chinatown. They are known for their signature gelatos that are shaped in the prettiest flowers you have ever seen topped with a macaron! I got to try their classic size gelato flower with the flavors being pistachio, strawberry, and mango topped with a blueberry cheesecake macaron. They only do take-out only and the place does its very best to follow the COVID safety procedures.

So I got the flavor combination of strawberry, mango, and pistachio. Overall, I chose a really great flavor combination for my gelato. I can really taste the strawberry and mango flavor very well and one flavor does not overtake another flavor. I thought it was really delicious and would really go back for more. I liked the pistachio too however, I wish there were more of the pistachio nuts (yes there were some but not a lot I did taste) to give the pistachio flavor to stand out more and also for texture too. I did taste pistachio however it wasn’t as dominant as the strawberry and mango flavors. The blueberry cheesecake was perfect to the taste however it was a bit too soft for my liking because when I tried to pick it up, it immediately cracked so be careful with your macarons!

Overall, this place serves really delicious gelato and the staff was super kind to me. I would definitely check this place out when you can because this is the real deal gelato you're witnessing right here!</Text>

Loved their gelato! However, the man who served us could have been friendlier. As we entered he asked us what we wanted and immediately I knew he seemed ticked off (maybe bc we came in 10 mins before closing time) and every time someone came in he would mutter something. Also, my brother ordered 2 gourmet cups but they ran out of whipped cream and I ordered 2 flower gelato specials BUT they also ran out of macarons and he still charged us full price! It was already expensive enough paying $$ for such small portions but having those portions reduced because you guys don't know how much to stock up on is something else. I was so excited to come here, especially since gelato shops are hard to find where I live given than I'm lactose intolerant, all to be left disappointed when we left. All I can say is, ya'll can definitely find better places for half the price.< /review>

Different varieties of gelato and sobert. Staffs are friendly. There are tables in the back.
Gelato not as thick as I would like but flavors are good.

You order at the cashier first before they let you sample, and you can get as many diffendif flaborf as you want, as long as it fits into the cup, but they recommend 2-3 flavors for a medium cup.
About $6 for medium, compare to other ice cream shop like Salt and Straw，the medium here is more like a small size.< /Text>

Numerous flavors of gelato and sorbet plus crepes and waffles fresh baked plus chocolate covered cones all waiting to be filled up or piled on top with scoops of 16 flavors of yummy cold dessert frozen goodness.!!! Wow!! What a treat !!. We each tried a large bowl with three flavors of their daily made gelato and sat outside in the sun and tried to slurp up the  best combos we could think of before dripping on ourselves.. We will definitely be here again before we head back to cold ski country where we live.. We should look into a franchise in Utah... What a fun thought..

<review>Charming, comfortable addition to a somewhat hectic area of the city.  Small comfortable arm chairs and tables to enjoy bespoke coffee beverages. Lovely assortment of baked goods.  The gelato of course is second only to the warm and welcoming wait staff.  Luckily, it's close to home and a welcome break from the chaos of Union Square.<//review>< user>

This place is amazing! The staffs are super nice and super friendly. They make the ice cream with such care, you can tell they are thoroughly enjoying what they are doing. Love the flavours too. I ordered tiramisu and dark chocolate...it was absolutely yummy!<//Review>

<text>Amorino is a decent chain with some interesting flavors and good presentation. However with all the great options in SF, I'd not choose to go back here over other places. Portions are also small and overpriced.< /text>< GmapID>

Ice-cream for me is just Ok but they do have a lot of flavors and I haven't tasted them all. The macaroons are great. But they only get three stars because I think they are way too overpriced. I do know they make the ice cream look like flowers but that is not worth the money.< /text>

He was very friendly and did his job at the same time of pleasing the consumer :) The lime basil is so refreshing for a normal summer day. The blueberry cheesecake macaroon 2 LIVE 4! So creamy with no cream!! So GOOD :)

Worst waffle I have ever had in my life. Waffle sticks were not fresh and was reheated again and than it was not even warm. Also chocolate sauce was sparsely used. Staff does not really act on his own, but delivers food to the table.</Text>

Felt in love with Amorino in NY. By the time I managed to visit Amorino shops in LA, Houston and SF. Every time the ice cream was FANTASTIC. Not to mention that only the best ingredients from all over the world are used in the process of making the ice cream  e.g. vanilla from Madagascar, etc. One of must see places for every ice cream lover< /Text>

Probably about 16 though I did not count them.   Had a small cup of hazelnut and blueberry cheesecake.   They can put up to four flavors in a small cup but I just opted for the two plus a bit of whip cream on top.   Sooooo good.<//Text>< userid>

Amazing, authentic Italian Gelato right off Union Square.  The gelato is served looking like a flower, just like the photo.  Don't go to Union Square without stopping in.  You will not be disappointed!< /review>

It's fine gelato. My ice cream I make at home is much better. But this stuff is fine, although expensive. I usually get a small: half sorbetti, half gelato.</review>

The sorbets are quite artificial and don't taste any good. I tried Raspberry and Mango in two separate occasions and both taste very artificial, other flavors are fine.< /review>

Interesting place. Went there with a friend, I got pistachio,  hazelnut, chocolate and straciatella. Chocolate and hazelnut were great, pistachio was ok, flavorwise. What was annoying is the fact that you have to buy first (pay for a cone, cup etc.) before trying out different ice creams. You then tell them what to put into your cone/cup. While they tell you that they will refund you if you don't want anything, it is clear that they are betting on the fact that people are too lazy to ask for a refund.
Girl at the counter was quite slow, both in terms of working as well as answering our question. Manager seemed annoyed by the fact that we were annoyed that we had to pay first before tasting.

Ice cream: 4/5
Service: 3/5

(Translated by Google) Great ice cream, of course expensive for Italians standards, about $ 5 for two flavors, but you can get great pictures with their particular composition in the shape of flower.

(Original)
Ottimo gelato, ovviamente costoso per gli standard italiani, sui 5 dollari per due gusti ma potrete ottenere splendide foto con la loro particolare composizione a forma di fiore.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) The best gelato I had at the Bay Area. It's like I'm in Italy. The gelati come from Paris. There are macaroons stuffed with gelato; awesome ! Try organic chocolate sorbet, coconut, caramel gelato, etc. Go for it ! I recommend a lot, a lot.

(Original)
Le meilleur gelato j'ai eu à la région de la baie. C'est comme je suis en Italie. Les gelati viennent de Paris. Il y a des macarons fourrés au gelato; genial !  Essaie le sorbet de chocolat bio, de noix de coco, le gelato de caramel, etc. Allez-y ! Je recommande beaucoup, beaucoup.< /text>

The cloth were overwhelming as we as the color scope; orange, biege, usual black, brown, grey etc. boring and thick cloths. Using a color wheel it lack 4 colors on the wheel. In the day theft stored would divid it up into a color wheels. Now just conserve your ink.
Decently priced litely stock with healthy untensil, electronic and bags etc. over board on holiday item for Xmas.
New year is my thing and im happy to recover and servive another year, especially during COVID19.
Please shop their they are full up stock and the clerks are pleasant.< /Text>

< Review>
A very poorly designed store. I went out of my way to swing by to make a donation but  couldn't because a truck was at the store. Apparently, you cannot make a donation when a truck is there due to safety reasons. There were 2 carts not near the truck where I could have dropped my items but was not allowed. A total waste of my time. I will not return nor donate here again.<//Review>

<text>A smaller Goodwill, but very nicely kept, no "thrift store smell", and the staff was very nice. They did however have A LOT of stained items, and a very small household goods section. Great place to find kitchen items though!< /text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

They don't want donations.  I took a very nice shoe rack that's in perfect condition and cost about $45 new in to the donation area and they just yelled at me "No!" over and over.  Very strange, and rude!  Every other goodwill I've been to has been grateful for anything I've offered.  I never donate junk.  I certainly won't try to donate anything else at this location!<//Text>

If you've been spoiled by city Goodwill locations that contain plenty of high-end treasures, you will be disappointed by the Alameda Goodwill. While the staff are friendly, this location is small with limited parking, the quality of merchandise isn't great, and the clothing is all lower quality brands that have been washed/worn extensively. Additionally, and this is a bit weird, the clothing is all priced the same (eg, all shirts are the same price, all pants are the same price, etc). The household goods are also well-used. They do have a bin with used records, and a wall of used books, which may be worth checking out if that's your thing.<//review>

This is the Goodwill where I drop off most of my donation. I was in there the other day looking for some used vase. Their prices seem to be pretty high with small selections.< /text>

They have an ok selection of things but for used clothing it is a bit pricey. One thing that bothered me is that they offered me a senior discount and it's at least 25 years before I am a senior.< /Text>

<Review>I LOVE LOVE LOVE my 2011 Acura TL I bought from Lion's Auto Sales!!! I haven't had one single problem with it since I bought it 3 months ago.

Even if you have bad credit, no credit, or whatever your situation is... Gino will be able to help you out. Very nice man! Everyone at Lion Auto Sales is very professional and helpful. Not pushy at all.

I highly highly recommend buying your next auto from Lions!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x809ada2b631945f3:0x9486737f2c030554</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Hi everyone! We are pleased to be open with our community regarding our recent purchase at Lions Auto Sales. We recently purchased a Beautiful white 2010 X5 48i and are extremely satisfied with our purchase.  Our vehicle was very clean and it reflects high quality.  Our seller and owner made sure we would drive a safe vehicle and replaced our front and rear brakes and a oil change at no cost to us. Needless to say they were very helpful and friendly with our loan and making sure all of our needs were met. Thank you for the pleasant experience and we most definitely recommend this family owned car sales dealership to other families or people buying their first car. Now we are enjoying our amazing BMW! 😉< /review>

Gino is a really good salesman, kind and helpful enough. But I can't recommend buying cars from Gino's dealership. And if you decide to buy a car, then you should make a thorough diagnosis from a mechanic. We were enchanted by Gino's kindness and did't test the car properly, so we had a lot of problems with the car. The repair price turned out to be about 6k and therefore we had to urgently sell the car, less than a year has passed since the purchase. Unfortunately, I DON'T RECOMMEND this dealership.<//review>

Gino and Shadi made our car buying experience THE BEST we’ve ever encountered! If you’re looking to buy a car THIS is the place to go!! We arrived and were greeted in a timely manner and they did everything in their power to make sure were got approved and drove home in the car we wanted. I couldn’t have asked for a better car buying experience! If we could we would give 10 stars! ⭐️
Ps they hooked us up with some kickass insurance and lots of coverage for a good price 🤗</review>

<Review>Gino took care of me, he took the time to help me find the perfect car for me and my kids. I brought two cars from him so far and both cars are great. If you looking for someone that will be honest when it comes to buying a car go to lions auto sales and ask for Gino.< /Review>< Resp>

While at work, Gino was able to get an pre-approval on the Infiniti Q50 that I want, he made it as easy as it can get. Once I got there after work, we signed the paperwork & out I went with my new car! Gino’s a real gem!! Great customer service, knows what he’s doing & can make your car purchasing as easy as a pea! I would definitely recommend anyone I know to Lions Auto Sales!! Again thank you to Gino & his team!!< /Review><userid>104048528712804432189</userid></record>

They have a wide selection of different vehicles with good prices. They were able to get me financed quickly with no down payment. Even fixed minor blemishes  that I had no problem with and made the car look great. Gino has great customer service and goes above to help and make you satisfied. Had a small problem arise and it was taken care of at no cost, quickly with no worry on my part and even loaned me a car to make sure had transportation. He went above and beyond and made this buying experience my best for sure. I will and would definitely use them again and would recommend them to anyone.< /text>

I got good service, felt taken of, negotiable, friendly. It's a car dealership and nothing really stood out as "WOW they're amazing", but I also didn't feel beaten up afterward. Walked, or should I say, drove away happy.<//text>

<rating>5</rating><text>I have been looking for a car for a month.  I went all over Sacramento, to so many dealerships.  My last stop was lions auto.  Gino was the best!  He was always happy and laughing and kept my husband and I entertained.  But most of all, he was honest! He delivered on his word.  Everything he said he was going to do was done.  He is a man of integrity, which is rare these days, and especially in the car business.  I already recommended my sister to see Gino to purchase her next car.  5 stars isn't enough .  Don't go anywhere else for your car purchase!!! Thank you so much Gino for all of your help... whoever gave that 1 star review is a hater for sure :) 5+ stars all day</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x809ada2b631945f3:0x9486737f2c030554< /Gmap_id></record>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>Purchased the first car. It was a pos. Died on the side of the freeway. After supposedly being fixed it did it yet again. Got a different car. The moon roof went out the seat broke drove all the way back to Sacramento told they could not fix it and to take it to the dealership and they would pay for it to be fixed. They were supposedly going to order a part and ship it to me. I have yet to receive the part .Now the check engine light it on. Do not waste your time or money. Car salesman Geno seemed nice at first but after first car broke he was very rude and talked down to me. Terrible experience.  Rude sales people, refusal to help. Brakes went out and master cylinder. 1850.00 to repair. less than a year later turbo and wastegate need replaced 3500.00 to repair. Stuck with $10,000.00 lemon. Please I beg you spend your time and hard earned money else where. Worst experience ever.  ohh if I could show you the texts they have sent me.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<review>Gino was absolutely wonderful to work with! My husband and I drove around to the different dealerships on Fulton Avenue for hours with no luck on finding a car that we both liked. As soon as we got to Lions Auto Sales, Gino greeted us and was so helpful. He was very honest about the pricing and conditions of the cars. We test drove a few cars and found one we loved. Gino got us in and out of there very quickly with very reasonable financing. I'd definitely recommend them to anyone!</review><GmapID>0x809ada2b631945f3:0x9486737f2c030554<//GmapID><username>Paige Uliano< /username><pics>None<//pics>< Rate>

A very BIG THANK YOU to GINO and the staff for the great customer service. I recently purchased a 2007 Nissan Armada. Gino took great care of my family and I while we were there. The car was in great shape for a used car, and when I brought up some issue that I noticed with the car Gino assured me that it would be taken care of and fixed. I would highly recommend this dealership to my close friends and family. I left feeling very assured.
Thank You Again GINO<//review>

I had an amazing time purchasing my car from Lion auto sales! Gino was seriously the best! I told him before I arrived over the phone that I had to be out of there by a certain time and he made sure I was out of their even earlier than what he promised me! I didn't feel any pressure when it came to buying the car! Most dealers are just looking out for the best interest of themselves. Gino wasn't this way at all! I wanted a different car that would ultimately cost me way more down the line to fix and he didn't want that for me! It's very rare and hard to find a dealership who isn't just eager to get the sell!!! He was looking out for me and I truly appreciate him for that!! I'm very pleased and happy with my purchase! Every request I had he fulfilled.💕 So if your considering getting a car from here. PLEASE DO! You will not be disappointed at ALL! Thank you so much Gino for all of your help! I'll be back in the future as well when I'm ready for a new car.</review>

GINO is amazing! Great customer service. I came in knowing what car I wanted, there were a few minor things that needed to be fixed and Gino had them all fixed no questions asked. Very professional but also very funny! I bought my first car here yesterday and I’m very pleased. Gino always tries to make sure the customer is happy. Thank you<//text>

Gino was awesome!! He was able to get us financed with a monthly payment we could afford. - Even with less than perfect credit.

The car needed new spark plugs and they fixed it right there before we bought the car!!!!!

If you are looking for honest people with great customer service when you are trying to buy a car......look no further!!!
Thanks Gino, we loved your service!!!</text>

Then on the way home the check engine light came on and since then its been check engine light after check engine light. Turns out after a massive tire blow out the tires put on the vehicle were over 10 years old. Theres been damage or an accident to the passengers side, but being an unexpecting single mother of 2 looking for a quality SUV with low miles I was easy pickings. It took me so long to write this review because we really enjoy driving it and the third row is awesome so the car itself I love the problems I dont....fast forward to today come to find out the 1 key I was given (promised theyd mail the spare never showed up) is a valet key more money and problems. If your going to respond that I was never I customer Ill attach copies of receipts and finance paperwork. This is an honest review.

I have been coming to Lions Auto for five years. The owner is one who truly cares for his customers and is a man of his word. When I was going through a horrible divorce he helped me get a good car,  and helped my daughters get their first cars. We've never had any problems with our cars. I'm thankful for all that they've done for me and my girls</Review>

I came here to find a car, and I ended up taking a huge loss. This place is disgusting. Gino never holds up his side of the bargain. I felt like I was running in endless circles. He loves to make fake promises, anything to make money,  right? Extremely dishonest. Would never recommend this sham of a place to anyone. He said he would call back to go over the car details and he never bothered to call. They don't care about anyone but money. It's so sad to see money hungry people scam innocent people. He also has family members do ratings and reviews for this place so they have good reviews. Everything is so deceiving. Don't bother coming here people!<//review>

<Text>Went to over 10 dealerships over the last week looking for a car and it was not at all fun until we got here. Its a family owned business and the brothers were attentive to what we were looking for and found a way to make everything work out just the way we asked. Nice working with car salesmen who have an interest in making the customer happy while making the sale. If you are looking for a car..I recommend you at least stop by and check out the inventory here.. It wasa  super reasonable in price too!</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Review>Thanks to Lions Auto sales and Gino😉 for great customer service. I have been up and down Fulton looking for a 2008 Audi a3. I found three of them in different dealerships. The cars were very clean, but customer service was extremely horrible. I gave up hope on used dealerships until I met Gino. He got me the car I wanted with low miles, great finance with a low monthly payment. I will definitely recommend him to friends and family. There are still honest people out there. Thank you for your honesty and amazing service.< /Review>< pictures>

The financing went smooth and found my daughter a very nice car for a great price. They even put a brand new battery in the car while we were doing paperwork. Thanks again everyone we'll be back to buy my truck from you guy's..👍😁<//review>< Resp>

I had been looking for the right car and after visiting quite a few used dealerships I'm so glad I ended up at Lions Auto Sales! The pleasant atmosphere and Gino's enthusiastic yet relaxed attitude instantly made me feel comfortable. I found a car I really liked but it was getting late so I came back the next morning with my fiancé and he had saved the car I for me even though someone else was interested in it. We got there just in the nick of time! I'm so thankful and appreciative for their extra care and easy-going way of business that made the car buying process less stressful... fun even! Highly recommend!< /review>

<Review>By far the BEST car lot I’ve ever gone to. Shadi, the owner treats me like family. I bought my car 4/2016 but the length of time that he’s assisted me surpasses that. I bought my car without a warranty, as is but he still takes care of me if there are ANY issues with my car. If he doesn’t have something I need or want he makes sure to get it at his cost and makes no profit off me. He’s AMAZING!! I will NOT go to another dealership again!!! I’d recommend them to anyone anyway.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<review>A few months ago I needed to find a car for my son and we visited Lions.  All I can say is that we had a wonderful experience. We brought the car back because we thought that it wasn't working right...but Gino and crew showed us how some of the accessories worked and all was fine. Gino gave us the same hilarious and warm attention after we bought the car as he did before we bought the car. The team worked with us on our crazy financing and made us not just satisfied but  happy customers. All I can say is be open and honest with them so that they know what you need. Lastly....our used car was a 2010 Accent and it had to be the most immaculate used car we test drove during our car buying adventures...they really try to take care of the details.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Great customer service. Gino was very helpful, gave us all the information we asked for, made sure car was all good to go. Got my payments down by a huge amount and even tried to help get more me more affordable insurance. Car wasn't filled up on gas and he even gave me money to fill it up. If anything were to go wrong I could just come back and he'd take care of it. Very comfortable lounge and nice people who work here! I'd definitely come back! I was unlucky for over a month searching for a car up and down Fulton Ave so thank you so much Gino and crew!<//Review>

<user_id>110097304895988425808<//user_id><review>Very dishonest. No reason to trust them and I would never refer this place to anyone.  They will tell you one price and tell you oh yeah don’t worry I’m going to give you a great deal. They know it is your first car purchase and have never seen a contract before so they act like they have your best interest in mind so you do as they say or they gloss over things. You go back the next day to sign paperwork and they only gave you $180 off of the asking price for a car that has been sitting there for almost 3 months . They like to talk to you like you are old friends but when it comes time to deliver,  don’t expect them to care. They will tell you what you want to hear and pretend they fixed something they said they were “going to take car of -no problem”, when in reality they didn’t do anything. Don’t expect them to reply to you once you drive away with their car that needs a lot of work. Purchased a car less than three weeks ago, one week out of that they had it in their possession to supposedly fix things we noticed before signing papers.  They basically lied and said “oh yeah we checked this and we checked that everything was perfect. “That was a load of BS . Our Car needs to go in the shop and who knows how much it will cost!<//review></record>

<text>All thanks to Gino for a great buying experience. I’m a first time buyer and wasn’t too sure about the process, but everything went smoothly with the help of Gino. He’s a friendly and approachable person that I felt comfortable talking to regarding my credit score and income. My wife and I got our first SUV today from Lions Auto Sales.<//text>< Pictures>

I was moving to Sacramento and needed a car ASAP. From across the country Gino helped me with getting me pre-approved for a loan. Once I landed he was ready and enthusiastic to show me a few cars he had in mind for me. This is a used car lot so some of the cars can use some work but Gino is no sleeze man. He can honest and prepared. If I need to get another car in the future, Gino is my man.</review>

We had looked online for weeks for a certain car that my son wanted. We found a few in Sacramento area, so we drove a couple hours from Reno to check them out. The others were a waste of time - car condition misrepresented, rude sales people, etc.  Lions Auto was the best - not just because they had the right car, but the price was excellent.  We didn't even need to haggle or heavily negotiate like at most car lots.  Gino was courteous, knowledgeable, and funny. His laid back demeanor made the deal easy.  He got my son (a first time buyer) financed with great terms and with the monthly payment that he wanted and can afford.  Would have no problem recommending Lions Auto (and Gino!) for a pre-owned auto!</text>

<text>I recently purchased a Jetta from here, after looking around for a while i was getting so frustrated with  trying to get into a car that I know was reliable and would last for my son and I. I don't have the best credit at all and they helped me get into something I could afford and I actually liked. I was feeling pressured by other lots to buy something I didn't want. I am happy and will suggest Lions to my friends!<//text></record>

I drove 70 miles to test drive a car and Gino definitely made it worth my time! Ultimately I found the 6 speed of my dreams at a fantastic price, and they even delivered it to me in Oakland! Did I mention they gave me a 30 day warranty? Shout out to USAA customers. Lions has a great selection of pre-owned vehicles and the customer service to match!< /text>

<review>Bought a car from here and Gino treated me like I was family. He made sure when I left I was confident in my purchase and when something went wrong with my car, even though I purchased it “as is” he took care of me. I’d recommend them to everyone I know.< /review><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x809ada2b631945f3:0x9486737f2c030554< /Gmap_id></record>

<text>Working with Gino to find me and my fiancé a new car was great. We had already been to two dealerships who couldn't help us as we had bad credit. We were exhausted but in need of a car badly as ours had broken down. We walked in knowing exactly what car on his lot we wanted as I had looked it up online already. Gino worked hard to get us a great lender with prices in our price range. Family oriented and so fun to talk to! The process of buying a car can be grueling but Gino made it great! Thank you so much Gino!</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<review>This place is a dirty scam! DON''T waste your time or money here!! Gino is a liar, his real name is Shaddi.  All he does is lie. He sold he a messed up car and won't even own up to it. He DID not disclose any REAL information about the car. He fooled me. Now i'm stuck with a faulty car and stuck with repairing it all myself. So please don't waste your time here with these clowns.<//review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x809ada2b631945f3:0x9486737f2c030554</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Hands down, no question,  best service ever!!!
I bought a vehicle from them.... it's a very nice car, very clean. . But like life, things happen... their ended up being a small issue, not only did they fix it for me ( dud not pay for a warranty ) but they paid for me to have a rental car for 2 days while it was being fixed... at no cost. ..

Best service ever!!!

Went to by a car at lions auto sales, met Gino there very nice man no pressure took his time with me no rush, explain to me about the cars on lot , i end up buying a 2007 lexus gave me a really good deal on the price and great finance. Also went out of his way to make it happen, i highly recommend this place if you are looking for a car come and see Gino you will not be dissappointed..</Text>

If I could rate this place,  I would give it a zero. The purpose of a car dealership is to be truthful, honest, and giving your customers your best interest. First and foremost, this place is full of lies. "Gino" or whatever his name is, keeps saying his partner "Shaddi" is the owner. Gino is not even his name and made up this other man "John" to be Shaddi. I came to see a car and he  kept adding these random "add ons". Everything was confusing and a wild goose chase. He is a scammer and liar nor does he care about his customers. So please be careful when buying a car, they might scam you big time.< /text>

A'lam the business owner is such a nice guy, he made us the best grape fruit bowl hookah. Just amazing. Nice hookah lounge, really chill and friendly. Good prices and great service. I love the self service tea and coffee system here. It makes it much faster and easier for the customers.
10/10 and recommended.
Also very clean restrooms which is a huge plus.

Amazing customer service and super tidy place. The owner Alam is a great man and makes the best flavors, also provides great customer service and very quick to respond if you need any help with your hookahs. Definitely recommend this place, if you are in the bay make sure you guys come through to this spot!!<//review>< pics>

It's a very nice hookah lounge. It was a commute to get here and it's worth it. They know their hookah, they have the Khalil mamoon hookahs and disposable hoses as well as the starbuzz hookahs. I'm impressed to find this on the west coast. Back in NY we have great places but this is the best I've visited on the west coast.<//Review>

Decent place. Low peaceful music just as I love it. The place could do with some more lighting. All in all a good spot for hookah.</text>

<Text>Friendly staff that checked in on us a couple times to make sure everything was fine.  Clean place, but the hookah was sub-par.  Which I'm fine with but some may see that as a star reduction.

There are options to have a fruit bowl, premium hookahs, tea, and there are TVs.</Text>< userid>

We work and will work our best to please our Loyal Customers.  We hope we can give you better experience.\nWe have one of the best air/smoke ventilation system on the peninsula, which works great! Its not an easy experience to feel and not your problem as well!  But this was a very rare time (3days) of history for the Bay Area to get this kind of heat. For all residents of peninsula have encountered this situation and are mostly resolving it.  We are getting a new AC system put in soon, so that we can provide nothing less then a great experience for our Loyal customers!\nThank you\nParadise Management'}</Resp><Text>We visited this place on June 10 there was no ac no fan working and the temp was above 102 degrees it was in the afternoon cuz we have to stop to replenish our energy the workers kept apologizing cuz it’s rare to be that hot in the summer but still as a respect to ur customers u should have ac going for those who smoke inside the tender overcharged above the listed price on the menu they offered us free cold water cuz of the weather but still that doesn’t mean u have a hookah bar with no venting or ac system and it’s a quite big lounge not small< /Text><Name>Mido Alex<//Name>< UserId.>

<text>We stopped in to Paradise Hookah to kill some time before picking up a friend at the airport.  Tesh was very attentive and eager to give us the best hookah experience possible.

Reasonable price, quick service, long-lasting hookah (no refill needed for an hour and a half, 2 people).

The interior was really dark, with only dim lights around the walls, kinda like a club.</text>< pics>

The owner is cool, very welcoming but always on his phone. 4 stars because sometimes they have cover charges which I think sucks, but it's only on special occasions.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) The shisha is excellent. But its laws and regulations are difficult
And the hookah teacher is a legal expert.

<Text>This is one of my go to places for in person and online sewing supplies. I especially love the quality of their used machines and dress forms. Some of the dress forms are priced a bit high for their level of cleanliness, but others are priced great if you can be patient.</Text>< Pictures>

<text>I called and to make sure they still had the product and also if they were open regular times and then I come 50 minutes before closing, and some guy locking up the gate said they are closed.. I mean I would understand if you told me you were going to leave early, but dont tell your customers your going to be open, I drove 40 mins just to come pick up because you said you were open. Please don't do that to your next customer or everyone is going to find a new supplier. Thanks for taking my time.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Awesome service. The tech "balanced" my new scissors (shears).
Give yourself extra time because.. be prepared to be fascinated at the hardware store of sewing. They have all the things.</text>< pictures>

Beautiful shop!! Friendliest owner and employees!!

While on a mission to find an inexpensive, used mannequin for sale, I happened across IDS while en route to a display store in downtown LA. Intrigued by a window of gorgeous dressmaker forms on display, I went inside to see if they rented or sold mannequins as well. WOW! What a beautiful store! Although I’m not a person who sews, I could see that anyone who does sew, would appreciate the incredible selection of implements and tools of the trade. The shop is quaint and merchandised with a keen eye for detail; filled with decorative accents throughout and cool rustic finishes. Rosa (the lovely owner!), greeted me and began her search for a form or mannequin in the storage room. In moments, she procured a full mannequin and told me that she didn’t need it, that it was just taking up space. I was so thrilled! But then the most incredible thing happened - she GAVE me the mannequin!! She didn’t want anything for it, she just wished it to be used instead of sitting in storage. No one gives things away, ever. This kind act saved my entire month. Thank you again, Rosa!

Rosa Casarez has established herself as an artist and it shows. Do yourself a favor, take a break from online shopping and go visit IDS-LA! You’ll enjoy the ambiance and probably find something to inspire you!<//review>

<text>I have been a Fashion student for 2 years now, and I have never found a better store for supplies than IDS. On my last visit, I mentioned to Rosa how my sister and I were planning on starting a small clothing business soon. The result of that conversation, Rosa gave me a bag full of free fabric, refusing any amount of money that I offered to pay her. The people there are not only down to earth and kind, but very knowledgeable  when it comes to sewing paraphernalia. They always know exactly what you need. All I can say is " GO TO IDS ", you will find no better store. IDS is the best sewing supply store there is!<//text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

I ordered some sewing supplies over the phone, for a class I am taking at a California community college. The person helping me asked about the college I was attending. She knew exactly what I needed. She did not try to push me to buy things that were not on the list. The items arrived well packaged and protected. No problem at all.</text>

Into pattern drafting you must check out the supplies they offer here. Looking for a dress form they have them and sewing machines along with feet and bobbins. Taking a college class make sure you pick up your industrial supplies here!</text>

Motivated, knowledgeable and friendly service. They have all the tools you can possibly need. In the off chance they don't have something, they can order it. One stop shop. I plan on going back often.< /review>

<review>I've been to this business a total of three times and each time, the sales lady was very rude towards myself and other customers. Being that I am a fashion design student of LATTC I was referred there by the teacher. And I may add that I had a ton of questions in attempts to purchase the correct items, she was rude, short and always had a major attitude. The worst part is I wanted to buy a juki industrial machine and overlock yet I would dare not spend that type of money with a person with a bad attitude. They really need to attempt to do better or get friendlier people working for them</review><Name>T. Wheeler< /Name></record>

<Review>If you don't want to be cheated and waste your money do not buy sewing machines at this place. I bought industrial sewing machine at this place and it gives me problem every few weeks. First rotary hook broke, than foot lifter, than thread tension mechanism, than it started to broke needles, threads and skip stitches. When I brought this machine to experienced Juki machine mechanic he said it happens because this machine was assembled from non-original juki parts, i.e. many parts in this machine came from other random machines. In addition they sold the machine without oil pan. When I asked them about it they persuaded me it can work without oil. I am not a mechanic and didn't expect they cheat people. The result-- wasted money for machine, for repair about $200, nerves, time. I own a small business and I lost a lot of orders. Don't go to this place!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<userid>117570931543201543798</userid><text>DR. Armen Gasparian. DDS

PROFESSIONAL, POLITE, CARING, GENTLE, NO PAIN and AFFORDABLE!

Just had 6 teeth removed today in preparation for upcoming work and the doctor not only made sure the entire procedure was completely pain free, but that I also walked out with a PERFECT temporary smile.
DR. Gasparian, DDS, at Westside Dental Care, is without a doubt the best dentist I've ever been to HANDS DOWN!
Thank you so much for taking your time and providing the best treatment I've ever had and treating me like a human being instead of a piece of meat.

I’ve been going to Dr. Sarkissian for 25 years and he is the most hardworking, dedicated and thorough health professional I’ve ever met.

My entire family has gone to him and my mom paid for braces for all 4 kids through his plans. Dr.S really knows how to hire staff, everyone that has ever worked in his office is well trained and always thorough. He has offices in Woodland Hills and in Palmdale. I highly recommend you visit him for all your dental needs.< /text>

I LOVE MY DENTIST.! I had a popcorn kernel shell tucked under my gums causing inflammation and unbearable pain.  However, within 15 minutes the Dr. ever so gently removed the shell to my astonishment without numbing the area. I can now enjoy the rest of my vacation. Thank You Doc. and your Beautiful Staff!<//text>

Really friendly staff! Great service and they’re also very informative about how much your insurance covers and are willing to answer any questions you may have. During the actual service, they made sure to address different areas of concern and why they are a concern and also provided ways to prevent my teeth from getting damaged-overall they made me feel like they cared! :)</Text>

<text>Dr. Sarkisian and his Entire staff have been Wonderful to work with. I had invisalign braces and veneers and bleaching done recently. The process was long but the bi-monthly visits were pleasant due the cheerful demeanor of the office! Vanessa, Sonja and Dr S are Remarkable people and I can't thank them enough for getting my smile Perfect for my wedding in less than a month. Your patience, dedication and compassion is worthy of this Glowing review.

< Review>
I had an appointment at 0900 today 7/5/18 and I was received and taken in for examination on time.  The staff, dental assistants, and dentists were very courteous and let me know what they were going to do before they performed it.   Had to have x-rays taken and it was an unpainful process not like in the past.  Overall experience rating of 5 out of 5.  I do have to come back for a cavity, but I know I am in good hands.  Outstanding experience.< /Review>

<Review>Rite aid has the worst pharmacy phone service!  Trying to place a prescription refill is almost impossible.  Why isn't there a direct ext to pharmacy?  You have to listen to Covid vaccination information,  store hours & location before asked for prescription #s or if need to talk to someone.  No one picks up the call to speak to !  So ridiculous & frustrating!</Review>< Time>

<Text>I am only giving them a 5 star because they honestly try their best at this pharmacy. HOWEVER, they desperately need help. I do not know if it is because Rite Aid is too cheap to add additional help or if it is the infamous Covid excuse.  I know for a fact it is not the Covid excuse because this location has been limited on staff in the pharmacy for at least 20 years that I know of.
These are good people.... they just need more hands. Because I can never get through when I call. And nobody wants to wait an hour after showing up to be told that it is not filled yet. Even though the Doctor called it in or sent it via internet hours prior. Come on corporate, help them out. They deserve that much.<//Text>< Pictures>

< review>
They made me wait a month to get my prescription. As someone with severe depression and anxiety it can be really life threatening to not receive your medication on time. They take forever to answer the phone and it's frustrating not getting the voicemail notifications that tell you when your prescription is ready.<//review>

I really like this store because of the manager Lindsey she is very helpful knows her store like the back of her hand basically and is very personable with her customers. She has helped me a few times when I was in there and honestly if I need help when I am there I always ask for her first. Thank u for the great customer service and keep up the great work!!</text>

They close their pharmacy drive-thru at 5! NOT 7. Yes, they are opened IN the store, but at least put a permanent sign stating your window hours of operation if they are not the same as walking in. Some of us have kids in the car and can't be getting out with them, it's a hassle having a baby & toddler.<//review></record>

Okay pharmacies but can be annoying at times since the wait times are absurdly long and they won't even have your item ready after half an hour of waiting. Pro: They have an ice cream shop and cool random items(Toys, As seen on TV, ETC.) Con: The ice cream shop is usually not manned and requires you to ask someone at the counter for help and random items are really useless so 3 stars for me.< /text>

I have been told every time that I have arrived that my insurance (which has been the same for all the years I have come) was canceled. Then forced to wait for the pharmacist (who was here when I arrived) to get back from break while there was a line of patients waiting for medications. From the look of the past reviews, this is a recurring issue that shows no sign of stopping.< /review>

Brought prescription at 4 and they said it would be ready at 6. I came at 630 and they still say 15 more minutes. They keep running an insurance i asked them not to and to remove from my profile. I asked many times to run medical and they don't so it wastes my time as well as their's when they have to re submit the prescription with the right insurance. They need more staff. This used to be a decent pharmacy. I'm glad I'm moving from this city but most of the rite aids are managed similarly.<//Text>

They’re lost  and walk like they have no interest in what they’re doing pretty rediculous and slow. And to top it off the phones are always busy you can call multiple times within the 40+ minutes that your waiting and still busy! So they don’t even want to hear it over the phone either!

Dropped off prescription advised it would be done by 1pm. Sat in my car for an hour in their filthy parking lot. Returned to the pharmacy, the clerk tries to give me another person's prescription with the same birth date, but not the same name. After giving the clerk my full name I'm told no one is picking up at the dentist off to get the date changed for the prescription fill date. I call my dentist and have no problem getting through. This location is a mess, not only is it filthy inside and outside but they are understaffed severely. Ridiculous< /Text>

<review>Yes wait time are always crazy and they are always behind! One of the Asian ladies can have a nasty attitude and throw stuff on the counter! They rarely answer their phones and drive thru is even longer wait than inside!

But they still eventually get my medication done! And no insurance issues!

Thinking of switching to Wal-Mart see how much better they are!

Update 9/2020: you guys really need to fix the pharmacy part of the Rite Aid app because I used to always submit my refill request through there and it always worked and now nothing works everything says duplicate entry now

I don't get texts no more and no notifications and nothing shows up anymore under prescriptions<//review>< user_id>

<review>This pharmacy is not capable of taking care of patients that need medication in a timely manner. This staff is friendly but overwhelmed and what is going on is even beyond the co trol of the pharmacy manager. When someone has a prescription and they are not supposed to miss a dose they will if their  medication is handled by this place. If you can't handle customer's needs do tbe ethical thing and turn them away and refer them somewhere else. It's not about money when it comes to a patient's care. The Rite Aid corporation doesn't care or else they would respond or even read their online reviews. How can you counsel someone on missing a dose of medicine when you are incapable of having medicine ready when promised. Pure Incompetence. Consumer beware!

Some employees are nice, others are super rude. I was put on hold by a woman who cut me off, after almost 15 minutes I thought they'd forgotten about me so I called back, it's now been twice that I've called and they don't even answer.</text>

Worst pharmacy..I'm not sure if they change their manager or something but their a total fail..everytime I go to pick up prescription for my kids their never ready..last time I went in there around 8:00pm ask for my prescription they tolled me it was a 2 a hour wait ..whatevers my son has really bad allergies so I waited in the car with my kids.went back in there after 2 ahours just for them to tell me they weren't gonna be ready until the day after!!are you kidding me I waited 2 ahours for this???
This is not the first time It happens that's why I'm doing this review..like please I know there super busy either hire more people or just close it down!!
No to mention I try calling about 20 times before walking in there but as always they never pick up the phone🤔..
It just to be a great pharmacy to get your prescription no enymore!!</review>

I have never been to a pharmacy that is as bad as this one. They never ever have my Perscription ready in a timely manner. I dropped off a new Perscription Sunday.  She asked if Monday would be ok to pick up. I said sure. Went there today ( Thursday ) and she said they have to order it. WTH!!!! Thank God I'm not out of my meds. Will be finding a new pharmacy asap!!!!<//Text>

I HAD A ROOT CANAL AND WALMART DIDN'T HAVE THE NORCO IN STOCK, AND MY REGULAR PHARMACY DOESN'T CARRY NORCO. THE BALD WHITE MAN AT RITE AID WOULDN'T FILL THE NORCO BECAUSE I HAD BEEN TO "SEVERAL DIFFERENT PHARMACIES" FOR NARCOTIC!! WHAT ELSE AM I SUPPOSED TO DO IF THEY NEVER HAVE IT IN STOCK.

THE REGULAR STORE EMPLOYEES ARE DECENT BUT THE PHARMACY IS SOOOOO RUDE AND JUDGEMENTAL. I GUESS HE THINKS I AM AN ADDICT RUNNING FROM RX TO RX WHEN THE REASON IS SIMPLY BECAUSE IF ONE IS OUT OF STOCK I GO TO ANOTHER, JUST LIKE I DO WHEN GROCERY SHOPPING. COME ON!</Text>

Called the pharmacy to call in a pain medication for a patient. The technician checked and said their was a tablet form of the medication needed. Then I waited on hold for 17 minutes. No one checked in. Then when he got on the line, turns out, the medication is in capsules.<//review>

If their drive-thru window isn't operational, they're 4 days behind in filling prescriptions. Spoke with Managers who could care less that I'm transferring my prescriptions. Also, they accidently gave my Uncle the OPPOSITE blood pressure medication, which he took for a week before they called him regarding the mistake.< /text>

The prices of fuel are comparable to the other stations around the area.  Their car wash is both good and bad.  I live in an apartment, and can't wash my car in the conventional way.  I like that it's a touch-less wash (they use pressurized water).  This let me at least knock enough of the heavy dirt and dust off of my car so I could go home and use a water-less wash.  The wash does take a long time, though, so I would skip it if there was a line.< /text>

Despite what the Android Pay app says, this gas station doesn't take Android Pay. They also don't take the chip card, so take care before swiping.<//Text>

What a lovely day! Amazing for animal lovers, with very informative farm tour available FREE on Saturdays and Sundays at 11am. Our 1 year old loved it and we were really impressed with the quality of life the animals have. We we definitely be signing up for the kids camps and the meat box!</text>

<Review>Great working farm to visit and walk around. Beautiful hills and small hidden lake.  Also has a store that sells farm products.  We brought our leashed dog and she loved it! Will definitely be back.< /Review>< GmapID>

Free tours at 11am on saturdays and sundays. The store has fresh eggs and pasture raised meat. If you are a farm member you can walk around for free anytime or go catch and release fishing in the lake.</text>

A wonderful farm created from the awareness that farm animals deserve to live good lives, with dignity - in the open air, under the sun, eating healthy foods - before being slaughtered. Even as a vegetarian, I'm totally in alignment with this philosophy. They offer farm tours at noon on Saturdays and Sundays - a great experience for the kids, and for anyone who wants to know where meat comes from, and to see animals living good, signifies lives.</text>

<Name>Just Another Day<//Name>< review>
We were hoping to see more than what we were able to see. We had a chance to see the pigs, ducks and event area but that’s it. There was nobody in the office when we got there and we asked a staff member outside but he seemed like he didnt know what to tell us. He politely handed us what seemed to be a map but didnt really do much for us. wish they have been more specific and helpful as to where to go or which direction to take as we were just trying to do a self guided tour.< /review>

Pasture Raised meats and local goods for sale or delivery! One of the few farms to offer guilded tours. Lots of cute animals and educational opportunities. Great for families, schools, or groups looking for a fun way to spend the weekend.<//text>

Tara Firma is the place for grass fed animal protein and organic produce. You can buy at their store--or better yet, get a weekly order of goodies that you can pick up at various locations in Petaluma and other nearby towns. They've got a special way of drying/aging their grass-fed beef that gives it really good flavour.<//Text>

<review>Anchored by a large Safeway. Convenient to I680 at Santa Rita. Layout of store fits Safeway's overall pattern. Convenient rest room location. Deli serves individual servings allowing the locals to grab a quick bite. Produce and meat section all look fresh. Flower section done in a good selection of color.</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtwWofEfEkr8j_zV-9fx_wxw1QwrqETdhc2w=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOkEX2gCAj3caQmE8TFJTjaPZ0wFd8IVGVDWg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqQU5-owQF09wdiuToaVeqsMOvBORZs-hZlA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvTDzLCrjUQCKp7BF4aSY8UJ1i5lo9kr2hiA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOoF_LvC40Z6oaBM6MBXQPz0_-X1xhhuw1Ljg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEab7qUfbpXqj31d_en3sCGi2LRJJG71XFzw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtFy4qd0vzytdsA0YGGnC4fb3XEsdnz4_E5A=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8iV3wqeNkd8glifryoghNONtTn6RAsvjnRQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< resp>

These shops have everything you could possibly want. The produce here is exquisite. The fresh vegetables are truly fresh, and the canned produce isn't half bad. My only issue is finding staff. In all of these stores, I have trouble finding employees.<//Review>

They do have a wide variety of Asian products and have essentials that I am not able to find anywhere else. However the store reeks of seafood and the hygiene of the meat area is questionable. I stick to prepackaged foods at this location.<//Review>

<Review>A decent housing/shopping plaza anchored by Safeway.   Has a number of decent restaurants like Amicis pizza, Coco Cabana, Blush yogurt, a sushi place plus some quick places like Pete's coffee, Baja Fresh.  Also some services like hair cuts, shipping, Salon.  Parking is never full.</Review>< pictures>

The variety and quality of stores here are fine. There is no public restroom provided by the center. The infrastructure if the lot is inadequate and poorly designed. It's inconvenient to get in and out of the lot. The plants and buildings seem well maintained. It's just not spectacular or competitive with more upscale or modern shopping centers.<//text>

Waterford Shopping Center has a great mix of businesses.

Anchored by Safeway and Wells Fargo a few of my favorite shops here are Armadillo Willy’s, Bagel Street Cafe, PostalAnnex, and Peet’s Coffee.

This center also has salons, dental offices, a martial arts studio, AAA, Unleashed by Petco, and GNC to name a few more.

This parking lot can be a mess at times but still my go to shopping center.< /text>

I liked the area but parking could be an issue depending on time of day since there are lots of different store in the area including Blush frozen yogurt, Armadillo Willys,  Safeway, Amicis, etc. But I liked the convenient of the plaza - I can shop grocery after I eat 👍< /Text>

Their is no Tesla nor Bolt or EV stations anywhere, not even underground parking at all.
A lot is here, 1st of all a newer great Safeway with O Organics, mom to mom and other great brands including most international foods. Could do better than just basmati rice for Indian food. A lot off guarenteed Produce including unusual fruits. Cold waters and some single beers and small batch brewers.  Peets' coffee a dentist a pet store where you can wash you small or large doggie. Or cat!

Two hair cutters for guys including great clips.
Salon including tanning(?). Not safe for folks did eptable to u v rays overexposure according to the FDA AND the National Safety Council and IHHS. Karate school, BBQ. Sushi, organic yogurt(frozen), Asian specialty and several dentists and even a massage place that is not shady. Expensive membership though, in most opinionated.  Banks, apartment community that was built by Shea over  decade ago almost two.
It is truly an integral part of the shopped and across from a mediterrian and Mexican style cafe and optometrist.  Some qualitative and some quantitative items/businesses. Here is a lot of one stop shopping and a large city water park and city park behind in Emerald Glen.
If living or coming from Tracy worth a stop. Miles from fuel stop though. Across freeway is a it's and a Shell. Waterford is busy even with an CSAA/AAA branch office too. Decent place.<//text>

<Review>I'm not giving this a 5-star review until a real Café comes in with tea and coffee and farm-to-fork sandwiches & soups and a bakery and Wi-Fi and random music and loaner books spread about and, just, overall character. For additional reference, check out Blackbird Café in Valparaiso, IN. Local proprietor. No chain. Total soul.< /Review>< Pics>
