I just started with new generation and am very impressed. Got a very thorough pre examination and needed a deep cleaning. I've gone over a year since my last check up. Thanks to covid and my previous dentist closing. Very professional, clean, advanced equipment and very talented and caring staff. 5 stars!<//Review>

This is the first time I have ever found a dentist that makes the experience easy. Hannah at the front desk was very professional, Jocelyn was very careful and professional with the X-rays, the process was so smooth and easy. The cleaning by Antoinette and Ximena was seamless, they fixed my gums that were in bad shape and my teeth are cleaner and better than ever - everyone here just so nice and so professional. I am delighted with this place. Highly recommended for anyone that’s looking for a dentist in this neighborhood.

You will love this dentist! They take the time and care necessary to make you feel comfortable and they don’t push unnecessary things on you like other dentists. I completely trust them not only with me, but my whole family.<//Text>

<date>1611785166988<//date><rating>5</rating><Review>Today I took my 3y old twins to see Dr. Sara and her team for 6 months check up. I’ve been coming to their office since my kids were 1yo. Today my daughter that is very attached to me, allowed Dr. Sara to explain to her the dentist tools and let her have one of her tools to play in her doll. After a few minutes she was ready to sit on the dentist chair on her own, put headsets and have Dr. Sara inspect her teeth follow by her colleague for cleaning. My son was always easy going and had a blast watching cars while the exam and cleaning was done. I never thought in a million years my two 3y olds would actually have FUN at the dentist. To all New Generation Dentistry my thank you. You all make it happen and deliver beyond amazing service and CARE for my family!<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>I highly recommend New Generation Dentistry for adults and children.  From the moment you walk in, you receive the best customer service and hospitality at front desk, with the technicians and the dentist.  I was really impressed with the 3D cone beam imaging.  It captures areas of teeth, the roots, bone, joints, sinuses, and airway. Dr. Sasha took his time to explain  my scans and he was able to determine that based on my wisdom teeth roots, and distance between wisdom to other teeth, I didn’t need to take out my wisdom teeth, Yay!

My 10 year old son had to get his first cavities filled and was EXTREMELY nervous.  The pediatric dentist, Dr. Sara, explained in detail the process to my son.  Showing him each tool that was going to be used and letting him touch them to see that they don’t hurt.  She waited until he was completely comfortable and ready for her to begin.  They put on his favorite show on Netflix and he was ready to go.  Her patience and kindness just warmed my heart. She was also able to get a few cavities filled in one visit in a short amount of time.  Double Yay!!

In short, my son and I both had a great experience and they are amazing!  Oh, did I mention that my husband goes there, too?  He’s the one that found them and I’m very grateful.</Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

They have a genuine “Be our guest” kind of attitude from Beauty and the Beast. It was my first day here because my mom told me I NEED TO MAKE A DENTIST APPOINTMENT, so I thought it would just be like any other dentist appointment, but NO it was amazing! I came in with them knowing my name waiting for me, given a welcoming tour of every room and everything they use, and a card waiting for me with my name on it and a blanket they give to all their new patients. Unreal, I was amazed by this place. Everything is brand new and luxurious, and have the most genuine amazing people working here. I’m stoked that this is the place my insurance designates!! I’m so happy, best Dentistry ever!!<//Review><gmap_id>0x80dce9895d754967:0x6c55ab388603845<//gmap_id>< Pictures>

Love this place. Excellent customer service and amazing dentist. Dr. Sasha is truly the best dentist. He uses all the new technology and devices and is great about explaining his plan and procedures. He did my implant and I am just so glad I found him. His staff are always friendly and on top of everything—they are really top notch.</review>

<Date>1602560395583< /Date><response>None</response><Review>I brought my son to see Dr. Sara Khoshbin. I must admit, my son’s apprehension towards dentists is beyond anything I can describe. I know that because I have tried other dentists and no one could get near him. Dr. Sara was unbelievable. She truly has a special way of doing dental work on difficult children like my son. The procedure was completely painless for him and he sat through the entire procedure, no crying , no fussing. New Generation dentistry has the state of the art cutting edge technology.  Dr. Sara’s gentle  manners, experience and  knowledge made the appointment extremely comfortable.
Thank you to Dr. Sara, Dr. Sasha Mohib and the entire Team at New Generation Dentistry.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Time>1599698211084</Time><rate>1<//rate><review>Not Covid compliant. Yes they take temperatures but they do not enforce wearing masks in the office. They do not separate patients in the waiting room. They do not put protective separators or plastic sheeting between work stations. Basically they protect themselves wearing both masks and shields while they work on patients but leave the patients completely vulnerable to each other. Each work station is a mere foot to two feet away from the next work station. They allow patients to walk around without masks claiming that they had just had their teeth cleaned. Can Covid 19 suddenly  be “cleaned” from peoples mouths? Seriously consider your safety and the safety of your children before bringing them to New Generation Dentistry during a pandemic.<//review>< pictures>

This is a great office! Everyone's so nice & helpful. They always make sure I understand what's going on & welcome any questions I may have. During my first visit, they asked my preference for giving me details about what's going on with my teeth (If I'm the type who can handle the straightforward  details, or if I prefer to be given only necessary info as to not freak me out). They're accommodating to nerves. They have stress balls, tvs & other neat stuff, although I've never needed those. I highly recommend them.<//Review>

Every member of staff that I spoke with was incredibly kind and professional. Specifically: Lara, Lindy, and Dr. Sasha. I was blown away the cleanliness and hospitality of this office, and at no point was I ever put in an uncomfortable position while getting my teeth cleaned. I cannot recommend a better practice than this one. Again, a huge thank you to Lara, Lindy, and Dr. Sasha for this fantastic experience. See you all again in 6 months!<//Review>< Gmap_id>

My wife and I have had a hard time finding dentists we could trust. Unfortunately, my wife and I have had bad experiences with 4 dentists in the area. This consisted of being told we needed procedures that were not needed, inaccurate billing , to unfriendly staff. Here,  my whole family and myself had an awesome experience. The staff was super friendly and extremely professional. The services provided were well done. No attempts were made to sell procedures that were not necessary. Thank you New Generation Dentistry for you honesty, great service and professionalism. Most important, thank you for taking great care of my family.

P.S.
Thank you for the great referrals.< /review>

I told my friend I was going to my dentist today and she replied poor you. I said you don’t understand I like going to my dentist the are all so nice and very caring people.  And today they were so careful with all of them having me sanitize my hands etc, and they were wearing heavy duty masks and constantly sanitizing everything they touched.</text>

Every step of the way through a couple exams and a cleaning they were very informative about all details, easy to understand.  The best part is that I wasn’t waiting around for anything the whole time I was consistently getting worked on so even though it was a pretty decent amount of work I was still done in a decent amount of time it wasn’t that long considering.  This is definitely a good dentistry.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>I’m so glad I was referred to New Generation Dentistry. I made an emergency appointment for a broken tooth and I was able to get an appointment on the same day! Dr Sasha helped me to understand my options and took his time to explain all the details. I really appreciate his generous nature and helping me with making the best decision. I’m so happy that I found New Generation Dentistry!<//Text>< pictures>

<review>Our three children are regular patients at New Generation Dentistry and from the minute we walk into the door they are met with welcoming smiles and warmth! The staff are very professional and quick  at making sure we are taken care of and directed to the waiting room. The waiting room is inviting with games and storybooks for the kids, cell phone chargers, mini fridge stocked with water and coffee. Dr SARA takes the time to discuss and comfort us and our children making sure there in no anxiety. The cleanliness of clinic is always top notch  and we couldn’t have had a better experience anywhere else! Our youngest one has had such a positive experience at New Generation, he jumps when he knows he has a dentists appointment!</review><Date>1543509819567</Date>< resp>

I've been a patient of Dr. Sasha at New Generation Dentistry for 4+ years now. Every visit is always pleasant with him and his entire staff. They are consistent on being patient and accommodating. Very professional. Olga, who is a new staff employee of New Generation Dentistry, performed my cleaning during my last visit was very friendly, detail-oriented and professional. I recommend this place especially when I do not live locally or in the vicinity of Orange County but its close enough to work to stick with New Generation Dentistry.</Text>

Both my children, 5 year daughter and 2 year old son, love getting their teeth checked and cleaned at New Generation Dentistry. Dr. Sara and staff are always warm and friendly. They have a great understanding of children and speak to them in a clear and positive manner. Office space is very clean and well kept. Design style is very kid friendly and fun.<//Text>

I had to have a tooth pulled today. I was over the top anxious but was immediately put to ease when I walked in. By the time I left, I felt no pain. I had no recollection of the extraction. The staff was very professional and warm. I have upmost confidence in that dentist.<//review>< user_name>

Got a thumbs up this visit from my great dentist Dr. Sasha and my hygienist Karla.  They have been doing a great job keeping on me to be more aggressive with my home care and giving great tips -- it is now paying off.  Was really glad to get a good grade today.  This practice is tops as is the customer service -- from the front desk to the chair!  And by the way, whoever did the interior design of the office -- hats off again.  It feels more like a palace than a dentist office.  They even have Perrier sparkling water in their fridge if you are thirsty!< /review>

As always, the warmth of the staff at New Generations puts me instantly at ease. Within 5 minutes of sitting in the chair the cleanliness, professionalism and use of cutting edge technology that the dentist/assistant employ lets me know I’m in good hands. No matter what condition I walk through the door in the team at New Generations always ensure I leave smiling!< /review>

<Review>This was honestly the best dentist  visit I’ve had in my life and I am 35 years old and have seen plenty of Dentist  before.     I arrived as a new patient they gave me a tour of the office everything looks brand new and up-to-date took x-rays and a 3-D image so we can see all the problems in my mouth, I had to get a wisdom tooth removed I was expecting to be in a lot of pain but it was the first time in my life that I did not feel the Novacaine shot and did not feel anything in the procedure. Truly amazing work Dr.Sasha!  Finally found a dentist I can comfortably go back to.  Everyone in the office has a positive attitude and very welcoming. Thank you!!!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

<text>Dr. Sara has the magic touch!  Both of my kids (5 & 2) who were previously scared of the dentist, had exams, cleaning and xrays with no fear or tears!  The office is very clean and nicely remodeled, with lots of perks for the kids, such as ceiling mounted TVs, several flavors of toothpaste and fluoride, and balloons and a treasure chest when they're finished.  All of the staff was extremely friendly and attentive as well.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Everybody was friendly and courteous. My appointment started right on time. I was there for a regular cleaning, x rays and exam. Raquel the hygienist was great, explaining everything clearly. She was friendly and professional. When the Dr. came in he also was friendly and professional. Everybody seemed quite competent, and overall the visit went well.< /review>

<Review>Hands down, the best dental experience  I have ever had. This office is state of the art, with new machines and modern technologies. They have headphones for their patient to wear and watch Netflix while getting your teeth clean or doing treatment.
The entire staff was amazing, knowledgeable, friendly and welcoming. Dr. Sasha was extremely  thorough with my exam.
My hygienist Lindy did a great job cleaning my teeth. She was very thorough and gentle.
They also have a separate area for kids to get their exam and teeth cleaning. For sure I will be bringing my kids here to see Dr. Sara as well.
I’m excited to have found this office and will definitely refer all my family and friends to New Generation Dentistry.

Update 9/4/20 - Came in for cleaning/check up because Dr. Sasha and the team have successfully made this fearful patient a dental convert. More importantly, they took extensive measures to ensure patient and personnel safety during COVID. They even gave me my own pen/stylus (to keep) to complete the checkin forms, and disposable ear covers for headphones. As always, I was provided with eye protection and the hygienist was wearing more PPE than usual. I felt safe. I truly adore the kindness and professionalism from the front desk and hygienist and as always, Dr. Sasha is great.

Previous review:
As the quintessential fearful patient, I've admittedly dreaded dentists since childhood. For the first time in years I've found a dental practice I won't quit. From the warm and professional front desk team to the hygienist (love Raquel) to Dr. Sasha, I'm a fan. And again, I hate going to the dentist, but NGD has created a relaxing environment. They listen and truly care about long term dental health. They answer any questions and have solutions for my concerns. They don't try to sell me anything and they stand by their work. They don't make me feel weird for being a grown mom whose kids are braver than she is at the dentist. And their hours are convenient for a busy working mom. My husband is also going here routinely, which is a miracle in itself. When he started and continued with NGD, I gave them a chance and I'm glad I did. My sincere thanks to the NGD team.<//text>

<text>I LOVE THESE GUYS!!! Every visit has been amazing! Today I went in to get all my old fillings replaced and had Dr. Sasha. He got me in and out and did an incredible job! I was there from 8:30-11 and eating lunch by 12! I got a warm blankie, pillow and watched Netflix the whole time! Laura the new girl is a sweetheart and my girl Gabi at the front always takes care of me. If you are looking for a dentist in Orange County look no further. I would add more stars to this review if I could. <3<//text>< Time>

Took my daughter here for her dental check up because the last place we went for her had horrible service . I can say here they treat you family. Very welcoming from when you walk in. Dr. Sara was very gentle and caring that my daughter felt comfortable the whole exam and cleaning . My daughter even ask if we will be going here from now on because she doesn’t want to go anywhere else because she likes Dr. Sara . Hence we live about an hour away but I will make that travel because it was worth it. Bring your kids here if you are looking for a great kids dentist.<//Text>

<Text>I’ve been to many dentists in my life.  Dentists in Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, and Virginia.  Unfortunately I visit the dentist quite often.  This dentist is by far the best I’ve ever been to.  It is clean, they have up to date technology, the staff is extemely friendly, they have the best customer service... I could go on. Dr. Sasha is so attentive and genuinely cares about your dental health.  Dr. Sasha and his team do everything to make you feel comfortable, literally! They offer you blankets and drinks. He will explain everything he is doing, why he is doing it and in a way you can understand. He education is from one of the best dental schools in the country (USC). I’ve
had the best experience here!</Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Review>Dr. Sara and her team are beyond amazing. I know usually kids don't like the dentist but my kids (ages 5 and 8) actually look forward to it.  The doctor is very good with kids and will explain everything to parents and really has the best interest of the kids at heart. I love this place and happy I found the best dentist for the whole family!!< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>I have been going to new generation dentistry for several years, I could not be more happy with the work I’ve had done. I constantly receive complements on what lovely teeth I have. Thanks to them. The first time my cleaning was done the I was amazed they spent 3 times longer than my previous dentists had ever done. Also every staff member is delightful and I actually look forward to going to my appointments. My son is also a patient and the work they have done on him is outstanding.</Review>< Pics>

Words cannot describe my gratitude to Dr. Sera and the entire team at New Generation Dentistry. We discovered 6 cavities in my stubborn 5 year old son’s teeth. Having an oral surgeon and a periodontist as his parents, it was not acceptable nor believable that our child had so many dental issues. So we immediately contacted New Generation Dentistry. Dr. Sera got our son in quickly and examined him. The office was equipped with special kids friendly technology which made taking X-ray on a 5 year old very easy. She confirmed that our son had deep cavities and needed root canals and fillings. Since the work he needed was extensive, Dr. Sara arranged to perform all the dental work under anesthesia. She is hospital trained and very comfortable performing procedures on little kids under anesthesia. That was very comforting and important for us. After all any parent would be apprehensive about putting their child under anesthesia. Dr. Sara performed all the dental work our son needed in one visit. It was the most pleasant dental experience our child could have had. The night of the procedure Dr. Sara called to check on our son. She also spend time teaching and encouraging my son proper oral hygiene and in brushing. We greatly appreciate and highly recommend Dr. Sara and the entire team at New Generation Dentistry.<//Text>

<Text>I have been to quite a few dentists in my life. These guys are truly the best. The dentist Ahmad himself is a terrific guy and very accommodating. His staff is also terrific, they should teach customer service classes.

You feel extremely comfortable for being in a dentist’s office.

My dental hygienist Antonette is absolutely terrific also. She puts you at comfort, does a great job and is generally very nice when she is working with your teeth

Great place for dental work!!</Text>< pictures>

<Text>Dr. Sasha and his staff are extremely professional, thorough, and honest. I have had some unfavorable experiences with other dentists in the past, but Dr. Sasha is meticulous and makes sure that his dental work is of the upmost quality. I would highly recommend his and his practice to my friends and family. If you want a dentist you can trust and who’s work is second to none, Dr. Sasha is your man. Thank you doctor for always taking great care of me and my teeth!<//Text></record>

<text>The entire Team at New Generation Dentistry is one of the friendliest group of professionals I’ve ever met. From the minute you walk in the door, even as a new patient, you feel the sincerity in their efforts to make you feel comfortable and valued. Receptionist Melissa greats you with a wonderful smile and gets you started in the process. They are proud of their very modern, flawless facility and encourage you to ask questions as they take you on a tour. Dental Assistant Stephanie, with her high energy positive attitude, provides expert explanations about the work she is providing and how the results are used in the next phase of their process. I had the pleasure of working with Dr. Sasha who brought me to his office to explain in detail what was leaned from the information Stephanie gathered. Dr. Sasha was extremely patient and truly interested in hearing about the expectations I had for my visit as well as any general concerns or question I had. After a thorough exam by Dr. Sasha I was introduced to one of his  Dental Hygienist. I had the honor of working with Dental Hygienist Antoinette who took great care in painlessly cleaning my teeth and respectfully explaining how to improve on caring for my teeth between visits. Through my entire visit I was never rushed or made to feel I was imposing when asking questions. On a scale of 1-10, I give the Team at New Generation Dentistry an 11.</text>< pics>

My son had a horrible tooth ache after he bit into something wrong. He was in so much pain that he couldn't eat. Next day, my husband called the office to see if he could get in to for him to be seen. They scheduled him immediately and found that his baby tooth was being pushed by his adult tooth and the pain would subside after the tooth fell out. Since he was in so much pain, we decided to have Dr. Sasha pull his tooth out. He did such an amazing job and our son's pain was instantaneously gone after the procedure was done. An hour after the tooth was pulled our son was back at school with no pain! Thank you to the team at New Generation Dentistry for taking such great care of my family!

My family and I just love New Generation Dentistry!  My son sees Dr. Sara.  She is a wonderful pediatric dentist who is caring, kind and gentle!  She educates the kids on proper techniques for oral care and takes the time with each patient to make sure they understand her lesson.

My husband and I both see Dr. Sasha.  He is a wonderful adult dentist who is caring, kind and gentle!  He is extremely thorough and makes she that you are doing everything necessary to keep your teeth and keep them healthy!

Anita is the first person you see when you walk in and she ALWAYS greets you with a smile.  You can tell that she loves where she works because she always answers the phone with a smile too!!!

New Generation Dentistry is a top notch, high tech, well managed dental practice for people of all ages!

What are you waiting for??? Go see the dentists at New Generation Dentistry!!!< /Text>

<review>Recently moved to the area.  I came here for a consultation.  Dr. Sansa and Gabi are very friendly and helpful calming me down about all my concerns (clenching, cracked teeth, crowns, root canals, hidden extra tooth, possible implant requirements).  The office is very modern. On my first visit I received an office tour.  If you're reading this you should just go in and at least check it out.  They understand if you have any anxiety.  Just bring it up.  I'll be going here for all my future needs.</review>< Pics>

New Generation Dentistry is awesome!!! It’s the dental office that for me offers  the best in terms of the technology they use and the competence of the staff.

The technology allows them to create crowns in-house while you wait. No more waiting for days to get the permanent crowns done.

Office environment is made very pleasant by the friendliness and excellent customer service by their staff led by Anita.

I had my prophylaxis done today by Gisselle. She was very thorough and explained any additional care I needed to avoid getting problems in the future.

Dr. Sasha is the MVP that makes sure the machine is well oiled and working flawlessly. He uses current technology that benefits his patients. He has excellent bedside manners and explains the procedure very clearly and makes sure the patient understands everything.

I recommend New Generation Dentistry for all your dental needs.</Text>

This office is great! The staff really went out of their way to make me feel comfortable when I came in to my first appointment with some nerves. They were very clear with what work I would need to have done and didn't try to upsell anything. The office is equipped with so much modern technology - they even take images of your entire skull to go over with you. Oh, and they also have Netflix in the chairs with noise cancelling headphones which went a long way in calming my nerves. Overall I'm super happy I found an office I feel comfortable at (a tough feat for me).</Review>

The staff is completely professional, knowledgeable and they always take me on time for my appointments.  Dr. Sasha is completely trustworthy and Anita and staff treat you like family.  I wouldn't trust anyone else to take care of my dental needs.</Review>< Name>

<review>Dr. Sasha is a true professional and by far the best dentist I've found in SoCal!  My family and I have visited many of the more expensive offices around over the years and none compare to the passion, expertise and skill level of Dr. Sasha and his team of professionals.  Even after a minor only a minor filling in my tooth, Dr. Sasha personally called me later that day to inquire how I was doing!  He's passionate about his work, cares about his patients and is years ahead of the other "modern" dentistry locations regarding technology.  Great place, great people, excellent work!<//review>< pics>

Have been going to the same Dentist in Irvine for the past 35 years. He finally retired and I had to find another. Was very happy to have found NGD! I feel after seeing their facility and experiencing their service that I was previously living in the dark ages of dentistry. I would be shocked to hear of anyone having a bad experience here. You won’t be disappointed, their equipment and staff are unmatched!</review>

Another pleasant dental appointment for me! I have been well cared by NGD for over five years by various staffs and their services were always highly courteous and professional. Dr. Sasha is very wonderful in watching and treating of my dental health issues. To be known, his soft touch is sweet to your teeth. At my older age I am grateful for NGD care and services.  The office is modern and pleasing to be in. Specifically in this Covid time, the waiting area is spacious, tidying clean and bright. The dental staff promotes proper masking and advanced health procedures.
Parking is plenty and easy at all times.  Always an enjoying experience for me both coming and going.</Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I took my 2 year old daughter for her very first dentist appointment and it went fantastic! She was SO excited to hold the balloon the whole time and even got a little container of play dough at the end (which she's still completely obsessed with). I also went for my appointment the same day and while they didn't give me a balloon (darn), they did a very thorough job. I was a little confused by the billing since I received something from my insurance that says I still owe $590 but my husband contacted them saying that they just have to bill the insurance for those procedures and that they're covered since we're all new clients. As long as that stays true, I would have to say my experience was phenomenal. I came from a dentist that never went over pricing, I was constantly in pain, and had no bedside manner. It was the complete opposite here and we're so happy to find a dentist the whole family can go to.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

<Review>I can only say wonderful, positive things about this place.  My 2 youngest daughters who are now 3 and 5 started coming here over a year and a half ago, and they love their dentist.  Dr. Sara is sweet, soft spoken and fast when it comes to sealants, etc, so the little ones get in and out happily.  Their waiting room is fun, with toys and Nintendo games, and they give the kids headphones and have televisions with cartoons that they can watch straight above their heads to keep them distracted.  And they also have an awesome treasure box.  The whole staff is wonderful and accommodating, and I highly recommend this practice!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

It doesn’t get better than this.  The are fast, friendly, efficient and most of all they don’t try and sell you.  Dr Sasha is the nicest guy you ever want to meet!  I cannot recommend them enough.

If you go, you will say the same thing.  I rarely leave reviews but in this case I cannot help myself!  My brother turned me on to Dr. Sasha.  He said the same things I am writing here.  My entire family now goes to NGD.  We can’t be happier!

BYW,  All the Equipment is the new and high tech.

I have been going to New Generation for 4 years now and still love the experience there. Dr. Sasha and Dr. Sara are a great team, and the staff always do a great job too. The office was well-managed and pleasant to be in, they took a lot of time decorating it, and it shows by how beautiful it looks. The doctor and dental hygienist had a nice, gentle touch when cleaning my teeth. They deserve at least 10 stars!</text>

Everything from the moment you arrive is wonderful at New Generation Dentistry! They took us early for our appointment. The waiting area is clean and beautiful. So much for kids of all ages to do while waiting. There is coffee of all flavors and bottled water in a mini fridge for adults. The dentists and dental hygienist are all sooooo good with kids. My little one is only 18 months and they work with her to get through the appointment. They are so patient! They review everything in detail and really catered to our needs as my daughter has special medical restrictions. Afterward they took her to get a balloon and go in the treasure chest for a toy! They had a goodie bag with a flyer for Mom to read and all sorts of good stuff for the kids. It’s the best dentist ever!!!!<//Text>

I switched to New Generation hoping my experience would be much better than my last dentist and they exceeded my expectations I have never felt more comfortable going to the Dentist and not feeling like they are trying to upsell me this huge dental plan at the end of my visit on things I don't need done to my mouth. They are all about the health of your teeth not the amount they can pull out of your pocket. I also got the best cleaning I have had in my entire life from their office, Thanks Ellie! I'll be going back to get my one cavity they found after three years of dodging the dentist and my cleaning in 4 months!< /Text>

I have been coming here for a few years now, and I have to say that they are the nicest most accommodating dental practice that I have ever been to. Very knowledgeable and I have so far been very satisfied with my experiences there. I would highly recommend to anyone.</Text>

<Review>I had a completely satisfactory experience at the New Generation Dentistry. All the staff, and specifically Dr. Sasha himself, were very friendly, welcoming, and accommodating, as well as being strictly professional about their services.
The office is very clean, and has a comforting ambiance. I don't have a kid but the waiting area has definitely been designed with families in mind. There wasn't any waiting for my turn and the place seemed to run smoothly.
I was completely happy with the service too, which is why I was there in the first place. Dr. Sasha was very thorough and also very calm and understanding. For someone like me who finds it extremely uncomfortable at a dentistry (and I don't think I'm the only one) he made the experience a lot easier.
It's been a couple of weeks now that I have done a crown at this place and I couldn't be more satisfied with the service and the surrounding details.
Oh, last but not least, the fees are also very fare. All in all, I think I have found my dentist at last and I would definitely recommend this place.</Review>< Rating>

They have a very nice office and high-tech equipment, but the amazing staff is what makes it worth driving the extra miles.

<Text>I had a great experience. I went in for my first appointment and was very impressed. The office is very modern with a very comfortable feel. We have been looking for a dentist for a long time and I think we finally found it!

Technology is widely utilized at the New Generation office from the 3D scan of your mouth and subsequent "tour" Dr. Sasha gives in his office to the TV on the ceilings to keep you occupied during your cleaning if you wish to the electronic sign-in process.

Most importantly though, the staff is very friendly. I have found customer service lacking in the past 3 dentists we visited, but New Generation has it from the moment you walk in to the moment you walk out the door. I highly recommend them if you are looking for a dentist to take care of your smile.<//Text>< Pics>

I'm so thankful that I went to New Generation Dentistry and I chose Dr. Sasha Moheb as my dentist. At my initial consultation, I was greeted by their very friendly receptionist and Dr. Sasha as well. I hardly waited for the service.  After filling out the new patients forms, I went in right away to do the examination part.  I really appreciated  how Dr.Sasha took his time to explain to me in details why I would need certain procedures. At my first procedure, I had to bare a minimum pain (could hardly feel any pain!), since he used numbing gel. He was super careful and constantly asked if I had any pain. Dr.Sasha took his time and did a great job on my teeth.
One thing I forgot to mention is, how modern and nice the office looks. Their fees were very reasonable and they have a great payment plan. Do not hesitate to go to New Generation Dentistry! You’ll be very happy to do so!</text>

Over the last couple of years, I've been to a few dentists and can say that Dr. Sasha is a cut above the rest. He is kindly and he caring. He takes the time to explain and makes sure you're comfortable. I highly recommend him.   Dental assistants and office staff go above and beyond to ensure a pleasurable experience.<//text>

<Review>As always, the staff at NGD are absolutely impeccable. My 3 year old son came in for his second appointment today and was not at all nervous due to the extremely smooth visit we had six months ago. In fact he was so excited to visit the dentist and was in no hurry to leave! Dr. Sara put my son at ease right from the start and her friendly and patient demeanor was very calming for him. She did not push him beyond his comfort level and he was even able to watch a video whilst she worked on his teeth. The dental assistant was also superb and very helpful, and Anita at the front desk is exceptionally gracious and hospitable. The whole experience was great and appointment was very thorough and detailed. We look forward to our next visit.< /Review></record>

< review>
I had my first visit at New Generation dentistry today and I couldn't be happier with the choice. I have a 1 year old son and he is very mobile:) The office staff greeted him with such kindness and even offered to spend time with him while I had x-rays taken. He was very happy in their care and that means the world to me. I am looking forward to the cleaning I have scheduled as Dr. Sasha uses the most up to date technology there is out there ( I know because a good friend works for Patterson Dental). Their office is impecably clean and they take every possible measure to use sterile equipment. Appointments are easy to schedule and the staff is very pleasant; you can tell they really love working there. I would highly recommend New Generation Dentistry!</review>

<Text>My husband and I just moved to the area and I’m pretty picky about choosing the right dentist for us. With that said, I’m confident to say that we chose perfectly with New Generation Dentistry. They have all the latest technology and tools (including the full head & jaw x-ray machine), friendly staff, beautiful office, creature comforts like watching TV/Netflix while you get your teeth cleaned and MOST IMPORTANTLY, fair and affordable prices. We got several quotes for the work needed done on my husband’s teeth and Dr. Sasha gave us his honest opinion and didn’t try to upsell us. We highly recommend you give them a try!< /Text>< pics>

EXTREMELY friendly and professional staff, state-of-the-art equipment...I told them I never want to leave!
In general, people are "fearful" of going to the dentist. No fear here!! I highly, highly recommend them! Oh, and I never write reviews; only when something is exceptional or downright horrible I share my experience.. NGD is exceptional!< /review></record>

<Text>No fears or tears !
Finding the best pediatric dentist is a challenge.We all want what's best for our kids,right ?
We drive 1 hour and pass many dentist just to have Dr.Sara taking care of our kids.She truly cares about her patients as if they are her own kids.Being very personable and genuine,she earned their trust .Getting work done is painless ! She knows how to talk to them,distracts them,explains step by step what she is doing and motivated them to have good brushing and flossing habits.Every chair has a tv.,the waiting room has games and kids leave with little toys and ballons.
Our kids have had such a great experience every single time.
New Generation Dentistry exceeded all our expectations !What a great team, from the front desk, hygienists,doctors,everyone is so friendly and takes great pride in their work.< /Text>< Pictures>

Dr. Sasha repaired a broken tooth with a root cannel and crown for 1/3 the price I paid historically with the same insurance.  Additionally his scan of my mouth found the reason why I was having constant sinus infections from a molar root protruding into the cavity.  He cost of fixing the two issues was well below the cost I typically paid for a crown on one tooth. Moreover all of it was done in 2 hours with an appointed schedule a day from my first call.  His staff is very professional and easy to work with.< /review>< Pics>

<review>New Generation Dentistry is the best dentistry I have visited.  Dr. Sasha is outstanding. He is very meticulous and detail oriented in his work.  For two years I had an ear and tongue pain and had been to numerous ENTs, but they could not figure it out.  Finally, Dr. Sasha found out that I had a tooth infection, and treat me.  I  am so delighted to finally find a dentist that I could trust.  Also, his staff is very friendly and professional and make everyone feel comfortable.</review></record></dataset><record>

I loved how they treated my son, kuddos for that.  Time is money,  having said that I was not pleased to have waited 40 minutes when our appt. was scheduled at 5:00 pm, not 5:40 pm... I hope this doesn't happen again or I will go find someone else.< /text>

<review>I recently moved to Mission Viejo, and needed to find a trustworthy dentist (we all know how difficult that can be).  My work background is dental management, so I was looking for professionalism, hospital-standard cleanliness, clinical excellence, and 5 star customer service.  I contacted a friend who is a leading professor at USC’s Dental School, Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry of USC and he immediately recommended a past student of his, now a practicing dentist.  So on his recommendation, I made an appointment.  To make a long story short, Dr. Sasha and his dental office, New Generation Dentistry, is by far one of the most impressive dental offices I’ve encountered…and I’ve worked with dozens.  The facility in general (and the operatories in particular) are absolutely immaculate.  The staff were all terrific, and they made my time there very positive.  Dr. Sasha approached me and we had a short but pleasant conversation regarding dentistry and what it was I was looking for.  I continued with the necessary digital x-rays, followed by an honest and straightforward diagnosis, which he did with understandable detail.  Those of you who fear sales pressure?....it doesn’t exist here.  He is direct but gentle, with no hard sell.  Dr. Sasha is high-tech, and works with state-of-the-art instruments allowing him to be thorough, but efficient.  His greatest asset, however, is his expertise and an amazing chair side manner.  Moreover, his assistant was as professional and as competent as he was.  Likewise, the hygienists working there are outstanding, both personally and professionally.  Even fearful patients will find this office remarkably calming.  My recommendation for Dr. Sasha’s dental office is an enthusiastic, YES!  He and his staff are remarkably good…..head and shoulders over a great majority of other dental offices.  He is exactly what you look for in a dentist.  And kudos to Gabi and Gisselle (clinical assistant and hygienist, respectively) for their superior clinical work.   A huge THUMBS UP for New Generation Dentistry.  I will wholeheartedly be back as a regular patient, and will hopefully get others to go there as well.< /review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Not only are you welcomed with bright smiles, they also offer tea, coffee and water while you wait... which in my experience is never long.

Thanks for the great service Dr. Moheb and Team!

Hands down to the best dentist I’ ve ever seen! I can’t thank Dr.Sasha and his team. I am so glad I found them on Google and Yelp and booked my first appointment so easy when I called the office. The first tome I visited , I was so impressed with the office and the very high tech instruments they had such as 3d scaner and making crowns in the same office! Everything was super clean and high tech! Dr.Sasha spent so much time to explain everything in detail to make sure I know what’s going on before doing cleaning. Usuelly with other dentists, they were not putting any effort to educate me. After that great explanation and finding the cause about my gum’s bleeding, he suggested deep gum cleaning which I never even heared of it before and was going just for cleaning to other dentists without helping me stop bleeding everytime I was flossing . He did explain everything in details and made sure I can decide what I want to do without beeing pushy! When I heard about the benefits of doing that, I asked if I could start the same day. The hygienist Antoinette  made sure to num half side and did a great job! They even gave me a electric tooth brush:-) the other half of teeth will be cleaned next week. I can’t tell you enough how happy I am with the gum deep cleaning, already do floss without bleeding or pain and that’s feel so good:-) Already made appointment for my husband and recommend them to everyone I know!< /Text>

<text>My first expirence at this dental office was outstanding. Everything was really clean, along with staff being so kind and professional. After I had  initially done a bit of paperwork they took me in to take some x-rays. I went in knowing I had to get my wisdom teeth removed, one of which is impacted. Later Dr. Sasha went over a panoramic view of my teeth explaining any abnormalities and concerns. My dental hygienist was so gentle. She offered some numbing gel due to my sensitive teeth. Did I mention I got to watch some Netflix while I was getting my cleaning. Lastly Dr. Sasha went over my extraction procedure for the future weeks to come. I left knowing that was well taken care of and I had chosen an excellent dentist.

I’ve been coming to New Generation Dentistry for about a year now. Antoinette my dental hygienist, is always very kind and gentle with me. I let her know the area where my teeth have  been feeling any sensitivity. She was kind enough to numb the area for me before my cleaning. Dr. Sasha was quickly able to address why I was feeling sensitivity to cold on that side of my teeth.  Thank you Anita and N.G.D. Team for all my dental needs.

My most recent visit was just a quick cleaning with my dental hygienist, Antoinette. She was able to take some images of the lower part of my mouth. It eat quite an eye opener when I was able to realize the importance of flossing on a daily bases. 🙏🏾 Thanks Antoinette and everybody at new generation dentistry for being so kind and welcoming.<//text>< Pics>

<Review>I have NEVER in my life looked forward to going to the dentist until now. I switched my entire over to NGD and could not be happier. The exam is so thorough it blew me away and most importantly, everyone is so nice and so welcoming. My little girls love going to the office, mostly for the toy at the end of the visit. The office is decorated that so beautifully and has the most up to date dental technology. We found my dental home :)
UPDATED:
NGD continues to be our favorite dentist ever. My daughters could not wait to go see Dr Sara and Gabi today, what kids are excited to see the dentist? They are amazing and are not out to rip you off. They care about their patients. We LOVE NGD.
UPDATE TO THE UPDATE:
During the crazy Covid shut down. Dr. Sasha  and his team took my little girl in to help with her filling that fell out (Thanks to Candy). They never stop amazing me with their service and kindness. Dental office for life.
Update Post Covid:
Dr. Sara and Dr. Sasha have invited a orthodontist into their practice. A dental one stop shop. How anybody would give new generation dentistry anything less than five stars just totally boggles me.  Truly feel like they are part of the family.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<text>My husband, myself, and our two year old son all had our first appointments here in the last week.  We drive over 20 minutes to get to the office but it is SO worth it.  Every single person on staff, from the receptionist to the hygienists to both Dr. Sasha and Dr. Sara are friendly, welcoming, professional, helpful, courteous, detailed... everything you could ask for.
For my first visit, they did a 3D scan of my entire head, which allowed Dr. Sasha to see everything from my teeth to my sinuses and my jaw.  This was after I had the opportunity to sit down with him in his office and just give him my background, any past issues, etc. AND I got a tour of the office by one of the hygienists.  The cleaning is scheduled for a different appointment than the initial exam so they can make sure to schedule the right amount of time for you.  I consider this very professional!  There was little to no waiting time - very efficient.

I took my son in the next day.  They have separate adult and kids days.  When I came in on the "kids" day, there were kids shows on tv, foam letters and numbers to play with, and I think even a video game off to the side.  This was my son's first "real" dentist visit (he had been once before, but just sat on my lap and the dentist just looked at his teeth and poked around with his fingers).  Dr. Sasha and the hygienist were so friendly and talked to him about his letters and numbers before beginning.  Then he got to sit in the "special chair" and as they leaned him back, there was a TV on the ceiling for him to watch!  She was able to brush, floss, and paint flouride on his teeth.  I was able to talk with her for several minutes about some questions, and my son wanted to explore the office so Dr. Sasha asked the front receptionist to watch him so I didn't have to keep an eye on him.  At the end, he got stickers from the prize box AND a balloon!  More importantly than that,  I feel more confident with how to help take care of my 2 year old's teeth at home because of the detailed instructions that were both explained and modeled for me there.

I cannot recommend this office enough!  Three amazing experiences in the last week (I'll let my husband write his own review).  We look forward to returning every six months!< /text><Rating>5</Rating><Response>None<//Response><user_id>114767791985743214997< /user_id>< GmapID>

< review>
I have only been a patient at New Generation Dentistry and Dr. Sasha's for a few months now.  My initial consultation was very professional and all of my concerns were addressed.  The cleaning was scheduled a few weeks after that and I was very impressed with the facilities, tools, and equipment.  They truly use a "new generation" of equipment that cleans your teeth with the standard scraper with an attached waterpik.  It irrigates the gums to flush and aerate the area.  At first it was a strange sensation, but definitely could tell a difference afterwards.

Dr. Sasha was also great with an issue I had with my night guard.  I had a new night guard made, but was unhappy with the softness at night.  When I showed up for a follow up appointment, Dr. Sasha had already called the company and had a harder night guard ready for me, even before I had discussed my concern directly with him!!!  Saved me another trip to get additional impressions.  I have been very happy as a patient and would recommend Dr. Sasha to anyone in the Mission Viejo, RSM, Wagon Wheel area.<//review>

Dr Sasha is a great man he took care of me immediately when my tooth was really painful and I haven't had any appointment with him and the day after that when I called them Dr Sasha called me right away and took care of me.</Text>

Consistent poor experiences of Yasai messing up or losing our order. Was hoping to give them one more try considering my first experience was so good. Unfortunately they just keep dropping the ball.</Text>

I was in the cerritos area looking for boba milk teas and i seem to have run into the yasai restaurant walking to my destination and ordered a number #20 beef and veggie tempura plate + cali roll (4pcs) and the #80 which is a poke bowl. The food was phenomenal. If your in cerritos area hit up Yasai and enjoy.

<review>Ordered the spicy pork and pic shows it was basically all fat.  Gross!  Rolls weren't that bad.  Chix teriyaki bowl came super dry.  Had to ask for 3 more tiny teriyaki cups to make it ok.  Is teriyaki expensive?  Bc the way they act here it is a super high commodity.< /review>< name>

<text>Usually 5 stars. I have never been disappointed until this last visit.  I asked for light Teri sauce on my salmon plate. It seems like they put extra. The tempura is usually light and has a nice fresh texture to it. Not this visit. It felt and tasted heavy. I didn't even finish my plate. I normally never leave a grain of rice in my container, when I'm done. I don't know if this may have been just an off day,.. I hope thar was the case.</text>< Rate>

The food here is always decent. A lot of rice in proportion to meat, but there's plenty of meat to get full off of. The salads are refreshing. The rolls are okay.

My only big issue is that they can never seem to maintain an A rating from the health department.</Review>

Keep up the good work. If you need lunch or dinner swing by and get something to eat here. The quality is great and so is the quantity. You can't go wrong here. There are places where sometimes the food doesn't taste good every so often that is not this place. The food here is always good never been here once when it wasn't good. Highly recommended.< /Review>< Rate>

Great teriyaki and udon soup. A little expensive but worth it. The combos come with lots of salad. Two people can almost split the combo but I just save the leftovers for later.</Review>

I experienced extremely bad customer service today at Yasai, Cerritos Towne Center and I won’t be back!   Ordered a teriyaki beef bowl which came with salad.  At the time I ordered I wasn’t asked as to what salad I would like, so when I went to the counter to collect my order I asked for the oriental salad.  At this time, the young female who was supposedly training the new man at the counter roared at me that I should have said what I wanted at the time I placed my order.   The thing is, at the time I placed my order I was trying to work out why I hadn’t received the change that I was due which I decided I would just let it go.  So after being told off like a child,  I decided that I would bring up with the young madam the change discrepancy.  She did not offer me reimbursement of my change but once again scolded me for not ordering my salad at the time I placed my order.  Whilst the teriyaki beef was very good,  the customer service was appalling.  Went to Yasai for my lunch, not to be abused!!</Review>

<username>John Wie< /username><Time>1409727009838<//Time><rate>3< /rate><text>Yasai is a basic fast food Japanese restaurant that has a bit more of a fresh collection that you may be surprised by.  They have a selection of all kinds of Japanese cuisine from bowls to sushi to curry with different kinds of meats like chicken/beef/pork and tofu.  Prices will vary around $5-$10 for the most part and there are different sizes/options available.  I usually go for the chicken bowl for about $6 with just the two salads instead of rice.  Brown rice is also available.

Parking is available in the Towne Center itself which there is a lot of.

Again, I come to Yasai for a slightly healthier and affordable option that actually has a solid taste.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80dd2cfef5477d7f:0x35a8923efa5ed1f4</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Eel bowl is so worth getting here!!  Its like a eel avocado salad with a bit of rice on the bottom. Simple quick Japanese joint. Near free public restroom. Located back of bath body works and side of theater.</Text>

Easy on the Wallet and nice on the tongue. I would recommend this to anyone looking for simple Sushi  fare that is a very casual style.  This place is not trying to bring your into a Japanese enclove but a fast food  venture with a Japanese menu, Enjoy.< /Review>

<Review>I LOVEE this place. If you want to try some really good quality sushi this is the place. I am always hesitant to try new places, especially food, but this place is amazing. The services is great and it is very clean. There is often a small wait about 10-15minutes when I go but not too bad. The workers are very nice especially the servers. I recommend try the Alaskan Roll its a more pricey option but so good.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Review>Awful customer service. I asked if there was a way to get extra meat on the side and was told no (by way of head nodding) by some older Asian lady. It took a customer telling her that she could charge me for a side of meat with a combo. The older Asian lady just punched the order in and said “ok it’s $10.14” all the while making no eye contact with me. Sad, lazy, sloppy appearance, careless and unfriendly. This is what you get when you come to this location</Review>< userid>

<review>Sushi, you are the best
To that, I can attest
My adoration for you, I must confess
I crave you 7 days a week, no less
A combo w/ you, sumi salad & miso soup, pure genius
Attempting to eat healthy daily, I progress
Running smoothly & efficiently, is this business
Forevermore, you'll remain my fishy food mistress

(Translated by Google) It's a bit strong.
Easy to eat at low cost.
Please eat outside the restaurant. Then I think it's a picnic

간이 좀 센 편.
저렴하게 간단하게 먹을 수 있음.
식당 안보다 바깥에서 드세요. 그럼 소풍온거 같아요< /Review>

<Text>While the outside and name may make it sound like upscale lounge, that fantasy dies as soon as you walk in.

The beer and wine selection are on par with most bars but the liquors available were terrible. If you're looking for quality this place is one to avoid. There is also no cocktail menu or bartenders that know how make basic one (mine had to look up what a tequila sunrise was)

The atmosphere is cheap, dated, and not maintained that well. It's small and usually filled with your all-day drinkers. There is one pool table and two arcade games from the 80's. This place is definitely not a lounge and has virtually no cocktails. This is very much on the do not recommend list.</Text>< pics>

This was a great place when I was out there.  It used to have a great piano playing girl way back in the 80's a bunch of us went to hear. Glad to see it still kept its charm.< /review>

If you need a place to kill 30 minutes, get a tasty/reasonably prices cocktail, and hide from family that's in town... this place is highly recommended. Too much info?<//review>

Cheap drinks are the best thing that this place has to offer. Beyond that it's inattentive and confrontational staff, sticky tables, loud music, and a warped pool table.

Whatever, they'll get you drunk and I can walk home from here.<//Text>

<Text>The ownership has changed since the last time I came here. The crowd appears younger than before, which is cool, especially if that's what they're going for, but I prefer the old vibe to be honest.< /Text>< Pics>

<text>Awesome place. Haven't touch a gun since 19 years old. The staff was courtesy. The equipment was great. The price is decent. The court was designed nicely. Haven't been there for a long time. Would like to go back after the pandemic.<//text>< Pics>

Good place for group events or team activity. If you are first timer nice to have experienced ppl with you. This is was first time holding a gun and I pretty much hit atleast one clay in each station we went to.

Bring your own safety glasses & ear plugs to avoid overspending. Best to come early and leave early to get access to all the stations.

Would be nice to have coffee, phone charging stations & other items for purchase like a usb cable/charger for phone. My phone died and I was not familiar with the route. Better to have your own car charger handy.< /text>

This place is awesome. It's in a private valley and is very beautiful. These setups for each shoot we're great. Prices are reasonable. The family and our friends had a blast.

Just make sure to get there early. After 11am on the weekends it gets busy and you may have to wait at the stands. We got there before 9 and had no waiting before 11<//Review>

John (trainer) made our Valentine's day perfect! My man and I made a session with John for about 1.5 hours. John went through safety precautions, technique, and coached us through each step of the way. We appreciated how encouraging and patient John throughout our session. When we missed a shot, he gave us suggestions on where to keep our eye the next time or how we can improve. John is a great trainer! We highly recommend him for anyone new or even rusty on their aim trying to improve. You won't regret it!</text>

<Text>This was such an awesome place to have our Company outing!  We heard from our guide that the BBQ is amazing as well and a must for next time. Kirk & Ron took great care of our group(s). They made the newbies (myself) feel comfortable and confident! Everyone working inside was very helpful as well. Nothing but positive things to say about CVSC. Thank you all for a great day; we'll be back for sure!<//Text><username>K B</username>< user>

I have nothing but teriffic things to say about this place.  It's like a high-end golf course for shooting clays.  The people who run it are super friendly and the courses are both well laid out and maintained.  Great for beginners or well seasoned shooters.<//text>

<Text>What a hidden playground. Yes this place is so much fun. Driving in golf carts shooting guns! It is like golf going hole to hole only you shoot with a shotgun. Each station on the main course is different. There are traditional trap and skeet as well. A variety of areas to test your skills. You can rent guns, get snacks and drinks there even beer. So go and enjoy a day outdoors blasting away. Bring a camera as well great sights to photograph.< /Text>< Pics>

Came here as a work trip and was my first time shooting. I was pleasantly surprised by the grounds and the equipment on the property.
The staff was kind and helpful.
The whole operation seemed to be very professionally run, and it was a world away from the hustle of the Bay Area.
We had an instructor who was patient and calm, and who helped us learn to shoot and navigate the course.
All in all, I'll definitely consider coming back if I have the urge to do some shooting again in the future.</text>

< Review>
We went as a family as first timers and had a great time.  The staff are friendly and the atmosphere relaxed.
I'm sure they have plenty of good instructors but I can not emphasize enough how our particular instructor influenced our experience. She is personable, knowledgeable,  patient and expert at spotting our mistakes.
Missed a target?  Irene had spotted the problem before I had pulled the trigger . Some gentle advice and a little adjustment and "Blam"! Little bits of clay filled the sky.
Whether you are a novice or experienced you'll be a better shot by the end of the session.  Definitely, without a doubt, 100% - ask for Irene!< /Review>

<Review>I have been shooting at Coyote Valley Sporting Clays for 3 years so far, but today is my first time experienced issue with them. I have been shooting so far with my 22 inch shot gun that has pistol grip there with no problem, but today the girl at the front desk made it a drama and said "no pistol grip allowed". I always follow the range rules, so I asked her whether there is any rule of Coyote Shooting Clay says "Shotgun with pistol grip is not allowed". She could not find such rule either online or in the rule list posted in the office.

I have been shooting at Coyote Valley Sporting Clays for more than 10 times without any problem with this same 22 inch barrel shotgun which has pistol grip. Today she became the show stopper. At the end, she said I need to contact the owner "Tom" for escalation about "pistol grip" rule, but she cannot allow me to shoot there today. Obviously, I did not violate any rule because there is no such rule yet saying no pistol grip. I asked her how to contact the owner to find out exactly about "pistol grip" rule, so that next time I will just bring another gun, she could not provide me the phone number, but just provided me info@coyote general email address. I also consulted their onsite shooting instructor about "pistol grip" rule. The instructor did not say yes or no about it.

So BEWARE California shotgun owners, "PISTOL GRIP IS NOT WELCOMED" there no matter the barrel length, although they do not have any such rule yet as of Dec 2017.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Great sporting clays and skeet location! Prices are very reasonable, especially when renting from them. Each station has its own unique challenge and the variety is great! It can often be busy, especially on the weekends, but you can expect most people to cycle stations quickly. We keep coming back!<//review>

Great backdrop, nice staff, good place for team bonding, or crew experience. Gun cleaning bench. Food on weekends but if you bring food for after there’s a nice large oak to sit and have a sandwich n soda. Highly recommend it!</review>

This is such an amazing place!! They offer Sporting clays and skeet course.  If you are not familiar, sporting clays are like golf but with shotguns.  The sporting clays range is soo much fun!  You walk to each station (they do rent golf carts) and push a button to launch a clay.  You can work as a team with one person "pulling" the clays or by yourself using the system in delay mode.  You can rent or bring your own gun, can also buy ammo (wal-mart has better deals on ammo).  Each station is unique and you pay by the clay, so if you want you can just stay at a given station all day (making allowances for others who want to play through.)< /text>

With the help of some regulars, this was a fun place to shoot shotguns.  It is a converted golf course, and still has some of the golf course vibe. I don't think I would go without someone who is familiar with gun ranges.<//review>

Great place. I primarily play the sporting clays course. It's a perfect late morning to early afternoon spot with lunch. BBQ is pretty good, not great, not bad, but after shooting for a while it's right there.< /Review>

I booked the guided lessons for a group of eight people. We had two instructors. They were very friendly and took us to multiple shooting stations while explaining how to shoot at each station.

Recommend wearing something warmer during the winter. It gets chilly.< /review>

Best clay range for hundreds of miles.  35 cents per bird, nice ranges, well maintained and stocked.  Borrow great over under remingtons if you don't have a gun, shells are always 1 dollar less per box than stores, has a great gun shop with guns from private sellers and the store.  Has a raffle for shotguns with pretty good chances of winning.  Fridge with cold beverages always, free coffee.  Shop has limited products.  Free shell bags to borrow for the day.  Basically, can show up with just money, nothing else, and can have a great time.</review>

Others are for two types of shot. Still others are full skeet and/or trap setups. I like how you get a little magnetic card that counts how many targets you have shot at. This is the most fun I've had shooting targets in the SF Bay Area.<//Review>< pictures>

Good Part: It is an excellent location. They have a very nice store with a nice selection of guns. MOST of the staff are very nice. Probably the only Sporting Clays around.

Bad Part: It's too crowded on weekends. I never go there on weekends.  Their skeet range could be maintained better. Their Trap range is SAD! They also need to check rounds people are shooting. I have been shooting Skeet and I have been peppered with shot from the Sporting Clays. This has happened on at least 3 different occasions. Last... They give classes at the busiest times. An instructor has one student and a number of "Paying Customers" have to wait around. This seems like Poor Management!<//Text>

I feel like I'm at a Golf course but shooting Clay's instead.  Kind of hard to find if you are going here for the first time, but it's worth it.  I always feel like I'm in the Midwest when I come here and always have a great time with friends.   They have plenty of parking and guns. as well as accessories for rental if needed.</Text>

<review>Bang Bang Bang!

Definitely a great place for a date (depending on the girl) or a surprise date for a guy! What guy/girl doesn't like to shoot and let out some steam?

My friend suggested this place and at first I was skeptical because I was afraid of the recoil from previous experiences with shooting. I'm glad he's a "pro" cause he definitely knew what he was doing. He chose the shotgun with the least amount of recoil. He also warned me about how I would get some bruising on my shoulder from holding the shotgun. Next time, I should bring some shoulder pads or a makeshift shoulder pad.

There are about 20 courses, which is a lot! Each course has their own uniqueness to it. You can even rent a go cart to drive around to the courses. The clay birdies that roll on the ground are usually called "rabbits" which is cute. You can spend from a couple of hours or a whole day shooting.

In our group of 6, we shared about 300 bullets and even had bullets left over. The unopened left overs, you can return. You pay after you finishing shooting. Each of us paid about less $40.

I'll definitely come back, with the right shoes, a hat, shades and my makeshift shoulder pad.<//review>< time>

<text>I’ve shot clays here dozens of times, spent thousands, and have seen the customer service progressively worsen as the business has grown. The most basic courtesies (such as giving the customer the benefit of the doubt) are now forgotten at Coyote Valley Sporting Clays.

Great place to shoot shotguns, sporting clays, trap,or skeet. Take an intro class, they will even rent you a shotgun if you need. Friendly staff, stay for lunch, bring some friends.<//text>

He made sure my mom, brother and I were stress free while planning my dads services. Losing a loved one is never easy and he made sure we were taken care of. Even when viewing my father before the cremation was amazing and he made sure all the little details were taken care of (memorial cards, cross, thank you cards, stands, sign in book,even last minute priest) Everything was beautiful and papa bear had a beautiful service 🙏🏽🕊 thank you so much for everything and making this process as smooth as possible!<//review>< pics>

I can't believe how unprofessional Javier The General Manager was!!!! BAD BAD service and disgusted by his unprofessionalism behavior.  They are charging my family for more money than the original contract that was given, my family member asked to see the contract and Javier the GM Jank it away and would not let her see it. He is heartless no empathy nor compassion. I definitely recommend that before you go there you research elsewhere. They lied to my family member that passed away about the contract they had her sign by making her believe that it was an affordable amount  unfortunately she passed unexpectedly.  The deposit she gave at the beginning doesn't reflect the balance. Very upsetting and to top it off This person General manager  JAVIER  unbelievable.  So rude and so unprofessional.  I can't believe he works there none the less to say he is the general manager. At the end we asked to speak to him again he never came back out. DEFINITELY DO NOT  RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE.<//review>

If you are not 100% certain on the final destination for a loved one to be laid to rest, I suggest that you do not use Valhalla as an interim location. For cremation services in particular, you would be better off using a local (non-corporation) establishment. They charge large fees for refrigeration, even if it was only for five days. I understand that they need to make money, but transportation for less than 20 miles and refrigeration for five days should not have totaled $1,520. After research, the same services between four other locations would average $1,100 to $1,200. When the provider I chose went to retrieve my father, they did not budge on the $1,520. At the end of they day, Valhalla is a corporation, and their number one objective is to make money, not be reasonable. Go there for yourself to see.</text>

< Review>
I felt from day one that they knew they had me over a barrel. Everything was so outrageously expensive (one ex: $500 dollars to drive my son from the chapel to graveside - no more than 20-30 yards)! I constantly felt like I was being kicked when I was already down!!! Things haven't gotten much better in the two years since the funeral. There have been numerous issues with groundskeeping spraying the flower arrangements with grass and dirt due to carelessness, and birthday decorations that were thrown away AFTER I checked with the front office if it was in keeping with their standards. Most recently, there were my son's flower service flowers that weren't ordered when they should've been, and his flower service flowers that were thrown away when they shouldn't have been! When I tried to get help after I discovered his flowers were thrown out, I felt like a fly that everyone was just trying to shoo away, saying "someone will call you on Monday". When I quietly (because a service was being held nearby) expressed my upset feelings to someone named Christina, and walked away towards my son's grave, she sent a security guard to tell me to leave them alone! I had told her that once they have your money, they don't really care about you, and that people should know about that.
Alfredo was very nice and helped me get flowers put back down a couple days later, and Isela tried to help me before the flowers were taken, by re-ordering  my son's flower service, and assuring me that his current flowers could remain an extra month. But someone else, who didn't know what Isela had told me, threw them away anyway.  Maybe it doesn't seem like a big deal to some of the people there, maybe they think "it's just flowers lady",  but when there's nothing left I can do for my son but keep a token of my love for him on his grave, it's a really big deal to me. I do NOT recommend Pierce Brothers!!!< /Review>

My only complaint is that I paid an extra $15 for 15 expidited certificates of death which I have YET to receive. So I would like my money refunded.</Text>< Pictures>

This was my first time planning a memorial and there were things that were not brought up to me that I had to ask. At my mom's memorial, they were late bringing her (they had her in the nurse) because the grounds people weren't there to help because they were late from their lunch (it was during covid and we didn't have anyone to carry her). Nothing felt organized, we were given misinformation and found someone was waiting for us by the gate when we said we'd meet them at the grave site. It ended up being a bit stressful..< /Text>

Is there a way to give zero star? I can't believe the bad customer service I have received from this place. Their billing, customer service and management don't even communicate with each other. We have been double charged for a service on our cards and no one can tell us why and or refund our money. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Please stay away and don't give them your credit card info.< /Review>

It’s unfortunate that companies like this continue to exist. They prey on those in need of unique services and look for every opportunity to exploit them for their financial gain.

Pierce Brothers was incredibly difficult to work with, demonstrated absolutely zero effort to accommodate the family and continually changed the negotiated plans while adding additional costs!

If I could give zero stars I absolutely would!<//text>

Currently we are in pre-need arrangements and it's already a nightmare.  What Pierce Bros currently has is other family members interred there. However,  to sign off on a pre-need contract is uncoordinated and I'm considering breaking tradition and going with other options. At the time my other family members were interred here, Pierce Brothers was a family run mortuary and cemetery but now it's owned and operated Dignity Memorial corporation, North America's largest provider of funeral, cremation and cemetery services. This is no bueno. Run don't walk.</Text>

<Review>I cannot recommend highly enough Pierce Brothers Valhalla. I had to arrange my brothers very unexpected funeral from the UK. Bernie Palomino and his team provided such a caring connection taking me through all the admin etc of arranging a funeral overseas. Their attention to every detail went far beyond what I was expecting. Very grateful for their services.</Review>< Pictures>

There is a book called Ghosts of Literature very well to read it also explains the eternity of the soul and it strengthens and gives a good feeling

And We recommend giving every family who comes here to give a disc with explanations and proofs that there is life after life or Rabbi Zamir Cohen's book called the upheaval or anything that will strengthen the family

Anyway the service here is excellent<//Text>

Pierce Brothers Valhalla and Michael Gorman were by far the WORST!! All Michael Gorman was interested in was money. He told me that if I didn't buy an upgraded waterproof vault my loved one would "be underwater when it rains". If we wanted our graveside service on Saturday, Sunday or Friday it would cost $2050.00 additional for "overtime charges". When we failed to return certain forms to his satisfaction, he threatened to "postpone the graveside service". (Pierce Brothers had already been paid in full.)I could cite numerous other rude and unprofessional comments made by Michael Gorman. Needless to say, I will never recommend Pierce Brothers or Michael Gorman to anyone in need of funeral arrangements.</text>< time>

<Text>Last week I called to find the location of graves for two family members.  I received a call back within the hour with the information.  Today we went to find the graves.  The staff were very helpful.  Gave us a detailed map and a business card with a cell phone for additional help if we needed it to locate the grave.  So, five stars for the staff.

But the grounds are not the best.  It looks like they are trying to improve things: watering the lawn, curb markers freshly painted. But, there are still many graves covered by mud; so badly that you can't even read the name.  So two stars for maintenance.  I hope they continue to improve the grounds.  It does look like they are trying.</Text>< Pictures>

I have no complaints with their service.... My issue is that they have some ugly rules for the cemetery, I recently was there with a few family members to visit my mother and the security approaches us to tell us to bring down our pop up shade , as well as remind us that we can't have any type of table set up or pre cooked food to hang out for a min... It's a cemetery! Where people's loved ones rest for ever!..... The cemetery has rules that make it so uncomfortable to hang out for a few hours.... It's a coping method for us humans to go hang out with our loved ones and the cemetery makes it to where it's so uncomfortable that you end up under the sun because they make sure to keep their trees trimmed to where there's no shade.... They don't have a heart for death! they want the money! they care less for the ones who stay behind suffering that need the coping with their loved ones. They need to change their rules... They even took away the rolling shade available to the public that was provided by the cemetery. What do the want us to do... Bury our loved ones and forget about them, don't visit them !.... What's wrong with management... Rules need to change... Imagine if the whole and I mean whoooooole family was protesting in the front of the cemetery, informing people about their shi**y rules.<//text>

<Text>I feel so sorry for the people laid to rest here and also visiting family members etc trying to find gravesites. All the headstones  or placards ate covered in mud  and you can’t read them even if you were able to find them. And that’s a big if. When you drive to try to go find your love ones sites they are supposedly marked with curb markers to guide you. The curb markers haven’t been touched up with paint and what looks like 50 years. For someone grieving trying to find their loved one this is very very frustrating. The office staff is rude and clueless. We finally had to call someone to come out here and help us find my grandma’s grave site  because there is absolutely no navigating this on your own when you can’t see faded marker points. It’s one of the most shameful things I have ever EVER seen. My grandma is only here because her  parents  are here also.  I wish I could move all three of them heck out of here.< /Text>< username>

Both my parents have been buried there for more than a decade, initially the upkeep of grave site was adequate. My daughter has visited the site many times and sent me photos. The area around the graves is unkempt and in deplorable condition. Both my daughter and I have complained in the past to Valhalla staff and been reassured that the problem would be resolved . My daughter visited site yesterday and nothing was done. I feel it is disrespectful to mu parents as they paid good money to Valhalla for what they thought would be a well maintained location for eternity. WE are all dismayed  at the response we've received from current staff</review>

<text>My father was recently laid to rest here. They were late putting the flowers out in the chapel. It took a very long time to get the casket into the hearse, and thats when things got bad. A van from the funeral home aggressively cut into the procession line. Once the van finally stopped the hearse, they informed us that they had dug the wrong grave. I was driving a 15 passenger van containing my fathers children, grand children and great grand children. We all had to watch in disbelief and utter sadness as golf carts and a backhoe raced around. We literally watched them dig my fathers grave. Scramble to get seating arranged and dirt covered. These are NOT supposed to be lasting memories of such an event. I'd give 1/16 of a star if possible. Believe it or not, there was another family attending the service whose parents are buried there and they had a similar experience.</text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

<text>Avoid this place at all costs. I have my Daughter and recently Father buried here. The place has become a nightmare for those visiting our loved ones.
The service is horrible, I paid for a vase to be placed on my father's grave since they did not honor the word they gave me when we buried him. Since I have my daughter and ex-wife also buried here, they said they would add a vase to my father's grave for us. That was in Oct 2016 a year later they now don't recall offering this to us. So I paid just over $100.00 for one and was told it takes about 4-6 weeks to install. after waiting 6 months they now claim the don't show any record of an order or payment for such. The claimed they don't keep the receipts so I would have to find mine a year later and give it to them. Fast Forward to 10-2-2018 I found the receipt, Called the office and they said a SPECIALIST would call me soon to resolve the problem.

Don't hold your breath, They never called. Going to call them again today and visit this weekend in hopes to resolve this issue.

Another issue I continue to have, We chose this place because it's close to home. The rules state no artificial flowers and everything will be cleared every tuesday. People not only leave artificial flowers but they add solar lights and small fences around the burial plot. It has become so out of control that now they take more and more space encroaching on others graves. I complained in person and was told that yes they have a policy but everything is removed on that tuesday. That is nothing but BS. I went that Tuesday and Wednesday  and nothing was removed.

This was important to us as I visit often with my elderly mother who wants to spend time with my father at the grave.
It has become so bad that the artificial flowers look like plastic trash. The Solar lights are all rusted and the fences they place around the graves have become broken and weathered.
The place looks like a dump. Now more and more people are doing the same thing. If I can't get them to enforce the laws they have before we purchased the plots, then I will sue to have my family moved to another location. I have complained to everyone with no results. They claim they will call back and never do.

Go elsewhere and save yourself the heartache. We paid good money for it and included a double plot for my Mother. I don't want to keep fighting with them over rules we all agreed too prior to making this purchase.</text><Response>{'time': 1590171010972, 'text': 'Fernando, I am disheartened to read of the troubles you describe.

Our beloved brothers casket was ordered to be blue .. they put him on a grey casket ..AND without asking , we ordered 2 plots ..they had to take the casket out of the tomb because they didn’t dig deep enough.. imagine you going through so much pain and still have to deal with this company ineptitude!! Most extreme horrible service.. please be aware and bury someplace else and read reviews they help .. I wish I had!< /review><date>1529609956547</date>< userid>

Cozy buildings and small parkinglot but perfect for your average size funerals. The grounds are beautiful and well kept.< /Text>

I want to share my experience  that I had at Pierce Brothers Valhalla Cemetary in North Hollywood Ca, with Michael G Gorman. I wanted to say that I highly recommend them to anyone in need of these types of services . It was my first time at this Cemetary . When I arrived I met with Michael G Gorman I explained to him that I have never done these types of arrangements before and was not familiar with anything at all and I needed help and guidance. So he sat my children and I down and explaned the whole process. From start to finish. He was so helpful, wonderful,  polite,  friendly and  very professional. I was  very impressed  with his  customer service, He answered all our questions. He gave us a tour  around the cemetary and showed us exactly how and what would be done.  I also noticed how everything  was very nice, clean, and organized.  Michael G Gorman guided us every step of the way, he was always there to check if we needed anything and was also present the day of the funeral to  make sure we understood everything  or if we had any questions and most important to make sure that everything went perfect .
I am very happy and pleased with the choice we made. Michael G Gorman went
above and beyond  to make his customers happy.
And so far it has been the best customer service I have received.
Thank You so much Michael G Gorman and Pierce Brothers Valhalla Staff, We appreciate  all of your Help,

Angelica Gutierrez

It’s been 6 months since I paid for my Dad’s headstone. I was told I would get a draft in 3 weeks for a sign off but nothing yet! Not even an update.  I’ve left voicemails and emails for Nayeli, the girl I did the contract with and yet no response from her. Every time I call and ask to speak to a supervisor, I end up talking to someone new and have to explain my situation all over again. We’ve asked the people in the office and they’re all clueless. I paid $3000 in full! There is no excuse for running a business this way. Not only is this a big expense but this is someone’s loved one you’re talking about! Shame on you!<//Text>

<Review>Horrible! They have made this already trying time even worse. They explained everything half way and when we questioned anything they made it seem like we were the ones that were wrong. We waited over 4 hours to make  the arrangements while Mario did who knows what. We had a contract with Nicole saying everything was included and after signing everything they charged us more. We came back just to pay and they made us wait another 2 hours because they couldn't find the file. Then they lost forms that were emailed form different states, but never informed us that they didn't have them. They told us to make a slideshow and when we took it to them they told us that they only needed the pictures and that they were going to make the slideshow, but charge us $300 to make it. The list goes on. If my grandfather wasn't already resting here we'd burry my grandmother elsewhere.< /Review>< Pictures>

Graves were covered in tire marks, trash, mud, grass, and other debris.  Who's responsibility is to clean that up?</text>

If you have not been here... come here. It’s not expensive. It gets packed so make reservations if you need a lot of space. They have drinks for adults too so come! There is lots of selection for sushi lovers so don’t double think it. The food isn’t the great but it passes my expectation for the price.<//Review>

Profesional and ideal service for Guatemala, assure delivery in 8 to 10 days but sometimes it can take a bit longer. Do have restrictions on things you can send so make sure to ask.<//text>

<review>(Translated by Google) Heart I say look elsewhere I'm not qualify or anything. But I sent a box to the gift Guatemala told me the price but never told me that they were to leave my house in Guatemala had to pay more. But that's the least of the open Avia box. We realized that things were missing. They are material things but one makes a sacrifice to send them something ala family and for these you are paying extortionate and even do what they do very bad service apart ... God bless ...

(Original)
De corazón les digo busque en otro lado yo no soy de calificar ni nada. Pero yo envié una caja a Guatemala el don me dijo el precio pero jamás me dijo que para que la fueran a dejar a mi casa en Guatemala tenía que pagar mas. Pero eso es lo de menos la caja la avía abierto. Nos dimos cuenta que hacían falta cosas. Se que son cosas materiales pero uno hace un sacrificio para enviarles algo ala familia y para que estos abusivos le estemos pagando y aun hacen lo que hacen aparte muy mal servicio... que Dios los bendiga...<//review>< resp>

<review>(Translated by Google) I HAD SENT FOR YEARS AND THEY HAD OK SERVICE BUT NOW, VERY BAD SERVICE, THEY STOLE THINGS, THEY BROKE THINGS AND THEY DO NOT PAY BACK, THEY PROMISE YOU THAT THEY WILLREINBURSE BUT THEN THEY HAVE EXCUSES TO DO THE RIGHT THING. THEY DO NOT HONOR THEIR WORD. YOU BRING 10 POUNDS AND THEY CHARGE YOU FOR 12 LBS. I BOUGHT A NEW WEIGHT MACHINE AND THEY DID IT AGAIN. THEY ARE THIEVES AND LIERS !!!!!

THEY HAVE BECOME SUCH A BAD COMPANY, TAKING ADVANTAGE OF EVERYONE !!!!!! I I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY TO NOBODY AND KING EXPRESS REMEMBER ... WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND !!!!!!

I am very disappointed with how the quality and service of this company have decreased, I have sent shipments for years and it was good service but this year they have let me down. A couple of times they charged me 12 pounds for multiple shipments when I had weighed them and it was 10 pounds. In this last shipment, broken things arrived, some blouses and makeup did not arrive. I sent it in a bag and in Guatemala they received it and transferred it to a box where it was emptier. I sent the clothes in special sealed Hefty bags and these did not arrive, they opened and stole and then they tell you that it was customs and that when they received the things they fixed them and my friend who received the box told me that the things were thrown as if they would have thrown them away. They apologize and promise you a refund but they are false promises, then they get rid of their great responsibility. I no longer trust this company and I do not harass anyone, they are not professionals but thieves, they do not realize the efforts that one makes to make these shipments, not only the expense of products, the cost of shipping but also the distances that one drives to bring this to the premises, they do not value anything they are false. So I advise you not to waste your time with this filthy agency and look for another means to send your packages, because this company is no longer reliable.

Estoy muy decepcionada de como a bajado la calidad y el servicio de esta compañía, hize envíos por años y era buen servicio pero este año me han defraudado.  Un par de veces me cobraron 12 libras por varios envios cuando yo los habia pesdo y eran 10 libras.  En este ultimo envío, llegaron cosas rotas, no llegaron algunas blusas y maquillaje.  Lo envie en una bolsa y en Guatemala lo recibierony lo pasaron  a una cajota donde estaba mas vacía.  La ropa la envie en bolsas sellada especiales de Hefty y estas no llegaron, abrieron y robaron y luego te dicen que fue aduana y que ellos al recibir las cosas las arreglan y mi amiga que recibio la caja me indico que las cosas estaban tiradas como si las hubieran hechado a la basura.  Se disculpan y te prometen re-embolso pero son falsas promesas, luego  se safan de su gran responsabilidad.  No confio mas en esta compañia y no la acosenjo a nadie, no son profesionales si no unos ladrones, no se dan cuenta los esfuerzos que uno hace para hacer estos envíos, no solo el gasto de productos, el costo del envio sino que las distancias que uno maneja para llevar esto al local, no valoran nada son falsos.  Asi que aconsejo no pierdan su tiempo con esta agencia que es una porqueria y busquen otro medio para enviar sus paquetes, porque esta compañía ya no es confiable.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Contract your services to send my car and several boxes because I am going back to live in Guatemala and yesterday they delivered the house to my house in Puerto Barrios and I am already walking the car that they took me. Needless to say, I am delighted with your service. I recommend them to anyone who needs to send things to Guatemala.

<text>(Translated by Google) The worst delivery service ... please my people don't trust them in Guatemala they say and promise one thing. That your package will be sent to your address. And when they arrive in the United States. They call you and tell you that you have to go and pick it up. Please if you read this before sending something for this service, believe me, you will thank me. Also the man who works here in the United States offices. He is arrogant. Pedant and the only thing it does is give you a shout when you try to explain what they said to your family in your country ...... please think it over before using this service ... DO NOT RECOMMEND IT DO ... Oh and another thing in Guate they tell your family that the package arrives in three days and that is not true either ... they take more than 8 days and apart you have to go to their offices ...

(Original)
El peor servico de entrega... por favor mi gente no confien en ellos en Guatemala dicen y prometen una cosa. Que tu paquete sera enviado a tu domicilio. Y cuando llegan a estados Unidos. Te llaman y te dicen que tienes que ir tu a recogerlo. Por favor si leen esto antes de enviar algo por este servico creanme me lo van a agradecer.  Ademas el señor que trabaja aqui en las ofinas de Estados unido. Es un arrogante. Pedante y lo unico que hace es darte una gritada cuando tratas de explicarle lo que le dijieron ellos a tu familia en tu pais......  por favor piensenlo bien antes de usar este servicio... NO LO RECOMIE DO....  ah y otra cosa en Guate le dicen a tu familia que el paquete llega en tres dias y no es cierto eso tampoco... tardan mas de 8 dias y aparte tienes que ir a sus oficinas...</text>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) Please stay away from this company crap, they give a terrible service, they lie to the consumer, I sent two packages to Guatemala so that my family would pick them up at their offices there and thank God I did not give my family address only the number of On the phone, the first package was delivered to the first recipient the second they say they delivered it to a woman named Nuria Montoya that my family or I do not know, they wrote maybe a fake DPI and the packages contained wedding invitations was not worth anything that they need or could use.
Please do not put your personal information or put your relatives at risk in Guatemala by using the services of these irresponsible people who only charge dearly for a package that does not weigh even 1 pound.
From experience I tell you it is better to pay DHL, Fedex or UPS than to use these people who do not care about customer service.
I report them to the Better Bussines Bereau so that Paqueteria Express is registered of the bad service and irresponsibility that the employees handle.

Por favor mantengase alejados de esta porqueria de compañia dan un pesimo servicio, mienten al consumidor, yo envie dos paquetes a Guatemala para que mi familia los recogiera en las oficinas de ellos alla y gracias a Dios no di direccion de mi familia solo los numero de telefono, el primer paquete se lo entregaron al primer destinatario el segundo ellos dicen que se lo entregaron a una mujer llamada Nuria Montoya que mi familia o yo NO conocemos, escribieron quizas un DPI falso y los paquetes contenian invitaciones de boda no iba nada de valor que necesitaran o pudieran usar.
Por favor no pongan su informacion personal ni pongan en riesgo a sus familiares en guatemala al utilizar los servicios de esta gente irresponsable que solo cobran carisimo por un paquete que no pesa ni 1 libra.
Por experiencia les digo es mejor pagar DHL, Fedex o UPS que usar esta gente que no les importa el servicio al cliente.
Yo los reporte al Better Bussines Bereau para que Paqueteria Express quede registrada del mal servicio e irresponsabilidad que manejan los empleados.<//text>

(Translated by Google) I and my family have used their services for a long time and the last time I was SURPRISED when a graduate from Gutemala gave us her account number to deposit 3,000 quetzales since the SAT is supposedly charging that tax. The strange thing is that only things used ivan, the only thing new is a bicycle of 70 dollars and other things for Christmas, which did not exceed $ 270.00 dollars. Now the said lic. Tarazena does not answer calls. Maybe I intend to keep the merchandise? CARE NOW THEY ARE BEING RATS.

(Original)
Yo y mi familia hemos utilizado sus servicios  desde mucho tiempo y la ultima vez me SORPRENDI cuando una tal licenciada en Gutemala,nos dio su numero de cuenta para que depositemos 3,000 quetzales ya que supuestamente la SAT esta cobrando dicho impuesto. Lo raro es que solo cosas usadas ivan, lo unico nuevo una bicicleta de 70 dolares y otras cositas para navidad, que no pasaban de $270.00 dolares. Ahora la dicha lic. Tarazena no contesta las llamadas. Talvez le intereo qudarse con la mercancia?  CUIDADO AHORA SE ESTAN PORTANDO  RATAS.</Review>

(Translated by Google) I sent a package from Fresno to Guatemala City I sent the package on July 25 on a Monday, they supposedly told me that the package was going to arrive between the first and third of August, that's fine, I said I paid for the package and that's how it was because they decided not to say nothing until Thursday, August 4 When I called that the package was stopped in Mexico because of another package they stopped all shipments how is it possible that they can stop all packages Yes just one only one wrong? and how is it possible that they can give a date and then find out that the packages are stopped and not give this information to one who has already paid for the service? p Today we are on August 9 and the package is still in Mexico and one Call King Express parcel and the woman who answers the phone gets angry and tells one that she does not know with a bad character she is offended .... because she gets angry if they are the ones who cannot tell one when these things happen? Especially when it is not a matter of fixing from one day to another but it will last for days or weeks because even now I do not know when the package will arrive to my relatives in Guatemala! what a bad service if there was the option of putting them a little Star That is the one that I would choose for employees with bad character for not notifying me the day or the next day that my package was retained and for nowadays not to give me news I have to be calling to find out what's going on with my package. and so they do not give reimbursement or credit so that one may think of them to send something again, I doubt that I will use this service again because they do not serve any luck to those who decide to send a package to Central America or Mexico because with This experience that I really had, I tell you what a bad service ...

Yo envié un paquete desde fresno a la ciudad de Guatemala envié el paquete el 25 de julio un lunes supuestamente me dijeron que el paquete iba a llegar entre el primero y tercero de agosto está bien dije yo pagué el paquete y así quedó pues ellos decidieron no decir nada hasta el jueves 4 de agosto Cuando yo llamé que el paquete estaba detenido en México por culpa de otro paquete detuvieron todos los envíos cómo es posible que puedan detener todos los paquetes Sí nomás iva a uno solo  mal  ??? y cómo es posible que ellos puedan dar una fecha y luego enterarse de que están detenidos los paquetes y ni darle esta información a uno que ya pagó el servicio ??p Hoy estamos a 9 de agosto y el paquete sigue en México y uno Llama a paquetería King Exprés y la mujer que contesta el teléfono se enoja y le dice a uno que no sabe con mal carácter ella la ofendida ....  porque se enoja si ellos son los que no le pueden decirle a uno cuando estas cosas pasan ? Especialmente cuando no es cosa de arreglar de un día para otro sino que durará  días o semanas porque hasta ahorita no sé cuándo le va a llegar el paquete a mis familiares en Guatemala!!  qué mal servicio si estuviera la opción de ponerles ninguna Estrellita Esa es la que yo eligiría por empleados con mal carácter por no avisarme el día o el siguiente día de que mi paquete estaba retenido y por hasta hoy en día no darme noticias yo tengo que estar llamando para saber qué está pasando con mi paquete.  y así no dan reembolso ni crédito para ke uno tal vez pensar en ellos para enviar algo otra vez,  dudo que vaya a usar yo otra vez este servicio porque no sirven para nada suerte a los que decidan Enviar un paquete a Centroamérica o a México porqué con esta experiencia que yo tuve de verdad les digo que qué mal servicio...</text>

(Translated by Google) A long time ago I used them to send letters to my family in Guatemala from New York but I stopped using them years ago and now that I needed them again all the offices were closed. I searched the internet and found them but only with an office in Los Angeles. I called them and they explained how I could do to send my package to Guatemala. I decided to take the risk and send my package to his office in Los Angeles, which appears on his website. In a week my wife already had the package in her hands. I am very satisfied with your services because everything happened as explained to me and everything was very easy.

Decidi correr el riesgo y mande mi paquete a su oficina en Los Angeles, la que aparece en su website.  en una semana mi esposa ya tenia el paquete en sus manos.  estoy muy satisfecho con sus servicios porque todo paso tal y como me lo explicaron y todo fue muy facil.</Text>

I live in Van Nuys and they pick up my boxes and send them to Guatemala and sometimes if I don't have money here, my family can pay for the shipping in Guatemala, that's why I always send with them. God bless you and set you apart from all evil

(Translated by Google) Packages do not arrive in the time that they say according to 10 to 12 days. Customer service is lousy. The shipment we made takes over a month and hasn't arrived and didn't even weigh a pound. I do not recommend it at all because the experience has been bad.

(Original)
No llegan los paquetes en el tiempo que dicen que según de 10 a 12 días. El servicio al cliente es pésimo. El envío que hicimos lleva más de un mes y no ha llegado y ni siquiera pesaba una libra. No lo recomiendo para nada pues ha sido mala la experiencia.< /Text>

<Text>My family absolutely loves this place. We just moved to this state in July and This is the first time my son has ever express interest in jujitsu and has truly thrived because of his instructors. The owner and his wife are very sincere people. The instructors take their time to ensure that my child accomplishes the moves they have been shown and encourages the kids also. Even the parents at this facility are wonderful. Communication between instructors, kids and parents is wonderful. I couldn’t ask for a better experience!</Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

The best place for anyone looking to start training or improve their game. Sensei Paulo and Sensei Adam go above and beyond to make everyone feel welcome. Paulo puts an emphasis on his students feeling comfortable and confident, cultivating a great setting for families to come train together. I joined about 3 years ago, and my dad joined shortly after I did, I think we would both agree it was one of the best decisions we've ever made.< /Review>

My family was going here before the pandemic and I want people to know how great it was to go especially for families and individuals who want to train several aspects of mixed martial arts, they lost their Muay thai trainer some time back but that is only thing they are lacking and only because they only hire trainers who are dedicated to the job and the ones there definitely are. My family and I will be back soon.< /Review>

<review>THE best place in San Diego to learn Judo and Jiu Jitsu. The amount of years Paulo has been practicing and teaching Judo and Jiu Jitsu since the 70's shows in the vast amount of experience he has. The community that he helps foster and makes everyone feel very welcome here are some of the reasons I continue to stay. The kids classes are well run and both my daughters look forward to coming in and learning.  There are also boxing classes and Muay Thai along with functional fitness classes as well. This really is a great place to get in shape, meet new friends and learn a new skill!!!<//review>< UserId.>

When you step into the gym there is always someone to greet you.  When you leave they gym you have entered a family.  It is the best place in the world. I have been going for almost 8 years now and I couldn't have found a better place in my wildest dreams. We have a teen class at 6 to 7 for 13 and up.</text>

<review>We’re really glad that we found SDBJJ. Sensei Fernando, Sensei Wes and the team here are fantastic. We enrolled our little guy and they are super patient with him while teaching structure and respect you’d expect in a martial art. He loves going to his classes!! They are organized, great instructors, and genuinely engage with their students. As a business owner myself, I know how difficult it is to consistently provide this level of service, and they work hard to make it happen. We highly recommend them!!<//review>< Pictures>

It only took ONE visit for my child and me to see that San Diego Brazilian Jui Jitsu was where we wanted to be. The physical skills taught are extraordinary. However, combined with character development and accountability in all walks of life makes SDBJJ simply exemplary.</review>

You wouldn’t find a better place than sdbjj to train and learn the art of bjj/judo and other disciplines of MMA. Friendly staff and members make it a family friendly gym where everyone can learn and grow; not only in martial arts, but as a person....
The equipment and set up is out of this world..</review>

<review>I tried BJJ severals years ago in another state and suffered a bad injury. I have always wanted to train again, but after my previous experience I was hesitant. 10 years later I have found a home at SDBJJ. Everyone from the coaches to the students are welcoming and want you to be successful. The facility is huge with plenty of space to train and always clean. Sensei Paulo and Sensei Adam make attending class fun while you learn. Sensei Paulo and the upper belts always put an emphasis on safety, which is very important at my age. I highly recommend SDBJJ</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<text>I came to SDBJJ about three years ago in search of an activity to help my two sons build confidence, respect, and self-discipline. My search was successful. The jui-jitsu, boxing, and fitness programs at this amazing facility are all top notch. The Senseis, coaches, and staff are all extremely knowledgeable and caring. This is a great place for the whole family.<//text><UserId.>101601375156625400480< /UserId.>< gmap_id>

I started training here with no previous fighting experience and trained here for about 1.5 years. Even when I had to move (due to work) they helped me choose an academy at my new location. Super supportive!

My recommendation: If you're thinking about trying out the sport, do it here! :)< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

I love this place.  If you’re considering BJJ, this is the place to learn. The instructors are top notch.  You won’t find any egos that you find at many other gyms.  From the black belts down to the beginner white belts. Everyone is very welcoming.<//Review>

<Text>My two sons and I have been going to SDBJJ for over 8 years now and this place is gold. It has done so much for our family and every time we step on the mat we try to give back to the newer students. I travel all over the world for work and drop in other schools often, and let me tell you, this is one of the best schools to train anywhere in the planet. Thank you Sensei Paulo, Adam, and all of the highly respected and technical players and dozens of black belts that have been created here and train regularly at SDBJJ. You have all helped make us better versions of ourselves.<//Text>< resp>

Great school for martial arts training.  Have been to the NoGi, Judo, BJJ, Boxing and Kickboxing classes offered by this school.  The instructors know their craft and can motivate.  Positive atmosphere that can accommodate the most competitive and also beginning students as well as families.

I have been training here for a year and in martial arts for many years in schools across the US.  This school ranks among the very best.  Highly recommend you come in and train here!!< /text>

<Text>This place is like a second home to many of us. Out of all of my hobbies and interests, BJJ is the last one I would sacrifice. It checks off all of the boxes of growing as a person - from the physical demands, mental challenge, dedication required, humility acquired, and the community available. It's a lot of fun too.

Professors Paulo and Adam are great guys that are always there for their students. A relaxed family environment, with students that range from father/daughter enthusiasts, to dedicated competitors.

Come try a class. I promise it will be more fulfilling than scrolling through Instagram for and hour and a half.</Text>< Pics>

I’ve been attending classes now for a year and was completely new at the time. Sensei Paulo and everyone are like family. He literally walked me through the entire facility introducing me to everyone he saw as if he has known me for years. In a sport that can be intimidating and new for folks any unease was completely removed. The staff is solid 10/10. I wouldn’t train anywhere else and plan on getting my kids involved soon too. The members are now friends/family, it’s extremely welcoming and safe for all ages and level of experience. Much love osssss!< /Text>

SD BJJ is an amazing gym. I signed up a month or two ago and I've only been able to go a couple times due to increased hours at work, which thank God will be ending soon. But anyways, the first day there I felt like I had already been going there for a long time. It's a very friendly environment and no one has an ego. Another thing, Paolo is a very nice guy who is willing to help you out when needed. Out of any other BJJ/MMA gym I have been to, this one is by far the best!<//Review>

The gym, the staff, and the other competitors make you feel that way.  Whether it's a simple hello or reminding you it's OK to know absolutely NOTHING about the sport!  I have been going to Sdbjj just over a year and some days feel like day 1 and no one holds it against you.  Jiu-jitsu can be intimidating, especially for women, so being able to find a place and instructors all in one who are knowledgeable, skilled, and personable was pretty much a home run.  They teach not tell and that keeps me going back.</Review><GmapID>0x80db8ab1487d6665:0x867462a8f96e2cbf< /GmapID>< username>

I have trained at a few other schools over the years and this one has been the best. It is always a concern whom you are training with. The people here are great and it has a family feel. There are high level competitive students as well as more hobbiests/ athletes.

My daughter started two years ago with hesitation and a lack of confidence. Not just in her abilities, but in life. She is now 15 and trains bjj and kickboxing at least four times a week. She is much more confident in the gym and in life. It was great training in the same gym as her. Her athleticism has improved and she is better prepared for volleyball and soccer during those seasons. Paulo has been flexible with her other sports training.

This facility, instructors, training hours, variety of classes (kickboxing, bjj, judo, fitness, etc) and the quality and quantity of other students is perfect to develop as a student. I highly recommend sdbjj.< /review>

Best Dojo in San Diego!!! All sensi and coaches are amazing, they welcome you in as family.  My family and I have been going here for almost 4 years, we are extremely happy. You will find they provide you as a student or your child with extensive training to the knowledge each sensi has to offer. A great activity and environment for the kids to gain confidence, self defense, discipline, respect and a hard work ethic. SDBJJ offers an affordable family plan, it’s worth the investment.</review>

<review>SDBJJ is hands down a top notch school. The training you receive is first class but to me the best thing about SDBJJ is the family atmosphere, that makes the school number 1.<//review></record>

We love coming to SDBJJ. My 5 year old and 9 year old sons both attend judo and jujitsu class here. The teachers are so invested in the students. Even though we are pretty new- I can already see why this dojo has such a great reputation in the community- We are so happy we found SDBJJ!</text>

SDBJJ is more than just a judo/Jits school.... they’re a family. The staff are always looking out for the students best interest. All the senseis are great mentors, instructors, kind and caring. Most importantly, they are able to connect with each student at their developmental age. I have seen many positive changes in my daughter since she started here. Their classes are taught by the absolute best in this field. As a parent, SDBJJ has been one of the best choices I've made.  The entire staff is very professional, knowledgeable and just awesome!! as my daughter says.
Their philosophy of teaching resonates with the students. Well defined, disciplined as well as inviting and welcoming. Visit and see why Sensei Paulo and his team are the best choice!!< /Review>

<pictures>None</pictures><rate>5</rate><Review>My daughter started at sdbjj and loved it. She started out with only jiu jitsu and judo then about 6 months later she added muay thai. After that we were there 6 days a week. She has made so many new friends . People that belong to the dojo are some of the most welcoming and accepting people we have met here in CA. The instructors are the best, they are not only teachers, they are great role models.
Paulo ended up convincing me to give it a try. I wanted to but I am extremely shy and lack confidence in myself. Eventually I tried it. It was so much fun even though it was intimidating. The guys treated me like I have been coming forever instead of just starting. Being one of the few woman didn't make them shy away either.
I'm glad to have wondered into this dojo. Everyone there is like family. They are so welcoming you feel like you fit in at once.< /Review>< Time>

<text>When my interest in BJJ peaked, all roads lead to SDBJJ. It was unique that a host of friends & people I knew ranging from white collar professionals to your average blue collar workers were all connected soley by way of SDBJJ.
The culture is beyond learning an art. From the detailed attention in classes, cleanliness & tremendous emphasis on safety, it is a solid business that will be around, & dedicated to growth without outgrowing service.
From another angle, & counter intuitive of some’s belief regarding BJJ, being an individual sport, I am always in awe of the kids training. So much emphasis goes into not only confidence building, but anti bullying, & teamwork. Please Note: If you’re a wanna be tough guy, thinking you’re in the Octagon, who is above the rules of safety, this isn’t the club for you. The Sensis won’t allow it, but more importantly the community and culture of SDBJJ won’t allow it. SDBJJ can be best described as Controlled Combat within a Culture of Clean Community and Caring.

My husband started 3 years ago and this place changed him. I couldn’t help but wonder what I was missing out on, so, the whole family joined him on his journey. We have two daughters age 7 & 8 that love coming to class. It has done wonders for their confidence and has taught them about hard work, goals, and overcoming defeat. My older daughter went from being an introvert to a confident social bug. Being a working mom I too have started Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu thanks to the safe family atmosphere the owner Paulo Augusto provides. Paulo also created a one of a kind safety system for the kids by having them wear a bracelet that represents their comfort & technique level allowing them to work with similar partners while keeping a safe and trusting environment for the kids in addition to the traditional belts. This place has become our family’s center point, where we can all come together through a shared experience to learn and have fun as a family. To get away from the daily grind and achieve together. I am achieving goals mentally and physically through Brazilian JiuJitsu that I didn’t think possible. The prices are also amazing, you won’t find better. The instructors Dillon & Adam are top of the line. Sensei Dillon always goes out of his way during class to work with everyone and is always accessible for questions and training, even in a large class you will find that you receive one on one instruction, you won’t find this anywhere else. Both my girls also did summer camp with Sensei Adam and they had a blast! You would have to see Sensei Adam in action, words can’t describe how amazing he is with kids.</text>

My experience at SDBJJ has been 5 stars. What other school in North County San Diego offers top-level Jiu Jitsu, Judo, Muay Thai, boxing and fitness all under the same roof? Located in San Marcos, students travel from Escondido to Oceanside/Carlsbad to train with our many skilled instructors. Bolstering over 4,000 square feet of mat space and several hundred members, we have room for those with all levels of experience. This gym provides community and feels like a family. Come check out one of our kids or adult classes!< /Text>

We had both our son and daughter in the program last year. Had a great experience  and would highly recommend. The owners and the teachers really care about helping the kids develop not only with the sport,  but emotionally and physically to help with anything they do in their lives. Our son particularily benefited from the program and it seemed to help his coordination and confidence. We plan on enrolling him again in the program next year as he has asked many times to rejoin. Highly recommend!</text>

< Review>
My Grandson has been training here for a year now. Previously I had him training at another highly rated Jiu-Jitsu school in the Carlsbad area. He also trained there for one year.
The difference lies in this, the other school does have good and above average teaching, but it is very clique, in the fact that there is a favoritism to the children that are stars on there completion team. Not all children get equal time. Not so at SDBJJ all children and parents are treated equally here competitor or not
Since coming to SDBJJ my Grandson has grown immensely in the art. He has confidence and is showing on the mat.
He recently competed in a tournament in Los Angeles and won a silver medal with four other fighters in his group.
I contribute all this to the Jiu-Jitsu staff at SDBJJ.
The level of instruction is excellent.
Paulo whose credentials speak for themselves truly has time for every parent and student.
Adam is a great instructor and loves teaching kids in Jiu-Jitsu and how to apply the disciplines in every day life.
Dillon who teaches my Grandson private lessons is awesome, he has really turned him around as a fighter, Thanks Dillon .
Jesus is an excellent Muay Thai  instructor and he just loves what he does. He’s great with the kids as well, he has a way of energizing his kids.
Rolly head boxing instructor and his staff provide excellence in the art of boxing.
Rolly is one of the nicest guys you will ever meet coupled with his teaching ability is a combination that can’t be beat, Rolly offers classes in boxing fit as well as physical fitness in general,
Sensei Walter is a red belt Judokan practitioner one of very few in the Country let alone in the State.’He works with the kids in the art of Judo, providing them with the highest level of training they can get in the Country let alone the County.

We in the North County area are fortunate to have SDBJJ here,
I could not recommend it any higher.
If you think that’s all it’s not, wait until you see the new faculty that they have recently purchased. State of the Art due to open somewhere around the first of the year,
This all shows Paulo’s commitment to the sport and to bringing the finest MMA style gym to North County.
If your thinking about any of these disciplines as something you interested in then you owe to yourself to check this gym out.
I must give a shout out to Paulo and his Staff,
Thanks for everything guys.<//Review>

I recently signed up with SDBJJ and by far was impressed by the ongoing experience. My first day of class was extremely enjoyable! Greeted by all and trained by many , which in my opinion is great because you get to learn from all different skill levels ( Shout out to Jesus). The atmosphere is peaceful with a friendly environment which made it welcoming to me. I hope to learn much more from this place and would recommend it to anybody.< /review>

My son loves the working out at San Diego Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu!  This was his first foray into martial arts and we are sure we picked the right style and location.  Watching the kids wrestle around on the ground in a safe environment and learning the techniques that will help them defend and safely control the spaces around them is so satisfying as a parent.  The teachers are really paying attention to each student and offering a caring, compassionate, disciplined environment.  Paulo and his team are really great at what they do!< /text>

We signed our entire family up for the "Studio Brazil / Functional Fitness" program in anticipation of the summer beach season.  Our trainer (Jesus) has pushed us to a level of fitness that we have never experienced before.

We are seeing results in other sports due to the programs focus on functional strength and are really happy with the overall change we are seeing physically.

If you don't have the money for a personal trainer and you are looking for something that is similar to crossfit but more affordable and sport specific, I would suggest checking them out.< /Text>

I’ve met leaders in my life who I’ve followed because I had to, and ones who I’ll follow because I want to. Professor Fernando is someone I look forward to training under as long as I possibly can. Jesus is a great Muay Thai instructor with an apparent desire to teach people his craft. I’m a better person because of knowing these men. Hats off to everyone involved with this gym. See you all on the mats. Osss<//Review>

This place has litterally changed my life, although I am an employee here, I was not always one. I started here in 2005 as a 19 year old student who was interested in martial arts classes. Through this place I have had many mentors and received solid advice from the many great people who were part of this family over the years.  Through the support of people like this I was able to achieve things in my life that I didnt think I was capable of.</text>

<Text>I don't train here, but my boyfriend David does.  He has been coming here since 2007, but in 2007 we had to move up near Yosemite National Park so David had to say goodbye to his second family with a heavy heart.  We have family in San Diego and the very first stop once we enter San Diego is this fantastic place!!!!! It is amazing to see and experience David's face light up when he talks about Paulo and everyone he trains with! I didn't really know Paulo, but hearing David talk about him and the school makes me feel like I know him.  Paulo, his wife, and everyone apart of the SDBJJ family is so welcoming and encouraging!!!! I have trained a little MMA up here where we live, but I think our next trip to San Diego I will participate in a few classes!!!! I highly recommend this place to everyone of all ages male and female!!!! I promise you won't regret your decision, and you'll gain so much both physically and mentally!< /Text>< rating>

<review>Great experience! My 4 year old can be a little shy in group classes but Paolo is a natural. My son felt very comfortable and was able to participate for the entire hour without running to me. And he had a lot of fun!</review>< Rate>

This place is amazing.  There are no other words.  The teachers, the other parents, the kids, everything is wonderful.  Sensei Adam told me our first day that they teach these kids integrity and that has been something that has really stuck with me.  Sensei Dillon is the most incredible teacher for these young kids/toddlers.  My son has the best time in his classes and does two classes a day, 5 days a week. I love the behavioral improvement I’m already seeing in my almost 4 year old and I’m so thrilled to see him grow within this organization and become a respectful and kind young man.  I couldn’t imagine better role models for my son than Paulo, Adam & Dillon! Thank you SDBJJ!<//Text>

< Review>
I don't normally write many reviews, but I felt that SDBJJ deserves much praise from me, and my family. My son was not even 5 years old when we stumbled onto the Academy. I knew nothing about mixed martial arts, but my boy needed an outlet. I read a few reviews, spoke to Paulo on the phone and decided to check it out. I was so impressed by the coaching staff's ability to teach all ages, while maintaining an air of FUN, that I had to sign my son up. The changes I have seen in him just after a few months have been significant, and I honestly feel I owe it to SDBJJ.

The friends I have met there will all say the same thing: SDBJJ has changed my child for the better, and I'm so happy I found this place.<//Review>

Our 6 year old son has been coming to SDBJJ for about 6 months now and we could not be happier with our decision to enroll him here.  The gym is clean and much larger than any other studio we have come across.  What truly makes the learning experience incredible are the dedicated senseis that show up everyday.  They are patient, dedicated, experienced and engaging all at the same time.  We love SDBJJ!!!</review>

Paulo is amazing! I was looking to get back into shape in a class environment and this studio has by far exceeded my expectations. I was introduced to the gym by my coworker and Paulo has taken me in like one of his own. I have made soo many friends, strength, and respect for the sport at SDBJJ. I am eager to get to practice everyday! Join the gym, I'll see you on the mat!</Review>

We've been there less than a year and I would recommend this gym to anyone whose ever thought of trying judo or jiu-jitsu. If you have younger children, head instructor/owner Paulo Fernando and his staff are amazing with young athletes. You won't be disappointed!!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Yesterday was my first day of Jiu-jitsu.  I was slightly intimidated that I was going to show up and get ass kicked.  However, it was completely the opposite experience.  I was kindly greeted and given a tour by Paulo (owner), and was introduced to everyone there.  During the class, everyone was helpful, supportive, and encouraging.  Even at the end of the class we all shook hands with one another, with a smile.  Perfect experience and I look forward to progressing with them.< /review>

At first I was very apprehensive about taking Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, because I had no prior martial arts background/experience. Paulo and Adam, as well as the rest of the academy made me feel right at home. Everyone here is so friendly and inviting, the instruction is top notch and you definitely feel a sense of family and community here. If you're looking to take bjj, make new friends, and learn how to protect yourself then you can't go wrong here!< /text>

<Review>As a female, I was very scared entering the world of BJJ, especially since it is mostly male dominated. But i absolutely love this gym.
Paulo makes the women feel comfortable and everyone treats we with equality. Everyones in class wants you to improve.

I call this place my home and I never want to leave. I have been here for a little more than a year and I love it.
I am there almost everyday and i see improvement in myself. Not only in my jiu jitsu/judo, but also in my self confidence and overall happiness.
Paulo makes this gym a family environment and I encourage more women to try this place.< /Review>< user>

I started training at San Diego Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu in 2007. I have explored other dojo's both locally and across multiple states. I have yet to find a sensei who genuinely cares more for his students and their families than Paulo does. His experience in both Jiu-jitsu and Judo is second to none. He also offers Muay Thai classes among others. If you're seeking a place for your child to safely learn self defense, balance, respect then search no further. The diversity of the students within each class is also an amazing thing. You won't feel over whelmed as a new student and there is also plenty of people to challenge you if that's your thing. Everyone there is always willing to help in literally every aspect you can think of. I've seen professional fighters come to take classes and learn something new, military personnel, nutritionist, etc. I currently live just outside Yosemite National Park and took it upon myself to drive the 5.5 hour long drive just to take a few classes and be surrounded with my 2nd family. Thank you so much Paulo for all of your teachings. Not only on the mat but as a person as well. You have always been my sensei and will forever be regardless of how far away I live. I will see you soon! Oos</Review>

SDBJJ is awesome!!! SDBJJ is a great place to train, the staff is great, friendly and always willing to help you out. Its place for the whole family to come and train. I recently returned to train again at SDBJJ and there is no other place I would rather train at. I am really excited to return to SDBJJ...All the instructors take the time with their students no matter if you are a beginner or advanced.<//review>

<Review>I've been a student here for almost four years.  When you step into the dojo you are immediately welcomed by Sensei Paulo, Sensei Adam, Katia, Jesus or one of the staff.  This is the place where you can comfortably learn the martial arts in a focused, family friendly environment.  If you are a beginner, it won't take long for you to see that this is not a macho, testosterone driven, "knuckle dragger" environment full of bolstered egos.  You will be brought into the fold and given the appropriate attention so you can quickly learn the basics in order to move forward in the arts.  If you are an intermediate or experienced practitioner, you will be challenged with players of all levels.  Sparring competition is intense with focus on learning and safety at all times.  Respect for your partners in this aspect is a must and part of the beauty of the discipline of the arts.

This place is great for the kiddos too!  The kids program is excellent.  I have two young boys and judo and jiu jitsu has helped them gain confidence and coordination.  For moms and dads worried about turning their kids into bullies, I can tell you that you can expect quite the opposite.  The arts are not taught for this purpose and your kids will learn to respect others.

For the ladies out there, be assured that you are absolutely welcome here too!  There are many women involved in Muay Thai, Jiu Jitsu and Judo.  Respect is given to all students and the women are no exception.  This is a safe environment for all.

I don't personally take part in the Studio Brazil workouts or Muay Thai but I have seen and spoken to those that do.  All that I have spoken too are very satisfied with the experience and the workouts.  They work hard and it shows.

So get in here and become part of the experience, the arts, and the SDBJJ family!

Beware of this business !! Paulo Augusto is a piece of work.He can twist any story, accuse you ,call you names and threaten you with the anger that can not be described over 15-20$.He could be very polite ,and understanding and next thing you know  he can be pointing finger at you not even willing to understand the facts.Even if you provide good service for him he still would not be grateful and just get mad , and trying to find other reasons for more accusations .Stay away of direct business with this guy.<//text>

< review>
Just took my first day here. I used to train at a very reputable gym down in Miramar, but I live in Escondido and the commute there was an issue I would like to avoid. I used to train 2 years ago but am very picky on where I'm going to invest my time, health, and money into a gym membership. For the past 3 weeks I have been taking free trial classes all over San Diego county. Mostly NORTH San Diego County. Now let me tell you, ALL the decent gyms are down in San Diego. In North County there are literally none. There was one gym in Oceanside that I liked but again, I wanted to avoid a long commute. San Diego Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu & Mixed Martial Arts to me, is THE ONLY amazing gym in Northeast San Diego County, maybe even in the entire north county. I have been looking for an emphasis on technique for Muay Thai, Jiu-Jitsu, and Judo. A lot of other gyms will focus more on "fitness". The programs incorporate both. Exactly what I wanted. If I wanted to go to a gym that focuses on fitness, I might as well go to a generic LA Fitness or 24 hour gym.

Now let's discuss my first day here. It is located in San Marcos which is a relatively safe city. I walked in to a beautifully spacious establishment and most of all....SANITARY AND CLEAN. I walked down to the morning Muay Thai class and was invited by friendly students and most of all a friendly coach. The students and coach automatically pushed me and motivated me to the point where I automatically felt the family oriented vibes the gym emits. We warmed up, and being out of shape for 2 years, they kept pushing me with positive remarks. After we started to work on technique and Jesus, the coach, was thorough and very hands on working with us. When class was done, it ended with positivity and embedded an amazing first impression into my brain. I knew that this gym was the one.

The owner, is big time. He is highly certified and has so much experience under his belt for Judo and BJJ that it's overwhelming. He still competes to! The gym has been one of the most longest standing gyms in San Diego. They're doing something right. I initially came for the Muay Thai classes but it looks like I will be committing to Jiu-Jitsu and Judo just as much as my love for striking.

If you are a picky student looking for technique and fitness. Your gym is here.</review>

I couldn't find a better place and environment for my daughter to be at. I can't wait for my two boys to be old enough so I can enroll them at the school. I would recommend SDBJJ ACADEMY for any parent willing to have the kids well trained in Brazilian JiuJitsu and Judo. Thanks Sensei Paulo for everything.< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>This academy is nothing short of amazing. I have been with Sensei Paulo for 4 years now. Starting out with the fundamentals all the way to advance techniques, Sensei Paulo is a master of them all. SDBJJ has been my home away from home and where I go to get away. The instruction there is nothing short of world class. Sensei Adam is also a book of knowledge. His passion and love for all things grappling shows every time he steps on the mat. I am honored to be apart of such a great legacy of Jiu Jitsu practitioners.</Review>< Pictures>

Jiu Jitsu with Paulo and his team at San Diego Brazilian Jiu Jitsu has been a life changing experience for me. I am so happy to have found a positive and inspiring school where I constantly learn and improve my jiu jitsu game as well as my life. I am thankful to be a part of a great group of people who help each other every day, and to practice in such a nice facility with great teachers.< /Review>

SDBJJ & SBFF are truly first class.  It is first and foremost, a great family atmosphere where everyone is welcome.  World class instruction in a fun and family-first school.  The facilities are second to none, with spring loaded mats TRX equipment, stationary bikes etc.  I can't say enough good things about both SDBJJ & SBFF, try them out and see why they're the best!<//Review>

<Review>SDBJJ is a great school for mixed martial arts.  From the opinion of a person new to BJJ, this school has everything needed in order to train.  There is a flexible schedule with morning, afternoon, and evening classes to include classes on the weekends.  The school has several types of martial arts and fitness classes but the BJJ classes are what attracts the most students.  The training area for BJJ is huge with more than enough room to run around and train without having to worry about constantly bumping into other people.  I've seen other gyms around San Diego and most of them appear to be much smaller in size.  The facility has huge bay doors which open up and allow for air circulation.  And every BJJ class always has a wide variety of experience levels which helps whether you have been training for your first time or have been training for years.< /Review>< Name>

Great family environment! Proof? I've had my son and daughter train here since they were six and seven and they are now 17 and 16. When I'm  not around the other blackbelts watch over them as if they were their kids. I wouldn't trust anyone else with my family.
Paulo is the root structure of Jiu Jitsu in San Diego County with over 30 years in the sport of Judo and Jiu-jitsu actively participating and not speculating.
As far as the adult side of training I've been training here for 10 years and am continually being challenged physically and mentally. So if you want an academy that brings the best out of you physically and spiritually then this is your new home and welcome to the family.</Review>

SDBJJ is an outstanding place to learn BJJ, Judo, Muay Thai, and Boxing.  Sensei Paulo is an incredibly skilled practitioner.  He's an even better instructor.  In fact, all of his certified instructors are outstanding instructors.  My son has been training with Paulo for over 2 years, and my son's success in BJJ and Judo has helped him become better at all the things he does, including academics and club sports.

I've been training in various martial arts for over 30 years.  To date, San Diego Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Academy is the best facility I've ever trained at.  Being that I'm a disabled veteran, I have some serious medical issues.  Despite my limitations, Paulo and the other instructors at SDBJJ have worked with me in order to help develop my skills.  Regardless of your current level of conditioning or physical limitations, SDBJJ can help you develop as a martial artist.

If you decide to train with us at SDBJJ Academy, you won't be disappointed!<//review>

I started my Bjj career at SDBJJ, 8-10 years ago.  I needed to release my frustrations of everyday life as well
as manage my PTSD. I was gaining weight and after watching a UFC fight in TV, I looked at my wife and told her that I used to do judo as a kid!  That's when it clicked and looked up Bjj schools near my home(at the time). I found SDBJJ online and drove there, a few days after Christmas.  I called Sensei paulo, which he and Sendei Andrew where returning from snowboarding, they met me at the school and the rest is history!
SDBJJ, is my Bjj home! I have trained at other schools and none;zero; nada, hold a candle to SDBJJ and its students. They are a family, they train together and hangout together outside of the school.
I now own a martial arts school in Santa Maria, Ca-4.5 hours north of SD, paulo will tell you 7-we are affiliated with SDBJJ, and I'm one of Sensei Paulo's black belts! I've worked really hard to mirror my school after SDBJJ! We go down there to train and have always been greeted with open arms.
No other school is like SDBJJ; no other school has the same drive as SDBJJ...none! Call them asap, get signed up and start training. If not for you than get your kids, wife, mother, brother, sister, he'll even your grandmother, to train under the best martial arts instructor in SD.

i've been training at sdbjj for about four years now and I love this academy, it is very clean and everybody is very friendly and willing to help improve your game, I would highly recommend this school to anyone. 4000 square feet spring loaded floor makes the difference. we are the only bjj school that offer high quality Judo and Brazilian jiu-jitsu at the same place. sensei Paulo Fernando holds a 5th degree black belt in bjj and a 5th degree black belt in judo as well. you should come and try our school. best in San Diego county<//Text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Awesomeness- The stylist Mayra was so sweet and she explained what and how she was going to do to my Daughter's hair. She and the other stylist made the visit so fun and even loving. Mayra was so sweet and my daughter Ariayana wasn't even crying like she would. Perfect with kid's. If you need a kid's hair cut this is the place to go, ask for Mayra, she's there on Tuesdays and weekends. 5 Star's.</Text>< pictures>

Horrible customer service! I made an appointment with a hair stylist and she decided to call last minute and cancel saying " she didn't have enough time!" Absolutely unprofessional. I cleared my whole day for my appointment and have a very important event to attend this weekend! Beware!< /Text>

<user_name>14o1 Chan<//user_name><Review>Went in before 7:00 PM, was ignored and (despite the closing time being listed as 7:30 PM) was never told they were apparently closing early. One of the two ladies that was working here finally walks over to me, only to reach over my head and turn off the Open sign whilst muttering "I'm gonna start cleaning up" without saying anything else. So I just got up and left... And will never look back.< /Review>< userid>

<Time>1498166629266<//Time><review>Ever since Jeff left this place was never the same. I used to come here specifically for Jeff because he cared about his work he cared about keeping his customers happy. Never once did we have problems and he always greeted us with a smile and made us feel welcome.

However, since he left I tried to test the waters with the girls that work here and see their "expertise." And might I say, that I will never make that mistake again. On 2 separate occasions 1 for my senior photos and the second at my sister's college graduation.

My senior photos were later in the day so I went in just before noon to get my hair cut. I didn't want anything special just the usual.  1 on the sides scissors on top. Easy right? Nope. They butchered my hair they left bald spots in the back without even telling me, showing me, or even warning me. I didn't get so much as an apology until the next day after my photos. After my family kept asking me what happened? I didn't know what they had done to my hair until after my family took a picture of the back and showed me. And the next day when I confronted them they said "I'm sorry you didn't know you had bald spots." I was 17.  And months later it grew back yes. me and my family were outraged but they still claimed they were innocent and it wasn't their fault.

2nd story I will make shorter since this fist one was long enough but same type of thing happened. I go in and try to get the same exact cut with someone else. They butcher my hair again to the point where I have to go to a different hair salon to fix it making me late to my sister's graduation.

I'm sorry but the staff need to go back to school and relearn their material because they will lose a lot of customers if they don't know what they are doing.

If Jeff was here then I would give more stars but this Fantastic Sams lost their only star worker.</review>< pictures>

Today I went into The fantastic Sams salon on Iris in Moreno Valley ask for a pixie cut and lit was a simple cut. She butchered up my hair round the ears left both sides half bald. That older lady should not cut hair.This was the 1st and last with that lady. I have gone their few times before and no problem. Never ever will I go back. I had to have it fix by a barber. 🤬😡🤯😤I’m mean it’s was BUTCHERED<//review>

<Text>My husband said this place was good since he gets his haircut here, and the stylist he goes to says they also do kids haircuts. We decided to take our almost 1 year old this morning and right away the stylist there (looked to be Hispanic with short hair) was not friendly at all. Don’t go to this place for your kids haircut. They don’t offer a seat for the baby to secure him, they expect you as the parent to sit with him, even though he’s terrified and fighting to get out of your arms. Plus the stylist had no sympathy for him and was barely any kind of comfort to me or the baby. Hire people that actually smile and are good with kids. And get a damn booster seat or something to accommodate toddlers who might not be having the best day. We will continue to go ANYWHERE ELSE for his haircut since the 1st time we went (to a separate haircut place), the stylists there knew what they were doing and were able to handle it. Screw this place, my poor son was so scared and this woman didn’t even try to comfort him.< /Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
If I could give this establishment a zero I would be the first customer to do so. As i arrived in a Sunday morning the ladies were not welcoming at all and were very rude. I  went I  for a haircut and retouch on my highlights.  I show the stylist a picture of how my highlights were and how I want them to look. She reassures that it can be done the way I want them.  A few hours after I got my hair done when I am home I get to examine the work the stylist in a better setting. I see some areas orange and did not match  my original highlights. My haircut is a disaster the whole job was a mess.  I  contact the manager when I notice the mistakes and she was rude and wanted me to go in that same day, while I can't do to the fact that I have two little kids.  Her rudeness led me to file a complaint to corporate, because I don't need to be going several times in a week to get it done right. If I paid for the service and if it was not good I have the right to complain.  So I go in the week day i  in hope of trying to get it situation fixed while when i ask for the stylist the owner gets nasty with me and starts urging with me in front of customers and stating that if I don't have time to go in several times a week to fix my hair (that they messed up) that I shouldn't be getting highlights. I even mentioned to her how she is being unprofessional and her exact words were I Don't care! What owner does that! She has no respect for customers and that is just sad because we the customers are the ones who keep her doors open. She refused to give me a refund and when I tired to resolve the situation she just simply hung up on me so unprofessional and childish.<//Review>

<text>Made me wait an extra 30 minutes because I didn't sign in, and there was nobody ahead of me. No one told me I had to sign in. Barely got someone to greet me after standing at the desk till they acknowledge me, even then they did not ask me to sign in.< /text><user_id>107825329795249918376<//user_id>< Time>

< Review>
First and last time here. We waited 20-25mins. My stylist made several rude comments about my child's hair. I offered a picture of the cut I wanted which she only glanced at and the proceeded to butcher his haircut. It looked nothing like the pic. If the service had been good I wouldn't have minded the wait. If you go here then you should steer clear of carla.</Review>

My mom experienced the worst customer service ever the hairstylist was telling my mom that her hair was  dead in front of all these other clients and hairstylists.That hairstylist that was working on my mom's hair was giving my mom attitude and pulling her hair telling her it's tangled .my mom had just done a chemical service on her hair ,it's obvious it's going to be damaged.The stylist should have wet it with warm water and deep conditioned it before doing her hair.  My mom new walking in she had damaged hair from the chemical service and For her to make my mom feel ugly and embarrassed by speaking loud about her hair that's rude!!! so today I came in to try to talk to the manager about this situation. I ended up talking to an assistant manager asking her if she can talk to me after she's done with this client a men's haircut which shouldn't take that long. I waited then right in front of me that assistant manager takes the next client so I left  my number on the sign in appointment sheet with a message saying to call me  and a lil note saying it's for the manager.Nope no one has called!!! I  was being nice to try to not write a review they did this to themselves basically it's more than one person that's rude. This concludes my presentation ✌🏼
Oh and it's 0 star I just put one cause it's the least I can give.i'm sure other people have had great experiences but for her to walk in and have a bad experience and I walk in two days after and have a bad experience with a different person.… Also her name is CAROL</Text>

< Review>
We can't hardly stand online shopping and we were so glad to be able to safely (Covid) browse in their great Woodland Hills showroom. We quickly connected with Diana, who was super friendly, fun and very helpful. The salespeople's style there is great. They let you know they are there, check in once in a while,  but don't hover over us while looking at furniture and art. We love their furniture designs and prices. Really good shopping experience.< /Review>

Spent a lot of time at the Woodland Hills store after buying my first home...I needed more furniture and have always liked this place , even back when it was still called Plumers. Great furniture , good prices and great service from Diana . She was great every step of the way . The only thing preventing me from giving the place 5 stars is their delivery service had some mishaps. Which Diana did her best to resolve.< /Review>

<review>Having one of their leather sofas pop up on my feed was odd, but after following the link, being enticed by the look and price we went and visited.  The cognac, buttery soft leather is exactly what we have been looking for and at an amazing price.  While there I fell in love with a home office furniture suite and grabbed that too.  The furniture was delivered within 2 weeks, properly set up and assembled (office).  Everything in our experience was fantastic from sales to delivery and assembly.  We are impressed!</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

"Heidi at the Woodland Hills store provided exceptional service. I was so pleased when she called 2 weeks later saying there was a mistake in billing and we are due $1,000 back. The installers were true professionals and accommodating to changes in placement we had after some pieces were installed, and the furniture itself is functional, sturdy and beautiful. We did 3 purchases so far. 2 from the store and one online and everything went well and smooth. I highly recommend your products and services. Thanks!</text>

<Review>Scandinavian Designs in Woodland Hills has a nice selection of modern furniture for your home and office. Their prices aren't too crazy high like West Elm, Restoration Hardware or Arhaus. Bought a leather reclining couch that looks very nice and modern. Will def be back to purchase an office desk, chair, and more! The Sales Associates don't pressure you or follow you throughout the store...they give personal space.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I worked with Heidi and Gordon who are wonderful. Diana, who also works there even knows my name as I come in quite often. Everyone has been wonderful to work with.
I actually bought the complete black Julian Living room couch, chair and ottoman from Heidi.  I came in every day to visualize it being in my Living Room and after one week did purchase.

Fun place, lovely furniture and no doubt I’ll be in this week to see what else I should purchase 😊</Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80c29c1ff2035187:0x19b9c926ff16f051</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

< review>
The quality, sleek style, and price of the furniture at Scandinavian Designs has had us coming back for years. We recently were looking for a new bedroom set and looked at all of the major furniture stores, but none compared to Scandinavian Designs as we kept coming back to their selections. Their furniture is sophisticated, functional, and beautifully designed. Great customer service - Diana was extremely helpful and friendly. She always remembered us and followed up with us on our order. The delivery company was careful, fast, and efficient - plus they set everything up perfectly and additionally disposed of all of the packing materials. When looking for a new bedroom set we felt that we had to sacrifice either quality, price, or style to find a mid-century modern bedroom set, but at Scandinavian Designs, we found multiple items that went above and beyond our expectations.< /review>

<date>1557334675629</date><name>Maurice Abikzer<//name><Review>ordered most of my house furniture from them, first delivery was pushed one week after the date of delivery, when they delivered, items were missing and they brought the wrong items. After they delivered the right items i went back to pick some more staff for the house a month later, they promised that this time the delivery will happen with no incident... Sure enough out of all what i ordered which was a large order, they brought 2 items and the reason was according to the delivery driver thats all they gave him. Long story short they gave me a bunch of bogus excuses which i did not buy. The delivery company they use is the worse i have ever experienced, drivers smoking while delivering, their appearance far from being professional, they look that they were picked up from the street corner. They have nice stuff with decent prices but their method of delivery is a total disaster. The manager they have by the name of Marina is a very professional and very sweet person, i felt bad for her as she was so sorry and kept apologizing for the mess and asked me to reconsider canceling the entire order but i had to cancel as i would not trust their company with keeping the order and have it delivered the right way on a later date. Its a shame because they have nice things but a real shake up needs to happen on the warehouses and the delivery company.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I really liked my sales associate Sarah. She was friendly and knowledgable. Jane also was very helpful. She located the chair I wanted at other store location and had it shipped to Woodland Hills. The fabric was discontinued. I love my new living room furniture.</review>

<review>Came here on a Tuesday night for Karaoke and it was loads of fun. The DJ was great and fair with his song rotation. There were plenty of people, all of which provided for a fantastic karaoke atmostphere. Didn't see a food menu, but i asked the bartender for a rye and ginger and I'm pretty sure I got a rye and gin. Great karaoke bar!<//review>< Rating>

A security guard aggressively came into the bathroom while I was still using it, then had his croney carry me out via choke hold when I yelled at him. Don't go here unless you're into invasion of privacy and power tripping security.</Text>

The Alley accommodated us for my friend's bachelorette party on a Saturday night. They let us come in when they opened (6pm) and decorate for the party to reserve our location by the dance floor and live band. They also let us keep our cupcakes in the fridge. We arrived at 9pm where everyone from the bouncer to the bartenders made us feel very special since it was the bride-to-be's special night! At the end of the night the bride was hungry and they (the waitress and bouncer) offered to walk next door to pick up a pizza we ordered, HOW kind and seriously above and beyond it was. They went out of their way to make us all feel special and welcomed. The music was awesome, and we liked how they had the live band but then also played dancing music in between too. I would recommend going here to anyone! Thank you for the great service!< /review>

My experience with Tracy has been outstanding. I have worked with her on 2 deals so far and she is fantastic. Extremely helpful throughout the process and always has a positive attitude to any problems that may arise. Whenever I needed questions answered, she is very quick to respond and help me out. Can't wait to work on more deals with Tracy.<//text>

If I could give Tracy Bolen more stars, I would!  She really and truly went above and beyond for us...I think she stressed out more when things didn't go smoothly than we did!  Through NO FAULT OF HER OWN, our process had some bumps and dips due to different state issues and other things, but she went to bat for us all the way through it and we communicated every step of the way.  She was truly a pleasure to work with!< /Review>

<review>I highly recommend Kevin based on three things that I love about him and have helped me personally. Kevin is knowledgeable, honest and caring. What I am going to share with you about him, also extends to his team and his company, but I am going to focus on him here.

Knowledgeable: Kevin is passionate about his job, and that energizes him to remain up-to-date and informed about any opportunities or challenges that your loan may encounter, and he confidently and calmly plans and guides you accordingly. He does not speculate when there are unknowns, but he and his team investigate on your behalf, and provide you with the facts. This quickly translated into trust between us when we began working together which allowed me to follow his guidelines efficiently.

Honest: Kevin does not exaggerate or downplay, but he informs you. That for me is always a sign of the respect that a person extends to you. Tell me the truth, and let me decide what it means, right? He gets it naturally. Kevin is punctual for the things that he can control, and is great in communicating what to expect for the things that he cannot control (oh those meticulous underwriters!) Also, Kevin takes responsibility when there are any mistakes on his side. Our first interaction that won me over was how he handled my complaint about a misunderstanding involving people who worked under him. He listened patiently, explained his opinions and addressed the issue to my satisfaction. I felt zero defensive tone in his words and action. I was truly impressed.

Caring: Kevin is a caring man. He is personable. He is interested in you and your stories. He remembers what you care for and what you are concerned about even if you lose touch with him for months. I enjoy my calls with him and probably take too much of his time with my stories but he is kind of a man who is genuinely interested in you and your dreams. When you cross the finish line, you feel that he is genuinely cheering for your success, and if there is a stressful moment in the process you feel he is beside you and not on the other side of the table shrugging his shoulders.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Absolutely not. We were delayed closing on our house by 3 weeks because he didn’t have any sense of urgency. Instead of 6 weeks, we closed in 9 weeks and we were very close to losing our house because of it. Simple papers to sign that would have taken 2 seconds to email were sent weeks later and that contributed to the delays. He didn’t communicate throughout this process at all. We had no idea where we were and what needed to be done because he couldn’t send a quick email of “hey, I need these statements”. Statements that were sent instantly as soon as I knew he needed them. He didn’t do his due diligence when it came to verifying what type of property we were purchasing and therefor we lost a loan because they don’t loan to a rural property. This also contributed to the massive delay. I emailed him regarding a serious matter, and he never emailed me back because he had no idea that we were even going to go with the credit union that sent me information to sign! Spoiler alert- I didn’t mess up, but it would have been nice to get a response to know that I didn’t just financially ruin myself.

I have a very long list of why you should never work with Shawn, those are just a few.

If you want communication and you want to close on time, don’t work with him.

On a positive note, we closed and received our keys on Christmas Eve.</Text>

We had a very pleasant experience working with Jodi FIscher and her team getting our mortgage.  Our situation was very complicated and Jodi used her experience to advise us and get us through the process.  We would definitely use Jodi again and would recommend her for our friends and family for any of their future mortgage needs.<//Review>

< Review>
As a first-time homebuyer, I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. Emelia Marini with American Pacific Mortgage made the whole process extremely easy and enjoyable. She was patient, calm, and took the time to explain even the smallest details so I could feel confident in my decisions.  I was pleasantly surprised by her quick responses to emails and texts, as well as her willingness to talk me through different processes on the phone. When my bank put up a small roadblock, Emelia was able to come up with several solutions to keep the ball rolling and not delay closing. I have already recommended her to friends and will continue to do so in the future.<//Review>

You won’t find a better lender than Dave Barton. We have done 5+ loans/refinances with him over the years and would never go with anyone else. He is very thorough, easy to communicate with, never misses a deadline, and keeps you in the loop about everything. He is great with following up, gets back to you very quickly if he’s not immediately available. I like that he gives us the conservative, worst-case scenario, so we have been pleasantly surprised when our payment always ends up being less than projected instead of more. He is very up front about all fees, and is willing to explain anything in terms you can understand. He is your guy!!< /review>

<Review>This is my third personal transaction with American Pacific Mortgage in addition to countless business transactions I have done with APM in my capacity as a real estate agent. The process was seamless. Laura and her team went above and beyond to ensure we received the best rate and payment on our refinance.

<review>American Pacific Mortgage seem to only employ top talent!! I have done loans through APM for new homes and investment properties, as well as refis in both CA and TX. Tony Close was my rockstar loan officer for the CA loans and for TX I had the awesome team of Connor Pollock and Jenny Patricio. Their professionalism, efficiency and responsiveness was unparalleled. Attention to detail is critical in lending, to avoid delays, set backs and frustration. I have purchased 10 properties throughout the years and poor lenders/brokers can make the experience so stressful/dreadful. My transactions with these individuals at APM made the process easy and even perhaps enjoyable :-); I would highly recommend them to make home buying a bit less stressful as they are on top of their game at all times, super friendly and even bring a bit of humor to the crazy lending process.<//review>< Pics>

<Text>I worked closely with John Gremm and Chuck Jarrad III in getting our mortgage application approved by the VA and American Pacific Mortgage.
Their quick response to any questions or issues I raised was extremely helpful in leading us through the process, including all of the extra requirements of VA paperwork.  When I called John for assistance, he either picked up the phone immediately or called back within a few minutes.  APM provided excellent customer service throughout the process and the closing actually happened on schedule and without any complications.  I strongly recommend APM, Chuck, and John to guide current home owners and new buyers through the new mortgage process or a re-finance of their existing home.  No other company has been this helpful and professional in meeting our refinancing needs.  I respect and trust both of them, and thank them for their help.<//Text><gmapID>0x809ae77d9c8ff043:0x3ab43459f95be68e</gmapID><Name>John Brady</Name>< userid>

<text>Where do I start!? From the very beginning they have the MOST helpful with the mortgage and home buying process. Being a first time home buyer I naturally reached out to my own credit union and other local banks to no avail and very little help and direction. I ended up getting connected with American Pacific Mortgage and the loan originator Ms Wendy and everything began to fall in place! She gave us a realistic loan approval and explained our options. From the beginning to the very last day (signing day) she helped us with every step. Always within a phone calls reach. Always willing to help and guide us. She did a terrific job educating us on our options and really made us feel comfortable with the home buying process. If you are in need of a mortgage loan, this is definitely the place! They are honest direct and most of all helpful with the process. No unnecessary fees tacked on to the loan which was a major plus! Thanks again For all of your help! I’ll be back when it time to buy another one!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Nidia helped my family with our first home purchase.  She was professional and  knowledgeable about the different loan scenarios available to us.  She was a great communicator, always available for questions and was efficient answering them ALL.  Our loans closed smoothly and on schedule. She was able to get us a great rate and we couldn’t be happier with the experience. I would recommend Nidia  for all your home loan needs.< /review>

I highly recommend Preferred Rate. I was in the middle of refinancing my mortgage with my lender when I had a question. They came highly recommended by not one, but two of my friends - and I see why.

Richard Hanover and his team were able to get me a much lower rate than I was being offered by other lenders. He also explained to me how I could drop my PMI if I brought a little extra money to closing - which is going to allow me to save quite a bit of money over the next few years. My previous lender didn’t even mention this option during the process.

I’ve bought a few homes before and I’ve refinanced once before, but the process was easier and quicker than any of the other times. And they went out of their way to make sure I had a really good experience.

I can’t recommend Richard and his team enough. I really appreciate all the work they put in on my behalf.<//text>

<Text>We worked with Jose Menendez, and he is the most experience loan officer I’ve ever meat. From the beginning of the process of getting qualified to the day we closed, he was always responsive on any questions or concerns. He was also extremely careful to give us the best Loan and rate possibly for our needs. Look no farther if you like professionalism, experience, and extremely good communication.

<resp>None<//resp><text>I owe a lot to this company and their team.  I was going through a divorce, in Forebearance on my previous mortgage and trying to fix my credit.  Alan Plat was my loan officer helping me with my refinance.  But before I go into this Phillip was the person that I watched on youtube that helped me to realize that their was hope for me in the storm I was in.  Many companies said they could not help me while I was in Forbearance but American Funding reached out to me.  They looked at my financial situation and gave me an honest opinion on what I needed to do to get my house refinanced.  They help me get my credit fixed,  pay off debt, and also gave me a path going forward to make sure I am never in this situation again.  I can’t thank then enough for the help they gave me.  If you or anyone you know is wanting to find a way out of a financial storm and to get your house refinanced.  Please contact this company.  They have my highest recommendation and respect.  As I am a veteran who just retired right at the begin of COVID and no one was hiring.  This company was patient with me and once I was able to find employment helped me get back on track while ensure the refinance process was smooth.  They even found a lien that had been placed on the house due to divorce mess.  Thank you for everything.  And when I refinance again this will be the company I use.  10 stars.<//text><time>1618091933946<//time></record>

<review>Second time refinancing in one year with APM and nothing but good things to say. Kristi is amazingly responsive and patient, and Tracy is so prompt and efficient with paperwork. The rate is incredibly, but the most impressive thing is how low the closing costs are. Less than half of what we were quoted from American Financing< /review></record>

Chuck, Art and the rest of the APM team were GREAT.   Chuck went above and beyond my expectations to make the process as smooth as possible with a focus on customer service. I had a lot of questions and “favors” to try to keep my escrow within a certain budget and timeline.  Chuck made it happen with no pressure and no rushing while still capturing all of the details.   Thanks Chuck!<//review>

With this last remortgage, we were not only able to make our monthly payments lower, but also shortened the length of the loan overall. Paul is very thorough and walks us through the process, explaining everything clearly and in a way that makes me feel comfortable asking any questions I may have. I HIGHLY recommend working with him and often give his contact info to anyone I know looking to buy a house. I honestly wouldn’t trust anyone else with it.<//text>< Pics>

APM and Justin Hahn were great to work with. My realtor in South Carolina was worried because it wasn't one of the local companies she'd worked with before, but APM proved her fears unfounded. The process was seamless, Justin kept me on top of time sensitive items, and I ended up with a great interest rate. Overall a great experience!<//Text>

I was able to take advantage of lower interest rates with a refinance of our mortgage, and get cash out to do a basement remodeling project.  Something good came out of 2020.  Bob Bless and his team guided me through the process and helped me get exactly what I wanted.  Rates are at historic lows, and this could be a good opportunity for you too.<//Text>

<text>I cannot recommend Jose Menendez and his team enough! When we first purchased our home a few years back Jose took care of us. Now, with these record low interest rates we decided to refinance. I contacted Jose and he was on it. He found us a great new rate on our VA loan. The process was so smooth. Any questions you have Jose has the answer. He is looking out for his clients and always trying to find the best rate possible. To purchase or refinance look no further. You have found your team.</text>< Pictures>

I was pleased with my entire loan process from contact to closing. Gerald White, my loan officer, performed splendidly along with his dynamic fellow staff Kathy, Jason and Brian. The process was seamless and professional throughout. The legendary duo, "Batman and Robin" never worked more closely together than did those four in resolving issues and time lines that I would have found overwhelming. I felt like a newborn that had taken its bottle, went peacefully asleep, and awakened to find the whole process efficiently completed. My gratitude to their entire staff. Great job!!<//Text>

<pictures>None<//pictures><rating>5<//rating><Review>Gary Krakowski and his team knocked it out of the park with their services. As a first time home buyer, I didn't know what to expect; however, all my concerns dissipated quickly after just one phone call. Gary and his team allowed for a stress free, streamlined and smooth process as a first time home buyer. Despite the obstacles COVID-19 presented, Gary and his team were very informative and kept an open line of communication throughout the entire process. Aside from their proactive and friendly communication, Gary and his team were very informative and patient, which was much appreciated as a first time buyer. Throughout the process I genuinely felt Gary and his team were looking out for me and my interests, as I didn't get the corporate, impersonal vibe you'd typically expect with other services. Will definitely recommend to friends and family, and to anyone reading this now... you won't be disappointed!</Review>< UserId.>

Angie went above and beyond for me on this transaction, I explained my needs to her and she surpassed them. She was available for me at all times especially when I had questions (I had plenty), even when she was extremely busy, which is highly appreciated. Angie was very transparent,  incredibly knowledgeable, courteous and patient. I went through a few offers on properties before my final purchase and Angie was there to help through each and every one of them often coordinating with my agent behind the scenes. I couldn't have asked for better support throughout such a stressful process. Thanks to Angie I am now a proud homeowner! I'd highly recommend her (and already have).<//review></record></dataset><record>

I had the pleasure to work with John Punch. He is very professional, friendly and easy to reach out to. We were refinancing the current mortgage and prepared for the long and stressful process from day 1. But John took care of everything and the refinancing process is easy, painless and straightforward like applying for a new credit card! Highly recommended and will definitely work with John again for my future mortgage needs.< /text>

<text>Kyle Wright of American Pacific Mortgage is a consummate professional. He was recommended by my real estate agent to help us with a transaction we thought would be relatively straight forward but ended up being somewhat complicated.  Kyle is a creative problem solver and through every step of the process kept things moving, came up with ideas to help us through obstacles and always kept us in the loop. Kyle and his team were very responsive, explained things to us so we understood what issues we were facing and they always had a solution. Our refinance transaction was processed expeditiously.  Kyle and his team are awesome!

<Text>Rich was the best! He was very involved throughout my entire homebuying process, and went above and beyond in SO many areas. As a first time homebuyer, he carefully walked me though everything every step of the way. From the onset he was very in-tune with my needs and made sure I was comfortable within my monthly budget, not just based on my debt to income ratio. He also provided great personal perspective on buying a condo in Chicago specifically. I felt prepared and informed from my very first showing through closing. Highly recommend!<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Very pleased with the service I received getting my re-fi. I will say it took a good bit longer than I expected and with more paperwork in the past, but I was told that this was mostly a result of COVID and demand for new loans.  My broker was helpful and responsive to me every step of the way.</text>

<text>From the beginning Nadine Fabien put all of her knowledge to assist me with my home buying process, she kept me up to date with Avery areas of my loan. At the end she accelerated the closing so that I could move to my new home in a timely manner. I would over and over recommend Nadine Fabien to anyone who's looking to buy a home to let her be your loan officer. If 10 was the biggest number to give her I would give her 💯.</text>< Name>

The company in diamond bar goes above and beyond. Samuel Castorena keeps you updated in every stage of your loan.  There were times where I had needed the follow-up and reminders and they were so professional throughout. The staff is friendly and courteous. They are also technically advance w their program and e-signature process especially during COVID where you don’t want to leave your home. Please check the company out and talk to Sam.< /Text>

APM was incredibly fast at turning around my documents and requirements, and I was able to refinance in under 30 days.  Before finding APM, I used another major mortgage originator, and it took almost 3 months because they took on too many applications.  By moving my refinance over to APM, I lowered my rate and closed much quicker.<//Review>

Before finding APM, I used another major mortgage originator, and it took almost 3 months because they took on too many applications.  By moving my refinance over to APM, I lowered my rate and closed much quicker.< /review>

I would recommend Angela Qawi 1000x over.  She was so helpful throughout the entire process, even for a first time homeowner like me who had a million questions.   Thank you so much Angela for working to keep me in the monthly payment budget I asked for and even lower.< /text>

<Text>Jenny is Conners assistant and is honestly THE BEST. Always helpful, always answers the phone when you call and is quick to act.

You will NEVER get ahold of Conner and he will NEVER call you back. Ever. I know we are all busy and very important but come on... it was a very frustrating experience.

From the beginning I had expressed multiple times that if possible I’d like to be in home in the 4th of January due to a new job starting. I was given a lot of false hope... I get it this stuff takes a long time. There are many people involved. But don’t say “ya it’s possible” then never tell me what’s going on.. I turned things in within minutes of receiving items and they on the other end took days-weeks to get processed. Deadlines where always drawn out.

So good luck to you buying your new home!</Text></record>

Clearly a numbers guy who doesn't mind (in fact, I think he kinda likes it!) running numbers on the spot for any scenario you throw at him as well as presenting some you may not have considered. He came up with an option that was better than the one I was going to use. Highly recommended.<//review>< pics>

Todd was engaged with me right away.  His experience allowed him to anticipate all my questions and answered many before I even had a chance to ask.  He and his team kept me in the loop throughout the entire process and made it simply and clean.  He always answered my calls,  even on his day off and late evenings.  I highly recommend his service.<//Review>

Donnersson is the best broker that i have ever worked with! He treats you as the most important customer that he has, discuss all alternatives available, and he is always available to answer your question.

I was referred to Richard Honquest by my realtor, and I am very thankful he was the one who guided me through the process. He was always looking after my best interests, and regardless of his busy schedule he had always took his time to make sure I understood each and every step of the process. As this was my first purchase I'm sure I had asked many stupid questions, but he was always accommodating and understood where I was coming from.

I won't be looking at anyone except Rich for my future financial ventures, and will be working hard to hope that it becomes a reality where we can  cross roads again.<//Text>

Although our loan application process met many bumps and turns in the road, all of which were out of APM's control, Tracy and her team were able to close the deal! Tracy followed through well and stayed on top of it.
Thank you!< /Text>

A+ Transaction. Quick communication, and follow up. Easy to get a hold of, never waited more then minutes for a follow phone call. Closed on projected close date when major curve ball was thrown at us. Will use Gary and his team for all future needs.<//Text>

Chuck Jarrard was the loan agent for our first home. He was responsive, fair, and ultimately helped us achieve a closing in under 30 days (which in Phoenix is unheard of.) We can’t say thank you enough to all the hard work Chuck put in on our behalf. Thanks, Chuck!< /review>

<Text>Francesca Sourbis was our loan advisor. She was great from the first phone call until closing day. This was our first home buying process. We had 2 other lenders that we were dealing with before we came to American Pacific Mortgage, and we were not satisfied with customer service, interest rates etc.. We was referred to Francesca by our real estate agent. The moment we contacted her, we was pre approved in no time. She was so communicative through the whole process with emails, texts, and phone calls. She helped us get a decent rate. Also, It really helped to be able to text her after business hours to ask questions.  I highly recommend her.<//Text>< Pics>

I was very happy with my experience refinancing. Since the best interest rate could not be given to me because my credit score was 1 point too low, I have to give it a 4 not 5 star rating.</review>

I only have 3 words for Jorge Ramirez - ABOVE AND BEYOND! Jorge was helpful, explanative, available and not only answered our questions, but encouraged them! He went about and beyond every step of the way to make sure we understood a very new and complex process and that we were not only comfortable but thrilled with everything. Jorge really made our experience as first home buyers smooth and easy, and we could not more highly recommend someone to not only a first home buyer, but to any home buyer!< /text>

When loans are closing in 90+ days these days, i was able to close within a month for a refinance. Communication is great with Rodrigo, and his assistants/Closers, and almost efficient. All questions answered and explained thoroughly.< /review>

He was extremely responsive and worked hard to meet our needs. Donnersson’s effort and work he put towards helping us was amazing! He continued to keep me update throughout the whole process. Every step after that was truly an easy process with Donnersson’s team and getting everything set for the closing. We had a great experience!</review>

No need to look anywhere else, John saved my closing from an absolute nightmare I ran into with a big bank. 10 days before closing with the big bank, I was informed my loan has been denied. My realtor referred me to John and he was able to not only get me a rate at .5% lower, he was also able to get it done in almost 10 days, which is almost unheard of. As a small business owner, the process is more difficult and a lot time consuming. I'm not sure he sleeps and he wasn't going to quit until everything was finalized. He answered the phone every time I called, even Sunday morning. He is highly recommended for all your lending needs<//text>

Sean and his partners at American Pacific Mortgage helped us with the refinance of our home. It has been quite an up and down process with the pandemic but he managed to get it done at a great rate and for less years. We can’t thank him enough for the hard work he has put forth and I highly recommend him and American Pacific Mortgage.< /Text>

Mitchell Chernock is very friendly and personable, but there were times where he did not outright answer my questions, because he often would get sidetracked by telling a story about himself or someone he knows. I submitted the documents he and his team requested of me as quickly as I could, but there were times when his team lacked good communication within their own unit. On multiple occasions, I had Mitchell and/or different team members contact me for documents that I had already uploaded into their online portal days ago and those documents hadn't been reviewed in that time; they were just sitting there. Without my and my husband's consent, Mitchell tried to charge us a fee in order to lower our interest rate. He acted like he was the one who was able to give us such a great interest rate, but in reality, we were the ones who gave ourselves the lower interest rate, because he was charging us to buy points, which is something that we had not discussed or agreed to. On our loan disclosure, he had additional fees and no lender credit towards us. When we questioned him on this, he said, "Well, I have a company to run and employees to pay." He did not seem to care that as his clients (who have stable jobs and incredible credit scores) we have a family to care for. We decided to consult with another lender Ben Swett (who is amazing and we HIGHLY recommend), and he pointed out all of the questionable items on our loan disclosure. Ben helped us negotiate with Mitchell, so that we can get a better deal. Something I feel we shouldn't have had to do in the first place as his clients. Also, from the beginning, I disclosed to Mitchell during a phone call and on our loan application that we would be gifted some money from my parents. He said that was fine and didn't give me any further instructions. We deposited the check from my parents, and it wasn't until we were close to wrapping everything up, Mitchell told us that we need a copy of the check, which we didn't have. We spoke with our bank, and they told us that our lender could retrieve a copy of the check faster than we could, so we emailed the bank's instructions on how to attain a copy of the check to Mitchell and his team. Mitchell called my husband and alluded to the fact that he can't get a copy of the check, because it was illegal for him to do it, even though our bank said he could get it. Two of Mitchell's team members contacted me and asked me to get a copy of the check, and that's when I finally told them of my dissatisfaction with their service and how they're constantly making us jump through hoops instead of helping us throughout this process. Not once has Mitchell apologized to me or my husband for his lack of professionalism and reluctance to help us. He continued to act cheerful and go on as if nothing was wrong, and he would repeatedly say how he's worked so hard to get us a great deal, but at that point, it all felt very fake and narcissistic of him. Another thing, through the majority of this process, he only contacted me and would leave my husband out on emails and texts. I addressed the issue by telling him that he needs to include my husband in all communication, because we're buying the house together and my husband needs to be in the know of what's happening. Mitchell continued to only contact me even if it was my husband who was reaching out to him via text or phone call. I'm definitely not satisfied with Mitchell's actions and service.<//Text>

Thanks Said for the support and efforts to get financing process completed. My case was unique and complicated due to my work outside US. You fought for me to overcome obstacles.

I hope we can do more business in the future.

If I could give zero, I would.

Bottom line, if you want a lender who will be honest, straightforward, gives you true facts and doesn't put assumptions in your head, this isn't the company you want. Period.< /Review>

This is my third time using Alessandro. He is trustworthy, knowledgeable, responsive, and professional when it comes to the (re)financing portion of home ownership. He makes what seems like a stressful process really smooth and simple.<//text>

<Review>Allessandro was awesome to work with. This is my 3rd time working with Allessandro and he always makes the process of applying for a mortgage super easy. His associate Jill was also very helpful in making sure things went smoothly. We closed on our refi in about 25 days. Would easily recommend them for anyone looking for a easy and quick mortgage process.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>Jeff Larocco is so awesome he helped us to buy our home and walked us through every step.  We came from California and did not know anything about the loan processes in Illinois.  Then when the interest rates went down he helped us to refinance to get a much lower rate.   Thanks Jeff< /Review></record>

My sister is a real estate agent and about 25 years ago she gave me Ed's number.  I have used him for my 1st house, my son's house, my house that my son and I flipped and now again for a refi.  I gladly recommend him and as a matter of fact, I just need about 3 weeks ago.  Good Job, ED.< /review>

<text>I've been waiting for this opportunity to share my experience with the godsend that goes by the name Halee Epling Daily. This incredible woman gave me peace when I most needed it, and the skills and knowledge to successfully complete what can only be described is a very complicated transaction. Halee had to manage not only my real estate transaction, which was a contingent sale, but the pressing needs of the other two buyers downstream of my house sale which were also contingent sales. Not only did Halee provide me with regular updates; she was always willing to answer my many questions, and maintain contact with the other party to the transaction.  I cannot say enough good things about Halee. I will forever be grateful to her and will recommend her to anyone needing loan services.</text>< pictures>

I've been waiting for this opportunity to share my experience with the godsend that goes by the name Halee Epling Daily. This incredible woman gave me peace when I most needed it, and the skills and knowledge to successfully complete what can only be described is a very complicated transaction. Halee had to manage not only my real estate transaction, which was a contingent sale, but the pressing needs of the other two buyers downstream of my house sale which were also contingent sales. Not only did Halee provide me with regular updates; she was always willing to answer my many questions, and maintain contact with the other party to the transaction.  I cannot say enough good things about Halee. I will forever be grateful to her and will recommend her to anyone needing loan services.<//Review>

<text>It was a pleasure working with Steve! Funny story, I actually chose him randomly from the AP Mortgage website, looked at everyone's pictures and thought, "oh, he looks like a nice guy." AP Mortgage was the preferred lender for the property I purchased and unlike other lender websites, I didn't see a way to just apply for a loan on their website. There was just a form to fill in your information to have someone contact you to give you a quote. Well, I waited a day and no one had contacted me other than an email saying someone will reach out, so me being impatient, clicked around the website and found out I can send in an application after selecting a loan officer and visiting their page!

Anyway, Steve was great! He has experience working in this field for quite some time, so he was watching the market to get me a good rate. If anything important comes up that needs to be done right away, he always calls. Everything was a breeze, no huge hiccups. He takes the time to explain things in ways I can understand, since this is my 1st home, I didn't know much of the process at all.

I went into the process with certain expectations and knowing I would need to provide alot of documentation, so I think I already had most of what was normally required. Due to my personal circumstances, Steve suggested I provide more work history to show consistency and a letter with explanation of gaps. I thought it was a great idea to be extra thorough to submit all of it in one big package! I have read other's experiences where they feel annoyed that they have to keep submitting more because the underwriter keeps requesting additional information and I did not feel any frustrations regarding that at all.

I would definitely work with Steve again if given the chance and refer him to my friends and family :)<//text>< Pictures>

I was referred by a real estate agent to two Mortgage companies but I also wanted to interview a third one as well. I read the reviews on line about American Pacific Mortgage and being very impressed I selected them as my third option.  Right from the start JJ Mack at American Pacific Mortgage was a go-getter, very responsive, and communicative; he seemed to be two steps ahead of the other mortgage companies and got things done in a timely manner. I selected American Pacific Mortgage as my mortgage company.  JJ Mack took the time to help me through every step in the process and explained everything fully easing my mortgage anxieties.  He personally called me on multiple occasions updating me on the process and letting me know what to expect and when to expect it so we could meet our target dates.  JJ Mack is reliable and trustworthy and I know he had my best interest at heart and because of that I can't tell you the stress he took from me!  He is a professional in every sense of the word!</Text>

<Review>I wont come back. The two Mortgage brokers where  bob Enright and Camilla Papaioannou. If you want to deal with people that take you for granted  and not get back with you ever choose them. You will be the one calling them or texting them and maybe they will get back with you while your in the process of a refinancing. I guess they dont need customer's..<//Review>< Pictures>

This is the worst Mortgage company to every deal with. Not only did I have a horrible experience (4 months) with the process of getting a home come to find out Melanie Overmoe and her team calculated numbers wrong and I seem to have to pay more money out of my pocket (escrow) even after signing my loan and moving in my home. Then come to find out they sold my loan to the the worst loan company 15 days after I signed my paper work and I had not even moved in yet with no notice. DO NOT DO BUISNESS WITH THIS COMPANY!< /Text>
