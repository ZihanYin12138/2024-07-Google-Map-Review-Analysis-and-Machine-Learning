This place trashed my $114,000 luxury suv
STAY AWAY from PARKWAY

if you need great service go to AutoNation Chevrolet.
Autonation, knows how to treat any type of vehicle no matter the price tag!
Your vehicle steering wheel will be covered, your seats will be covered, your floor mats will be covered!

do you care about your car? ...then go to AutoNation for service'

AMENDED AFTER THEY RESPONDED:  TELLING YOU IM GOING TO LEAVE A BAD REVIEW FOR YOUR NEGLECT AND DAMAGE TO MY VEHICLE IS NOT A THREAT IT WAS A PROMISE.

WE RECORD EVERYTHING, ACCUSING ANYONE OF A CRIME (MAKING THINGS UP) IS PUNISHABLE BY LAW AND MONETARY DAMAGES
I SUGGEST YOU ERASE YOUR RESPONSE, DEFENDING YOURSELF AFTER I POSTED ALL THE PHOTOS IS A JOKE AT THIS POINT

UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DISCUSS MY LIFE ONLY DEFEND MY REVIEW I GAVE YOU

THE PHOTOS SHOW THE WORLD WHAT KIND OF CARE YOU GIVE

YOU ARE ACTING A LITTLE CHILD ,  YOU DID NOT EVEN TRY TO DEFEND YOUR OWN BUSINESS AND WHY MY CAR HAD $750 worth of grease damage from your mechanics !!

I GUESS BECAUSE OF THE PHOTOS arent defendanle!!!

INSTEAD YOU CHOSE TO USE LIES AND DEFAMATORY REMARKS TO DEFEND YOUR TREATMENT OF MY VEHICLE.

SO I GUESS YOU ARE FORTUNE TELLERS AND FORSAW ME LEAVING A BAD REVIEW SO YOU DESTROYED MY VEHICLE.... :) IS THAT IT???

MY FAMILY WOULD NOT EVER GO TO YOUR DEALERSHIP AGAIN,

FUNNY THING IS.... IN 2 YEARS YOU DAMAGED THIS VEHICLE 2X TIMES.... MUST HAVE AN ONGOING PROBLEM AND YOU CANT SOLVE IT SO YOU RETALIATE AGAINST YOUR CUSTOMERS

All your good reviews are for sales and I will admit the men in the suits are very good at schmoozing !

But your mechanics..... I guess they don’t know they’re working for Cadillac!!! and they think they’re working for a rental car service Because they sat there and drove my vehicle joy riding it according to the mileage OVER 70 MILES WERE DRIVEN FOR AN AC TEST. And you have the audacity to lie on paper on top of it AND TELL ME IT WAS ONLY 2 MILES

i even uploaded the OWNERS ORIGINAL RESPONSE just in case he changes it... he doesn't try to defend THE ILL TREATMENT OF MY VEHICLE WHILE UNDER HIS CARE, he just trys to rebutle and defame me since he knows i will never shop there again. GROW UP MEN THAT OWN BUSINESS RESPOND MUCH MORE TACTFULLY!<//text>

It was in absolute good faith that our Service Director decided to let bygones be bygones and allow you to bring the vehicle in instead of your father as per our agreement over the past couple years. We had truly hoped that things would be different this time. We will be contacting your father direct to sort the keying damage to our loaner Cadillac as we are unable to tolerate threatening behavior toward our employees or others affiliated with Parkway in any way. As a fellow prior Chevy dealer, we welcome your father back and will continue to take excellent care of his needs in the future.'}</resp>

<review>It’s not often I leave a review but I was absolutely amazed and grateful to have such an awesome experience while making such a big decision like purchasing a vehicle. I went in for a specific truck with specific requests and every need was met. I had the pleasure of being helped by Chaz and Eddy who went above and beyond for me. To top it off, as I was transitioning some things from my old vehicle the owner and the guys came out to crack some jokes with me before I got to drive away in my new truck. Thank you to each of you and keep up the great work!
Blessings,

I've been to Parkway twice now for service.  The people here are really nice, respectful, and good at what they do.  Lydia McDonald is amazing.  I won't consider getting my car serviced anywhere else.  I actually look forward to my next service to see Lydia!

3/11/21 Just went in for first oil change and tire rotation.  Great dealership!< /review>

The service department at Parkway Cadillac is the best we have ever received. We always receive excellent customer service from Lydia McDonald. She goes over and beyond for her clients and is always so pleasant. Whenever we drop off our car we feel confident that our car will be taken care of.<//review>

<review>Was not happy with this place, had an appointment but still had a two hour wait. They tried to charge me full price $136 for a oil change even though they were advertising an oil change special for $99.95, make sure to check what you're being charged is the correct price!!!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

I’m absolutely thrilled with this dealership! Everyone was very friendly and welcoming especially, Anthony!

He has the awesome ability to make you feel extremely comfortable while answering any questions that you may have, and I had quite a bit of them 😬

His costumer service skills were genuine and humble.
I look forward to visiting again soon 😊

Parkway Cadillac service is what the Cadillac ownership experience should be. Always friendly, sensitive to time schedules, thorough -- total quality throughout - especially Lydia and Linda! Also, the prices for items not covered by the factory warranty are very fair, and comparable with local auto repair shops - and the new set of tires we purchased for our SRX were actually less than several local 'discount' tire centers. Thanks for always taking great care of our vehicle - and us!<//review>

It is a well known fact that going to a dealership for service is not high on the list of many people that I know. I, however, don't mind taking my car in for service. Why you ask? Two words, Parkway Cadillac. The family at Parkway Cadillac truly cares about their customers. They are friendly, caring and extremely competent at their jobs; from the service advisors, mechanics, and sales staff, to the owner. I do not know many dealership owners that walk through the waiting room checking on their customers and having a cup of coffee. I experienced this more than once. When my car is in for service I receive check in calls from my service advisor, Lydia McDonald, to let me know how my vehicle is doing. Lydia truly cares about geting my car in and out. She takes great care of me and my car and I appreciate her. The service department does their best to give you a timeframe when service will be completed and they stick to it. Communication is GREAT!! Workmanship is Great! So, if you want to have a fantastic "all around" experience, please visit Parkway Cadillac in Valencia. We look forward to purchasing our third car from Parkway at the end of the year.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I took my 2017 Cadillac XTS in for  AC repair after it was supposedly repaired at Casa de Cadillac earlier for an AC repair.  Brandon in the service department was helpful and confident they (Parkway) could fix it.  They had the car for 3 days, called and said apparently Casa De Cadillac had not put enough coolant in the AC and that was the problem...they had filled it up, tested for leaks, and it was fixed...we picked up the car, reluctantly,  drove it 3 times locally...now it has no AC again.  So disappointed, it is now at a different Cadillac dealership.< /text>

Horrible service, not recommended at all.
My 2017 Escalade had a problem with only 16k miles on it. A problem arose with the transmission not shifting correctly, the engine would be revving at over 3000 RPM shifting into 1st gear, they took my vehicle in and could not find the problem, they instead performed what they called " a re-learn programming " after many calls a scheduled it to be checked out twice, No luck, they could not find the problem with it. I had to pull off the side of the freeway a number of times because the vehicle would not run correctly, called AAA a bunch of different times to have the car towed however, by the time they arrived, the car would once again be working so just drove off to my destinations.

I expressed this to the service manager which by the way he would not return my phone calls until way later after I contacted Cadillac.
I also let messages for my service adviser and she didn't return my call either,I almost felt as dropping off the vehicle in their front door and telling them  to keep it. By the way, I also left a message for the general manager and he again never returned my call.

Finally I received a call from the service manager and he sated that there wasn't anything they could do since they could not find the problem.
To my surprise, he refereed me to another Cadillac dealer, " Really, you're going to send me to your competition because you guys can't figure out the problem with my vehicle?' Wow, Wow for lack of other words...
Having no choice, I took my vehicle to another dealer and in 2 hours they found the problem.  They fixed it and the same day I have my car back.

By the way, this would be my third Escalade purchased in the last four years.

MR. OWNER this question is for you .............

Why do you bother sending out emails asking for " how was your experience on your last visit at Parkway Cadillac"

You should focus on coaching your employees to treat your customers as your life line because with out them your business would not exist.  I can say one positive thing about your place, the only Positive person was Scott  "James Dean" your salesman other than that, I can assure you I would never go back to your place and I am so sick of the lack of service , lack of professionalism and..... lack of respect I received from your dealership that I will make sure none of my acquaintances and or family members ever buy anything from you guys again.

I am sure you will come up with some apology and explanation to this case and or situation but it really doesn't matter anymore as consumers are wise and educated  and a well informed consumer is double well educated.<//review>

<Text>My Cadillac went in for service the week of April 22nd.  I was told that the car needed a module and it had to be ordered.  My service writer, L, gave me a date but the module did not arrive.  I was given another date and the module did not arrive.  It is now early June, my car is still at Parkway Cadillac, service writer L does has not responded to recent emails and I don't know if I will ever get my car back.</Text>< Pics>

<resp>{'time': 1559926976329, 'text': 'After looking into this further, we have discovered that your vehicle has been outsourced to us from the local Mercedes dealership and has a part on back order. Since the vehicle is over 15 years old, certain parts are a little harder to come by and our hands are tied until it arrives as we do not make or stock older model parts. The delay in completing repairs has nothing to do with the dealership or its staff. The failed components are obsolete and no longer manufactured and this should have been communicated to you by your selling dealer. Several vendors have promised delivery of the parts but have failed to come through on that promise. Caught in the middle between you and your selling dealer, Parkway is working vigorously to locate the parts needed to complete the repair and will continue to do so until this unfortunate situation is resolved.'}< /resp>< gmap_id>

The park could use a little landscaping attention, but the whole (stop the homeless) from using this park as a place to retreat factor has improved it seems, each day when I drive by.</review>

Unfortunately, this park was quite dated with very little to offer.  There was a homeless man napping on the bench... for me is not usually a problem but it was the closest bench to the play ground. This discouraged me from venturing farther from my daughter in order to sit while she played. There was on the other hand plenty of space to run.</Text><username>emma cane< /username><UserId.>115903063453702589945< /UserId.>< Gmap_id>

Definitely do not let your kids near the bathroom area or in the bathrooms, I can not imagine there is any measure of safety in them. Regardless of what anyone is saying, there is a thriving level people who reside here and simply come right back every time the city removes them or their garbage. Again, the bathrooms cannot be safe. Not sure why the city does t simply demolish and remove the bathrooms and the old pool area.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Restrooms are always closed so better bring a bottle or a bucket. Basketball courts are a bit rough but manageable.  The kids love it though. There's a big rock they love climbing on.</Text>

Lots of street parking, tidy play area, shaded grassy areas. The usual Modesto homeless visitors. When the bathrooms are unlocked you may find someone's possessions strewn around.

I would take children to the play area but NOT the bathrooms.< /Text>

<Rating>3<//Rating><Review>Beautiful park, nice grass, has aplay structure we didn't use, but a dad and his kids were enjoying it. We played hackey on the bball court. Bathrooms were locked, no drinking fountains. Presumably so that people who don't own or rent a home can't relieve themselves in the privacy of a restroom with a toilet or wash their hands in a sink when finished. Probably no fountains so that same said people don't have access to water as this might make drug use, hygiene or laundry too easy. But at least everyone else who walks their dogs have plenty of grass for them to deficate upon. Why not have bathrooms for kids/parents and separate ones for adults.< /Review><user_id>100650490021039400142<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>This is a good park to take kids for a nice time. Besides swings and a small play are, there is an unique play area that the kids really enjoyed climbing on and sliding down. There is also a basketball court and a large grassy area that the kids can run around and kick a ball. It's well maintained and sits in a residential area with lots of parking around it. We will visit again. The only thing I did not like, no doors on the bathroom stalls.<//Review>< Pictures>

Great park, except you can't let you young children run around. Homeless drug addicts lurking in the shadows.  If you go here stay vigilant.</review>

(Translated by Google) Nice park but unfortunately you have to be alert in the bathroom area there are always strange people.

Bonito parque pero lamentablemente hay que estar alerta en la zona de los baños siempre  hay personas raras.</Review>

<review>I went in to sell some of my gold jewelry.
I couldn’t be more happy at the service. I
Felt very comfortable with everything from the
Price I asked for and received very fair market value,
To the no hassle treatment I received. I feel really
Compelled to give them the highest recommendation
Possible. Great experience.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>Pierre was very professional and extremely friendly when I came in to have a few things checked out. He went the extra mile to make sure everything was working perfectly and looked amazing while keeping good conversation.

Definitely the best experience I’ve had in a jewelry store and I will definitely be back for any watch or jewelry needs I have moving forward!< /review>< Pics>

The owner was such a big help. I was in dire need of a gold chain for my sons 18th birthday. The deal on a chain I was supposed to buy at another store fell through.  I called up diamond and jewelry exchange and they told me to come on in they had lots of nice gold chains. The owner knew my price range and gave me a great deal. Beautiful chain. My son loves it!!!!
Will be back!!
Lots of great unique jewelry!<//review>

I randomly walked in just to browse through the store and was met with the warmest store owner and he’s now my go-to jeweler. He broght new life back to a couple of Cartier pieces of mine that another jewelry store damaged and I purchased another piece of jewelry as well. I’ll be back again and again!

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I am happy that I finally get a chance to review the Diamond and Jewelry Exchange in Costa Mesa (Newport-Mesa), right next to the iconic HawleyWoods Barber shop.

Pierre is a great man and great jeweler as well.

He is able to find WHAT EVER you want as well!!!

I went in there a few years ago to see if perhaps he had some Rolex or Cartier watches for sale for both men and women and sure enough he did!!!

It didn’t stop there.

Pierre seems to have deep contacts in the business and has access to amazing deals found in the best places such as ESTATE SALES and more !!!

I’m a guy and only wear fine watches and really don’t wear or use other jewelry but for my wife I have found diamond rings and ruby rings and bracelets and the list goes on.... SERIOUSLY!!!

Pierre has things not jewelry related as well if you are looking to buy anyone a gift such as coins and other things.

Lastly for things such as repairs or cleanings, also consider Pierre as well but just know that you may be leaving with MORE than you expected because he has a plethora of things to look at at almost every price.

I truly hope this helps both YOU the reviewer and Pierre because us consumers NEED more shops like this instead of the bigger more expensive places out there.

THANK YOU PIERRE !!!

<review>I recommend seeing Pierre for any jewelry needs before you check anywhere else.  He is very knowledgeable and gives fair and reasonable pricing.  I utilized Brilliant Earth via online for an engagement ring and could have saved money talking to Pierre first.  On top of which, Brilliant Earth requested 2 to 3 weeks to do a resize, where Pierre did a great job in less than 3hrs.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Pierre is wonderful, I came in to sell some jewelry and he took good care of me. Also a great place to shop for engagement rings and diamond jewlery. He has lots of interesting pieces along with Rolex watches.
If your in the market for a watch or diamonds I recommend stopping in to see him first!

Pierre is an expert in watches, diamonds, and other jewelry. He has decades of experience and is generous with his time. He was able to help me value many assorted items that had been passed down from my grandmother, many of which were over a hundred years old. He is trustworthy and helpful. His prices are also very reasonable. I highly recommend him.</Text>

I've been coming here for years for any jewelry purhcases I've had to make.  Simply one of the best and friendliest shops I've ever been into and the owner Pierre is always spectacular to both talk with and purchase from with his knowledge on the goods that he sells.  I like this shop so much that it is the only shop I would and have ever recommended to friends and family!</Text>

< Review>
I thoroughly enjoyed my jewelry shopping experience here.  It’s a small independent jewelry shop with an eclectic style.   Pierrè (owner) has a great collection of rings, watches, and all kinds of jewelry, new, used, vintage, expensive, very expensive, but also something simple and affordable...I found exactly what I needed.   Be prepared to spend a lot of time looking, and listening to Peierrè’s funny and entertaining stories.  It’s worth a trip.< /Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I've been coming here for a few years now. The owner, Pierre is very knowledgeable and honest. He always gives the best value. I've sold some watches to him and have bought my wife's wedding ring through him. He has a wide selection of jewelry to buy and will work with you to get what you're looking for in your budget. I highly recommend Diamond and Jewelry Exchange for any of your jewelry needs, buying or selling. You won't regret it!</Review></record>

I am not normally a review person but I could not help the fact that I am compelled to share. I have been hesitant in my past of buying jewelry and especially fine time pieces from brokers (not an New Factory Dealer) like Rolex and Breitling in this case. I have to say Pierre was a true professional, both in his approach and knowledge. He gave the accurate information to really help me make an informed and educated buying decision!  As a result I bought a Breitling and Rolex for the first time in my young 54 years!  Highly recommend him and the company.
Thanks Pierre it’s was fun and painless!< /Text>

Pierre is an excellent jeweler, very honest and helpful in finding the right piece that fits your budget.  The diamonds that I purchased from him were the exact quality that he said they would be and actually praised for a bit more than what I had paid him for.</review>

<Review>This is the best place to sell & buy high-end items. They are fair with pricing and offer great compensation with their exchange program. There are many competitors in the area...dont be fooled. No one can beat this company's: customer service, knowledge, experience in the industry, and positive energy. Save time and frustration....make this your first (and only) stop for selling your jewelry. Im a customer for life!<//Review>< user>

Just bought some diamond stud earrings for my wife’s bday. Pierre gave me an incredible deal for some high quality diamonds. I almost went to Macys to get jewelry from them but did a little research and confirmed the obvious-department stores buy in bulk and do not focus on quality, only their bottom line. Fortunately i found Pierre’s shop and walked away with a higher quality product at a better price (seriously saved about $150)!< /text>

< review>
If you do not have a specific nail tech in mind, do not go to this nail salon. The nail tech I had did a very messy job on my nails and she was really rough. She didn’t even file the edges and left huge bits underneath my nail and around the edges. I came home and had to file it myself. Besides that, she talked me out getting a gel manicure based on the photo I showed her. When she was finished, it looked nothing like the photo. Not even close to it. She also threw on a few jewels and called it a day. I was so upset, I went to Sally’s Beauty and Target for nail art and stickers. When I got home, I created my own version of the photo. That’s all I asked the nail tech to do. I even explained that I understand it’s not going to be the same, but similar please. She had no creativity. No vision as a nail tech. Because of the lack of communication on her part, I didn’t know what the heck she was doing. I explained to her that I wanted a gel fill since I already had gel extensions with a design for a month now. She talked me out of getting that and told me the photo was dip not gel so I believed her. At the end of the day, it didn’t even resemble what I wanted. Needless to say, I would not recommend this place or go back to it. I will be doing my own nails from now on. Stay away if you have an appointment with any random nail tech.<//review>

<review>I have been going to Happy Nails for about 5 or more years. Kim is really great. They have good and nice staff. All their chairs for pedis are massage chairs so its nice to have a massage while getting a pedi. All their instruments are also sterilized each time and if they mess up something they will fix it for you the one you want it and they are nice about it too< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfOIRRTeUTq8nKmIZJzOk1x5RwS5-azQYd5z7N=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZgf0FOygTizxYn-1BOWkeOQ8FgSrI96GZ8mSl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Me and my. Mom got a bad pedicure. They rushed us. Paid 30 dollars for a basic pedicure. They didn't do anything. It was a worse pedicure we ever got here at Happy Nails. We are not coming back.</Text>

Love coming here. Have never been disappointed. Hillary always amazes me and provides such great customer service. I know they won't be exactly how said picture I show her looks, but she gets them done and they always look sooo pretty. Even when I'm being a pain in the a** and picky. Call ahead tho. Can get packed/busy fast. Don't rush either. Take your time so they turn out right.< /Review>

<Rate>2<//Rate><Review>My daughter and I got out nails done. She got the acylic and I got the regular manicure. The lady that was with me said I had “ a lot of cuticles” and wiped it on the top of my hand without taking it off until the very end.  For a basic manicure, she could have at least trimmed my nails straight.  At least my nail matched the guy’s hair cut in the picture 😂

Side note: I read one of the reviews and I have the same tip for them. If you have a customer in front of you, it is rude to speak in another language in front of them... especially laughing  after watching your customer look down at their nails wondering why they’re cut crooked.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80dc9d802ec59a21:0x9e7b5f2ba730b4f1<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
My. 1st and last time.
I walked in and was welcomed imediatelly.Did. not wait much and was direct to seat at the pedicure seat.So my 1st impression was good.
However my pedi+mani was not well done.she missed the corner of my nails and my pedicure was the worst the thecnician did not clean the remaining of polish around my toes I had to ask her to do it.
And there was remaining thr blue/green scrub that she use on my feet.(NOT GOOD)
she only painted half pf my little toe nail the other half I had to point to her.
Ps:If you have a customer in front of you and you do not have anything nice to say just as a tip try not to have side conversations with your coworker in your language.(ITS SUPER RUDE)No matter the subject.
So just bcz you rush and do a super fast job you lack in quality and loose a Customer
I do not recomend a $35 job not worth $15.<//Review>

<Review>They know me by Aly. Today was my first time there and I was blown away! The guy was super nice with me on the phone and in person he is funny! Tiffany was extremely great! Super detail-oriented and such a sweet woman. They definitely gained another customer! Will be going back soon!</Review>< pictures>

<review>Won’t go back. They cut my toe and made me bleed. Lazy work. They didn’t paint my whole nail. Very dissatisfied with the work. $35 for sloppy painting. Should have stayed home and painted my own nails.< /review>< pictures>

< Review>
I am a previous patron. I wanted a full-set of nails. I  told them I am now a diabetic, which I didn't have to disclose. Their demeanor changed immediately and my husband and I were told "no". No reason was given. I was embarrassed in front of other patrons. This business is discriminatory. I am also disabled and was made to feel unworthy.<//Review>

<rating>2</rating><Review>I'm never really totally satisfied when I come here. This particular night I had a 6pm appointment and waited 45 minutes before I was seen. Once I was over charged for a pedicure,  I didn't say anything,  but I should have. It's just okay. They don't really make you feel welcomed, like I've seen at other places. They are overpriced too.<//Review>< GmapID>

<Text>So here’s the scope, id been going here for a while like 6/7 months. Went to Holly, but it just so happen the last two times I went she wasn’t available, so I had to get other ladies. Well, I go back not even a week later cause all my nails chipped, I mean the gel polish, and when I ask if they can fix the nail on the bottom cause it’s lifting they said no, not all nail techs do it cause I’m hollys client, but holly seemed to busy to fix or even to want to deal with me, sooooo, why go here? When you can’t get treated decent especially when you pay $100 each time going every two weeks. All I asked was for them to be fixed cause they were lifting, it’s not like I was asking for it for free, I have money I’ll pay, but come on to tell me they only fill the top of the nail and they don’t care about the bottom of your nail when it lifts, what kind of nail tech is that!!? Regardless if I always go to holly or not EVERY nail tech should check, that just tells me 1. they don’t care about their clients 2. They’re lazy. 3. They’re greedy, the managers response was I needed a new set, which I’m not going to deny, they’re lifting, that was my plan for next time I went in for a fill, since I had just got one not even a week ago, why pay for a full set when I just paid $100 a week ago!  I’ve had acrylics for 20 years, and all this time I’ve never had this kind of experience. I’ve been to many states even countries traveling with the military and I have not been treated like this. Horrible place; save yourself the money go elsewhere. Pedi’s ain’t that great either. I only got them there so I wouldn’t waist time going to separate places and to match hands & feet, but for me it was hit or miss, I only liked 1 lady out of them all, I don’t remember her name but she’s older with glasses. She’s worth it. All the others nope!</Text><Response>None</Response></record></dataset><record>

Wonderful job, I just wish the nail design lady they had was more patient with it. I didn’t get a complicated design, just paws and a cat face. There was a slight bleed in between acetone wipes (I got gel). Honestly could’ve done straighter lines myself, not something I would want to pay $45 for.<//text>

I’ve been here many of times and it’s always way to busy with a long wait, most times I’m told they can’t do my nails and come back another day. They need more staff instead of turning away clients. I stopped going because I’m never fully happy with the service but I got a gift card so I tried to call before to make an appt but no one answered, I showed up to try and get a pedicure to be told to they are to busy and can’t take  me and to come back another day. I went somewhere else but because I still had a gift card I tried another day to get a full set called in and they told me to come in in 30 mins because there is a half hour wait. I agreed gave my name and when I showed up I wasn’t greeted from anyone for 20 mins. Told them I called to come in and I was told to have a seat till they were ready. Almost another 30 mins go by until they call me and start my nails. What’s the point to call to make appt if you still wait another 40 mins .... won’t be going back< /Text>

I have been  A customer of happy nails for about 4 years, I’ve only had a couple of times where I needed to have a small issue resolved - and they were very professional about doing so.  When my mother comes and visit several times a year I take her to happy nails for a  pedicure and manicure because I know that they will take care of her. I do suggest however to make an appointment otherwise there may be a long wait< /text>

Went in yesterday no one was there so I get helped out fast. I was hoping for a better job due to the fact that it wasn’t busy. But no my nails looked like the got painted by my niece. Paid $22 for a pedi. The lady was upset I didn’t giver a tip 😂 don’t come here ladies save your money ! Reason for a 3 1/2 star place. I stick to my lady in Moreno Valley that give me an amazing pedi for $15 with a $5 tip because they never disappoint!!<//review>

Service felt very rushed. The nail tech doing my nails wouldn't stop chatting with another nail tech. I had to remind the nail tech of my hand massage and the sides of my nails were left without nail polish.</review>

Cut my ankle while scrubbing my my feet. Cut my finger. Asked her to give me matte nails showed her a picture and she made them glossy then when I told her that was wrong she told me I was wrong. I got a hang nail in my nails and toes nails. Seriously worst experience ever!! And I paid over $70 for this horrible experience. Finally my nail broke in half a week later while I was not even doing anything strenuous. Don’t go here.<//Text>

Crowded.. So many pedicure chairs all over the place.. Expensive.  They set me at a nail station & waited 25 mins for a nail tech to come..  It wouldve been nice if some1 could tell me something... The manager gave my nail tech the wrong polish color..  Miscommunication.. Smh and plus the person l got gave me big bulky nail & l didnt like the busy aggressive long wait overpriced environment.<//Text>

Helen was my nail technician today and she was amazing! I have been to several nail salons around Menifee, Murrieta and Temecula and I always come back to this place. It's the cleanest and has some of the best prices for the quality.</review>

When I started coming here the service was really good. Now the service has really went down hill. Not sure if they are utilizing cheap products but I shouldn't have flat paint on my toes after putting lotion on my feet. The gloss is completely gone. Then I pay to get a better service and have my callus removed and it's not completely removed. Mediocre service and I do not recommend this place to anyone anymore. Very disappointing for the amount that they charge and the fact that they charge for every single thing. I spend too much when it comes to paying for subpar quality and customer service. Ridiculous!<//Text>

This is probably the filthiest salon I have ever been too. The woman that did my nails didnt take out clean drills or files and she cur me several times. Poor quality of work that is so bad I will likely go somewhere tomorrow to paint over the acrylic (I have pink and white). They rush to get as many people in as possible.<//Review>

Last time I visited I told the lady I did not want the callas remover and she agreed. She did not do it but when I went to pay she told the man in front that she had given it to me. I told him it wasn’t true but she kept repeating that she did it. Instead of believing the customer he listened to the lying employee and charged me almost $10 more for something I never had done. This is a dishonest, unprofessional place. Don’t waste your time or money.< /review>

<Text>Completely unsatisfied,  I'm always waiting doesn't seem to matter whether I have an appt. or not.  I'm always stuck going there, I'm at a loss were there are any good places anymore.  It's sad to be stuck like this.  Personally, my daughter and I went on Saturday 08/20/2016 and we are done.  Both our nails were completely destroyed, as usual in a hurry and truly don't care about their clients..... My nails were way to short and my daughters nails bubbled and the lady (Michelle) said it was my daughters fault.  We left, this time not to return.  I'm in hopes the new Nicky Nails across the street will be better, wish us luck.......<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<text>It was 6:05pm. Closing at 7pm. You had techs available, you couldn't do full set walk in? And be very rude about it, why? I suppose time, perhaps just under an hour not enough time.

We booked an appointment for 3:30 and I didn't even get until 4:15 They did not have a good color selection, and I was very unhappy with the lady (Michelle) who did my nails. At first she was very rough , and when she started to do the acrylics I asked for them shorter ... And she said NO, I was confused if she dos not hear or what , so ask again and she said "oh shorter" okay I can do that. Then when she was doing my nails , I don't know what happened but out of nowhere she said "ow you cut me" , of course I was like what the heck. About 10 mins later I ask for them shorter.. And she said no again. At the end she did ask if I liked them. And she didn't even let me sit in front of the fan for them to dry little I was very upset with her and I do not want to go back. If you are looking for a good salon go to Haute nails( they speak English and play movies so U are not bored)</review><username>Skylar Findlay</username><rating>1</rating><UserId.>109584267170231321163< /UserId.></record>

<review>Place is a little run down and they do not even use the sanitary plastic in the the pedicure tubs. The girl barely removed any cuticle and I had to tell her cut my nails on almost an individual basis. On top of the shoddy run down chairs they are $10 more than any other salon I have ever been to. Huge rip off and not very good services. Totally not worth the price compared to service. This is the type of place people get infections from. Will never go back.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I wasn't happy with the attitude or the service. It was as though I should be honored to be able to go there, like I was lucky to have them do my nails  (this is what was actually said to me). I will not be going back and would advise people not to go there.</text>

I go and have Holly do my fills or full sets.  I have a great experience, as long as I get Holly and it's not a weekend.  The rush on weekends results in a more hurried experience and the manicure is ok, but not as precise as when she has time to attend to my special requests.  The pedicures range from just ok to great, it just depends on who you get.< /Text>

<text>Disappointed!! I walked in and asked for their wait time the man told me 10 mins I waited about an hour before being seated. Then I asked for regular nail polish mani/pedi was there for 3 HOURS!!! walked out with the bottom of my feet still hard as a rock because the woman scrubbed them for about 10 seconds each foot. I feel they gave more priority to their regulars and when someone new to the area comes in they totally shurgged me off. Not happy with the results over priced for what I got I paid $47 for a regular Mani and pedi that I could've just done at home. Never going back I don't recommend it!

This place was horrible. I had an apt at 5 for three people. Three pedicures three waxes 1 manicure. When I got there they took people ahead of us. The lady doing my mom's nails didn't even put a top coat on her nails told her to get out of chair because her apt had showed up. My wax lady kept saying oops and now my eyebrow Arch is super high on one eye normal on other and then again took outside walk inside ahead while we waited for wax. WORST nail shop I have ever been to. Will not return.<//Text>

More like an assembly line of nails, than a spa. Quality is about the same as that of an item off an assembly line as well.< /review>

<Review>It was horrible i just went in for a color change and the lady doing my color change on my own natrual nails  was sooo rude didnt care for what i wanted refused to do the simple plain design i showed her... all i wanted was a simple american style tip with a small flower design on one nail!! ... nooope!! She did it twice because she messed up and the end result was horrible.. soo unprofessional and ontop of that charge me $25 i will never be going back. There are soo many other options where you get what u pay for and more!! Customer service is soo important and this place lacks it big time!!!< /Review>< gmap_id>

<text>This place is horrible. Every time we go there the prices are different. I sent my daughter to get her nails done. She has acrylic. It should be $20 for a fill plus she had one broken nail. They changed her $33. When asked why they said because they had to trim them. I’ve never heard of such a thing. Trim them? That’s part of the process. She’s 15 and had no idea what to do. They scammed a teenager. Ridiculous. Never going there again.< /text>< rate>

This i my 3rd time here and everytime for something else.  They do an amazing job and really take pride in what they do.  If you are looking to get an custom exhaust done this is the place to go.<//review>

Unfortunately, I was referred to Richard Performance Muffler. I do not recommend their business because they do not stand behind their work. They replaced the catalytic converter on our family minivan. The shop manager Nick lied to me about test driving our vehicle and failed to take any ownership or responsibility for their mistake. They failed to remove debris from the part they replaced causing the second catalytic converter to plug-up. This caused even worse engine performance and serious acceleration issues that nearly caused my wife and children to get in an accident when getting on the freeway.

I called Richard Performance Muffler with concerns over their repair and was told that the part they replaced was under warranty with the dealership and that I should take my car to be inspected by a mechanic.

I was very disappointed that my car was back in the shop days later, especially after spending over $1,200 on a repair job that wasn’t done correctly. This cost me even more money, time, and frustration. Not worth the headache!<//Text>

The guys at RPM installed some Magnaflows on my Subaru, and Richard recommended the perfect tips to complete the look... Car sounds great now and the price was very reasonable. I would highly recommend this shop for your mufflers and performance parts!!< /Review>

I'll give my visit 5 stars because they were straight forward, honest, and reasonably priced. I was recommended this location by an engine builder in my network so I wanted to give them a try. The job was to create or mimic a wastegate dumptube with a stainless steel option, matching a broken weld design. On a arrive and inspection the broken weld, they were able to fix the current tube at a great price that took maybe about 20 minutes max. Great work overall. I recommend this location. I am curious what I new dumptube would look like but for now, I am happy with the service. Photo for reference.</Review>

< Review>
Just left the shop and I just had to post a review. My mount on my flag pole had a crack and eventually broke my pole off, I spent weeks trying to find a solid place to go to. After reaching out to a buddy, he suggested me to call Richard up and see what he can do. I called, spoke with Richard and came in a few hours later. He took me immediately and hooked me up with a brand new mount! I didn’t expect him to even take me in since it’s not something they really do but the fact that he still took me in and got it done the same day was seriously 5 star worthy. I’ve gotten my exhaust done at another shop and now I’m mad I just stumbled upon his company when I should’ve been here from the beginning. Amazing service, great work, friendly staff.. what more could you ask for?< /Review>

<Review>Called them today after ordering and receiving my exhaust in the mail. They fit me in towards the end of the day and installed my car back exhaust which only took them an hour. Very friendly people and do amazing work. Family owned business and would 100% recommend them to anyone! 5 stars no question<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

My husband takes his truck here because he knows it's done right even though he has to pay for the quality work. Ordered parts online and had them brought over to be installed. Bonus, their dog and puppy are both so cute and sweet.< /text>

Great group of guys that know what they are doing. They welded an electric exhaust cutout on my Raptor and did a fantastic job. A little pricier than others but it's worth it for the level of work they do.<//review>

Took my van in after receiving an outrageous  estimate ($2000) from the dealership. These guys were quick and honest! The whole experience was easy and so very affordable ($50). Call these guys, you will be respected!< /Text>

Ive done 4 cars here at RPM.
Every time not only am i impressed with there work and attention to detail but also there customer service is top notch. Real cool down to earth guys. I moved up to Menifee about a 45 min drive from here and was concerned I wouldn't be able to get my car worked on because RPM is so good they are always busy.  The guy at the front desk who is pretty knowledgeable btw about what most cars need told me not to worry, come down and he will take care of it. RPM over All other muffler and Exhaust shops..</Text>

Great price if you want your exhaust to rot away and fall apart after 5 years.  Shotty weld job that seemed to be done in a hurry.  Sounded great when I had pipes.  Just doesn't seem like money well spent.  I apologise to anyone who got their car dinged by my exhaust tips on the highway.</text>

Wow this shop is the real deal.. I've never had such quick performance service EVER on any of my vehicles- The shop looks legit and the work they do matches that. The welds on my exhaust are of superior craftsmanship and everything I got was what I expected and then some. There is only one place you need to go in San Diego for your exhaust needs.. RPM!< /Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>Horrible customer service! Called to get a part number for my vehicles catalytic converter and she would not give it to me she said why would I give you a part number if your not getting it fixed here. But what she didn't know was I also need a new muffler and was looking for a great shop to go too. Because of this girls customer service I will not be getting my muffler here and someone else will get my business.
such a small mindset to have "I'll only give you something if you give me business right now.." Really? Because of that thinking you now never get business from me. Change your mindset and you get more business.<//text>< gmapID>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Went in expecting to spend 400 walked out spending 1400... Somehow I'm extremely happy.

1976 Bronco with a HO well built 5.0L. my exhaust headers we're a Miss match to Bronco and not only sit on the frame causing multiple gasket blow outs, but also impeded the clutch fork from actuating fully. On top of my header problem I had installed a new transmission set up that minimized three available space to run exhaust... I decided my 110VAC mig welder was not up to the task and I brought the rig into RPM.
Richard spent some decent time under the bronco with me as we discussed what I wanted as an endstate and how I wanted to get there. New ceramic headers built for my Bronco were not good enough and Richard had his guy custom weld the flang location to provide the absolute most clearance possible. Pipes were welded great and with real precision work keeping everything tight and tucked away.
Only problem was waiting on a gasket to get delivered by the local NAPA auto store that was overlooked, put a 2 hour delay on the whole thing making the total turn around from drop off to pick up <36 hours. Pretty damn good.
If you got the money, or more importantly the love for your vehicle, RPM is the exhaust shop to use.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><userid>101522586967555290517<//userid></record>

<Time>1364070191516< /Time><text>I called a few weeks back to see about having my wife's exhaust system upgraded, and talked with a representative on the phone who was supposed to call back with some price quotes on JBA headers, but that never happened.  Not completely deterred, because of the great comments about the shop on the net, I went ahead and called them yesterday to setup an appointment today to have just the cat-back replaced (I bought the headers myself in the meantime because they never gave me a quote, and they did not apologize for failing to call me back when I asked about it).  When I called to asked for an appointment, I was told to just swing by at 0800 and that it would take about 45 minutes so I could just wait there.  I was there at about 0750 and the place was already busy.

I talked with Richard who was very knowledgeable and helpful, he recommended some things that saved me some money on the install.  When he told the Rep at the counter that I was dropping it off and leaving it I asked the rep about my call yesterday and my request for an appointment, because I was busy today...  She said "Well sorry we are too busy now, but we will have it done by the time we close, and I can call you when it is done"  I did end up having my wife pick me up but was stuck at her work for most of the morning, waiting for a call.  At about 1130, half an hour before they closed, I called them back to see what the status was since I had not received a call.  The Rep had to put me on hold to find the information and then told me "Sorry I could have called you a few hours ago when it was done"

Went to pick the truck up and no one bothered to show me the work before I paid for it, and rep at the counter did not apologize for wasting half of my day.  Very frustrated with my experience.  The shop seems to represent themselves as a small time, custom shop, but seems that they may have recently grown and are now accepting more business that they are not accustomed to, which is irritating because I came to a "custom performance exhaust shop", not a Meineke.

Overall:  Very happy with the price and the work but super frustrated with the customer service and attention to details.  I am not sure if I will go back to this shop.</text><GmapID>0x80dc713792e6b923:0x4ef2bc145d51e44c</GmapID>< rate>

<Text>Car: 2012 Mitsubishi Evolution
Work Done: Custom 3" Exhaust system (Testpipe to exhaust tips)

I needed a system in a short amount of time before getting car tuned so I found RPM. Initial impressions while going to the shop were fantastic. They were extremely helpful from the start, the PRICE was FANTASTIC and the work so far seems to be holding up great as wel. I am very happy with the system and best of all the sound.
I wanted it a bit quieter as well so I had them install a second resonator --- was in and out in 30 minutes.

From my personal experience it was a fantastic shop and highly recommend to anyone looking to get some exhaust work.

<Text>Just had an aftermarket midpipe installed on my BMW 135i.  70 bucks out the door.  Took a little longer than I was expecting but there were a few people ahead of me so no big deal.   These muffler shops have the tendency to focus on american muscle and trucks, so i am sometimes hesitant to take my car to somewhere other than my independent or the dealer.  I was also a little concerned that they might try to charge me more because I drive a BMW but they charged the same price as my buddy's Nissan.  Overall I would use them again when I get the aftermarket muffler on.  Great customer service and good pricing.   Definitely recommended< /Text><Name>Nick Hazleton<//Name>< rating>

Right now it is where you pick up your food at that you have ordered online from the restaurant part of Canter's. The man who was running it was very helpful and we got our food fast! It is usually the lounge part of Canter's.<//review>

<Text>Definitely my favorite dive bar in the city. The juke box is always playing great music, the drinks are cheap (albeit a little heavy on the mixer), and the popcorn is second to none. Definitely not for everyone but I have always had a great time here.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

I loved the pizza though! It comes with two very runny eggs cooked sunny side up. It was honestly a little hard to grab the slices due to the yolk, but it was worth it as the half cooked egg just melted it my mouth. There was a generous amount of Kibitz Room at Canter's that paired well with the tomato sauce and the thin crust.

<rating>5</rating><text>After living in L.A. for 50 years, I finally went to Canter's...twice this year. It looks pretty much like it's 50+ years old, which it is at least  You know, there aren't that many restaurants around that have their original atmosphere, interiors, decor, and menu from another era.  Menu is updated, but the experience is still mid-century nostalgia.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Awesome dive with happy hour specials, open mic nights, live music, and food is served from Canter's Deli kitchen up till 7pm. Fun spot to go with a group of friends to grab drinks. Very eclectic crowd. Check it out, it's a historic bar. Bands like the Doors, The Byrds, Guns N Roses, and The Wallflowers have hung out and played there.</text>

If you like deli meat, do yourself a favor and get the Fairfax and ask for Russian mustard on the side.</Review>

I feel fine in this shabby dark and dusty dive.Very comfy...however when I showed the tender my bottle of Coke and offered him five dollars for a glass of ice to pour it in he stared at me as if I were holding a dripping knife. Then threw me out of my beloved dive. Did he overreact?<//Text>

<review>Classic deli.  Went to shoot a documentary on jazz, left with pastrami and swiss cheese.

Guys behind the counter really friendly (if you have the right attitude) and we chatted for a while about the more exotic game one can eat.< /review><resp>None< /resp><date>1472621548348</date><pics>None< /pics>< gmapID>

<text>I love coming here. Everyone is trying their best to make donors feel comfortable and to get them out as fast as possible for donors convenience. Kellen makes me feel so comfortable and she always makes sure to explain the process. I always hope to see Kellen there,  she truly knows what she is doing. Thank you to the wonderful staff who work hard everyday.< /text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Although I'm a regular donor, meaning I donate atleast twice a month, these people confuse the hell out of me! First they say to "donate every other day" yet when I went to donate for a third time in one week, they turned me down. They claim they need my second donation or they can't use the first donation, but won't take my third? Senseless.</Text>

0 stars not 1 star.
This place horrible. The good reviews for this place are complete BS. Either it’s someone who is related or is a friend of someone who works there. Or some kind of favorite donor. An to say that the staff have no favorites is a lie. I’ve watched them manually change a donors information so that they’ll pass an watch them fail others. I’ve seen them set up donors for the beginning of the donation or finalization of it while making others wait. A lot of them are undertrained in the process of inserting the needle into the vein or setting up the machine to withdraw the plasma. I know people who’ve stopped going cause they don’t feel the money is worth the pain they have to go through. Plus the employees are never truly following any sort of COVID-19 safety procedures. I always see masks half on or being taken off. Around other employees or donors. An forget about the 6 foot social distance when it comes to the masks. What is management working from home? Some an I only mean a very small handful are good at their work an are very polite. But most are not. I thought it was nice doing this, helping people an being compensated for my donation. An this extra money I was getting every week was basically just gas money or just money to put aside for a rainy day. But honestly it’s not worth the grief anymore.</Review>

Clean and professional, It can have long waiting times i belive once it took me a little over 2 hours but just like the freeway don't take it during rush hours if you can and you'll be fine. It 15min on pre check up and 45min during the donation.
Tip: drink plenty of water and it'll reduce the donation time period.< /text>

<text>I have gone as many times as I could! I Get there before they open to limit my waiting time. I sometimes take a coffee and snack. There is a security guard that greets you and you enter to the computers. It takes 5 minutes, then get to the nurse station to weigh, test my blood protein, etc. another 5-10 minutes. Then goin into the donation room, I get seated, reclined.. I always forget my head phones... there are TVs. Then another nurse will come over and apply iodine and needed supplies to get started . Once the needle is in your vein, it is a process. If I eat well and drink a lot of water the day prior, 24 minutes... if I choose to eat bad, 2 hours and possibility of not qualifying for money. I have met people that have gone for years and have put themselves they college, bought cars, it’s an incredible opportunity... a win, win win.... you have golden blood my friend!<//text>< Pics>

The staff are nice and friendly but, a d this is a big "but", only 3 or 4 of them actually do work like they're suppose to. The rest of the staff spend most of the time talking to each other or to donors. It pains me to say these things but someone has to.< /Review>

This is a great place to go when you're are low on cash or in-between pay checks. The front of the house is kind and friendly. Jr usually does my intake and he's great!!!! The floor staff is kind as well. When the center is very busy they all tend to talk more, not sure why that is. Some staff members are more skilled and confident when it comes to venipuncture, so don't be afraid to request someone in particular.</text>

Rude staff. I went in with my new baby, not aware that kids aren't allowed in. The lady at the counter was nice, but the other lady I had to speak to about my child being there was very ryde. She gave me a face and acted as if I didn't belong there! I didn't feel welcomed at all.< /Review>

<text>Since. Like the more you go the longer the wait time is..😡if  you will get there at 2pm you get to back  around 4 then wait for the slowest   peoples to come just to stick you either come early  in the morning  or come a 6:50 PM sadly that when they work faster to get you in and out  HIRE NEW PEOPLE  AND SHORT THE TIME  WAIT !  This why I stop coming  for a while  its getting  really ridiculous  when you begin coming for a  cool minute  and still   have wait 5 hours just like you new all over again.  Really  considering changing to a  new place<//text>< response>

<text>My first time donating, i had a very pleasant experience due to how polite and informative the staff are. They made sure i was aware, and made me feel very comfortable. Im understanding of the wait time and popularity and i recommend heading in at 6am.
Upon realizing that after your first 5 donations or so, they set you on a lower compensation rate of $25-35. So, hours of my time, stabbing me multiple times with a needle, and only receiving $25 for a vial of $500-1000 worth of plasma? No, I'm done here. This company is a true wolf, to those who need the money. 2 stars because the staff is decent(some). Other wise I'm done with Octapharma. Please, dont waste your time here for $50 a week. Its an awful process. It's not worth it. They don't tell you about the $25-35 compensation after this first 5. Please be aware.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Clean facility and wonderful staff. There's a wait sometimes, but it's for a good cause and you're compensated for your time. I've been coming twice a week for the last 4 months and will continue to keep going.<//review>

This was the managers work. I got there at 8am didn’t leave until 1pm. They let people go in front of me even though it was my first time there. Plus they only gave me $50 instead of $75 for my first time. Had to call them so they could fix it. The guy with the red hair, the manager does not know what he is doing. Scarring traumatic experience.< /review>

Some of the staff are not very professional their attitudes came off a bit rude and honestly I wanted to just donate as a way to give back.. Remind the staff whatever personal issues they are having not to be unkind to others.. I am still going to donate plasma but definitely at a more professional friendly environment and location...<//text>

<review>I recently came back, l was considered a new donor. I took it for granted that it was a professional ,honest & that they stood by integrity. I called my card ,just see how much  of my new donor $ l had left & how much! I was troubled it seemed l got 50$ the last x l was there.As l listened to my card activity it said l had been paid only 25$ the last 2 x’s.I did ask the lady if l was getting my 75$ ,she informed not until the next l went.Well l went & l only got 50$. In the past l did correct the worker because l noticed that l wasn’t get paid what they said  l would.My apologies if l misunderstood.Yolanda Velarde<//review>< pics>

I’ve been coming here since 2016. It’s very clean and neat. All the nurses are friendly and professional . Junior is friendly and always asks “how are you doing today “ when I arrive. It’s very nice to be treated well. I recommend this place to everyone who’s not afraid of needles, lol. Come check it out...$75 on first visit! New people, come help save lives & make instant money! *****<//Text>

The only guy really smiling and all happy with very exceptional friendly service was Chris. Yes it's true some of the staff seem like they are all depressed just avoid them and talk to the more chill people here. Every place will has it's pros and cons and this place has Quiana&Chris as their Professionals. Make sure to ask for him when you come in on early mornings I love the guy always making jokes uplifting mood compared to the other workers!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

It is true that some of the staff memebers on the donation floor choose to take their time assisting the heavy lines. They work without a sense of urgency. 🤷<//Review>< Gmap_id>

<text>Takes to long. the workers dont care about us. They just care about the money. They take there sweet time. The only thing good about this place is they pay $75 the first donation witch is a ripoff because they sell two bottles of plasma for $1000. It should be $75 everytime.< /text><rating>1<//rating>< GmapID>

<text>The nurses can get disrespectful. I don't recommend this place, The workers know it's not in the donors best interest to get disrespectful or to assault them. they take advantage and get a kick out of making you angry. The nurses don't have to watch what they say or do. Not all the nurses tho most of them are really good people.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Review>Been coming here for years. Today they are really busy and some days are slower than others. I have never had any problem with someone sticking me. I don’t like that when you have to do an annual you do the process over like re-reading and watching the video. They make you do everything over except pay you like a new Donor for that day. Sometimes they are really under staffed. Haven’t had any problems with the staff. I love Perrin, Sandra, Sam, David, Lauren, Marisa and Julie.<//Review><date>1550530024427<//date>< Pictures>

If you're there on a Sunday prepare for a long wait unless you coming super early in the AM or coming for the first time for the first time prepare to wait up to and over 5 hours ! Had to let Management know about stocking the restroom with soap, keeping it clean and having things like seat covers. But soap of all things I had l tell a medical facility about being clean and killing bacteria and having your hands clean as patients AND your male staff. Finally got fixed months later even tho seat covers are not stocked consistently.< /review>< Pics>

Overall pleasant first experience.  David up front was super kind and helpful.  Robin was an amazing phlebotomist, I didn't even feel the needle go in.  The only reason for 4 stars instead of five was that I think first timers need to be given written instructions upon leaving.  I felt fine when I left but within 30 minutes was extremely nauseated and sweaty.  I ate and rehydrated and feel better, but I think there needs to be something giving discharge instructions.</Text>
<Response>{'time': 1541539697670, 'text': 'Hi Ashlee, Thank you for sharing your feedback and for the high star review. While most people experience little to no side effects from donating plasma, you should consult with your personal physician about any concerns. After your donation, drink plenty of water or juice to help replenish liquids in your body. Eat foods rich in protein and iron to give your body the supplemental nutrition it needs. You should also avoid strenuous exercise, tobacco use, and alcohol immediately following your donation. Your body needs time to rest and recover.

3rd time donating arrived at 8:00 am and was still in line at 10:45 did not donate since i had to be at work soon and do not plan on coming back as its literally not worth the time, I dont mind helping others out but when their is 3 to 5 hour wait makes you think twice. I do not believe its the staff fault as most of them are professional and actually care and try. The problem is they are severly understaffed. They have 6 sections only 4 were open with 1 person in each. The crazy part is they were not even busy only about 10 people arrived after me within those 3 hours and somehow line had barely moved. They need to make some make some major changes soon, if i was in line for 3 hours and still was not seated while the center was basically empty i cant imagine how long that wait would be if they were actually busy. If you are thinking of donating i suggest you find a entirely different company to donate to if it's this bad at this center I doubt the others are any better.< /Text>

< Review>
I am a longtime donor (over 10 years plus)  visited other plasma facilities, and this one is far and away the best; and concern always for the best interest of the donors; cannot, please everybody all the time and some people none of the time. Finally,  the only complaint would be, that I wish that Octapharma would retain their employees longer  (bye Nahley, and Carley), but  they trained their padawa well; master Marissa is my favorite now.</Review>

The staff at this location are almost all courteous and helpful, even with some rude donors they maintain their composure.  The facilities are clean and there are plenty of beds.  The donation process is not complicated but because of the high volume of donors there can be a somewhat of a wait.  You're saving lives with a bonus of some payment for your blood.  If you have no fear of needles then this is a great place to donate.</Text>

I've been coming here since October 2015 and have never had problems with the old and new locations. Staff is and always has been very friendly. Longest I've been there (not including my first visit where you register basically) was 3 hours, but that was due to my own complications. They also provide movies so that's pretty great! I only recommend bringing a jacket or a blanket because it gets cold.< /Text>

Very rude women working here. Threatened to remove me because I checked the time in my phone as the nurse was finishing up with my vitals. In no way was this action interfering with the process as stated it would be an interference for taking vitals. Well right before I checked my phone I had already been hooked up to the blood pressure machine for one cycle in which the machine set a code and I had to re-do the process.. all in which the nurse was not being courteous and i know if she was in my shoes the shoe wouldn't fit. P.s. it wasn't busy so it wasn't like the had any reason for an attitude.<//text>

You need to hire better employees and have set times for things this is ridiculous. I've been to other facilities and this is by far the worst<//Text>< UserId.>

<review>The wait is much too long they have an uneven amount of workers  too many in the front not enough in the back or the other way around and the system in the morning is terrible instead of using all the beds they try and keep it all in the same sections you you can easily be skipped over or wait about an hour longer as I am now I am currently past my second hour on to my third and I was skipped over so if you're thinking you would like to donate here don't I would not recommend if I'm able to give 0 stars I would therefore 1 would have to do</review>< pics>

I had a frustrating experience this last time. After having my vitals done, I was seated in a seat by itself at the end of a row, and then forgotten about. Though there were at least 15 people behind me before the doors locked at 7, I was the 2nd to last to get stuck. There were no issues. I did not get up to use the restroom or anything, yet I did not even have a sheet with a number on it for over half an hour. I watched the staff go to the sheets over and over again, pull the names in their rows, and leave the rest,(where mine sat for a long time). WHAT HAPPENED TO GOING IN ORDER? The whole thing made me want to stop coming.

Ps. Now changing my review to 1 star. These young people talk far more than actually work, which leaves people like me waiting forever, even when there was no wait out front. Ridiculous!!!!!! Go back to high school if you miss it so much.< /review>

This is the worst place.... their staff and management are very rude disrespectful and not helpful. I don't even want to give one star but you have to to write a review... SHELLA is very disrespectful for her to be an assistant manager her people skills are very disappointing... today is the worst visit I had one of their phlebotomist messed my vain up and didn't even offer help when I was in pain they just left me sitting there and stuck me in my other arm... this place is very disappointed if you haven't been I suggest you find another place to go because this isn't the place at all...</review>

Went in as a new donor , that was like a 3 1/2 hour process ! The staff that handled me were pretty nice & the place was pretty clean , the only bad things I would say is that the bathroom was disgusting; absolutely deplorable! Also I waited on the bed for like an additional 45 minutes to even start the donation process , the staff were too busy talking to get me started! Also when I was done I explained to them that the needle was hurting me & that it was burning & for someone to please take it out , despite my out right complaints , it took someone 10 minutes to come remove the needle from my arm !</text>

<text>I've been coming here or 6 months and it's been a decent experience. The facility is very clean (incredibly cold so bring a jacket or blanket!) and the staff has been nice and patient when helping me, I have not received any rude staff members as others have complained about.

You will wait a few hours on your first visit, so go on a day where you have absolutely nothing planned because you can wait from 4-6 hours although they tell you 2-4. Also, they can and will disqualify you for issues as small as asthma. So, ASK them first if you have medical issues before waiting so long. I've seen so many angry people scream and run out that door because they were disqualified after HOURS of waiting. ASK FIRST BEFORE WAITING!

Now Complaints...
They do seem understaffed on some days. The line will be going out the door which I really don't mind, it's when I'm finished that it's irritating. There were days where everyone would be finished at different times, and holding their hand up in their air ready leave for 20 minutes+ before staff came around. By then, EVERYONE begins to shout and claim that they were done first and whoever is the loudest or the closest to that staff member wins the game. If they had more staff members on the floor or even a number system instead of the hand raising thing, it would be less hostile and easier for both the donor and staff member.

My other complaint is some of the donors who go there. I've dealt with some short tempered hostile donors who try to fight for their place in line or fight to get unhooked from the IV and leave first, sometimes with me and sometimes with the staff. For the most part people are respectful but some of them are cranky and impatient and treat this place like it's there to only SERVE THEM but there's not really any way to avoid 'em.!</text>< name>

I love this place. Friendly staff. Very professional. Phlebotomist are very nice. Express service. Bonuses are fair. The building is very clean and sanitized. In my opinion management should be more involved with greeting the donors in the building. Sam dose an amazing job here. She made my stay here warm and plesent. I had had a wonderful time here donating and will be back.<//review>

Usually Octapharma is a very nice and professional place to donate, but the  last few days I came in and try to donate and it was a nightmare including today. I waited over two hours lying in a bed waiting to get stick with a needle. I had to be at work at 2 so around 12:45 I look up and seen only two workers on the floor that was actually sticking donors and a long line damn there out the door with donors waiting for a bed.  My advice quit accepting new donors when you got a long line of current donors waiting to donate, and have more employees on hand to handle the volume towards the end of the month.  Thanks</review>

Very slow service I went in today for regular donation, all was good until the screener put in the wrong information moving to fast, I was then told that I wouldn't be able to to donate and was sent away when it was their error. This place sucks badly should be closed down poor staffing. I recooreco Biomat plasma, Grifols is way better.<//text>

<Review>Octapharma plasma is a good place to earn extra money when needed and the staff is nice and friendly the location is clean but if you are less the150lb then it's really not worth it you only get $15.00 it pays more for those who are smaller to go donatie on highland but past that it's a great place<//Review><user>110088576711952531191</user><Response>None</Response>< pictures>

I arrived to an empty room...There was no line and it took over 3 hrs just to get a simple vital. 3hrs later I watched the room get packed with ppl and I’m just getting my vitals on the express lane. I’ve been coming here since the mtvernon location and for it to be empty this was the worst experience. Please hire more staff, two hrs later and I had to force myself to stay longer because of my busy schedule and time wasted...get newer younger nurses PLEASE :UPDATE-left at 8:30 WORST THAN GOING TO A HOSPITAL 2-8:30 that’s almost 7hrs.

A first-time donation can take longer because of the initial donor suitability screening – including your medical history and an extensive health questionnaire.

Way understaffed, takes so long it's truly ridiculous. The money isn't horrible but if you come at night expect to stay around 3 hours. If you get here early when they start it's not horrible but this business is run extremely inefficient, staff has no sense of urgency and like I said stupidly understaffed.< /text>

<Review>They only get one star because you get payed if I could show the bruise on my boyfriends arm you guys would not want to attend here. They’re not only understaff but they have staff that do not know what they are doing. Some can’t find a vein or stick it to deep etc it’s a mess. A mess I went and didn’t go back my boyfriend went back and his arm started to swell he told the lab nurse and they took it out and said they will still pay him I’m annoyed because it’s unprofesssional to not be considerate of people’s lives he said she was rushing to because it was the end of shift please don’t go here and if you do there is a short older lady with short silver hair (caucasians) sort of loud but funny she does a very good job actually has experience.</Review>< Gmap_id>

First I would like to point out how all the responses from octapharma pertain to how "hard" they are working in the problem areas. I don't believe that one bit. The process should take no more than hour but takes almost 2 EVERY TIME. Do NOT come here. It's literally a nightmare wait. Yes the staff are friendly but time management is HORRIBLE!!! Octapharma please do not respond with a BS "I'M SORRY WE ARE WORKING HARD TO..." If you were then these complaints would still not be going on.</review>

This place is a nightmare. They don't do anything but talk, the place is gross, and they have messed up twice while drawing blood, causing the vein to collapse and severe bruising. After all the pain and soreness they would only put $5 on the card because she couldn't stick the needle in right.<//Text>

Been going here for 5 months, and the very last time I went, I couldn't believe how things ended up. They said I couldn't donate, because of one little scratch, on my arm(they are keeping from trying to reach my promotion which pays me 50 instead of the 25 I make constantly. At this center, they will use any excuse, to not let you donate. So I was out of luck, no bus money or anything. I was charging my phone in the restroom, and I left it their for a minute, and I come back, some guy, stole my phone, that fast. The crazy part about it, is that, the security guard seen him take it(he was using restroom at the same time phone got taken), and he didn't even want to help me point out the guy. To top it off, The nurses, at the front desk, were laughing at me, because It was a government phone, and they assume I can just get another one, Their supposed to be working and enjoying there job helping people and working with people not talking down on someone that's going through a struggle. Yes I am a struggle, and I donate, because I need the money. But my experience at this donation center, was so horrible, I would advise any one, to not go here, and go to GCAM, they have very good reviews. I am defiantly going to transfer my profile, to their center.

<Review>I have been donating at Octapharma regularly for about 4-6 months now. My time spent there has been a largely enjoyable experience. The staff is friendly and courteous, and this really says something considering how over-worked they are.

They could use more phlebotomists, but the ones there really know their stuff. And if you find a tech that you really like, they actually let you make requests. So if your favorite needle wizard is on duty, don’t be afraid to ask for their services.

Their registration while lengthy is actually streamlined so once you return the process goes much faster. This is of course all required by law and anyone criticizing them for this part of the procedure is simply ignorant of the fact that the staff & management cannot change this. Yes they are going to be collecting some very personal information, and yes some of your answers or a combination of them may disqualify you from donating… Boo hoo.

This is not a retail service; you are not entitled to customer satisfaction. It is the staff’s foremost concern to protect the well being of their clients, and those who may be receiving donated plasma. For that reason they have to calculate the risk or chance that you may have some kind of disqualifying condition. Maybe your blood pressure is too low, too high, or maybe you engaged in & admitted to certain high risk behaviors. Either way, no one should be throwing daggers at an organization for complying with safety laws.

Wait times can be pretty long, but they are honest and forthright about this, telling every new customer that they can expect it to take between 2 and 3 hours. This is again, due to a lack of phlebotomists, and the popularity of this location. They are routinely swamped, with lines of beds full of people waiting their turn to get stuck. This is yet another thing that they as the company cannot control. They cannot wave a magical wand and produce a new tech with the same astounding level of skill I’ve come to expect, nor can they banish the crowds of people that show up every day.

So yes the service, entirely because of circumstance, may be a little slow, but the quality is amazing.

The facilities are, well, unremarkable, but what do you expect, it’s a donation center. But it’s always very clean, and there are televisions positioned all around so you can always see one from any bed.

Their movie selection could use some serious, serious improvement however.</Review><user_id>113187095907647405660< /user_id>< Rate>

<Review>Horrible.  Rules change daily and half of the employees are lazy. Understaffed and refuse to hire so youre waiting fprever. Employees just enjoy chatting to each other. Machines are in need of cleaning and being fixed. With the exception of 3 employees the rest are rude. Donation prices change monthly and it isnt explained well whatsoever. Basically $25 for the first 5 donations then it can go to 30,35, and maybe 40 if your check in person pays attention.<//Review>< pics>

As the line picks up the staff have no sense off urgency to bring the line back down. then once im in a chair im waiting 30 minutes for my whole setion to fill up before they start sticking people. I only take 35 min to complete donation but with the waiting its takes 2 hours min. to get in and out<//text>< name>

<Text>sh*tty customer service sh*tty pay and they like to defer people. they will only allow 2 donations a week so dont try going every other day. they want to pay the least amount for our donations, the whole setup is to get your plasma for as cheap as they can so they can make 99% profit. keep in mind most of the people that work there have not passed there exam yet so expect to bleed out or have a fewadjustments and resticks.<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>I called on the phone and asked if it was ok to bring Amazon envelope to verify my address they said ok, I provided everything required, they checked it, I waited 2 hours for them to bring me in the back room, then another lady checked my envelope again and turn me away because it didn't have the prefix "JR" on my name matching the ID, I think it was very petty they didn't catch this when I first showed up and instead of letting me know right off the bat when I arrived they made me wait for 2 hours for no reason and then insisted on mailing me a postcard, when I told them everything "OK" when I arrived and was not made aware there would be a problem, they went to check with the employee who checked me in and she was conveniently "out to lunch" very disappointed in this place and will be going elsewhere.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I didn't know what I was walking into when I signed up for the 6 week challenge. I was nervous to start something new in my life but It was the best decision I ever made!
I finished my 6 week challenge and by far my experience at qfitbootcamp has been exceptional! Never have I walked into a gym before and felt comfortable about working out. The coaches are all AMAZING! Coach Yvette and Coach Elissa are there with you motivating you throughout the workout; it's the best! All the coaches genuinely want to see you achieve your goal!<//Review>

<Text>Qfitbootcamp has given my body a total transformation. My lifestyle has improved dramatically because I've had the support to get healthy and because the classes are effective and fun! The coaches here genuinely care about your progress and want to see you succeed. They check in with you to help you stay accountable through many different methods (weigh ins, measurements, body fat percentage), give constant advice and feedback, and help you understand how to change your lifestyle through meal prep suggestions, mindfulness, and kick butt exercise. I truly enjoy coming here on a daily basis. Richard truly cares about you and your habits and provides the information and feedback you need to succeed.  Michael has the gift of motivation and gets to know you so that he understands how to push you to become your best self.  He is truly an amazing trainer. Sandy, Dominique, and Josh are all trainers that love what they do and bring their amazing positive energy and fun personalities to every class. The team here has all that you need to succeed. You just have to come with some determination and a willingness to not give up.< /Text>< Pictures>

Love this gym and staff. You do not feel alienated like the big commercial gyms. The workouts, environment and access to coaches is great. If you come to this gym, come with a purpose and goal and the coaches will help you achieve it. 👍</text>

<review>Great fitness place!  Love the Coaches and personal training.  No extra charge for the personal training or nutrition advice.  Worth the monthly charge.  7 days free trial.  This is someone who hated going to the gym, love this place.< /review>< time>

I used to love going to qfit.  They were always pricey compared to other gyms.  Then there was a change after they got voted best in high desert.  They started charging more and more.  The small group they offered was $150 for twice a week which is ridiculous.  I actually left a couple months ago.  When I signed my cancellation Michael was rude to me.  Now my friend told me they upped there prices again and gave everyone a 3 days notice.  Mostly everyone quit and today they let go there best trainer.  The owners are nothing but money hungry.  Not only that but it's a very toxic enviroment.  I am glad I left and went to legends.  Save money and go somewhere else.<//Text>

<Review>I started going to Qfit on October 2016 and was nervous to start something new.  When I got there the environment was friendly and welcoming. Coach Richard was real helpful getting me started with everything I needed to know. Coach Michael is a great coach who has a great attitude everyday. The coaches are quick to respond when I have any questions I have regarding nutrition or any other concern. I am so glad I started because it truly has changed my life.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

It's more than a gym! The coaches here are motivational and want you to reach and surpass your goals. They teach/train you to live a healthier lifestyle and make exercising fun -- constant support/guidance from the staff. I wish I could give more than 5 stars.</text>

I will be forever grateful to the QFit family! This was the first time EVER that I was able to start a health/fitness plan and see it through till the end. I did the 6 week challenge to help get motivated to taking better care of myself. I felt like I had lost myself along the way somewhere over the years. I’m a foster parent with a full time job and during week 2 of the 6 week challenge we were placed with a special needs infant. It was difficult to say the least. We now had 4 boys at home that required a lot of love and attention and I thought my workouts were going to have to be put on the back burner. However, I really wanted to see this through so I talked with some of the staff about my struggles and they supported me and cheered me on!

With the help of the AMAZING coaches here who greet you by name, workout alongside you while correcting your form and technique, create an individualized easy to follow nutrition plan and guide that is super simple and inexpensive, (and also picked up my crying baby and held him for the duration of the class so I could focus on my workout/goal 🙌💞) ...Thanks to them and this wonderful program I was able to reach my fitness goal! They go above and beyond and I feel they genuinely want to see you reach your goals! They held me accountable and motivated me with in person check ins, texts, emails and phone calls which is exactly what I needed! In 6 weeks I lost 5% body fat and 13.5 pounds!!! QFit bootcamp literally changed my life! And it can change yours too. Don’t hesitate to give them a try. You won’t regret it!

(Special thank you to Tabitha, Michael, Yvette, and Alyssa! You guys were personally a huge part of me getting to where I am and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for all you do at QFit)< /review>

<Text>Qfitbootcamp is more then a fitness center. It's my family! I came here 8 months ago expecting to try it for 3 free days. The coaches and the ladies are awesome. So friendly and we all have the same goal. Since starting my journey I have lost 23 pounds. I'm not finished yet! Thank you qfitbootcamp for changing my life and making me want to be better everyday!< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80c36623013fdfc9:0x9d6fe46bcac04fe3< /Gmap_id><Time>1498100395142</Time>< rating>

I just finished my six week challenge here at Q fit to camp.  I’ve always struggled with my weight since I was young. Yes I’ve tried going to other gyms yes I’ve tried dieting. I did all the impossible things to lose weight. And still was not seeing results I wanted. But there was always something missing that I was lacking in .  Consistency. YES  consistency is one in many key components in getting get results! I wanna thank this Gym personally for the experience in helping me reach my goal. I’v gain how to eat healthier, but overall to live a healthier life style !!!< /review>

Been with qfitbootcamp for almost 2 years now. Richard the owner is always there if you have questions or need additional help. The trainers just want you to succeed and push you to do your best. This place has a wonderful welcoming atmosphere to all levels of fitness. I have personally grown my endurance and have even surprised myself with my strength and willpower. Qfit is wonderful and just I love my fitness family!! 2 years strong!</Review>

I had been "trying" to loose weight for 7 months  and was never motivated to get up and do something about it. After going to qfitbootcamp for one week i became obsessed. No one there judges you by how much you weigh.  if you are struggling to do a workout so many of the  members and  the trainers  help you. I lost 4 pounds the first week and now i also am noticing my clothes are fitting me differently. I am so happy to say i am going to continue going back!<//text>

<Text>I just completed my 6 week challenge and man! Let me tell you, I've never been so motivated and proud of myself. QFit has seriously changed my life for the better! I've gained so much insight and knowledge on what to workout for my body to lose weight and what to eat for my body to stay HEALTHY! The coaches are so amazing and there for you each step of the way, it is a great feeling whenever you walk into a place of fitness and feel like family rather than a stranger and feeling self conscious. I was on the fence at first but I am SO glad I was able to participate in such a beneficial, powerful and rewarding bootcamp such as QFit! Highly recommend this location for any ladies searching for a new, healthy and positive chapter in their lives.💖</Text></record></dataset><record>

I've been a member at Qfitnessbootcamp for about 2 months now, and I have noticed my strength progressing in such little time as I have at a regular gym in the past in 1year! The coaches are amazing to say the least and really push you to be the best you could be. Pushing us through our workouts when they know we need it, as well as always giving us nutritional advise when needed. It really is a total package at this gym, and I see myself being part of the qfitnessbootcamp fam for a LONG time. Thank you coach Michael, Sally and Richard! 💪🏻😀< /text>

Qfit bootcamp changed my life!!! The coaches are awesome!! I suffer from bad knees and they modify the routines in order for me to be able accomplish my goals. Coach Richard truly cares for all the members and takes his time giving us helpful advice to have a healthy lifestyle. Coach Michael, coach Sandy, coach Josh and coach  Dominique push you to not give up and they make you feel comfortable. All the ladies push each other and they don't make you feel out of place. I can truly say that this is my happy place!! I would recommend qfit bootcamp to anybody!!! Best bootcamp in the HD and I have gone to a few! Thank you Richard and all the coaches for doing such an awesome job!</Text>

<user_name>Teresa Williamson<//user_name><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Text>I reached a point in my life where I decided I couldn’t stand how overweight I was. I chose QFit Bootcamp because it wasn’t the typical gym and it’s for women only.  The last thing I wanted to do was be self-conscious about my looks. At QFit you don’t have to figure out what exercises go with what muscle groups and whether you’re doing the right routines to hit all areas of your body.  QFit does it for you; just show up and work out at your own pace and level at each station of the circuit. Richard Parga is also about providing information on nutrition, health and motivation.  Michael Ramirez and Dominique Ramirez are awesome as persons and coaches, they push you to do your best, but don’t overstep.  I started January 2 and have been consistent in going and have lost 20 pounds, 9 inches overall and 2% body fat – oh and I’m 54 years young. I highly recommend QFit Bootcamp.< /Text>< Date>

<Text>Jennifer fixed my hair! I bleached my hair and it turned green and I couldn't get it out on my own. She had her work cut out for her with my hair but she got it all to one even tone and a nice blonde then I though it would be! I am so happy with the way it looks!!</Text><UserId.>111481815948865250406< /UserId.></record></dataset><record>

My daughter got her hair cut today by Christal Nuce and she was AMAZING with my daughter. She was so nice and chatted with me the entire time while chatting with my daughter. I will definitely be going back not just for my daughter but for myself.</Review>

<text>DARRIEN took four hours to do nothing to my hair, first she was 25 minutes late, then told me that the Brown would stand out really good against my blonde hair then she forgot to put in the blonde throughout the weave halfway through, on top of that she kept asking the same questions over and over like she never listened to my response in the first place, charged me $95 to have no brown in my hair because it was basically the same color of my blonde hair and my roots are still showing in the front and I have orange splotches throughout the sides. I called and spoke to the owner for my money back, she said I would have to come in and talk to DARRIEN about that, DARRIEN said she could only give me 60 back because she gave me a haircut and styled it. The haircut was very mediocre and the style was rushed in like five minutes because she took so long and  I had to hurry and get home. The owner is fantastic and very knowledgeable and wonderful. I'm writing this review because I am so tired of hairstylists Who don't listen in the first place and or try to cover up their mistakes with some stupid story,  and then overcharge for their bull crap work they did. The three stars are only for the owner and her shop.   I do not recommend getting your hair done by DARRIEN! Obviously the review posted right after mine is someone trying to back up her crappy work. Once again this review is not about the owner, her shop or anybody else who works in the shop it's about my experience and what had happened with who did my hair and how it turned out.< /text><date>1492708792692</date>< Pics>

Dan did a great job - fast, efficient, and gave me some useful tips to help keep my carpeting clean and extend its life. He even removed a large stain that had been present for a couple of years. Very pleased!</Text>

Absolutely the best service that I have received for carpet cleaning.  We have used Van's carpet cleaning regularly for the last 6 years and we have always been satisfied with their work.  Very friendly and courteous also.< /text>

Van's Chem-Dry did an amazing job on my carpets. I have had my carpets cleaned by other companies and yet they NEVER got them as clean as Van's. I appreciated the close attention to detail and of course the cleanliness of my carpets. Worth every dime spent. Will be using Van's for all future needs.< /review>

Worked better than 3 different steam cleaning services. And the clean is lasting longer. I think it was a bit more money but the guy was working on carpet longer too. We have an old carpet that got dirty again really fast. Vans chem dry is definitely a better option. As a bonus it’s less toxic and we may not need to clean it as often!<//text>

OMG. These guys are awesome!  My sunroom was so badly stained by dog urine and poop and smelled so disgusting I thought there was no hope of ever seeing it clean again. The rest of the house had urine spots as well. Everything looks brand new again. I wish I had taken before and after pictures so you could see the amazing difference. It took 2 guys to do the job. Rod, the owner, and Dan worked so hard. I’ll never use another company!  Love, love, love my carpets now!<//review>

Rod from Van’s Chem Dry was professional and efficient and he did a great job on our carpets. He also made helpful recommendations about how to keep our carpets clean through the year. The receptionist was very friendly when scheduling and was able to offer us a next day appointment which was both unexpected and appreciated. We will definitely use Van’s Chem Dry in the future.< /review>

I've used Vans Chem Dry for several years, I've been pleased every time, people are friendly, and helpful.  Carpets always look wonderful and I like the fact that carpets are completely dry in about 3 hours.  I will continue to use Vans Chem Dry.< /Text>

The Chem-Dry process is eco-friendly and that is important to me.  It's also nice that the time to dry out the carpet is just a couple hours so I don't have to move furniture around all day so the carpet will dry.  Definitely recommend these guys!</review>

We love the Chem-Dry process. We really like the fact that they are environmentally conscious in the way they clean. We've never been disappointed and would highly recommend Van's Chem-Dry to anyone wanting a superior carpet cleaning experience. 5 Stars!</Text>

< Review>
Julia was wonderful in getting my husband and I new iPhone 12’s.  She spent the necessary time with us and answered all of our questions.  She was very knowledgeable and efficient.  On a rare occasion, if she didn’t know the answer she found out immediately.  She is a smart young lady.  She was professional, kind and someone I would want as an employee.  She gave us her undivided attention during the whole process.  This location was out of stock but she helped us order from The Apple store for next day pick up.  Then, the next day she got out new phones all set up.  We had a great experience all due to Julia.</Review>

<Text>Robert was excellent! My phone battery died and needed either a fix or a brand new phone.. well, since Samsung doesn't make phones that you can easily fix, seemed easier to just buy a new one. And I decided to get one for my daughter's birthday too! 🎂 Robert was patient, thoughtful and even went back to see if we could find a clear case for me, but unfortunately not available. But that's OK, the customer service was fantastic.<//Text>< Pics>

Karl is a great asset to AT&T he is very knowledgeable , kind and honest. As a customer, I felt very well taken care of. He fixed the problem and encourage me to install a TV service at my home. I am blessed that I got him to be my advisor. He helped me with my phone bill payment as well. I will come to see him again! Great job Karl, thank you! Your customer Margarite</text>

Julia was amazing. I was in and out in under 30 minutes.  She was so helpful and answered all of my questions and concerns.  I have been “working”
with Apple for over 6 months to resolve my issue and gotten nowhere.  Thank you very much Julia!!!<//review>

Top notch customer service from a respectable individual. Truly demonstrated he was trying to help instead of trying to just sell us on a deal.  We have been trying to upgrade our phones and simply due to other stores disrespectful demeanor we have held off. Due to Karl’s patience answering all of our questions we will be happily upgrading our plan like he recommended and will be highly considering the other bundle options. Great work.</Review>< pictures>

<rate>5<//rate><review>I usually compare going to the ATT Store to going to the dentist, but now I have a wonderful dentist and had a great experience purchasing a new iPhone 12 Pro. I made an appointment on line and arrived a little early and Robert helped me right away. I decided on the phone and Robert did some research and helped me save some $$. I purchased a case, screen saver and adapter was free. I’m usually a little uncomfortable transferring the old phone to the new, but Robert walked me through it and I was successful! I’m going to turn in my old phone for some money off. It’s so nice to have a new phone! A great experience at the ATT Store with Robert!<//review>< pics>

This was an amazing experience. Came in and they showed me the phone, I picked it, they provided. I love the promotion; buy 2 accessories and get one free. Your going to get it anyways, so why not free. Also Marquez was amazing and extremely helpful.  Thank you so much.< /Text>

Coming into this store was the best decision I made all day! Max immediately helped me when I walked in and assisted me in every way possible! He was very thorough and explained everything he helped me with today! Jordan is the manager here and is awesome, he was very nice and assisted Max with helping me! They were both very attentive and answered all my questions. Very nice people, very professional and very nice clean store!</Text>

Steffani the store manager was incredibly knowledgeable and also supported me through the entire process. I was pleased to see how kind warm and professional they were being with all the customers that came into the store. I was ready to leave AT&T prior to tonight’s experience just due to frustration with their corporate over the phone customer service or lack of and inefficiency. Because of the caliber, intelligence, and willingness to help me they saved an important AT&T customer!<//review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< userid>

<review>When I left the store I felt Sarah had been helpful, but as it turns out she was NOT. 1. She did not sign us up for the $700 trade-in promotion and did not tell us we had to do that. 2. She told us the wrong info on the plan change she proposed. These are both major issues and I have make to an awful lot of additional phone calls etc. to get this all taken care of.<//review>< pics>

1) While we were there, they went into my wife's phone and gave themselves a 5-star rating on Google.
2) Came in to set up a wireless account. 1 week later, someone from AT&T came to our house to install home internet which we never signed up for. The salesman signed us up without our consent.
3) There was an error on our billing the first month. I went into the store to have it fixed and they told us to call AT&T Loyalty to be credited. When I spoke with Loyalty they said the store had the ability to make the change but just didn't want to do it.< /text><Date>1620937425930< /Date><rating>1< /rating></record></dataset><record>

Steffine was amazing, I had a issue with longstanding account. She went out of her way to contact the right department and find me a solution to my need immediately without a runaround or reasons why she could not help. This is the reason why I have been a loyal customer for years and will continue to be along with sharing my experience and encouraging others to become part of AT&T</Text>

<Gmap_id>0x808561c1fecd6a27:0xb3e2219b3aa87d28</Gmap_id><rate>2< /rate><Text>This is a very clean and organized store with nice displays. They can do more towards increasing accessory inventory with competitive pricing. This is a corporate store.. One important and key operational issue at this store are the employees. They are not good simply put. I've observed them the handful of times I've been there, despicable how they handle and talk to elderly customers, and lack of interest or enthusiasm towards the rest of the customers is very evident. They really need to replace them, and better customer service/sales 101. If I were to only rate the employees it would be 1 star. If you don't have an appointment they will not help you, but when you do, I've had to wait 15 min beyond my appointment time without acknowledging(very slow day), that is just poor, and unacceptable. No excuses please, its utterly irresponsible. I've seen a customer waiting get up and leave. Mind you, I've been an AT&T wireless customer for over 20 years, but am reconsidering my loyalty. Be aware of the sneaky attempts to dupe you into services that are not included in the plan, but they quickly make a statement where you perceive it as it's included in the plan(at this store).<//Text>< Pics>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Text>I headed into the store to transfer my Verizon Prepaid Service into AT&T Prepaid Service.

I was attended to very quickly by the employee, Karl, who was able to quickly and easily set me up with a new AT&T account and port my number over from Verizon.  During the entire process he was quick, polite and attentive.  I had to return to the store because data did not work, but while waiting for him to finish up with a customer the data randomly started working to is may have just needed some time.

My only real suggestion is that the associated should become more familiar with the Prepaid products offered by AT&T.  It is generally an issue with most cell phone carrier retail store employees though so I did not take away any stars.  It is why I do research and know exactly what I want when going to transfer my service.</Text>< Resp>

Myself and hubby went to upgrade our iphones and Julia was the ATT assistant who help helped us from telling us what are the offers and phones etc. she was very patient and clear in giving us all the details and what would expect in terms of monthly billing.

He really went above and beyond to assist me. I’m not tech savvy at all and he did EVERYTHING for me! Also, he explained the upgrade process and current promotions very clearly. He always asked me if I understood what he explained and if I didn’t he would re-explain it to me again but in a different way. He was even gentle when my husband was overwhelming him with questions. He’s a great multitasker! I appreciated his patience and kindness towards me and especially my husband 🙊 Thank you so much Luis! You provided excellent customer service and even though I live in Stockton, I will continue to drive to Walnut Creek (1 hour away) to get answers/assistance from you. I can’t wait to see you grow in your position and get promotions. Until we see each other again 👋🏼< /Review>< Pictures>

Immediately walking in the store I could see that the local staff cared about customer safety. I had the pleasure of working with Karl who was amazing. I was there to upgrade two phones...he walked me through every step.  Took the time to explain the options, cost and what I would be paying today versus each month. He offered up services he thought would be helpful without the high pressure to buy.   He is knowledgeable and patient with my many questions. I was able to set up my phone before I left the store...which seems simple but I had phone and cloud storage issues.  Thank you Karl and AT&T team for making it easy! Loved my in store experience.</Text>

My experience was uniquely tailored to my needs and the customer service was beyond stellar. Marquez was professional and created an atmosphere that defined how customer's care can be customized. All steps were executed to create the best outcomes for me. This obviously is a well managed store with a very good trained staff because I witnessed others having similar experiences..< /Review>

Marquez was AMAZING! Very informative and patient with me while I shopped for a new phone with my 5 month old! He helped me find the phone I wanted and accessories that will be so useful for me at work (I'm an ER nurse). All future trips to AT&T will be to the Walnut Creek store. :)</review>

Marquez and his team members did a great job at providing assistance, technical support, and answers while i awaited my new phone set up.

i was in the store for approximately 30 minutes and they greeted everyone with courtesy and appreciation.

Marquez researched my questions and maintained sanitary conditions in the space kudos to him and his co-workers.<//review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><text>I decided to port a phone number from my company account to personal account. I realized it was a very complex process. I went to Walnut Creek ATT Store to look for help. I was so happy that Jordon Morrow from the store was able to hand hold me all the way through the process. He spent over an hour to complete my transaction. He was very patient and kind with me. He helped me every step of the way. It was such a good feeling and experience to be served by someone who really care about his customers.<//text><UserId.>109993015491677830421<//UserId.>< name>

<review>Carl was so patient and thorough in making sure we picked the right phone for my Mom as well as teaching her how to use it.  Go to Carl especially if you are not the most tech savvy person or have retired senior parents looking for the most cost effective plan/device to suite how they use their phones.</review>< Rate>

Customer service here is quick and they can get it done. They have many measures for health and safety in place. Much better than over the phone or online service.</Review>

<Review>The young Lady named Keisha that serviced me at the store in Walnut Creek yesterday around 3 or 4 was beyond wonderful. She was extremely knowledgeable and helpful to me and I think she deserves to be at a higher position as well as a offered a raise . Everything I asked for she knew it and she went above and beyond her job . She's an asset to the brand as well as to her colleagues and staff . I'll be passing out this wonderful experience to my network because of her !</Review><Rate>5<//Rate><gmapID>0x808561c1fecd6a27:0xb3e2219b3aa87d28<//gmapID>< user_id>

<review>Kolubah at the Walnut Creek Provided superb service. He showed us how to transfer all the information, photos, contacts, messages from my Samsung phone to my new iPhone SE, by downloading the app ‘move iOS’ onto my Samsung and my iPhone, then walking through how to do the transfer. He also showed how to use the different features in our new iPhones.
In addition, he showed how to move my old iphone notes into iCloud, so I could transfer them to the new iPhone,  as well a nice tip to use airdrop to move photos instead of moving the photos in the iCloud, then transferring it to the new iPhone.
This was in stark contrast to the gentleman at the Pleasant Hill store who told us to buy technical support and they would help us move the data from the Samsung to the iPhone SE. He was also gruff and brief in his response to questions  in helping to set up our new iPhones. We wished we didn’t switch from Verizon to AT&T, until we met Kolubah at the Walnut Creek store
Thank you very much to Kolubah for your superb service. We wish you had staff like him at every store.</review>< Name>

<text>I am very happy about the staff at this ATT store in Olympic Blvd in Walnut Creek. I needed to set up my brand new Samsung Galaxy S20+ and Kolubah and Karl went above and beyond to help me understand the features and functions. Kolubah also explained ATT TV to me, and I was able to switch over from my much more expensive TV plan. They really helped me a lot, and most important they did not make me feel as if I'm technologically inept. They were patient, took the time to explain everything to me. Thank you Kolubah, thank you Karl and thank you AT&T!</text>< Pics>

<userid>101093851232403306471<//userid><rate>1</rate><review>COVID-19 have been a big health concern for everyone, cdc authorized ALL stores to take precaution and safety measures. Why when I walk into this AT&T I see no safety measures being followed? This store is not following 6 feet social distancing, there are way too many customers in this store at one time, people are sitting at one table altogether, and workers are supposed to have the plastic/glass board in front of  work stations to protect them and customers from close contact. Why do I not see any of that compared to a lot of other phone stores?? I feel this is not a healthy environment and I will report to CDC if this is not fixed immediately. Management need to take this seriously! Cases have been spiking all across the Bay Area!!!! GET IT FIXED! I will never step another foot in this door again until I feel safety precautions are being followed.</review>< Gmap_id>

< review>
This 5 star is for Robert, the representative who helped us. We came in to upgrade a phone and ended up paying less than expected thanks to Rob. I can only imagine that most companies would encourage their employees to milk every dollar from the customer. Rob did the exact opposite. He went through the math and explained very thoroughly how adding a new line and cancelling it in 24 months would be cheaper than upgrading two phones. He explained this very well, managed to answer all of our questions, and was extremely patient and courteous. I write this because I hope this kind of behavior is encouraged and cultivated. Robert, thank you for being a shining example of this.< /review>

The wait was long with only 2 people ahead of me. Would be nice to get an estimate when they check you in. Otherwise all went well and I got the transaction done.<//Review>

Went to get a new iPhone & found out from Siska that my phone is still under warranty.  Was having problems w/ overheating & cracked screen.

Still will be getting a new phone within a year, for now it saved me quite a ton!

<text>We had a horrible experience at the Lafayette Att store and drove to Walnut Creek to hopefully purchase a new phone. Rachel was amazing and helped us get our new phone, trade the old phone in for a credit towards a case and wireless charger. We told her that we were in a rush because of afternoon plans and she completely understood and got us out of there as fast as possible. We were in and out within an hour with a new phone and multiple accessories to accompany it. It was easy because we knew what we wanted, a S10 galaxy in black, and she got the process for that started while I picked out cases, wireless charger etc. Thank you Att Walnut Creek!!</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

< review>
Highly disappointed with the quality of service, I had received. If '0' stars was an option, that would be my choice. One day prior to leaving on a major road trip, I was sold a faulty iPhone 7, which gave illegal access to anyone and everyone to GPS my location 24/7, putting my safety, security, and privacy both on & offline in jeopardy.

Who trains these employees, aren't they concerned with the quality of customer service they provide, or the lack thereof? Or, aren't they the least bit concerned about the safety, privacy, and security of a customers welfare/well-being? (Doubt it). Or is it merely all. about. the. sale, the money, and the upsell?

Seriously, when I inquired about my device having calls and text messages on it, and it being named, when it was a brand new iPhone, I was given the pathetic explanation that it was because I had signed into my Apple ID. So, I returned to the store later that day and ended up having another employee take a look at it. She (didn't get her name), took my iPhone into the back office for a few minutes and gave me the signed into my Apple ID explanation. I wanted/needed to make sure. So she had me sign out, erase all data and restore the phone to its factory settings.

When I reset the iPhone and signed back into my Apple ID, no phone numbers or text messages popped up, and my phone did not name itself. When I inquired about exchanging it for a brand new iPhone in a box that was still in its shrink wrap, I was told I would be charged a $45 exchange fee, of course, I asked why the fee, when the iPhone was clearly a faulty product and I had just purchased it that morning and was leaving for a 2.5 week road trip and needed to make sure I had a reliable phone. She insisted it wasn't the phone and that there wasn't anything that could be done about the $45 exchange fee, then she wanted to send me to the Apple store. Frustrating. I was literally leaving on a 2.5 week road trip the very next day and didn't have time to be running around fixing an issue that was clearly an error AT&T could have easily fixed, if their customer service was up to Par (which it obviously wasn't). The phone was purchased at their store not at the Apple Store, resolving the problem should have been their responsibility, instead, they tried to pass it off on the Apple Store.

Eventually, I ended up calling the corporate customer service line who also told me, I would need to take it back to the store where the phone was purchased and speak with a manager, but by that time it was outside the return time I was given, which was 14-day, only to be informed by the corporate customer service rep, that the return time is 30 days. It was too late, I guess it was my fault that on my road trip, I didn't think of stopping in and taking time from my vacation (my last big road trip of the summer and my last major trip of grieving & healing from over 10 years of loss and trauma) to stop at a random AT&T store to fix a stupid error that could easily have been solved, before my trip.

However, from that one poor interaction, I refuse to return to the downtown Walnut Creek AT&T store, honestly there is no reason why they didn't / couldn't just waive that exchange fee. Even when I had returned to the store, the guy who checked me in, found it strange that there was already data on a brand new device.

Thanks for the lack of service, AT&T!< /review>

<Text>The worst store evere! While many of the staff are available, they are not paying attention to the customers. Most of the time they provide you some inaccurate information to just sell their products. Definitely you will get surprised with you first bill!! And then good luck to resolve those extra charges!!< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Horrible experience, I was told I would get a $300 credit for my phone as a trade-in, I left to transfer everything to the new phone and returned only to be told Kesha, my salesperson, had made a mistake and I would only be getting $60. I then had to reactivate my old phone and restore everything back on it and re-pair my iWatch. The process took about 3 1/2 hours for nothing.<//Review>

Rachel helped us- or lack there of. She spoke to us in cold, one worded answers, never looking up from her ipad. My mom was trying to understand the differences between the X, Xs, Xr and Rachel literally did the bare minimum of explaining the differences. I had to ask her to repeat what she said as my mom didn't catch it. She rolled her eyes at us and treated us like we were so stupid. I said directly but kindly "my mom isn't sure what you're explaining and I feel like you're not being too helpful can you just repeat that?" I was met with a disgusted glare, so I asked for the manager.

The manager was EVEN WORSE. I asked the manager to explain to my mom what a dual camera us (neither of us know what that means, sorry if we're technologically behind. I have the X and it doesn't have this feature so how I'm supposed to know what the dual camera means is beyond me). After I asked her to explain what that means she responded with a condescending smirk "if you let me finish my sentence i was going to tell you." During the rest of our stay we were met with short responses, lack of communication, and rudeness.

We've never been treated like that as guests. Their customer service is WAY below average, truly making us feel stupid and lesser than. Unfortunately a few minutes later said manager was talking to another employee about how to restock shelves and I overheard. Her tone was truly disgusting and the employee looked really upset and on the verge of tears.

We never plan to go here again and this place seriously sucks.<//review><name>suki clements< /name>< rating>

<text>It's my worst nightmare experiences with the white girl name Taylor, and she identified herself as a store manager.  She has absolutely no clue how to handle a consumer.  I simply asked her if She escalated to her boss about my issue?  She didn't give me a straight answer.  She threatened to call the police to arrest me and told me to leave the store.  Well, if AT&T keeps hired moron and racist like her, the business in Walnut Creek won't last long.  Be careful with your bill if you have AT&T.  Big time fraud!
Thanks for Taylor's management!  Because of her behavior I cut AT&T before I left the store on same day.  My bill is averaging 400 dollars a month.  I went immediately to T mobile bought 4 S8 and 1 iphone x.  While in T mobile I received 1st class treatment and there were multiple customers also left AT&T to join T mobile.  I wish I was with T-Mobile a long time ago.  Check out T mobile customer service and you will see the big difference.<//text>< pics>

I switched to T Mobile (after being an AT&T customer for 11 years) because of this store. Granted, I was already pretty disgusted by corporate customer service, but the deplorable conduct by Tiffany and the purported “manager”, Rachel, was the proverbial nail in the coffin.
More specifically, Tiffany hung up on me twice (while laughing condescendingly) when I called to ask a poignant question. I then called a third time, asked for the manager, and got this gem, Rachel, who laid into me over the phone and tried to cross-examine me regarding the veracity of my statements like she was on a casting call for an episode of Law and Order. Moreover, Rachel tried to blame me instead of fielding my concerns. Given how absurd it was, it’s kind of comical: these women (Tiffany and Rachel) are completely oblivious to basic common courtesy.
In short: I was getting sick of AT&T to begin with, and this store’s conduct pushed me over the edge to T Mobile. Goodbye, AT&T and good riddance!<//text>

I visited this store only because they have this new phone Sonim XP8 which I can buy online but I thought it will be faster to do in store. They refuse to buy it because I’m not first responder and they told me this only after 15 minutes wait while they checking something and don’t know what to do.
Awful experience.<//Text>

(More reps than customers) I didn't let that bother me as much as being ignored the entire time. I walked around the entire 900ft square store to see if anyone would help me or asked if i needed any help. One by one another customer walks and is greeted or helped. After 10min i just walked out.  When a customer spends his or her money in a store, does the customer have to go out of their way to be noticed? I'll  bever go back to this store.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<text>I just want to make sure that anyone who comes into this store looking to set up a new account knows that the manager here, Millard Zumel, is simply amazing. As is the norm with most people dealing with a bloated company like AT&T, I ran into a variety of issues with corporate who tried to over charge me, cancel my service and a whole host of other things, but Millard Zumel was an absolute champion for me as a customer. Whilst corporate spent it's time blowing my concerns off and making me wait on hold for at least 4 hours, Millard was quick to respond to me and helped me deal with corporate and protected my rights as a customer. Whilst I may hesitate to recommend AT&T as a company, I would say that if you do end up going with them, come to this location and ask for Milard's help. He will take better care of you than any ISP provider ever has.<//text><rating>5</rating>< resp>

<text>Staff at SAN RAFAEL store were great, super friendly but this corporation is lame and really still does not care about its customers. Hard to find a phone contact and just got a brand new phone from Att and the the voice mail doesn't work. I took back the next day and they wanted to change me $35 for THEIR BROKEN phone. What about the inconvenience and the 2 hours I spent trying to get this issue resolved with a new phone???
OR you can send the phone away and in ONE MONTH......they will repair.
Idiots!
GREAT customer service. Thanks for nothing.....< /text>< Rating>

We were immediately greeted and were in and out within 30 minutes. We needed to add an additional line to an existing plan.< /review>

< Review>
manager Clio is the worst and clearly has no idea what good customer service is. Every time i went to this location she managed to surprise me in a bad way. It took them an hour to provide us with a simple sim card! There was no problem with the phone or anything, the people who works there are just  very very slow, don't care about you'r time or if there are other people waiting for service. Will not recomend this location.</Review>

Cataclysmic failure!! Mustafa in the Walnut Creek store was great initially, but really let me down when it came time for renewing my contract.  I tried to set up an appointment with him, he did not respond to my texts/voice mail about renewing the annual contract, as a result ATT shut off my internet and TV accounts.

Unsatisfactory!< /review>

AT&T is THE WORST!! They lie to you  about what services will cost, tell you they have cancelled old services when they don't! I think this company is fraudulent.</review>
