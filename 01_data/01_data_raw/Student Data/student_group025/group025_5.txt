<review>Clean, well kept and friendly environment. The staff go above and beyond to make sure you look your best and are satisfied before you leave. Recommend the MVP it's kind of a no brainer, might as well treat yourself.  Bonus for me  was the staff are great with kids. Got my vote.<//review>< pics>

<user>115788244289979703255<//user><text>I scheduled a haircut for my 5 year old son online and checked in with ease. Upon arrival we were asked to wait outside until our appointment time. When it was our turn, our stylist, Nancy set up a chair in the waiting room area so my son could still see me during his appointment (he is a little shy). All of the employees and customers were wearing face masks and socially distancing.  It was a great experience and we will be back next month for another cut!< /text>< response>

The female Barber 💈 offered me a MVP . She offered me a hot towel and said I had to keep my mask 😷 on. What’s the purpose of asking me do I want the MVP treatment if the only way to get a hot towel treatment on my face I have to keep the mask on . It defeats the purpose of getting a hot towel treatment in the first place not alone a MVP. Spent more money 💰 than I should’ve.< /Text>

Dropped in Christmas week of 2019 and the price for the basic cut was $24. If it’s your first visit to the location, you get upgraded to the VIP service that includes shampoo and massage.

Went on a Saturday afternoon and they had six staff so the wait was short. Had a great cut and barbers were helping each other and pointing out tiny spots that were missed on their other clients . I appreciate that because sometimes I don’t like pointing out fixes.

Will likely come back when I’m in town again.< /Review>

Im a caregiver for a couple in Rancho Palos Verdes, my client been trying to get a hair cut for months but do to the pandemic he hasnt been able too. I called in and I was told I needed to make a appt online, I couldnt get online to make a appt for my 99 year old client and I called back around 9:45am... Thank you so much to Monica who took my call and made a appt for me and accepted my client Paul right away. Thank you Monica appreciated so much. He was very happy with his haircut.</Text>

Like this place, female employees are friendly, quick ,and courteous. Shop is clean and well maintained. Prices are fair and get a lot of return customers. They are fast and efficient in their approach but not pushy and do a good job on all the clients.
A bit cramped in the waiting area but it is not a stand alone  shop.
They are close to a few good food places and will text msg  you through there system when you are close to getting serviced.<//text>

Update Review: 05-12-2018

Had another awesome hair cut today but by ( Nicole ) she did a wonderful job and she was very good. She took her time and made sure that I was happy with the services. And at the end, she ask me if I wanted any Gel, Shampoo and things like that and I told her in fact Yes I looking for a bar of soap by Paul Mitchell, and guess what? They had it so I purchased it for myself.

My overall experience here at this location is just wonderful, Guys come on down and ask for Nicole and Cheryl and get your haircut today by these wonderful women who take pride in there work. There is not too many places like this, most of them is just in and out.

This location all the staff is dong a great job and I believe in training and training that is how people keep there customers and they keep coming back like me. To the owners of this location, you have a great staff, keep up with the great services you guys are the best in San Pedro, CA.

This place has great customer service for sure. Today had my hair by ( Cheryl ) she was awesome, straight to the point, I told her what I wanted and she did a great job. I was very happy with the services at this location and overall performance I give them 10

Store very clean
Great customer service all around
Everything was very clean
Parking not that bad but you can park on the 3rd floor and walk a little
Easy payment on the computer, ( I had a little trouble ) but Cheryl really took her time out to explain to me about the computer, this was the first time for me.

I would be back for sure. Thank you Sport Clips, you have a great employee ( Cheryl ) she's a doll,

<text>I have worked for Great Clips and Supercuts prior to SportClips and so far my experience with SportClips has been delightful. Nicole my manager invited me to the annual event in Anaheim where I met other stylists from other locations. The owner Spencer Chamberlain organized a party for all the stylists with great food, live music and a raffle where everyone received a gift. I can’t believe I won a cordless Wahl clippers to kick off my new job at SportClips! Yay!
Both Nicole and Claudia have been patiently training me, answering all my questions and explaining all the important aspects of The 5 points to a successful career with SportClips. I am thrilled to start and work as a team and bring the numbers up! 👍🏼 Nancy C< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Stumbling across Sports Clips on S. Western was the greatest stumble of my life. Walked in needing a haircut for my wedding, my normal barber closed, and asked for a trim. On the first visit Cheryl gave me the free MVP special. Fantastic haircut. Trimmed my goatee. Got a shampoo in a massage chair. Hot and cold towel on my face followed up by massage wand on my shoulders. Great first visit.

Fast forward a month and a half and I came back. Cheryl gave the same great service and an absolutely amazing haircut. Also, they do free touch ups between haircuts. Last thing. It’s Sport Clips so I got to watch the World Cup! Belgium won!  Thanks Cheryl!!!< /Review>

I went there yesterday for the first time to get my 2 year old a haircut and I was a bit nervous because everytime i take my son to get a haircut anywhere it always comes out uneven. I decided to try SportsClips and a girl names Jessica did his hair and it came out perfect! She was very patient and great with him! I was very happy with how his hair looked. It was very clean and the employees are all very friendly, great atmosphere. Will definitely go back there from now on and I would recommend to others .<//Review>

After the change I left very unhappy and poor attention to detail left me with a really bad haircut. So time to find a new place. Good luck on your visit.< /text>< Response>

He went through step-by-step explaining my before and after of what would be done with the truck, and after the truck was done he then explained and showed me the work and how to use the hard cover. The work done on the truck looked amazing, and would take any other job or recommend anyone else to take their work to Line-X! He also kept his word on the quote that I was given, which was reasonable and well worth it.< /text>< Pictures>

<text>This was our first time using Line-X of Corona and they did not disappoint! Superb customer service. Kalvin is very professional and knowledgeable. He did an excellent job of answering all of our questions; explaining the process and helping us choose what bed-liner option worked best for us. Worth every penny! Will definitely be returning for more work to be done in the near future.</text>< pictures>

Line-X of Corona is under new ownership as of the new year 2021. I didn't know this when I scheduled my appointment...but the new owner did not disappoint. My truck liner came out great and learned a bit about him and how he also owns the Rancho location which shares a space with his other business Empire Motorsports. Thanks for the great service, and being on schedule.<//review>

<review>We outfitted out new Truck with both the back flip cover and the spray on protective coating for the bed of our Ford F150.  The work was completed on time and professionally.  After a minor factory imperfection was discovered weeks later, the owner of the Corona store followed through to replace the problem area to our satisfaction.  He went over and beyond by contacting the factory to explain the issue and request the replacement under warranty.  He took the lead and resolved the issue competently, professionally, and compassionately.  Always a professional attitude.  Can't say enough about the service and the products he sells.</review>< Rate>

The place to go.  Had  a redo on my Line-X to put the gloss on.  It worked well and the crew cleaned up the old Line-X that was eight years old.  Perfect results.  Need your new or old truck bed protected?  Take it to Line-X in Corona.  Best of the best for bed liners.< /Text>

I have used LINE-X of Corona a few times. Never had any problems with the product.  I'm a metal stud framing contractor and I'm amazed how well the products holds up.
Service is great and the price is right.
Thank you LINE-X-Corona.  Love the product.

The only local Line-X dealer. My old truck had a Line-X liner that was still in good shape after 10 years of light use.  Had the standard coating application applied to my new truck's bed. They had the truck for a few hours. It was ready when promised. They removed and replaced the upper tie downs. No overspray. Overall a very professional job at a fair price.</Review>

Awesome. my new bed liner is just totally awesome. Kalvin is a true professional and he just ordered my new bed cover which they will install at no charge. Highly recommend a Line X bed liner and getting it from Line X of Corona by Kalvin and his crew. Thank You for my New Totally Awesome Truck Bed.<//review>

Couldn't have been happier.  The mgr, maybe the owner, a young guy was knowledgeable about the product .  Gave me a tour of the facility and explained the process of how it is applied.< /Text>

<review>I have had two trucks  over the past 4 years that this Line-X location has installed a Line-X bed liner and most recently, a Bak-Flip bed cover.  This shop is professional, polite and they go out of their way to make you feel special.  I will return here over and over again and will tell everonevaboit how great they are. If you want great customer service with a quality product, than this is the right shop for you.</review></record>

This place is really neat, I swing by here every couple of mornings a week. Their breakfast sandwiches are tasty, they make freshly squeezed orange juice, and their donuts are good too.
I often go for the deal they have there where if you buy a sandwich and drink, you get a free random donut, and who doesn't like that?
If you're in the area, I suggest visiting this donut shop. 😁<//text>

My wife, myself and 7 year old did this and it was a blast!  It was challenging without being ridiculous.  Some puzzles were pretty easy and some were quite hard.  It required a lot of thinking logically and outside the box a little bit.  My only complaint is that I can only experience each escape room for the first time once.

Also, the staff were great and very helpful.  This was my first escape room and I know I am going to do more because of this experience.  I can't recommend this place enough!</Text>

Tons of fun. Just bring your A game. You'll need it. We have done rooms all over and don't get stumped often. This one got us though.<//Text>

<review>The staff was very friendly and helpful.   The room wasn't very big.  I do not recommend large groups for this place.  There was a big issue that I had with this escape room. The timer beeped every second and I left with a migraine.  There should be a warning about the beeping.</review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x808f9436b4dfccf9:0xf19e0fcea5011117<//gmapID></record>

Very mediocre and dirty. Person actually comes in the room to give clues. No backstory. Has potential under the right people. And gotta fix the small details< /Text>

<username>Garrison Swartz< /username><Review>This was the 5th escape room I’ve been to and was definitely the least professional.  There was no video for a pre story to the room. The “host” in the beginning simply tried to tell the story but he didn’t seem to know what to say.  The place it’s self was very plain and he random stuff just taped to the walls. When you go to the room, you pass an area separated by a large curtain. There was a large group of people talking very loudly. When we were in the room, the group of people could be heard the whole time.

When we got into the room, it was kind of disappointing.  The room was really small for our 5 person group and it had clearly been well used and not maintained. When you want clues at the other rooms I’ve been to, you ask them via a walk-in talkie or button on the wall and the instantly contact you over the walk-in talkie or a speaker. This room has a button on the door that they apparently just ignore. When we needed a clue, we pushed the button over 5 times in a 10minute period to get a clue. When we were finally acknowledged, the guy came into the room, looked around to see where we were and then gave us a clue and left.  The other time we needed a clue, it was another 10minute wait with pushing the button several times.

The good part was that the clues were challenging yet fun to figure out. We did the Hunting Lodge. Probably won’t come back to this place again. The two places we’ve been to in Livermore and Dublin were better experiences.< /Review></record>

Best role playing game I’ve ever played! As a player, you not only need to figure out who is the murder, but also need to figure out the stories behind each character. Also need to put yourself into the position of character and thought about who you need to protect in such situation...good script and good staff!<//text>

<text>Took my wife here for her 24th birthday. We did the lost kingdom which was really fun time.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  We were grouped with another couple and it was an overall good time.  I see negative reviews but the staff spoke good English, the puzzle master was a nice guy.  I think they were upset they Didn’t make the time.  It’s all a game just have fun and be open minded. Me and my wife plan on coming back again for the other rooms.< /text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<review>Had a blast here! Brought the whole family for treasures of the Empire detective mode.  Plenty of challenging puzzles and props but not impossibly difficult. The people running the place were awesome and made sure we had a great experience. One tip without giving anything away: Make sure you listen to what they tell you before you start. Some rooms have multiple play modes and they will let you know what puzzles you need to ignore, which we forgot while we were playing. Good luck escaping!</review>< pics>

Fun escape room but it's probably smaller than you're expecting it to be and less impressive. Most escape rooms are. The best escape rooms are more expensive and in places like San Francisco. However, if this one is hard for you, you won't fare much better at one of those.<//text>

<Review>This is not a well planned out escape room. 1. The staff is not clear about the instructions.  2.  A lot of the “puzzles” didn’t work. Causing us to lose time 3. The puzzles were more like, figure out what we were thinking instead of actual puzzles.

I’ve been to a lot of escape rooms and this is definitely poor quality! Go somewhere else!

Also, I feel like a lot of the reviews here were done by the staff!! (BEWARE! And stay away!!)<//Review>< name>

Very hot in the rooms. They locked our belongings in a locker that we didn’t have access to. A puzzle broke and threw off our group. The game master was very rude and barely spoke English. The good reviews on this are definitely made by the staff. Don’t come to this escape room!!! There are plenty other escape rooms in this area with nice people that run the business.</Review>

This was my third experience with an escape room and we chose the Hunter's Lodge since it was the lowest level of difficulty. We couldn't escape even the first room with the clues they provide (which took way longer to decode than they should have). I cannot imagine attempting the other rooms they have. Good luck!< /text>

(Would recommend 6 max) The puzzles were the appropriate difficultly as advertised and overall a fun challenge for beginners. My main complaint is that the people who run this place were having a family dinner (i'm assuming) at the same time as our booking. We could hear a lot of yelling and laughter which completely ruined the mood. Also, we were stuck on 1 problem for nearly 20 mins due to poor construction and lighting. We had 1 hint that we used up for this puzzle. When we asked for clarification a second time, the attendant would not explain the same hint. Personally, I would not go back again.<//Review>< pics>

A very poorly run escape room! The employee did not fully reset the room from the last grp resulting in a waste of 30 mins! Also, it was extremely hot and stuffy in the rooms, as there was no AC or airflow! The escape room itself was probably 2/5, was just mainly puzzles, less about finding things.< /Review>

<Text>Broken, disjointed puzzles, terrible organization and a choppy story line.  Here's a spoiler: One of the locks is a five letter combo but only uses four letters: BONE.  This escape room is really an escape money trap for your wallet.<//Text>< Pics>

Tedious and repetitive puzzels, multiple times where they had to enter the room in order to fix broken puzzles and lack of immersion all contribute to a not enjoyable experience that I would not recommend.< /Text>

< review>
I had quite a terrifying emergency with my brakes going out while driving, and was expecting a huge bill as I did some research with other mechanics. Not only did they check in with me right away, they were all very friendly. On top of it, my final bill was quite a bit lower than I was expecting! In these days of Covid, even a small amount saved is a lot and I am very appreciative of the positive experience I had there. Thank you Jeff and crew!<//review>

<Review>The best crew they've had in years! Ericka and Jeff in the office are awesome to work with, friendly and efficient! The guys out in the shop are absolute professionals who have been in the game long enough to want to strive to make sure any repairs or maintenance they perform are perfect. Friendly small town feel for sure at this store👍🏻👍🏻<//Review>< Pics>

I had purchased my tires several years ago in Modesto. When one tire developed a slow leak,  this was the closest store.  I arrived at lunch time and still had my tire fixed and was back on the road in 30 minutes.  Great,  friendly service!<//Text>

I don't usually do this but this time I had to.
The first time I went to this place, was to change the tires of my car. I called to make the appointment  asked for prices, chose the tires and all that. When I went to to appointment, I asked about the tires, to be sure the brand was correct. The tires were a different brand, but since the price was similar and the brand was a good one, I said "Well, its fine." I thought it was a misunderstanding. But, Maybe I should have learned from the first time.
The second time, I went for my car's maintenance. Oil chance and everything. Also, they were going to do a "diagnostic". So, the car needed some fixing, where I spent A LOT of money. I was told it had a warranty for 1 year. Some months later, there was a problem around where the car was fixed. I called and said what was wrong, they gave me an appointment for 3 days later. When I went to the appointment, I left the car there. Soon, they called me back and told me that the problem was something else and had to take it somewhere else to be fix, because they couldn't fix what they said was wrong. Well, It was't what they told me it was. On my way to the other mechanic, it got worse, good thing I didn't take the freeway. I called to tell them the problem and they insisted it was what they said, which wasn't. They invented every excuse they could. ( I don't doubt that they didn't even check to see what was wrong. When I took the car there,  it was in the same place I left it, and when I went back for the car and insisted what I was sure was wrong, they didn't even look just started the car and said what was wrong) I supposed when they did the "diagnostic" of the car, they were supposed to help fine the problems it had and try to fix it. That's what I trusted them to do and that's why I took my car for inspection,  not to have it going off in the middle of the road months (not even 3 months)  later from taking it  there. Even if the problem wasn't what they fixed and was something else, they could  have take the time to really take a look and if it was something else, I, of course, would had paid for it.
If you can't cover the warranty of your products and services at least have the decency to say so or even take the time to see what exactly is wrong. Don't make people waste their time and money.<//text>

Had a rear wheel cylinder start to go out on the road from Healdsburg to Calistoga last night then totally blew out on the return trip this morning through Alexander Valley. The first shop I saw along Healdsburg Ave. was Big O Tires. I pulled in and to make a long story short, they squeezed me in and had my 2002 Dodge Grand Caravan, with 227,712 miles on it, ready to pick up by 1:00 this afternoon. They told me the manager was the one that worked overtime on it. A big shout out to the team at the Healdsburg Big O Tires. They saved my day and possibly my life if I had gone on down the highway to another town for same day service.
You guys and gals are the BEST!
Thanks
A new loyal customer!

I've been going to Big O in Healdsburg for over 25 years. They have always treated me very well.

Recently, I had some work done there that didn't go as planned. Work was performed on my car that resulted in a less than satisfactory outcome. Rick and his team acknowledged immediately that there were some errors on their end. No hassling, no blame game stuff. They took responsibility. Rick called me himself, explained the situation, and let me know how they were going to make it right. We came to a deal that I was very satisfied with. 2 days later, my car was back on the road, performing as it should, if not a little better.

The mark of a good business is not just getting the job done right. That is expected when you pay for services. The true mark of a good business is how they handle things when the job doesn't go right. Rick handled this situation as best as I could have hoped for. I highly recommend Big O in Healdsburg.< /Review>< username>

<rating>5</rating><review>Saved me $250 on parts and a bit on labor over local Toyota Dealer estimate for hub/bearing assembly replacement on my Tacoma.  They got the wrong part, but, were able to get me out in about the same time as originally estimated. And, the tech was thorough enough to recommend rotation at no additional charge, after final roadtest, which I appreciated.   I would go back for this type of work.  Beware of dealer service estimates.  Get the full labor and parts breakdown, and do a little research.  It can save you hundreds.< /review>< pictures>

Went in because my tire tread was under 3/32 and they were still covered under the warranty but Rick did not want to help me with that. He was offering me $25 off each tire which seemed low to me and when I called Nitto (the tire brand) customer service they said there was a proper way to calculate my discount but Rick refused to use the formula. I went to America’s Tire and they gave me $67 off each tire. Don’t let Big O scam you. Do your research to make sure you get the maximum discount.</review>

I have been in twice for flat repairs since I bought my new car 3 years ago.  Both times the staff there have been entirely friendly and helpful.  I'm not sure if there has been an ownership change or new staff, but I had been in years before and I can feel the difference when walking through the door (that's not to say it was bad before, just that it is so nice now!).  Going to the tire shop can be expensive and painful, but it is a little bit easier knowing you are leaving your vehicle with a team that wants to help.  Thank you, Big O, and I won't forget: random acts of kindness. :)<//text>

I bought a set of Michelin tires here for my BMW and Big O was the best price for high speed tires----I looked on line, I checked Costco, America's Tires, independent shops------EVERYWHERE!      AND Big O in Healdsburg gave me the best price.  You might that's pretty good, but it get's better---because their service and expertise cannot be matched, anywhere.      I know this because they have sold me tires and worked on all my cars, so why am I checking prices at all these other places?      Good question, I guess I'm either an annal nerd or I have Obsessive Compulsive disorder.    I think I'm gonna give myself a mental health day and go to the damn gym next time instead of checking prices.    It's like they are willing to make my day great so from now on, they can just do it without me interfering -----"Resistance is Futile, my car business will be assimilated"</text>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>My elderly mom and I were out for a drive and had a tire blowout. Because of the type of vehicle and nature of the blowout, the car had to be towed. We ended up at Big O on Healdsburg Ave (cross street is Monte Vista). They took the car immediately and patched the hole. It took a little over an hour as they were quite busy. Various staff went by to get coffee and use the facilities and everyone of them smiled and said hello and most chatted for a few seconds. When the car was ready, Rick, the manager, came and told us we were good to go. All it cost was a handshake and a smile. Wow, we were not expecting that at all.
If you need Auto Service, I would seriously consider a place with such excellent service, kindness, and a place where all the staff seemed happy to be working there.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

I have bought tires here for the last 8 years, it used to be a place that i knew i could trust, fair prices. good work, and honest. Not anymore. Place is gone totally other direction. Now i can't get the price i get quoted (told me they must have lost it don't know who i talked to) and tried to get me to have work done and pay very high prices for things that were not even needed and certainly nothing I asked for. They also did crappy work that i had to have re worked, ( they wouldn't even return my calls when i confronted them about it.) ill never patronize again.</text>

Unfortunately I haven't had the best experience here. Time and time again I've tried to swallow my concerns and return to support this local spot as the people there are incredibly nice, but the work has been shotty and my family has had the same issues - incomplete jobs, having to return less than a day later for work that should have been taken care of or communicated during payment. Frustrating. Will probably give Big O one more shot...</review>

only place to get a LYFT inspection done so had to go. after 30 min I was told I needed to buy new 900$ tires or my inspection would not pass blackmailing me to pay or be denied working for LYFT. meanwhile 2 weeks prior my UBER inspection was perfect. this is a very bad place and being a local will let the area know. as well as the BBB.< /Review>

<text>This place is amazing, between the exceptional service and the fact that it's locally owned I will never take my car anywhere else. Every time I come in, they are prompt and friendly and always do exactly what they say they're going to do, in the time that they say they will do it, and for reasonable prices.<//text>< pictures>

I've used Big O alot since moving to Healdsburg a few years ago. Having a well maintained and operational vehicle is imperative to me because I drive professionally for Uber during the summer. I also pride myself on being able to do minor repairs and oil changes. When I  have been stumped or don't have the tools to do a job, however, Big O has consistently teamed with me to find the solution and get the job done. Everything from replacing an alternator to rack and pinion steering assembly they have handled with care and precision. They can get busy at times which makes it take longer to get a vehicle back but Rick and the folks there communicate with you to keep you updated as to when you can expect your service to be completed. Thank you Mark and all of you at Big O for helping keep me on the road so people can get where they need to go!<//text>

< Review>
Poor service on weekends. Saturday morning and couldn't balance a single tire for me until Monday. Lost a wheel weight. None of the weights they put on fit well. Also, I should have not bought their cheap china tires. Prices have been getting outragous though.  I guess they think you're trapped to Healdsburg. Check your local Walmart for better service, sad. They just lost a 20 year customer and 4+ cars.<//Review>

great food and exceptionally polite and quick service. The variety of broth is wonderful and our favorites were the tom yum (hot & spicy) and the beef bone soup. Plenty of veggies for each order. Elegant ambience and lots of meter parking.<//review>

Great place for first timers! Had no idea what I was doing but the staff was super helpful and kind. Explained everything from the sauces to the times for cooking, and made us feel so welcomed. Will definitely come back. Great for date nights. Cocktails are as tasty as they are beautiful!< /review>

Outstanding service, thank you Will! Fantastic food coupled with the owner himself "LAMPSON" who just got certified by a Wagu Japanese Company, introducing himself to us, and let me say my wife and I just loved the atmosphere as well. Highly recommend this place. 😀</review>

<Text>I always get sukiyaki and their largest portion of beef. Never let down.

Their customer service is amazing here! No matter how busy they get, they always check up on you and it's great!

I appreciate the outdoor seating and spaced indoor seating (when it's allowed) - it makes things feel a little more normal during these crazy times.</Text><user_id>107258781578592327067<//user_id></record>

Loved It!!! We Came for Our First Time and Glad we Did!! The Staff was Amazing and Thorough with Explaining how everything works. We Enjoyed Appetizers and then had the SukiYaki and Spicy Miso. Amazing!!! The Owner even Came by to Say hello and Introduce Himself, he asked if he could help and Demonstrate. I Love to See Owners Hands on and even Helping to Run food!! Very Very Refreshing to See. The Environment was the Topper with Outside Seating, Heat Lamps and Lights. We will be Back. Mmmmm mmmmm. :)
Thank you All!< /Review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><text>Kaizen is actually my friend's and mine favorite shabu place to go to and we usually eat here once every month. The food and drinks here are solid. They have a variety of meats to choose from, and a few different broths as well. My favorite is the tonkotsu. Very creamy and flavorful broth! Be sure to pair your meals with a hot sakee.<//text><GmapID>0x80dcd9088f839f95:0xe682fcd74a58141c< /GmapID><Date>1610664352511< /Date>< UserId.>

<rate>5</rate><text>I got the angus beef 7 oz which was the perfect portion size for me. I mixed the tonkotsu with spicy miso soup base and it was sooo delicious! The meat was pretty fresh and didn't look frozen. They also have hot drops which is always a plus for me. I liked their ponzu sauce a lot, but thought the goma sauce was just okay.<//text><username>kiron polard< /username></record>

<Text>Servers were nice and they have plenty of space. That’s all I can say positive.

The service itself was super slow. Had to ask for water and napkins three times before we got it. Hot sake was room temperature. Meat quality was decent but soup bases weren’t very good. Beef bone broth tasted like pho and spicy miso was slightly sour.

I would prefer to try out the other different Shabu places than come back again<//Text><user_name>Wilson Tsang</user_name><gmapID>0x80dcd9088f839f95:0xe682fcd74a58141c<//gmapID><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUtSsi-d2yCCgQ8NINsHm77t_7lxBZNv4YtkfL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><UserId.>100618295330470233704< /UserId.><date>1603130442477</date></record>

They're incredibly helpful and take their time to explain their menu. There was never a time where I had to flag them down as they were so attentive.  Quality meat and big portions, even though it is not ayce. Who needs to eat so much meat anyways? LOL besides, quality over quantity any day.</Text>

Honestly I rather go here than any $$$$ Restaurants. The food here is amazing, especially after you come home from snowboarding. Sun or rain it's always a good spot just to kick it and eat.</text>

Absolutely amazing restaurant. The owner came out and showed us how to do everything, they provided complimentary sake upon arrival. The food was absolutely phenomenal, and the service was above excellent. if you are ever in the Tustin Orange county area this is an absolute must and a wonderful hidden gem!< /review>

Warm atmosphere, tasty food, upbeat music, all in all - a great place to eat.

We were greeted by the owner Liam, who introduced himself and even shook everyone in my party's hand. He too the time explain the Shabu Shabu process and offered suggestions. The dinner was amazing.
We'll definitely go back again. 🍲<//text>

12/12/2020-arrived around 3pm and it was closed when Yelp said it was open. So sad. Suppose I should've called in advance instead of trust Yelp. Looked like a great shabu spot</Text>

I work in the area and I've been here for lunch several times. I cannot even begin to say how happy I am that there is a great Shabu place I can walk to.  My usual is a medium shrimp order with the spicy miso. The broth is sooo good. I've also ordered the Tom yum and curry broths. These taste more like traditional Thai Tom yum soup with all the herbs and lemon grass that make a good Tom yum soup. It has a spicy kick so if you're not into spicy food, skip it. Recently also had the sukiyaki broths but it was too rich and sweet for my taste. The curry base broth is probably my new favorite. It's has the spicy and sweetness of coconut milk.  I love this place and I'm so happy they are open during Covid and following the CDC guidelines.</review>

This was such an amazing shabu experience. Firstly the ambiance was great with good seating, great music, very clean. Second the quality of food was amazing. The garlic edamame was the best appetizer we got out of the gyoza, karaage, and edamame, though the wasabi and spicy sauce that come with the karaage take it to a whole other level.

The main course soups were fantastic. Between us we had the spicy miso, shabu, coconut curry, and tonkotsu broth, all fantastic. The owner himself, Lamson, checked in with us, helped customize our sauces and gave us pointers onto how to elevate our experience even more.  Definitely a new regular for us!</text>

Server was really rude. We were a group of 6 but became a 4. The owner was really great with us but the server was super rude. Kept rolling his eyes. I would love to go back but that server made my family feel like they were annoying.have I’ll go back but not if he’s working there. It made the meal dull.<//text>

<text>I came here to eat lunch with my friends while im down here for training. I wanted shabu so I was looking for places between us so we can eat. No regrets at all. the spicy miso broth combo was SOOOO good. SOO filling too. Soup wasnt watered down as most soup places are. Plenty of flavor with every bite. the veggies are SUPER fresh. I cant explain just how good it was.. Come hungry.  youll thank yourself for doing that. Definitely a great place to enjoy shabu. coming from a Japanese man..

Right next to the famous Yost theater in downtown Santa Ana, the food and service was incredible even though it was a busy Friday night. If you're looking for a hot pot style of dinner, good sake, and overwhelmingly nice staff, this is the spot.

We had reservations for 16 of us and they sat someone in the area that was reserved for us all to sit together. This is a smaller venue so that we would’ve had to eat at separate tables otherwise. So we ended up eating at the 4th street marketplace just a block away and it was delicious.<//Text>

This place could be so much more if the location was right. Currently this place resides in a part of Downtown Santa Ana redevelopment zone. Very hipster but foot track is non-existent. If this place were in Irvine, Tustin or Costa Mesa it would be booming.

The cuts off meats are amazing as are the vegetable side dishes. The sauces are hugely subjective as I'm more inclined to like the ponzu and gomme sauce from California Shabu Shabu. So you'll have to decide.

I love the atmosphere and decor of the place, very modern with a touch of old Japanese.

Give this place a try I don't think you'll be disappointed.

Edit 9/28/19: we went there today and found that it's under new ownership. But rest assured everything remains the same, good eats with a pleasant atmosphere.<//Text>

<Text>This Japanese style hot pot restaurants is our favorite in OC. Great service, cozy interior, delicious food. The staff is super friendly. The recently revamped menu offers choices of broth, meat types and sides. Beef, kurobuta pork and pork belly slices are tender, buttery and the best all around. Hot pots are placed in front of guests on a communal counter. Ingredients are first dipped in the boiling broth, then in dipping sauce. Vegetables and noodles are also cooked table side. Flavors range from hearty miso to spicy tom yum. Love the sake here! A great dining experience overall.<//Text>< gmap_id>

Amazing!! This was my first time here and we immediately felt at home. The staff made sure we were sat quickly and offered us advice for the menu. The owner was there too and welcomed us. I also wanted to include how I overheard staff taking care of other customers and it went above and beyond. Seeing staff in a good mood and also seeing the other customers having a good time really set the tone of the place!

For the broth I had the sukiyaki and the 5oz pork belly. The broth was sweeter and stronger than I've had at other shabu but this also meant that the everything was very flavorful after cooking. Often I would have to rely on dipping my food for flavor at other shabu but found this time I could enjoy it straight from the pot! The sauces were also amazing so I could not resist using it a few times. My friend had the shabu shabu broth and couldn't stop praising it during the meal. I can't wait to visit again! 🙌< /review>

The staff was very attentive and nice. The friend that accompanied me never had shabu shabu before, so they gave her the whole run down on how it works and helped prep her sauces with all the add-ons that came along with the meal. I noticed them doing that with a few of the other guests in the restaurant as well. It's pretty cool that they take the time the educate people here because a lot of other places will leave you struggling to figure things out the first time.</Review>

It's refreshing to see a restaurant have so much fine while balancing some bomb flavors. I grew up with hot pot and can be quite picky, but I can really dig what they have done.

I went here with my date and we each got our own shabu pot, she got the spicy miso and I got the tonkotsu. Both were solid. The quality and variety of meat available were both superb and the vegetables/sides that come with the meal are standard for shabu.

The owner stopped by and introduced himself to us and offered a free round of sake on the house which we gladly accepted. Service was friendly and they were quick to bring out our food and drinks.

Overall, the location is nice and priced about average for the kinda of meat you get. Highly recommended if you're in the area and looking for shabu shabu.< /review>

Very nice place to bring a date.  The ambience is very pretty.

The service is great.

The food is alright.  It's recommended to get a combo but in hindsight I would just order one meat. It's enough for a good meal.

Pork is good.  Beef is good.  Salmon... I'd pass.  After cooking it, it tasted like chicken.<//text>

<review>Really yummy meat and the service is awesome. Came here when it was the old business chain and Jenny helped us, she helped us again tonight. She is always willing to help demonstrate a new sauce or answer any questions. Also the manager greeted us which we appreciated because hey... who doesn’t like to be acknowledged?<//review><Resp>None<//Resp>< user_id>

Instead of sitting in traffic on the 5 freeway,  we decided to stop by downtown Santa Ana for an early dinner.   My husband and I love shabu and tried pretty much every location in Orange County,  so why not try this new location.  I believe it's only beem opened for a couple of months.   Its tucked right next to Yost theater.   Decor is gorgeous with a modern twist.   They have a full bar!!

We wanted to try the basic meat with their shabu shabu basic broth.  So we ordered the large (sumo)  size yojie beef and their large (samurai)  Swai fish (because I've never had swai fish with shabu before.   They have a combo plate that's great for sharing (they do have a reasonable solit entree fee).

The meat was good, I'm glad it didn't come out with frozen slices (always wait for meat to thaw before cooking).  The yojie beef wasn't too fatty.   Swai fish was soft and tender (dont over cook in broth).   Veggies and udon  was basic like any other place.   We opted for brown rice which was I understand can be hard in texture,  but it was a really hard to swallow so i asked for a bowl of white rice,  which was also under cook and a but hard.   Work on the rice texture please!!

Sauces=ponzu it was alright,  a little too much soy sauce for me,  I like it more tangy with a bit more citrus.   Goma  was good, no complaints there.   They also have a third sauce Swisher which is sweet and savory which they let us try for free.   It was too sweet for me.   Each platter comes with only 2 sauces.   Ask to try them before committing.

Service was great we were constantly checked on they made sure we  knew what we were doing.   Overall good food and great experience.</text>

I just went here the other day on a date with my wife and had a great time. The atmosphere was nice, boasting modern furnishings and almost club like music. The real highlight though was the food! The menu isn't overly complicated and everything we tried was fantastic. The meat was cut perfectly into thin slices, unlike some other Shabu Shabu restaurants I've frequented, and paired well with the sauces they provided. One thing I will note is that we were never asked if we knew how Shabu Shabu style dinning works, which could be a bummer if your new to the dining style. That being said, maybe the staff was just too busy being SUPER NICE AND AWESOME 😊 Seriously, everyone including the manager himself were incredible the whole time we were there, even going so far as to give us some sake on the house since it was our first time. I will definitely be coming back here again soon!<//Text>

<Text>I think I found my new favorite shabu place. It was so good that I wish I was still eating it right now.

Came here with my sister and bf and made it for happy hour. Loved that they have it until 7 as I usually miss it cause I don't get home til almost 6. We ordered the crispy tofu, pickled veggies and pickled cucumbers. All of the appetizers were really good, I loved that that tofu was really soft and the outside was nice and crispy, and the dipping sauce that it came with was so good too. For the pickled veggies, it reminded me of veggies I would have with my broken rice plate, but it was good and it had a nice pickle to it. The cucumbers here were really good, I like the peanut sauce that was with it, and probably the best I've had before.

For my entree I ordered the Tonkotsu broth with the 5oz prime ribeye meat with double goma sauce. The tonkotsu broth was the best I've had so far and I liked that it wasn't too salty compared to other places or wasn't watered down. The meat was fresh and they give you a good cut of it where it isn't too thin. The goma sauce was spot on delicious. Also I got an add on of the black garlic to add to my soup and its a game charger. It makes the broth taste really good like I don't need how to describe it lol but definitely its a great add on for you broth. Veggies were fresh here and love that they give you the clear and udon noodles and that for your broth they don't charge you extra compared to other places. Also, get the wagyu here, it was like butter and you get a good piece of it too where it's not too thin.

Customer service here is top notch, Cathy and Amanda were great! They were very attentive, and were always checking up on us, making sure we had everything and making sure we were good throughout our meal. Also the owner Lamson, he was great too.

Thanks Kaizen for such a great meal!< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

A bit expensive but worth it for the experience. Would not order the green tea again (organic, but $4), but the food itself was high quality. The vegetables were delicious and can be cooked to personal preference. Would recommend cooking things two ahead of what you want them and not all in at once for texture purposes, otherwise you end up with mush. The tonkotsu broth was very flavorful after cooking everything, and a joy to finish off.

Allow for at least an hour and a quarter, preferably longer, to eat and enjoy.</text>

My favorite shabu place in oc. Good quality veggie plate and nice selection of meat. Doesn't have beef belly though, for those that likes beer belly. Owner is very friendly and will try to connect to the customers. The menu is simple and easy to understand compare to mokkoji.<//review>

Best shabu shabu in OC! The beef was so incredibly buttery, tender, and flavorful. The food quality here is top notch, sauces were on point and the veggies that came with it were fresh too. The staff was very attentive and nice. The friend that accompanied me never had shabu shabu before, so they gave her the whole run down on how it works and helped prep her sauces with all the add-ons that came along with the meal. I noticed them doing that with a few of the other guests in the restaurant as well. It's pretty cool that they take the time the educate people here because a lot of other places will leave you struggling to figure things out the first time. It was a great dining experience and we both had a great time. We'll be back for sure!< /text>

We are regular shabu customers and since we were at the CHOC hospital we were craving shabu shabu. We found this place and we were very skeptical at first before walking in.  We were seated right away and greeted by the owner Lamson. As first timers,  he offered us free hot sake, but since hubbs andi don't drink we declined. Customer service: very down to earth, welcoming and personable. Food: one of the best we've had. The Angus beef was good, very big portions.  I didn't finish all the meat but hubbs finished his and mine. We tried the calamari with garlic cilantro sauce and I have to say it was awesome and very delicious. Sorry no pictures we dived in right away. Cost: average and not too pricey.< /text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>There are a lot of good shabu places in the OC, and my previous favorite spot was Mokkoji......until I tried Kaizen.

I'll be honest and say that the service here IS a bit slower, and I think that is a management issue, but the food here makes up for that. The layout of the restaurant is also kinda weird. There is no "traditional" table seating, as it is only bar seating.

The owner, Lamson, is very inviting and super friendly. And he knows shabu. We ordered the tonkotsu and the tom yum, and Lamson recommended that we added the black garlic oil. That enhanced the soup's flavor greatly. Great recommendation. Even without it, the soup itself was very flavorful. So flavorful that once you cooked the meat in it, you didn't really need any sauce because the soup literally soaked the flavor into the meat. Not a lot of other shabu places have soups this flavorful.

The pot style is also really cool - it's like a metal/clay-looking pot with a traditional handle to carry it. Nice touch. I ordered the angus beef and the quality is just very high. You can tell that the quality of the food here is very high.

After we finished the dinner, we had room for the green tea white chocolate fondue. This is highly recommended. The Melting Pot doesn't offer green tea white chocolate, and Kaizen does it as well as they do.

Lastly, this place closes at 12am on Fridays and Saturdays, while most shabu places are closed by 9 or 10pm on those days. So, you can get shabu late if you're in the area. Highly recommended as the quality of the soup and meats are just above the rest.< /text>< user_name>

Wow, wonderful shabu shabu, one of my top favorites. I love veggies and thinly sliced meats. The sukiyaki broth was flavorful and mildly sweet. Spent a little over an hour here enjoying our meals. Hubby got the Yojie special and I got the pork. We put both meats in between us and shared both. Great date night experience and wonderful ambience.</Text>

Lampson, the Owner, greeted us immediately after we sat down.  He was very nice and his restaurant was beautiful.  He obviously pays attention to details.  The ambiance was perfect, from the lighting to the music.  The food was incredible.  You could tell they use high quality ingredients.  I ordered the 10oz of Angus beef and it was sliced at the perfect thickness to cook quickly and not fall apart.  My tonkotsu broth was flavorful and they gave me a large bowl of varied vegetables and noodles.

I highly recommend this shabu shabu restaurant over others as the quality was amazing.< /text>

Great experience here! Food is high quality, the service is prompt and the servers are nice and attentive. If you've  never had shabu shabu before it can be a bit intimidating, but the servers take the the time to teach you how to do it.

It's a great place to either have a full meal or to just grab a drink at the bar. Highly recommended! :)< /Text>

Other oddities include a yogurt green dip for the karage. Definitely don't come expecting a traditional Japanese shabu shabu taste. That said fair overall for the food - nothing outstanding, nothing icky. Stick with the angus or higher grades of beef, which are good. Sides of vegetables, tofu, noodles are like other shabu shabu spots - decent. Rice is subpar - harder than it ought to be even after sitting in some broth. Some meat dips are tasty, some are boring. AC made the inside a touch too cold. Pot temperature was a touch too low got faster boiling, so time was spent just waiting for the food to cook. Karage better at Ikkousha ramen, Little Sheep flavors and selection are better, and price of $80 for Kobe+ Combo+karage is just silly vs most other shabu shabu spots for the amount of food (especially beef). Could easily do Tsuruhashi for $80 for two with far tastier bbq beef, too. Come to chat, watch the game, get some drinks while you eat Americanized shabu shabu, but if you're looking for delicious, other choices abound.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Been here twice within a two week period.  Owner Lamson will do his best to give great service.  Pretty good shabu options.  I tried the beef stir fry and it's very very deeeleecious!  Good parking and very close to the restaurant. I hope Lamson will continue to provide the excellent service and excellent food.  I understand Lamson bought the place from the previous owner so there's that recent change in ownership and management here.

I like to support young entrepreneurs and wish them the very best.  Remember this review the next time you are looking for a shabu shabu restaurant. Lamson will not disappoint.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>The wife and I decided we wanted to get some Shabu and wanted to venture into something other than our usual. So we found this place. Wow, am I glad that we did.

This place is tucked in between the Yost and El Mercado Modern Cuisine close to the foodie lovers 4th street market in Downtown Santa Ana. There is PAID private lot parking, right in front of the restaurant. Otherwise there is also FREE street parking surrounding the area.

The ambiance and decor inside is very modern and clean with plenty of bar seating (I suggest sitting in front of the bar). There is a full bar stocked with Japanese Whiskey( YES!), American Whiskey and other liquors. And of course, BEER and SAKE IS SERVED!

I ordered a Japanese old fashion Hibiki Japanese Whiskey and it was taaaaaasty! My wife also decided to get some Sake (Nigori and got two on the house Hot sake's) with some beer! Needless to say, we were feeling pretty good. As for the food, I ordered the Spicy Miso broth with Samurai Sized Angus beef and my my wife decided on Sukiyaki with the Swaifish (white fish). Both orders were superb tasting and plentiful. I was definitely stuffed post meal.

One thing I'd really like to say about this place is the service is ON POINT! Even the owner/general manager was working and introduced himself to us. Please, YOJIE JAPANESE FONDUE SANTA ANA, don't change your service as you become more popular!<//review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

I didn’t expect to get back much but I was surprised when she gave me my amount! Great experience! Even another staff member there who was not assisting me was kind enough to get me a drink!

We are a 3 year client and we are very happy with the services of Ms Diana Navarette. We received a letter from IRS and without second thoughts she took care of it with no additional charge. Thank you Liberty Tax for hiring competent people like her. More power to you.< /review>

<Review>My First time doing my taxes.. I had absolutely no idea how or what to do so my co worker referred me to liberty tax saying that they give you $50 on the spot just for filling with them ! So I came into the office today and since the moment I walked in the door they were very accommodating ,kind ,and informative . The lady who helped me name was Dolores Flores all I can say is 5 stars ! Great Customer Service. Definitely Will be returning for my next Tax Return !😁😇< /Review>< Gmap_id>

Dolores Flores thank you so much you have amazing outstanding customer service you went above and beyond to make sure all my needs were taking care of my taxes especially how I shared with you about my last year taxes  it was a bad experience poorly handle with a lot of errors that I didn't get my refund from another company you offered to help me that liberty taxes offers free review and fix all the errors that this company did. Top it off I'm getting  triple the amount back for this year then I could imagine. Also not only that but I got $50 for doing my taxes and additional $50 for referring my boyfriend and he also did too we so happy with your amazing outstanding customer service we will be back again for sure thank you so much again Dolores Flores!!< /review>

Best place to do your taxes! They great you as you walk in and give you snacks. (Who doesn’t love food?) music is always fun. And Diana is the most helpful “tax lady”. And they give you free money just for filing! (Who doesn’t love free money?)< /Review>

< Review>
The tax professionals are kind and courteous that’s the only reason why I’ll give them 1 star, but I would NOT advise anyone to go to liberty tax they charged me $580 just to file a simple 1040 and I only noticed after they had filed them in the paperwork that I was given even though I asked upfront what they charged they said “they couldn’t give me a quote” until they saw my paperwork. I went to H&R Block last year was charged $250 and I actually got more money back , filed the same type of return and was expecting atleast the same amount back. Go to H&R or any other tax professionals unless you want to get tricked out of your money.</Review>

I was at this location looking for Diana because I have a little problem with my last year taxes and because i was told any little problem you might have just come to us.. completely bs.. not only Diana is not here at this location the only lady that knows how to do taxes is useless she doesn’t know to work the computer calling Mr Ken for any little problem if front of all the customer..! So unprofessional and rude ..! But they are so ready for Chismes and Chismes oh so they were saying not following covid distancing at all.. I’ll be taking my Business to a different place this year< /text>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Quick and easy. The prices are a bit higher than a competitor I was going to. The vacuum has great suction that actually got the dog hair out of my carpet and seats. I have experienced no waiting, which is why I switched. I was paying less, but could only access once or twice a month at the other place. I purchased the package that washes the rims, so far I have had to wipe down dirt after washing but I can tell that the rims are much cleaner.</review>< pictures>

Love washing my car here.... I usually pay for the bogo.... and save my ticket until I have time to go again. Well they expire, now I know. Not only did the manager say, Oh, it expired. I can't do anything about that, would you like to purchase a membership?..... then he crumpled my ticket for a wash I paid for and threw it away.....  worst experience ever. When I asked to speak to someone who could help me with the issue, he said yes I am the manager.... will look somewhere else to wash my car.<//Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>This is one efficient car wash... And whatever kind of detergents or polishes they use really make your car shine like crazy... I was going to cancel my subscription there because it was a little out of the way for me but when I went to cancel it the dude was so nice to me about it that I decided to keep it. I've tried all the car washes around here and pound per pound this is definitely the best car wash.< /text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Great car wash. Employees are always friendly. I come here weekly and always have a great experience. The drive through car wash does a great job and the self serve vacuums and towels work great.< /Review>

<review>I've been coming here for a while and service is good. Decent prices. You can also buy the price for one car wash and get a second car wash half off. I get the $12 and second one for $6 I do this since I wash my car every so often since it doesn't get super dirty. It works for me but there are other services you can do. Overall good place, haven't had any issues.</review><username>Barbara Gonzalez<//username>< pictures>

I tried out iWash for the first time last month since a co worker recommended them to me and I was so satisfied with their work! I went in for an interior/exterior detail and asked for Evil, he was very kind & professional and my car came out spotless and looked brand new! I’m going to be purchasing their monthly membership since they’re so close to me, and I loved the fact that their car wash doesn’t use rubber or plastic cleaners that can damage the paint. Instead they’re soft cloth fabric so I felt safe putting my new black car through their machine. Thank you guys!! ☺️<//Text>

The air fresheners although I know they are free and I'm grateful . It's a nice touch and they smell great but that really great scent only lasts a day unfortunately.  The only reason I mention it is because I actually really do like the scent. It makes the whole car smell so nice but like I said only for a day . It is a silly thing to say and I'm not really complaining. I just like the scent and I would pay if it lasted longer .</text>< date>

Normally great customer service. Today.... not sure what the attendants issue was but they have definitely lost my business! Owner- feel free to read my feedback left in the process of canceling our 2 accounts.<//Review>

The price is fair, and it is kept very clean. The staff are friendly. I did leave with bug residue all over my truck. I have had better results from a couple of other places for less money.< /Review>

Great car wash experience. The staff were professional and quick. I visited today to check out the new upgraded car wash. Attached is the video from the inside. Everything is new. My car is super clean. No streaks on the glass or wash spots. Very happy with the results. The place is easy to spot from the main road. There is also a vacuum area attached to it. 5 stars.<//Review>

Love this place, signed up for the monthly service were you pay $15 a month but can wash your car as many times as you'd like. We go there at least 6 times if not more a month.  Staff is always friendly and great to deal with.< /Text>

They provide towels to clean in and outside of your car. Was here almost an hour and they left me to clean my car. Other places give you max 10 minutes. Totally recommend this place staff is nice and professional too.</Text>

<review>I have a car wash subscription to this place and I have to say I'm very pleased with the quality of my car washes, the lines are never terribly long and if they are they go quick with the way the attendants move the cars through the wash. I do wish their tire shine machine shined my tires better but all good. Oh and they need a new music system, sounds like I'm hearing the music through a phone.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Rating>4<//Rating></record>

Quick and really good price for what you actually get. If you ever pay attention when you go through a car was and see what the machines are doing, you will know which places over charge. This place doesn't and they have a really good machine.< /Review>

< Review>
I've been to plenty of car washes before that they have the same system but I've ever been satisfied as this time. My car is brightening before I even start dry it with towels. Paulie is one of success' keys in this car wash because of his great service and attitude. I got my annual subscription for $100 so I can wash my car anytime for whole the year 😊. Get yours before they increase the price as this service has a very high demand.

The system is new and it's really powerful specially in removing all the mud on the car and the tires. Everyone has a spot to park the car and start using the vacuum and towels after that great car bath.

I rate it 6 out 5 ⭐s and highly recommend it!</Review>

<date>1540771048404<//date><rate>4</rate><text>I love this place. They offer a great deal for active duty military for subscribing monthly for unlimited car washes. The staff is very friendly. I take my car here every week.
The only reason why it is a FOUR STAR review is because the air fresheners they give are not good at all. I literally have like 3 in my car and I can not smell anything. They need to talk to SOAPY JOES because their air freshener smell BOMB! But they are still a good place for me and I just hope they upgrade the AIR FRESHENERS because that’s one important thing when it comes to car care.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

< Review>
TERRIBLE experience!! Who the hell charges monthly membership for a car wash?!! This is El Cajon! Not Beverly Hills! As soon as the smart mouthed attendant started giving me attitude, I said hell no. That’s not how you treat customers, especially potential customers! Plenty of good choices out there</Review>

Always leaves my car spotless with the basic wash but if you have a messy car make sure to clean it out before hand Because you only get 10min in the vaccume stall if they aren't too busy they let you stay longer but during peak hrs they really keep track of time<//review>

I usually will only ise the vaccumes once a month but i like that i can just quicky drive in and drive out and if my cars a little dirtier that week ill just loop around and go back in 1 more time.  I do wish they had better air freshners when they ran out of the personalized ones they had the little square ones those smelled really good. Wish they would bring those back or have otehr options. Id even pay for different air freshners if they had them.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

It is a good new car wash with fair price, they just need to add air and a narrower vacuum head thingy to better vacuuming tiny places in the interior of your car, I had the basic monthly membership that I am satisfied with.< /text>

Fast service and a very kind employee assisted me tonight around 8:30. I went to pick up a tub of Oreo ice cream and one of rocky road. These are in a freezer accessible to customers so they can pick and bring up to the register. Minus one star because the ice cream was way too soft, borderline soupy(attached a picture but don't think is shows how soft it was). Unsure if the freezer was on its last leg or if they purposely have the freezer setting that low. I live 5 minutes away from this location so it wasn't sitting out long at all. Been to other locations and have never had this issue<//text>

A combination of Baskin Robbins and Togo's, quite convenient. All the Baskin Robbins flavours you might love, as well as new flavors. The staff is very friendly. Ask for samples, they are bigger than normal. I recommend skipping the normal cups and cones. Try the tiramisu brownie special creation.<//text>

<Review>The service is fast but you can't see your topping options like you can at other sandwich joints. The quality of the foo d is very good. Nice and fresh.< /Review><time>1352946003758<//time>< Pics>

<text>Because this doubles as at Ho's as well, the staff is very lax, and is lacking overall attention..to customer orders, and general cleanliness of the facility. The yeah bone were overflowing, and the help seemed on a part with the customers being served... Stupid! I hope I don't have to go back there again. 🤔</text></record>

My family and I have stayed here a couple of times before and have always loved the service and cleanliness. However, this time around, more than an hour after we checked in for a room that we had reserved more than a month ago, we are STILL waiting to check in and are late for a concert we came to see. Never again will we be staying at the Hyatt Regency and never will I recommend to a friend. Very disappointed with my stay this time around.< /Text>

Owner shut it down and laid everyone off. It even evicted my Church, which rented it for Sunday services. Less than a month's notice is NOT considerate or professional.

Structure itself is decent but nothing to boast about. The toilets were so small and water pressure very low. Owner worked hard to maintain the 1950s look but the building has electrical and plumbing problems. The Church had to serve their coffee, which was terrible.<//review>

<review>I think recently renovated the hotel was fine.  We had a special promotion which I think made it acceptable as I wouldn't have paid more.  Rooms are a good size and clean.  Pool area is nice and the restaurant food for breakfast was good.  Comfortable location. I would stay again,</review><name>Archie Campbell< /name></record></dataset><record>

Stayed at the Sportsmen's Lodge for a wedding. What a rip off. I was charged a premium price for a very sub-standard room.
Room was dusty and musky, there were molds on the curtain, the bathtub was painted over (and the paint was peeling), and the hole on the bathroom door was patched with duct tape. I had to wipe down the balcony furniture before I am able to sit down. The hallway was dark, decor was outdated.
To top it off, my dinner salad had a caterpillar (it was still alive and wiggling).
Experience was definitely not what you would expect from viewing the Lodge's website. I wonder why they took those pictures. I have pictures that show what the room actually look like.

We attend an event there regularly. It is a very attractive setting with different rooms, depending on the size of your event. They have friendly staff that have worked there a long time and they remember you! Their food is very good but once in awhile overcooked.< /review>

<Text>I've been to two weddings here.   It's a pretty venue which feels secluded despite being next to a hotel and a major city street.   The food is surprisingly good.  I did notice they were giving a showing of the venue to another family in plain clothes literally minutes before this last wedding began which seemed very distasteful and distracting.   The bartenders look like they hate their lives,  but the service was quick overall. So, if hotel weddings are your thing,  this is a good choice.< /Text>< Rating>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Text>Hotel is nice and clean with some cool added bonuses, like tablets in the room for ordering room service, shuttles to universal studios, and private patios. Lost stars because this hotel is obnoxiously LOUD!!! Im staying on the first floor and I literally got no sleep. All I heard was feet stomping through the halls, doors slamming and coughing through the bathroom vent all night long. If you're even the slightest of a light sleeper be prepared to be up all night, the walls are paper thin. Anytime a toilet flushed from upstairs it sounded like it was directly in my room. Sad face. If you don't mind a vacation with no sleep then this hotel might be for you.<//Text></record>

DO NOT STAY HERE. Cleaning crew stole my Michael Kors sunglasses and cash out of my luggage. Besides that the quality of the hotel was horrible. The walls are as thin as paper. If you want to keep your things and actually be able to sleep, go somewhere else!<//Review>

< Review>
Vons has a great selection, but compared to most other places you have to pay so much more. Kind of place that makes you feel like prices are going up everywhere, until you go somewhere else and realize it's just Vons pricing. It is clean though....so there is that.< /Review>

<review>excellent customer service today at the store in LaVerne!  Just 4 You did not tally up to the correct discounted price (which is not unusual) and i was in a hurry and very frustrated.  Gentleman at the checkout honored the correct price without a hassle.  very cool.  then another employee ran out and caught me in the parking lot, then handed me my phone which i left at the checkout.  whew!

<Text>They have always been very helpful ( with a smile).    Especially, when I collapsed in the store, they gave me a pillow for my head to rest on while I waited for the paramedics to come.  Also, without hesitation they alway help me get the 24 pack of water bottles off the shelf and to my car.   Vons is the story of my choice to do my grocery shopping.<//Text>< Pictures>

<rating>3</rating><Text>Nice layout, people are friendly, but  most of the food is expensive.There is limited selection of meat other that beef(very little grass fed) and pork as well as fish. Not much variety in produce and ethnic foods. There is a good selection of wines and spirits but prices are not very competitive and you have to buy at least 6 to get a good price.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Love all the dairy free options! The employees were helpful enough but didn’t walk over to help you find what you’re looking for.

Edit: the berries I bought were moldy after only 2 days! Wont be purchasing berries from here again. I think the issue is that they don’t keep them refrigerated.</Text>

<text>They now havebanCA DMV kiosk inside no when you could submit a lot of paperwork and get the process started at least on alot of different things.  One of the best ideas, how did we not think about this a long time ago. Not sure if you can Update your photo with a new picture, but yes you can print out your tags.

I have loved the staff here for years. I understand Covid fatigue, but today when I shopped I saw three employees (one manager) with masks either under their mouths or noses or a mask with an outflow outlet, which does not protect others. If you expect the customers to product your employees, please lead by example.</review>

Always well stocked. Nice staff. This store needs to go back to the one line for check out. With having to keep a distance from people, trying to get in an individual checker line is a real pain.</Review>

<text>The new manager CANNOT handle a store this big. Or one at all. After Bill left (the old manager) and was replaced by this lady, this store has gone so far downhill that I've had enough of it. Once a joyful store, where employees loved to laugh, talk, and build relationships with customers, has now become a sad sight to behold. I have seen first hand at how poorly this store is now run. I have seen the manager yell across the service desk at employees that are helping customers. I have seen the manager grunt demands and orders at employees in a rude demeaning tone as if they are lesser than her. I have seen the manager walk past multiple customers and not even give them a single smile or hello. Not to mention horror stories I have been told by employees (whom I won't mention to keep safe) about how they feel that they are being treated. I feel as if the employees do not enjoy being there anymore, and I can only assume it's due to how they are now treated. It's a shame. I guess stater bro's is now the best option.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Things have changed since I was last there we no longer have to wait in a long line you just wait at the individual cashiers. I went after chicken unfortunately it was only packed in huge packages so I couldn't even get what I wanted. Because I was in an electric scooter I was afraid to try to pull a cantaloupe down from the shelf and there was no one to help me. I figured if I went about 7:15 a.m. I would not have any problem but I did , so no cantaloupe and no chicken.<//Review>

Staff is always gracious, helpful, and have scooters available for the disabled with the cart large enough for shopping a good amount. Halls are wide, and store is well lighted. Food is fresh well stocked. Club card brings down the price & great  points discount on gasoline. Great store. I love the fresh bread variety. Store is clean, especially the bathrooms.<//Review>

This is the place you can get groceries at discounted prices, and high quality. You can get birthday cakes, prescription drugs, meat, vegies etc.
The store also has discount gas stations. We like to shop at Vons, Costco very often.<//Review>

Vons is an awesome grocery store and this one is no different. So why the 3 stars you ask. This specific location is roughly .50/item more for my usual purchases than a competitor. I came for the gas discount but quickly realized I trip to the store cost me more than the .10 I was trying to save. From milk, to bread, to frozen dinners, to juices, everything was .50 more almost exactly. Also, the ad said dreyers was 5/2.88 but it was 2.99. Odd but that is just a little more than a .50 increase. Must be their magic number?<//text>

< Review>
I was never a VONS shopper until a few years back when I began to stop in for a few things here and there out of convenience! I noticed from the very first visit the employees are by far the best in the business! I have never walked in the door without being greeted like royalty by everyone working there! Having worked for the competitor for 18 years, I know customer service, and they have my vote for the #1 spot! I always assumed they had high prices. But to my surprise , many of their prices are even lower than the other stores. The store is always clean, and well stocked with product every time I go in! You can't walk past an employee in that store without a smile or an offer of help! They remember faces and treat you like family! It's a great feeling! I highly recommend this store to everyone!< /Review>

There were some good deals but I was overcharged for other items. Every time we go to Vons we seemed to get overcharged. It was a small amount but it is annoying to be overcharged by a dollar or two each time.< /Review>

Not the checkers fault...specials are not entered in the system correctly.</Review><username>Sherrie Guerrero<//username><GmapID>0x80c32fa4deb94583:0xb59109c8b65793d0</GmapID><user_id>104901264698820105325< /user_id><Rating>5<//Rating></record>

Produce is ok, standard fare, otherwise. Sprouts nearby will have higher quality and less expensive produce. Meats at this location are mediocre to poor in quality... better cuts and trimming needed to bring selection up to par with competitors.<//review>

Always courteous and knowledgeable. You don't feel rushed or ignored.  I just wish they'd carry Hutches BBQ sauce like they do in Fresno . Best ever.  I do notice that the dairy case/ milk is always empty.
But I guess that means their always full of customers!!
Love My Vons La Verne.  And the Starbucks too!</review>

<Text>I think that Vons has the best customer service of any grocery store I've ever been to they have a new manager his name is Jim and he is the best manager of a grocery store I have ever met. I think all those people there have a very difficult job and they do it very well I highly recommend the store.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

Very nice & well kept store.
It's too bad the prices on most items are extremely overpriced.
Yeah, you save a little with your Vons Card and sales but their overall high prices get you at the end.</Review>

< Review>
Von's... what can I say? An awesome store; feels like one of the "flagship" sites! Everything is top-drawer, incuding bakery, self- and full-serve deli, fish and meat markets -- I have only seen one of the "flagship" Safeways in Livermore, CA, and it had a full-serve sushi bar and a prep-salad bar!! Western Union is included as well; highly recommended.</Review>

Very average grocery store. Much more options than Stater Bros. But a fraction more expensive.< /Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) Super market where you can find everything, the only bad thing is the electronic teller machine that was left with my card, how bad you have done me. We are out for a walk and this happens to us, the only solution is to cancel the card. And no longer have this medium until reaching Colombia

Super mercado donde encuentras de todo, lo único malo es el cajero electrónico que ase quedó con mi tarjeta, que mal me has hecho.
