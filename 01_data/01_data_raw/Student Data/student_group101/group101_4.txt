< Review>
I took rental for couple of times for family trips. I usually rent cars from Airport since local facilities may not have much options. This place has good selection of cars. The rep was super friendly and the rental experience has been very pleasant, much easier, much shorter than the airports. The cars are clean. Flexible return options, opens on Sundays too (as of this review). I would highly  recommend this place</Review>

They have been consistently great, we have been using them for mini-leases for years. They always take care to give you the best vehicle they have and we've had no problems with exchanging them when anything mechanical has come up through normal wear and tear. The staff at this branch in particular seem to know the system very well and will give you a much more personal service than you might expect from a busy airport desk.

Only downside compared to a bigger branch at an airport is that the vehicle selection can be limited on busy days, but I'll still use them in preference if at all possible.</text>

< review>
Along with this review, i will write a formal complaint to Avis Budget Corp headquarters regarding fraudulent activity at this location. I returned the car in perfect condition and received a letter one month later stating that there was front windshield damage and they had repaired it and already charged me $600. I told them I drove the car and there was no such damage.  I wanted proof and they said "for small damages we dont take pictures!"...Unbelievable. I have already filed a fraudulent claim with my credit card.  Think twice before coming to this location.  There is something very shady going on with this site and the manager.< /review>

This is by far the worst car rental branch Avis has. I rent vehicles on an almost weekly basis for work. Rebecca runs this branch and has the customer service abilities of a rock. Rentals are ALWAYS dirty and something is always wrong or broken on the vehicle. Rebecca will ask you when you bring your car back "How was everything?" That's great, but when you tell her the truth, she goes off on you for telling her what's wrong with HER car! Do yourself a big favor and go to Enterprise!<//Text>

Just a few months ago I praised this place in a review in which I thought was great customer service etc...well I take THAT back, I will NEVER patronize this location AGAIN. I made a reservation to pick up @ 2 pm on Sat in which they close @ 2. My vehicle that I was picking up to transport broke down at a local manufacturer here in the area. So I hurried to make the reservation because I didn't want to be stuck for the weekend in a hotel with no Transportation until Monday. Now when I'm in the area I ALWAYS RENT FROM HER OR RETURN BACK TO THIS LOCATION AND RENT ANOTHER ONE. So knowing that they close @ 2, I tried calling to let her know that I was running late to pick up the car because of necessary paperwork that had to be done before I leave the manufacturer. I phoned the location 31 times WITH NO ANSWER, so I get over there one customer is inside and one outside taking stuff out of his car. So I pulled on the door, it's locked, so I'm waiting outside until she's done with the customer inside. When she's done with him, she sends the customer out the back door too keep from opening the front door. So now having to yell through the crack of the door to tell her I have a reservation for a 2 pm pickup..(mind you it's just 10 min after 2.) She's yellin back "We close at 2! I can't help you" Im like WOW really. I  tried calling you but you wouldn't answer the phone. I even was yelling through the door but I have a reservation. She just put her mask back on her face and turned her head back to the computer screen and ignored me. SMDH. I'm yelling through the crack "So you gonna do me like that?" Every time I need a car when I'm in the area I patronize your location and that's how you do me" oh ok.. So when ole boy that was in the parking lot was tryna to leave the keys from his rental he pulled the door and he saw it was locked. I told him you probably gonna have to leave them in the drop box. As he walks off...of course she unlocked the door. I'm like u gotta be F'ing kiddin me. In utter disgust.. I walked off the porch and call my bud to pick me back up and we dipped! Y'all can spend your money there...BUT I'M NOT. It ain't like she needs my business anyway especially with a attitude like that towards a loyal customer. I'll just rent from the airport locations and take them back from now on!< /Text>

<text>The Pleasanton Avis is easy to deal with and the staff is helpful and personable They had a choice of cars and allowed me to look at the cars to see what best fit my needs. She even made a suggestion on what car would work better  based on conversation we had about what I was renting for. The went the extra mile and I will rent from them again. The pricing was not outrageous either.< /text><Rate>5<//Rate><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

They never answer the phone while claiming to be busy. The lady at the counter is in a dire need of training on what customer service is, and also a bit on behaving decently. Super disappointed to have rented from this location. Though I was glad that I had made all the bookings and payments online and had to deal the least with the person both at check in time and check out time.
Also my advice would be to rent from the San Ramon location, its only 8 miles away from this place and the staff there is 10 times more cooperative and courteous.< /text>< Pics>

<Review>My daughter-in-law and mother went to pick up a car she had reserved for 6 months.  When she got there she was told they didn’t have her car. They waited 8 hrs in the office while the lady helped others.  She didn’t get her car until the next day.  Not only did she have to wait 2 days she also had to deal with a rude sales lady.
Totally unacceptable!!<//Review>< Resp>

My family was supposed to pick up the car right after landing but they couldn’t.  They had to take uber to the hotel to load their stuffs first and then take uber again on the next day to just pick up the car. It does not just only cost money but also our time (ALMOST 8 HOURS WAITING) and deal with tons of headaches. PLEASE STAY AWAY AT ANY COST!< /text>< Rate>

<review>HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERIVCE!!! Stay away from this place if you want to start your vacation with a happy mood. We waited for hoursssss and still couldn't get the car. What type of car rental service that is unwilling to give the car to you??? Only 1 evil rude lady works here - her name is REBECCA. If Avis still wants to have customers at this location, they shouldn't hire that rude unprofessional lady. NOT RECOMMENDED!!<//review>< pictures>

This place has the worst customer service I've ever dealt with ANYWHERE, in any type of business. Extremely rude service and was unwilling to provide a car, despite the fact that we were there an hour before they were set to close. By the time we had waited an hour plus in line, the lady apparently deemed that she was ready to go home and refused to help. PLEASE steer clear of here if you don't want to risk your vacation plans being destroyed.< /text>

What HORRIBLE experience with Staff. I had picked up a dirty vehicle that had dirt, stains on seats and carpet, leafs on the middle and back row. Leftover food, napkins and soda cups in the car. NO body picks up the phone at the location when I tried to report and call multiple times. Upon return Rebecca (staff) was beyond RUDE and charged me a cleaning fee of $30. I have never had this bad experience with any other rental in my life. She was extremely RUDE to me and many other customers while I was there.< /review>

<review>My company rents 100’s of cars daily from Avis for its company. When I went today the person working there was extremely rude! Rented a car, no Apple car play. REFUSED to give me an upgrade even thought they had a ton of cars and I am an Avis preferred plus member! First car stunk like onions! Second car smelled like body odor! DISGUSTING then she would only give me a Nissan Sentra which is a tincan with NO Apple car play!< /review>< pictures>

I can't even get them to pick up the phone 20 minutes before their closing time. Have been trying for over 10 minutes. Wonder if they close early if they don't have any business.</review>

<text>The customer service through the phone is horrible (the people in the office are great). The last two times I've called the local number is transfers me to the 800 number and the service is HORRIBLE. They never get the reservation correct! And when I wanted to extend my rental a couple days they were really rude and when I asked for them to transfer me somewhere the girl said "you have to call, yourself." I said "Fine. What is the number?" And she said, "I don't know!" SO RUDE!< /text>< Pictures>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>This particular Avis will try to get over on you, charging you extra fees for everything.  They have a policy about pets which they do not disclose in the paperwork. You will be much better off spending a little bit  more money and going with enterprise. I waited 15 minutes just to give the keys back because no one would acknowledge me at the front door. Very unhappy, will not be returning here.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<review>I’ve always had anxiety going to the dentist but thanks to doctor Nathanson she has made it a great experience. I no longer have anxiety and I feel comfortable going to the dentist. Thank you Dr. Nathanson For your kind and gentle bedside manner. I would also like to thank her staff they are always so pleasant and friendly.

Dr. Nathanson has been my dentist for 12 years now and she has been amazing as well as her staff. Always attentive and on time. I have gotten several procedures done with her and all have come out well with no need to do any repeats. Highly recommend her.< /review>

Excellent dental services, Dr Nathanson has small, gentile hands and she does a thorough job. I also appreciate that she has the technology to show me the indications of cavities on the monitor (if I have any) before doing any repairs. Sometimes I wondered if other dentists were leaning towards doing more repairs than were really necessary just so they could charge more. Not at Dr Nathanson’s.</Text>

Was a bit weary of going to dentist like always, but my wife had recommended Dr. Nathanson, So I went and gave her a chance. She quickly put my fears at ease and quickly fixed a cracked tooth I had in a matter of only two days! And my Crown was constructed in only 15 minutes! Now it sits in my mouth where the cracked tooth that would regularly give me pain and cut my tongue. Some people know how hard it is to find a reliable dentist who has a gentle touch yet does their job in such a precise manner like a surgeon! Dr. Nathanson has it all and I will be returning to finish any and all work needed because now I have the utmost confidence in her. It’s like when you find a good barber who knows your hair so well and makes you feel like they got your back you would never go to another barber again for fear of losing that experience, well she gave me the same feeling and I’m sure she would do the same for any of her patients!</review>

Smooth process from the very start! I am satisfied with the customer service, clean office and sanitization. I really appreciated the tour around the dental office and brief descriptions of the systems used. I thought that was very thoughtful and professional to feel welcomed and appreciated as a first  patient. Overall I am happy to have chosen this dental office for my future checkups and cleanups.<//Review>

This time I truly found the right & best dentist who will take care of me and my whole family. It’s my first appointment today. Clinic/office is very clean, well sanitized & cozy. Staff were so nice, good customer service & very accommodating. I had a great experience with Dr. Elvie Nathanson who listened and answered all my questions. She checked my teeth thoroughly and worked on what needs to be done first, very knowledgeable, did an excellent job!</Text>

< Review>
The beginning of October I had an appointment to remove my top two wisdom teeth. I was so nervous since I've never gotten through this before. Not only was Dr. Elvie very calm, but she would explain during the whole procedure what she was doing and asked if I felt ok. Eventhough I was very jittery, Dr. Elvie made every step of the way very calming. I appreciate her and she is the BEST Dentist I've ever had out of my 25 years of living. Great place! Totally recommend going to her.</Review>

I absolutely love to come to them! They know what they're doing,and are just awesome! I don't even get nervous when coming like before😁 I also love that they are very organized with appointments,  there hasn't been a time when i need to wait more than 5 minutes, that's another thing I'm very happy about. So thank you Dr. And the staff too.< /text>

Normally one would have to go to a Dentist to have a tooth pulled, another to have a root canal and another for implants. Dr. Nathanson does it all in her office. I've never known a Dentist to have the expertise and knowledge to be able to take care of all your dental needs. She's pretty Incredible. And her staff is professional and friendly.<//Review>

<review>Being newer to San Diego we hadn't locked in to a dentist for our family. Dr. Nathansen was recommended by a co-worker who has gone to her for years. She worked me in to her very full schedule to repair a broken crown. I found the whole team from front desk to the dentist chair, friendly, welcoming and committed to making a trip to the dentist as comfortable as possible. I've since had another crown done and the experience couldn't have gone any better. 2 thumbs up for Gentle Care Family Dentist!</review><rate>5< /rate>< date>

Dr. Elvie is a very kind dentist, as are all the ladies that work in the office, which I really appreciate as a sufferer of high anxiety. I had a full blown panic attack while getting numbed for a root canal and they were all so good to me and we’re able to provide oxygen and the comfort/reassurance that I needed to calm down to get through the procedure.<//review>

My daughter had an accident playing softball: the ball went right on her tooth, taking it out of the tooth socket. It was a Saturday night, the dentist office was closed, however I called the dentist on her cell and she told me to drive right away to her clinic. She saved my daughter's tooth. My daughter's tooth is today pearly white, not grey.
I highly recommend my dentist to everybody.< /review>

I’ve been going to see Dr Nathanson since 2005. Even while working overseas I’d schedule visits every time I was home on vacation.
Had a implant post put in while in the military but deployed prior to the crown being put on. After 10 years with only the crown, Dr Nathanson spent months researching the post manufacture. Finally I’ve got a crown.< /text>

I had scheduled an appointment about 11 days before for a Monday, i get a call saying they can't see me because the scheduling can't see the main offices schedule and they overbooked! I mean how can that happen? shouldn't they be using the same system to look at scheduling...anyway they had to reschedule me for 2 more weeks out which is BS becasue i already had my PTO scheduled and i cant take it off 1 day before the appointment....i havent been seen here but definitely wont have my appointment made here...<//text>

Im sorry to say that but I will not be returning to Dr. Nathanson. Her staff especially the front desk clerks are extremely polite and professional but i can say the least for Dr. Nathanson. Her unprofessional behavior with her assistants while working on a client is extremely rude. She became frustrated at her dental assistant while with a needle in her hand and cut my sons gum due to her negligence. My family will no longer need her service and its a shame due to the sweet staff she has.<//text>

Thank you for a great experience, I appriciated your sensitivity and care that was given to me during my visit. I was pretty nervous about getting my teeth worked on and your explinations reasured me. I especially appricated the follow up call that I was given to see how I was doing. You guys were great.<//review>

Dr. E. Nathanson is one considerate dentist I know.  She will find time to accommodate anyone to treat even on a busy schedule.  Her treatments are skillfully performed with extra care to make you comfortable sitting on that dental chair.  Dr. Elvie Nathanson is highly recommendable.</Review>

Dr Nathanson and her staff will cheer you up and will always share stories that will make you laugh thus making my dental visit no longer dreadful but a time to catch up while they are doing a whole lot of TLC on your teeth!!!</text>

This place used to be very good before Covid 19. Now it sucks being 1) way over priced; 2) the noodle bowl almost got nothing but rice noodles. They charged $13 per bowl and it size is tiny. I ordered a beef stew rice noodle bowl. It only comes with 4 tiny beef stew cubes and some rice noodles, that's it. For the price I can have a pho from Loi and doesn't cost me as much.< /review>

<Text>Good place, not overcrowded, and relatively cheap prices. Only thing that is not convenient is that this place accepts cash-only. I know this has nothing to do with food quality which is great, but the fact that all nearby restaurants accept cards kinda makes it as point that you need to consider. Anyway, go to the ATM, get a $20 bill and come try some great noodle!</Text>< Rate>

<Review>Great quick spot for noodles. You can build your own bowl and choose the ingredients and broth. Flavor is authentic and not too salty, service is quick and prices are very reasonable. My go-to spot for great comfort food.</Review>< pics>

Flavorful broth and the spicy dishes have heat!  The veggies included with soup have just enough crunch. Small is 7.50$ and nice portion. Cash only.  There is a BoA atm one block away.</review>

I love this food!! The homemade noodles and dumplings are the clear go-to items, but everything I've eaten here has been great. My 6 year old son says it's his favorite restaurant. There's often quite a wait - we try to go early (5-ish) to beat the lines. HD Chinese Yunnan Rice Noodle< /Review>

A wide variety of topping and soup bases for the noodles. I tried the original soup base, with beef and shittake mushrooms, very good. Might go back to try the spicy soup base.< /text>

Very good noodles for a reasonable price, with tasty toppings and very light clear broth.  You choose how much spicy you want your soup.

Great tasting noodle! Very reasonably priced!  The "spicy beef stew lo mein" is a good starter dish to share with your friends before you all dig in on the big bowl of soup noodles.</review>

Very disappointed how a older client & I got treated by Isaiah at 2pm. Right away when walking into the store I sent my client to the left to select a color for his backsplash. I approach the counter and happen to make eye contact with Isaiah. I could tell that he was not in a good mood. So, I gave him a chunk of painted drywall, I asked him if he could match the color. After 15 minutes we receive the quart of paint. We then gave him the color we picked for the backsplash. After another 15 minutes, it was time to tell Isaiah that we were not satisfied with the match. I set my client outside for fresh air since it was already extremely humid and hot inside the store. I said I wasn’t satisfied with the match. He got irritated and toss the can into a bin. After said I’ll charge you for everything else, stating he could no longer help me. As soon as I was finished paying my client walked back in. I started to walk away while Fred was trying to wave and be friendly. Isaiah 10 refuse to even acknowledged him but had the nerve to say out loud next time know what you are looking for! WOW!! I really hope this guy is not the manager because I feel very bad for his staff. He was very unhelpful and seem to be mocking me because I wasn’t familiar with painting. Very bad experience for all employees, guests and members in the store today.

I am using the name Isaiah because that is listed on the receipt. I did not happen to ask his name directly I wanted out.</Text>

Expensive paint that's worth it.
I like the folks that work here. No nonsense and very helpful. Having troubles choosing colors? Hire their colorist. The colorist will even make house calls to work out all the details and help to coordinate your color scheme. We'll worth the $90 to have someone help us in deciding home colors. The paint here is the bomb. Long lasting with easy application and cleanup (latex, air sprayer/brush). Try to buy during sale periods to save a buck. $66 per gallon can be had for $50 during the right time. Even then, $66 is worth it if you're only having to paint every 20 years.</text>

I want to give a huge thank you to the store manager, Daisy.  There was a mix up with my paint order.  Daisy heard my problem, was very apologetic, and hooked me up.  Even though I had an issue, I left feeling very happy and satisfied.  Great customer service at this local store!</text>

<text>When an order is placed. Have the order placed. I phoned and placed an order with Issah. He said it would be ready when I arrived the day after. However, it was not.

I went to the store to pick up some paint samples for repainting the interior of my house. The employee at the store was very helpful and told me about the different promotions for the month of November. I will be going back to the same store to purchase what I need before the end of the month. Thanks<//text>

This is a great paint and supply store.

I needed to patch up several walls, repair and paint,  this store matched my paint samples perfectly,  instructed me on how to paint and showed me what supplies were needed.

Originally I was going to hire painters but after visiting Sherwin- Williams,  they convinced me I could do it and probably saved me $500.00 for the work.

Now,  I walk around the house looking to paint anything.....< /text>

<Review>Our business switched to Merchant Processing Group at the end of July 2019. We have been happy with the service of Merchant Processing Group. They were quick to send us a new processor when an electrical storm took out the machine. I believe we had the new processor within 24 hrs. That's great service!! Also, if we have questions, they are very helpful and gracious and come alongside to help resolve any issues. We have a seasonal business, and our season will be ending within the next couple months. We have found that Merchant Processing Group has very reasonable rates during our "down time". We appreciate this company and their great service. From what we have experienced, Merchant Processing Group wants our business to succeed so that theirs can succeed as well. Thank you, Merchant Processing Group.< /Review><username>Nidhi Kumari</username><pics>None</pics>< user>

<Text>Merchant Processing Group is an excellent credit card processor. It is easy to use and I have not had many issues that needed to be resolved, but when I did, it was easy to resolve. One phone call and done. The machine is very easy to use and was provided free of charge. As a necessary overhead required to do business, this company makes the fees hurt your bottom line less.< /Text>< UserId.>

From the initial call, to our business formally engaging them as our merchant service provider, the process was seamless. Their sales, onboarding, and support staff completely understand customer service and have "super-served" our business. I am officially a Merchant Processing Group fan, as they have truly delivered for our business. Our merchant services fees are down nearly 60%!< /Text>< pics>

<Review>I haven't been using Merchant Processing Group too long but am very glad I made the switch from my former card processor. The few times that I required customer service they were extremely helpful and re-confirmed my decision to make the switch. Likewise, the fees are much more palatable.

We didn't realize how much we would be saving, even though we were given an estimate I had to see it to believe it. And they held true to their estimate we are saving around 500.00 a month. Super easy to work with and a very helpful team. I highly recommend Merchant Processing Group.< /Review>

We moved to Merchant Processing Group last year after having used our bank's recommended credit card processor for three years. We were hesitant to make the move but our only regret is that we didn't move to Merchant Processing Group sooner. They have been extremely easy to work with, utterly transparent, we get our money deposited much sooner, and the fees are dramatically lower. Recommend Merchant Processing Group whole heartedly!< /Text>

I have been using them for close to a
year. My business has been saving
anywhere from $95-$145 dollars a
month compared to my old company.
There fee is reasonable. Currently any
savings for a business is great.</Review>

So glad I switched to Merchant Processing Group! I was initially leery that switching would save me money; however, it has. The multiple fees charged by past merchant service providers does not occur with them. When I first started, I had some minor technical issues that were addressed and resolved right away. The platform itself is extremely user friendly. All in all, I would recommend others that it is worth switching to Merchant Processing Group.<//Review>

Great product. Easy to use and excellent integration into QB. Truly little disruption to our processes once the credit card information from our current clients was transitioned. And most importantly, significant savings compared to our prior merchant service company.< /review>

We are a large retailer and have been using Merchant Processing Group since we opened our business. We rarely have problems with our credit card machine it’s always fast. The few times we have had problems we have been able to get them resolved quickly. Very positive and stress-free experience. The last thing I want to be stressing over is if my credit card machine works!</Text>

I began accepting credit/debit/HSA/FSA card payments in my outpatient psychiatric practice with the onset of the COVID pandemic. I did a lot of research and learned that the merchants who charge a flat monthly fee are more cost effective and Merchant Processing Group's was the lowest I could find. They had an extensive security vetting process, which was comforting, and the few initial hiccups that I encountered were easily fixed because I was readily able to get someone on the phone in a reasonable amount of time. The onboarding, once past the security clearance, was easy and the Virtual Terminal is ridiculously easy to use and makes me think I may not need to actual hardware Bluetooth terminal offered for in office use once I begin seeing patients in my office again. Once the pandemic is passed, I will maintain the relationship with Merchant Processing Group.< /text>

Finding a good and honest merchant service provider (MSP) is very difficult nowadays. In the past three years, we've had to leave three MSPs because of dishonest fees or batch failures (basically, this is when a merchant doesn't receive funds earned in their bank account). We have now been with Merchant Processing Group for about three months and I'm happy to say that -- so far -- there have been no unpleasant billing surprises. Merchant Processing Group is honest and upfront with their fees. There was one technical error where we didn't receive the full amount of funds earned, but Merchant Processing Group's friendly support staff resolved the issue within 24 hours (other MSPs could take up to one week to resolve processor errors). Small businesses looking for a good and honest MSP should seriously consider Merchant Processing Group.</text>

I love her oils. I had a couple bottles in storage for 4 years because I moved across states and when I took them out and used the oils they still smelled the same as when I first purchased them. I am a forever customer.</Text>

Ordered a book, and received an empowering care package. Lightning fast shipping all the way from Cali to Nashville. I’m really looking forward to placing more orders, and sending more business your way. I couldn’t ask for a better online shopping experience! 🙏🏾</text>

I ordered a book online since I am too far away to go in-store. The book arrived quickly and was wrapped in a protective layer on top of being well-packaged for shipping. They also included some bonus items from their shop which was sweet. I will definitely be visiting in person the next time there is an opportunity!</Review>

Back in 2013 went to the store seeking knowledge my daughter had cancer and was in the hospital she needed a donor . I was tested and was a match for my daughter. But I had some health issues that I needed to clear up so I could be her donor. I had three weeks to get my body in order. I took what the doctors gave me. But I wanted to do more, went to this store got the knowledge and the products that I needed to help my daughter live.The doctors were even amazed at what I had accomplished in such a short time.  I got beneficial knowledge from the owner of this store and I am forever grateful. Best of all, my daughter is 7 years  cancer free.< /Review>< Rate>

This is one of my favorite shops ever! I buy my body oils and Shea butter from here. The people are beautiful and welcoming. I don’t actually live in Long Beach I actually live an hour and half away going north and I would drive there before I found out they had a website. That’s how much I love this place.</review>

The owner Renee has built something truly special here. I first found Shades of Afrika just walking down the street I decided to stop in and take a look. This store would set me down a path of greater body awareness and taking care of my health.

Here I discovered shea butter and the incredible value of essential oils for daily use in life.

I would come in here for body care products, and leave everytime with a bit of wisdom and inspiration from Renee in addition to great products.<//text>

My go to place for body and essential oils. I also purchased many earrings, an ankle bracelet, birthday cards, body soap. Ultimately, this is a one stop shop. Make sure you bring enough cash because you will wanna shop. I'm never disappointed when shopping at the Shades of Africa!<//Text>

I am all for supporting black businesses which is why I wanted to support this store. Someone I met actually introduced me to this place. I've probably visited 3-4 times this yr. The owner is often too candid with her responses and often shares too much information. Customers can just solely want to make a purchase and leave without being lectured. I think her intent might be good but it's the way that its delivered that cannot be received the best. The line is also very long usually. I'd prefer more focus on getting people in and out the store than the banter that takes place that sometimes have no substance or is rude. I think the customer service can be improved upon for 2020.</text>

Great customer service! I live near Washington, D.C. and I ordered two books (7 Little White Lies, and Stolen Legacy). I called the store before I ordered online and spoke with Renee Q. regarding some questions I had prior to my purchase. She was extremely courteous, knowledgeable, and professional. I will continue to patron Shades of Afrika.< /text>

Great "hole in the wall" store. Excellent selection of hair and skin care products, oils and incense plus art.  Seems to be primarily West African. Knowledgeable and friendly staff interested in helping customers, not just selling products. Hope to check out the Corona location soon</Review>

<review>Very cool spot, great one of a kind business. Plenty hair products for curly hair, there even is a hair salon inside. Also a lot of great skin care products, from jojoba oil, coconut oil, almond oil, apple cider vinegar, books on black history and culture, spiritual merchandise, like incense and sage and books, music. The people are very cool every time. Very one-love one-world people, has a very spiritual culturally proud and forward thinking vibe, I love it. Smells so nice too, when you just drop by.
I always load up on skin care oils in here, and have always splurged on various small souvenirs also, they have jewelry and small purses, accessories like that. Love the shae butter balls, they are about a fist sized!< /review>< pictures>

<rating>5</rating><review>I was in Long Beach 2 years ago and asked around for a shop that sold Body Oils and was directed to Shades of Afrika. From the moment I entered the store I felt welcome and yes I found what I was looking for with Renee's assistance. Her knowledge of her products is great and the customer service is #1 bar none. I have since ordered several products online form Shades and they have delivered promptly and I will continue to shop with them as we don't have this type of store where I live in Hawaii. Thank you Renee and I look forward to continuing to patronize your store online or in person.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Great store. Great atmosphere. Nice owner that’s knowledgeable. I love the store for coming for my first time there. Besides it’s nothing like spending money with your own people. I’m definitely a customer now via online or in store thanks appreciate it. Just go it’s so much in there. Stop complaining about the prices when some of y’all will spend money on the wrong ones. Not your black fam.< /Text>

I love Shades. I have been coming by for 1, 2, 3, haha probably 16 years! This is a very warm and welcoming place with something for everyone including yoga and meditation on Sunday, open mic night on Saturdays, and lectures. The owner is a very special lady and I feel different, more tranquil, or learn something new every time I stop in.< /Text>

<review>Went in there last night. The place sucks. Really does. Lady keeps bragging about her crummy products. They insisted on a donation for me to watch performers. The show was shut down early so I asked for my donation back and she got angry with me. They had 7 people in there just talking about nothing. No show nothing. It was terrible and was treated extremely rudely. Very bad. If you want to have a lousy experience, go to Shades of Afrika.

<Review>My friend and I was just in this store this past Saturday, May 4th, and we had a wonderful experience! My friend comes all the time but I’m fairly new to the store. We stopped in to specifically get this soap, Benas soap, which is amazing for your skin. It’s a lil expensive to me but it’s worth it. We both picked up several other items during our visit. I just love this place! Lots of beautiful & unique products, artwork, books, oils, gifts etc., and the ambience was amazing! If you haven’t already checked them out you should. You won’t be disappointed! It’s a lil slice of Heaven on earth♥️</Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

I love visiting Shades of Afrika, I always leave this store in high spirits. This stores has everything you need from toiletries to books to yoga classes to open mic nights. There is also an all natural beauty salon next door. Shades of Afirka is bringing sexy back and I guarantee you'll love yourself even more for visiting the store.< /text>

So glad I found this place! Amazing line of natural products for skin and hair. There's so much to see, you really cannot be in a rush, especially your first time in the store. Although it's a bit of a drive from where I am, it's worth it just for the natural hair products & unique items for gift and home.</Review>

Update : my last visit I asked about some cuffs.  She didn't have any and assured me she would order some!  Today I went in and she'd placed an order and they were there!  I can definitely appreciate that!

Absolutely love this place!  Poetry is A1!  I was on my way there today but noticed you are closed (its 4:22pm on Sunday) ...  I'm sad!  Well,  there's always Tuesday !  Lol.  I lost my Ankh necklace and I need a new one.</text>

I adore this place. This is where I pay my tithes, because of the excellent service and knowledge that is gifted into my life with each visit. There are many shades, if you will, to this space; all moving toward total body health & clarity of mind & of space. The owner doesn't mind when I simply stop by and visit Kizzie and Kush, two wonderful statues that stand in the ground over 600 years. I have grabbed gifts for my grandmother and brother here, I really cannot say enough. Shades of Afrika is a gem, a crown Jewel, even. You can catch me there once every other week. Stop by, you will not be disappointed. Peace, ya'll!< /text>

A little overpriced for essential oils and their fragrances wear off quickly. The shop owner is kind but she spent the entire time lecturing me and two other customers on how we should take our money out the banks and buy gold coins instead. She wouldn't stop taking so i ended up putting 3 items back on the shelf and left without buying them. Ugh!<//text>

HORRIBLE HOLIDAY EXPERIENCE
I've gone to this store several times over the years and like the incense. Always got a bit of an attitude but no big deal until today... bought $40 worth of incense...scents in separate bags, I wanted a jar for all of it. Paid half gave them a day to hook it up. Next day I got 25 separate bags none labeled and no jar.... I called the shop to ask why no labels or jar? The reply I received was really stupid and delivered with an attitude that inspired this review.

I will not go back again they have no concept of customer service.<//text>

<review>I just had to write a review on this store and  I gave it 1 star because it has all the products I need and then some..I like shades of Africa. It has all the products I need but it's expensive. I would think that since its black owned they would be less pricy for the community ( black) but this how black owned business owners operate. They want black ppl to buy " black" but they have high prices along with bad attitudes, I guess it'll never change. The owner.. I guess she's the owner, I really don't knw how to read her... Sometimes she's okay, other times she is rude and dosent speak when ppl walk in, the prices are damn high here,  it's crazy! She's always trying to lecture about spending ur black $$ wth B.O.B but black owned businesses are to pricy and her business is  too! And this is why I don't spend "black" cause it's robbery! Plus this lady charges to use your credit/debit card on the machine. She's doing the exact same thing as the Chinese ppl in the nail shops, they charge a fee to use ur credit/ debit card, a fee they are suppose to pay, not the customers! But ppl don't knw this.,,The xtra fee she charges her " black ppl" is the fee she suppose to pay her self! But ppl either don't knw this or don't care, but she knows better but does this anyway, and always trying lecture people when she not right within herself! Lady if you are reading, and I'm sure you are.. Please change your attitude and the way you treat your customers! Remember we are the ones that put $$ in your pocket to keep going, I know many ppl that "USE TO" shop in ur store, and that includes my daughter, these ppl don't shop in your store any more because of your attitude it stinks badd! You runining your own ppl away wth your badd ways., is this what you want?.. Do you even care?! And some ppl knowing you are kinda crazy with that badd attitude still shop in your store anyways., how can u run a black business and treat black ppl wrong, then try to lecture black ppl on anything about black history, or anything else?! Some times I wonder if you are sincere about teaching black ppl about their blackness or are you being fake just for sales... idk.. But ms store owner  there's also a few reviews about you on Yelp.. Some good some not so good.. Go read!...wake up my sista!<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Time>1624487172875<//Time><Rate>1< /Rate><review>**MICE INFESTED APARTMENT, HEALTH HAZARD**

I lived at Veda from 12/20 - 1/21.

- During that time my room mate and I found multiple mice in the apartment ranging from small to near rat size. You can hear mice crawling and scratching on the walls above you at night. Disgusting, makes you feel like you're in a 3rd world country.

- After finding the first mouse, they sent their maintenance team who found multiple openings behind cabinetry in the bathroom, kitchen, etc. that were promptly patched up.

- After that, we found multiple mice over the course of several months in the kitchen, bathroom and in one of the bedrooms.

- There was never any accountability, they refused to fumigate and sent an incompetent pest control vendor who literally just set up mice traps and said there's nothing they can do.

- I thought about filing a formal report with the city although the process was more than I wanted to deal with.

- This is VERY old building, don't be fooled by the renovation. I also have reason to suspect there is mold in the walls, again not worth the time for me to investigate, glad I left asap.

The only redeeming quality about this place is that its in a relatively decent location and looks nice on the outside. Just know what you're getting yourself into before you move here, there's a reason its so cheap!< /review>< pics>

<Text>I have lived here for more than a decade and while we have had some issues through the years (i.e. 3 car break-ins, bike stolen from bike room, missing packages) my overall experience has been good.

Nicely renovated building in a great location. Love the gym, parcel lockers, and outdoor space. The maintenance team, both past and current has always been excellent and I enjoy the community events that that management puts on.

I just read another review in which someone had a rodent problem (yikes!). I’m terrified of rodents and have never had that experience. However I hope and pray management has fixed that issue because that would be a deal breaker for me.< /Text>< pics>

The building is making an effort to fix the various issues although make sure you tour your unit and look detailed. And some neighbors here are dangerous do not engage.< /Text>

We have moved into the Veda while building our home and have been here since December.  I find the building to be very well maintained and the staff to be wonderful and very responsive.  My only complaint would be that the smoke detectors are too sensitive so go off all the time when neighbors are cooking.  Having run many luxury properties myself, I would highly recommend The Veda</Text>

The people who work here, primarily Hastea and Missy, are the only reason why I’m giving 3 stars and I adored them dearly so none of what I am going to say pertains to them because it is out of their control. However, there is a lot of shady things that happen at this apartment complex in regards of the people who live here. I’ve seen drugs (needles especially) in the back ally, police are constantly patrolling because of the creepy motel next door, and the parking garage in the back will you have up all night. Fire alarms go off throughout the whole apartment complex 2 times a month and the elevators don’t work a lot do the time either. The developers who redesigned the apartments did a sloppy, quick job in terms of the painting, door hinges and air circulation for the vents too. In addition, the parking is horrendous if you have more than 2 cars and people will ding your car with no hesitation (it happened 3 times) so If you don’t mind these things, then maybe this is the place for you! :-)<//review>

< Review>
We are living here for almost 2 years now. In the past two years this building changes 3 management companies, one worst that the other one. We constantly have problems in our apartment. But the worst is knowing that our and our children's lives are in danger since we have been dealing with robberies and breaking into cars. Its been 2 ties already in one year!!!!! that someone broke into our car and stole our belongings. Can you imagine living in a place that you don't feel safe and the management does nothing to protect you and your belonging. We needed to waste 3 days of work in order to find a place to fix our car, to call our insurances, to find a replacement car and then to take the replacement car back an our car back and dealing with the insurance. I have 2 small babies. Can you imagine loosing working days and not having a car to take them to daycare and to do arraigns. Besides that, we constantly don't have hot water in one of our showers. They stopped the water for maybe 5 days in different occasions to fix it. but guess what? yes they didn't fix anything. Our washing machine didn't have hot water for a month. so i needed to wash my babies whites by hand since no hot water were there. Also our dish washer got so many problems and it took forever until they realized they needed to just replace it. Another issue is with the elevators in the building. They constantly stop working so you needs to walk into different areas to have one elevator work and you cant go up to your apartment for the parking since the elevator doesn't work, therefore need to walk with tons of groceries miles until you get into your place. Moreover, the people they send seem to have no experience of how to fix things and we need them to come over and over to solve the same issue. I none of the times, the door fell in my babies room, they could be dead if it wasn't during the night. Imagine them playing in their room and suddenly the door is falling on them... horrible! Also - they took the door and said a new door will be i a few days. It took them 3 weeks to bring a new door. those were the worst 3 weeks since the kids had problems falling a sleep and we needed to be so quite all the time. and why? i believe if someone read it, they had enough reasons why not signing any contract with this building.<//Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I have been looking for a new place for a while now and was starting to give up hope until I came across this complex on apartments.com. The photos are what really attracted me, then I saw some of the reviews and became a little skeptical about whether or not to consider this place. I decided to give it a try anyway and was pleasantly surprised. The Leasing agent Briana was thorough and very competent. She  walked me through the whole process and was very friendly, accommodating and considerate. Every question was answered perfectly and I felt comfortable knowing I was making the right decision. Be sure to ask for Briana, she’ll do you right! I’m so happy I took a chance.<//text>< Pics>

I love these apartments! I have to say that what other apartments really hit the mark on is the maintenance crew. They are responsive and get the job done when you need it! No need to wait weeks for them to finally give you a response and then “fix” what you need. Management is also very great and respect tenants. Would definitely recommend these apartments to anyone looking.<//Text>

<Review>Dishonest Staff. Poorly kept building. Non existent manager and owners that are not engaged. I have a small claims against the building approaching next week.

One year at the grand.

- vomit as soon as I move in due to a stench.
- breakout of fruit flies, in the thousands
- leak in ceiling, had a hold in my ceiling for over a month. Never fixed issue.
- promise made to remodel but all I dealt with was people entering my unit while I wasn’t home
- overflow of trash cans
- outdated elevators with expired permits
- DO NOT MOVE HERE. DONT LET THE PICTURES FOOL YOU.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOAXp4sj-A_x7eBIu0-zdHkYMVUhHPArEsd7Opi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNa1q5QrLvhCRZ0GnpzDdawIKaQ41FVlEXqFtK9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNATN1xuThPfYRHsU9T7DGbkLky9UrPVVOwiUMn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMprrnNYqLnmN0Tza9IetsEf83QgBs-cy7zcL4K=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbxl5v7OPR5RZrjpGVtwXlsK89Ze1deDzpcnt9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSpVr6DyT63UfWM8v0HGDtDGze2rvtqeA-2F_B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMydpDO-j01ifx3FZIfAUF92PHwo5Qx3aJ7h7gv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMk_ARpC9cL-5wqMdfnakb7NR6ivrWtwhdQ-AXq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfQREa2UEi3gU1VjOZDd4vm0BracTCYQvHmIo0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOsIdqZjDWZYb2vEx_F5FvkNbZEAGu6wbZ-gGnj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN22poLLeJZu-qTS6VWS_Kr5aC_wPhimRrkGzeb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLjR9uHMays6-k6N9ZsyW_KAZgYShVC6fnSYK5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDxRI1FNLphQdh4yHGBGLJKdTG5XvILliA6XJs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgmt9875mH0LrIbBO2PCuT7V1vEawSQBEnBpSv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNO3RRCDx1lmrXUBXTe1rHD9lC-J130I44m7sXq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpHuTZVw1pTPVUeU8xL4GMApppc7QWyx5AMMxb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< response>

<text>Overall I really like living here. It’s a great location and a safe building. The amenities have all been closed due to Covid but I look forward to trying them once open.  From the time I first inquired about living here I’ve worked with the assistant manager Hastea. She is very friendly, responsive and helpful. She goes the extra mile to make sure the tenant is happy which is a rare quality these days.<//text>< Date>

These apartments are very luxurious and worth the price in the location that they are in. Communication with office and maintenance staff are more superior then the other apartments that I have lived in, in the past as well. The maintenance staff is very quick at communicating and attending to my needs. They are also very polite and understanding. I would highly recommend living here because of the location and the communication that the office and maintenance staff give to their tenants.< /text>

<Review>I stumbled upon this hidden gem and decided to book an appointment. I was shocked to see that the complex resembled a luxurious hotel. It looks exactly like the photos. The customer service was amazing, thanks to Briana. Any question I had was answered. The specials are unbelievable. I will be making Veda my next home.< /Review></record>

This community is HORRIBLE. Do not sign a lease. It looks pretty (common areas) but the issues you have with management are ridiculous. I saw the reviews and I said hmm that won't be me...11months later it is. The 5star reviews are employees and even the company attorney. its all a facade. You will regret moving here. so many people terminate their lease just not to deal with them and pay a month rent as their fee. Don't waste your money you will be disappointed.< /Review>

I love this place!!!! My experience here has been nothing but positive!!!! The amenities are amazing, all I need is for the gym to be allowed to be opened. As a tenant, I can’t praise Hastea enough. She’s constantly going above and beyond, she’s just wonderful. The residents have been wonderful too.< /Review>

Honestly, I was a little skeptical about whether or not to consider this place due to some negative reviews, but then decided to give it a shot and I’m glad that I did. Hastea was the leasing agent who walked me through the whole process from the first appointment to the move-in date. She was very friendly, accommodating and considerate, and made sure that I had all my questions answered.
Have been living here for almost three months and so far have had a positive experience: the cleaning crew does an amazing job, maintenance was fast to respond and if I need anything, I know that Hastea is always willing to help.<//review>

I love it here! I do appreciate that they take the time to make sure that the building entrance/amenities smell great.

Hastea helped me transfer from one apartment to another. She was great, very helpful and professional.

Melissa is kind and helpful I have had few issues with maintenance but Melissa always makes sure that they get it done.</review>

Melissa Guerrero and the rest of the management team have a wonderful friendly personality. I've had a pleasant interaction with all of them throughout the last year. They are attentive with placing work order into the system but the only obstacle is the cycle time to close some work orders is long - they have a lot of opportunity to improve on helping close work order faster. Nevertheless, the staff is friendly and attentive and wouldn't mind continuing a stay in Veda and keeping the great relationship going with the management team.</review>

<review>Been living here for a little over two months now, Hastea made the process very easy and has been helpful with our questions and concerns. Despite initially being turned off by the reviews we have not felt like we made a bad decision at all and enjoy living here.

Edit: This is not a knock so much on the staff but there is an enormous amount of theft that goes on here. I have personally had at least 8 packages stolen including medication. This is not something that only I have run in to as there have even been notes left by other residents in the mail area asking for people to stop stealing. A package of mine was literally delivered 45 minutes ago and not even 30 minutes later it was stolen. Veda has sent mass emails stating they don't have responsibility over this at all.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1601400617024, 'text': "We're so happy that Veda has proven to be a wonderful place to call home!

I have lived here at The Veda for over 2 years and I love the remodel. Melissa and Becky in the leasing office are extremely professional, they pay great attention to detail and they do an excellent job of trying to create a strong positive sense of community at the property. Anytime I have a maintenance issue they get it resolved with a sense of urgency. They are so pleasant and welcoming everytime I go to the leasing office and I especially like food truck Wednesdays. They know all of the residents on a first name basis and they both showed empathy for me when I had back-to-back losses in my family. That is what sets them apart from any other community I've ever lived in.</text>

This place has improved since the new supervisor took over earlier this year (2020). Getting help and assistance with maintenance and on lease questions is much easier these days. Throughout the covid situation they have been understanding and flexible - which I’m grateful for.< /Text>

I moved in 6 months ago and love my apartment. Washer and dryer! Before everything shutdown I used the gym and the clubhouse when my friends visited. Great to be able to walk the galleria. Just stinks now that everything is closed. Maintenance even walked me thru fixing my garbage disposal since they couldn’t come in because of Covid. Office team did cute care packages with wine and toilet paper. It was perfect. Plus weekly yoga classes.< /review>

This is place is clean, maintained, a management is extraordinary. Garbage disposal, pest control, smoke alarm broken all fixed in a day or less. Hastea in management is incredibly responsive, kind, even went the extra mile to try to find foster parents for my cat when he got lost because he accidentally slipped out and a neighbor found him. Very pleased with living here and comfy as can be<//Review>

<Review>I love the building and my apartment. The staff is also very nice. However, I believe they may be understaffed. I've had to follow-up many times (consistently for almost 2 weeks) on a single work order which did not include anything major.

If you want a place to keep your things and sleep at occasionally— this is it. The pictures might fool you. I did feel safe here and the units are cute! BUT this is the worst management experience I’ve ever had. They are never at the desk, or answering the phone, when I have questions or need help they are reluctant or rude.  I have maintenance requests from 9 months ago they never fixed, so I had to fix them myself. The elevators are unsafe and jump when you get in them. Sometimes so hard the door opens again, thinking you e arrived at the floor. There are constantly plumbing issues that they are always fixing. Honestly this place needs some serious work. They rushed through the construction, and they cut A LOT of corners. Don’t expect greatness when you get here.< /Text>

If I could give this place negative stars I would… They are absolutely the worst apartment building I have ever lived in my life. Everything is broken, they don’t fix anything, they never get back to you and they’re incredibly disrespectful. I canceled my lease and paid them one months rent just so I can get out of there early and this is the email they sent back to me today after I’ve already been out of the apartment for three months.

“Hello Jessica,

Unfortunately, you do not get your deposit back. You owed us money. If you have any further questions please contact formerresidentcare@greystar.com. “

<review>Veda is everything my new fiancé and I were looking for to start our new family. From the first call through the whole leasing process Hastea the leasing agent was absolutely amazing!!! Such a helpful and welcoming attitude, working with her made us immediately feel this would be home. Granted it’s covid so many of the amenities and the close conveniences have been closed we know this will just enhance our experience upon opening again. We have loved our apartment and their attention and care to keeping the facility clean. We are very happy being here.<//review>< pics>

Living in this building has been one nightmare after the other. Management is completely inept and there are still unresolved issues from when I moved in 2 years ago. Management constantly sends inadequate  notice of entry which does not meet the 24 hour window required, they have entered my apartment multiple times without any notice whatsoever, and they ofter turn off water or power without remembering to send out notice to residents in advance. This has been an unbearable living experience. I would give zero stars if I could.<//text>

The building is constantly under construction. We were told we would have a new washer dryer within three weeks and it's taken nearly 3 months and they still aren't finished. Moreover, people who use the public washer dryer are aggressive and regularly take clothes out to spread on the floor after its been sitting for 10 minutes. Construction has massively increased the costs of living without making the place significantly nicer.

Residents are woken up by fire alarms on a fairly regular basis at 2 AM. The water is shut off all the time and the price for water is shared resulting in a large water bill. Work orders only fix issues around half of the time, and the resident portal website has many issues. Office staff used to be fairly friendly, but with staff turnovers they've gotten more stand offish, although they are still nice sometimes.

The closed parking lot gate is not actually secure, any car can enter if  they want. Oftentimes people were parking in my spot late at night with nothing to be done about them. The building has had a lot of construction, but nothing to fix security issues.

Many of the facilities have been closed for a decent amount of time because of construction. The apartment itself and location are actually pretty nice but nothing could be good enough to forgive these other issues.<//text>

DO NOT let the new pretty decorations they're working on fool you. This place is the worst kind of nightmare. Especially stay away from Michael--from my experience with him and the other reviews I've read about him, he's a bit of a monster. But The Grand doesn't care about tenant satisfaction, they care about their bottom line, so it's likely he'll remain there.

Alright, let's break this all down.

1. We toured in Jan 2017 with Anthony and he told us there'd be construction and installation of washers/dryers into each unit, but promised ours wouldn't be touched until we moved out. Bold face lie--they started a "3 week" construction project in our unit that lasted well into November because they screwed up and had to start over. Rent would not be lowered and anyone who refused was evicted.

2. Because of all the construction throughout the entire building, one of my roommates stepped on a rusty nail in one of the stairwells leading outside. We sent two emails, one of them being directly to the project manager, Justin. Neither were responded to and no action was taken. Not even an apology.

3. There seemed to be a discrepancy with our move-out agreement, as we received a bill in the mail for rent through the end of January despite having already officially moved out January 3rd and our move-out agreement being signed and submitted in time. I was told to disregard that bill after calling them out on it, but I'm in disbelief that it was sent in the first place.

4. Speaking of billing issues! We couldn't pay one of our rent payments on time because they did not bill us for that month. They hit us with a late fee for that despite it not at all being our fault, and they would not just eat that cost themselves without getting something out of it for them (despite it, again, being their fault). So Michael said he'd only do that if we wrote a positive Yelp review. He extorted a positive Yelp review out of us so we didn't have to pay a late fee that was in no way our fault. We have since updated that review to reflect a more accurate portrayal of how our experience at The Grand went.

5. Water was constantly being shut off, fire alarms would blare all the time and in the wee hours of the morning, the credit card machines in the laundry rooms were constantly broken, elevators were regularly broken or out of commission for "maintenance," the pool and exercise room were closed for a majority of the time we lived there. We even found dog feces in the hallways on more than one occasion.

6. Now, at the end of it all, I signed a paper with a quote for what our move-out costs would be. It's almost hysterical how different those costs ended up being. They quoted me $75 to touch up the paint. They charged us $265. When I brought it up to them over the phone, Michael tried to argue with me. He said that since one of the other costs was quoted at $120 and ended up being $16, I should be fine with it! Because it evens out!

No, Michael, the fact that our general cleaning cost went down from $120 to $16 does not in any way make up for or "even out" the difference from the $75 for painting I was quoted to $265 we were actually charged. Nevermind that the numbers don't even out at all (still close to $100 not being "made up" for there), the fact that we were quoted one thing and were met with a VERY drastic change is completely unacceptable. Valiant effort though! But maybe don't take such a snippy tone with me next time?

Everyone you encounter at The Grand will lie to you. From the very start, before we even signed a single paper, we were lied to by Anthony. We were lied to by Justin about the status of the construction project. We were lied to about our move-out costs. All every one of them does is lie.

The Grand clearly has a very severe customer service and management issue. I assume no one cares about that so long as they get their paycheck so c'est la vie. Hopefully people reading these reviews will heed all of our warnings and stay as many miles away from this place as possible.</Review>

For 3 months we have no hot water from the washer machine and all I got it's promises that they'll take care of it. my carpet in the bedroom is broken since I moved in and nothing being done to it so far. They had a leak on the parking garage from the old Plumbing right over my car about 2 months ago, and I'm still waiting for the reimbursement for the detailing I had to do, no to mention that I still have a brown stain from the rust on my car. On the kitchen I have to let the water run for at least 5 minutes until hot water is coming out, (so match wasting off water and they don't do anything to fix it).
The building was remodeled not too long ago and it looks real good, but the Quality Is very very poor.<//Review><rate>1</rate>< UserId.>

Worst management team ever. They don't respond to your demands. The "online" system sucks. The building is under construction. Don't believe them when they say the renovations are going to be over soon. I had a leaking roof that took them 7 months to repair. Fire alarm goes off like every week. Elevators are always down. Garage doors not always work.< /review>

Awful place.  Awful management.  Building is falling apart. Homeless people sleep in the lobby and parking garages.  Cars are broken into regularly.  The amenities are all broken down and made as cheaply as possible.  Elevators are no safe, disgusting, and never inspected.  There are a few squatters living in the apartments (most units are empty) and the place reeks of weed and dog poop.  This is one of the worst run and kept buildings in Los Angeles.<//Review>

<Review>I tried to be so understanding and accommodating to the construction and constant issues, but after a few months of promised amenities never showing up, the cost was too prohibitive for an apartment with no amenities, no convenient guest parking, constant water shut-offs, and a constant flow of workers in and out of my apartment, I moved out. One of the main elevators has been broken since August, and the ones that do work are slow and poorly programmed. I say this to especially warn those who are unable to take the stairs. I tried to discuss the high move-out costs with them, but they were inflexible and the costs were higher than my deposit.   The people who work there try to be as helpful as possible, but I really ended up losing a lot of money living here for what I got out.<//Review>< user>

Love this place so far. We just moved in a few weeks ago.  The amenities alone are crazy.  I can finally stop donating to the gym, we have a full gym downstairs...free weights, machines (including that really good stair master that I can only do for 5 mins.) and even the rope thing that the extra healthy people use (lol).  The common areas are clean, the maintenance staff handles items very quickly.  Melissa was very patient and showed us as many units as we needed in order to make a decision (don't do that to her though...lol), but she was awesome.  Greg has a wonderful sense of humor, don't let his "listening face" fool you.
I'm glad we are here, we love being here....oh and the sunrise from the Sepulveda side...wow...ok I'm done...</review>

<review>The building owners have no morals or standards of decency when signing tenants. They lie to their property management staff who then unknowingly lie to tenants who are stuck in long term leases! Washer dryers are TWO YEARS behind the promise to hook up as rents INCREASE every year without appliances promised. Building maintenance is way behind schedule and apartments are left for tenants to sacrifice time and money. Staff does not stay for long so there is always new personnel to deal with.  Find any other option but this one!  We would not be leading here if we could get out!!!</review><user_name>William and Diane Smith</user_name><Rating>1< /Rating><gmap_id>0x80c29794e7fba15f:0x3a94aec3b9e87bc5< /gmap_id><Resp>None</Resp>< Pictures>

< Review>
DO NOT MOVE HERE !
THE WORST MANAGEMENT TEAM and maintenance I have ever seen and the WORST apt to live in. Mike at the management office was a little less rude than the super rude dude at the place (worst cop and bad cop situation). Elevators have not been working properly for more than 5 months. My clothes were stained by ink at the laundry room and all I got was "It is not our responsibility. I do not have to answer this." by a rude, disrespectful management team member. I could only live here for 5 months and sign a release form with the roommate's and management's agreement. After months of me leaving the building with an agreement signed by my roommate and the building management, I received a call mentioning a balance not paid by the previous roommate. I had to re-send the release agreement to the company and waste my time on something done wrong by Grand apartment management and IQ data international. And not even an apology after I was proven right. I sincerely do not recommend this place if you want a peace of mind.<//Review>

This is our (My husband and I) first apartment together, THE GRAND made it the worst experience ever.
We moved in on August, they told us that the entire remodeling gonna be over by September. Of course it didn’t , then we’ve been told it’s gonna end until the end of the year! Maybe they meant  the end of 2018?!?
Water shutting down unannounced few days a week, maintenance responding to requests at least 3 days later.
The main entrance to the building is open all day and all night.
they put a security guard outside, but he is usually sleeping in his car.
I can go on and on on my bad experience I’m just so disappointed.
We learned our lesson, hope you will learn from ours.
I won’t recommend this building to my enemies.</Text>

I really wish I could give negative stars. I am posting while I still live here as I've seen people tour the place recently & I just wanna yell out "DO NOT DO IT, RUN". When I moved in there was a pool, theater, gym, great lobby and NO construction. Fast forward 8 months later and there's ZERO amenities (aka our rent is paying for construction) and not even a lobby. Construction was supposed to be done in May, it's October and there's no end in sight. The mailboxes have been broken into twice even though they were behind a locked door. Building doors are frequently propped open in the alley allowing literally anyone to walk in. I've heard we have security guards but I've never seen them. We had bugs in our kitchen cabinets and had to have people come multiple times to resolve the issue. Water gets shut off frequently "for construction" but it also happened before they began work on the building. If you are home during the day and take showers or do the dishes between 9-5, you won't always be able to. The elevators don't always work so those with a physical need for an elevator should not move in. The fire alarms have gone off at 2am multiple times and stay on for up to an hour - great way for us to never know if we're actually in danger. The laundry rooms are always disgusting with puddles of water on the ground (they say they're installing washer/dryers in units but I wouldn't hold my breath on that due to their track record with other work). They gave 3 day notices on construction that was to be done INSIDE our apartment (and every other apartment). This construction is demolition requiring the residents to move all of their belongings out of their rooms for 3 weeks. To where? Who knows, good luck - they'll threaten with a fine if you say you won't do it. There's a severe lack of communication with the management office regarding any issues and they are not respectful of your space. While all of these are current issues, there's no way of knowing if anything will change down the road. I wish I'd listened to the warnings of previous tenants before jumping at what seemed like a good offer. Supposedly the renovations will make this a great place but unless they renovate management you're going to HATE living here.< /review>

Wow, I lived in the Grand from 2005 to 2009 and from the reviews on here I can see that this place has only gotten worse.  During my time there it was very noisy, the strippers and adult stars would make noise at all hours of the night.  No enforcement of the quiet policy.  The night time security guard with the tattoos was very shady, I had two motorcycles stolen from the underground parking and I'm confident the security guard was in on it.  I was very lucky to pay 1550 a month for a 2 bedroom when I first moved in. When I left, the rent was 1990 and the building was falling apart.  My brother lived there in 1999 when they had 2 Jacuzzis on the roof, the building was decent back then.</review>

<review>If i could give this building 0 stars, i seriously would. DO NOT CONSIDER THIS BUILDING if you are actually looking for a normal place to live in.
We moved there in December 18 and ever since we moved it has been a living nightmare. Management does not care about your problems, elevators keep not working, dirty elevators, it is like a college party every night and with the echo in the pool area and the neighbors screaming and playing loud music its  living HELL. The security is not really helpful as we kept on calling them due to noise issues and did not get any response (they also only come in at 10PM and not a 24/7 onsite.
BOTTOM LINE: STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!  We moved out after only 6 months in and had to pay the full extra month, even when we tried talking to the manager she apparently had no time for us at all (even though she has time to walk to the cheesecake factory for lunch).

Horrible place. Can't find out who the owners are! Do not move in!! On site people are great BUT for one thing, they've been renovating the building since February with no end in sight. Constant problem with non working elevators. My husband just had back surgery & has to use a walker so if the elevator doesn't work it's s very little v walk for him for us to get to another elevator to get yo the garage. The water is shut off very frequently because pipes burst due to vey d construction. It's one thing after another & of course no break in the rent. Sometime we get hot water (always a wait time(, sometimes not. Again do not move I. Here!<//review>

<text>CONTINUED FROM DELIA TAFOYA REVIEW. So after the water roaches...
This place also has a big problems with flies.
I move into the new complex and I still do not have a washer and dryer. Staff tells me washer and dryer will be installed in 2 weeks. Weren’t installed until 5 months later. So not only did we wait over a year to get the washer and dryer when they told us at move in that we were planned to get them in 4 months. Another issue. The parking. So we moved from a 2 bedroom with 2 spots to a 1 with 1 spot. You think it wouldn’t be an issue with the street parking and a visitor parking lot. Street parking is either metered or only 2 hours. IF YOU LIVE HERE YOU CANNOT PARK IN THE VISITOR PARKING OR YOU WILL BE TOWED. So not only do you pay so much to live here but their is not adequate parking. Let’s get back to the rent. So I paid $500 more for the 2 bedroom than my 1 bedroom, according to my lease. But when you get your actual rent balance, they add an extra $200 a month to include pest control, water, sewer, garbage, and another gas, and electric bill on top of DWP and SoCal gas you already pay. So you pay 2 gas and 2 electricity bills to live here. The neighbors: oh my god, Jesus take the wheel. Almost every other person that lives here has a dog that never stops barking, they smoke weed so you can’t walk out your door without getting high, or they do hardcore drugs. I’ve had drug addicts who lived in the building trying to break open my door or running through the halls at 3am. Every one of my neighbors has dogs that never stop barking or they let their dogs pee in the hallway and don’t clean it up. I used to live in Van Nuys and let me tell you. That apartment was LUXURY compared to this one and I paid $1500 for a 2 bedroom. It was on sepulveda and vanowen. This apartment is like a hot girl with a bad attitude. “It doesn’t matter how pretty you are on the outside if you are the ugliest person on the inside.” I’m sure I could think of 100 more complaints but please. Hear me out before being sucked in. I am a well educated/experienced human being and I can say whole-heartedly. This place will take everything you are worth and have 0 regard towards your well-being. All the amenities seem nice but the elevators are constantly broken down. Water is shut off every month. The swimming pool is only 3 feet deep and always urine colored. The gym equipment is either stolen or dirty enough to give you ring worm. I’m sure I could conjure up 50 more problems but I think that’s fine for now. Please read my other review under Delia Tafoya, I am trying to help others to not go through the pain I’ve been and still going through. It is the corporation behind this building so they will never change no matter what concerns are voiced.< /text>< Pics>

<Text>I REPEAT. DO NOT MOVE HERE!!!!Since we've lived here it has been nothing but negatives. In the last year BOTH me & my roommates cars have gotten broken into & they take absolutely no responsibility, a lady who parked in front of our spaces had HER ENTIRE CAR STOLEN! They have no cameras in the garage which is unacceptable. Water is shut off multiple times a week. There's public access to the apartments because a back door to the alley is always open. I have caught security sleeping multiple times. I'm not one to rant but it's honestly not worth the trouble. We were actually warned THE DAY WE MOVED IN as one tenant was moving out and thought he was just raining on our parade, but no he was just being honest.< /Text>< date>

There is no worse place to live.  The water is constantly turned off to the whole building multiple times per week.  The fire alarms go off all the time.  The staff is completely worthless and lazy.  Dogs are barking all hours of the night. The location to the galleria is okay but there is actually nothing in the galleria worth going to.  The elevators never work.

Horrible Horrible place.  Any option in Sherman oaks is better.</Text>

I had a tour scheduled for 12:00pm my wife and I were running late so we called to let them know.the phone rang and then a voice message said someone would be with us soon.it kept ringing and then went to voicemail.no big deal.we get there and the lady touring basically called us liars that we didn’t call because they’ve been answering calls all day.even the cleaning lady looked surprised she talked to us like that. She asked if we wanted to reschedule. We looked at eachother and said no. I’ve never seen my wife so mad.that lady completely disrespected us and has no business working with people.your business is only as good as the team you have running it.</review>

< Review>
Lived here for a year. The lease spoke about all here amentities that would be available to me; Pool, Jacuzzi, Gym and a Washer/Dryer Unit in the apartment.

3 months in, the complete remodel started taking away from those amenities. Fast Forward 4 more months, the construction and installation of the Washer/Dryer Unit are some. But we are told that we cannot use it, because it still has to be inspected on, to make sure it operates properly.

Jump ahead to the end of my Lease and the Washer/Dryer still we’re not ready to use. The lease said it would be ready to use by April 2017. I moved in in February.

Besides amenities that were completely taken away from me during my stay. Water was constantly shut off every month, typically at inconvenient times too. Fire Alarms going off atleast twice a month. A maintenance crew that never followed through on repairs, (The floor above me, had a leak that seeped through the ceiling into my bedroom, kitchen and living room. Damaging my TV and PS4, while also damaging the wood and paint. Causing them to scrape away the damages and simply paint over just my bedroom. But left the construction holes in my living room, unattended. Oh and his happened by month 4 of my lease.).

Enough rambling, I gave this place the benefit of the doubt and figured the simple construction going on would be tolerable. I was wrong. The Leasing Office doesn’t care about any of the tenants, (Unless your living on the PH Floor and paying the big $$$) as long as they get their money and abide by the law, they could careless about your needs. Any complaints or repairs needed, will be overlooked and you will be ignored.

There’s so much more to say about this place, but I’m not gonna waste my time anymore.

I DO NOT recommend this apartment complex to anyone.</Review>

<Review>I lived there for a year and a half. the leasing office is horrendous, the alliance residential company, the people who own the building cannot answer emails or calls as my lawyer tried to reach them multiple times. they are liars when it comes to construction and completing things on time. Multiple times people had parked either in my parking spot or blocked me in, in my spot. it is a TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE place to live. I have taken them to small claims court for the damages they have done.</Review><rating>1< /rating></record>

Hands down the worst place I ever lived in. Staff steals your packages and management start remodeling the entire building and your unit while you live there. Moving to this place is a bad idea. Do not make the same mistake I did.<//text>

A nightmare in building form. Don't move in.

Do yourself a favor and do not go into this building do not sign any lease do not believe the lies they tell you about when the repairs will be finished they'll shut your water off without notifying you. Their sales rep Jasmine made promises like having the repairs finished by January 1st or at least the washer and dryer in the units by that time and none of her promises were kept. When I specifically asked her if there are any other charges regarding the rent she said no and I ended up paying over 100 on average for amenities I don't currently have and have to split the cost of their constant water leaks as a shared water bill. When you first walk in the apartments look really nice and well-kept but those are just the model. we found multiple issues with are moving apartment some of which have not been repaired 6 months into the moving.
Can't wait until my lease ends.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Most disgusting place to live in that ive ever encountered. From homeless people blocking the entry to my building (I mean sleeping literally on the ground to where you cant even walk inside (can be scary as a single woman coming home at night). The people working there are terrible and beyond petty. Any time ive ever had an issue my responses are never returned! IF you live here I promise you will be dissapointed. TO the never ending construction thats about 5 months past what they said. When I first signed the lease I was shown an apartment that wasnt even the one I ended up getting. To the "plans" they show for the building that are NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN! We were supposed to have washer and dryers installed into the building over 7 months ago. CAN YOU IMAGINE LOL! 7 months at this apartment and legit none of the things they promise you on the first day are even happening. LOL! Do not waste your time or precious money living in such a trash placed ran by such a trash management company. Mind you, I NEVER WRITE REVIEWS! I feel so strongly about this building that Im logging on to even do so. Its a PERFECT LIE living here. Seriously do not be fooled by leasing agents. None of the plans are happening. NONE!!!!<//Text>

I just find myself getting more and more annoyed living here. My main question is who is rating this place a 4 or 5. Non-stop loud construction that vibrates your apartment (6 days a week), leaks, loud fire alarms constantly going off even around 3AM and 6AM on weekends when you're suppose to catch up on sleep. Water constantly shut off, get stuck with other peoples bills, $50 for garage opener (rather than charge you replacement cost they tack on a margin) and plenty more mistakes. Slum lords with bad business etiquette.< /Text>

***  DO NOT MOVE HERE. I REPEAT... DO NOT MOVE HERE.   ***

The worst thing about paying almost $3,000 a month for an apartment is...  NOT BEING ABLE TO LIVE THERE BECAUSE OF THE CONDITIONS!!!

I will be posting pictures on a daily basis to show you the conditions that are acceptable for the management and ownership of this building.

My roommate and myself could not even LIVE in our apartment for 1 month because of a BUG INFESTATION caused because of neglect to our continuous calls for our garbage disposal to be repaired. We could not use our sink for 3 weeks so the bugs moved in and hatched in our pipes connected to our sink. This led to hundreds if not 1000s of bugs infesting our apartment. We called and called.. Emailed and emailed... They finally sent exterminators who came by after first canceling their appointment because of rain then show up a few days later. He did a quick inspection of the place and stated he had no idea where the bugs were coming from because there was no food in the entire place. He told us to make home made bug traps and would come back in a week. We continued to complain (while not being able to live in our place for that time period might I add) but nothing was done. He comes back the following week and it was even worse. He then said he'd come by the NEXT WEEK to spray our place.

Week 3 - he comes by and sprays the place. This was the first time they went away... For a few days. Then... Guess what.. They came back! Why? They found some crevice in the pipes. Keep in mind we still have not had a maintenance guy come up to check the pipes like we have asked connected to the sink . Week 4 - the exterminator brings back some special "apple cider vinegar" traps and tells us there's nothing else he can really do because it has to be something in the pipes. Later that week we FINALLY FINALLY get a visit from maintenance for the building and they do a treatment for the sink....

Please note... We are now 7 weeks from the original bug problem and are still dealing with it.

We have contacted management so many times it's ridiculous. When you're not able to live in your apartment but still expected to pay close to $3,000 per month in rent, it's ludicrous.

We contacted management and now ownership for just that ONE month in rental reimbursement...  But guess what...  DENIED!  Seems like a reasonable request when you are not even able to live in the place right??

I spoke with the manager Aaron yesterday who has not been helpful WHATSOEVER and tried to blame the bug infestation on us yesterday for having food left out when both the exterminator and his staff have told me and my roommate they know there is no food in the place. The manager then told me "my disposal wasn't broken for weeks and I didn't have that problem." For one, how is that even acceptable... But main point is... How can that be your reasoning? Ludicrous

This situation just goes to show you that management does not care about their tenants. They blame the problems of the building on their guests. I feel BAD for Sean and Godson who work for these guys because they have TRIED to help but have no power.

Here are a few other issues with the building:

1) the pipes to your showers are so backed up...  Expect to take a shower in at least 8 inches of water. They have tried to fix this about 3-4 times.

2) the area is not safe. It is next to a motel that has interesting clientele. I've had to contact security many times because female guests are scared to come here

3) the place is dirty. There was an old pizza outside an elevator last week for the entire week.

4) the place is extremely noisy. Parties go on all night every night so don't expect a good night's sleep.

5) to be continued....

Almost everyone who moves here leaves when their lease ends.

Posting pictures on a daily basis to show everyone of the horrible situation we are in.

DO NOT MOVE IN HERE....  ANDDDDDD....  DO NOT LET ANYONE YOU KNOW MOVE IN HERE!< /Text>

This place tries to be fancy, but the people that run the building are very incompetent. I heard this from resident after resident I bumped into when I first moved in, and didn't understand why so many people hated the management. After living here for a while I started to notice why. Almost once a week they shut down water to the whole building in order to fix one pipe. They place 24 hour notices on everyone's door the afternoon before they do it, instead of the mornin before.<//text>

Please know that we have the elevators tested annually by the City of Los Angeles, and while all permits are up-to-date, the actual permit from the City takes some time to be delivered to us. In the meantime, they do put a temporary sticker on all elevators showing they are up to code. While I understand the renovations can definitely be frustrating at times, please know that we are doing everything to make your living experience this best it can be. Understandably, during renovations of amenities, for the safety of you and the rest of the community, we cannot have certain things accessible while they are being worked on. We have also provided alternative access in place of the amenities lost, and hope that you utilize them to their fullest potential. Please contact us at (818) 905-5888 when you have an opportunity, and we will be more than happy to try and turn your experience around.'}</Response>

Worst possible experience! The water is always cold. There are false fire alarms all the time including about 30 min ago which almost gave us a heart attack. Lots of traffic noise. Dirty Hallways, and more..</Text>

(Translated by Google) We live many years in the grand.
First the administration is a badly educated racist mess
Second, the alarms were going off all the time
They stole our clothes from the laundry section

This lady is Amazing!! I'm so glad I found her!! This hair is intense!! I had no idea what I was getting in to but as expected it was awesome and my hair turned out SO GOOD!! I'll definitely be going back to have them redone when needed. Amazing selection of hair and all different types/lengths/colors. Not to mention the skill level is TOP! I'm excited to go back!! Very happy.< /Text>

First timer but for sure a return customer!!

It’s easy to book your appointment online, no need to leave a deposit or anything thing of the sort, but if you don’t mind a gamble you can also walk-in and if available they will take you.

The salon is large, clean and well managed. You also have a large selection of hair and body products. The pricing is fair. Not high/ not low, just the right price for an excellent service.

The ladies are polite, respect the time and I felt very comfortable there. +1* for Shamkong that took care of me and did my hair. She braided me like a queen!<//Text>

<Review>I couldnt find another location in Irvine which does ethnic (African) hair or has the corresponding products needed.
1. Miss Lynda is a gem, and the other ladies who work there are wonderful.
2. This here is the work of Miss Pat. She is such a sweetheart.
3. Come on a weekend to get your hair "did" and then some African food as well! Jollof rice, plantains, lamb, zobo.... so much to love.

They also have just about any product you need. The thing that is most important to me is love. When Lynda comes in she sys hello how are you and hugs everyone. It makes me feel at ease and at home. Thank you for this positive experience 😊<//Review>< Time>

<Rating>3< /Rating><Review>Very very expensive. Went there for the convenience and because of the lack of ethnic beauty supplies in the area. The store is the smallest beauty supply I have ever been to. It’s a low volume store. I inquired about twists that I had done many times before and they cost $200 there and the braiding hair is $5 per pack. Decided to get the hair there but go to another salon that charged $165. I’m from FL where braiding hair is $3-4 a pack and Havana twists are $160. Very pricey location, but very kind women and many helpful employees for the size of the store.<//Review>< Pics>

Amazing customer service and amazing work. I got box braids and Lynda was able to fit me in last minute. They came out beautiful and the girl who did them she has really gentle hands. Honestly thank you guys my hairs look amazing!<//review>

I have finally found the garden of Eden for braids! Not only were they able to squeeze me in at the last minute but the young girl with similar hair as mine slayed my braids. I've been getting compliments non stop. When you first walk in its a little overwhelming but when I say they have and can do everything it's no lie. Parking wasn't too bad at all and the price you can't beat. Not to mention the great service from literally everyone in the shop..don't bother going anywhere else this is it. I'll be coming back!</Review>

<Text>Warm and friendly environment. This is my second time getting micro braids, and I absolutely love them.  The prices are very fair, and the ladies are well knowledgeable of every style. Lynda's herself is so sweet. My new home for braids!!!!<//Text>< Pics>

Ms. Lynda is a very nice stylist, loved the new look she helped me to achieve.  It was quick and I was home before dark, even after going over straight from work.  Give her salon a try, loved the family atmosphere as well. Thank you ladies!<//Text>

Lynda was an absolute sweetheart, and I'm so happy to finally have a place to buy braiding hair in Irvine!! She is extremely knowledgeable about her product, and uses it to make sure it's high quality. I couldn't ask for anything better!!<//Review>

<Review>Most of the time we have a pretty good experience at this replant, but this time it was not. The main worker a guy who looked like a viking was being a complete jerk to not only his coworker, but also the customers. Kicking the cans away from the next customer. Throwing items he deemed not recyclable back at the customers almost hitting me with them & yelling hurry up. We hope next visit we have a nice worker that makes the a little more bearable.</Review>< pictures>

Just turned in 119 worth of cans, bottles. The guys there were very friendly and helpful. They were able to take care of me, with a full truck load, and still help all the people that came in with little amount. I got a fair price. I recommend them and will be going there next time.< /Text>

My son and I come here to recycle. It's about what you'd expect for a recycling joint. Fairly fast service, but they do work on a strict schedule, meaning when their break time comes, you gotta wait!< /review>

The tweaker with the braided ponytail is hella rude. An old lady asked for a bin and he literally threw it at her. When he's not there it's 5 stars. The other fellas that work there are on it and get you in and out<//review>

<text>If there is zero star I would put zero, very very bad service and rude attitude. I was told no bottles yesterday and will be accepted tomorrow. So I took everything back and come today but they can not take bottles either. Since I rarely go to this location to do recycling. I put all plastic bottles in one bin, the attendant yelled at me:” I will put you at the bottom of the line if you don’t separate it.” What a terrible experience. They do not want to work there! I will not go to that place ever.< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>Terrible first and last impression. Man bun in Rocklin by Walmart barks at me when I pull up at 1:45 they're going to lunch come back at 3 and walks away. Both of you? Don't stagger your lunches? And for an hour and 15 minutes? Slightly closer to my house but will stick to the  place in north highlands that's open on Sunday until 2 they act like they are running a business.

They close at 4:15 instead of 4:30 and the white trash druggy guy is rude and tries flirting with my wife and other women.

I have had no issues at all with this center. Workers are always polite. If you go to this recycle center at "the wrong time" they can be really busy because everyone in that area using this center. But there is usually only the one person, working his butt off. No one can go any faster (to the woman below). Side note, I didn't have any issues with Rocklin either when I lived there for a year.</text>

I tried the Pacific Avenue, Rocklin location next to Walmart.  Very slow would be an improvement.  People were lined up 8 deep.  After a truck changed out recycle trailers two of the THREE employees disappeared in the back.  The third swept and stood around doing nothing.  The people in the front of the line said that they had been there nearly one hour.  Two people left because of the wait.  After 35 minutes I left.   In that time not one bottle or can was processed.<//text>

The fact that the lady down below thinks he was the jerk, is indicative of the attitude of the people in Rocklin. So glad I don't work in the service industry there anymore, the majority of people in that town treat you like garbage. This place is as good as recycle centers get. A lot better than Berry St. where the guy yells at you at the time. Get over yourself, Rocklin.</text>

Been using this location for sometime and have been very pleased, until today... It is a joke that they will only pay a quarter of a penny for glass even though their sign says 10 cents.
They are npt a recycle center but a crv reimbursement center. Glass is glass, clear or collored is the only difference and I may be wrong but in recycling I dont believe that is even a major factor, but again I coyld be wrong.
It is not all about the $$ but really the principal of the whole thing.< /Text>

<Text>RePlanet Recycling is actually located at the end of the Wal-Mart parking lot, but google point is set on actual Wal-mart building. And when I drove to it using navigation I was confused and drove around, but realized that actual  re-planet recycling center booth is located on Wal-mart parking, when you turn from Pacific Rd just drive to the end of parking lot (almost the the back of Wal-Mart and you'll see Re-Planet small booth.

<Resp>None< /Resp><Review>I’ve lived in a few different states and Dr. Duenas is my favorite chiropractor I’ve seen throughout the years. He cares about his patients and is willing to go the extra mile to teach people how they can help themselves. If you get the chance, take one of his trigger point classes, where you can really learn to care for your body and resolve some issues on your own. I used to go for adjustments much more regularly, but I’ve gotten to a point where I don’t need to go as frequently.

His staff is incredible, and I highly recommend Cynthia if you are in need of a massage. She knows all the tricks to help relieve pain and release problem areas, not to mention she’s just the sweetest.<//Review>< Name>

I started coming here when I was about 20 weeks pregnant because I started having lower back pain. I’m so thankful I found Performance Chiroptactic because Dr. Duenas provided me with so much relief! He does great adjustment and also teaches you what’s going on in the body and things you can do at home. It’s obvious he loves his job and truly cares about his patients. The massage therapist, Cynthia, is amazing! She did several prenatal massages during my pregnancy. They helped so much.< /review>

<review>I was in constant pain for over 2 weeks and would wake up in tears every night. The pain and ache I felt on my shoulder, neck and back was radiating down to my elbow. I was unable to use my left arm or move my neck. I came to Dr. Duenas and he recommended Fascial treatment. During my treatment he explained everything in great detail and made sure I was doing okay throughout the treatment. After the treatment I felt instant relief and was able to move my neck. As the days went by I felt great, it was like I was never in pain. Here I am a few weeks later and I haven't had any pain or aches come back nor linger. Fascial treatment is the best treatment I have received and I truly recommend it. Dr. Duenas is the Best Chiropractor I have been seen and his office staff Cynthia is always very pleasant and helpful. I highly recommend Performance Chiropractic to anyone looking for a Chiropractor.<//review><Date>1618289770421</Date><rating>5<//rating>< response>

I have been going to see Erin Hamon for almost 2 years now to receive my monthly massages.  I can honestly say that going to see her monthly has significantly impacted my life for the better.  My headaches have decreased and I feel overall better.  She is friendly, courteous, professional, respectful, and gives the best massages ever!!  I highly recommend going to see Erin for a massage!!!<//Review>

Went to get a personal massage for my bad back and was very happy with the results. The woman Corina did an amazing job and I left the session feeling much better than when I arrived. My back is still in less pain and I will be going back to her again! Thank you!</Text>

<review>We love Dr D. He has been very patient with me and all my questions. He goes above and beyond to help you find the issues and understand how to take care of them. He is more than just a chiropractor. My kids are on the very affordable kids plan and love him. Jessica does my massages and she's great. It's amazing the strength that comes out of such a sweet and petite person. I've been to several chiropractors that have been good but this one has been a great fit for our family. Check them out!!!! You'd be amazed at how much your spine controls your health.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< GmapID>

<review>I have been a patient of Dr. D's for seven years or maybe even longer. I followed him through multiple offices. He has very personal care for his patients. He uses different techniques and approaches depending on exactly what is wrong. The office staff is great. Jessica is very personable, she is just wonderful. Great customer service. Jessica remembers you and you can pick up the same conversation from where you left off from your previous discussions. Really great experience.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Date>

All employees conduct their selves very professional and respectful.
The fact that Spanish is spoken makes it easier for some of us to communicate with staff members.< /text>

<review>Dr Rick was recommended by my therapyst. I had issues with my spine and my elbows.

Dr. Rick discovered I had other issues besides the normal adjustments and recommended I see an orthopaedist. His diagnosis was correct. He could have just continued with the adjustments but my well being was his concern not his pockets. I am happy to say that I no longer have any issues with my elbows and he has rid me of back pain. I can now golf and exercise without discomfort.

His staff is courteous, facility is immaculate, and his concerns are for his patients health.
His professionalism reflects credit upon his self and his establishment. I have recommended him to all my friends and will continue this practice in the future.

My thanks to Dr. Rick, Jessica and Staff!!!

<Review>I scheduled 3 full body massages on 07/25/2015 with Cynthia for myself and 2 other friends. We were very pleased with her promptness, her professionalism and her attention to detail. She asks you about the pressure throughout the massage to assure the pressure is sufficient. I will be back. Thank you Cynthia.<//Review>< pics>

<review>I've been going to Dr D on and off for close to 5 years now and I can honestly say that he takes the time to listen to my concerns and thoroughly educates me on why I have pain, how it gets aggravated, and what I can do to alleviate it. I never feel as if I am getting the same treatment as anyone else. Today, I did the foam rolling class to learn how to relieve my own trigger points. It hurts so good!! I walk out feeling refreshed. I always highly recommend Performance Chiropractic to all of my friends and family.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>I wish I would have listened to my coach and came in a lot sooner. I have been here twice to get worked on and will continue to do so. I am in and out in a timely manner, the staff especially Jessica are friendly and welcoming, and answer questions efficiently. Dr Rick Dueñas explained everything in a way that was easy for me to understand. He spent time with me during my initial consultation, and they were able to see me the same day to get worked on. I feel 10xs better since going in for my adjustments.<//Review>< Pictures>

I have been seeing Jessica the Licensed Massage Therapist at Performance Chiropractic for the past several months. I have a very physical job and had been experiencing quite a bit of soreness and pain in my legs and back, she has helped me immensely. I always walk out of the office feeling 100x better than when I walked in. I know that the sport massages have helped me to prevent any injuries and to succeed at my job. I would strongly recommend Jessica to anyone.<//Text>

Jenny is my favorite Masseuse! She finds knots I didn't know I had so when I leave I feel so much relief. I carry my stress in my neck and shoulders and I leave feeling so relaxed and ready to take on the world. Jenny listens to what I want/need and does exactly that. When I tell her it hurts, she keeps at it, knowing that I need it and when I tell her it's too much she backs off a bit. Always get my money's worth with Jenny. Thank you soooooo much!<//text>

I look for a calm, caring, and efficient environment in any of my medical care, they definitely deliver. Thank you Dr. Duenas and Jessica. I always look forward to my visits.</review>< username>

I was referred to Dr. Duenas after an accident, I had really bad back pain and honestly thought I was going to have to live like this forever. I felt very welcome from day one in his office. He has the best staff!! They were very friendly and I received nothing but the BEST service and treatment!!! They have definitely helped me so much, my pain has been minimized and I will definitely be back for monthly adjustments, I wouldn't go anywhere else! They made me feel like family, and I will be referring my friends and family to this office! Thank you Dr. Duenas and Jessica for helping me out! You guys are awesome!!< /review>

Excellence at its best!
I have been seeing Dr. Duenas for over a year now and am extremely pleased with his expertise as well as the staff! They are always welcoming and provide excellent service, not too mention i always leave their office feeling 100% better than when i came in. I used to visit his office twice a week to relieve my pain and now i only go 1 time a week and/or as needed. I also have taken his foam rolling class to help work out my pain at home which has made a tremendous difference in my pain levels! They have massages, which are very reasonably priced and are better than at a day spa in my opinion. I would (and have) highly recommend Performance Chiropractic to anyone needing pain relief! Thanks Dr. Duenas and staff, you guys are the best!<//text>

<Text>You are in *very* good hands with "Dr. D" and Jessica. I go in with a cane to walk, and leave without needing it. I love the heat and the roller table. He accommodates whatever disabilities I may have that day and adjusts without hurting me.

Dr Duenas:  Great skill, explains well, experience, prompt--doesn't make me wait forever to see me either when I am needing an appointment or in the office, helpful in any way he can, generous, professional, warm hands (freezing hands I've had, and that's not helpful when you need an adjustment), and humorous.

Jessica:  Cheery personality, fun, remembers my name/background, great conversationalist, EXCELLENT massage therapist!, funny, thorough, professional, perceptive, down-to-earth, generous, heart-centered, thoughtful, did I say EXCELLENT massage therapist? oh yes, she's the best...lol.

I've had back issues since 1991. I've seen a dozen chiropractors all over (CA, Alaska, Virginia). Some have helped, some have hurt, some have REALLY hurt! Dr. Duenas is the FIRST and only to stretch and massage my neck after an adjustment so I didn't have a throbbing headache when I leave. That's huge. I've never let anyone do my neck because of how it feels torqued and hurts afterward--except him.

I always look forward to going in to see them. I've known them since 2010. They make a great professional team and I am so happy to see their success and growth.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c25a59e7c45a7d:0x14d73f533cbf1d06< /gmap_id></record>

I strongly recommend Dr. Dueñas.   I started my chiropractic care with him 4 months ago since I could barely walk because of my lower back problems.  I was limited in what I was able to do.  Most importantly I was unable to play with my nieces and nephews without any pain.  Since I started going to Dr. Dueñas I immediately felt very comfortable and started getting educated in how I can help myself and my body.  He is very understanding and caring for his patients.  He has amazing staff that will always make you feel at home.  Driving from San Fernando every week was not an issue since I knew he was helping me be pain free.  Not only do I feel 100 times better from my back but I also became and exercise addict.  I'm able to do my normal activities with no pain and most importantly no medication.  I will always recommend Dr. Dueñas to all my friends.</Text>

Wonderful plaza, wonderful people. We can not thank the people enough for allowing us to stay in their parking lot after the Thomas fire and showing us concern & caring. Especially, the gentleman who owns the best deli anywhere: with wonderful, fresh, and tasty meats & sandwiches.< /Text>

I was only able to shop at the supermarket Von's, while visiting.  It was nice that I was able to use my Safeway rewards card for their sales ads, as well as their digital ads.  The cashier's were pleasant.  There were a variety of other stores, that I did not get the opportunity to shop at.< /Text>

I am a disabled senior and would buy MUCH more if the store would provide more shopping carts.  I can't carry multiple items in a hand basket.  I know carts

cost money but how can you operate a store without them?  If there are one or two someone else has them.</Text>

They sure need to update that parking lot. More lights outside the store fronts, you can hardly see people getting ready to cross the street to go the their cars. There are curves that do not need to be there. Oh and cvs ?? The sign foe that store has got to go ! Reads like this CVS Y MAS !! WHY?  No other CVS store reads like that ! In any town any place. Maybe it don't bother anyone else but me.< /Review>
