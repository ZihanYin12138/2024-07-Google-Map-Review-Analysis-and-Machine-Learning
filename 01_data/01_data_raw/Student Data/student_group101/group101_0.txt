Thanks. -Stacy'}</resp><name>90stateofmind< /name><review>Hello, it all started with I rented a car on Tuesday morning around 7:30, I didn’t brother checking the car because I was I a rush and had to be at work soon.  BIG MISTAKE. After work around 7 I smelled a strong order coming from the back I was shocked, disgusted and disappointed to see dried VOMIT in the back seat so I immediately called the store which was closed then processed to call the 1800 number to inform them about the situation they only offered to return it to the airport which I couldnt due to the fact it was late and I had 2 half hr drive so unfortunately I managed to drive smell of vomit.12/28 This morning while I was trying to return I spoke to Brice the manger and told him I either need my entire refund back and I’m not refilling up the gas or I need to keep the car until the main manger comes and will figure it out from there, he then process to take the keys and drive off with the car with my belonging still in the car. I didn’t know what else to do so i call the police when they arrived he stated he when to go fill up the gas and that I would be charged for the gas when clearly I didn’t want to return the car unless I was being refunded.. He is a bad manger and even worse human , you guys where clearly in the wrong and he made the situation worse and made me feel uncomfortable acting as if I was the bad guy the whole time.  It’s not only a safely hazard but just gross how he could think it’s acceptable. From the vomit to the car to the customer service I don’t know which one is worse. I would like my full refund and not to be charged gas for the rental if anything I need an apologize from both Brice and the main manger.
12/30 Received a call from Charlie the manger at the store instead of helping out once again he tried to cover up his tracks stating he took the car home the night before there no way there can be vomit and he proceeded to charge me for the rental except for the gas it’s not until I called back asking for my receipt he stated that I’ll get my full refund after he charged me because he doesn’t want this to go to corporate. Sorry this facility deserves a new manger< /review>< GmapID>

My Experience with this enterprise was really great. They gave me a very neat and clean car. Catherine was very polite and she made sure that we get a great service. Also they picked me and dropped with ease. I would definitely like to rent here going forward. Thanks for your good service.< /review>

I rented twice with Enterprise Rental on Claremont, San Mateo, Ca. I was super impressed with Marcio and Charlie professionalism, warmth and friendliness. They treated me and each customer that hd come in before me with care and provided undivided attention.
This is the reason why I chose to return to this location vs. SF airport and Hillsdale location! They went out of their way to a specific car (Ford Hybrid Fusion) and they brought it over! I was so happy and feel super confident of returning to them for future rentals especially since they are also part of National Rental Car! Thank you Marcio and Charlie for your exemplary service!<//text>

The location is small, and the lot is a bit tight. However, the service was fast, efficient, and very friendly. I had the opportunity to work with both local agents, who unfortunately I can't remember their names. But, they both provided me the top of the line service I have come to expect from Enterprise.<//text>

The staff here are great, professional, and very helpful best customer service in the area. The reason I gave it a 4 not 5 is the quality of the cars. They are clean and everything but every time I get a new one it drives horribly. This could be the make of the cars being low end.</review>

I was told, and observed that this organization has an unprofessional and antagonistic individual on their staff. Let me help you, get better. You get one gold star for boldness and insolence. In good faith.< /Review>

guards at Mars Petcare at  1901 California in Redlands, CA finish their lunch and make drivers wait till they are done.

guess the lunch break is 30 minutes to an hour depending on the guards

there's 2 guards, they should take turns  helping drivers, instead we get delayed leaving this customer which causes us more additional problems finding safe parking and the L.A. area parking shortage is made worse because we're wasting our 14 and truck parking is filling up while we're unnecessarily waiting for the guards to finish their lunch<//text>

I worked with them for only a short while and here's why. When I first interviewed I was told the starting pay was $15/ hr. The day I went to the classes they said the pay was $14.50. I told myself, "ok, not a big deal." The day of orientation they instructor told us we'd start getting pay the $14.50 only after the 90 day probation period was up. After 120 day I saw no change in pay, so I contacted the district manager who of course couldn't be reach immediately.  After a few day he called me back. He said to me, "Whoever told you that shouldn't have. Thats not how things work with the company." I asked him if there was nothing he could do because I had given up a job that was already paying me $14.50, but I felt that with this company there was room for growth. Suffice it to say I didn't hear from him for another few days. To which he says that there was a different site he could transfer me to, with the dollar more pay. However, this new location was a commute, I'd be where I started. I got to work and found a new job. As soon as I got hired else where I left. In my anger though, I didn't give proper notice. Some months have passed and as times are hard right now I'm applying to other jobs, the old manager I worked under, decides to tell the new hiring manager that I caused many issues while with them. But not once was I ever later, I'd stay over my shift until my relief decided to show. I didn't call out. I was a model employee. While I admit my exit was not the most gracious I can own up to it. Them, however, remain unprofessional, shady, and apparent lairs.
I would not trust them for one. But also get everything in writing.< /text>

They ask how far your willing to travel and then promptly disregard your answer. Uniform pants must be hemmed at your cost. Pay is on average a buck and quarter above minimum wage. It feels like they just need bodies to be on site. So far very little energy has been invested with the employees. Will update with more feedback after first paycheck. Been in this game for a decade and so far this company has all the hallmarks of a less than desirable company to work for. But time will tell...<//text>

<Review>It's a job. For the most part, in my experience, they just need bodies. They talk a lot about communication, but they are very bad at it. It's probably because they have a lot of accounts and I can see how they are busy, but you need to badger your managers for a response. I was patient, I would wait a few weeks before sending another email or a week before calling back depending on the issue, but they take long to get back to you even for simple matters. Also the receptionist that worked there when I did was rude.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80c335650399d68f:0xac5a5576f2a5a988</gmapID></record>

<resp>None</resp><Review>This company is garbage they should be thrown in the trash. My question is how do a company like this stay in business so long without anyone knowing how crooked they are? The answer is they know-how to cover their tracks very well. They know how to hide their dirt. I wouldn't work for them again if they paid me 50 dollars an hour nor would I refer my worst enemy to work for this company. It's like giving somebody a death sentence. If you are reading this don't do it. I mean work here. They hate you.< /Review>< pictures>

I have been with Securitas for almost three years and they are a great company. I'm currently an Armed Security Officer the pay is great. I also get paid for my lunch since I'm unable to leave for lunch.

There are a lot of opportunity at Securitas after three months working with the company I was given the opportunity for an armed post. There was an interview and a few test. I was able to past the test and had a great interview I received the post. I was award officer of the month back in August 2013.

The managers and staff at the Ontario Location are very helpful and they care about their employees. They are very organize and are always on the game. This company has great clients and good posts. I will recommend anyone who is looking for a great security company to start there security career.< /Review>

<Text>If you're looking for an employer that doesn't return phone calls or emails, look no further. Ask lots of questions about posts, because they won't bother with telling you specifics. If you get hired, bring clothes hangers to your orientation, because they'll give you a wastebasket liner to take your uniforms and stuff home in. Feel valued!  ADDITION: After 2.5 years, they have started sending me certified letters asking if I still work for them. The letters have no return address, no email address and no phone number. Indescribably awful organization.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

She threatened us with blasting the ac because we were tired, then threatened saying she'll take our phones. She had a real snappy attitude and she knew we couldn't say much about it because she kept threatening to send us home. All of this training for such low pay is plain ridiculous.

Currently a guard here

Great job to get your card and bounce after something better comes up.

Was laid off and put back to the same post 3 times, Was not paid for working thanksgiving and the company still owes me 160$ for shorting me on 2 checks. Even after my branch manager confirmed the issue, she was not very helpful and tended to try to shoo me with the "Let me take care of it, ill call you back in 20 minutes" deal

I cant speak for the entire company but the Ontario branch seems very unprofessional for the most part.

TLDR; Get your card and find something new, or expect to encounter all kinds of unnecessary stress

Edit: Also OSHA has shown up multiple times to the Proctor & Gamble location in Moreno Valley. They were citing for a lack of water, blocked walkways, illegal scheduling, and fire hazards.</Text>

<Text>I went in and had my interview and was told by Megan in the Temecula office that they had a post for me. She said it was my near my home. I was called by a supervisor named Leo from the Ontario office saying that I requested a transfer. I never did that nor was I told that I had to do that. I told him I never transferred at all. They said they had to do that in order for me to work at the Ontario office. Then they said it was mandatory that I do two days of training and a day of orientation. They will call me in a couple of days to let me know when I can go in.  I haven’t heard anything at all and I have emailed and called all of the people that I have dealt with too. I do not get a response from Megan or anyone in the Ontario office. Their communication is horrible. They tell me that I have a job and I have been waiting for three weeks now. I do not recommend this company at all. They really need to work on their communication and attitudes. I do not understand how these places stay in business when they treat people this way and get their hopes up for nothing.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

They have there employees make falls accusations of falls incident reports. They don't care about employees or care at all.they need to do an investigation on there managers for being racist and homophobic. Don't work there work for some one who cares about your wages and input and sexuality.< /Text>

<Text>They discriminated me for my background and I don’t even have any misdemeanor or felonies. So I don’t understand why they didn’t hire me. They said we will contact you in 7 days and I got no answer. Securitas you are a joke And should be reported for discrimination< /Text>< Date>

<Text>Worst communication skills ive ever seen . They will place you where ever benefits them.  I tired to get moved from a site they had me at for only saturday and sunday so i can switch to a full time post and my branch manager oscar told me i couldnt he had to first find someone to cover my position.. After waiting for a month i asked him again to remove me from the site he then said i had to put a two week notice to get moved from my site.  On top of that he does not return calls until days latter if that.  This place is one of the worst security place i worked for.</Text>< Pics>

This place is not that good the employees don't care about the guards.  Hassle for breaks and lunches and leads and post commander have free reign over there employees and buid click with no order but if you make them happy.  And I have only worked here for 3 months.  They need to have someone go under cover at their post and office and they could see that this stuff is not hype or disgruntle employees. I kid you not</review>

very bad service since they let some people who work in their own business use all the dryers and do not let others dry their clothes once they have finished their drying cycle they do not remove their clothes the day they were standing  12 dryers only with their clothes</Text>

I really like this laundry place but still the two  couples  Wouldn’t let me use the restroom there was no  sign of our order  But when I got there he put the sing on n I asked I used the restroom he said no he have to call  The Plumber they was really nice but when  kept going and going  They  treat me like nothing but it’s ok I still come n do my laundry tho but the Two  couples  Are really Rude<//text>

(Translated by Google) Very good service in the afternoon! Mostly I go in the afternoon the gentlemen keep very clean and are very friendly. In the morning I almost don't like to go, there is not very good service in the morning. But from then on everything is fine!

Muy buen servicio en la tarde! Mayormente que voy en la tarde los señores mantienen muy limpio y son muy amables. En la mañana casi no me gusta ir, no hay muy buen servicio en la mañana. Pero de ahí en más todo muy bien!</text>

Ok. As an ex bartender...this place is the best. A bartender that cares more about who is driving home then anything else is a A++++ place to me. New to area. Nice people. But again, Roxanne who was the bartender wouldn't serve until she knew who was driving home which was amazing! Ordered Uber and she said car is fine for night but friends came to drive us home. Again, any place that cares less about serving more drinks and more about the people is an amazing place to me!! Tip well!! They care about people 100%!!!</Review>

P.S. Also tried take out, great packaging and food holds up well!

P.S.P.S. Very friendly and good service!</Review></record>

Excellent food and service. We had the sausage plate and the chicken paprikash and both were delicious. The sausages were some of the most flavorful that I've had in the U.S.
The owner was very attentive and accommodating. We'll definitely be back!</text>

This place is close to 24th St Mission bart. Not too busy on a Saturday afternoon. We ordered mix of 2 sausages (polish kielbasa & Hungarian sweet) with mashed potato and gravy. We had Das boot as well(good for 2 or 3 people) Food was good but I wish they had a dinner roll for the sausage.</review>

Remind us of Budapest. Neither of the two pork goulash dishes was salty. The gnocchi was done al dente so they were great for slurping up the sauces. Not big portions. Apfelstrudel was excellent (not too sweet) with fresh whipped cream and huge. Service was fast and friendly. Cash only.< /Review>

Hungarian food, an area in which I'm an expert. Warm, homey atmosphere; food quite solid. Maybe not as good as Mama used to make, but close<//review>

My friends and I were among the first customers to eat here when they first opened. They have always given first rate service. They may take a little time to get to things when they are busy as they are a small restaurant, but that is part of the intimate setting. It's like going to a friend or relatives house for dinner. They go the extra mile to make sure everything is just right. The menu is a little basic, but what they do they do well. I always look forward to going back.</review>

<Text>*** In Short ***

Flavorful food that falls a bit short otherwise.

*** In Depth ***

After asking friends for suggestions about places that were similar in style to some Russian cuisine I've enjoyed on previous visits to Seattle, Paprika was one of several suggested to me, and certainly the easiest to get to of the numerous options, with the others being on the other end of the city. So, along I came, with a friend, getting their:

* Paprika Goulash - Great, great flavor overall (mostly from the sauce), but the gnocchi was a bit too doughy and lacking in firmness, while the pork itself was too dry for my tastes (albeit tender).

* Mixed Sausage Plate - A combo plate with the Polish kielbasa, and one other sausage I can't recall: German spice? Hungarian Sweet? I can't imagine I knowingly ordered the last one, but... read on. So, this combo plate had some good flavor going on too, helped along with the aforementioned sauce in place of traditional gravy for the mashed potatoes. Kielbasa is always quite tasty, but the other one I ordered was unexpectedly sweet, and while not bad, is not a particular one of the taste senses I enjoy when eating sausage (thus, the earlier doubt).

So, the food is by no means BAD. But, given the other gastropubs in the city that I've enjoyed far more, I can't really see myself coming back. Three stars normally, but 2.5 for this reason.

***Accessibility Info***

Venue - A bit on the smaller side, with tables consisting mostly (or entirely?) of two-tops. While a good majority of them are accessible, some are arranged in such a way that they may be inaccessible if you were sitting back to back with someone else.

Bathroom - Didn't try.< /Text>< Pics>

We ordered pork goulash and Chicken Paprika -- both are great. The meat was cooked perfectly and just the right amount of spices in the stew. Freshly made bread was a nice addition to the whole thing. Not too many options in the menu -- but whatever is there, they are perfect.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<date>1460608006152< /date><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response><review>I'm a little surprised by the enthusiasm in other reviews.

I had the goulash, and while the sauce was rich and flavorful, the pork itself had clearly been stewed past its time.  I can live with dry pork, especially when a sauce is this rich and thick, but I can't really do the (frozen?) gnocchi they're serving... especially not at $26/entree.

My cousin barely touched her plate of vegan sausage and mashed potatoes.  Yeah, her fault on the vegan sausage thing, but the potatoes were eerily reminiscent of my elementary school cafeteria.  My cousin will eat *any* plate of mashed potatoes... but not these.

I don't get any great joy out of bashing Paprika, but it just wasn't very good, particularly at these prices.  I'm pretty sure they could be doing better..< /review>< user_id>

<Review>This place is a hidden gem for great Eastern European fare. While the location and decor help to keep its unassuming presence, the flavors are anything but that as the name sake shines through each dish. Do yourself a favor and give this place a shot, but be sure to bring cash as it's cash only.< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>Solid 4.5 stars for this unassuming place in Mission. We weren't finding anything open on Xmas eve, but yelp showed Paprika had tables available so we took a chance and went. Cosy place, serving some honest to good East European and German fare, with a great beer and wine list (they had wine from Georgia which I couldn't try cos I already got some amazing dark German beer). Got the Paprika goulash, which was some of the best I've had in the states, brother got the Hungarian sweet sausage and the German spice sausage, both of which were excellent. The Apfelstrudel was on point too. Definitely worth a stop especially when the weather was cold and rainy as it was yesterday!<//review>< Pictures>

The food was top notch, just like Mom used to make. I ain't kidding. The owners were so polite and appreciative of our appetite, again like home. Das boot, if you drink beer is a must..

<Review>Pricey? Well, yes. But this establishment fills a void in a New Age way. Gnocchi with goulash??? Sounds odd, but Bohemian Dumplings and such that usually seems to accompany goulash here in the New World are really not that different from gnocchi.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Very delicious Czech food, with a good beer selection. I love their sausages and their goulash. Last time I was there, they were cash only, though - which is odd for a place where you usually end up spending $40ish for two people, so I don't go there often. But it is very good food.< /Text>

<Review>A really nice German/Polish/European style place with great sausage-based meals and beer to go with it. I really liked the look of the place, with low key wooden tables and an overall appropriate feel, and could not help but revert to my pre-vegetarian days when looking at the menu. The service was quite fast and the place was fairly quiet, allowing me and my friends to have a good time talking. Definitely recommended.</Review>< pictures>

The waiter is an racist.  Swearing at me and rudest experience I ever had.

Come on America got to be better this.

Germans should learn to respect other after so long after Second World War.<//Review>

<review>We stumbled upon this spot, and I'm so happy for it! The space is elegant, but also cozy and inviting. Service was friendly and professional, and we were seated right away.
The food transported me back to my childhood trips to Austria and Bavaria, with a distinct Eastern European touch.
The cheese plate and German spicy sausage were delicious, and a good portion size for starters (ok, the cheese plate might have been a bit large, but can you really ever have too much cheese?).
There is a limited selection for entrees, but we knew that going in, having looked at the menu posted outside. That said, even though the goulash and the paprikash looked the same, they tasted quite distinct, and both delicious!

10/10, do recommend.< /review>< Response>

We went on our weekly jaunt out to a new San Francisco restaurant, this week's adventure was Paprika.

Dinner was wonderful The food was great. Service was so friendly. The beers we drank were new to us and fantastic.

We ate and drank:
Weihenstephan: unfiltered hefe
Staropramen Dark: Crisp, light, rich beer
SMALL PLATE - GERMAN SPICY SAUSAGE: the sausage was so good, just the perfect amount of spicy
CHICKEN PAPRIKASH: sweet, savory, delicious
SZEGED GOULASH: my favorite, tangy, sour, rich, and awesome
HOMEMADE APPLE STRUDEL: The dessert was delicious, it did not need the chocolate and strawberry drizzle, and would have been perfect simply served with whipped cream

We'll definitely be back. The food was wonderful and a breath of fresh air on the SF restaurant scene. The prices were just right.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Perhaps one of the few places where a Czech owner drew Czech beer and brews Central European dishes. Just a pity that the Yanks are interested in dumplings, because goulash with six ..... that would be.
But the owner is a super guy and talks well with him, although only occasionally, because he has to attend to other guests.
For me ..... like in school ..... number one with 🌟

(Original)
Možná jedno z mála míst, kde český majitel čepuje české pivo a vaří tady středoevropská jídla. Jen škoda, že amíci memají zájrm o knedlíky, protože gulášek se šesti..... to by bylo.
Ale majitel je super chlap a dobře se s ním pokecá, i když jen chvílemi, protože se musí věnovat i ostatním hostům.
Za mě..... jako ve škole..... jednička s 🌟< /text>

< Review>
I can't say enough good things about Hollywood Cat and Dog Hospital. I brought my kittens here after having a bad experience at another vet, and this clinic was just incredible. The staff and vet techs are attentive, friendly, thorough, and efficient, and the vet here is extremely experienced, kind, thoughtful, and detailed. He conducted thorough exams with both kittens, who were uncharacteristically calm with him, and answered all of my questions and concerns in detail, taking the time to make sure I was clear on their treatment plan. The rates are affordable ($60 for a wellness exam per animal), and the people here genuinely showed care and concern for my pets. Absolutely recommend.< /Review>

<rating>5</rating><review>HCDH is the best!  Recently I needed a emergency hospital for my dog.
Unfortunately, they were booked up at the time and gave me other references to go to.  After two emergency hospitals my dog was still not well.  HCDH was willing to look at my X-rays to see if they saw anything different.  It was so kind of them to take their time to look to see if any of the x-rays showed any additional problems that were not caught by the other hospitals.  Dog is now fine.
This is my main dog hospital and they are always very nice, helpful, good with dogs (and I am sure cats as well).  I do recommend them to anyone with an animal.< /review>< pics>

My dog makes vet visits difficult.  He stresses around other dogs and he stresses at the vet, and the combination of the two is incredibly problematic when he needs a check-up.  This means the only way to get anything done at the vet is to muzzle him and fight his thrashing until he can be sedated.

Fortunately, the folks at Hollywood Cat and Dog Hospital are very understanding and are excellent at dealing with difficult pets.  It took them quite a bit of extra work, but they took great care of my dog and managed to give him a full check-up and a teeth cleaning.  The vet and vet techs were wonderful to work with, and never made me feel bad for the problems my dog was causing (this has not been my experience at other vets, and it was remarkably refreshing).  I feel like the staff really cares about my dog's well-being and are happy to work with him, despite his difficulties.

Thank you, Hollywood Cat and Dog Hospital!  You've earned a customer for life.</text>

We are thrilled to have met Dr. Girgis and joined the Hollywood Cat and Dog Hospital community! Our dog Whiskey loved Dr. Girgis, and we really appreciated his guidance and patience in answering all the questions we had about our new addition to the family. Thank-you also to the hospital for offering a free initial examination to recently adopted shelter pets via the Southern California Veterinary Medical Association. When a vet is going out of their way to help improve the health and wellbeing of shelter animals, you know they're great people. We're so pleased Whiskey is in such kind hands.<//Text>

Your place should be shut down. I took my cat in to be neutered two weeks ago. Then I get a phone call that his blood work was concerning and it could be anything from cancer to nothing at all. What kind of a range is that?!? Now my cat has mange. His hair is falling out and he can’t stop itching. Someone should report you for your horrible work and taking advantage of people. What is wrong with you people?!?</text>

So far so good! Great customer service. Taking my dog in on Saturday for teeth cleaning and possible extractions. They have been very responsive and able to get my 14.5 year old son into their schedule. My dog I have owned since he was 5 weeks so I am trusting that my healthy 14 year old Chihuahua will be in good hands as they put my baby under anesthesia. I will update as this happens. Great customer service!< /text>

I have been taking my buddy Baxter to Dr. Girgis for almost a decade. He is compassionate, kind, professional and friendly. He has taken great care of Baxter and the office manager, Michelle is absolutely wonderful. She is so helpful, kind and takes the time to listen. The team truly cares and the place is always clean. They are the most affordable vet I have visited in NY and LA. I recently had a scare with Baxter and took him to MASH where they failed to insert a catheter for his obvious urinary blockage so I brought him in to Dr. Girgis and he immediately relieved his blockage and pain. Baxter ended up needing two emergency life saving surgeries two weeks ago and we thank God Dr. Girgis helped us find our emergency hospital True Care for Pets, because they saved his life.< /Text>

When I arrived on time she told me to wait with the dog outside in the rain and on top of that she told me to fill out paperwork outside standing with a big dog like it's nothing.
When I told her no acceptable she rolled her eyes at me like it was my fault.
Was supposed to be the first visit going to be last.
Not recommend during this time as they are not organized or ready.< /Text>< Rate>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>If I could give this clinic minus 5 starts I would! They almost killed my dog!! I went there with a bad case of maggots and the laziest and most careless vet (I cannot recall his name but he is tall, thin, in his 60s, with glasses and thick accent) told me to take my dog to pet wash, cut his hair and come back in a week so he could treat the infection in the skin. So we went to pet wash and they refused to take my dog because maggots need to be treated first BY THE VET! I was so mad!! I called a different clinic and they asked me to bring her ASAP as that is considered a medical emergency. Thank God it was a decent clinic that care for pets. They shaved her hair, treated the wounds and hospitalized her to treat the maggots. She is back home now and recovering. If we would have waited 1 week like that careless individual said my dog WOULD BE DEAD by now. Careless!! Money hungry!! If you love your pet DO NOT take it there!!!<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_xWzvCkF-mmHMzFEmvIMs043q4irUQoGHCDGQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics></record>

<pictures>None</pictures><Review>I have cats and dogs and have gone to this vet for 13 years, I used to live close but now I live a half hour away and I still only go here. Dr Girgis saved my dog's life because of what a talented vet and diagnostician he is (he caught her Addisonian Crisis in time to treat it). He is a very seasoned vet with a gentle hand and demeanor, and a supportive staff. He is great about including you in your pet's care/cure and respecting your voice when it comes to knowing your own animal and what works best for them. I never feel rushed and he will always try to answer your questions, which means if it is busy you may have to wait a bit but it's worth it to be in good hands.< /Review></record>

Dr. Girgis is one of the most kind doctors out there. I've been going here since before he owned it in 1995. His staff is the best. From Michelle at the front desk to the vet techs Andy and Ramon. If you have an emergency they get yo in right away.  And the prices....you cannot beat them. Top quality care and reasonable prices for your furbaby. I'd give this place 10 stars if I could.< /review>

Extremely helpful, warm, and considerate. I was able to come see the doctor in an emergency for my cat the very same day. I particularly liked how the doctor took his time to ask all sorts of questions about my cat's habits. I didn't feel rushed. When you have an older cat on which you need to keep a close eye to anticipate future problems, this is what I needed. Thank you!< /review>

<Review>My dog was feeling ill and I needed to take him to a vet, tried a few places and no one had any appointments available or would charge over $80 take my dog in the emergency. Hollywood Cat & Dog hospital was able to take me in without an appointment and charged me almost half the cost of the other places. They were able to check out my dog and give him proper medicine and he was feeling mutch better the following day. Thank you! Will definitely be coming.< /Review>< user>

I discovered Hollywood Cat and Dog by circumstance since I used to live nearby - I now feel so lucky that I found them! From routine visits to urgent issues, Dr. Girgis and his incredible staff have always been there to keep my family happy and healthy. Dr. Girgis is always patient and willing to to have a conversation with me about my pet's health and possible treatment options. He has been amazing with helping us narrow down my dog's allergies and sensitive skin, and eventually finding the right diet/treatment for her - while also helping with so many other issues like UTIs, dental health, and more. The staff here are always so friendly and helpful, and they take a genuine interest in you and your pet/s. The entire team is a delight to interact with, making appointments and calling with random medical questions is always a breeze. Even though I've recently moved to Pasadena, I still take my pets to Hollywood Cat and Dog for everything veterinary related! I really can't imagine taking them anywhere else. Thank you Dr. Girgis and team for everything!</text>< Pictures>

<Text>Dr. Girgis is a passionate veterinarian, his staff are just as sociable and professional. This is the pet clinic to go to on the west side. They did a wonderful multiple tumor removal and followup care for one of my cats who is 18 years old, and most definitely prolonged her life. Deliver your ailing best friends into their reliable hands.< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>I have been a client at Hollywood cat and dog Hospital since 2002.
I am amazed of how always they change my tears and fears into a smile and happiness.
I am writing this review now because this time I thought It's the end of my dog's life. But after a four hours critical surgery, My dog(10 years old) now is jumbing like a puppy.

I always run to them when it's a life or death case because I know how professional and honest they are. Specially when it comes to money.  Usually other hospitals take advantage of an emergency situation.

So, I would love to thank the amazing smart Dr .
Also a big thanks for the Amazing Caring Staff.</Text><Response>None<//Response>< Time>

<Review>Just the absolute worst. I took my cat there for three years, and always, the service & care were the pits. I went because they were close. THEN--two things happened. FIRST, my neighbor died and left behind his black cat in a leg cast. In an effort to adopt it & make sure it received the right care, we went to HCaDH and asked if they could tell us whether the cat had indeed received treatment from their facility. They showed zero sympathy, and refused to 'release records' (keep in mind we weren't asking them to) and wouldn't even tell us IF they were the vet who had put on the cast. They were cold, insensitive, and essentially abandoned the cat to the fates. Then--SECOND--I moved a few months later, and called to ask if they could fax my own cat's records to a new vet. Surprise-surprise, the only record they had for my cat dated back to 2009--they hadn't updated his records (or kept any?) for YEARS. Made me wonder why they weren't 'releasing records' for my neighbor's cat--because they don't keep any?!<//Review>< Pictures>

I have always had excellent service at Hollywood Cat and Dog.  There is usually never a long wait, and Doctor Girgis is a very nice man.  The staff are knowlegable, pleasant and very efficient.  The premises is clean and tidy and the prices are very fair.  I would highly reccomend this Vet to any of my friends and family.  They have looked after my dog since he was a puppy and have had no problems.</review>

<text>I've been going here since 1996. They have a very caring and friendly staff. My cat was on his deathbed and Dr. Girgis diagnosed a rare disease and saved his life. My neighbor's dog had a knee operation there. He was walking on 3 legs. It took about 5 months to heal fully, but now it's 3 years later and he hasn't limped. I highly recommend.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<resp>None< /resp><text>I have been taking my animals to the Cat & Dog Hospital for years.  They have always been very caring and compassionate and charge less than a lot of other vets.  I highly recommend them based on my experience over the years.  Thank you for taking such great care of my cat Kizzy and my Angel of a dog, Kaya!  We all appreciate you!!!   ;)<//text><Name>Terri Herrington< /Name>< GmapID>

Dr. Girgis and his staff have been taking fine care of my cats for many years. He is very gentle and handles the animals well. Dr. Girgis also explains every little detail to you so you are aware of what is going on with your pet. I trust him completely!</Review>

I just adopted a dog and took her to Hollywood Cat and Dog Hospital for her shots.  They were nice and didn't make me wait too long.  Not sure how they are for a medical emergency, but they were nice enough on here vaccinations.< /Review>

<text>I brought my cat in after an attack, I mean right after. They gave me an $800 laundry list of stuff they wanted to do. Hook her up to an IV, sedate her, shave her, four part x-ray and antibiotics . ..  I said I couldn't afford that. So they pushed me on the antibiotics.

Four days later, I took her to another vet. And that Dr. did a one part X-ray and found nothing wrong with her. In fact, she said the antibiotics were totally unnecessary. My cat was gagging on them. That bill was under $200.

You can't trust anyone anymore. Never recommend it. In fact, the vet said they get a lot of their patients due to similar complaints.</text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>I took my doggie Lucy because of Flea problems. I asked the Veterinarian about NextGard but he ended giving me Comfortis. About half an hour later from the visit, I did research on both NextGard and Comfortis, I found out Comfortis does NOT have Heartworm Prevention and NextGard would of been a better choice. I called he Veterinarian and ask to change the prescription to NextGard instead. The receptionist told me they DO NOT Carry NextGard, if I want to get it, I had to go someplace else. I said I would return the Comfortis  and get my money back, The receptionist told me they WERE NOT giving me my money back, the only thing they could do was to credit my account for future visits. So, the veterinarian just sold me something he knew was not the best choice but wanted to sell me something any ways and just make money before prescribing NextGard which he can't make money because he does not sells it and still thinks that I want to come back for future visits??? If he had been an honest person he would of prescribed NextGuard even thought he does not sells it. He can keep the 3 month Comfortis medication he prescribed and my money. I WILL NEVER come back to a liar and greedy veterinarian. I should of believed the other bad review.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I LOVE Elena’s crepes. There’s a wide variety of both sweet and savory flavors and they’re all delicious. Elena herself is also lovely. I live in San Diego now but still drive up every once in a while for a treat, because they’re that good. I highly recommend!< /text>

Elena's French Crepe Cafe is the most incredible experience. Elena is so very kind. Even with covid she is pleasant and happy. The Nutella, sour cream, chocolate was heavenly. Perfect combination of flavors.<//text>

The butter used is just the perfect touch. Didn't get to photo the ham & cheese, but that was a favorite of ours. Of course, I love nutella, reminded me our trip to France and Belgium. The owners are the best! Friendly and really have a passion for their crepes! We have wanted to try it for so long, so glad we made it in today. We'll definitely be back!<//review>< time>

Elena's crepes is a quaint artsy fun spot located at the entrance of Oceansides artist alley. This is a decadent treat, I had the ham and cheese crepe and my Mother in law enjoyed her egg salad crepe. The crepes are delicate and light and scrumptious, almost sinful.
Elana and her husband Hassan have been serving up scrumptious crepes in Oceanside for four years. Their artwork is proudly displayed on the walls. You owe it to yourself, treat yourself to a crepe, you deserve it.</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXkSGf0awIo4vhTY-VbgjcCUDQXvN0Ipq-NZ52=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJPRw8dgbdNOuH9zYA1HDkK_dAIOZCLfVWIVjD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1mpfZJOyn9BfSrncDKHxXSQCvxUMMePgjI32I=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwX73ZU3Ii0SS2jnMIjVysB6T-NyRo5UyBsVzv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9VDRVB_L_jxPngwAEP3CYpkGLVQU2iyLW-xzs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4kcDjgivug5DiKT-TBj7DbHLDm_ikzJ0Uz-Ya=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGDjQom78h5Bu1CaKHq1WuCUoJOa6ros6GYMGG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpJDz9OLpt-7IpfiuXGJNHgZxO8B53uj4eHfcp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNI6BQXRUUCETARYDomqRKIjqDin42Qfn3YJgFR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMb5HpWK5a642TS4Y1AVmPn2zJrxuLw18bkvKln=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhra62owDRAF5LfWVKgOT0XbFNtzIF01IU83MO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80dc6e3725f59479:0x9bf13ff0009b9b61</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I loved everything about Elena’s.  The crepes were perfection and the coffee was fantastic. And Elena herself was a doll! Love, love, love. I will be coming back for sure!!

The shop was also following COVID-19 guidelines with masks and and social distancing being enforced. Hand sanitizer was provided and customers waited outside for their food.</Review>

<review>Kind of a long wait, but definitely worth it. Food and coffee are supreme! The couple who works here are very personable, the woman especially kind, always checking in and making sure that everyone is pleased with their order. I got the Nutella crepe and an Americano and both were great. A wonderful escape from the rain!</review>< Response>

<text>Amazing crepes here in downtown Oceanside! The owners are a sweet little couple. There was also cool artwork they've made on the wall. We tried the ham and cheese, lemon and sugar, and the condensed milk. All three were fantastic. Fun to watch them make them or just sit and enjoy your cup of coffee. Will be back for sure!</text><name>Irakli Agayev< /name><time>1561786127101<//time></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Wonderful experience. They couple running the place are super sweet and charming. Makes me feel like I'm at my grandmas house. My sister got told that she runs the place with Grandmas rules so no texting while eating. Food was really good. They give you plenty of crepe filled with whatever you choose. I got the nutella chocolate and my sister the sour cream raspberry. I can see why this place has such good reviews. Glad I stopped by!<//Text><user_id>104399075600133677144</user_id><rating>5<//rating>< username>

My sister and I popped in on a whim the other morning, and we were so impressed! Elena and her husband were so welcoming and kind, the atmosphere was artsy and relaxing, and the crepes- OH the crepes! Outstanding. My sister and I each got sweet crepes, and were blown away by both the flavor and presentation. We will definitely be returning! Absolutely would recommend.</review>

Real great food, very friendly. I really enjoy the crepes and chatting with the owners. Easy to find parking and right in the center of town. Very easy to find and really great food for the price. I also enjoyed the coffee.<//Review>

The food is delicious. Your food comes out very quickly. But most importantly the owners are amazing. Not only are they kind, but they are genuinely good and entertaining people. While I was admiring the pelican planter Elena explained to me that her husband had mad it. I loved everything about being there.< /text>

They had both savory and sweet crepes.  I had the ham and cheese crepe which was nice as well as the Nutella crepe -- also great.

Not much in the way of decor or seating inside.  Two tables were right outside.<//text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
My high expectations were exceeded. This place is very unassuming. We walked in and were greeted by Elena. She recommended the ham and cheese and the Nutella & banana. The food was served in a few minutes and dayum! The food was delicious. Somehow the ham & cheese was dense and savory yet light as a feather. It was like a grilled cheese floating on air. Don't bring your mom here because the Nutella and banana will make you slap her face. Incredible!<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Rich crepes but very small place, your added juices, fruits and chocolate milk to the menu, it would be great!

<rate>5< /rate><text>After 5+ yrs, it was time to upgrade my LG X Power to a new phone and decided to return to the store of my original purchase, Cricket Wireless at 5418 El Cajon Blvd, San Diego, CA 92115.  I had an good idea what phone I wanted to upgrade to (a good idea to do, plus it saves time) and had also checked my upgrade pricing before hand on the Cricket Wireless website.

THIS is how Customer Service should be everywhere!!  I was greeted by a young female employee, "Nora", who couldn't have been nicer.  She was courteous and knowledgeable, both technically and with their products & pricing. What's more, she genuinely seemed to enjoy her work, and as most can attest, there's nothing worse than dealing with someone in customer service who hates their job and/or doesn't want to be there.

I asked to see a Samsung Galaxy A32, which they had in stock.  Nora brought the phone out, reviewed the features with me, and gave me the upgrade pricing I was expecting, which also included a free case & "glass" screen cover.  As a fellow female associate helped to complete my paperwork & number transfer, Nora installed my screen protector, and transferred my contacts, photos, & apps over to my new phone.  In the meantime, a young male associate helped out and showed me the different case options for my new phone.  After reviewing some final phone features & security set-ups, we were done.

The whole process from the time I arrived until the time I left with new phone in hand was under an hour.  I was completely satisfied and the whole process was hassle-free!  Kudos to Nora, and her fellow associates for the great service.  Keep up the great work & customer service...it REALLY makes a difference!< /text><user_id>100201738568686994874<//user_id><pics>None< /pics><Name>David Ramsey< /Name><Resp>None</Resp></record></dataset><record>

Very professional and very informative. Didn't just try to rush me into purchasing whatever was on the display but actually went the extra step and looked online for the best phone I could get to match my budget (unlike the store at Lemon Grove where they can't be bothered to do more than they have to and literally get hostile when you press them for details in order to actually make an informed decision.) Cricket/El Cajon Blvd. the customer service is top notch- turned a bad experience into a positive one. Thank you Ivan.</Text>

Customer Service sucks.  They'd rather lose a customer than give up their practice of screwing everyone after they've had an account for a couple of months.  Their phones suck too.  Plan on returning whatever you get, and the "free" replacement will be a piece of C*** too.  Never mind you paid damned good cash for the first piece of garbage "swecond" they pawned off on you.  BTW.....YOU HAVE TO ASK FOR A REP WHO SPEAKS ENGLISH AS THEIR NATIVE TOUNGE, and don't count on getting anyone with more than a "GED" to assist you.  That means they are guaranteed to have a 3rd grade education.  CRICKET BLOWS.  You're better off paying more to get something that doesn't waste hours and days of your life.</Review>

Don't go here, they charge $25 for a new SIM card when you can get it at Cricket corporate for free. Lorena couldn't even fix the problem with the phone that Cricket caused, we had to drive to El Cajon  to go to the corporate store.< /Text>

<Review>After 5+ yrs, it was time to upgrade my LG X Power to a new phone and decided to return to the store of my original purchase, Cricket Wireless at 5418 El Cajon Blvd, San Diego, CA 92115.  I had an good idea what phone I wanted to upgrade to (a good idea to do, plus it saves time) and had also checked my upgrade pricing before hand on the Cricket Wireless website.

THIS is how Customer Service should be everywhere!!  I was greeted by a young female employee, "Nora", who couldn't have been nicer.  She was courteous and knowledgeable, both technically and with their products & pricing. What's more, she genuinely seemed to enjoy her work, and as most can attest, there's nothing worse than dealing with someone in customer service who hates their job and/or doesn't want to be there.

I asked to see a Samsung Galaxy A32, which they had in stock.  Nora brought the phone out, reviewed the features with me, and gave me the upgrade pricing I was expecting, which also included a free case & "glass" screen cover.  As a fellow female associate helped to complete my paperwork & number transfer, Nora installed my screen protector, and transferred my contacts, photos, & apps over to my new phone.  In the meantime, a young male associate helped out and showed me the different case options for my new phone.  After reviewing some final phone features & security set-ups, we were done.

The whole process from the time I arrived until the time I left with new phone in hand was under an hour.  I was completely satisfied and the whole process was hassle-free!  Kudos to Nora, and her fellow associates for the great service.  Keep up the great work & customer service...it REALLY makes a difference!</Review><user_name>David Ramsey<//user_name><user_id>100201738568686994874< /user_id>< Date>

<Text>Very professional and very informative. Didn't just try to rush me into purchasing whatever was on the display but actually went the extra step and looked online for the best phone I could get to match my budget (unlike the store at Lemon Grove where they can't be bothered to do more than they have to and literally get hostile when you press them for details in order to actually make an informed decision.) Cricket/El Cajon Blvd. the customer service is top notch- turned a bad experience into a positive one. Thank you Ivan.</Text><name>Travis Eisner</name><Response>{'time': 1606089186241, 'text': 'We are happy to see you had a great experience and were given something to smile about!'}</Response>< Rate>

Went there with a broken phone and got helped out by Ivan, hands down best customer service anyone could ask for. Not only did he help me out with a good phone that I actually like help me out a screen and a case kept me in my budget while providing excellent service.</Review>

<user_name>Solonia Venger<//user_name><Date>1301352308540</Date><Rating>1<//Rating><Review>Customer Service sucks.  They'd rather lose a customer than give up their practice of screwing everyone after they've had an account for a couple of months.  Their phones suck too.  Plan on returning whatever you get, and the "free" replacement will be a piece of C*** too.  Never mind you paid damned good cash for the first piece of garbage "swecond" they pawned off on you.  BTW.....YOU HAVE TO ASK FOR A REP WHO SPEAKS ENGLISH AS THEIR NATIVE TOUNGE, and don't count on getting anyone with more than a "GED" to assist you.  That means they are guaranteed to have a 3rd grade education.  CRICKET BLOWS.  You're better off paying more to get something that doesn't waste hours and days of your life.<//Review>< Pics>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>I wish I can give zero stars. I ordered the sweet potato roll and tasted NO sweet potato. The owner told me it was “too bad. You like some and you don’t”. I asked to bring the rolls back for another one that I liked since I was mislead with the description of the roll and he was extremely rude, talking over me and not letting me speak. The WORST tasting sweet potato roll EVER! Change the name of your roll to avocado please and work on your customer service. I am a first time customer and was disrespected by the OWNER! I know my rights and will be filing a complaint with the BBB!!! Extremely disgusted and appalled!<//text><Time>1621636007554<//Time></record>

Worst sushi, ramen, and miso soup I've ever had. I'm surprised at all of the positive reviews tbh. The miso soup had rubbery mushrooms and 3 tiny slices of seaweed (see pic). I love mushrooms but those were gross. The ramen had barely any veggies - slivers of carrots and small pieces of broccoli. It was top ramen at best. If that's what ramen looks like to you, you should try other places asap like Tajima Ramen. Sushi was subpar, but it sounds like other rolls tasted good from what other reviewers say. Mine was nasty. The picture shows what was left after I ate :( My boyfriend and I are ordering another dinner now....$70 later :/</Text>

<Review>I’ve been there a couple times never had a problem except my California rolls always falling apart when I try to grab them.  I just went tonight and as I was eating my California roll there was a hair on my roll I literally had to pull it out 😭 and I looked at the others and there was another hair in the bottom of my sushi.</Review>< resp>

Ordered on phone, had to wait about three minutes without any hold music. Ordered combination plate 6. Ready about half an hour later. Two employees were not wearing masks properly. The food was incredibly good tasting.<//Review>

Food is good, but the issue is that the chef doesn't know how to properly put on a mask. It goes over your nose too sir. I don't want people breathing on my food during these times, I'm already taking risks going here. Meet us halfway...</Review>

Great little sushi spot in La Mesa, hit up the Happy Hours for great deals! This plate is: Mimi Chan, Cowles Mountain, Tuna Kahuna, Crunchy Mango, and Grumpy Cat rolls. I do recommend the Melting Cat as well!< /Text>

WOW! Best sushi I have had in San Diego. After living in Japan and visiting South Korea I was searching for sushi to help scratch the itch it left when I came back. Portion sizes are outstanding for what they cost. Will definitely return!</Text>

This place was so good the first time I went naturally I was excited to bring my girlfriend to Arigato shusi. This was a all around bad experience!! Here is how it went down. First we are told to sit ourselves  but all of the empty tables were filthy not cleaned off so we found the only seat it was up front that seemed to annoy our server maybe that's why she never brought us menues chopsticks or napkins. It keeps going down hill, when we have to tracker her down for refills on our drinks and when we say "thank you" she just sighs and walks off it does not sit well.. So for the shushi we ordered the Alalaska roll that I have been raving about among other rolls (they completely forgot to make one) and when they finally get to the table we can smell one of the rolls has that fishy smell!!! THE NUBMER ONE RED FLAG WITH SHUSHI IS FISHY SMELL!! Because when it smells like that it is not "shushi grade" anymore and... It's the salmon on the Alaska roll! we tried a few peices and the smell and taste was disgusting! It was almost ruining the other rolls(which were good) with its funk. I have to mention that we saw our server the blonde one chugging beer trying to hide in the kitchen and the shushi chef with the man bun and beard was drinking beer between making rolls and not washing his hands. When the bill came I told her about the issue with the salmon smell and quality, she told the shushi chef and came and said he told her since we ate off it we had to pay for it and became argumentative because she and he were drunk! I said we are not paying for bad salmon that probably has bacteria growing in it! And we will glady pay for everything else or pay nothing. She had to get it ok'd and we go to pay and they say it's cash only now because the machine is down but we overhead them saying she unplugged the phone (maybe so they wouldn't get anymore phone orders on Saturday night) so I had to go get cash to pay. This was a terrible experience I would advise against this place unless you want to gamble with your health and bad service. Unless changes are made I will never come back and put the word out for people I care about to do the same.  The way the employees  were  drinking and all lax makes you wonder what other health codes they were neglecting!< /Review>

Just wishing they would pay just a little more attention, the salad leaves are wilty and the salad got mixed in the curry, and that's not how I wanted it.

<Review>Please, ignore the bad reviews of Arigato and check it out for yourself.  The rice Arigato uses is the best sushi rice I have ever had ANYWHERE, and trust me when I say so as I've been to a LOT of sushi places all over the country.  The owner and chef is an amazing man with a lot of ideas and a kind heart who remembers the regulars that come, he remembered my mom and I after the first time we had gone.  Some of the staff is okay and some are awesome, but what you go for isn't that but rather the food because that's what really matters.  The chef has created many new and different rolls including different ingredients you've never heard of in sushi.  Go to Arigato, don't miss out!</Review>< Pics>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>I woke up 2 in the morning starving and my bf lost the key to my car. I went on door dash and this place is one of the two places still open in my area. Their hours on Tuesday say they don't close until 3:30AM! I see they have received my order &my dasher is on the way to get my food after 20 minutes of my order being “made” then I get an email at 3:39AM saying they're going to issue me a refund within 7 days.
If you guys wanted to get off your shift in time you should have canceled my order RIGHT when you got it and not have my DoorDash driver drive all the way there.<//Text>< pictures>

I have been here many times. The first several times everything was great, especially the food. I went twice in January and was told each time that I was there at the wrong time for happy hour. They continuously change their happy hour to trick their customers. The second time I went that month, I literally read the sign outside the store and it said it was happy hour at that moment. I went in and asked for the happy hour menu and was told that the happy hour wouldn’t start for another hour. I told her the sign says otherwise, and she just gave me attitude saying that they changed it and it’s an old sign. Then change the damn sign. Or just put a piece of paper over the time, this isn’t that difficult. I decided to give them another chance recently because they’re food is good. Called in a pick up order and she told me it would be ready in 30 minutes. I got there exactly 30 minutes after our phone call and I still had to wait an extra 15 minutes. She said it would be “right out” then didn’t say anything for 15 minutes. But of course she charged me for it as soon as I walked in the door. Took the food home and found two hairs in it. For the prices you charge people, you need to have much better customer service. I like supporting small businesses but I’m giving up on y’all.<//Text>

Been going here over 10 years, my favorite sushi spot around! The sushi always tastes very fresh and the rolls are interesting and exciting. The sushi here can easily compete with the more expensive and "fancier" places. Presentation is great, service is perfect and very friendly. Good beer selection, carrying the local favorites. Prices are fair, place is cozy and keeps getting better.</review>

I love restaurants where the owner is alway the chef. If you sit at the bar you get to talk with him. I personally love sushi rools with citrus and they have an abundance of them to choose from. Happy hour here is legit, me and the wife got a total of 4 rolls and a few drinks and got out of there for under 50 bucks. I call that a win!< /text>

So I tried this place for the first time today. Waitress had a stuck up attitude. Customers at the sushi bar were loud and obnoxious. The waitress was drinking and being loud with them????? Really? On top of all that I was brought the wrong food order TWICE. Food is good and it's not a bad place. Instead of partying, focus on customer service. It will go a long way.<//Review>

< Review>
I have eaten here three times and it has been a hit or miss place. First was was during their happy hour and we got seated right away, the waitress was very attentive and the prices were very reasonable.
Second time we came back and got the salmon skin which was not good at all and my rainbow roll took almost 25 minutes to get delivered? Everybody else had their food from our table except my friend. It was a light day but we only saw the waitress a few times.
Third time we came when it was very busy and understood the food would take a while. The waitress was very nice but it took almost 35 minutes to get our main dishes served. We even canceled our  last roll because it didn't get delivered with the rest of the food and we were already done with everything that came first.  The waitress was nice and we could see she was busy with larger parties.

The quality of the food is pretty good, portions are good and the decor is nice and spacious. Clean establishment but try and visit during a light day<//Review>

<text>The Rolls were great! The service was horrible.  It took 15 minutes to have a server come to our table after we were seated.  They were closing at 9:30 so at 9:05 we asked for our check.  At 9:08 the workers started blasting rap music loudly throughout the entire place.  The workers started to take shots of alcohol at the bar and party.  Our server disapeared from 9:08 to 9:29 and then came back with the check to apologize about the loud music and the long wait.

On top off the poor service...we were overcharged for an item we did not order.

I won't eat here again.  They need to really work on their customer service!< /text>< user>

Good food, bad service. The on-site owner/manager/sushi-chef doesn't handle negative feedback well. This used to be my favorite Japanese restaurant. I was a customer of his for over 5 years, and went there 3 to 5 times a month. March 3, 2019 was the one-and-only time I had negative feedback. His response was hostile enough that I have not back.< /review>

First time here, decided to give it a shot. Gyoza was way too salty and steamed badly, clearly frozen. Didn’t say on menu if it’s steamed or pan fried, most places give option. Got a Firecracker roll specifically because it didn’t have crab listed as an ingredient and I don’t like crab, but there was crab in the roll. Sushi roll didn’t taste fresh. The people were nice but I’m never going back, super disappointed. Trying to find a good sushi place in La Mesa but looks like I’ll have to keep going to Kearney Mesa for good sushi.</Review>

I'm visiting my sister, and she told me we had to go to Arigato. In the afternoons on the week days they have a half price happy hour, and on Sundays it's all day. We fed 4 people to bursting with fresh flavorful sushi for $40. (Including tax and tip) so impressed, and it was totally delicious!<//text>

We use to go there for many years. For some unknown reason the service has gone downhill and the servers have became downright rude. One rude server loudy complained that he only made $45 in tips over 5 shifts. Apparently his tips were a reflection of his attitude. The food has also nosedived.

On the upside this place is always emtpy now so you can sit anywhere you want. Back when it was a good place to eat this was not the case. Do like all their old customers are now doing and avoid this place. We are.<//Review>

For the price we paid here, even with a Groupon, I felt like everything was just okay. I feel like our family could have gotten a bigger bang for our buck for this type of food. Nothing was bad, but I just don't see myself going out of my way again to eat here. Customer service was just okay, but location and Ambiance honestly does not justify the price tag. We honestly left a little bit hungry. May be worth it for a light meal if you happen to be in the area already and craving Americanized Japanese food.  But there is no way I would pay full price.</text>

<Review>We went there last week for the first time. We genuinely liked the atmosphere. We did order of the happy hour menu and it was delicious. The waitress mentioned twice that she was brand new. There was definitely some discontent displayed by other patrons sitting on the table next to ours for long wait times for getting drinks. We did not experience this, however we noticed today that we had been double charged by the restaurant. So we figured the new gal may have made a mistake and so we went there to talk to them. After going down there we were sent off with a simple "our record does not show this" , "I cannot not help you". However our bank records, in hand,  clearly stated that both amounts were already paid to this restaurant. Long story short we were sent on our way, no contact information of ours was taken down to set this matter straight during quieter hours, nothing! Very disappointing, we sadly had to turn to our bank to open an investigation. Just very poor handling of this situation!<//Review>< gmap_id>

I really enjoy coming here and think the food, especially the sushi, is excellent! I was talking to the owner today & we figured that I have been coming here for almost 19 years. He started working here soon after I started coming here. I haven't tried everything on the menu because I'm a habitual eater... My favorite is the Super Salmon roll however recently Ive tried other rolls & items from the menu. I'm satisfied every time I come and I have yet to try a dish or roll that I don't like.

I've moved in and out of state and every time I'm in the area I stop in for lunch or dinner. I currently live in LA however, I'm moving out of state again soon... I will be back for a dynamite dish and a chef's choice roll next week.

The green tea, miso soup, gyoza, and edamame are all flavorful and well cooked.

They've been open for 25 years and adding Ramen soon. I'm looking forward to trying their interpretation of Ramen.</Review>

<review>We were very disappointed in the food at this japanese restaurant..i ordered fish which i had to send back because it wasnt cooked enough..the rice was not fresh..the miso soup was salty with a odd color..our server was very young and dressed inappropriate, if she would of bent over her butt would of been exposed..i called the manager Humberto who did not return my call..i had to call him the following day..he made excuses for each item..do not waste your money here!! Its over priced<//review>< rating>

Went with a group and they were able to split up the bill. They did mix up the cards and charged the wrong amount but once notified they fixed our issues. Staff was friendly. Look for specials on Groupon. Basically its your average strip mall sushi place.<//Review>< Pics>

This restaurant has horrible customer service. When i went in last night, i was not acknowledge till about 5/10 mins (mind you there were NOT busy) then 15 mins pass by and we still did not get a waitress or offered water or anything. While another table who got in after us, we served right away. Even after mentioning that i had been waiting for a while to the waitress Christine, she said she would get "our waitress". Which she never did. And when i tried to speak to the manager he wasnt there. I tried calling the next day about my experience, still no manager. This place needs to be shut down for horrible service< /Text>

< Review>
This used to be my favorite neighborhood sushi spot, about 3-5 years ago. I decided to try it again for old times sake, ignoring warnings about the prices being high. I placed the order over the phone (pleasant experience) but when I arrived to pick up my order, I wasn't acknowledged. This was at 2pm in the afternoon, with NO customers to wait on. The latina woman at the stove just stared at me until I told her I was here to pick up an order. Then some other woman took her time processing the payment. For $30 I ordered a fried california roll that wasn't crunchy, a Philadelphia roll and a small order (5 pcs) of salmon sashimi. The food itself was okay but the poor customer service when the restaurant was dirty (tables unclean) and empty makes me not able to return as a customer. Too bad, it used to be so good< /Review>

<Review>Garlic spicy Edamame.  Perfect blend of sirachi and garlic.  Not too spicy. Miso was pretty yum too.  Not much of sake selection, so spend the extra bucks for the filtered cold.  And everything, literally everything was fresh, tasty and amazing.  I had teriyaki meat n chicken, wife had sashimi, we shared the seafood and seaweed salad in vinegar and it was good, crunchy mango was done well with a good mix of sauce and mango.  Highly recommend you try it.</Review>< rating>

<Review>Such beautiful rings! My husband got my engagement ring here, and we returned for our wedding bands. We loved the variety to choose from and how Kasia Jewelry helped us through the process of picking rings that worked together and that fit our personalities and lifestyles. I can definitely see us coming back for future purchases!< /Review>< Rate>

<Text>It was an absolute pleasure working with Kasia and her team on a custom ring project. They far exceeded every expectation I had for this process. From the introduction, to sourcing stones, to design the setting - every step was professional and easy. We are very happy with the final product and we are already planning to work with Kasia again.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>I had such a wonderful experience with Kasia. I scheduled a virtual styling appointment for my wedding band, and I was worried that it would be difficult to picture the rings without seeing them in person. Kasia came totally prepared - she had on an engagement ring that was similar to mine, so she used that to compare the different wedding bands I picked out ahead of time. I actually ended up choosing a different wedding band and went with one that she had recommended. I am so glad she showed it to me because it looks absolutely perfect with my engagement ring. Kasia was so sweet and patient throughout the entire process, which I appreciated since purchasing a once-in-a-lifetime kind of item is not always an easy task. I will definitely be purchasing more jewelry from Kasia!< /review><rating>5< /rating><user_id>106937801669739525153</user_id>< name>

<Text>Kasia and her team are just amazing. I was looking for a ring that felt special, sophisticated and "me". I was so happy when my now fiance proposed with the most stunning ring! We went back months later to try on wedding bands and decided to go with the full KJ experience which is honestly the BEST <3. I'm the luckiest to have such a beautiful wedding set! My rings are Layla and Celine.

My now husband and I went to go get my wedding band at Kasia after he had already purchased my engagement ring from there. He was deployed in Guam while he was working with Chloe to find my engagement ring. He said Chloe was very good at sending him detailed videos so that he could make the best decision from far away. His pick was PERFECT! <3

A couple of weeks after getting engaged, we went back so that I could choose my wedding band. The in-person experience was also great!!! I definitely felt safe going in there during COVID times. They made sure everything was sanitized, and they had well thought of procedures to make sure all touched bands/ rings were not put back in the batch with the others so that they could sanitize the touched rings. Everyone was also wearing masks.

There were a variety of rings to choose from from all different price ranges. I loved the different types of rings and bands for all of the different types of brides - alternative, edgy, romantic, vintage, and very blingy. They had various stones and designs to choose from as well. My ring combination is unlike others I have seen (on non-Kasia brides), and it looks great on! I have gotten so many compliments on it. I will definitely be going back to get a second band that I also fell in love with!! (I'm coming for ya Sloane!) I would not hesitate to refer and recommend Kasia to anyone. A big thank you to the team for being so great! I am OBSESSED with both of my rings!! THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!  <3 -Karen & Jeff</Text>

We couldn't recommend Kasia Jewelry enough. Chloe is an unbelievably proficient sales person with tons of positive energy and a wealth of knowledge. My fiance has known Kasia for many years so when it came time to pop the questions we couldn't think of a better story. Chloe walked us through all of the options, painted the picture and helped us put together something truly unique and tasteful. The experience can be overwhelming for many, so we're happy that she was there to patiently work with us and break it down in a way that was easy and lighthearted.
We had options at our meeting and in the end I was able to work with her to design something elegant, unique and truly what my fiance would swoon over. Thanks to the team there for making my lady's dream come true!< /review>

<name>Brian Frawley<//name><Text>It was a pleasure to work with Kasia and the whole team. Going into the process, we knew nothing about diamonds or jewelry and our first appointment with Chloe made us feel right at home. She explained everything very clearly and we felt as if we made the right choice going into the design. During the design process, Kasia was very receptive to our ideas and always responded in a timely manner. Their positive mentalities and creative minds truly made us feel like they cared about the customer. This definitely is not the last time we will work with them and we will for sure be recommending them to our friends!<//Text>< gmapID>

Such a good experience! I initially went to Kasia for my wedding band and engagement ring. I really loved her salt and pepper diamonds! I was so happy and loved the experience so much, I went back for my anniversary band to finish out my stack! The staff is so friendly and helpful and the atmosphere is light, romantic, and relaxing. I will definitely go back again in the future!<//review>

<Review>Kasia and her team are amazing! My now husband had an incredible experience working with Kasia on the perfect engagement ring, which led to us meeting her again a few months after and ordering our wedding bands too. The whole experience has been so special to us both and we couldn’t be more proud and in love with our unique, beautifully made wedding jewelry (which everyone comments on and loves!) thanks Kasia for a truly personable, positive experience. We highly recommend Kasia Jewelry.< /Review>< pics>

<review>The ladies at Kasia are terrific.  I bought an engagement and wedding band for my wife and my wife bought my wedding band there as well so we have worked with them on numerous occasions.  Terrific quality diamonds and great products and service from the ladies in the store.  Feels nice to support a small business especially during these tough times instead of going to one of the larger jewelry stores.  Will definitely be making more purchases at Kasia in the future.<//review>< GmapID>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Kasia, Chloe and their team are simply amazing.   I have made two purchases over the past year (a gift for my 25 year old daughter and a gift for a dear friend).   Both times, the purchase experience was terrific.   For example, Kasia herself showed up for the appointment with my daughter and spent over 50 minutes showing my daughter all the items she had interest in but also, importantly, taking time to discuss the genesis behind each item's design, the materials used and the particular craftmanship necessary to achieve the final outcome.  My daughter, as expected,  was so impressed by this level of service.  In fact, we already plan to return to Kasia when my daughter is back in town for Thanksgiving next month for "this year's gift."   I highly recommend Kasia if you are looking for something unique, sophisticated and desire terrific service.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1604620276864, 'text': 'Thank you so much for the kind words and the continued support, John!

<Rate>5</Rate><text>When I first started trying on engagement rings I fell love with the warmth of champagne diamonds. After searching for jewelers who specialized in alternative bridal I found the Queen herself, Kasia. My now fiancée and I visited a pop-up in San Francisco and after spending time talking and trying on rings we settled on the Alli ring. Kasia and Ashley are so genuine and kind, they made the experience so special. I recently visited the showroom in San Diego to pick out my wedding band.... How can I be expected to wait until my wedding day to wear it?! Not happening! I feel so lucky to have found Kasia and can’t wait to add more of her pieces to my collection.< /text>< Pics>

Stunning, unique, show stopping, simple, traditional, elegant, modern; anything you’re looking for I promise Kasia has. Not only did I fall completely head over heels for the ring of my dreams, but I found something I didn’t even know I needed. Chloe, one of Kasia’s staff, knew instantly exactly what I was looking for and made the process so easy for my partner to follow through with the surprise. I have not and will not buy another piece of jewelry from anywhere else, this place is it. The quality for the cost is unbeatable. To have staff that actually care about your style, needs, and bank account is rare, but Kasia really nailed it.< /Text>

I had the pleasure of working with Chloe on designing an engagement ring for my now fiancé. Being a stereotypical man, I had little to no knowledge of what was a good deal, but I trusted Kasia because they were recommended by a close friend. Chloe took the time to educate me and guide me through the process. She even upgraded the original diamond I had selected to a larger one at no extra cost just because they cared about the finished product. I am extremely happy with my experience and my fiancé can’t stop looking at her finger. We will be returning customers when it comes time for our wedding bands.<//Review>

What an amazing company!!  Their items are beautiful and their team is top notch! Chloe helped me by doing a one-one-one video call with me to show me the ring up close that I was interested in and help me see what it would look like on my index finger and mixed with my other every day jewelry.  She followed up by text.  I’m so excited to receive my ring in the mail!!!</text>

We had such a great experience at Kasia. We got my engagement ring and wedding band there. My husband and I had a hard time finding that special ring elsewhere, but right when we saw Kasia's Muse ring, we knew we found my ring. I absolutely love it. The rings are unique yet elegantly timeless.<//review>

In terms of COVID - I felt completely at ease. You make an appointment for the showroom and are the only customer in there, everything is sanitized, they take your temperature, have hand sanitizer, masks, etc.

Wonderful experience all around and love my ring!< /text>< GmapID>

I had my eye on a Kasia wedding band soon after our engagement. After we postponed our wedding we decided to still have an intimate ceremony this year and that meant hopefully getting the band I have been dreaming of! I had been in contact with Chloe for a while before I was able to go in for an appointment. When I showed up Chloe made sure I felt comfortable and was extremely warm and inviting. I ended up falling in love with Asiah (one I had been wanting) and Angelica (one that was not even on my radar that Chloe had me try on). I was so torn I had to sleep on it and she was so sweet to even post a poll on Instagram. The next day I asked to come in last minute to try on the rings one more time and I bought the ring that day!

The quality is amazing and there are so many unique beautiful rings to choose from. The showroom is so pretty and well decorated. Such a cute little spot on Cedros. What made my experience so amazing was Chloe. She truly cared about helping me make the right decision and asked the right questions to help me get there. She was kind, helpful, understanding, and has such good energy.  Its such a weird time to be a bride and Chloe helped me get excited again. I’m looking forward to wearing my new ring soon!< /Text>

My virtual appointment with Kasia was an absolutely amazing experience! I’m so thankful this was available because I don’t live in California and needed so much help with selecting my wedding band. Kasia helped me narrow down the choices by pairing the band with a ring very similar to my engagement ring and virtually showing me how it looked. She would also send picture texts with the options, which was again, so helpful! I appreciated her excitement she had for her pieces and her joy at guiding me through this process. I would suggest everyone who is interested in purchasing jewelry from here to schedule a virtual appointment because I’m counting down the days until I need to schedule another one!< /Text>

<Review>I can't say enough about how easy my experience was with Kasia Jewelry using their virtual appointments! I was searching for the perfect finishing touch (crown) for my wedding band stack at locations near me but kept thinking about the beautiful bands that I saw on Kasia's website /instagram. I decided to do a virtual appointment with them to understand the process and decide if I was comfortable buying a ring "virtually" (without trying it on or seeing it in person). Chloe was a delight! She made it really easy for me to understand the process, sent me real time pictures of what the stack design could look like, and answered all my questions. One day later, I bought my ring and could not be more excited to get in a couple weeks!<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>Our virtual session with Kasia was this evening and wow, where do I begin. A true artisan, Kasia is beyond talented in her work. She is professional, personable, and full of love for what she does. I was nervous about the process and of course wished I could be there in person. Even though I'm on the opposite coast, I couldn't have felt more welcomed and included in a process that is so meaningful and personal.

I highly recommend Kasia Jewelry!!</Text>< Pictures>

A lot of experiences get taken away from you when you’re a covid bride. Trying on bands was one of those things, especially because a lot of places weren’t able to get new stock in. That’s why I was so ecstatic when I found Kasia! They had this great idea of doing a virtual try on.You tell them what styles you are interested in and you get set up with a stylist. Mine was the lovely Chloe! They ended up getting an engagement ring so similar to mine the day before the appointment and so we had about an hour appointment trying bands. It really helped to see how the band would sit a ring so close to mine. I was able to really narrow down my choices and afterwards she sent pics of all of my favorites to make it easy on making a choice! She followed up with me after and as I was leaning closer towards a contour ring style, I viewed their website one last time and ended up seeing a band on there that I didn’t see during our appointment. I messaged Chloe right away & found out it just came in! I knew it was the one and once I ordered, it came in right on time. I am obsessed with it and have no doubt I made the right choice! Getting married through COVID is no joke so I am so happy I found Kasia and Chloe! They made at least one thing way easier for me! ❤️< /Text>

I’ve been eyeing Kasia jewelry for quite some time. I had originally been looking there for potential engagement ring options, but my fiancé and I chose a different jeweler for my main ring. When it came time to choose a wedding band, I quickly chose Kasia because of the beautiful and stunning range of unique bands they carry. We had a virtual meeting with Chloe (during the pandemic, as we didn’t feel comfortable trying to travel), and she curated many options to show us that she thought would pair well with my ring. She sent me endless photos of various ring stacks when I couldn’t make up my mind, and helped send us an easy invoice for ordering once we decided.  I received my wedding band a few weeks ago, and it is even more stunning in person. Absolutely amazing quality and worth every penny. We loved our experience with Kasia, and plan to order my fiancé’s band soon as well. I can’t wait to continue to add Kasia pieces to my lifelong jewelry story.< /Review>

Kasia has been a dream to work with, from the moment I initially contacted her to find the perfect E-ring to helping us with wedding band parings.  She has made the process so enjoyable and has been so accommodating and attentive. The virtual appointment process is a great option and it a nice way to connect face to face. Thank you so much Kasia and we can't wait to meet you in person someday soon! xo Leslie & Kevin< /Review>

My fiancé and I met Kasia 2 years ago at a pop up at the Dress Theory Seattle. We instantly felt like we’ve known Kasia for years after just talking to her for a short 30 min. Kasia’s jewelry isn’t only a one of a kind (she picks these diamonds herself) but Kasia and her team are so welcoming and make you feel like you are the only ones in the room. They value your time and your interests. And there’s no doubt you’ll walk away with something you absolutely love. My fiancé and I love to come to the pop ups any time they make it to Seattle. And were able to pick out our wedding bands before Covid hit. Ashley and Chloe took down the measurements and ring names and when we were ready to order months later, process was easy and seamless! Highly recommend Kasia Jewelry! Can’t wait to keep adding to the stack!<//Text>

So very worth every single penny!! Today I was supposed to marry my fiancé and finally(!!) get to wear my Kasia wedding band. However, I know good things happen to those who wait (for pandemics to be over 🤦🏻‍♀️) and so now it’s in September that I finally get to slip my gorgeous ring on! If anyone is dreaming of a Kasia piece, I wholeheartedly recommend them. Their product and presentation literally outdoes any competition out there. 💍</Review>

Picking out Engagement rings with my partner is an experience that I wanted to feel special and personal. I found Kasia Jewelry through Instagram and immediately fell in love! We were able to schedule a virtual design appointment with ease, and even though we are on the complete opposite coast from her and her team, I was immediately given that special and personal experience I was seeking. Kasia’s passion for her work is so inspiring- she’s a true artisan. I can’t wait for my partner and I to wear her gorgeous pieces!<//Review>

Was looking for a push present for my preggo wifey :) who already loves Kasia Jewelry, and have to say the experience working with them and finding something special was pretty amazing end:end.

I booked an appointment online to go to their showroom, and before arriving talked to Chloe so that she could get a sense for my wife's style. I took pictures of her current jewelry, and Kasia had her profile in their system to see what she had purchased in the past. When I arrived, I was greeted by Chloe who was professional and personable, the showroom had a very boutique vibe with lots of polish...it was beautiful, and from my convo with Chloe prior she had an array of possible rings, necklaces and bangles that she felt may fit my wife's style.

I ended up getting a beautiful bullet ring, and am very appreciative of Chloe's patience as I processed all of my options, looked through the store and even roped in one of my wife's best friends to provide some guidance. So happy I went to them for this beautiful gift to mark the occasion of our beautiful little girl coming into this world and know my wife will love her gift from one of her already favorite jewelers.

Thanks Kasia Jewelry and thanks Chloe!</text>

<Review>During this scary and unknown time I’m sure I’m not the only soon to be Bride that is stressing over wedding planning. My Fiancé went to Kasia for my engagement ring and it’s been love ever since! Her variety of unique and timeless designs are fitting for ANY bride. The jewelry alone is to die for but it’s the service that will keep you coming back to build your jewelry archives. Kasia is very hands on and is so accommodating they even have virtual appointments available during these crazy times. I’m so happy me and my Fiancé took advantage of this, we found the bands we love! There was so much warmth coming through the screen you wouldn’t even know it wasn’t a face to face appointment.</Review>< pics>

<review>What’s more stressful than picking out a perfect engagement ring? Picking out a perfect engagement ring during Corona Virus. I had the best experience working with Kasia and my stylist Chloe.

Chloe did an amazing job at asking my fiancé all of the right questions when we visited the showroom.

Kasia was so diligent making sure I felt super comfortable finalizing the custom ring via pictures and phone calls during quarantine.

We are amazed at the final product and couldn’t recommend their team enough. If you want the perfect ring, I’d give them a call.

Thanks again Kasia & Chloe!

<Text>Kasia was amazing! My girlfriend (fiance now!)is a big fan of Kasia and then we ran into Kasia at a pop-up shop in the West Elm in Santa Monica. It was truly meant to be. Kasia and Ashley were so great helping us choose a ring. They were totally honest with us and told us to go with the smaller and less expensive diamond even though we did not listen. We trust their opinion so much and we will continue to recommend them to all.<//Text>< pics>

<text>I fell in love with Kasia's aesthetic as I began my wedding journey more than a year ago. I was finally able to meet her team at the Kimpton Hotel popup in Boston (last time she was on the east coast there was a blizzard) and found not one but two spectacular bands to frame my engagement ring. There were so many amazing contour bands to try. The team thoughtfully and gracefully styled me with something I never would have chosen myself- all while hosting my sister cousin and myself with champagne and giggles. Overall Kasia makes everything look and feel so effortless!<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIDyi1CpKMYkUIt8ek6wLlWZgmwAr-EQCdzWQ2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Resp>

<userid>117969123092318928701< /userid><review>Oh my goodness, where do I even begin! Let’s start with you ABSOLUTELY need to check out Kasia Jewelry. Not only is the brand as a whole amazing, but so are the ladies that are apart of this company. If there was an option to give a million stars, I would easily be able to give them that. K designs the most stunningly unique pieces and there is a piece for everyone in their collection.

Our journey with Kasia started when I found them on Instagram a few years ago and have been hooked ever since. I sent my boyfriend (now fiancé, ahhh!) a ring that they had just created. We both fell in love with the pieces they had, especially that E Ring. Fast forward a couple years, Kasia and her team had a pop up in the Bay Area and my fiancé and I went to check them out. I tried on my dream ring and I unknowingly joined the Kasia Tribe that day, Drake bought the ring!! I thought someone else had purchased it because it was sold on their website, I was so bummed. A few months after that, while zip lining in Alaska he proposed and totally caught me off guard. My dream ring wasn’t purchased by another customer, but by Drake.

Kasia and the lovely ladies we’re back in the Bay and this time we were seeing them to figure out what wedding bands we were getting for the both of us! I couldn’t wait to see the ladies and let me tell you, they really make you feel so comfortable and warm. Purchasing very special pieces such as engagement rings, wedding rings & wedding bands can be very overwhelming, but never once did we feel like that. Every time we have talked or met up with the ladies of Kasia, it was like we were family and made the process sooo enjoyable. Not only are they so sweet, but they are also so very talented and knowledgable on all their pieces and of other pieces that would make a great story with what they have in their collection.

They helped us and guided us through every detail, even down to customizing pieces if we decided to go with that route. We thought we were going to have to customize bands to fit with my unique ring, but K & Ashley were able to help us find bands in their existing collection that could pair with my ring. Drake was able to choose one of the bands while I chose the other and we were able to create the most epic story! I literally had a jaw dropping moment and I really can’t wait to wear my bands with my e ring. Even while picking my fiancé’s ring, they made it so easy and showed us all their rings and taught us so much about the different finishes / sizes we could go with. We were able to pick out his ring and he is also super excited for his ring!

There help and warmness doesn’t just stop with e ring / wedding rings. We were able to visit their store in Solana Beach this past February with my Aunty and they were able to help us choose some stunning necklaces that are now forever on! And their showroom….STUNNING! It is so dreamy and has the best vibes. You could literally spend all day there. I can’t wait to go back and bring my fiancé as well.

Thank you to the ladies at Kasia! I can’t wait to create more memories and add more pieces to my forever collection. We love you <3 Sending lots of hugs your way!</review>< Pictures>

<review>Service was great! However, my order of fish & chips was really salty. Although the menu said the fish & chips comes with coleslaw, I got a big chunk of cornbread and butter. Who eats cornbread with fried fish? Hopefully this was just a simple mistake.</review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

I keep saying to myself hmm. I’m not sure what happened here. I ordered to-go on the phone - very friendly service (hence the 2 stars instead of 1). We ordered a bowl of chili and the chicken pot pie. Thanks to the person who posted their current menu a few reviews back, since their menu online does not display prices unless you go to GrubHub and I had to quiz the girl on what each item cost which was kind of annoying (and they don’t have menus to take with you when you arrive).

What really disappointed us was the temperature of the food, and I picked it up within 10 minutes of placing the order so it’s not like it sat there for a long time. The chili was pretty standard flavor and warm but not hot. The cornbread was provided fridge cold. The chicken pot pie was cold - needed to heat it up in the oven before I could eat it (called the store to ask them for the temperature to heat it up... they didn’t seem super surprised or apologetic that it was cold). The other concerning thing was the flavor of the gravy (or chicken?) tasted like there was pork or sausage somewhere in there... And I don’t eat pork. Not what I expected from a Marie Calendar’s chicken pot pie. It was also pretty oversalted to the point where I could only eat about half of it.

I have fond memories of going to Marie Calendars with my mom, wanted to give our local one a try. Wasn’t very satisfied. 🤷‍♀️< /Review>

Their pies are world famous and one needs to go much in advance during busy times like Christmas and thanksgiving. They have a number of flavours including traditional favourites and more innovative new concoctions.

Got the German chocolate pie and it was fantastic. The chocolate had flakes of coconut which added another dimension of flavour. Soft and fresh. Crust was fresh but crisp.

A medium pie lasts two people a week. Very much worth the cost.<//Review>

<text>You have to enter with the expectations of a large chain restaurant similar to Olive Garden. Once the expectations are set, it was a nice place to be reminded of traditional American dining of yore with a similar clientele to match. We just sat down for the dessert pies which hit the spot to end our cravings. The pecan pie, apple cobbler, and banana cream pie were all pretty tasty. Albeit a little mass manufactured but still a place to reminisce about childhood flavors.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>Marie Callenders is not just for the
silver generation. It is for all who
quest for high quality baked goods
and old timey spells cast by an arcane
mage. Dare to challenge its expert
chicanery? A river of molten butter
surrounds circular paper stripped
muffin bottoms in a decadent festival
of unforgiving richness. Undeniable
in its potions, prefecture and
prominence. Perfection.</review>< pictures>

Marie Callender's is always great for that down-home country feel and you have a hankering for some good cornbread and comfort food. I've been going to this particular location since I was pretty young and I always enjoy the classic feel here. Ample parking, quick service, and friendly waiters! This last time we came for their seasonal peach pie which is usually sold out but we were able to get one of the last few and it was delicious!</text>

It's not spectacular, but not horrible (hence the 3 stars).  They do like to use "Chef Mic" (microwave) often, but other than that seems okay.  We have been for the Sunday brunch and were not really impressed.  They have a lot of food, but it's all pretty forgettable.  The omelette, pancake, waffle station where they will make options on demand was pretty good and definitely fresh compared to the rest of the food.  The pie table was pretty good and a good deal as a pie there is pretty expensive.  So...go get and omelette and some pie and be happy.  They are not that busy, so I'm not sure how much longer they will be in business there...however, they have been there for some time and have survived, so who knows.  We will continue to go there as long as they are there.< /Text>< rate>

This place sure knows how to make a good pie, whether it be a dinner pie or a dessert pie. There aren't that many in the San Jose area, but if you can find one it sure is a treat. You have lots of different options for meals, but I highly recommend the chicken pot pie and lemon meringue pie.< /text>

I love the fruit seasonal pies here, also banana cream is amazing 😋.Great to have this place still here as a classic pie restaurant and eatery. Unfortunately there's only two left in the Bay area but many in LA. I asked the waiter how long the place had been around he said since about 1970. Wow 40yrs ish??!</Review>

We were so excited to find a Marie calendars then find out when we got there that they dont do dine in only take out. We did get pieces of pie but the guy put it in a paper bag and the top one fell over.</review>

<Review>I ordered the steak through the local delivery network.  This is the exact description of what I ordered: "Angus Top Sirloin Steak: Seasoned and seared 8 oz. Angus top sirloin with caramelized onions and sautéed mushrooms, finished with rosemary-garlic butter and grilled fresh asparagus. Served with loaded mashed potatoes." The picture is what I received.  I am so completely baffled I'm not sure what to do. Do you see caramelized onions, sauteed mushrooms, rosemary-garlic butter, or grilled asparagus anywhere on there??  I did request they sub out the mashed potatoes for a side salad which they did.  But this dried out hunk of meat that they served me was completely inedible, and didn't even come with 4/5 of the things listed on the menu.<//Review><Resp>None</Resp><user_name>Sarah Jolly</user_name>< pictures>

Warning: their "German Chocolate" pie is over-sweet choco pudding poured into a pie crust. We found it disgusting.  We can make similar (nasty) flavored pie from a box of $1.28 Jell-O Chocolate Instant Pudding

On the positive side, we do love their: Cherry pie, no-sugar Apple pie, and Rhubarb pies.  Also their dinner sides are excellent such as their gravy, stuffing, mashed potatoes, etc.</review>

<Name>Sandra Newton Bickford Perry<//Name><text>Always a fun place!  Babana pie had large chunks of banana; not slices.  Difficult to eat. (Could have brought a whole banana from home if I wanted chunks of banana.) The pie size was super tiny!!  Look like it was cut from a small section from an already cut slice of pie!! Turkey was too salty...drank water for that issue.  Cranberry sauce was dry and tasted old.  Cornbread..always great!  Dressing had no flavor.  Veggies and gravy was good!  In my opinion, I should have ordered something else...a big mistake from my wallet.  Won't order the turkey dinner or banana cream pie again.< /text><rate>1<//rate><response>None</response><pictures>None</pictures><gmapID>0x808fb5df5e082253:0xb0e5b62315f1a615</gmapID><userid>106707739723626297032< /userid>< date>

Been to MC many times over the years. Always like their pie.
Tonight we just stopped for a quick dinner because we were in the area.
I ordered the thai shrimp skillet, and others ordered the chick & steak skillet & the Frisco burger. Frisco burger & thai skillet were good, but there was no chick in the chicken & steak skillet. Said it was also too sweet.
Service was excellent, and everything else was good, especially the pie.</Text>

For me, it was my mothers favorite place, sadly I cannot share it directly with her any more.
Lol, I know the increase in cost would have been hard on her social security. It was cold outside, I asked to sit in a warm place.  I should have left because I never warmed up. More disapointing is my food was not warm. I asked for extra sauce later to warm up my ribs ordered but the sauce was very cold. I had to leave. Sorry mom.<//review>

Very good comfort food, better than most other locations of the same chain. Service is usually excellent though can be spotty once in a while. Usually when business is slow and there's no evidence of a manager on site. Sunday brunch is a great deal with lots to choose from. Roast beef, Ham,  made to order omelets and several south of the border offerings that will please anyone. Deserts are available in sample sized portions, pies, cookies, cake etc...  if you have ever had one of their pies you know how good they are.< /Text>

Marie Callenders is a good place for some simple food, and pie of course. I ordered the New York Strip cooked medium and it came out perfect, veggies and loaded potatoes and german chocolate pie for dessert. Always a great place for comfort food.< /Review>

<Review>Friendly staff, good food at mostly reasonable prices. Having been away for several years and now back here in our favorite area it was great to revisit Marie's. The decor has not changed, we noticed most of the food items are still available. I ordered one of my favorites, the Frisco Burger. Beef Patty on grilled sourdough bread with lettuce, tomato, pickles and a pickle sauce. Soo good. Crunchy bread, burger cooked just right. I opted for a side salad instead of fries, cole slaw or fruit.
My husband had a trio, mini chicken pot pie, Caesar salad, and a slice of pie. He very much enjoyed it. I wanted to take a slice of fresh peach pie, unfortunately they had run out. But next time...
We were also lucky enough to have as our server, Renee, who was also a server there before we had left for almost 4 years.
Most likely well be back next week, I need my fresh peach pie. 😀< /Review>< Pics>

Food is actually not too bad.  The only thing about this restaurant is that it smells really bad in there.  Kinda smells moldy.
Also,  they are quite pricey.<//review>

Not a huge fan of their food. But a BIG fan of their pies. This time was Peach and Strawberry. The Banana Cream Pie has been yummy in the past.</review>

Brother and I came here today for brunch, as Hobbees had quite the wait.  As it was all you can eat, there's lots of breakfast and lunch items to choose from, plus salads, soups and desserts. Never feel like I eat $20.00 worth of food here, but it's nice to have so many choices to choose from and it's a decent meal. Love the omelette bar!</text>

To be clear, this review is solely based on my experiences ordering and picking up pies for Thanksgiving and Christmas this year.  I ordered three MC pies a few days before Thanksgiving.  I did not sit on hold for too long and the customer service was very professional and courteous.  When I arrived the day before Thanksgiving to pick them up, the parking lot was absolute chaos!  I had to park over by Michael's!  I was highly impressed to be greeted by a host at the front door and directed where to go upon my arrival.  The pickup routine was organized very well (prepaid pies go through one direction/entrance and unpaid, pre-orders through another).  Just for the pie pickups alone, it was very well staffed with clusters of employees finding the order, another retrieving your pies, and another responsible for check-out.  I actually added my Banana Cream to my order and it was no problem.  I was in and out of there in minutes, the customer service was friendly and warm, there is a board kept updated and within a central view to see what pies are available in stock if you want to add to your order.  Not to mention, all of the sides they had prepared and wrapped and priced as well!  Very smooth, very easy, in and out!  Christmas Eve was much less crowded.  I pre-ordered online which was very convenient and even if I had lost my confirmation email, they have their own copy when you check in.  I hope to find time to go in and enjoy a meal there one of these days!  Also, their pies are outstanding!  We've had pumpkin, lemon meringue, banana cream, and lemon dream...They are all fantastic!< /Text>

I look forward to your mince pies each year, but we were sadly disappointed with the one we purchased this past week. The crust was too thick and, though the mince was tasty, there was just too
little of it. It was not up to your original standard. Alas.

Well, we tried again this year: paid $20.00 for each one. The story was the same: too thick and tough crust.  Never again!!!<//Text>

<Review>A pretty good place for standard American fare, at pretty reasonable prices too, but far and away the top choice for really great pies.  That alone earns "her" a five rating, but the rest of the restaurant offerings are consistent enough and reliably tasty enough to solidly back up that rating.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Ordered a Chocolate Cream pie with whipped cream topping. They didn't have the pie with whipped cream topping.  So they scraped off the meringue of another pie and replaced it with whipped cream. The pie did not look very good after scraping off the top and trying to replace it with whipped cream. Can't understand why they would not have pies ready without the topping and add it when ordered? The pie was not very good. The crust was dry and not flaky. For the price I'll make my own from now on. Very disappointed!<//review>

The staff, while slow, were very nice, and the pies that came with our meals were great. However, the food was practically inedible, as it was way too salty or bland. The food seems to have gone downhill over the years. Might be because the place is really targeted for seniors.< /text>

Thursday is the best night to go here!
The food is good and the people are nice. The interior desperately needs a remodel and update.< /Review>

<Review>Been going to Marie Callender's for around 20 years now used to go to the Mountain View location but have been coming to this location since that one closed. Out of all the years I've been coming here have only had one mishap which I got the wrong flavor pie but came in the next day and Mark the manager was so kind and helpful and went above and beyond to correct the mistake. This is one of the last locations left in the area and I hope they stay open.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x808fb5df5e082253:0xb0e5b62315f1a615</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Wishing I'd have read the reviews before going!!  I just paid $33 for the worst meal I've ever had!
I ordered the ribs and butterfly shrimp meal, as well as the wing sampler and a slice of the New York CheeseCake for take out

The ribs were like chewing on my dogs rawhide and the shrimp were chewy pieces of rubber.  The Mashed potatoes as a side tasted like instant with cheese and onions put on top.

Good thing I decided to splurge and get wings, they were only OK, they were better than the meal but not at all worth the money

As for the Cheesecake, I can't tell you, they never bothered to put it in the bag, because I walked the 10 minutes from my hotel to get there, I was not going back.

Don't waste your money, McDonald's would be better for the price</Text>

I have a hard time finding a place that has keylime pie. I went to marie calendars. I thought to myself well  they do carry pies, I purchased a slice of keylime pie to take home. I was so disappointed.  Could barely taste the  keylime in it. Anybody out there know who carries it😥</text>

Good American restaurant with good vegetarian choice. If you like trying out salads and some American food, nice place to visit.

Staff was very friendly and patient. I will go back, if I want to try some local American food.< /text>

<Text>When I was eating there with my family, the manager turned on the TV that is in the bar. We were in the main dining room. The volume was so loud that we couldn't hear each other talk. So I asked our server to have it turned down. She returned after about 2 mins, and said no. So I went to talk with the manager. He was a jerk! He said that they would not turn it down because someone just came into the bar area and wanted it that loud. The volume was so overbearing that it ruined our meal. I said this to the manager, who again refused to turn it down, so I said that we wanted half of the cost deducted from my wife's meal because she could no longer continue eating. He gave off a very rude smirk with sigh of disgust, so I asked that he not do that. He immediately argued that he wasn't smirking, so I asked: "What? Do I have to take a photo and show you?" He replied, and I'm not exaggerating: "If you take a photo of me, I'll sue you!" Then he immediately left and went directly into the kitchen. I took photos of our bill and payment for proof, then informed the police. Needless to say, we will NEVER go back there.</Text><name>Schield T</name>< user_id>

Great salad bar and desserts. I also love their pot pies. You must have the corn bread with honey butter, it's delicious. I also like the lasagne.

I wish there were more American restaurants on the Peninsula. They seem to have disappeared once the demographics changed dramatically after the last couple of decades+. :{  Now it just seems like there are every other country represented, but only American franchises and chains. No more mom and pop restaurants. That's a real shame. As chains go, MC's is pretty good.< /Text>

<name>Bryan Horling< /name><Date>1243528072449< /Date><Rate>2< /Rate><review>We ordered some take-out dinners from Marie Callender's recently - turkey dinner, pot pie, and two kids dinners.  The presentation was pretty bad - pie was smashed, kids dinners just rolling around, potatoes/stuffing clearly served with an ice cream scoop - although some of that may be because it was take out.  None of the dinners were anything to write home about taste-wise, either.  The menu hypes the pot pie, so we were disappointed it wasn't better.

The dessert pies were better, but again not as good as one might think given how much they focus on them.  Although the regular apple pie was a little bland, the french apple was better, and the lemon meringue was good.  The kids scarfed down the chocolate pie.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

My brother bought a mince pie at the Sunnyvale Marie Callendar's, but they gave him a boysenberry pie. I'm about 40 miles from a Marie Callendar's so now I'm stuck with a pie that he paid for and I won't eat. Given the short time mince pies are available, this sucks.<//Review>

My seever was very friendly, but the food was not fresh. It took me a while to work out that the flat green slime in my sandwich was supposed to be (and perhaps once was) a pepper.

<Review>If you're coming for their desserts to take out, you won't be disappointed, however their eat-in food is not as good. I came here for a turkey dinner on Thanksgiving and it was pretty decent, so I think it's worth coming here for that if you don't have family in town.< /Review>< userid>
