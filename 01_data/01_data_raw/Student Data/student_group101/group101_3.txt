<text>So sad to learn this location will be closing. We love going here to see all the cool stuff from around the world. All the artisan crafts, rare food items from all over the world that you'd only find here, and awesome furniture at decent prices made this place a unique stop and a great place to add character to your home.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>Love the taste in decor. The store was nicely laid out, clean, and welcoming. This is my go to store for house hold things. Would be nice if they could apply military discount for us veterans and military members. Over great store. Associates were nice too.<//Review>< Pictures>

I love wandering around this place. There are so many interesting things to see. I spent a good amount of time looking at the cards because there were incredible - great quality with life-applicable greetings. I also found several that rendered me laughing out loud like a freak standing there in the aisle. Their children's books and gifts are creative, funny, and sweet. Paper products/gift wrap are crazy amazing. They've got great pottery and tableware, mix n match lamps and bases, unique pillows and rugs, delicious imported foods and sweets, a great display of international wines, and even furniture. This place is NOT BORING. Check it out, next time you're looking for.... anything.< /text>

<Text>I visit this place every once in a while with close family and friends. I always convince them to come back. The place is very well maintained, the employees are kind and I always find something new and interesting every time I visit every couple months or so. Outstanding place to browse around for goodies and unique home decorations. I wish them many years of continued excellence.</Text>< pictures>

They have home goods, candles, jewelry and personal goods such as soaps and lotions.  There is a section for foods from around the world as well as coffee and sweets.  Wonderful store for browsing and you are sure to find something special!<//Text>< user_name>

Great service & great place to shop. I am really impressed with people that work in this store and the great products they have. You can order online from many stores, but if you enjoy good service, nice smells and great browsing, then visit this store.<//text>

CostPlus was well,  CostPlus.... full of amazingly eccentric things.... but this store is closing for good and NOT opening in another location, so I'm sad for that....that's why the three stars.</text>

< Review>
I've been here many of times with my wife. This is the kind of store that you go to and you have some time and take the time to look around. We never plan to go over there to buy something in particular but it is amazing we always end up buying something. The merchandise is unique and it is fun to walk around and look at the different things from all around the world. They carry an ice line of International Foods and we always like to try something new. The staff is nice and friendly. The store even though it is filled to the brim is clean and the Isles are easily accessible.< /Review>

<review>Chris helped me and she was great.  I bought the peacock chair in black and it is FABULOUS.   I'm sitting in it right now!   I use it as at my vanity table in my bedroom and it is the PERFECT  accent .  Priced appropriately  already but it was a steal with the coupon.</review></record></dataset><record>

I like Cost Plus World Market. You can always get some unusual things here. I like a course when they have a sale cuz who doesn't like a sail! I can often find things here that I can't find at the regular supermarkets. I can find things here that she can't find out the regular types of department stores either. Sometimes they can be a little pricey, however because you're looking for some of the unusual items it's really better than having to search all over the place for those items. Although I like Amazon I do like to try to support the local businesses. So if I know they've got something here I can get it right away. It's not too much of a hassle to get there and there's plenty of parking that's free which is an important piece to me. I hate going to Downtown Sacramento celect shop the outskirts. You won't be disappointed in Cost Plus World Market as you can get some nice and usual things and then some of the usual things.</review>

parking is not easy!  robertson bustles with traffic, and a few homeless people hang near the bus stop.  the staff is friendly and keep things moving - they more than make up for it. there usually is sufficient seating.<//review>

< Review>
If you're into great coffee that you might find in places like Italy, France, and Australia go somewhere else, and support your local independent coffee shop. Starbucks does not even come close to making good coffee, for starters they over roast their coffee beans and their baristas are amatures. Honestly, I hate Starbucks and only stop if there's no other locally run small cafe close to me.</Review>

< review>
I walked into this location today at 10:30 am. I kindly asked one of the employees to provide me some water for my puppy. She said no I don't like you and I'm not giving you water. I offered her money but she refused to help me. I wanted to speak to the manager, she said my name is JASMIN and I'm a manager so you need to leave the store or I'll push you out. She was rude, disrespectful, and racist.
Another employee who was African American got evolved, and he got JASMIN'S back said we don't want to give you water and leave the store. JASMIN started to insulting and using bad words in Spanish in front of other people who were waiting for their coffee. Another employee walked into the argument and gave me a cup of water and asked me to leave the store.
The guy who was  standing next to me and waiting for his coffee walked with me to my car and told me he saw the entire horrible situation, and he firmly believe that this wouldn't happen if I was Spanish. He asked me to  call compared and report these awful people. I called corporate and complained but I don't even sure if they do anything about it.

I NEVER EVER GO TO ANY STARBUCKS EVER AGAIN. I DON'T KNOW THE WAY STARBUCKS CORPORATE TRAIN THEIR EMPLOYEES BECAUSE MOST OF THEM ARE RUDE, DISRESPECTFUL AND RACIST.
I ALONE SPEND MORE THAN $10,000.00 A YEAR ON STARBUCKS COFFEE. I HAVE COFFEE MACHIN AT HOME AND WORK, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORT U.S BASED COFFEE SHOP AND DRINK SOMETHING NICE NOT A UGLY CUP OF COFFEE WHICH HALF A CUP FAILED OUT ON THE WAY THEY THROW IT TO ME.:(<//review>

As expected.  Great service, my order was correct, busy but not extremely.
Baristas are very professional.  😊</Review>

<Review>Since the latest new manager the service quality has became really bad. I decided to boycott. My office is very close and use to go EVERYDAY an average of  $250 per month. I did talked to her and she doesn't take responsibility of the store. Many times she got there late and the employees have to solve the problems of distribution and shortness team members. I was a happy customer for 4 years, NOT ANY MORE. Juan< /Review>< Resp>

It's a starbucks.

For the 3 of you who've never been to a Starbucks. If you love coffee, stay away. If you love sugary drinks and looking normal this is the place for you. The perfect balance of being 'in' without the pressure of being labeled trendy.

Highly recommend a venti whip cream.</Text>

Refused to let me buy their overpriced coffee in order to use the restroom even though the code was right on the door, the Female manager told me to simply leave dispite my being clean and fully dressed. Don't ever come here if you believe in fair treatment for all.<//Review>

They never answer the phone. I walked in just to try it and rudeness. I did an experiment to see if what my friend stated was a fact, and sadly she was correct. Sad how rude customer service is, the social workers as well and all.</Review>

I only got to Dr khehra for my dental issues,  she is such a nice Dr. never over does anything very caring, her staff members are so polite and caring too.  Was easy to visit her during covid19. They do temperature check with all safety measures. It was a happy visit  for me.<//text>

Excellent. Friendly environment. Dr. Khera is highly experienced and focused on what’s important for healthy gums and teeth. Takes care of the patient herself and the front office and hygienists are very friendly, up front and professional. Very modern state of the art x ray machine with full 360 degree coverage.

Very ethical and affordable.  You won’t find any pressure tactics for unnecessary procedures or unnecessary fillings that some dentists may scare you with.

Highly recommended even for new patients.<//Text>

Great staff and service. Doctor was very transparent about pricing and necessary vs unnecessary dental treatments. Any questions I had were answered very clearly and honestly. A little difficult to locate at first as it is inside another build but the signage out front helps. Will be coming back as a regular patient and will recommend to friends in the area looking for dentists.</text>

<text>I went here to get cavities filled this past summer. Whole staff was extremely kind and helpful. But the bite was wrong so I had to keep going back to try to get it fixed. I now have pain on the left side of my mouth when I bite down. I can't floss on the upper right and left sides because it is too painful (even now, 2+ months after getting it done). I am no longer in the geographic area and do not have insurance anymore so I can't go get it fixed anywhere. They were super nice, but I have to say that I was not happy in the end. The pain from biting down and flossing are really pretty annoying and I am afraid I am just getting more cavities by not being able to floss.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<text>Dr. Khehra and her staff were helpful, prompt, kind and professional.  I was seen in emergency setting quickly with great results and fix of tough root canal that I had put off dealing with until it got bad. In addition to Dr. Khehra i saw Dr Ansari and both are excellent and I recommend both highly.  I have unfortunately needed a bunch of dental work and these people are the best i have ever been to.<//text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x808fcc0eed7dded9:0x1ba6ebca3674d8d0< /gmap_id></record>

<Text>Pros: 1.) All three reps i talked to during the course of my rental were very friendly, helpful, and willing to do their best in serving me, 2.) No mechanical or electrical issues with the rental car. Cons: 1.) Total amount was more than the quoted reservation rate, 2.) First car i was put in had expired registration, 3.) Second car i was put in did not have registration paperwork in the vehicle.<//Text><user_name>Robert M.003</user_name><date>1622431130238<//date>< GmapID>

<Review>I was in a car accident searching desperately for the right rate and car. This location went over and beyond to make sure I had what I needed.  Not only did they assist me with a car rental that was sanitized, clean from debris, and smoke free; they also provided exceptional customer service!!! I absolutely recommend this location if you are looking for quality and staff who are friendly, professional, and patient to meet your car rental needs.</Review></record>

<text>Enterprise Rent-A-Car vehicles are newer, better cared for and much cleaner. We rented from this Hertz location today and disappointed in the quality of vehicles available, overall cleanliness and engine of the vehicle rented to us was poor, first time and likely last time renting at Hertz. Would have been better utilizing our own personal vehicle or staying with Enterprise Rent-A-Car do to you having a feeling like the vehicle renter was not as safe do to vehicle performance. Unfortunately where on a short time clock, but will call and see if they can give us something different as were unhappy with the selections and overall Hertz vehicle provided.< /text>< Pics>

They told me to wait because they were going to clean it, and they'd call me when its ready. I never recieved a call. After 4 hours, i called them to find out what happened, and they put me on hold for 15 minutes, just to let me know that it wouldn't be available until after 3 pm.

<text>I had a terrible experience at this location. I was in town vising from the east coast. I had a completely packed schedule. When I tried to pay they did not accept my debit card as a valid form of payment neither was cash. This is the same debit card I used at Hertz on my last trip where I spent a large amount of money and there was no issue. They said I needed a credit card to get my car. When I told them that neither me or my wife own a credit card they said they could run a credit check and see if my debit card could be used. After they ran the credit check the did not allow me to use a debit card. I pulled my credit report and was surprised to see my credit score was very high. IDK how good credit has to be to use a debit card for a 3 day rental but  no one at Hertz could tell me. The manager told me to call customer service and CS routed me right back to the store I was in. Long story short I had to ask my wife to come down ($20 Uber) and try her debit card (Exact same account as me) and it worked. No explanation but  we just left. The car was fine and in good condition but the lack of care was unacceptable. I will not use Hertz again because of the lack of follow up after I filed an official compliant. The unhelpful manager's name is Patty. Don't trust Patty!< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<rate>2<//rate><Text>Pretty unprofessional staff. My insurance connected me with them and the man on the phone says, “what can I help you with?” I say, “my insurance connected me to you.” He says, “oh yeah. What size car do you need?” I say, “ whatever my insurance pays for.” To which he says, “oh yeah, ok, a Ford Edge.”  He says it will be ready in 30-60 minutes. Two hours later I get it, and the interior has sticky substances everywhere and someone’s personal hair trimmer! The staff was rude and it appears that a dozen people work in the back, but only one works out front. Sad.</Text>< Pictures>

Worst customer service ever. Even though it is more convenient, I will go to the airport to pick up a car before I go back there. Here is just 1 example of the cluster that is this location: I reserved a car with Sirius radio. Even though I reserved the car in advance, when I got there I was told there were no cars with Sirius radio.  Whatever. I told the agent that I  had already paid for Sirius radio to which the genius asks "Do you want me to remove the charge." Yup, can't make that up.</text>

I just wanna say a huge thank you to Dinho Miller! He put up with my picky self and went above and beyond to get me the rental car I wanted. Plus, he made sure that I didn’t have to pay a ridiculously high security deposit, instead he found a way to drop it from $200 to $50 which is a HUGE difference! He was super awesome to deal with, professional, and the process was easy (on my end lol). Very clean location as well. This guy deserves a raise.< /review>

My experience was at Hertz was plain cold and insulting. To start, the person who was supposed to take me from the body shop to the rental agency was not pleasant, barely spoke, The only positive thing he did was help me with one of my child booster seats (they were to be transferred to the rental car, so my daughters can ride as passengers).

I was sat down and told he would be back to help me. Another associate was sitting, not taking any clients. Several customers walked in, she helped them, and I was left waiting -no acknowledgement of my wait nor were there any other reassurances. The associate who drove me to the rental agency was never to be seen after that.

I pleaded with the associate still there, she initially refused, saying the other associate would be back "he said he would be back, don't you remember?" -we're her words.

25 minutes later I pleaded with her again, she then explained the one who drove me was washing the car that I was to rent. No one asked me what car I wanted, my insurance covers the 55 dollar insurance rate, and they had chosen a car for me without my permission (the smallest car available, Nissan Versa).

I explained that I never chose a car and that I desired a car at the 55 dollar insurance rate (I pay a higher insurance premium for this). They said they had no other cars. As she said that a gentleman was returning an SUV and said it's clean and ready for me if I wanted it. Had I been asked, that would have been my request. The associate then said to wait, she checked in his car, and told me "you're getting a Dodge Journey, this car is reserved". At this point I have been waiting for over an hour, and I feel I'm being strong armed into this rental. The only reason I continued to wait was that I had familial obligations that had to be met, and I couldn't go through this process somewhere else.

The owner/manager comes in and realizes what is going on and finally begins to begin my rental agreement (for the Dodge Journey that I never chose). Due to my time constraints (after waiting there nearly two hours) they were unable to wash the car (I would have had to wait longer, and I was in desperate need to get back to my kids), and to expedite things, the owner/manager began to answer questions related to the rental agreement -some without my permission (ex. filling out the survey questionnaire with positive praise -as if it were me- I found this out when I read the rental contract).

Ultimately I was given a 36 dollar a day car when my allotment from my insurance company was and is 55 dollars a day. Toward the end of my rental I had my drop off location changed over the phone with Hertz so I would never have to see those people again. I will never go back to Hertz again and I was repeatedly mistreated and insulted by people who work at this location. This experience was absolutely unacceptable. For management to choose individuals with such poor interpersonal communication skills to work for Hertz is only a reflection of the manager/owner's poor judge of character. I will forward this to my insurance company and body shop in hopes that they use another rental agency. Avoid this place.< /Text>

<text>Rented through state farm insurance.  There were 5 people waiting with only one customer service person and you could clearly hear conversation going on in the back room.  When we did get helped everything went smooth but I felt we were getting asked strange questions like what was our budget for the rental and what happened to our car.  Maybe it was the state farm connection or maybe she thought she was making conversation but really we just wanted to get in and out quickly, not make friends.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Don't go here because they've got terrible customer service. I called 4849498 and couldn't get any info. A 34 second phone call with nothing but "we close in 40 minutes" and "I'll call you right back."

I called them 35 minutes later, livid because I walked a mile in the wrong direction to a falsely listed location on 9th street because they couldn't take the time to answer a couple of questions or even call me back.

What did they tell me when I called them again? "We'll call you right back." I never heard back from them.

Enterprise was busy too, but they managed to take the time to help me, so they got my business and they'll get it again in the future.

I will never use Hertz now, and I can only hope this review costs them even more money.< /Review>

<review>Edit: we have been in the rental car for almost a month, they stepped up their game when it came to the car.  they replaced the initial car with another one.  still had some staining on the rear seat, but nothing near what the first had.  the service after the first was far better, and more in tune with what we needed.  Can't say that it didn't have anything to do with my intitial impression and review here.

Jordan

Initial:

We needed a rental car because our car was in the shop.  The dealership is paying for the car at Hertz, so we were stuck with that decision.  We arrived at the location, 1 person was working at the front desk, and multiple people were heard in the background.  Upon walking into the door, the Lady at the desk asked us if we had an appointment, which my wife had made an hour prior, she yelled to the back, "Your appointment for the dealer car is here", and the lady in the back yelled back, "you take care of her."  The waiting area proceded to get busy, approximately 5 guests waiting and only 1 person up front.  Which is when 2 people from the back came up to assist.  The customer service by the people working at the desk was only problem 1.

Wife brings home the car, as I had to leave to go to work, and it is pretty filthy.  The exterior was not clean, and the interior had stains on all of the seats, and trash strewn about, in cupholders, and in the door's.  I expected more out of a car rental place, but I will guarantee that if it involves paying more, Hertz lost my family's business.

Has anyone else tried to call the 800 number to complain, or send an email using the broken link on the Hertz website?  I tried both, and got nothing.< /review>< Pics>

Order ahead! There’s two lines and they both can get pretty long but planning ahead does get you in and out quicker. I don’t think you can go wrong with any of the bun options. We love the classic but have had most of the variants and they’re all equally fresh and tasty. Just try not to eat them all before your get home!< /Review>

Cash only. Pineapple buns are a Hong Kong food, pineapple referring to the design of the topping on the bun. So don't come expecting pineapple flavored buns. However, these buns are DELICIOUS. They have every option under the sun (bbq pork, pizza, plain, with butter) and they are all sweet, delicious and cheap. The butter buns come with A SLAB of butter. Yum!<//Review>

I was curious about Pineapple King Bakery so decided to try a couple of things. I got the match and mango puffs and the black sesame bun. They were all delicious! Personally I prefer the puffs because they're lighter and the custard cream is delicious.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<rating>5< /rating><text>The first time I've tasted a pineapple bun was at this place. I've never heard of it before so I really thought it had pineapples in it. So, during my first trip, I bought one pineapple bun. When I got home, I bit into it and immediately had to tell someone how good it was!

Since I live quite far from here, I've been searching everywhere for pineapple buns and have been disappointed... The reason was because I realized pineapple bun was just a sweet bread. What I had gotten at Pineapple King Bakery was a pineapple bun with custard. I highly highly recommend it! Once I realized my mistake, I made it a quest to go there and buy as many as I can because I couldn't find it anywhere else. So this was my second trip; I bought 2 pineapple buns with custard, a pineapple bun with red bean and one with pineapple.
The one with custard is a very popular item and sells pretty quick.

So, if you don't know what a pineapple bun is, it's usually sweet bun in which the top is scored like a pineapple. The top of it looks like the skin of a pineapple.

The workers are super nice and efficient.
Since this is a small store, there are no restrooms, but there is one really close by at the Golden Gate Park in case you need one.

Overall, I would definitely keep coming back for these buns and the egg tarts :D< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDOu2UVQwZNwBifK3Yo0i6kFzCwTHHcmAD-XgZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFG21OISXZBw2QP9fiOgaiuL3nkRtOP8PGuSJn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

You tell them your order and they box it all for you.  Ordered 2 pineapple custard buns, 2 butter pineapple buns, 2 cocktail buns, 2 ham and egg buns, 1 bacon and egg bun and a chrysanthemum drink. Total was $18. Bread is super soft and tasty! C tea was just the right amount of sweet and very refreshing on a hot day. Theres no ice in it. My favorite is the butter buns, :). Also I believe its cash only.< /Review>< name>

Yummy stuff, tons of options, overall good stuff but cash only place. We bought about $20 worth of items that kept us full throughout the day. Recs: porkfloss, pineapple bbq bun, portuguese egg custard. We’ll definitely be back!<//Text>

While their pineapple bun is okay, I mean it's nothing special, the rest of their stuff is bordering bad. I had such high hopes for this place. I'm a fan of asian pastries and so when I found myself in the area, I made sure to check them out. Their filling to bread ratio is absurd. Only one tiny portion of the chicken filling made it into my bun. Their "spam" and egg had a weird aftertaste. Didn't taste like spam at all. I would say this place is overrated.</text>

Was craving a pineapple bun with butter and saw this place offered it. I was missing Hong Kong and wasnt aware bakeries here offered the slab of butter in pineapple buns. I was super excited to try it and order some other buns as well. I ordered online and picked it up in-store. Inside is a really small bakery, but you can also pick buns inside. They put the butter in when I got there so it wouldnt melt before I got there and i was extremely impressed. The butter was huge and definitely reminded me of Hong Kong. Their plain pineapple buns are just as good. I like their spam and egg, but it does come with a lot of mayonnaise. They have other cool buns like mango pineapple buns or matcha pineapple buns. Id love to try them in the future.<//Review>

These buns are sooo goood!!! I finally gave it a try after seeing them all over Instagram. I got two pineapple buns and two ube pineapple buns. I thought they pineapple bun would have a filling, but it was just bread inside with the crumble on top. The ube bun was my favorite of the two. It had an even layer of filling and was such a fun purple color. My grandma really liked the ube bun too and she’s the ube halaya queen. I’ll definitely come back and I’ll BRING CASH! They are cash only and I didn’t realize this until I was at the front of the line. Parking is easy enough in the area. There’s a paid lot right across the street with decent pricing.</review>

** During Quarantine Review **

I was casually browsing my yelp app when I saw this cute bakery just a block away. With the high ratings and limited open food options available we decided to check it out. On our visit there was a small line that formed just outside the store, but it moved very quickly.

The menu was pretty confusing and lengthy. I really had no idea what to order, but the customer in front of me said that the butter pineapple bun was the most popular and recommended the deluxe box, so we went ahead and ordered that.

My friend and I split everything and here's our verdict

I really like the pineapple bun! It has a nice sweet crusty flavor; however, my some fillings were better than others. The butter (orginal) was very lackluster to me. It tasted like the individual butter packs that you get at the diner to slather in the dinner rolls. It didn't add anything in my opinion. The matcha and custard fillings on the other-hand had that perfect amount of sweetness. The mango was way too overpowering.

Now that I know what pineapple buns taste like I think on my next visit I'll know what to order. I'd love to try the ube and I'm super curious about trying some of their savory options like spam and bbq pork. Stick to the asian flavors and you won't be disappointed!< /review>

Hidden gem in the area they have amazing pineapple cream buns I particularly enjoyed the matcha cream. It's only $1.60 for two buns super great value! They have different breads as well from sweet to savory!  The pork buns are worth checking out as well!

They only take cash so make sure you have some before you get there.

They also do phone orders if you're ordering large orders for parties. Service is pretty quick if it's an empty shop but if there's a line prepared to wait about 5-10 minutes extra, but overall it's a pretty quick in and out trip.

There's no tables here to enjoy your treats unfortunately. There is also no bathroom here either .< /Text>

I got the pineapple bun with butter and its 5 stars. Loved it. I also got the white rabbit candy bun and its was soo good. No to overly sweet. Just the right amount of filling. Bad part is I'm not a local otherwise this would be my weekly stop. I also got the bacon , cheese, egg sandwich which  was good. Wished it was served hot and no mayo..< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>Self service. Grab a tray and some tongs and pick the buns you would like and then bring them up to the counter to get rung up.

I really appreciated the Coconut Creme Bun and the Pineapple Red Bean Bun. These cost about $1.30 with tax included.

If you need something more filling, they have buns with ham and egg, ham and cheese, bacon, etc.

They also have tea and coffee available for purchase.<//Review>< pics>

The bun texture is absolutely perfect! We tried a variety and my favorite was the red bean twist bun. We also got mooncakes. The durian ones were weirdly mushy. In the picture you can see how the outer crust has a soggy look. It was not enjoyable, though the durian inside flavor was good, it was also not a firm paste like a mooncake should be.< /Review>

Love this place - their pineapple bun toast were the BEST in the Bay Area! It’s a small bakery so expect to eat outside, you must eat it at the store otherwise it’s not as good. Try the HK milk tea as well — very authentic.</review>

Decided to come by here because the flavored pineapple buns I saw were really interesting. They have other buns that is really cheap and worth getting like your average Chinese bakery. They even have a combo meal where you can get certain buns and a drink for around $4ish. My husband got the combo meal B which has Milk Tea, spam & egg bun, and mini pineapple bun. We didn't really enjoy the milk tea as much maybe we were use to a more smoother taste from NY. The spam and egg bun was really good. I ordered the Pineapple matcha bun and the pineapple lychee bun. I really enjoy both the buns. I can taste the flavors if you keep eating and really sit and try to taste the fillings, but I wish both the matcha and the lychee had a little bit more flavor. Overall, it was pretty decent and definitely a cheap eats place.</Text>

I had the matcha green tea cake, which was especially spongy and delicious, since there were no crumbs when eating. My children got the pineapple taro bun and both enjoyed it. The only downside is that they only accept cash.</text>

That pineapple bum was the most amazing I have tried. Crispy and warm outside, cold and buttery inside.
A little bit greasy but it’s so tasty.< /Review>

I have to say, it is very difficult to find a good pineapple bun in HK nowadays. Thanks God for Pineapple King. Their buns (yes, all of the other varieties as well) are just like the way they used to make it. For the best possible buns, come at 7:30 am when all the buns are rolling off the oven. Couple with their equally good HK milk tea.... I especially recommend all of their pineapple buns will filling. They are all amazing!<//Review>< Resp>

I admit that I am addicted to this place. I officially go here every time I visit the Sunset district. It sounds like a terrible idea but you should get their butter pineapple bun. They heat up the bun and lodge a thick slab of butter. Again it sounds gross but it is amazing and something you should try at least once if you visit.< /review>

There is a good variety of items here, and reasonably priced. There's not really any service here since it's get it yourself and pay.

I'm not really into most of the items, but I tried a red bean cookie, egg tart, and mochi with custard. The mochi one was good, not too much filling. The egg tart was a little on the dry side but still flaky, and the red bean cookie was pretty dry.< /text>

<Review>I love this cute bakery! They have a great selection of teasty pestries and delicious savories, for very affordable prices. My favorites are the pork bun and the couconat bun - both are absolutely awesome!  :)<//Review></record>

Really liked the mochi egg custard pastry. Spam and egg bun also very good. Cash only!! Very good prices so you don't need to bring a lot.</text>

Very good salted egg yolk pastry. The skin was not the tenderest, but the filling had plenty of salted egg yolk with a matching amount of lotus paste and the pastry was very inexpensive.<//text>

As a Hong Kong local, I maintain that this Hong Kong style bakery bakes bread that beats most Hong Kong bakeries. They reheat bread on request. Their pineapple bun is indeed the best, with a crispy topping atop a soft bun. All their breads are however, superb. Their pastries are also excellent - the taro pastry has just the right amount of sweetness to bring out the taro flavour. And to top this all off is their Hong Kong milk tea, especially when made by Ivy, beats ALL Hong Kong milk tea places. The tea is stronger than expresso coffee, smooth and is perfectly sweet at regular sweetness. I'd go every day if cholesterol wasn't a concern.</Text>

<review>They have a good variety of items , this is a cash only place . But due to the prices being so inexpensive , a little cash goes a long way .  The original and matcha pineapple buns are simply amazing . One of the best items I tried and not sure if anyone else has them, are the Pan fried mochi w/custard and BBQ beef . They are not available till after 10am so if you go early they will not be available . Very small bakery and no place to sit and enjoy your food . But it is worth getting items from here .</review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x808587657d6e6007:0xbf8260323811d52a</gmap_id></record>

The matcha puffs are so good!! 10/10 would recommend!

Tried some other stuff which was pretty meh to be honest. Just get the matcha puffs (or original works too) and be happy.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) The most famous pineapple oil bag in this place does not have dine-in food in it, but can only be used for takeaway.The price is expensive, I think it is average.

(Original)
這處最出名嘅菠蘿油包,裏面沒有堂食,只能做外賣,價錢方面都算貴,我感覺到是一般.<//text>

Nice place to have an event! The indoor hall is a pretty spacious, with a big bar area and kitche. The outdoor is awesome. Really huge lot of grass for kids to run everywhere and space for everyone to sit and enjoy the party.  It was my first time @the Hall hope to be back soon for another party lol 🍺🌅🔥✌</text>

My little cousin had her 15 here. The venue gets the job done. It's not ugly. What ruins this place is the security. When your guest are entering they make you stop and look inside your car to see how many people are in the car. I've never been to a venue who does that. After the last song they were forcing us out. There were still people there and they were just throwing them out. Mind you we had a ton of stuff to load up and they are trying to rush us. I would never book this place. Finally when everything was loaded we had to drive outside the gate to figure out where my uncle wanted the stuff to go. They just shut the gate.< /Review>

I rarely post reviews for products online as I'm seldom impressed with a product enough to do so.  However, in this instance I feel compelled to shout this one from the rooftops!  I am the full time caregiver for my 64 spouse who I've been married to for 46 years.  She has Type II diabetes among other serious maladies, but her blood sugar drops dangerously low without warning, often in her sleep.  With the new Libre II device monitoring her levels in real time and sounding the alarm, we are able to promptly react before she goes into hypoglycemic shock.  Just as amazing is the predictive nature of the device that forecasts rising or falling trends of her lab values thus allowing us to adjust diet and other factors resulting using less insulin.  It is a game changer for us!  Finally, we are so grateful to Advanced Diabetes Supply for guiding us through the process of obtaining the device, coordinating medical records, insurance company requirements and keeping us posted every step of the way!  We dealt with a person by the name of Izzy who was professional, compassionate and kind. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.  Please feel free to use any or all of this review.

ADS contacted me by email notifying me I was due to get my prescription refilled. It was simple, I replied to the email according to their instructions and that was it. My prescription arrived a couple days later in perfect time. I appreciate ADS and their easy support.<//review>

<Text>Service has been excellent.  The phone people are responsive and do what they promise to do. I’ve been using them for nearly a year, and on only one occasion, was there a delay in getting back to me.  They answer all of my questions and never make me feel that I am bothering them, even if sometimes I am sure I must be.<//Text>< Time>

Absolutely terrible service. Not only is the phone wait time incredibly long, their suggested use of their voicemail takes no less than 24 hours and usually longer to get back to you.
I have been having an issue with my transmitter that (for some reason) was not sent with my sensor supplies. After 7 phone calls (and counting), I have still not received it. At each phone call, one issue is apparently addressed, but other issues are not. Then, I as the customer, have to continuously follow up to find out why I still haven't received my transmitter. Then another issue comes up that has to be addressed. Today my transmitter finally died so I'm back to finger sticks. I have been "guaranteed" that it was going to arrive several days ago, but still no transmitter. As a physician, my staff and I deal with various medical and medical supply companies, Advanced Diabetes Supply has been the worst experience I've had in 30+ years of practicing medicine. I spoke with my endocrinologist and she has stated that several of her other patients are having similar issues.< /Review>

{'time': 1622129908970, 'text': 'Greetings Pablo –\n\nFirstly, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience you have experienced with our service. We appreciate your feedback and we investigate every review thoroughly to enhance our customer service to meet our patient’s needs.\n\nFor your initial order with us on 04/09/21, we received a transferred prescription. Our representative confirmed your order to be shipped which you authorized only sensors to be sent because you did not need a receiver or transmitter at that time. On 05/05/21, you contacted us to ship a transmitter however the transferred prescription we received for your initial order had just expired.  We reached out to your provider to obtain a valid prescription and confirmed your order. Unfortunately, we made an error with calculating your copay causing a delay with your transmitter order.  Upon identifying our error, we expedited your order to ship next day and tracking confirms your order was delivered yesterday.\n\nYour next eligible order for sensors will be available on 07/08/21 and your transmitter order will be available on 11/22/21.  We are actively seeking to grow our staff to better assist with connecting to our patients quicker over the phone.  You may also email us at customercare@northcoastmed.com and we can reach back out to you after reviewing your account.  Again, we sincerely apologize for the delay and appreciate you choosing ADS for your testing needs.\n\nPlease reach out should you require anything additional.'}</response>

Since using the Freestyle Libre 2 from ADS, it has changed my blood sugar ups and downs. Went from 7.6 to 6.5. Can see where I am at at anytime and can adjust. ADS has made it super easy to get my supplies, and reordering is a breeze! So glad I am able to work with them.<//text>

<review>This company lacks an ability to maintain records for refills on diabetic supplies and fails to ship in a timely manner with the claim that the insurance will not allow for processing shipments to ensure items are delivered.  Their hours of operation are limiting for folks who live in the Central or Eastern time zones.  So tired of having to chase down my husband's diabetic (CGM) supplies when promises have been made that they will be responsible for filling refills.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Companies can't survive on poor service.

I started using ADS for my Libre sensors about 4 years ago. The first sensors were 10 day sensors at first, and now they are 14 day sensors, and better now the sensor Reader will alert one to either low or high glucose day or nite!
The service provided by Advanced Diabetes Supply has been great all of these 4 years! They have been there for me whenever I have need them. I would refer them to anyone along with the Libre sensors!< /review>

<review>I have written 0 reviews ever. This company is horrible.

Dexcom recently switched their resupply provider over to this company. It has taken over two months for me to receive my products, and I am still waiting!!! They don't pick up phone calls, they don't return calls, they don't send out follow up emails.

If you are presented with the opportunity to work with ADS, say no and ask for an alternative.</review><Gmap_id>0x80dc749f6002c2b3:0xe3458b1592fae094</Gmap_id>< response>

This is a HORRIBLE, unreliable supply company.  I would tell anyone that is considering using this company, STAY AWAY!  It is not like our supplies are optional, they are the difference between life and death.  I  have now switched back to Byram!

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>I can't even begin to express my frustration at the incompetence of ADS. Case in point: In January 2021, I called them to update our new insurance. Diabetes supplies were not due to be refilled until March, so this gave them plenty of time.

On March 2, 2021, they sent their form text asking for authorization to ship and charge the card on file. I authorized it.

On March 12, 2021, I received an email from ADS, asking for the exact same authorization. I gave it, and asked why they were emailing when they texted for the same authorization ten days earlier.

On March 23, 2021, I called ADS to find out what was going on, because supplies were about to run out. I had to wait on hold for over TWO HOURS before I finally got to speak to someone, and they couldn't figure out what was wrong with the order.

On March 24, 2021, they called me on the phone to say that they had run the insurance verification TO THE WRONG INSURANCE. Yes, they had the correct insurance on file from when I updated it back in January, but they didn't use that one; they used the previous insurance. So now they had to run a NEW insurance verification. They assured me they'd put a rush order on it, so it should be back within a couple of days. I gave my authorization at that time for them to immediately ship it, once the verification was back.

On April 15, 2021, they called me to say that the insurance verification JUST came back (???) but wouldn't authorize a 90-day supply, which we've had for over a year. They didn't offer to send one month's supply. They didn't offer anything. Just a phone number if I wanted to call them back.

I called back, waited on hold several minutes, and left a voice message. With their track record, it could be days or weeks before I hear from them again, and meanwhile diabetes supplies have run out.</Text>< Pics>

<Review>Very poor service. It takes forever to reach someone on the phone; they say they will call back and never do.  The personnel are very  pleasant when you speak with them but there is a huge disconnect then between ordering and receiving supplies at ADS. Seems like they need a total reorganization to gain some efficiency when they are dealing with such essential products<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<text>I wish I could give negative stars because this is the worst place I have dealt with in ordering diabetic supplies. First off it took an entire month to receive my Dexcom G6 order, 2 weeks into that when I called them to see what's going on, they claimed they were waiting on my medical records, even though they never said they needed them. Took another 2 weeks before they finally processed the order. They told me I would get a 3 month supply of sensors, and even said the dollar amount it would be, but when it shipped the invoice only had one box of sensors (one month) and I was only charged for a one month supply. When I called them again they said there was an error on their end with the order, but they wouldn't let me get the other two months until the first month ran out, and they would contact me at the end of the first month. Of course the month came and went and heard crickets from them. When I called them about the next order they said it would be at least another 10 day wait before they could fill again, even though I was already out of sensors. Fortunately I've found a pharmacy locally to handle my Dexcom orders now, and not have to deal with this nightmare. Judging by many other recent reviews, I'm not the only one with problems with this place.  Avoid this place if at all possible, I can't imagine dealing with this with insulin pump supplies since those are more important.<//text><user_id>111927806501659497797<//user_id><gmap_id>0x80dc749f6002c2b3:0xe3458b1592fae094< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

VERY poor follow-through, VERY poor communication, VERY slow shipping of products. I understand that people are working remotely due to COVID, but if more than a year into the pandemic your business hasn't figured out how to communicate information even amongst co-workers in order to meet the needs of clients, the business is a failure. If you can find a covered supplier closer to home, I would recommend trying some place else.</text>

I have called three times on May 3. I followed their direction on the phone to hold my place in line and they would call back. Only time they called was at 12:33 and I was hung up on. I called right back and received the same message to press one and customer service would get back to me. No word from company so y called back and left a voice mail telling them I am not happy. I think people should contact their insurance.<//review>

Insurance authorization on file since 4/7 I have yet to hear from this mediocre company after multiple calls. Hold times are ridiculous and when someone answers they keep saying authorization needs to be verified, even after I told them I am out of sensors and transmiter. Working with my insurance now to get Dexcom supplies elsewhere since this company is a joke!< /Review></record>

<Review>My daughter has been forced to transition to this vendor after being with Dexcom.  They never contacted me and I have gotten the run around from them for almost two months!  At first they needed an authorized, then a signed prescription, then a more clearly signed prescription, then my daughters medical chart notes, then a new letter with the number of sensors rather than days.  I have bent over backwards getting them everything they have continued to request and here we are two months into this and we still have NO Dexcom.  I keep calling and still have not received the equipment we need.  Worst experience ever!  Kid's shouldn't be forced to go without when we ha e insurance and have even offered to pay in advance.  It's RIDICULOUS!!< /Review><pics>None< /pics></record></dataset><record>

Absolute worst service I have experienced in trying to receive needed Dexcom supplies.  I do not understand how this company can continue to exist.  I have called 8 times during business hours, left countless voicemails and requested a call back.  Once they called and didn't even let the phone ring a full one ring before hanging up.  I had the phone right beside me so I would not miss their call.  I am now calling Dexcom and going to beg them for a transmitter.  This company should be out of business.<//text>

Noone ever answers the phone! This is my third month on the dexcom and for the last 2 months I get the refill text... and... I reply following the instructions and nothing! I call everyday sometimes on hold for hours.. Noone answers! I leave voice mail fir a call back - Nothing ever! Then on my last day of the dexcom I drive an hour to my endo so they can call and get through some how and ADS ships to me 3 days later... But my dexcom already expired! ..... Hands down the worst company ever! Save yourself aggravation and fund another supplier< /Text>

< Review>
We have received dexcom supplies from this company for last 10 years, the last few years progressively worse service. At this point I need to review to warn those trying to decide what company to go with, AVOID this company if you have any other options. They do not follow through with obtaining auths, never give an update if order delayed, I have to call and harass every time we need an order filled to get them to work on it. Takes 45 mins on hold to get some clueless customer service agent to answer and tell me they are short staffed and "sorry looks like no one started the authorization" from 1 month ago!<//Review>

UPDATE: I ended up waiting 1:54:55 before speaking with someone in the Dexcom intake department. Unacceptable.

It is entirely unacceptable to wait on hold for 1:46:24 and counting to talk to the intake department! I am absolutely furious at how unprepared this company is to handle any Dexcom orders! Not having supplies literally endangers the lives of diabetics and this company can’t be bothered to staff their call center with enough people! I have better things to be doing other than waiting on hold for two hours or more!<//text>

This company is really bad at sending prescription refills.  They will wait until the last possible day to send supplies and they just told me that it was their bad for not sending my refills after 90 days, and that they didn't even send communication to notify they weren't sending them automatically.   They pretty much suck.  Just avoid them</review>

Awful. Slow, uncoordinated, lazy, ignorant... You get the idea.  If you want to wait for supplies for a month and deal with an hour wait on the phone every time you call while they give you the runaround, look no further than this company!</Review>

I’ve been promised multiple times I’d be called back regarding my bill they say is overdue but not once have I received a call back.

<review>**FINAL UPDATE**
At first, I was very unhappy with ADS customer service for the reasons below. However, ADS was extremely proactive in remedying the situation and now I am extremely satisfied. As soon as my insurance approved the authorization, ADS got my order ready and out the door. I believe that my initial experience was not representative of ADS as a whole and I applaud their customer service department for going above and beyond to make sure I could get my supplies as fast as possible.

**UPDATE**
So, I'm actually really impressed with ADS customer service! Less than one day after I posted the original review, a rep contacted me and helped me get everything sorted out. It turns out we do need some more paperwork (which I found a little frustrating, because I was told multiple times by multiple reps that they had all the paperwork necessary and all I had to do was wait), but hopefully that was the last of the miscommunication. They also apologized for the lack of communication on behalf of the company and even offered to overnight me some testing materials so that I can check my blood sugars in the meantime. This interaction makes me hopeful that my previous experience with ADS was not representative of their customer service. I don't like leaving bad reviews on yelp, but I think that a company that deals with life-saving medical supplies should be held to a higher standard than say, a coffee shop. I will update this review hopefully just one more time after everything works out and I actually get my G6 system!

I've been trying to get on the Dexcom G6 and my experience with Advanced Diabetes Supply has extremely been frustrating. The process of getting the supplies I need has been delayed multiple times because different reps keep giving me the wrong information. They even sent a text message that an authorization had been submitted, but when I called to check in, it actually had not been submitted. To their credit, every rep I spoke to has been very friendly. My experience is detailed below:

ADS: "We spoke with your doctor's office yesterday, we have all the paperwork, and everything looks good. We'll give you a call when things are ready."

Me: *calls to check in two weeks later*

ADS: "Actually, we need your doctor's office to send us a form so we can send it to your insurance. After we get that, it'll take about a week for your insurance to approve it."

Me: ??? then why did you tell me everything was good and have me wait two weeks for nothing??? *Has doctor submit necessary paperwork in less than one day. calls ADS to check in a week later."

ADS: "Yes, we have all the paperwork and we just have to submit an authorization to your insurance. I'll submit it now, check back in a few days."

**They actually sent me a text message which states that the authorization was submitted as urgent and everything should be approved in about a week.

Me: *calls back a few days later to check AGAIN*

ADS: "Your authorization hasn't been submitted.... Yes, I see that someone sent you that text message, but they didn't actually submit the authorization. I'll submit it now and everything should be ready in about a week."

Me: ??????? Your company literally sent me a text message that my authorization had been submitted as "URGENT" and that I would only have to wait another week. Now my process of waiting a week is starting over??

Extremely frustrating... will be calling back tomorrow to see if they actually submitted the authorization.<//review>< Pics>

<rating>1</rating><Review>They were good for the first three years getting supplies from them but this past year and a half they have become so frustrating and useless. I have to call them all the time to make sure my supplies are not delayed and they process insurance on time. If I left it up to them all my shipments would be delayed weeks or months and with a CGM, especially pregnant, that is NOT OKAY. That affects my health and my babies. Their laziness and lack of organization is not something that should affect my health. Each time I call i get told something else by a different person. I have had the same insurance, doctor, and prescription for almost five years now. The only thing that has gotten worse is them and how they handle their customers.< /Review>< pics>

This company is absolutely terrible . My daughter is Type 1 diabetic and has a prescription for sensors. She has no symptoms of low blood sugars and has had several lows during the day and middle of the night that we would not have been aware of except for her sensors.We have a great doctors office and great insurance. We never have any issue getting supplies or prescriptions EXCEPT with this company. Do Not use this company if you need to have your diabetes supplies sent on time. I have tried to give them chance after chance for over a year with her supplies and it is ALWAYS something and my daughter ends up going without her supplies for days up to weeks at a time<//Review>

<Text>Wish I could give zero stars.  I ran out of transmitters and called for a new prescription.  I paid extra to overnight it.  They sent it ground.  It's been four days and counting that I've had no transmitters.  I called to complain and was told it's "out of their hands."  I asked to speak to a manager and was told that the leads were "in a meeting."  Very convenient.  I'm switching suppliers today.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc749f6002c2b3:0xe3458b1592fae094</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I switched to ADS after my previous supplier suddenly quit doing business. It was a fairly smooth transition with a few bumps that we got through ok.
It's a little challenging reaching   customers service but once I reach them, they are very responsive .</Text>

I would give them zero stars. They were supposed to send my son's glucose sensors 9 days ago. They have an issue with the prescription, according to them. The doctor's office called them right away, the person from Medical left 2 messages to talk to the supervisor, I have called so many times and I still don't know if they have fixed it or not. Meanwhile, my son has been out of sensors for many days. Very frustrating. I hope Medical change to a different pharmacy. 9 days already since they should have shipped them!!< /Text>

<Text>I would give them no starts if possible. the bad reviews here say it all, long call wait times, give you the run around each time you need new supplies asking for multiple verifications via email, text and call. Completely inefficient and painful to deal with as a customer. the worst experience i have with any company.</Text>< Pics>

<Review>I have talked with a couple of customer service reps that are polite and very accommodating.
Most if the time I can't get through to anyone to answer my calls and then when my call is returned I miss the call because I am hard of hearing.  The fact I didn't answer my return calls was a complaint to me.  This person hadn't done any research on my account to see a problem before she began leaving a message and then she realized while leaving this message I had also sent an e-mail that  my order was late she said, " Oh I see the order is late.  I can send it out right away."
I'm happy she sent it out but it seems getting most of my orders is a hassle.  I would really like to know why in writing so if it is the doctors office I could have something to show them to let them know what the problem is.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc749f6002c2b3:0xe3458b1592fae094<//Gmap_id></record>

<review>As a former employee and diabetic ~ I would leave a zero if I could. This diabetes supply company not only refused to accommodate my diabetes during the COVID-10 pandemic, THEIR DIABETIC EMPLOYEE AT THE DIABETIC SUPPLY PROVIDER, they failed to notify me they had gathered my things and 'lost' them irretrievably. Garbage place to work and questionable service from an insider perspective.</review>< Pictures>

This disappointing, if not dismal, supplier has been slow in shipping my wife's supplies, I am the insurance holder, the past twelve months as well as very slow in communications, always a recorded telephone message that ask to leave a callback number or stay on Hold.  It was worst during this shelter-in-place period, when my wife called fives times, was disconnected four times before holding for 20 minutes whereupon she hung up in frustration.  She called a sixth time and used the company's callback option.  After a two hour wait, she inquired about her confirmed three month supply shipment that was scheduled to ship seven days earlier.  The company representative claimed that the company had lost its record of text orders (plural).  If true, then the company is irresponsible in not notifying my wife as these are important prescription products.  With great insurance and many choices, it's time to drop this dismal supplier, i.e. this company sucks.<//text>

At first, they did a good job. They shipped out my diabetic sensors and I had them on time. After several orders, they began saying there was problems with my prescription from my doctor which was never the case. My doctor has sent in everything that was required from the start.. I seen it myself.
Then, my orders weren't on time... they used to call or text me telling me it was time to reorder and would even provide the tracking number.
Now, it's no orders and no communication.  I've tried sending emails, phone calls,  text messages and no response.
They were supposed to send out an order last month and still nothing.
Very very bad and poor customer service.
Will be filing a complaint with their states attorney general.<//text>

Sorry to see the number of people that are unhappy with ADS.
They are my 2nd Medicare Diabetic Supplier. The first group was terrible !!
By far---- do a great job---polite, very professional, on time, accurate.
I am very happy with them-  Terry< /review>

<text>There needs to be an option for zero stars. This is an absolutely HORRIFIC company.  My son’s supplies were due to come in (late). It caused him to run out of sensors and his transmitter had expired. He was suffering from a weekend of scary lows so not having his supplies was extra dangerous. When I called they said their system was down they’d get back to me (they never did) in a couple days. We had no sensors or transmitters!!!!! Thankfully I called dexcom and they told me I could call my son’s endo and get an emergency refill through our pharmacy so I did. When I called ADS to see where our supplies were four days later they said they couldn’t fill the prescription because I got it filled somewhere else. WHAT???? I had to get it filled somewhere else because of THEIR negligence. Needless to say I yelled and eventually talked to a supervisor and his supplies are supposedly on the way. The gross negligence, apathy, and lack of urgency for providing life saving medical supplies is terrifying to say the least. I am asking my son’s endo to change our supplier our next appointment. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY! They can care less about their customers.< /text>< Pics>

If I could give this company zero stars, I would.. I don't even know where to start since Advanced Diabetes Supply has literally screwed up on so many fronts when it came to getting the proper pump supplies for my son. Now they refuse to field any phone calls or try to fix the issue. I would say they are on the borderline of being fraudulent at this point.</text>

<review>I am shopping for a supplier for my Medtronic pump& Dexcom G6 CGM. I have had such bad customer service from suppliers that I HATE dealing with any & all suppliers. The problem is that Medtronics & Dexcom want to just concentrate on bettering their products, and they force us to use medical suppliers. PLEASE understand that if you would have great customer service, you could DOMINATE this business! All people want is good customer service! Read the complaints. They are the same that I have from other companies. SOMEONE IN THIS BUSINESS NEEDS TO STEP UP AND BE THE CHICK-FIL-A OF MEDICAL SUPPLY COMPANIES. Will it be you? Do you have the character, integrity and honesty to be the leader?  (I give you a 3 star because I do not want to hurt or help you since I am not a customer.)<//review>< pics>

I wish I could leave a no star review. Please please double think before going with them to receive your medical supplies. I have amazing insurance yet every 3 months when it came time to order my supplies they gave the run around each and every time. Asking for nonsense updates from doctor or insurance. My records were never updated despite me doing several follow ups. Do not go with with this company. I repeat DO NOT GO WITH THIS COMPANY unless you like waiting weeks, even months on end to receive your supplies.</text>

My son is T1D and receives his Dexcom Sensors from ADS. Not one order has came on time. We have duel insurance and not one order has gone thru the second insurance. They are supposed to be changed every ten days but they will only fill after a calendar month plus 5-7 shipping days! that's a whole week of no Dexcom! its beyond unacceptable! Its sad we have pharmacy benefits but thru Durable Medical Plan its cheaper and goes twords our deductible but companies like this have no care to the patients actual medical needs. I would not recommend to anyone.< /text>

The absolute worst ever . They do not ship orders on time . You must call in order for them to ship out your supply . They move my shipping date because I didn’t receive some email to confirm which I never ever did! Pure BS !! Bad company please order some another place !<//Review>

Huge selection of supplies which saved my family money.  Excellent staff and very knowledgeable.  It's hard to find cheap supplies, and with the economy in shambles it's nice to have a resource.  I would definitely go back.  This is top-notch all the way.</Review>

<text>This is the worst diabetic supply company ever.   Please take your business elsewhere.   I am a medical office manager and our office will not deal with this company.   They are incompetent and will lie to patients to cover for themselves.   The amount of paperwork they filled out is excessive and unnecessary.  Your fax will be lost, you will wait forever for supplies/ if you ever get them at all.  Medicare patients:   You have better options for supplies.  A grievance will be filed- ADS does not deserve a Medicare contract!!!!!!<//text>< userid>

They sent me an invoice charging me a grandiose amount for supplies from last year, which were completely covered by my insurance at the time. I've been trying to get a hold of them repeatedly through email and by phone to sort his out, and no one is answering. This is horrible customer service -- I'm hoping a negative review will finally grab their attention.<//review>

very poor customer service.  I cannot get my supplies in a timely manner.  This has become a second job for me.  My phone calls and emails go unanswered.  I am completely fed up. I would give them negative stars if that was an option.  if you have the option of using another supplier- do so and stay away from this company.</Review>

Terrible experience getting prescription for Omnipods verified by ADS/Northcoast Medical Supply. My doctors office sent all necessary paperwork over about a week ago and I have yet to receive a shipment confirmation from them. I received conflicting information from sales reps last week, was even told I was dropped by my provider which was not true (but the most horrifying thing a patient can hear), was not contacted with follow-up information as promised and have called three times this week to get in contact with them and have yet to speak with anyone. I've been stressed and worried all week; I literally need these supplies to live. I am livid and disappointed and would not recommend anyone use this supplier. This is a MEDICAL SUPPLY company and any and all issues should be treated professionally and urgently.< /review>

ADS became my new provider of diabetes test strips in the summer of 2016 and it took months to get my strips.  Clearly the company was overwhelmed and did not have the staff to run this program effectively.  I spent hours calling and emailing to get the strips.  I ran out of supplies twice.  Finally when I decided it must be a fradulent company, I sent letters to the appropriate agencies.  Then a Sales person from ADS
called me and sent my strips but also many other products that I did not need or never use at a great cost to medicare my insurance and me.  And now I also have a pile of supplies that I will never use.  What a waste!!!<//review>

Ordered  test strips and lancets almost a month ago.
Still don't have them.  I called and the girl on the phone had lots of excuses.
She said Dr. didn't send prescription.  I know they did !
Order still not shipped.
All of this BS didn't happen when I went to Costco and walked out with my order.
Customer service is lousy !</Text>

<review>I have worked with them for a bit more than a year now getting Dexcom CGM supplies. My account manager has always been very helpful, and calls before I am due for a refill to set everything up. Supplies arrive on time, and they handle all of the insurance billing. If you are a CGM or  insulin pump user, check these folks out.< /review>< user_id>

I think this business is no longer operating.  I have been trying to reorder supplies since mid June.  I was PROMISED a shipment over a week ago.  I have called more than a dozen times, waiting on hold for over TWO hours without talking to a human, and have emailed them three times.  I am without my prescription right now.  My only conclusion is these guys are CLOSED and no longer in business.  If you are diabetic and relying on these guys you are way out of luck.<//text>

<Text>I usually only write positive reviews, but my experience with Advanced Diabetes Supply has been so frustrating that I just had to write a negative review.  First of all, getting someone on the phone is nearly impossible.  If you leave a message, it takes days for them to return your call.  I am a Type 1 diabetic that uses an insulin pump and must check my blood sugar 8 times a day.  Even with sending BG logs and office visit chart notes, I have never been able to be approved to get the number of test strips needed.  This last time, after talking with someone at ADS at least daily for 2 weeks and my doctor faxing the same information to them at least 4 times, I have transferred my prescription to WalMart.  If you use an insulin pump and are on Medicare Part B to cover your diabetes supplies, do not waste your time on Advanced Diabetes Supply!</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

<Name>Scott Curry< /Name><Text>This vendor supplies my CGM sensors and transmitters, but they are closed on nights and weekends and have no customer service even during business hours. The only means of contact is by phone and email, and they do not respond to either. They claim to have a means to text them re status of orders, Rx'es, and shipments, but this means of contact has never functioned. It boggles my mind that such a company can be doing business with my BC/BS insurer as a supplier of critical diabetes supplies, but I guess having no human beings on staff to make sure customers are actually getting their products saves a lot on overhead costs.< /Text><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

This is a HORRIBLE company to get supplies through. They have "forgot" to send my omni pod supplies on several occasions, and then offering to overnight the supplies for free, they still charged me for the over night delivery fee. I have called the company several times to discuss this and when I finally got a live person on the phone they told me it was processed and would take a few days. It has literally been 4 weeks, and no one at this company can seem to help me. They also "forgot" to send my supplies again this month, and did the same thing to me. They are very frustrating to work with, and cannot seem to figure out that people with diabetes need their supplies and cannot go days without it. WORST COMPANY EVER!!!!< /Review>

<review>Having trouble reordering Dexcom supplies.  They used to call way too often for refills but now never call me at all. Trying to call them is tough and I'm not sure if they have a website reorder system. When calling I always have to leave a message, today because recording said they they are all in a meeting and can't answer phones.  Other problem is the number of times I have to renew/reverify my prescription causing me additional doctor visits and delays while getting all the redundant paperwor, this time just because it's a new calendar year.</review>< Pictures>

I am an insulin dependent diabetic.  I am now out of test strips thanks to Advanced Diabetes supply.  I have attempted for 3 weeks to get my 3 month suppply.  firwt it was because I needed a prescription trenewal from my doctoer.  then it was because he had not refilled it, and could I call him.  Then when I verified that he had refilled it, it was because he did not fill out the paperwork properly.  When I derterminied that was corrected, it was to be delivered next tuesday, When they determined today was also tuesday, it was to be delivered today.  I even called twice today to verify delivery.  Wrong again!  Now I can not test my blood!  There is something terribly wrong with this company, or is this personal?  Guess I had better find another firm to provide me with diabetic supplies.</Text>

Five and a half weeks since my doctor sent in a prescription for test strips and lancets under Medicare.  As of today "the one person who handles medicare will get back to you, sometime."  Do not use this supplier.</review>

<Text>Horrible company! Every single time my supplies are supposed to be shipped they send only a portion of my prescription. I have had to reach out to my dr’s office multiple times for emergency supplies. I hate ADS.<//Text>< Pictures>

Great system for Rx refi;;s.  ADS send me an email notice that my Rx needs to be refilled  soon.  Refill request is processed very good, and the order is shipped out and delivered with minimal problems.  Great Service.<//text>

I have been coming to this spot for my coffee and meal needs for a while now! Lucky for me, it's a walking distance from work so I can always enjoys a stroll with my meal! Their food is delicious and they don't skimp out on the avocado! The staff is always friendly and welcoming. Everything comes out soft and crispy in all the right places.< /review>

<text>Stopped here after spotting it while driving by. Really glad that we did. We ordered the Philly Cheesesteaks and I got a mocha frappuccino. The sandwiches were huge! The bread was fresh and toasted just right so it was crunchy on the outside but still hot and soft on the inside. The ratio of meat to bun to cheese was perfect. The vegetables were also cooked to perfection and the cheese was fully melted. The frappuccino was delicious as well, not too much chocolate like a lot of places tend to do. I would have liked it more if it had whipped cream, but that's just me being picky. We were both very glad that we decided to stop in and will definitely be back! Honestly, after a few more trips, this might get bumped to a 5 star. Consider it a 4.5 from us.</text><user_name>Metallic Mook</user_name>< time>

Delicious fresh sandwich and a great strong iced coffee. Just what I needed today in a friendly atmosphere. There are very few choices around here and I'm happy I found Creative Deli.</text>

Always a great little uphill hike with a spectacular view! Dog friendly, people friendly and not too long at right around 4 miles round trip. Views in all directions but the views north over Shasta Lake dam to Mt Shasta and west looking down on the Sacramento River and out toward whiskey town are beautiful.  My Shasta was clothed in clouds this day.<//Text>

Good hike! 5.5 miles round trip. It has a pretty great view of Mt. Shasta and Shast Dam. The top doesn't have a lot of room to sit or be in general but there is a picnic table underneath a tree that sometimes provides shade. Overall pretty good!< /Text>

Not too bad of a hike. 2.4miles to the top, really a gentle hike, took about 45minutes up at an easy pace.<//text>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>An easy going hike, take around 1.5 - 2 hours up and down (with no stopping for lunch or anything).

Beautiful views, easily one of the best hikes in the area! I have been at various times in the year, always well maintained and worthwhile.

Highly recommend for families, or people who struggle to hike, but still want to get out and do things!< /Text>< pics>

Great trail for our family.  I have a 9 year old & a 5 year old and they had a blast.  The trail is easy to find and well marked.  At the top of Chemise Peak is a shaded picnic table, great spot to view Shata Lake & Dam.<//review>

Short hike/bike if you park at the Flanagan Road trailhead. Other you can make it a longer route from other places. Great down hill on a bike, just be careful of people coming up, very popular trail<//text>

Pretty clear today.  Nice breeze.  Sunny but not hot.  Trail has rocky sections and is powdery due to 30+ days of no rain.  Big CalFire crew hiking down.  Always a joy.<//text>

Nice hike, mostly a gradual uphill the whole way up to the peak.  Starts out in shade and gets exposed toward the top.  Great views of the 3 shastas.  Try to plan on clear mild day.   Nice park bench at top.  It can get crowded at times on peak.  Cell service the whole way.  Seen bikers, dogs and runners.  All ages.<//Text>

Brandon was very knowledgeable and shared how we could improve the efficiency of our older AC unit. He had a great attitude and was COVID safe at all times. I would definitely use this company for a my AC needs. Plus they have a very minimal monthly fee for continuous maintenance! Unfortunately it's rare to still find honest businesses such a Service Champions.< /text>

<review>Best Service Ever!
We just had the most amazing “White Glove” Five Star Experience! Just a few days ago we had a personal consultation and a complete Analysis of our heating, air conditioning, venting and insulation status at our home in Benicia. Our entire HVAC System was original and all except for our undersized compressor nothing else had been upgraded since 1979. So, we decided it was time to  modernize our whole house. ￼￼￼￼￼Scott and Ray put a system design together to completely renovate our entire home using ALL AMERICAN MADE products including a 5 ton AC, Lennox heating system, all new vents, a whole house fan and a complete clean out/sanitization and installation of R38 insulation in the attic. All of this was scheduled to take place over a 6 day timeline. Then... WOW! Yesterday was day 1. Washington and his 6 man crew showed up around 8:30 am and went to work. Talk about a Rock Star Team! By 7 pm EVERYTHING had been professionally installed and we were enjoying the most comfortable environment our home has ever had. I forgot to mention that 5 of our 13 vents had hardly ever been able to deliver enough air to make a noticeable difference in any of our downstairs rooms. Now they all enjoy an even temperature and we are looking forward to soon having friends and family for a stay in our guest room. Amazing work you guys! A 6 day job in just 1 day! We couldn’t be happier. The last step will be having the new attic insulation installed next week. So, I guess you could say a 6 day job in just 2 days! Thank you so much you guys. We are your biggest fans and walking billboards. You and your company are simply the best!
Blessings,
Michael & Jeannie Mau
PS: And that’s not all. We look forward to seeing your Service Champions truck at our home each month when your technician stops by to service our new system. You guys are awesome!</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9ybfsz7FdcsNj6PdryrNNv7VidEiSYwXt30Lr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPL2uwSBUaty5d_WpN2bTsRfVwzjAw0ytRxZPay=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Resp>

In general, I have been very happy with Service Champions. They contact us when scheduled maintenance is upcoming, they’re flexible on scheduling and they show up on time. We’ve been using S.C. for a few years and the technicians always seem to be very positive and technically capable. S.C. appears to place a high value on customer satisfaction. That’s very much appreciated.<//Text>

<review>Eli was extraordinary! Explained the entire process, as did the entire team I met with, Tyler and Stephen. My big job was done in one day...simply amazing. From the first phone call to completion of my job 4 days later I have been impressed as I sit writing this in my delightfully cool home. I give 5 stars and am so very glad I chose Service Champions!!! Thank you!< /review><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1619609005369, 'text': "Thank you so much for sharing your experience!

<rating>1< /rating><Text>9 months later and the system is no longer working.

It appears Service Champions sold us a system that is too large for the existing ducts in our home.

The only option we have been given is to spend more money to put in extra intake ducts and replace our existing feed ducts to solve a problem that was caused by their initial salesperson.

Their technicians are very nice and their phone support is friendly, be wary of their salesmen. It seems that making the sale and selling the more expensive item means more to them then selling the appropriately sized system for your home.

As of now we are left with a warranty for a system that we have been told will never work correctly as-is, a house that becomes sweltering with no way to cool it off, and a solution offered of "pay us more money".

Update:
I was contacted by a manger and two very nice and professional tech came to my home. They spent 8 hours fixing intakes and vents.  The I was not charged anything for this as it is covered under their warranty/guarantee

This time the AC worked for over an hour before during off and refusing to turn back on.
Fifth appointment is set for 24 hours from now so I get another day of no air conditioning.<//Text>< Pics>

< Review>
Service Champions has serviced our home air conditioning and heating systems since 2017.  I cannot be more pleased with the level of service the technicians have provided each and every time!   They represent the company well!

The technicians are professional, personable, friendly, punctual, and knowledgeable.  Both Steve and Tyler really took the time to explain every detail of my heating and air systems and performed  thorough inspections as well as provided honest recommendations.  They were patient and enthusiastically answered all my questions. I never felt as though I was being rushed or pressured to buy a product that I did not need.  Furthermore, Steven really worked with me to ensure that I received the best deal on my replacement systems.

I like it when employees of a company are genuinely happy to be a part of the team. I believe that it is important to love the work you do and to feel valued as an employee. Good job Service Champions!

I look forward to a lifelong business relationship with them.

Sincerely,

Rita</Review>

As always, Ben did a great job. He was prompt, courteous and explained all the details about the thermostat he was installing. He informed me when the new filters would arrive and when my next regular service would be. Service Champion employees are always aware of the customers wishes and maintain distance, wear masks and they wear foot coverings. I appreciate their professionalism!<//Text>

I have had the pleasure of having AC/Heating services being covered with Service Champions for 2.5 years. As a newbie to the home owner experience, this companies a must have on your list of who to call. They are responsive, courteous, and really do everything they can to treat you like one of their own.  Home ownership is a huge undertaking and can get expensive. But this team gets that and they do what’s right 100% of the time. Let’s just say you get what you pay for, and these guys are worth it.
Thanks Service Champions for putting this newbies woes at ease. Really appreciate all you do!<//text>

Justin Starr is outstanding. He is very professional, knowledgeable, clean, friendly, polite, honest, and has great skills. He also did a great job explaining and installing my air scrubber. All of the Service Champion workers have been outstanding. Justin is the best. I hope he continues to service my system. Service Champions is. an outstanding company. They even gave a profile of Mr. Starr before he came. I have never seen that before. They also have the best products and focus on keeping my system rumming optimally. Thanks so much.

Service Champions provides excellent service to their customers.  They have trustworthy safety protocols in place during COVID. My telephone calls are always answered by a real person. The customer service is top-notch! Rodney, our technician, was very  professional,  thorough, and personable. He explained each service and was very conscientious about his work and also keeping our home clean. Rodney left a detailed report and took lots of pictures so we could see the areas of service.  We trust Service Champions and feel that the service they provide is a good value.  I would highly recommend Service Champions Heating & Air Conditioning!< /Review>

Mike started my day with a smile along with his expertise and professional knowledge. He explained everything very well and advised that I could buy a heater filter that is reusable, which is a great saving for me.  Mike was so easy to talk with and has a sense of humor.  He checked my water heater and found that it needs to be replaced. Thank goodness he did because it could have/would have burst open anytime.  Please have Mike be my permanent service technician. Thank You Mike. I LOVE YOU GUYS!!!!< /Review>

<Text>Stephen came out and installed our system professionally, carefully and with patience, explained what he and his partner were doing every step of the way. He answered all of my questions and by the end of the day our system worked beautifully. The installation looked fantastic and the guys left our garage very neat and clean. I have been using Service Champions for years and have never had a bad experience with any of their service personnel. I joined their MVP program which entails them coming out twice a year to inspect, clean and replace filters as required. This gives us peace of mind, knowing that we’re being taken care of.

< Review>
Cody did a complete maintenance on my furnace.  He also checked my water heater.  He was very thorough.  He found a problem with the ignition in the furnace that he said could wait until next year, but I decided, based on the photo and the information he gave me, to go ahead and replace it now.  He thought he had the correct part in his truck, but it wasn't the right one.  He plans to check the warehouse and, if it's not in stock, order a new one.
12/15 Cody returned with the part (ignition) and replaced it.  He was fast and very congenial.  Now I don't need to worry about the furnace not working.< /Review>

Ed Billy performed an inspection of my broken heater and the duct work under my home.  Having completed the inspection, he spent some time preparing three possible estimates from which I could choose, depending on my needs.  He also spent some time providing me with the company’s history and their customer service philosophy.  I am impressed with his knowledge and enthusiasm about his work and the company for which he works.  Based on his presentation, I feel comfortable placing placing my trust in him and his company, and I have scheduled the date for installation of a new heater and duct work!  Great job Ed!

Every time a service guy from Service Champions has come out they have done an absolutely wonderful job we have never had a problem with any of them, very professional, very nice and they explain to you everything you need to know. Thank you thank you Service Champions you've always had really good tech's. It was nice to meet Mike today.<//review>

<Review>This is a good value/service completed annually. Usually before the cooling system in the spring.  Well worth the subscription we pay. In addition we also receive preferred service response if needed.< /Review><date>1615400045240</date><rating>5</rating><userid>110377041634793647078< /userid>< GmapID>

<text>Jonathan Nichols  checked our heating system and air conditioning system thouroughly bg conducting necessary tests. He cleaned the filter and checked the vents.  Went up the attic to assess the  ducts. He  made a detailed report to us of what he did and made recommendation .  We appreciate  very much being informed of his findings so we know what to expect and how to plan for future repairs or maintenance.
Excellent  service!!!!  Thank you !!!!</text><gmap_id>0x808fec098826f14b:0x488fa2d94bbaad01</gmap_id><pics>None</pics>< Rating>

<text>Nick came out to service our furnace. We had just moved into this property, so we wanted to have things in order. Nick was so respectful and mindful of our home. Even down to the little things such as removing his shoe booties when stepping outside and putting booties back on when back inside the home. He wore a mask, and an worked quickly. Although it was unfortunate that he couldn't complete the service due to the way our furnace was installed (couldn't cut the power due to power cord fusing to outlet for him to service the unit). That was in no way his fault and out of his hands. Once we get an electrician to fix the issue, we will definitely book again with this company to service the furnace. Aside from the furnace, he took the time to address some individual concerns we had about the condensate lines. He also measured our filters so that we would know what sizes to buy as we are still learning about this house. Thanks Nick!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1610735121176, 'text': "Thank you so much for sharing your experience!

Service Champions was great and had a wonderful service promotion so I had them come out and inspect my HVAC system. The technician came on time and was very professional and followed all the covid guidelines.  He went over all the inspections and let me know the sizes of the filters so we could change them out later. He was quick but thorough and I do recommend using Service Champions if you have any needs for repairs or maintenance on your AC or heating units. 5 out of 5 stars.</review>

Honestly I don't know if I have ever met a technician as thorough and ethical as Stephen. What should have been a 2 hour job on insulating some ducting turn into 6+ hours. Every join was sealed in multiple ways and covered with new insulation. Loads of pictures were taken and explained. He and Samuel even uncovered two separate areas of subfloor that had additional ducting previously undectected. They did such a great great job!! A pleasure to have in our home.< /Text>

Service Champions installed my HVAC system three years ago and have maintained it ever since. They are one of the most professional and reliable companies I have ever done business with.

Nick was professional, courteous and very informative of our HVAC. We just moved here from Virginia and purchased a home in Vallejo. We noticed the previous owners used Service Champions and decided to to give them a chance. It was the best choice we made! Signed up for the MVP program for our 11 year old system and wish I could have as clean check up (medically) as our system was. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Nick and Service Champions!</text>

I have the VIP service so Service champions comes out every six months or so to check on my A/C HVAC. I knew my A/C is starting to get old and was making noises so they gave me recommendations on how to fix the motor or replace the motor I have options now. I've always been impressed with Service Champions I have used no one else for the last 15 years. Great people to work with.< /Text>

Mr. David Nickmorad is a very professional and technically oriented sales person. During his visit he provided a very detailed presentation about the  Service Champions and HVAC products he proposed  to replace our existing heating and AC system, that was also originally installed by Mr. Kevin  Comerford's Temperature Perfect company that is now part of the Service Champion chain of companies.
Nick was able to provide detailed answers for all my questions related to the proposed HVAC system that I am seriously considering to purchase now or at a near future date.
Service Champions should be proud to have David as part of their sales team who leaves a very positive impression about the company and the products offered to the potential customers.
I wish David a very bright & successful career at Service Champions.< /text>

The technicians arrived on time and were well-organized, and they were prepared to install my new A/C, furnace, humidifier quickly and professionally.  They were friendly, they explained their procedures, and they installed the equipment without any problems.  I commend them for their work.<//review>

They built this company around a better customer experience—and actually did it!  They left no stone unturned.  From appointment scheduling to employment standards and training, to better deals from suppliers, scheduled maintenance that extends the useful life and efficiency of your HVAC.  They are head and shoulders above the rest.<//text>

Could have had heat/AC purchase and install for a little less with a "discount" company, but their high level of professionalism/knowledge was worth it.  Doing an install  of a unit can have its challenges and I would rather pay a little more to know that any challenges will be met and done right!</Text>

Technicians arrived on time and followed all Covid protocols throughout the whole installation. Ron and Santino were extremely professional, kept me informed of the process of the install and went above and beyond my expectations. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. A+++ to Service Champions.</Text>

Service Champions is a terrific company that REALLY cares about their customers.  Their technicians are friendly, very skilled in communicating your HVAC's situation and needs (and it's great to see a former Casa Ram out in the community!)  Phone operators are always courteous and kind, and super helpful.  I'll be using their service as long as I'm a homeowner.</review>

I asked them for old furnace checkup. It had an issue and we ended up a new furnace. They did it in a half day: 5, I met and spoke with 4-5 employees. They are all smiling, friendly, well trained and disciplined. Every one of them put their own shoes covers on to get in our house. A senior engineer was teaching a younger engineer. Must be a good work place. People: 5, The new furnace:5 so far after a few days. On time: 5. The reason of 4 not 5 is that they didn't respond to my text when the old furnace failed after checkup. We were frozen for two days. The higher cost is also a minus. I pre-researched online. Their offer was much higher than average installation cost of the same model on internet review. I don't like their subscription model. It doesn't make much sense to me because I don't have an AC. I also saw a few people gave one-star to them. I still decided to ask them because there were much more five-star reviews and the engineers explained the issue and the solution very well to me (I am an engineer, too). I am expecting that high cost will be explained by their good service.< /text>

Cody did a very thorough job inspecting and testing our heating and AC. He found one item that was significantly out of spec and was able to replace it in 20 minutes with a part from his truck.<//Text>

I really like the prompt, courteous, friendly and professional way Justin handled my issue. He took pictures of my system, showed me how to handle some basic matters with the heating. He had PPE and booties too (Hate contractors who track dirt into my home... pet peeve!) And the whole transaction was paperless--no annoying pieces of paper to sign and keep--everything, from pics, receipts were then immediately in my inbox for me to read through. Good company, don't hesitate to book!< /Text>

Justin went above and beyond and was very responsive to the fact that I'm in the midst of preparing the house to put on the market. He offered to help me mentioning that he could see I already had a lot on my plate and he stepped up and was extremely helpful to me. I can recommend service champions personnel and their quality workmanship as an MVP customer for several years.<//Text>

Samuel was on time, friendly and because I have a cat he showed me a picture of his family's cat. He did maintenance on my furnace for the winter season and checked the air flow. I purchased a device that will clean the air and a cover for the air conditioner, because of all the leaves and bushes that are around it. He was very complete and professional. He even brought two empty trash cans back in the garage for me. I am always very happy and satisfied with the work the work of Service Champions, especially knowing that my home will be nice and comfortable this winter.< /review>

From Debbie and Ariel setting up appointments and scheduling work, to Shaun who gave us peace of mind as he walked us through our options, instilling in us a confidence level this project would go off smoothly, to Mike an his crew who showed up the NEXT DAY, our experience with Service Champions was great. All the folks we dealt with at Service Champions made it clear our needs were what they were razor focused on. That customer first perspective permeates the organization. That does not happen by accident but rather by constancy of purpose made clear by leadership and leading by example.<//Text>

Devin came for an annual service for our furnace.  He thoroughly checked out the furnace, our attic insulation, ductwork, airflow, temperature throughout the house, and registers and installed a new filter.  In addition, he did a thorough examination of  the water heater and checked for gas leaks.   After he finished, he thoroughly explained all that he did and his findings.  I have confidence that our heating and hot water are in excellent shape.  He let us know exactly when he would arrive, followed covid protocols, and was very professional and friendly.<//text>

I’m a senior home owner and my heater went out , I called to make an appoint and for as soon as possible and the girl answering the phone kept asking me questions ,I told her before we go through all that I need to know the soonest appointment you can get me she kept asking questions then I told her again I need to know the soonest I don’t want to go through all these questions then you can’t get me a technician today she said well if you’re in hurry may he call another company.  So rude.  I have seniors that are living in a house and it’s a cold morning and she doesn’t care.  Tells me enough about this company already, no values no mercy.  No thank you. Never calling them again and I don’t recommend this company already< /Review>

Donald and his apprentice were both polite and engaging. When it came to actually looking over all the equipment Donald was thorough and he educated me with home size vs AC size given the amount of air it needs to move. Also the air intake opening needing to be larger for the AC size to acheive max airflow.

This is my new go to company due to the high level of knowledge and professionalism.< /Review><name>Lexie Marco</name>< Gmap_id>

We have a combination Air conditioner and furnace system for the second story of our home.  The old air conditioner gave up the ghost at the start of the last heat spell.  Service Champions came out promptly, gave us some options, recommendations and a quote.  They came out once the equipment came in and did a nice job on the installation.  Very efficient and courteous gentlemen provided the quote and the work.</review>

Always get great service from Service Champions! They came out quickly and solved the problem! So we thought. Problem cropped up, again, so they immediately came out the next day, and installed a new part. Looks like that will cure it, once and for all! Again, always get good, quick service from Service Champions!< /text>

Kyle was so informative and knowledgeable and explained what he was doing every step of the way.  He noticed I was having trouble with my computer and not only did he take care of my HVAC maintenance, he also took a little bit of time to help me get back on my wi-fi.  I really appreciated him going the extra mile to take care of something unrelated to his visit.  Great service!< /Text>

All of this while maintaining excellent social distancing. Great job!</review>

<review>Joel and Yanni were professional and informative with what repairs were needed.  This was a semi-annual check up since I am a MVP member.  When Yanni asked if there were anything else they can do for me, I mentioned my patio step which was loose, I really did not expect them to do anything with it, I even told them that, as that is not the nature of their job.  They went above and beyond and tried to
put the step back together.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1605342277164, 'text': "Thank you so much for sharing your experience! It's always a pleasure to take care of our clients needs."}< /resp>< gmap_id>

Be careful of this company! I called for an a/c repair. They did no diagnostic on the ac and went straight for the furnace. They tried to sell me a 10k furnace, when all I needed was freon. For it fixed for $700.<//Review>

<Review>I've been using their services for approximately 3 years now and I'm very pleased with them.  Their technicians have always been very skilled professionals.  They have caught several minor issues early and saved me a great deal of money by addressing them before they became major breakdowns.

Great communication.  They always remind me when it's time for my annual maintenance and their techs always call when they are on their way.

I highly recommend Service Champions.< /Review>< pics>

Nicholas J. visited my home today to service 2 ac units and diagnose an issue with the larger unit. He was very diligent, thorough and helped provide a great picture of the state of the problematic unit and took his time to explain our options. Overall it was a great visit and I am very impressed with not only the pricing but the quality of work and technical expertise Nick was able to deliver.< /text>

Eric came to evaluate our equipment and furnished a proposal to replace the existing HVAC system. He was patient to listen and answer our questions. I have dealt with them before to do the system maintenance. They were through and provided an excellent service.</Text>

I particularly appreciated his ability to explain issues in terms that were understandable.  I will be calling him back to service my heating unit in the fall. I highly recommend him to service any of your HVAC concerns.
A sincere thank you for the wonderful service you have provided us.

<user_name>Gregg Gerst< /user_name><Text>I asked Service Champions to do an inspection of my HVAC system in preparation for winter.  They told me both of my furnaces were damaged, leaking oil, had cracked parts and needed to be replaced.  Of course they offered to come out in a few days and provide pricing.

I obtained a second opinion from Grant Mechanical on the same day and was told both systems are fine and should last another 5-7 years.

Service Champions is sketchy and dishonest firm.  Stay away.</Text>< Pics>

Drainage line became clogged from condensation and floating cellulose insulation landing in drip tray. Technician cleaned out drainage so that central fan would activate and bring AC online. Put in call the day before and they would always be out the following morning. Professional and quick about getting job done.< /Text>

I had Austin and John install my furnace today. I thought both technicians were wonderful John was on light duty and was coaching Austin and teaching him perfection in his work, They worked all day and did a wonderful job installing my furnace. They left my home cleaner than they found it!!. Thank you both for a job well done.<//Text>

<Review>Steve was great! He came to check why our AC stopped working. He was tidy, respectful of our home and had very thorough recommendations.

Travis came next to review new HVAC options. He had excellent customer service! He was patient, very knowledgable and answered all our questions. We were so happy to work with him!!

A day later the next crew came in to install our new equipment! We are SO pleased with Mike and his team that came to install our new equipment. They were very professional, courteous, CLEAN, and efficient! Thank you Service Champions for taking care of us so well!!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Armando was so professional and polite.  He explained in detail everything he was doing and what the outcome was of his analysis of my heating and furnace situation. I'm very pleased with Service Champions customer service and will be using them to install a new furnace in my home. I appreciate the time Armando took explaining everything to me in detail, as well as that they were on time to perform their service. Very happy with my decision to try Service Champions.  I will be a regular customer from now on and want to thank them for their excellent customer service and professionalism!</text>

David at Service Champions was knowledgeable, professional, and personable. He serviced our hvac system for a reasonable price. He explained everything we were concerned about, and we will be pleased to have him return for the additional equipment we are having installed. Service Champions installed our air conditioner and replaced our furnace several years ago, and we have been pleased with them both and with the servicing over the years.<//Review>

All I can say is wow! I needed my AC checked after a home inspection for escrow. The office was professional and super accommodating. Steve Mee was my technician and arrived on time, wore all protective coverings and was super knowledgeable. I learned a lot about what to do in my next home.  Most important, my AC is clean and functional at its peak. I highly recommend this company. I will definitely use them in the future and ask for Steve. Thank you!!< /Text>

Third year of service and still love them. It really doesn't get any better than this. This company knows exactly what they're doing and how to do it right. The most professional dependable service I have ever dealt with oh, and I have dealt with many different services. Service Champions should go around and teach other businesses how to be successful. This company is amazing in every respect. Can't say enough good things about them. Awesome company. Professional, courteous, efficient. Highly recommend.< /review>

<Review>The technician came on time and was very knowledgeable. He shared all the details of inspections and maintenance work he performed on the HVAC.

I would give 5 stars to service champions.< /Review></record>

In November of 2019 service Champion rep, Ryan, came to our house and after reviewing the result of routine inspection of our old furnace recommended we should get a new furnaces. He recommended one which would completely change our experience! He went on and on  how this one have high quality and we will even feel the difference of air quality in no time. We agreed to change all of two furnaces and air conditioner with their winter bundle offer for over 40K. We really did not have problem with our old furnaces but they said it was old and had some cracks in it. Unfortunately since they installed them for us we have problem with hearting :( We had guests from overseas and end up with having technicians coming from service champion multiple times to figure out what is wrong. The one furnace continues working despite the temperature is high!! Our bedrooms during night feels like dry sauna!!!
We are very unhappy and  regretting that we ever did change our furnaces with them and worried about summer time to see how these new air conditioner giving us problems. To this date which is 3/26/2020 the problem has not resolved and with our busy schedules I am calling them to come again and again to fix the problem :((

<Review>I especially liked how Joseph took pictures with his cell phone of areas inside the furnace so I didn't have to bend myself out of shape to look at what he was pointing out, and how he carefully explained how each part functioned. He also had a low-key attitude, gave me the possible scenarios of what might happen if I waited to replace a certain part, so that I felt the decision was mine, not his. Extremely diplomatic, engaging, easy to talk to. No high-pressure sales tactics. Would love to have him back.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>Jim was very professional. His knowledge was outstanding and his suggestions were right on the dot. Because of his advise I will be saving hundreds of dollars in my AC and energy consumption.  Service Champions had been my go to company for at least 10 years ans today's visit only reinforced once again why I stick with them this long. The advise Jim provided is beyond my expectations, I am grateful and highly recommend anyone to use Service Champions for all their AC and furnace service needs. Jim thank you again for your outstanding service, advise and suggestions.  Blessings.< /Review></record>

<Review>Ryan did an excellent job of convincing us to do the whole job, rather than choosing to do it piecemeal, which would have resulted in double charges for the asbestos removal work.  He was well-informed, articulate, patient and persuasive.  He offered us significant discounts as well for asbestos abatement and his late arrival.  Even though he had had to skip lunch to make our appointment, he performed his duties very well.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1578241894192, 'text': 'Thank you for taking time to share your great experience.

<Text>Service Champions has treated us very well. We pay a small monthly fee (about $13) and they do a complete tune-up on our HVAC twice a year. Recently SERVICE CHAMPIONS replaced my HVAC system that was approximately 22 years old. They did an outstanding job. The last part of the process happened this morning when then installed a zone board since we live in a two-story home. The technician was Benjamin and he did an outstanding job. Everything is running well. I recommend Service Champions without reservation.<//Text><Response>{'time': 1589481729272, 'text': 'Thank you so much for taking time to rate our company.

My problem was no cold air when A/C was on. I called another service company first who misdiagnosed the problem. They then discovered I had a refrigerant leak in the system somewhere but unable to test for the leak.  I called SC and they responded with a sense of urgency.  I shared with David the service manager the brief history of events and he dispatched Ben (service tech) the following business day. Ben did a thorough re-review of the A/C system and initiated the test for leak process.  We still need to wait a couple weeks to see where the leak is and I will be submitting another review after that plays out. Anyway, both David and Ben were very patient with my questions and took the time to answer them to my satisfaction. Their professionalism is unparalleled and sets the standard for the competition to follow.<//Review>

Just had a whole new system put in (furnace and AC) and it went smoothly. The technicians were on time and they immediately went to work. The appointment was at 8am and they were done at around 3pm. Installation, loading the truck with the old equipment and clean up was done in good time. With the furnace came a new thermostat which I would have liked to gone over more with them but they were ready to go which is fine and I know that I have the manual but it's nice to ask questions and get a clear understanding. The reviews on the thermostat were not good at all so I hope it doesn't give me trouble! This is my first time dealing with Service Champions and so far so good. I hope it continues to be a good relationship since I just spent my retirement on a new system...lol! Shout out to the technicians for a job well done!<//text>

<Text>I got everything I needed! Furnace, AC, Insulation, Ducts, even Asbestos removal. All went perfectly well and everything was top notch. Not the cheapest option, but you don't want to mess around with cracker jack installations. I would give Service Champs 5 stars -- but neither my installer nor my rep seemed to know much about the Smart Home Lennox app. I was left to figure that out on my own, which isn't that difficult ,but still - they should really be the experts, because who doesn't want Smart Home today?<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Just finished a tune up for my AC unit with Luis Rivas. Luis was very friendly, knowledgeable, and thorough. He taught me a lot about our system and, as it turns out, our system is in great shape! He gave me a couple of ideas on where we could be more energy efficient, things to keep an eye on, and also options to prolong the lifetime of our system. Luis was absolutely a pleasure to work with, really top notch. I couldn't be more pleased with the quality of his work and professionalism. He was even great with my dogs, one of whom fell asleep at his feet while we were going through the details at the end of the service. Thanks again and see you next time, Luis!<//text>

Joseph arrived on time and made a great "first time" introduction. Then he explained what he was going to do re my ac "tune up" and then he did it while explaining what he was doing. He paid attention to details like wearing "booties" inside our house. Everything to like....hence my five star rating.<//Review>

After causing an issue with our heating/cooling unit, Service Champions went above and beyond to fix the problem. The tech came out on the weekend (we pay a subscription so they will come on weekends), couldn't fix the problem without a part that he didn't have.
He didn't have space heaters with him so he went and bought two of them and brought them to us - which would have been very uncomfortable without them.
They take care of their customers.</Text>

Hey Service Champion, you’ve done it again! Another awesome tech. John was fantastic. So intelligent and knowledgeable about my systems and very patient in explaining his process and what he discovered. He is A-1 for sure! Willing to go above and beyond too. Most importantly my dog Cesar really liked him!! All kidding aside, kudos go to you all for your outstanding training in customer service.</text>

The work was done efficiently and care was taken to insure all items were working properly.

Joseph and Dakota came to our house to check our units. Both were great! We have the VP membership, because our furnace and compressor are reaching the end of their life expectancy as well as we realize the importance of keeping our system clean. We learned a lot about our furnace and AC. Joseph was very detailed and showed us all the parts he was cleaning. Dakota looked in our attic to check our duct work. We are happy for them to come again and ensure we extend the life expectancy of our units.<//text>

Mitch and I worked on my old heater/AC.  We did not find the trouble with the motor, but we now have some ideas as to how to fix the furnace on/off problem.  I will keep Service Champions up to date on how I trouble shoot the problems with the heater unit in the future.  Mitch was easy to work with and seems to be a great asset for Service Champions.< /Text>

<Text>Joseph did a great job. When there was a small glitch in my plan, he went to bat for me and called the main office to work out a conclusion that was totally satisfactory to me. He also spent more time than a typical tune up appointment calls for. I’m totally satisfied.< /Text><Date>1562014746839<//Date></record>

Ben was very professional and got everything done that he needed to do in a very short period of time. I really appreciated his soft quiet voice and calm demeanor. It signaled to me that he was a true professional and he was going to make sure that all my appliances would be adequately taken care of. Great great company.<//Text>

<Text>Hector is the best in business! What was meant to be a simple project to install a new Nest Thermostat, turned out to be far more complex due to compatibility issues.  I needed to replace the thermostats, sensors, zone board, redo some of the wiring.  Hector is very knowledgeable.  he ahd Branden to help him out.  Both are very friendly.  Punctual- showed up on time.  Once they give you the quote, they will do the job for you even if they find more surprises.  HVAC is complicated stuff, better to get it done with pros like Service champions.<//Text>< Pictures>

I purchased the maintenance plan for my two single family home/ condos that are right next to eachother.  Service Champions come out to do my maintenance every year. They have always been good.  Larry was excellent.  He is very customer oriented, and thorough.  Both heaters are under the house, the crawl space in one is not very large.  Larry is a large man, but was able to do the job and take photos to show me what was going on, and explain it. He recommended a different type of filter for one furnace for the future.
He was not only helpful, but he was extremely pleasant.  Thank you Service Champions.< /Text>

Needed to check out our HVAC system (we bought our house 4+ years ago). Our technician was Nick Johnson, who was polite and pleasant. After about an hour and a half, he explained that our system was in pretty good condition, but needed to be cleaned in a few places. He cleaned them up, and left the work area clean. Good service!<//Text>

He was personable, knowledgeable and competent, as are all of the techs at Service Champions. He repaired the leak immediately and also looked at the thermostat. He was going to “adjust” the adaptive recovery feature. but, since another tech was already working on its replacement, we both agreed not to touch it.

Did more than expected, did the extras with great attitude and informative. We have 10ft ceilings and he happily got up there to change the air filter for us. He wasn,t pushy in his presentation of other products, we reallly appreciate that. Didn"t leave a mess behind Thank you.<//Review>

Communicative, prompt, friendly staff. Modern methods I appreciate (appointment reminders by email and text, copy of invoice by email). Fixed a sticky problem quickly — it took three visits because it was complex but they sent competent people (and at no additional charge).< /text>

Mason came out and was here on time. He did a full inspection, found a water pooling issue in the compressor compartment and was able to drill a couple of small drain holes to ensure that it would not continue to happen. All in all he was great. I appreciate the service.<//text>

John Gayden for Service Champions came to provide the annual service for my central heating furnace.  He arrived on time and did a great job.  He took the time to explain everything he did.  While he had the furnace opened up, he stopped to show the insides, explain what was good about the furnace and point out potential problem areas.  I was completely satisfied by John Gayden's service.</Text>

Workers arrived on time- Thank you Brock, Jose, Eon and Tony. Communication during the process was open and friendly.  Scope of work was delivered as promised. Quality of work was excellent.  I would highly recommend this company and their employees including Peter our Service Technician, Cooper our Comfort Advisor, and Melissa at the home office.  All our questions and concerns were answered and dealt with in a very favorable manner.< /review>

<text>Again Sam exceeded my expectations. So helpful and informative. He's almost becoming part of our family along with Service Champions. He had a person shadowing him today, Steve Hampton. Sam is training him well. If he follows Sam's lead I'm sure he will be a good asset for Service Champions.</text></record>

<username>Linda Dunn< /username><date>1594069345427< /date><Text>Service Champions has been my service company for my HVAC system for eight years.  They have taken excellent care of my system.  Their technicians are well trained and professional in every way. Daniel Kollehner has been my technician for a couple years.  He deserves high praise.  He is always cheerful, explains the service he's done and what might need doing in the future.  I have a miserable attic to work in and he always tackles it in good humor.  I can't imagine looking anywhere else for the servicing of my air conditioner and heating system.

Recently I have had issues with my water heater.  It kept turning off.  Barry was able to diagnose the problem quickly and remedy it very simply.  My thermocouple was corroded.  He sanded it and its been working like a champ ever since.  I so appreciate the expertise the technicians have to keep my HVAC and water heater performing.<//Text>< Resp>

Amazing service (and a working second floor AC unit) within a day!  Hard to believe that kind of service still exists but Service Champions (and the technician who identified the malfunctioning battery and had it replaced from stock parts in his service fan during his one hour home visit) proved it again.  Happy (and cooler) Pleasanton customers 👏.<//Text>

<Text>The city of Orinda was doing road work right outside my home the same day that I had scheduled my service, and the workers were redirecting and in some places prohibiting traffic. My service technician, Jacob Arriola, tried several different ways to get to my home, rather than give up and just move on to the next call on his list. Eventually, he was able to make it to my house and do his inspection of my furnace and air conditioner. When he was finished, he clearly walked through everything he had checked on the system, showed me back-up pictures, and explained to me how to replace my filter. He was incredibly helpful and a pleasure to work with.<//Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Very professional service and they honor the coupons in the mail. The scheduling was done without any trouble at a time convenient for us.

Jim was the technician who worked on the AC tune-up and Furnace Safety Inspection. He took his time, fixed some unexpected issues and also did a thorough review of the furnace safety and airduct inspection for leaks and insulation. He helped me find out some new information about my appliances that I didn't know before.

Definitely will be calling them again in future.<//Review>

Giovanni arrived on time, presented himself quite professionally, stated what he would be doing and proceeded efficiently and thoroughly. Checked the settings and components of the main heating, A/C unit in its closet and cleaned and checked the outside compressor unit. He was finished in about a half hour. Very pleasant fellow.<//review>

<GmapID>0x808fec098826f14b:0x488fa2d94bbaad01</GmapID><text>After hearing about neighbors’ AC units break, I wanted to be proactive and get our AC serviced. I saw Service Champions was highly recommended in Nextdoor by my neighbors so I decided to give them a try. They were so easy to schedule with - you can call, email, complete the website form or use the site chat. My appointment was in a few days with a 3 hour arrival window. Our service tech was Brian Kirby who came in the first 30 min of the window. Brian rocked!! He was knowledgeable, friendly and concise. He showed and explained to us the reasons what was causing our AC to barely work and he showed us pricing upfront to repair the issues. When we said we wanted to fix the issues, he immediately called in to check if he was able to stay and make the repairs which they confirmed he could. We ended up buying their MVP maintenance plan for a year and paid to have our 2 issues fixed. The MVP discounts on the issue repairs paid for the MVP plan! Well worth it and now we are MVP’ers for the next year which has a slew of great AC, heat and water heater service benefits. We are now big Service Champions fans - highly recommend them and Brian!!<//text><pics>None<//pics>< UserId.>

From the initial call, the service from this company is best in class. My appointment was on schedule, I was sent reminders and even a heads up that service was on it's way.  In first meeting Darrien Colaw, he was pleasant and extremely respectful.  He inspected our heater and noted where it could be more efficient.  We did not feel pressured or uneasy about talking about what was best for our situation.  Plain and simple, it was honest.  You never know what you are going to get when you call for service on something that you only know how to turn on and off, we hit the jackpot here!! Highly recommend and look forward to a long relationship.<//text>

They have taken excellent care of my system.  Their technicians are well trained and professional in every way. Daniel Kollehner has been my technician for a couple years.  He deserves high praise.  He is always cheerful, explains the service he's done and what might need doing in the future.  I have a miserable attic to work in and he always tackles it in good humor.  I can't imagine looking anywhere else for the servicing of my air conditioner and heating system.

Recently I have had issues with my water heater.  It kept turning off.  Barry was able to diagnose the problem quickly and remedy it very simply.  My thermocouple was corroded.  He sanded it and its been working like a champ ever since.  I so appreciate the expertise the technicians have to keep my HVAC and water heater performing.<//Text></record>

<review>I had an appointment for a Nest installation and I was quoted $89 for the service. On the day of installation the technician informed me that the company misquoted the service. I did cancel, however in the in the afternoon they called back and offered to install the Nest for the price that I was initially quoted. I look forward to having the service installed and,  I appreciate them honoring the quoted price. Thank you!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I received outstanding service from Service Champions dispatcher as well as from the technician, Par. He was highly professional and competent. He stayed with the problem until it was resolved even though it took making two trips to get the needed parts. I cannot say enough to indicate my total satisfaction with the entire experience.</text>

The smartest thing I have ever done is to purchase a maintenance service with Service Champions! They take care of everything!  They notify me when it's time for a 'check-up', make it so easy to schedule an appointment, and...they arrive on time on the scheduled day!! Isaias was amazing!  Professional, skilled, helpful, and he did everything with a wonderful smile!!! I can't recommend them highly enough!!!  Thank you Service Champions for giving me peace of mind when it comes to my HVAC system.< /text>

Service Champions always performs at the highest standard in all areas of service. Their customer service is outstanding!  John was my technician today and his quality of service was awesome and very professional. He took the time to show and explain the different components of my HVAC in layman terms and made helpful suggestions in maintaining my HVAC in the future.  Thank you Service Champions and Happy Holidays! 🎄

I would rate them at zero stars if I could. The tech who came out was nice and knowledgeable. The immediate problem was the start capacitor which takes about 10 minutes to change out and costs $20. I know this because I ended up doing the work. His quote was $600 !!!!!! (In addition to his $89 service fee) This is outrageous. This industry needs regulation and over sight as it is out of control. I thought I was dealing with the mafia.
This is an addition after a response from the owner; Please note that the $89 was your diagnosis fee, this is from the tech directly. Your response does not address the high prices you charge just standard company BS.<//Text>

I have always had excellent service from Service Champions and I had a new technician this time, David, and he did not disappoint!  He was one of the most pleasant and courteous people on the planet - had that respectful Southern charm!!  He even disposed of some rodents that I was unaware of that were caught in traps in my attic - yikes!!  I'm sure that is not in his job description!!  Thank you sooo much for going above and beyond the call of duty!!</review>

<Text>Service Champion's technician was good in terms of answering several questions. However I did buy their 1 year maintenance plan which seems reasonable (did not really explore more options). I am still betting on their claim that this tuning will reduce my electricity bill in next few months, if not, I shall contact them for their promise to refund me $88 :-)< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x808fec098826f14b:0x488fa2d94bbaad01</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Aubrey Briggs was a  very polite and courteous person.  When he introduced himself, he said  he was a new employee.  A few no minutes later another call from Service Champion rang.  It was from Brian Kirby , supervisor like person available for any questions or issues.  I was impressed with the quality of work  of these 2 men.

Service Champions are #1 They a truly make their customer's feel valued and appreciated. They always polite and happy to answer all your questions. I learned so much today from Sean about my heater and he actually showed and explained what needed to be done. Plus my cat liked him as soon as he walked into the house,she usually hides until the stranger is left the house.<//text>

Brandon and Service Champions were awesome. I had them come out for the $88 special and was very impressed with Brandon's professionalism, thoroughness, and attitude. He took the time to ensure I understood what he was talking about- no trying to upset me on anything here. You can trust these guys and I'm very happy- and I'm a tough one to please.

The company is responsible, hiring and training veterans who naturally are exceptionally competent. Your can't go wrong here.

Highly recommended! I'll have Brandon back for sure!<//Text>

I've had Service Champions visit my home maybe 4 times, and each time there was a different Technician,  They all were very professional very courteous, and they fixed the problem in a timely fashion. What I like most about them, is i have a gut feeling, that they are all straight shooters.< /Review>

<text>Last year, because of a health issue, my husband, was unable to do the routine maintenance system preparation for winter. After some research, I called Service Champions. They were friendly, kept me apprised of what was happening and made recommendations to help extend my system’s life. I was not pressured to buy anything extra and our technician, was knowledgeable, friendly and prompt. It was evident by his attention to the details that he genuinely loved his job! My old units looked and ran like new after he worked his magic!
My husband is much better and we both agree that because of the great service, we’re continuing to leave the maintenance of our AC and heating to the experts at Service Champions! Save yourself a headache and trust Service Champions.< /text><user>101079512096136578775</user><time>1610490291147</time>< rate>

We needed our furnace cleaned out and serviced. Call SC and they were able to make an appointment that worked with our schedule. The tech was friendly and arrived on time.

Your serviceman was very polite and sincere and even told me he checked everything twice to assure me the fix would cost me $2000+ and recommend replacing this furnace for $5900. I had a 2nd repair man who fixed my furnace the next day for just a $90 part replacement! You should be a shame of yourself Service Champion?< /Review>

<Name>Susan Brackenhoff<//Name><Text>What a great experience!  Travis was especially helpful and gave full explanations to his findings about our need for furnace repair.  He has been here to the house twice and both times it was easy, no hassle help.  One of the best technicians that I recall working with!  Excellent!
Steve gave us quotes on our water heater and was very knowledgeable. He made recommendations and let us have options to consider.< /Text>< GmapID>

<Review>Mike did a great job for us again! Installed our hot water heater and spent the extra time it took to do it right. This is the second job he has done for us with Service Champions and I couldn't be happier. The first time he was here his "office" for the day was in our attic adding new duct work. Terrific job. Thanks Mike!<//Review>< Pics>

Service Champion Appointments are  easy to schedule and kept on time.  Giovanni is knowledgeable and manages expectations well.  He let me know at the start what he will do, and reviewed that plus any deviations at the end.  He provided the annual heating system maintenance service as well as installed the air scrubber and washable filter.  I feel comfortable that I know how the new components should work and he or the company will resolve any questions or concerns that may come up.  I have an older HVAC system and it continues to work well I think because of regular Service Champion professional maintenance.<//Text>

<text>I called them out to repair a furnace blower that would not start. I have had this sort of thing fixed before and it was a run capacitor on the blower. The technician was very friendly. He said the fix required a new blower motor. He recommended we also replace the blower wheel, blower housing and transformer. Total cost $2238. I said to the repair guy....are you sure? He said yes. The blower motor was shot. I said no thanks, bought a replacement run capacitor for $6 and replaced it myself in ten minutes. Literally. It works perfectly now. We are out the $89 service fee with no value added whatsoever. Nice folks but they really lay the hard-sell on thick. I cannot recommend them.< /text>< pictures>

This company has the best service. Even how they confirm appointments is done with excellence and with the ease and convenience of me as a customer in mind. Their technicians are very honest and clear about what they think we should replace and what they say to hold off on (in my case it was a part that he felt still had a couple years left in it). Just very knowledgeable and trustworthy.</text>

<review>Showed up on time, wore shoe covers, and very good at explaining any issues. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is he put a hole in my wall. I'm not sure if the tech realized it and I didn't catch it right away because it's in a closet (attic access). I'm hoping the company will work with me to fix it.</review></record>

Service Champions is the right name for this awesome company with outstanding techs. Though I was apprehensive at first thinking to myself how much is this gonna cost me. After having Barry my service technician go through my entire system. The finding were not good my LENNEX after 18 years of service was not salvageable. This is a very reliable trustworthy company that help me with a replacement unit at a great price. As a homeowner I would highly recommend Services Championship to family and friends.<//Review>

It was a pleasure to have him diagnose and provide advice for my almost 20 year old heating & air conditioning system. I would highly recommend Service Champions, based on my experience with Chris Aylard! I feel confident that I don't have to worry about any issues with my furnace or air conditioning going forward because I have a service contract that will enable me to get help with anything within 24 hours!

He not only treated me with respect he was also personable. He  informed me of all he was doing and why and he even helped me get down my Christmas wreath.

Awesome service.  The tech. was considerate and clean.  Made good recommendations, which we took.   Signed up to have them check another system and to follow up next year.   Easy scheduling, took payment and signed for order on ipad in home.  Took pictures of work and problem areas to easily address.  Overall highly recommend.</Review>

Service Champions is definitely the best heating and air company of the region. They are professional, timely, courteous, and customer-service oriented. Their techs do an excellent job of explaining what happens during the service appointment, and what the options are for any follow-up. Ask for Michael Guido as the service tech, if you are lucky enough to nab him. We have been customers for many years, and would recommend the company highly.< /review>

<text>This company has the most professional, helpful, competent, friendly, punctual, flexible, reassuring technicians I've ever had the pleasure to work with. I am now a member of their maintenance service, and highly recommend them.

From the initial diagnostic visit to the discovery of asbestos-wrapped ducts in the attic, to their setting up the removal of those ducts in a timely fashion by an Environmental company, to immediately replacing the ducts with brand new ducts and registers as well as installation of new furnace and AC (the latter all in one day), the experience was the least stressful I've had, and I feel confident in calling on them in the future for anything related to the work.  Worth every penny for this kind of excellent service and peace of mind.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1546816912191, 'text': 'Thanks for leaving us a review.

<Review>This is a new company to me and they seem to know what they're doing. The technician Eddie broke down everything to me so that I understood exactly what was going on and what future problems I may have. I appreciated the extra time that he took to explain things to me and I look forward to seeing him again in November.</Review><Date>1529177822058< /Date>< UserId.>

<review>I've done business with the Comerford family for over thirty years, although the name has changed, their attention to precision craftsmanship,  detail, and customer service are still the highest quality!
The name of the company is now Service Champions. Call them when you need help with your furnace, air conditioner, or water heater, and I'm sure you'll be writing a review similar to this one.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<username>Yasmin Mercer</username><text>Service Champions sent a tech out to my rental property,  Donald which was amazing and I explained  that I was getting ready to install a new furnace at my personal property and told him I was quoted 19000! He explained that didn't sound right and he would like to get one of Service champions comfort advisors out for a complementary appt to see what they could do for me. They sent out Kandis whom I adore and was so helpful and gave me exactly what I wanted which was relocating the furnace as well as giving me a much better cost! I am thrilled to use this company and so thankful i had the opportunity to speak with Kandis before I made a terrible decision! My furnace is being installed in a couple days, just in time for my full house of family for Thanksgiving!!! Thank you Kandis, Donald!!! So happy!</text><gmapID>0x808fec098826f14b:0x488fa2d94bbaad01< /gmapID>< userid>

Robert was on time and treated our home with respect through his professionalism. He explained what he was doing and asked if I had any questions. His inspection of our heating and A/C system was thorough and didn't make a mess in our home. I wasn't expecting such an intense inspection of the system. It took about 1 1/2 hrs to check the equipment and the airflow in the whole house (very informative).<//Review>

<text>Mark arrived at the appointed time (which I always appreciate) and gave a brief description of the work he would be doing, and then got busy right away to accomplish his tasks.  He was neat and professional and periodically made contact with me to keep me informed of his findings (which were all good).  He asked some questions that lead to  think that I should have the ducts checked as well as the insulation, all of which are 40 years old.  He suggested a free no-obligation inspection which I decided to schedule in a couple weeks.   Mark was very pleasant and personable, and I feel that he did a very thorough and professional job.</text><gmapID>0x808fec098826f14b:0x488fa2d94bbaad01<//gmapID>< user>

I’ve have been using Service Champions for more than a year.  So far their staff is excellent, but one of your tech’s Ryan is above that.   He came to my house, he was polite and knowledgeable.  He didn’t mine going up to the attic to make sure that my air conditioning was working properly, when other techs wouldn’t.  My AC unit is running great and I recommend this company to all my friends.
Thanks again Ryan for your service.< /Text>

Nam is the consummate professional!
I feel I could trust everything he said, in answer to my questions.
He was polite, courteous, respectful, well-informed and a delight to have on the job in my home.
I could not have asked for a more positive experience with a company representative, while having my furnace ducts replaced.
I HIGHLY recommend Nam!< /Text>

Juan S. came across very professional, he was organized in his presentation and follow-up.  Personable and well mannered, he handled the process as a sales professional with the appropriate opener to ensure a cordial relationship was established.  The detail to which he applied in his explanations indicated both the attention he paid to the service work and his knowledge of the process.  All things said our experiences with Service Champions indicate they have chosen the right name and employees who match that philosophy.  Truly very happy with the service and product... definitely a company I can recommend and will continue to do business with.<//text>

I’ve have been using Service Champions for more than a year.  So far their staff is excellent, but one of your tech’s Ryan is above that.   He came to my house, he was polite and knowledgeable.  He didn’t mine going up to the attic to make sure that my air conditioning was working properly, when other techs wouldn’t.  My AC unit is running great and I recommend this company to all my friends.
Thanks again Ryan for your service.<//Text>

It was easy to schedule the appt and the price was right.Mark was the technician coming over today. He is nice person to talk with. He know his stuff and takes his time to explain and do things right. It was a pleasure to have him today. Next year I'll ask the company for his name to come over for my next furnace tuneup.  Thank you MARK WEBER!!</text>

Chris was knowledgeable, personable, and I believe thorough. He answered all my questions well and provided good suggestions for the best next steps for my 28-yr old furnace which still works fine, but has some predictable liabilities. Only reason for 4 rather than 5 stars was that his IR camera wasn't working, so he had to rely on standard optics for his diagnostic work. I'd be happy to have him return next time I need furnace inspection, maintenance, or repairs.</text>

<review>Chronology of events (latest to earliest)
Encounter 3: Jan 2021: 2nd Furnace purchased (1st purchase as noted below, 2 AC Compressors + 1 Furnace)

4.5 **** for their service techs (mostly excellent, knowledgeable, helpful, and goes the extra mile, with very few exceptions) Khaled continues to excel whenever he comes to service the equipment
3.5 *** for their installation techs. This time, they failed to ground the furnace and disconnect box - basic items that "should" to be done right the first time?! As a result, the "impossible to get hold of SJ City Inspection" failed, and more hassles to get the equipment certified.
3.0*** for the Customer Service - very friendly people, but not knowledgeable and has absolutely no power over their tyrannical Tech Dept. They will give many platitudes to placate the customer, but advise is to immediately request to talk to Tech Dept, otherwise one would have to repeat multiple times the same inputs since the Tech Dept almost never calls back after CS promises they will.
1.5** for Tech Dept. Does not call back until multiple escalation is made. Comes across as arrogant, not particularly helpful. They will fix the problem they created but only after one manages to get to them. (Monica seems to be the only responsive one in that department, Tye has not called back or responded at all both the times I had issues)
0.5* Sales. They will promise you the world, but disappears after the sale. In both my purchases, my Salesman promised a smooth process (ie installation and paperwork specifics - I was clear with my concerns then, and for this latest purchase, especially with the city certification, knowing the grief SJ City will cause). In the first case, they put it down to a "miscommunication" but they finally helped (after escalation) with the City Inspection.  Despite committing to "take care of inspection process and make it transparent to me", during the sales process, now I have a problem with City inspection, and they are nowhere to be found. I have called them but no call back, no sign of anything.

Now, I might expect Alicia or their CS manager to respond to this - seems like the response happens only the customer is extremely annoyed.

So should you go with them? IMHO for general maintenance, if you are not too particular about pricing, a convenient approach.
For new systems, imho "caveat emptor". Some days, you can be made to feel you are the center of their service. Other days just feel like it is too much work to be worth it. (like now)

But as a reminder to myself - I won't be silly to look here for my third upgrade! I really have to stop being so trusting!

Encounter 2: Oct 2019 >>Installation of 2 New ACs/1 Furnace + remedial work on missed installation items-failed City Inspection + subsequent maintenance work
** Update after multiple interactions... Not quite 5 Stars.. service and competency level varied across techs. Some problems encountered: installation of ac compressors not to city code. Minor rework needed. Missed a scheduled appointment totally. New ac compressor not cooling after 6 months. (imagine an approx $10k equipment not working after 6months!) LeamkimgLeaking coolant that couldn't be traced. No dye available to inject to trace leakage, have to return to redo. Problems to be expected but it just means tying up my time waiting for appointments, which I have to follow up on (did not call back to reschedule as promised) To be fair reasonably responsive, although their CS not very capable beyond the superficial greetings and perhaps scheduling work (even then).

Encounter 1: Fall 2019 :Service maintenance on old AC/Heaters
Khaled was the tech that helped me out today. Very timely, detailed in checking out all the issues and helpful with suggestions. Made very good observations and was very polite and kind.

This company seems to have done a good job training their staff and they seem to know what they are doing. Good job!</review>< Pictures>

<Gmap_id>0x808fec098826f14b:0x488fa2d94bbaad01< /Gmap_id><text>We were privileged to have had a home and duct performance test done by Spencer Strand. My wife and I found him to be knowledgeable, efficient, courteous, pleasant and a joy to work with. He performed the audit in a most judicious manner and reviewed the results with us. The cost of the audit is covered by our original plan and I wondered when the "sales pitch" for "critical services" was coming. It never did. He explained the inefficiencies of our system which prompted us to ask him about an estimate to resolve our system's deficiencies. He made note of the fact we would like to talk with someone about that issue after the first of the year.

We are impressed with the overall "business plan" provided by Service Champions. The owner got it right from get go until... All representatives seem to come from the same mold  as described above. It's as though we're members of a family and wouldn't dare go to another service provider. They have won us over. Spencer's a most able ambassador for the company. I see a bright future for him.<//text>< Rating>

<Review>Called Service Champions to come out for a maintenance check. No problems with my system, but it was 2 years since I moved into the home and wanted to check things since my PG&E bill went up.

Dominic was very detailed and answered all my questions brilliantly. He genuinely was interested in my questions and the system in the house. He performed an outstanding job so I bought their yearly service offering.

He made me comfortable there were no hidden costs and at the end when I signed he had a couple of recommendations, but no pressure. I decided to pursue one of the recommendations to fix my ducting, which, as evidenced in his photographs, is in poor shape.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Annual "Tune up" of my HVAC system. David U. was the technician. I brought to his attention an issue with the A/C and after a check of the system he decided that it was not a major issue or concern. I agreed with his assessment
I also discussed a concern re: the duct work below our house.  He decided to call his manger to discuss and we both decided that a more through inspection should take place., which will be scheduled.
David as all of his colleagues that I have interacted with over the past 12 years, was polite and willing to listen.
All in all a great experience, once again!<//text>

<Text>One of the best experiences that I have had in getting something completed for my home.  He arrived within the time frame given, he was courteous, clean, friendly, and knowledable.  He explained what he did and took pictures of what needed to be done.  He was not pushy in selling me more but presented great opportunities for me to save money.  Not something that I say frequently; this was the best experience I have had taking care of my old charming house.  Would highly recommend Service Champions and this man in particular.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>Chronology of events (latest to earliest)
Encounter 3: Jan 2021: 2nd Furnace purchased (1st purchase as noted below, 2 AC Compressors + 1 Furnace)

4.5 **** for their service techs (mostly excellent, knowledgeable, helpful, and goes the extra mile, with very few exceptions) Khaled continues to excel whenever he comes to service the equipment
3.5 *** for their installation techs. This time, they failed to ground the furnace and disconnect box - basic items that "should" to be done right the first time?! As a result, the "impossible to get hold of SJ City Inspection" failed, and more hassles to get the equipment certified.
3.0*** for the Customer Service - very friendly people, but not knowledgeable and has absolutely no power over their tyrannical Tech Dept. They will give many platitudes to placate the customer, but advise is to immediately request to talk to Tech Dept, otherwise one would have to repeat multiple times the same inputs since the Tech Dept almost never calls back after CS promises they will.
1.5** for Tech Dept. Does not call back until multiple escalation is made. Comes across as arrogant, not particularly helpful. They will fix the problem they created but only after one manages to get to them. (Monica seems to be the only responsive one in that department, Tye has not called back or responded at all both the times I had issues)
0.5* Sales. They will promise you the world, but disappears after the sale. In both my purchases, my Salesman promised a smooth process (ie installation and paperwork specifics - I was clear with my concerns then, and for this latest purchase, especially with the city certification, knowing the grief SJ City will cause). In the first case, they put it down to a "miscommunication" but they finally helped (after escalation) with the City Inspection.  Despite committing to "take care of inspection process and make it transparent to me", during the sales process, now I have a problem with City inspection, and they are nowhere to be found. I have called them but no call back, no sign of anything.

Now, I might expect Alicia or their CS manager to respond to this - seems like the response happens only the customer is extremely annoyed.

So should you go with them? IMHO for general maintenance, if you are not too particular about pricing, a convenient approach.
For new systems, imho "caveat emptor". Some days, you can be made to feel you are the center of their service. Other days just feel like it is too much work to be worth it. (like now)

But as a reminder to myself - I won't be silly to look here for my third upgrade! I really have to stop being so trusting!

Encounter 2: Oct 2019 >>Installation of 2 New ACs/1 Furnace + remedial work on missed installation items-failed City Inspection + subsequent maintenance work
** Update after multiple interactions... Not quite 5 Stars.. service and competency level varied across techs. Some problems encountered: installation of ac compressors not to city code. Minor rework needed. Missed a scheduled appointment totally. New ac compressor not cooling after 6 months. (imagine an approx $10k equipment not working after 6months!) LeamkimgLeaking coolant that couldn't be traced. No dye available to inject to trace leakage, have to return to redo. Problems to be expected but it just means tying up my time waiting for appointments, which I have to follow up on (did not call back to reschedule as promised) To be fair reasonably responsive, although their CS not very capable beyond the superficial greetings and perhaps scheduling work (even then).

Encounter 1: Fall 2019 :Service maintenance on old AC/Heaters
Khaled was the tech that helped me out today. Very timely, detailed in checking out all the issues and helpful with suggestions. Made very good observations and was very polite and kind.

This company seems to have done a good job training their staff and they seem to know what they are doing. Good job!</text>< pics>

Jeff and his co-worker Marc did a wonderful job.  They had to remove my old furnace and install the new.  The workspace is rather tight, but the new furnace was smaller in size, so that made things a little easier.  They were very knowledgeable about the product.  They made sure to tidy up the area before they left.  I was very satisfied with their service and would be happy to recommend them.</text>

Matt's installation crew was very competent, hard working and friendly. Perfection was promised, but that being hard to achieve, was not quite met. They worked 11 hours, and cleaned up pretty well considering the hours worked and time of day they ended, but we would have been REALLY impressed had someone come out the next day and spent about a half hour at the most for some minor cleanup. We should have done this sooner!</text>

I've worked with a lot of service companies over the years and so far nothing has come close to the service provided from Service Champions. They have contacted me the day before my appointment and even notified me when the serviceman was about 30 minutes from knocking on my door.  I had a  new heater/air conditioner combo installed along with new ducting under the house. The quality of work was superior and they also went over and beyond what they were required to do to make sure I was totally happy with their work . Each year I have them come out and inspect and tune up the unit and the service level has not changed. I also find that the service people are very knowledgeable, professional   and respectful. I will be calling them back next year when my servicing is due again.< /review>

Nam is the consummate professional!
I feel I could trust everything he said, in answer to my questions.
He was polite, courteous, respectful, well-informed and a delight to have on the job in my home.
I could not have asked for a more positive experience with a company representative, while having my furnace ducts replaced.
I HIGHLY recommend Nam!</review>

The first technition, Ben, was professional, polite & knowledgeable about his work.  He invited me out to see the furnace when it was apart & explained everything to me.  Nick came the nex day, had the same attributes &  gave me more information.  As an older woman, I was treated with respect & never talked down to as if I didn’t understand; everything was explained in detail.< /Review>

After giving a rave review on how quick they were, I came home to a freezing house and no way to operate my HVAC.  When I called @ 5:20 PM to inform them that they had left without returning my system to operation, I was simply told that I would have to wait until tomorrow morning as there was no one available.  Unbelievable and they call me a MVP customer.</Review>< Rating>

David came to my home and was courteous from the beginning. He told us what he was going to do, and asked us where everything was before he started. He began his work, and when he was done he went over everything with my wife and me. He told us the pricing for repairs and maintenance plan, and didn't push us to purchase anything. We are very satisfied with his service and recommend him highly.<//review>

He was patient with my dad who decided to last minute run to the store to try to grab another thermostat. And even though the visit wasn't intended for that purpose, David was willing to take the extra time to wire it in and install it. Once he was finished and had all his gear back in the van, he spent probably another 25 minutes at the table answering all my dads questions. Thanks David!

Kyle epitomizes customer service. His professional and personal demeanor made it a pleasure to have him service our central heating system. He pointed out every detail of his inspection and shared photos taken in support of his report findings. He made sure that i was extremely satisfied with his service and made sure that i was aware of all my inspection benefits that i was entitled to as a service champion customer.</text>

<Review>Dear Service Champions,

Dominic is an exemplary service champion. He took the time to inform me of the any pertinent issues with regards to my air conditioner. His thoroughness and description of the parts and how they worked was greatly appreciated. He is a true champion because of his stellar customer service. Thank you.<//Review>< Name>

Today my service was completed by Spencer Strand. From the start everything went as good as I would have expected from Service Champion. Spencer was extremely professional and well informed. He continued to keep me informed with each step he was preforming. I was very pleased with the entire service. Kudos to Spencer.< /review>

<text>Tyler S. was excellent.  Very friendly, knowledgeable, and did a good job of explaining things, even showing me the "inside your furnace firebox" view via the camera he brought.  He did not go through any high-pressure sell tactics to try and get me to buy things I didn't need, etc..   I highly recommend him.
---
Matt T. and his team were great re: our install.  Matt arrived early and went through everything with me, answering my questions, and then the team arrived and got to work.  We were able to continue to get things done at home while they were working and barely noticed they were there.  Excellent job, clean and professional.<//text></record>

Luis Facio came to perform a furnace and water heater repair tune-up today.  He arrived on time, was extremely courteous, and was very professional.  He took the time to show me as well as explain exactly what the furnace issues were.  He also left the area tidy when he had completed the job.  I would highly recommend Luis to perform the furnace inspection and tune-up from this company.< /review>

He has a personality that puts you to ease while he is here.  I would recommend him to any one needing the service he supplies.  He is through, explaining the job he is doing, letting us know every part of the service.  The new tool that he used to show us the leaking air coming in from the attic was amazing.

The way they bill for refrigerant is ridiculous.  Especially if you use more than the first min amount.  They should charge by pound, not force you to buy blocks of 4 lbs of refrigerant at $65 per pound. Discounted.
The service rep was good, I just don't like the company bill process.
It feels like your are being taken advantage of.</Text>

<Review>Service Champions installed the furnace in our house four years ago and they were hands down one of the very best teams we have ever worked with in twenty years of owning homes. They just stopped by this week to assess air leakage and insulation and once again a great team of professionals.  Highly recommend.<//Review>< Pictures>

My furnace stopped working and Service Champions was able to get a repair person to my house within 48 hours. Caleb B. arrived on time and was able to diagnose the problem based on my description. His diagnosis proved correct and he had the part to fix it on the spot. Caleb took time to answer all of my questions. He completed the job quickly and offered to vacuum the floor when he was done. Overall, a very good experience for me.</text>

<Review>One of the best experiences that I have had in getting something completed for my home.  He arrived within the time frame given, he was courteous, clean, friendly, and knowledable.  He explained what he did and took pictures of what needed to be done.  He was not pushy in selling me more but presented great opportunities for me to save money.  Not something that I say frequently; this was the best experience I have had taking care of my old charming house.  Would highly recommend Service Champions and this man in particular.</Review><Gmap_id>0x808fec098826f14b:0x488fa2d94bbaad01</Gmap_id></record>

He carefully checked everything up and asked the questions about how we feel the  furnace and air condition performed during the year. He made a good suggestions for us and try to help us solve the problems. He also made another appointment for us because of raining outside he could not complete to tune up for the compressor.

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Andres and his partner Hung were prompt, professional, friendly, and fast!  In and out in about 5 hours, installing a new hot water heater and a new AC condenser.  They put up with me asking questions and were always spot-on with their answers.  I have a background in big mainframe computers, so their answers were easily understandable and made sense.

A minor leak occurred at the hot side outlet from the H2O heater, and I believe it was Jordan P. who came out the next day to fix it.  Easy money!

There's a reason why we have continued using SERVICE CHAMPIONS for the last 15 years or so, and it's because of techs like Andres, Hung, and Jordan.

April 28...Just completed a furnace and air tune by Service Champions and Juan Solis, expert engineer.  My experience was excellent and Juan is super knowledgeable and easy to work with.  Gave my furnace and air conditioner a complete tune up and even helped address a small duct problem in the attic. Very thorough and competent. I will deal with this firm again. very pleased with the work<//Review>

Ben and his crew replaced our heater, air conditioner, and thermostat.  They arrived on time, reviewed what they were going to do, and explained everything very personably and knowledgeably.  Their cleanliness and respectfulness throughout the process was much appreciated, as it was a very long day and there was a lot to do.  But everything was completed and they cleaned up very well before they departed.  Exceptional work and service as always.</review>

David Shelton was a very polite and efficient representative for Service Champions.  He did his job in a timely manner, explained all the details of his examination and let us ask questions (which he answered in layman's language for "senior" citizens).  We were very pleased with his service.  He also was on time for his appointment.< /review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><rating>5< /rating><review>What a wonderful company to work with. Tyler Shook was courteous and professional in his evaluation of our furnace and hot water heater (both over 30 years old). He took pictures of the problem areas, answered questions and was polite in his suggestions. He worked fast and clean, a real pleasure to have in our home.

We elected to get a new heating system and hot water heater before we had an emergency on our hands. Mark Andrade gave us helpful advice in choosing our new system. He was professional, courteous, and did not pressure us into our choice.

The installation team lead by Washington Dang, again, were fast, clean, courteous and a pleasure to have in our home. I cannot recommend this team more highly.

I originally called Service Champions based on reviews, etc. (you can see my prior review here.) Just as before the service was EXCELLENT.  This was the 2nd visit, this time for a full heating and cooling tune up.  Richard Y was the technician and was very helpful and thorough. He went out of his way to look for problems and find solutions.  Based on 2 great experiences, I highly recommend this company.  I'm very satisfied with the service provided today! Thanks!< /Text>

Called Service Champions out to the house to address my neglected AC units. They arrived on time as promised.  Ian Hazelwood was the tech assigned to the call and was very professional and informative during his inspection. He was able to quickly diagnose  the problem and made required repairs. The company provides up front pricing, which gives you comfort of knowing your expense and of course eliminates the surprise of additional cost over the quote.

Thanks Service Champions & Ian, you've won over another happy customer !!!<//review>

Robert Tanaka (Walnut Creek) was a first class professional.  He arrived on time, was very thorough, and explained every thing he was doing in an easy-to-understand way.  When he was working in areas where I didn't follow to see (like under the house), he took pictures to show and explain.  He was very friendly, and proactive in making suggestions on ways to improved the system.  Robert was a pleasure to work with.< /Review>

<review>Lyndy would get a 5 for trying. Maintenance would get a 4, sometimes a 5 (depending on who is here).. So far installation of the new HVAC system has been a not so good experience. Sloppy. Not good follow-up. This, so far, has been very disappointing.< /review>< userid>

<Review>Shaun O. serviced our air and heating condition just after we moved into a home new to us. He discovered that our 16 year old system had never been serviced beyond keeping clean filters in place. He was thorough in cleaning up any potential problems, left the system looking like new and advised us as to what our options were regarding keeping or replacing the system. If we were to keep current system what concerns we should be aware of. At our request he installed a new thermostat and after fully servicing the system, he made certain all was in running order. He was polite, friendly, businesslike, personable and knowledgeable. I have had Service Champions as my go-to service for over 16 years or about the same time the company started up. We are a silver member where for a small monthly fee we are entitled at no additional cost to a summer and winter checkup on our systems to make sure all is running properly and to prevent any possible problems. Each of the employees I have dealt with over the years have sung praises to the company they work for which speaks volumes to me.< /Review>< user>

If you are looking for a company that backs up what they say, you have found them.  We have been using them for maintenance for 3+ years, and they do excellent work, explain everything fully, and look for additional value for us.  We have known the ductwork needed to be replaced in our 50 year old home.  Chris brought a program that made sense and now we are waiting for the installers.  He was honest, thorough, and when we said "not right now", he listened.  When we were ready, he came back, explained all over again and we were able to make the right decision.  No hard sell here, just honesty and great over-all customer service. You will not be sorry if you choose this company.< /text>

<review>Lee Ward was a most delightful young man, and extremely well informed.
I have had Service Champions for many years, and always appreciate it when the service person is helpful and explains everything.

I will say this however trying to give him a good report wasn't easy, most complicated system for doing this, you should make it easier!</review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response>< time>

These guys are always on time, they tell you about not only current issues but potential issues and their prices are always available in advance.  Their MVP program includes a free checkup twice a year and their employees are all friendly and helpful.  I had Chris Meyer today and he was very helpful and knowledgeable.</Review>

Service Champions turned a really bad situation into a really good one in the end. Sometimes you learn more about the integrity of a company and its employees when a problem arises. What my wife and I learned is that we can trust Service Champions to do the right thing and put the needs of its customers ahead of anything else. Everyone, from the person that I talked with on the phone to the technician that serviced our air conditioner, was professional, attentive and empathetic with our situation. As a result, they fixed our air conditioner in a timely manner and provided us with a job well done! I genuinely recommend Service Champions to anyone that is looking for a first class company to tend to your heating and air needs. If I could give them 10 stars . . . I would.< /review>

Also, on Nov. 6, 2019 Pablo and his partner sealed all of my ducts in the attic etc.  They were both extremely hard workers and spent a lot of time making sure that I didn't have any air leaks to handle both my Heating as well as my A/C.  Thanks again to Service Champions who I highly recommend for your HVAC needs.

Also, on June 18, 2020 Service Champions technician Ben Fuller has serviced my HVAC on several occasions. I feel that he has done an outstanding job keeping my HVAC working very efficiently. Besides his technical skills, he has an outstanding personality. Thank you Service Champions and Ben Fuller.</text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Zack came to perform an HPT on my ducts to find leaks and see how my house breathes. He was very helpful and super knowledgeable. He even taught me that I should flush my hot water heater regularly to prevent sediment build-up, which had nothing to do with why he was there but again - super helpful knowledgeable guy! Always a great experience with this company.< /text>

Brian explained the several different options and advised me to schedule an appointment to have a free analysis of my condo and the best choice of AC in case I need a replacement since  the current systems is ancient.

<rating>5<//rating><review>I had the pleasure of having Luis and Bob servicing our furnace.  Both guys were easy to talk to, were personable and had a pleasant attitude.  They were punctual, showed up in time as communicated by their back office.

When they started working on the heating system, they had a well documented plan, easy for me to see and confirm what they were up to.  After taking the furnace apart -- before reassembling it -- Luis showed me the state of the various parts and explained quite a bit about the workings of our furnace.

I think that Service Champions has a well thought out and clear pricing plan, so there were no surprises about the cost of things.   In all I thought having the furnace serviced by Service Champions was a very transparent process, and I liked their company filosofie.</review>< Pics>

Luis came earlier than his scheduled time, diagnosed the problem right away, explained variously options we have, proceeded to fix the problem and clean the compressor after we made our choice.  He was friendly, polite, knowledgeable,  and meticulous.  He must have changed the shoe covers on and off five or more times when he had to go in and out of the house.   In short time,  our air conditioner came to life and our house is cool again.  He made sure that he answered all our questions before he left.  It was such a pleasant experience working with Luis!<//Review>

<review>Pedro C did the maintenance review on the heating/air conditioning/water heater installed at the beginning of this year.  He arrived with notice and on time and performed a thorough evaluation of the units, ducts, vents, filters, etc. After another run-through of how the system works, he made recommendations on ongoing care we can provide as well as programs provided by Service Champions.  In addition to his professionalism, Pedro is personable and pleasant to work with.  We've been pleased with attitude and competence of all the folks at Service Champions!<//review>< pics>

<Review>Steve Corsaro was professional, knowledgeable, courteous, and very clean.  He kept me informed about what he was doing as he did a comprehensive checkout of both my furnace and air conditioning.  He was up front about what various items would cost and helped me to decide whether I needed to recharge my air conditioner or not (I did).  Give him a raise.<//Review><Name>Michael Belchik<//Name></record></dataset><record>

Austin U. of Service Champions was very pleasant to work with. He efficiently took the necessary time to inspect our heating/air conditioning systems, including duct work. He then explained, with pictures what were his findings and answered all questions clearly. I would recommend him and Service Champions; we have had nothing but good experiences.</Review>

This is my second year with Service Champions.  I haven't had to call them for emergency service, but when my annual service is due, they are on top of it.   Shaun is very personable and included me with explanations of what was being checked during the 'clean up' of my unit.  I feel confident that  I was made aware of the potential problems and to what to watch for.< /Review>

Brandon I did the initial inspection and service, excellent and did explain his findings every step of the way as well as areas for improvement.  He did an above and beyond service job..nice young man.  Chris Lucas followed up, after the service area manager came by to confirm Brandon's finding (big crack in furnace).  Chris was very personable and very down to earth, he explained everything and gave me three options for repair.  He included what each option entailed.  He was wonderful to have in my home. Andres, did the installation all by himself, which was an massive undertaking.  He worked very, very hard.  The installation should of been an two man job.  Overall, I am very happy with the service provided and would of signed up for the yearly agreement sooner if I had met your techicians. They are a team that companies search for and hire.  You are lucky to have such excellent, remarkable, skilled, and polite employees such as these young men.  Congraduations, on a job
well done....I am happy< /Review>

Our technician for this system tune up was Nick Witte. Nick arrived within the window we were told to expect (both online and telephonic reminders), and was very personable and professional throughout the service. He offered to answer any questions we had regarding the system and it's operating performance. He also asked for any issues we might have had with the system since the last tune up. He also informed us of additional services they had to offer, which we were able to schedule free due to our membership in their club membership program.

We have been very satisfied with all the technicians and the company as a whole since we have been customers of Service Champions.<//text>

<Review>Our outside A/C unit stopped working a couple of days ago.  The customer service was very prompt and friendly and got an appointment for me in 2 days.  When the technician came out he seemed knowledgeable and knew right away what was needed.  I was a little shocked when he quoted me $488 to fix a capacitor (part itself was $20).  I understand labor and overhead on top of the part cost but $488 and the $69 for the service call seemed steep.  I had a capacitor fixed previously on another unit and the cost was around $150.  I will shop around more next time as I think they are overpriced.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x808fec098826f14b:0x488fa2d94bbaad01< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

we were having trouble with our thermostat so they came out for our routine inspection which was do. It wasn't Brandons first time around the block, he knew just what to do and was very professional. Put booties on and a blanket to protect our floor. Would have no problem having him back again.

In general Service Champions hires former military personal. Neatly dressed, polite and on time. So far we have been very pleased.< /text>

Service Champions replaced my 20 year old five ton air conditioner with a far more efficient Lennox unit and they did the job the next day after I ordered the unit. Installers Todd C. and Andres F did an excellent job and also installed smoke detectors in bedrooms and a CO 2 Detector in hall way. Very pleased with the company.<//Text>

Brandon was the nicest, and most courteous technician that I have ever had in my home. He explained everything and completed the job in a timley manner. He even took the time to play a few tunes on the piano with my wife. We will ask for him on all future calls.

<Text>Brian was very knowledgeable about our entire heating and air conditioning system. I had no idea that our duct system was over 20yrs old and not meant for air conditioning. All the problems that we were experiencing, low air flow to the back of the house and dust, are attributed to the years of damage and leakage in our system. Brian was able to convey all of this with out confusion and in a way that I was able to understand. Overall it was a very informative and rather quick appointment.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I want to comment on our service experience with Brandon.  It is very nice to have a young man come into our home with great attitude, experience and ease of communication.  He went about hid work professionally, quickly, and thoroughly.  When a problem came up, he was able to explain the problem, its symptoms and a couple of solutions, no pressure salesmanship.  We felt very confident that the corrective action fixing the issues was valuable to fix.  He is a great asset to the company he works for, and will raise Service Champion’s satisfaction rating.  Thanks for sending him out and we will ask for his services in the future.  Martin Birnie (Concord)<//Text>

Service Champions were again very thoughtful of our comfort as well as getting a new furnace installed as quickly as possible over a weekend.  They even brought us 2 very good space heaters to help us stay warm as the nights were very cold.</Review>

The technician, his name Willington,  was prompt, knowledgable, courteous and friendly. He offered his recommendations without pushing any agenda. I would highly recommend his services and will call on him next time we need our AC or furnace inspected.</Text>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Text>We have utilized Service Champions several times over the last few years and have always been extremely pleased with their performance. Today's experience was no exception.
Easy to reach office staff, reasonably available appointments within acceptable time frames and considerate communication prior to the technician's arrival.
The technician, Dominic R., arrived right at the beginning of the appointment window and was personable and professional, explaining the components of today's service (seasonal inspection/tune-up) and providing an accurate time estimate for him to complete his tasks.
Upon completion of the service/inspection, Dominic took time to explain his findings, providing the customary copy of the report of the service provided. We appreciated his friendly manner and the lack of the hard up-sell while at the same time alerting us to the cost saving and preventive maintenance plans available for consideration.
If you are looking for someone to perform heating and/or AC work you should check these folks out.< /Text>< UserId.>

<text>Professional friendly very customer service oriented. Helpful and knowledgeable. Kaleo Spalding conducted the inspection in a timely manner.  He and Chris Meyer took special care not to soil my carpet. Chris was thoughtful and even changed my battery's on my thermostat.

I was busy taking knots out of my festive decor lights and he helped.

Both professionals were very considerate. Service champions are very fortunate to have them working for them. Thank you.</text></record>

Today, Brandon M., of Service Champions Sacramento, serviced my Air Conditioning and Water Heater systems. It was a very positive experience, as always, as he has been to my house previously. Brandon is very professional and personable. I find him to be very honest in his evaluations and I highly recommend him as a HVAC service specialist. Knowing that he is an expert, honesty is the most important factor for me, and I am confident that Brandon is indeed an honest person.</Text>

On 8/25/17 Ben Carter came to figure out a recurring drainage problem. Water was consistently flowing from the pan overflow pipe above and just outside our front door instead of the primary pipe into the ground a few feet away. Thinking out of the box, Ben determined that air was forcing the water in the wrong direction, and that he needed to replumb the pvc drainage system in the attic. This he did quickly and efficiently, and everything has been working great ever since. Ben was friendly, explained what he was doing clearly, and Service Champions should be proud of him.<//Text>

Brian Kirby performed an inspection/service on my furnace and air systems on 5/12/16.  He arrived in the time specified and went about all his work in a professional and pleasant manner.  He even went above and beyond and installed some smoke detector batteries for me.  I  have trouble climbing and have not been able to change them for quite some time.  It was a nice experience throughout. I thought I was posting this to the Concord area but now find I'm on Pleasanton so will try to post over on the correct area.<//text>

<Review>I had the opportunity to meet with Gabriel Galindez this morning and was very favorably impressed with not only his technical expertise, but also his interpersonal skills,  He was thorough, knowledgeable, courteous, and patient.  He even waited patiently in our driveway at our house as we were half an hour late for our appointment.

I immediately felt at ease with Gabriel and believed I could trust him. At that point, I really didn't care about a competitors bid, the cost, or the technical details of the job.  I just wanted to do business with Gabriel because he was impressive.  I believe in the motto that you do business with people you like, and as i said earlier he was not only knowledgeable and skilled about ducts,insulation, heating, etc. but he related to me as a person and spoke to me like we had been friends for years.

I highly recommend Gabriel and hope you recognize him as a valuable employee of your company,<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

The experience was fantastic!  The two young men Andres and Hung were courteous, respectful, very friendly, explained things clearly no matter how many times I interrupted them, and showed no attitude or impatience whatsoever.  They took their time and did the job right, even cleaning up after themselves, and making sure things were exactly the way they encountered them.  I was a tad bit late from going to the grocery store before they came, and even then, the patience and kindness was still evident.  Andres even offered to help me bring in my groceries, which was the first time that has ever happened in my experience with contractors.  That in itself is enough to keep me using Service Champions for all my heating and air conditioning needs.  Keep up the good work in hiring, training and maintaining such wonderful employees.  They both get an A++++++ in my book!

Thank you,

<review>Nicholas  was extremely thorough on the system checkup.  Also very friendly and courteous.  We had the little Grandkids over and he took time to show them what he was going to do and talked with them a bit. They asked a few questions and then left him alone to do his thing.

<Review>Richard F did an excellent joy servicing and cleaning our furnace on June 29.  He explained everything he was doing and took care to complete his work well then checked how well the furnace was performing thourghout our house.  He also suggested and set up a scheduled a home performance test so we can see if there are any areas that could be improved to make our home more energy efficient.  I enjoyed his good positive energy.  He definitely enjoys his work.

Juan is a very personable young man who met all of my service expectations and more.  Juan explained everything he was doing and answered all of my questions to my complete satisfaction.  He checked everything in the HVAC system and pronounced it to be in good shape based on his measurements and inspection.  I never felt he was rushing to just get through the inspection and he left our house at about the scheduled time.  I would welcome Juan back to our home for HVAC service any time.  I could not give a better review for the service he performed.<//Review>

Only hitch: the office did not inform Brandon that I wanted a new thermostat in addition to the regular service inspection, so he's going to have to make a second trip for that.</Review>< pics>

<Review>Joel A. did a superb job inspecting central AC and heat. He was able to explain everything in very understandable terms and did not try to up-sell anything. I am very pleased with the service.< /Review>< pics>

Made me feel comfortable and well informed about the heating and cooling system I needed for my home. He was very knowledgeable about the programs available in my area to help with costs. I was so amazed with how quickly the process was. One day, he is at my home telling me everything and the very next day, it's all getting installed! Wow! Glad I chose this company. Great customer service and quick installation! Yaaay!<//text>< Resp>

<review>This cleaning I had Richard F. he was through and gave me the inspection and cleaning that I was expecting when I got my service contract.  This was a much more through cleaning and explanation of how things work than I had ever had before. I was actually
thinking of canceling my appointment and canceling my contract before Richard came. He is friendly and not high pressure , but just right. he makes you comfortable with your chooses. I will be asking for him the next time I schedule my next cleaning.< /review>< gmap_id>

<Text>We have a terrible 8 year old Westinghouse heater.  I called Service Champions (among others) and they sent David Shelton out to diagnose our problems.  He was the only tech to do a complete check.  He was pleasant and patient with his description of our problem areas.  I will definitely use Service Champions whenever my new heater needs service (I'll probably get the new heater from them as well).<//Text>< Pics>

James P. did a very good job inspecting our furnace/AC system and answering our questions. We were happy he discovered we had a problem and he arranged for a follow-up visit to make a repair.  Hopefully our next annual visit will result in a clean report with no additional problems.< /Review>

Ben Carter was my Service Rep today and I was very pleased with his attitude and work.  He is very much a people person and took a lot of time to answer my questions, adjust my thermostat and inform me of what he did at the end.  When I have work done in the future I will ask for Ben specifically.

My AC stopped working a day ago and it was 96 degrees out side. Called at 6pm and had a tech out the next day (pretty fast). He diagnosed the problem quickly and I was up and running within an hour and a half.

Great customer service!!< /review>

While I have your attention:   I have been trying for a couple years for your office to send my 2236 Sand Point Discovery Bay turkey offer to my other  home 4551 Alhambra Way Martinez.    We don't get mail in Discovery BAy.   I donate my turkeys to the Food Bank in Concord.

We had the pleasure of having our Air Conditioning and Heating ducts checked for leaks and general condition by Spencer Strand. He has a great demeanor and very friendly and extremely knowledgeable.

He did a thorough inspection of our furnace, even washed our filter. He brought some issues to our attention made us feel that the maintenance was professionally conducted.

He has our strongest recomendation.<//Text><Name>Eleni Paris<//Name></record></dataset><record>

Brian was on time, quick with his work and a pleasure to dialogue with. Kudos to "Service Champions" for having intelligent and dedicated employees in the service field!!!!
We have had several other Service Champions technicians at our house. All of them are "Quality people". It was worth paying a little extra for excellent service.

I would like to suggest the appointment maker I talked to on Thursday [11-5-15] to make sure details are correct. Making a Friday appointment, but telling me it was for Thursday caused me grief I didn't need. So please refrain from making such mistakes.</text>

On  Wednesday June 15, 2016.
I had my annual inspection for the AC's and the furnaces for 2 locations today.  This was the first time I met Juan S. I am happy to report that his service was excellent.

He is courteous; a great teacher;  (he explained how to start the furnace after the filter was washed and dried.  The instruction booklet was confusing.)  And everything now appears to be in great working condition.

I was also impressed that he examined the water heater as well the furnace and air conditioning units and found they possibly needed further repair or replacement.

He remained professional at all times.

I would like to have him do my next regular inspection in October.

Thanks,

Gordon Osser< /Text>

Hi
I have been your customer for years, and I must tell you it has been a wonderful experience.  Today Pedro C. was the tech for servicing my furnace and air conditioner.
On time as usual, very profesional and a pleasure.
All of your people are pro's and a pleasure to deal with.
I also thank you for your wonderful turkeys for Thanksgiving day you send every year.
What a nice thing to do. I always send you a thank you card, but want to take this opportunity to thank you again.
You all are terrific, and so is Service Champions.

Best regards,
Wynn Gilligan< /Text>

Marc DePretis is a total professional.  He appeared at my door with a wide smile and in a neat well groomed uniform.  After covering his shoes he inspected my thermostat and furnace all the while explaining everything in great detail.  He was a total pleasure to have in my home and is a credit to your company.  He also endeavered to assist me with an affordable way to purchase a new furnace and A/C unit as mine are extremely out dated.  If he hasn't had one recently I would definitely consider giving this man a raise!!</review>

We found him to be very pleasant and polite and were impressed with his thoroughness and attention to detail while being in our home. He was well groomed and performed his work with great detail to neatness and care for our furniture and household furnishings while working.

A very nice young man that left my wife and I with a feeling that the service call was well performed.and We thoroughly enjoyed meeting him.

Most service calls are not described as a pleasant experience. However this was definitely a pleasant experience!

On  Wednesday June 15, 2016.
I had my annual inspection for the AC's and the furnaces for 2 locations today.  This was the first time I met Juan S. I am happy to report that his service was excellent.

He is courteous; a great teacher;  (he explained how to start the furnace after the filter was washed and dried.  The instruction booklet was confusing.)  And everything now appears to be in great working condition.

I was also impressed that he examined the water heater as well the furnace and air conditioning units and found they possibly needed further repair or replacement.

He remained professional at all times.

I would like to have him do my next regular inspection in October.

Thanks,

Gordon Osser</Review>

<review>I have found Service Champions to be a very professional company in servicing and providing information about my heating and cooling system.  Their representative, Luis Facio, was courteous, knowledgeable and friendly.

I found their products to be reasonably priced and the options available to meet my needs.  I would highly recommend their services for any heating and cooling needs.

<text>It can be confusing when you need an HVAC company. I have you service champions in two separate counties now. And I have purchased equipment from them in both locations as well. The phone service and professionalism in Danville caused us to call them in Los Gatos. It was a great decision. We have units on the roof so you want to hire someone who understands the difficulty replacing this unit. Both the installation and the after sales service has been outstanding. If you are looking for a really quality organization call Service Champions.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1528824511126, 'text': 'Thank you for leaving a review!

I thought the worst when our central heating unit wouldn't start on a cold morning.  Called Service Champions and that afternoon. Ben showed up with a big smile.  In no time at all, our situation was remedied.  Job well done!</text>

<UserId.>111327719489873414746< /UserId.><Review>A Mr. Chris Meyer arrived at my house in 20 minutes and I thought it would take all day.  I was very surprised.  He was quick and efficient and he located the problem within less than 5 minutes.  Needed a part and he explained the problem and said he would be back with the new part between 4 and 6.  He was back at 3:00 clock and the problem was fix at 3:02 and we had heat.  I have always had a good experience with Service Champions and highly recommend them to any one who need a new heater and service.  He also explained a service deal which we took to save money and be hear in 6 months to give us a tune up and inspection.  I now have nothing to worry about.<//Review><Response>None< /Response></record>

I want to say that Vinhson Huynh was by far the BEST technician I have had for anything in a long Time. Give him a raise! He is a prince! BTW, Service Champions is the BEST also! I am totally satisfied with the work!

<Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp><review>Well, we had a Furnace Tune-up service from Service champions one month ago, and everything was checked out in perfect condition.
But guess what? Last night when it was cold and we turned the system on for the first time after the check-up, NONE of our two systems worked!

Called Service Champion, first they said they would charge an inspection fee, then they said their first availability will be 4 days later!  After pushing further, they finally "found" an opening much sooner.  We will see what their diagnose comes out to be, but how could it be that BOTH of our units stopped working after their tune-up service?

I want to send a word of caution - watch out for those inexpensive tune-ups!  We thought we are doing a preventive service, but there is a risk that some technician can do real damage to your systems!< /review></record></dataset><record>

I appreciate enhancing my knowledge about how to properly maintain the heat, air, and duct systems.  Thank you, Patrick of Service Champions.

It hit the main sprinkler system & broke two of the PVC pipe heads right off.  Water was spraying everywhere. Travis came down off the roof, found the main water valve & turned off the water.  After he completed his survey of my HVAC system he helped me re-tape the air filter that had come apart with proper tape. He then went to his truck to pull out a box of PVC pipes, cutters and proper glue.  He was able to immediately replace the two heads that were torn off and get our water running again.  I really appreciated his graciousness while I was dealing with a very personal adverse situation that had really upset me. I greatly appreciated his willingness to go the extra mile.  We would have gone without water until I could have gotten an emergency plumber and, paid extra money to have the pipes fixed.  He did it in minutes!  My son was truly sorry to have caused such a problem.

Travis, thank you again for your service, you're the best!

<rate>3</rate><Review>Thinking of the overall experience of evaluating the HVAC system, I'm only neutral because the system is working well for our needs, but each time a technician comes to check it out, much of the time is spent trying to show that the system should be replaced.  Very little time is spent improving or repairing.  As an example:  there is always some rust in areas where condensate collects.  No time has ever been used cleaning it off and maybe spraying the area with a rust converter (which there are many of now).  The extractor fan impellor is easily miss-aligned and occasionally rubs on the housing.  Someone could have replaced the soft mounting parts.  Instead I quite often have to re-align the unit after the tech leaves and the furnace starts for the first time.
Nick is obviously a very well trained technician, and it was a good experience talking with him and seeing him check out both the condensing system and the furnace.  However, the focus has always been on evaluating for purposes of replacement.  I'd like to see more emphasis on maintenance and repair with the goal of extending the life of my investment.  So far I feel like I've paid a lot for diagnostics and evaluation.
Your prices for replacement of the system are not competitive.
This "maintenance program" doesn't seem to be working for me.

That was from prior visits.
Lee's visit was somewhat  better.  He listened and responded to my interests in the system.  However I still had to adjust the small fan as before.  An after closure heat check would have saved me having to open it up and adjusting it to get it to run.  Lee has excellent knowledge of the system.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x808fec098826f14b:0x488fa2d94bbaad01< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Thinking of the overall experience of evaluating the HVAC system, I'm only neutral because the system is working well for our needs, but each time a technician comes to check it out, much of the time is spent trying to show that the system should be replaced.  Very little time is spent improving or repairing.  As an example:  there is always some rust in areas where condensate collects.  No time has ever been used cleaning it off and maybe spraying the area with a rust converter (which there are many of now).  The extractor fan impellor is easily miss-aligned and occasionally rubs on the housing.  Someone could have replaced the soft mounting parts.  Instead I quite often have to re-align the unit after the tech leaves and the furnace starts for the first time.
Nick is obviously a very well trained technician, and it was a good experience talking with him and seeing him check out both the condensing system and the furnace.  However, the focus has always been on evaluating for purposes of replacement.  I'd like to see more emphasis on maintenance and repair with the goal of extending the life of my investment.  So far I feel like I've paid a lot for diagnostics and evaluation.
Your prices for replacement of the system are not competitive.
This "maintenance program" doesn't seem to be working for me.

That was from prior visits.
Lee's visit was somewhat  better.  He listened and responded to my interests in the system.  However I still had to adjust the small fan as before.  An after closure heat check would have saved me having to open it up and adjusting it to get it to run.  Lee has excellent knowledge of the system.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Michael S. came out to do the annual check on the HVAC - on time, did a very complete check and cleaning of the heating system and checked the A/C since its repair this summer.  Made sure all was ready for the coming winter.  Very professional and would want him back to do any other service when it is needed.<//text>

Luis Rivas  showed up for filter change and  he also test the condenser and furnace - showed me pictures and test results which was very helpful. He also troubleshoot my A/C distribution problem. Showed the R factor of the insulation and duct issues which I was unaware of. How the insulation was only 19 when I’d paid for the insulation of R38!! Good to know and making it clear why my house was heating up or cooling down so soon during weather changes and why my room was always always too warm or too cold because of its duct being compressed in the attic.  I was able to finally see my attic through the pictures and have a better idea of how to improve things.
Luis was so helpful and easy to talk with.  Been with service champions forever and they keep getting better...<//Text>

Demitri J. came to fix my heater. Totally friendly and competent service with a smile, on time and on schedule. Performed system clean up in addition to the service call he was booked for.
If Service Champions does not send Demitri to Las Vegas, the competition is totally rigged! Best service I have had in this house in last 20 years with a host of different companies. I mean this!< /Review>

Tyler arrived on time and went right to work. He checked the parts of and assessed the efficiency of our heater and air conditioner units and our water heater. I followed him throughout, asking questions. He answered knowledgeably and courteously and encouraged me to understand what he was doing and why.

When he finished, I called my partner, Alice Latimer, and the three of us went over his report, our options, and the MVP Plan. He wasn't pushy about selling the plan, but given what he said about our units, I opted for the 3-year Gold plan. Once I had done so, he installed a Nest thermostat and showed me how to download the iPhone and iPad app and how to use it.

I was sorry to learn that he won't be our "regular guy" from Service Champions. He also connected me to Shannon, who set up an appointment for Pete to come over next week to discuss new units, so we can be prepared if the worst occurs.<//review>

He was dressed very professionally and I noticed his shirt and pants seemed to have been recently pressed.  As it turns out, Brian is a former Marine, which explains his appearance.  Brian was called to diagnose an air conditioning problem.  In no time he had tested my system and made his diagnoses.  The details of the diagnoses was fully explained, he was given the okay, and the problem was fixed in a matter of minutes.  Without question, Brian knows heating and air, and in the future, I would request he be the only one who works on my system.  Thank you Brian, Great Job.

<Date>1438720042319<//Date><review>JC did our annual inspection of the heating and AC unit.  I mentioned to him a problem about the noisy condensate pump and the fact that the condensate line froze a few winters back.  He did a thorough review of the situation and came up with some solutions. Very thoughtful and said that he was here to solve my problems.  And he really put forth the effort.  Excellent service tech- I wish all service techs could be as thorough and straight forward.

<review>Service Chumps (SC) visited the house, took measurements and was supposed to give me a price.  Verbal estimate between 7-8 thousand. I got an estimate from another company and forward the estimate to SC and their "lowest price guarantee" went out the window.  They claimed the price quoted was unreasonable.  SC never actually gave me a written quote they just tag teamed with a closing manager.  When asked if they would match quoted price they said 'no'.  Pays to get additional bids-- a $2000.00 difference.</review>< Rating>

<Date>1437333348446<//Date><rate>5< /rate><Review>Fortunately, I got a HVAC quote from Service Champions shortly before my circa 1970s unit finally gave up the ghost.  Nicholas G. was very helpful and professional in setting up my quote, set up my rebates and Ygrene financing (5 years financing is cheaper than cash, because the payments come out of your property tax, which is deductible to the IRS); when it turned out the unit he'd quoted wouldn't quite fit the site, he upgraded it without extra charge, and he expedited the installation when we came back from vacation to find the old unit completely seized up.  Shawn and Adam installed the new unit and were friendly, neat and efficient; they also installed the new Nest thermostat that came with the system.  Chaz followed up with a duct test, and installed a new CO2 monitor and 4 new smoke alarms.  All-in-all, an excellent experience!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x808fec098826f14b:0x488fa2d94bbaad01</GmapID></record>

When our Amana furnace heat exchanger was diagnosed with hairline cracks by our regular service company, we asked Service Champions to give us a second opinion.

On 10/10, Tyler Shook inspected our heater and did not find a failure but showed me that it was worn and stressed after 17 years of use. I asked to speak with a salesman, so he called his office and Chris Lucas arrived a few minutes later. Both Chris and Tyler spent 2 hours helping me choose a new heat pump/furnace system that fit well with our existing solar panel installation. I was very pleased with the knowledge and care that Tyler and Chris showed in helping me find the best/efficient  system to fit our budget.

Washington Dang arrived on 10/13 with his assistant to install our new HVAC system. They both worked steadily for 11 hours to complete the work and explain the system to us. We are very pleased with our new system and the way it was installed by Washington,  We look forward to it passing inspection and testing by the City of Pleasant Hill. Tyler, Chris, and Washington all did very well for me and Service Champions.

2/8/19 Candace Baca did a great job yesterday with her inspection, evaluation and presentation of repair or replacement of our HVAC duct system. Based on her presentation, we have decided to go with the full replacement alternative.  Thanks Candace!</Text>

<Review>Juan Solis was out to our house this morning to perform the safety inspection on our hvac system. Everything checked out a-ok and only took about an hour. Juan was an extremely polite and friendly service technician. Thanks, Juan, we don't want a system breakdown when the temps hit 90's - 100's,  here in Livermore!<//Review>< name>

The service technician ,Steven Cook  arrived on time Monday, May 8th to install two Air Scrubber's providing me with the ability to have cleaner air. As I have COPD this installation was very important. Steven was able to install the first Air Scrubber with no trouble. The second one required a unique solution eventually placing under the house. Steven stuck with the problem until he has successful installed both units. I would say that he certainly went above and beyond to get the work done.

<review>Had my furnace replaced by Service Champions on 9/27/2016.
First I want to get on the record  that the two installers were curteous, professional, respectful and knowledgable.
The SC moto is if you are not happy its free! Im not looking for anything free but do want to share my total expertience. I told both men that I was extremely picky and expected the quality of the removal and installation to be perfect; quality of workmanship, cleanliness, protection of surrounding infrastructure, door jams interion of heater closet and enrty / exit doorway etc.
There were three issues with the installation that I was not happy with.
1. The door jams and interior cabinet drywall were damaged with the removal and installation . These areas should have been protected with tape or barriers before the work started.
2. The heater closet door was left with greese handprints inside an outside as was the door used to enter and exit the work area.
3. The new thermostat was not mounted  flush with the wall. The plastic molly dry wall inserts were sticking out about 1/8 inch and therefore the thermostat wall plate did not sit flush against the wall. I had to remove the thermostat to fill the old mounting holes and to paint the area because the new thermostat is smaller than the old thermostat. I had to replace the plastic molly inserts and reinstall the thermostat.
I did not catch thes issues until i got home at the end of the day. I was not at home for the whole installation process.
It is clear that these service representatives are well trained and capable technically but I expected a higher level of overall attention to detail. That level of attention is most likely not taught in the training they receive and in my opinion has to be part of the basic makeup of the individual, part of his personal performance DNA if you will.
Overall I was comfortable with the work done and would have Service Champions back in my house. I am a gold member, SC does the yearly system inspections and services my HVAC units.  They are not the least expensive HVAC contractor out there by far so my performance expectations are higher when the price is higher.</review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Had high hopes as setting up the appointment and their confirmation process was great. Not going to leave names in the review as I take people's lively hoods very seriously. They sent two tech's one senior and one junior. The senior tech came a little late and had to leave early. He was very knowledgable. The other tech performed the work. They asked me to clear the entry in the closet as they wanted to inspect it. I was impressed up till the point nobody ever went to check the space. The other issue is I bought two new air filters as I knew it was time for them to be replaced and it was listed as one of the items they look at. I showed the junior tech where they were and he said no problem and he would switch them out. He came back and said he was all done so I paid him. Right after he left I went out to make sure the covers we on the furnace as it won't operate without them. That is where I found the new filters I bought sitting next to the furnace. I agree with the senior tech's assesment to replace my system but unfortunatey I won't be getting a quote from them.<//text>< Rating>

< Review>
Really bad customer service overall, system that was installed 6 years ago and still under warranty finally broke a week ago, called for service and did not get a call back, after a week of waiting called again to schedule an appointment and the best they can do is with in 5 business days to look at my week old air conditioning problem, that will be to weeks to wait for a service tech.

The system was not installed right from day one, the design of the return that was agreed on was not the one installed, the system is very noisy and vibrate on the wall, complain about it and took them 2 years to drop by and take a look at it, nothing was wrong with the unit, its normal for airconditioning unit to be noisy when in use and leave vibration on your wall that you cant even use it at night just to get some sleep.

Guess what I had it with this going around and around, next stop BBB. I dont get what i want, theres more online blogs and other thing out there, facebook, twitter, instagram, google + and so on, don't you love social media. Good Luck Blocking my post Service Champion.< /Review>

My vent wouldn't shut off.  I called Service Champions and Travis was out to home in about 45 minutes.  He observed the problem and everything was back to normal in about 40 minutes.  His disposition and expertise made my day.

Thanks to Travis.< /Review>

This company has given me good service over the past few years. I'm on the maintenance program so they come out twice a year and service my heating and air system. When it's time for a service appointment they call me up and remind me and schedule the appointment, and the technicians have always been on time, knowlegable, and friendly. Kyle Dahl worked on my system today and he found a few problems that he explained in detail to me and let me know what my options were. I didn't feel as though I was being scammed (like I read in pevious review on here), even my ornery chihuahua liked him...and that's saying something!</Review>

I have a Trane XE70 gas furnance and it hasn't been working properly. I called Service Champions due to their history in the area and an add in the mail to come out, complete a tune up, and diagnose the problem. This was back in 2010 and the technician did the "tune up" and stated I needed a new furnance that would run me around $15k. He stated however if I just mess with a couple of wires the heater would ignite. I didn't bother doing anything with it since I was able to pull on some wires (recommended by a Service Champion employee which is a liability in itself) however this latest season has been pretty cold and pulling on the wires has not been working very well. I did 10-15 minutes research online and discovered I just need to replace the gas valve part #VAL09377 as per a diagnosis from a Trane technician who knew of this common problem with this model furnance. I called Service Champions and advised of the last visit in 2010 that was very unhelpful and seemed as prior reviews a scam and was blown off told that it was back in 2010 and they are under different management (same company). I was told they would take a whole $30 off of another visit (I live 2 miles away from their store) and it would only cost $40 to come back out. I told them I might call them back. I am in the customer service industry and this is by far not the way to take care of a situation like this. When a customer calls again even after feeling taken advantage of, try to give you another chance for a sale, and they express a concern why would you not try to make it right or direct the customer's concern to someone that can? I would not recommend this company to ANYONE. Do your own research online to diagnose the problem and then call around for an estimate for the labor only. Buy the part yourself.</text>
